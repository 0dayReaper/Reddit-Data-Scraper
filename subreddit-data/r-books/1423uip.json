            "comment": "&gt; Eco separated his visitors into two categories: \u201cthose who react with \u2018Wow! Signore professore dottore Eco, what a library you have. How many of these books have you read\u2019 and the others \u2014 a very small minority \u2014 who get the point is that a private library is not an ego-boosting appendages but a research tool.\u201d\n\nThe fact that people here don't even realize Eco was a researcher and probably needed his library as a... library! To research things! Because back then there weren't any e-readers or digital books, back in the 70s-80s-90s, hell even most 2000s lmaooo so if you had to research specific topics you couldn't even go to a normal library, you had to go to a specialized one to get your piece of information! And I can safely assume Italy's libraries state was even worse than it is now, so having a lot of books made sense for someone like Eco.",

Anyone who became faculty prior to the early 2000's tends to have a large personal library in their office with many textbooks, handbooks, and product manuals in an entire bookcase. Anyone from 2010's onward might have a single shelf of books. \n\nPre-00s researchers were trained in an era where having all that general information at arms length was both necessary AND convenient. For a lot of faculty coming in now, myself included, your bookshelf is just relevant textbooks from your undergrad and professional school you never sold back.",

Why take up space with books I thought were merely average or outright bad?\n\nWhen I finish a book, I don't need to run to the bookstore or the library for another one.  I have plenty to choose from right here.",

You might be working on something and want a reference at hand, but otherwise wouldn't use the book.  Just like how I have tools and sockets for wrenches I haven't used, but might need in a future project.\n\nBut in another part of the article the shelves are described more like a fashion statement.  Look how many unread books I have, that shows how much I actually know!  Or later in the article, it's a decoration to remind you there's a lot of knowledge out there.  I guess people need to keep lining their walls unless they somehow forget this fact.\n\nAnd then the article closes with a statement I don't really agree with - that unread books are ok, as long as they're valuable knowledge.  As if books you haven't read but are just for fun titles aren't ok to have.\n\nOverall not a great article, and not really any great points being made within it, I'd say.\n\nBuy what you want, read what you want, but pull your head out about why you have unread books.",

It makes me almost resent them.  (I know I can, but it feels a bit like stopping for fast food when you\u2019ve just grocery shopped. Vaguely guilty)\n\nI also feel like I end up trying to race through one book because I have lots of other good ones waiting. \n\nIf I lived in a bubble where I never learned of new books it might work. As is, I\u2019m trying to get my unread pile down to a reasonable level so I can start exploring new ones. It\u2019s actually quite good on the wallet though.",

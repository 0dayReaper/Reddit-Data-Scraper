First stop was to the library (public &amp; university) to see if they had a copy I could checkout (or if they could get me one on interlibrary loan). Then the next stop was searching for the book online. I was a history &amp; polisci undergrad, so a lot of my books were not the standard textbook. If they were cheap used I would buy them, and if they weren't I'd look for \"alternatives.\" If that didn't work, I had 2 final option from my university library. They were required to have at least 1 copy of every book available at all times in addition to whatever was in the stacks (essentially, there was 1 copy you couldn't checkout). If the only copy they had was the one you couldn't checkout, the I'd either scan it using their scanner or go to the print shop and have them copy it for me (depending on how lazy I was and how much of the book needed to be copied). \n\nI recently learned they closed that print shop, which is really sad because a lot of the history professors used it to create custom binders full of primary sources to use as the textbook. They'd tell us to go buy it for $20 or so and it was everything we needed for the semester.",

If you don\u2019t have a professor (or department) writing their own curriculum and assignments, then you might as well be doing community college or a cheaper online option.

Their textbook model makes it completely prohibitive for most libraries to keep up with too (we\u2019d blow our budget if we had to buy these textbooks, so many libraries including mine simply don\u2019t). Anyway, I just wanted to add my perspective from the other side: your loathing is not misplaced, and is indeed shared by many instructors.

Getting a college degree is pretty much a requirement to getting a decent white-collar job nowadays, so colleges have shifted to shaking as much money as they can out of students as possible.\n\nI got into one of the best business schools in the country when I went to college. During my time there, an alumni donated nine-figures and the school used that to rebuild my business school entirely during my time there. As a result, we didn't get to use the facilities as much as past or future classes did, yet we still had our tuition raised because of the \"better facilities\" coming in. \n\nYou'd think a donation of that size would reduce the burden students have. But all colleges care about is creating groundbreaking buildings and gaining more prestige. And that's not even getting to ticky-tack stuff like books which should be regulated.\n\nThere are real ways to solve the student debt issue without waiting to forgive loans the next time around. Public schools shouldn't be able to nickle and dime their students and should be making a better effort to get students into society with minimal debt IMO.",

A couple things need to happen to make it work (a) we need to be aware of the required text (the teacher or program needs to inform us they are adopting a specific title) and (b) an unlimited (or equivalent) user license needs to be available for library purchase. The license type helps us ensure that all students will be able to access the book simultaneously without getting locked out.--just buying 1 or 2 user licenses doesn't help a whole class.\n\nIn many instances, the ebooks we get won't have all the bells and whistles the publisher provides (certain types of supplementary materials, etc.) but we've been really successful with this collection development model. It is to the point now where the majority of our program managers and faculty will ask if a license is available before deciding to adopt a new text. It's really helped our students save A LOT of money. However, for it to work, you need a certain amount of communication between the library and faculty. If you are faculty at a university, I highly recommend coordinating with your librarian to explore the purchase options available for any texts you adopt.",

I collect all course materials data from our faculty every semester and we do everything we can to get unlimited licenses based in what they've chosen. It is a huge chore though. About a third of faculty think we are monitoring what they use for nefarious purposes, or just don't care to participate.\n\nThe eBooks we purchase have literally saved students millions since we began our program. It's not all bad, if you can get it working.",

After that I changed how I purchased books.\n\nI stopped purchasing books in advance and waited until the first day of classes to find out if I would need the book. In some cases I had professors straight up tell us, \"don't buy the book, the college insisted that I have one, but we wont use it.\" In many cases the book was just used as reference material and wouldn't be used for reading or assignments and would just be used for studying - Essentially, you could find those types of resources online.\n\nFor most semesters the \"mandatory 5 books\" became purchasing 1-2 books.\n\nAt that point I'd find out what edition was being used, and if it actually mattered to go an edition back or two.  I would then go on [half.com](https://half.com) \\[no longer around\\] and buy my 1-2 books for a grand total of $10-$15 each.\n\nIn one case I had a super awesome math teacher who told me, \"yea, the problems will be different, but as long as you write the problem out for homework I'm fine with it.\" The same teacher let me copy my HW out of her edition until my books arrived.",

The fact that students have still had to pay full tuition costs INCLUDING dorm fees even though they\u2019re 100% off campus and online tells you everything you need to know. Furthermore, the fact that the places where people go to educate themselves were some of the first entities to say, \u201cyeah! Come on back!\u201d in the middle of a raging pandemic is also a clear sign that they don\u2019t care about anything other than the dollar. And now this story. It\u2019s unbelievable.",

I'm an academic librarian, and my general disdain for commercial textbook publishers has morphed into full-on aggressive loathing over the past year. In addition to the price gouging, they refuse to sell their ebooks to libraries. My uni's entire library system has been closed since March 2020, so we've been scrambling to get students the resources they need online. But we can't get these textbooks, because the greedy publishers won't sell them to us. So we've been trying to get profs to use alternate textbooks which we already own as ebooks or which we can buy, but lots of the profs won't or can't switch. So we can do nothing for the students and they're forced to either spend an exorbitant amount for a fucking computer file, or somehow muddle through without. It's a disgrace and now I fantasize about hunting down the CEO of McGraw-Hill John Wick-style.",

These universities are not money greedy, but money needy, since they are subject to governments that have historically pushed more financial costs on to students while putting a tight stranglehold on what the colleges and universities in their system can do.\n\nThese schools often can't choose otherwise legally. If they have any choice at all, it's an existential one between closing down entirely or laying off most employees and maintaining operations.\n\nIn this case, it isn't even the universities that are raising prices. It is book publishers. Often the increase in costs come from organizations outside the university, or private organizations with government contracts to serve public universities. For instance - to connect it back to dorm fees - the dorms in many US states are run by private contractors; states outsourced these services to save money and now are locked into contracts to maintain a certain level of capacity or pay loads of money. Reminders from companies like Corvias may have led universities to open on-campus housing for last fall ([Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/08/07/housing-developer-reminded-universities-about-project-debt-they-mulled-fall-plans)).\n\nSo restoring funding levels at state universities and bringing private contracts back under public control may have allowed many colleges and universities to operate in the public interest.",

Never buy a book until after you have been to the class for a week to determine if you will, in fact, use the book.\n2. Always buy used, and from a third party. \n3. Buy the previous edition. Very few changes are made between editions. Most changes are limited to the cover, images inside, and errors made. The previous edition will almost always work for the class, and can be purchased for a fraction of the cost.",

            "comment": "Former community college instructor here. I used to teach laboratory classes at my local college. Within the first semester, one of the strange things I've noticed was that students were required to purchase the textbook associated with my lab. The cost was $180 for a new book, and the publisher asked $120 for used. Before that, I was a college student that felt scammed due to the insane prices of the textbooks.\n\nI then thought to myself, why can't I just write it myself and charge them way cheaper? And that's what I did. After my first semester was over, I spent the winter break writing the course material myself. My college didn't have the tools I needed to bind them, so I bought cheap binders from Walmart, printed the stuff on a laser printer front and back pages to save as much as possible. The quality looked below par, but the text was still legible. On average, I spent about $100 to prepare a set of 20 books. I asked for $20 each, and every single student went for this option instead. Yes, I know I was being a greedy bastard at 400% ROI, but the students were happy because they actually used the booklet.\n\nAnother semester passes, as I made changes to the 1st edition, correcting mistakes here and there, and then another student suggests why not distribute it online? I said, okay. My 3rd semester, I had a PDF version that I distributed to students for free. I mean what's the point in charging them if they just easily distribute them? Not that I had a problem with that. I eventually lowered the physical copy to $9; some students still bought the hardcopy version.\n\nSurprisingly, my department chairman applauded me saying the publisher's textbook was too much \"mumbo jumbo\" and thanked me for taking the extra step.\n\nEventually the publisher discovered what I was doing and demanded that I stopped doing it. I refused. Eventually I was asked to leave for \"not complying with academic standards\". Three years later when I paid a visit back to the college, I noticed the new instructor was also using my version, but decided to rebrand under his name since I never copyrighted it myself. I didn't care; I was just happy the publisher withdrew and that the students didn't have to be forced to shell out unnecessary money.",

Just wanted to call out this paragraph as only thinly veiling what they're saying--   \n\n\n&gt; A similar situation unfolded in Florida last month when JetBlue, Delta and American voluntarily restrained ticket prices on flights  out of Florida before the hurricane. By dropping prices during the  evacuation, the airlines ensured that flights filled up more quickly,  making it harder for many to escape. Some evacuees no doubt booked  multiple low-cost flights after prices dropped as a hedge against  cancellation. Paying a premium for airline tickets is unpleasant, but  letting seats go to waste during an evacuation is tragic. \n\nWho are low cost tickets making it harder to escape for? Well, rich people, who normally would be comfortable in the knowledge that poor people couldn't afford price gouged tickets, so they can book an expensive plane ticket at their leisure. \n\n&gt;Some evacuees no doubt booked  multiple low-cost flights after prices dropped as a hedge against  cancellation\n\nAlso, who the fuck buys multiple airline tickets? Not most people-- only the rich could afford to do something so stupid. The thing that's not being said here is 'price gouging works great for people who can afford gouged prices, and fuck you if you can't'.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not arguing, pretty sure everyone here is on the same page, but this shit made me so mad I had to dissect it a bit.",

One way or another, it's going to happen.\n\nStudents: demand that your instructors use either sanely-priced or free open textbooks. Refuse to purchase over-priced books. Refuse to take classes that require them. You have the power to force your instructors and your schools to change.\n\nInstructors: educate yourselves on your options. Check out [https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks) for a library of over 800 free, professionally-reviewed textbooks in a wide variety of subjects, free from encumbering and exploitative copyright restrictions.\\*\n\nAdministrators: realize that the higher-education apocalypse is coming. The bubble is going to pop very soon. If you are not prepared to compete for a much, much smaller total population of students, who will be choosing schools *almost exclusively* on value, then your institution will go bankrupt and you will lose your job. Focus on value *now*, because by the time the bubble pops it will be too late to change.\n\n\\*Preemptive note to mods: this is not piracy.

There is absolutely nothing illegal about freely using and redistributing these books in accordance with their specific licenses.",

We used Judson's \"Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications\" and for the material it covers it was every bit as good as the competition.  I had plenty of students who could barely afford a decent meal; like hell I'm gonna ask them to spend two months' grocery budget to learn a 100-year-old theorem.\n\nProfessors don't get kickbacks (AFAIK) for the textbooks they pick, so why in God's name they assigning $500 textbooks when there are perfectly good free resources out there?  The only possibility I can see is that they are either completely out-of-touch with their students or are just too lazy to adapt their old lecture notes to a new book.",

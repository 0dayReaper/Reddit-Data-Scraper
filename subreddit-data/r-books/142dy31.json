NLP it to translate it into every language. \n\nThen get it formatted for printers in all of those countries to be bound in their traditional style and size (different countries have different 'standard' typesets) and before all of that it edits it for spelling errors (which is the bane for most 1st edition prints)   \n\nHell you could even have it write the back of the book synopsis.  \n\nI think for indie publishers or even self publishers it would be a great way to do it yourself.",

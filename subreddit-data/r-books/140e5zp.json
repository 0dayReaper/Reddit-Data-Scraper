    "postText": "I have those two people who, talking to them, the books we have read will often be the topic of conversation. They will always tell me about certain insights of the book they have read, as if it was more of an phylosophical idea they have read than a story. I wonder how they get to that point? I know there are people on here who have a similar reading experience than them so I\u00b4d like to know how it works for you. Does this sort of stuff just pop into your head while experiencing the story? Is it clear for you or do you actively try to think about what the things you take in mean? And how does it feel to pull an insight from a story?\n\nAnd if your reading experience is different, if it is not insight you gain from a story but something else, what is it?\n\nI wish I could ask them but to be honest, at times I feel a bit ashamed. As if my consumption of books is sort of passive or as if I didn\u00b4t think deep enough. I do get certain insights when I read books but they are alway Ideas, never conclusions and there is not one big thing I take from it but rather small things that pop up in between the pages and that I can\u00b4t all recall at the end of the story.  Though the story itself is what I recall very well.\n\nI feel as if it is connected but I don\u00b4t really know how, I also cannot tell when the author is sort of lying to me. Like, with some (always rather old) books I have read there has been some magical stuff happening and only through discussion did i find out that this was a metaphor for some other thing that was happening rather than just some cool magical element to the story.",

            "comment": "If a story has no insights to offer I'm unlikely to read it. I mean, I read some shallow ass shit sometimes, so it's not a 100% certainty, but the general point of reading to me is to engage something with depth.\n\nYou hit the nail on the head on the word passive, though. Passive reading is just going through the words, understanding what they mean, and getting to the end. There's nothing wrong with this if it's all you want, but if you wanted to get more out of the books you read, you do need to be actively thinking the whole time. Why is this scene here? Why is this worded this way and not the million other ways you could say the same thing? What does this story remind me of re: my own life and lived experiences?\n\nYou're already well on the way by noticing small insights. Expand on them, take note of them. Put them together at the end. Write them somewhere on a piece of paper if you really want to remember them but don't.\n\nUltimately the reason some people can read deeply and some can't is a matter of education. A good English education includes the tools for literary criticism, and that's all deep reading ultimately is. You can learn it as an adult.",

It takes time to learn this school and really thinking about what the author is trying to say.",

As I read, I've always found that my mind automatically connects to different ideas and issues. It could be that it makes a new concept \"click\" for me, connects to or builds on an idea I've already thought about in the past, something related to events in the external world, or a more personal insight. I like to keep a reading notebook with me so that I can get ideas out as needed. \n\nBecause it's something that tends to come automatically, I'm not sure I can really explain the \"how\". I think its going to be different for everyone. That said, keeping in mind things like power and relationship dynamics in a novel could be one stepping stone to picking up on other themes and concepts. \n\n&gt;And how does it feel to pull an insight from a story?\n\nHonestly, I've always found it exciting. It's a big part of what makes reading so much fun for me.",

If you have had trauma or betrayal in your life, you are more likely to see that in the book for example. Also sometimes people see things in a book that are not the intentions of the author. \n\nI'm nearly 60 and well-educated, but I don't often get metaphors. I read a lot of mystery, thrillers, and detective type stories, so I go into the book looking for clues. Looking for people's motivations etc. I don't approach all books this way, some I just read and let the story wash over me. \n\nI also rarely read reviews or read the summary or join discussions about the book. If you want to get better at finding hidden meaning in books, you might want to spend some time reading what other people feel about a book that you just finished.",

The human (or other humanoid beings I guess) psyche and its limits, explored through the lens of fantasy, hits my sweet spot.\n\nWith that said, what I take from a book is usually about the human mind, how it reacts to different things and always, always comparing it to me and others I know. What would I have done in that situation? What would you have done? What does it take to do what that character did? Is it possible? How?\n\nMy questions usually run along that line, and I find it makes me more determined in every day life to do better, because if that character could do it then so can I.

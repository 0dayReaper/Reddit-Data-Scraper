She states in the beginning he would have been the leading world expert if he hadn't given up. He proved that by getting Astrophage to replicate before any leading scientists could. She got him tested right away and had him have the training needed to be apart of the mission. Dubois and Shapiro were specifically the personality type she was concerned would go crazy in space...",

    "postText": "The way I've seen/heard it referenced it always seemed like a totalitarian government destroys books and creates meaningless entertainment to distract the masses.\n\nIn reality, it's about people getting offended over nothing and demanding the government destroy offensive media but eventually  the people get too sensitive so that the only thing left is meaningless entertainment. The parallels to today make me feel uncomfortable.\n\nAm I misunderstanding or were most people misquoting?\n\nEDIT: I see now, I took a shallow view of what I remembered. Actually going back to it, especially Beatty's monologue, I see both ideas are a part of it but so is people not wanting to bother with complex ideas, and apparently Bradbury hates technology. Maybe one part over sensitivity, one part government involvement, and two parts people wanting instant gratification. I still believe it's mostly the fault of the people\n\nAlso, Holy Cow! I did not expect such an overwhelming response",

For example, \"The Beach\" with Leonardo DiCaprio released to below-average reviews, but every single time I watch that movie, I feel something special.

The bitter-sweet memories take me back to a time that seems like yesterday, and the emotion is just as raw as it was back then.\n\nIt's all about what it makes *you* feel - no one else.\n\nEdit: I'm an aspiring filmmaker so I can get kinda pretentious with this stuff, but all I can hope for is to some day create something that incites the same amount of emotion I feel when I watch this.\n\nEdit 2: Also the soundtrack is pretty good. I'd suggest [Moby - Porcelain.](https://youtu.be/QhZnEagfjTQ) I actually listen to this regularly to help me fall asleep, it's so chill and the production is deeper than you'd expect. ",

This movie didn't *have* to be sexy and musical. Those are just like extra perks, but when you add those perks, it's a classic.",

An important part of an editor's job as I try to do it is to change what the author wrote into what they meant to write, but to do it with the smallest changes possible. Sometimes that's as simple as splitting one sentence into two, or a word substitution, but these changes can also be significantly more that just correcting errors. Sometimes you have to completely rework a sentence or paragraph that the author was never going to get right, and you get feedback saying, 'yes, that's what I meant to say all along!' And sometimes you have to make cuts, and sometimes you have to tell the author, 'you gotta rewrite this section'. So it's a red herring to believe that what you see in the final print version is exactly character for character what issued from the author's keyboard. It just won't be.\n\nAnd then there's translated works, where the translator has to get the content into the right language before the editor can even start on it, so that's another layer of complication, and another stage removed from 'the author's original intent'. The changes that have to be wrought upon translated works can be fascinating to study. I bet a few here have read the Asterix and Obelix books, for example, in more than one language.",

Each time I complete one, and then submit to a couple of friends for editing and honest feedback, I get new insight into my work-- both in order to edit and improve my work, or simply to nod my head and say, \"wow, I didn't see that,\" and let it ride along as the work is submitted to publishing. \n\nSo, sometimes those \"deeper meanings\" that were discussed in my English and literature classes may have been intended by the author, and sometimes they were just newly emerged as the confluence of the author's creation combined with the readers imagination and experience.

I do not know your dreams. Perhaps you do not dream of a veldt that is only wallpaper but that eats two children. Perhaps you do not know that Mars Is Heaven, where our beloved dead go to wait for us, then consume us in the night. You do not dream of a man arrested for the crime of being a pedestrian.\n\nI dream these things.\n\nIf he existed, then I have lost him. Lost his name. Lost his book titles, one by one by one. Lost the stories.\n\nAnd I fear that I am going mad, for I cannot just be growing old.\n\nIf I have failed in this one task, oh God, then only let me do this thing, that you may give the stories back to the world.\n\nBecause, perhaps, if this works, they will remember him. All of them will remember him. His name will once more become synonymous with small American towns at Hallowe'en, when the leaves skitter across the sidewalk like frightened birds, or with Mars, or with love. And my name will be forgotten.\n\nI am willing to pay that price, if the empty space in the bookshelf of my mind can be filled again, before I go.\n\nDear God, hear my prayer.\n\nA . . . B . . .

Where TV has immediacy and an audiovisual nature, it lacks the depth and logical flow that a printed work is able to contain. If people consume both TV and print media in an engaging, intellectual manner, they can benefit from the strengths of both; however, Postman (and Bradbury in *Fahrenheit 451*, as well as Orwell in *1984* and Huxley in *Brave New World*) feared that society was slipping into an intellectually lazy single-stream of media consumption, with reduced attention spans.\n\nInterestingly enough, Postman, writing in 1985, never thought computers would take off, nor did he foresee the Internet. Looking at it today, I would argue his thesis still holds water with regard to short attention spans in Twitter and Snapchat (which can and do have legitimate uses), but is also tempered by an availability of lengthy scientific papers as well as some good discussion forums (I would point to some academic subreddits like AskHistorians as an example); however\u2014proving his point\u2014TL;DR culture exists.\n\nEdit: Wrong author; added a couple other references.",

As such, two people can read the same book and have very different experiences.\n\nI think it's also the case that an author may touch on or express some truths of which the author, himself, is entirely unaware. \n\nThat said, I'm not sure these are really mutually exclusive. I think that the problem in the idea that an author can be *wrong* about his own work is the tacit assumption that there is *one* correct interpretation.\n\nIf there is not, then it's entirely possible that the author's intent and interpretation of his work may be the primary meaning, but that there are also *other* meanings that people have found in the work that are true, as well.",

                            "comment": "I became friends with Ray when I was an actor in a repertory company in L.A.   Ray was sort of our resident playwrite.  We did original stage adaptations of \"The Martian Chronicles\", \"Fahrenheit 451\",  \"Dandelion Wine\" (as a musical) and \"Leviathan 99\".  \n\nFor a nerd like me becoming friends with Ray was like hanging out with The Beatles.  He was a genuinely warm person who just LOVED being Ray Bradbury.  He attended many of our performances, always dressed in a white \"ice cream suit\", and made himself available to chat with everyone during intermission and after the show.\n\nI got to know him \"one to one\" during technical rehearsals for \"Fahrenheit\".  One afternoon the rehearsal was running way behind schedule so I asked Ray if he wanted to go get a drink at a nearby German pub.  We spent the next few hours talking about his books and chatting with others in the pub.  I confessed to Ray that I had long considered him my \"intellectual father.\"  By the end of the evening between the two of us we had figured out how to solve all the world's problems.  He said, \"Now all we have to do is completely restructure society.\"\n\nRay did not drive and avoided flying.  Let me repeat that: Ray did not drive a car.  Living in Los Angeles, Ray refused to drive a car, instead taking a taxi everywhere he wanted to go.  Whenever he attended one of our parties at the theatre or at someone's home the taxi driver would join us, with the meter running!\n\nOne of my favorite memories was a night when his childhood friend, the movie director Ray Harryhousen came to see one of our shows.  Harryhousen wrote and directed some of my favorite childhood movies, like \"Jason and the Argonauts\" and \"The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad.\"  Both Maggie Bradbury and Mrs. Harryhousen were there along with Harryhousen's 18 year old daughter.  They were all going to dinner together and Ray graciously invited me to come along, probably to make it an even boy-girl-boy-girl seating arrangement.  ( I was 27, the girl was 18 and didn't have much to say.)  I got to sit there and ask questions of and listen to stories from two of my childhood idols.\n\nI regret that I lost contact with Ray for probably the last ten years of his life.  The last time we spoke was the day before one of our Mars rovers landed.  Ray had been invited to watch the event from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, and I called to plead to be taken along.  He explained that he wished he could accommodate me but the number of guests was very limited.  Not long after I quit show business and left Los Angeles and was saddened to learn of his passing. One of my cherished possessions is a poster of our production of \"The Martian Chronicles\" which Ray autographed for me with the inscription \"To \"requisitename\", with Awe and Admiration.  Ray Bradbury.\"  I have it framed and hanging in my home.\n",

The simplest example is that in BNW people are culled at age 60, to prevent speculation about mortality and what it means to exist. \n\nThe total theme in the book is to provoke thought about what a perfect society is. \n\nBrave New World in my opinion is one the best Utopian/Distopian books, because it never forces morality onto societial structures, just explores them.

The fact that Aldous Huxley was able to write this almost a century ago makes me wonder if whatever drugs he was taking allowed him to glimpse into the future. Modern society and the one in Brave New World are sickeningly similar, right down to the proliferation of prescription drugs and oversimplification of our media. It felt like I was reading a prophecy.\n\nAll the other books made me think it would be a nightmare to live in their world. Brave New World was the first one that really made me think, would it be so bad? That's what made it so real. You felt like, not only could this happen, but you would let it and be fine with it, all without realizing what was happening.  ",

Fahrenheit 451 is not, he says firmly, a story about government censorship. Nor was it a response to Senator Joseph McCarthy, whose investigations had already instilled fear and stifled the creativity of thousands.\n\n&gt;This, despite the fact that reviews, critiques and essays over the decades say that is precisely what it is all about. Even Bradbury\u2019s authorized biographer, Sam Weller, in The Bradbury Chronicles, refers to Fahrenheit 451 as a book about censorship.\n\n&gt;Bradbury, a man living in the creative and industrial center of reality TV and one-hour dramas, says it is, in fact, a story about how television destroys interest in reading literature.\n\n&gt;\u201cTelevision gives you the dates of Napoleon, but not who he was,\u201d Bradbury says, summarizing TV\u2019s content with a single word that he spits out as an epithet: \u201cfactoids.\u201d He says this while sitting in a room dominated by a gigantic flat-panel television broadcasting the Fox News Channel, muted, factoids crawling across the bottom of the screen.\n\n&gt;His fear in 1953 that television would kill books has, he says, been partially confirmed by television\u2019s effect on substance in the news. The front page of that day\u2019s L.A. Times reported on the weekend box-office receipts for the third in the Spider-Man series of movies, seeming to prove his point.\n\nhttp://www.laweekly.com/news/ray-bradbury-fahrenheit-451-misinterpreted-2149125\n\nThe TL/DR is that Bradbury was annoyed as fuck that people thought it was about government censorship and not about the pernicious influence of TV in destroying our interest in literature.\n\n\n",

He had to make a world that could possibly escalate from his own world. \n\nSo no you are not misunderstanding. You are just correcting the false impressions you got before reading, like we all do. \n\nInterestingly enough I had a similar experience with a novel.

This bears out historically where tyrannies are concerned, just as the former situation appears to jive with current events.\n\nPersonally, I think it wasn't one or the other but both.

Or the people might have elected a government that bans books because books represent a kind of difficult thinking and engagement with the world that makes them uncomfortable.\n\nIt seems pretty clear (to me) that everyone in the novel is deeply traumatised from living in a state of endless war, with nuclear annihilation a constant threat. (Not unlike the state of the world when Bradbury wrote the novel.) They deal with this by pursuing distraction and trivialities to the point of obsession, which is not an uncommon way of coping with stress and anxiety.\n\nBut it's an unhealthy one, of course, and it's easy to see how society as a whole could start to turn against those who keep pointing that out and trying to get them to examine the root cause of the anxiety that everyone is struggling with. The burning of books is more a symbol of the way that the citizens are suppressing deep or uncomfortable thoughts than it is a literal system of control by a literal totalitarian government. (Not unlike the memory holes in *1984*, though that book obviously *also* has a literal totalitarian government in it.)",

    "postText": "I was thinking to myself - where did things really go wrong for Damon? Who failed him? Obviously, he was failed by many people and the child services system, but one person stands out to me.\n\nMs. Betsy. This woman refuses to raise her own grandson (while raising countless other children) solely because he\u2019s a boy. She then finds him a family, but the dad is an absent, alcoholic, father whose whole focus is football. \n\nThings are fine for a while but after Damon gets hurt, she shows up to scold him for missing school and essentially disowns him. If anyone should be sticking up for this orphan, it\u2019s his Grandmother. Surely she knows he was in an accident and can see that he is unwell as he walks with an injury that never healed. She could even ask Damon how he is doing and why he is skipping school instead of just dropping him. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how she could be ok with letting a stranger raise her grandchild while she continues to raise random other kids.\n\nWho do you think failed Damon the most? Am I being too hard on Ms. Betsy?",

She had the space, funds, inclination but didn't want to bring in boys (except her brother).  Failed by the system, neighbors, fosters was harsh but the willful hands off approach from Ms. Betsy was really hard to understand.  Especially if she really did fight his mother early on for contact.  I fully agree and you are not too hard on Ms. Betsy.",

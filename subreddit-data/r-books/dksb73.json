I can't say I LOVE Amy Adams, so my reading of Sharp Objects was seriously hindered by imagining her as the main character nonstop. Why put real photographs of people on book covers anyway!\n\nI honestly think the state of book covers is atrocious. Half the time they all look like the same Photoshop *drivel, and the other half they're just famous actors from their adaptations.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the silver and gold, fellow redditors! I had no idea this would blow up, but it's nice to know others share my opinion.",

I can, when concentrating, pull up what is like a subliminal message image: a super brief flash, not long enough to make out the whole image, only parts. It's like seeing a slighty blurry image with huge amounts of tunnel vision. No movement, only brief flashes of shapes and detail,.\n\nThats what memories look like to me, I can recollect the base shapes of about half my childhood home's facade each time I try, and combine it with feelings and emotions of playing in a garden as a child to make the whole memory.\n\nFaces are a similar problem. I have no issue recounting how a face looks or all its features but I can only ever 'see' anything close to a whole face in my head after a minute or so of trying and meticulously crafting the face based on what I know of it: remembering and saying to myself information about eyes, cheeks, hair, notable features like glasses and the like. I take this and try to superimpose the on each other. More complex details like finer facial structure or specific things like hair apart from the general structure escape me. Noses in particular I can never do.",

While I personally cannot conjure an image of even the simplest or most important thing some people might be able to make an image if they really consetrate or if it made a strong impression on them.\nFor me my dreams are more like an audiobook or podcast, I have the sounds and feelings but not the pictures, with strong memories it is the same. Meanwhile some things, like the apple example someone else posted, is just a list of descriptions.\nIf I really want to remember a special moment with visuals I might look at a picture while I'm thinking about it, but that won't turn into a \"video clip\" or stay in my mind if I look away. Because of this having pictures of important times and people I love hanging around is really important to me.",

It seems to me like the sort of thing that could be behind a lot of the differences between people. \n\nA simple example of how this goes against common assumptions: One of the methods of full sensory VR that fiction has come up with, is to take advantage of dreams and manipulate them. However, if people like you exist that don't have full sensory dreams, then that entire concept is likely to fail (or be significantly less effective than imagined) for a great many people. It's a reminder that humans are often far more different from one another than we realize because we just don't ask about \"obvious\" things.\n\nP.S. I'm personally of the opinion that if every curse has a secret blessing, then every blessing has a secret curse too. Yes, there are benefits to not having all the extra sensory imagination, but there are also hindrances as well, and this is true of almost every setup. I have a very strong imagination myself, and it's wonderful for keeping myself entertained, but I have trouble turning it off when I need to focus on other things. I expect your situation would be like an opposite of mine. A much easier time avoiding distraction, but a much harder time staying entertained when there's nothing to do. \n\nIt's likely that I am missing out on benefits you take for granted, and that you are missing out on benefits I take for granted. I'm curious to know what those are, but I don't really know how to find out.",

I find there's a sliding scale too. Some books I'm picturing everything, all the movement, objects etc, but other times I might just have a static idea of the scene or setting, but not much detail or movement.\n\nAll that said, I don't think I've ever pictured imaginary faces unless the book went massively out of its way to describe facial features in detail. Even when there's faces on a cover, or I've seen a show/movie based on the book, I often don't carry over the actors' faces in my mind.",

He claimed some phenomenal reading speed and I am still sceptical he could read that fast and retain any details about it. Regardless of his supposed self-inflated abilities, he was still powering through them quickly. He couldn't understand why it took me so much longer to read a book than him.\n\nThen he discovered that I imagine the scenes in the story in real time in my head. If I try reading faster the images in my head don't play out at the right speed and get all disjointed. Then it was my turn to not understand how he couldn't do that.",

To be fair, Gandalf is probably the only character I felt the Lord of the Rings movie adaptation got right. Everyone else was either too handsome and less gruff or gaunty.  \n\n\nThe entire Harry Potter series was perfect, except Hermione once the third movie rolled in. She became less an awkward person to look at and more like the kind of character that always gets hit on by other students.",

Draper in the book is a large, muscular, intimidating woman. The actress in the show is not, but she is the correct ethnicity, and trying to find a good actress that fits the book character would be super hard. All that said, the actress is great and I love her version of the character. I just cringe when they make her out to be super strong compared to large men when you can see she her arms are twigs in comparison. Still wouldn't change the actress, just wish they would slightly adapt the character more to her physical traits.",

But in the end, we need to make a bookcover that sells.\" \n\nAuthors, when given free reign, *can* and often will communicate the wrong genre, want a faulty composition for their book cover, or give the whole story away instead of drawing the reader in. They're story experts after all, not marketing or visual experts. I deal with directing certain intent into the right visual language every day.\n\nThat being said, I also hate this movie book cover trend. Imagination instantly ruined.",

That's fine, but is this literally the only story it's possible to tell about robots? Every single robot story is this same damn plot. What if we make some rules that ensure we don't get a Frankenstein scenario... Could robots do something more interesting than just rebel against their creators every single time?\"  \n\nHollywood Producers: \"Hey, here's an idea. Let's use Asimov's IP to create a robot movie... but instead of whatever it was that he wrote about, let's make it a Frankenstein story!!\"",

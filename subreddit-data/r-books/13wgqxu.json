    "postText": "\"the book was better\" and it always will be. So I would like to know some movies that have inspired you to read the books. Also the best and worst, book rating not adaptation.\n\nFor me my favorite discovery was \"The Magicians\" series from watching the show. Both both show and books are magical and tell different stories of the same people. One doesn't ruin the other which is nice. \n\n\nWorst was probably \"Red Sparrow\". I am sure it was my temperament at the time but I couldn't really get into the book and only made it 1/3 in.",

I\u2019ve read the first two books so far, well audio books, and they\u2019re alright but I like the movie more. \n\nI\u2019ve read the short story Stories of Your Life which the movie Arrival is based off of and it\u2019s really good, but the movie is better. \n\nThen I\u2019ve also read Band of Brothers and Helmet for My Pillow which were books used to inspire the mini series Band of Brothers and part of The Pacific. There are some minor differences but I enjoyed them equally. I do plan to read With the Old Breed which is the other book The Pacific is based off of.",

It's rare, but there have been occasions where the movie was actually better than the book.  And plenty of times where the book and movie were equally good.  \n\nI read Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Jaws, The Man Who Would Be King, The Godfather, Jurassic Park, The Virgin Suicides, True Grit, and Holes because of the movies (and plenty of others, but those I can recall off the top of my head).  Those are all on my list of equally good movies and books.\n\nWorst was I read Practical Magic after adoring the movie.  Ugh.  That is on the top of my \"Movie is actually better than the book\" list.  Closely tied with The Princess Bride.  \n\nBut I know people will now be curious, so here's my lists:\n\nMovies/Books (equal):\r  \nTo Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee\n\nJurassic Park by Michael Crichton\n\nThe Man Who Would Be King by Rudyard Kipling\n\nJaws by Peter Benchley\n\nLord of the Rings\n\nThe Book Thief by Markus Zusak\n\nTrue Grit by Charles Portis\n\nThe Godfather by Mario Puzo\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest by Ken Kesey\n\nNo Country for Old Men and The Road by Cormac McCarthy\n\nFight Club by Chuck Palahniuk\n\nThe Virgin Suicides by Jeffrey Eugenides\n\nThe Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett, Farewell\n\nMy Lovely and The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque\n\nHarry Potter by JK Rowling\n\nHoles by Louis Sachar\r  \n\r  \n\rMovies that are better than the books:\r  \nPractical Magic by Alice Hoffman\n\nThe Cider House Rules by John Irving\n\nStardust by Neil Gaiman\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada  by Lauren Weisberger\n\nForrest Gump by Winston Groom\n\nThe Princess Bride by William Goldman\n\nP.S.

They didn't muck with the prose and I love that the movie takes entire pages of dialog from the book.\n\nI saw a mural of \"Hunter S. Thompson\" the other day. That's in quotes because... it was actually a painting of Jonny Depp as Hunter S. His performance is so iconic in that movie that I literally think of him first when I think of Hunter S.\n\nI thought the new **Dune** movie was incredible, although I definitely missed the deep political machination going on in the dinner party scene. I was impressed with the restraint on the big fight scenes - I thought we were in for some star wars 30-minute choreography but nope! It was short, brutal, and impactful.\n\nDownvote me for this:\n\n**The Shining** was a great book and a terrible movie adaptation. The movie had a hotel and a lady named Wendy and I'm pretty sure that's where the commonalities stop. It's a good standalone movie, but The Simpsons literally did a closer adaptation.\n\nI have no problem with TV / film changing things that make sense to change. See also the new **IT** movie: Richie Tovar does not use \"gay\" as a pejorative. They upjumped the kids to the 80s, which was smart and respected the source material while changing it for more modern sensibilities. But **The Shining** movie was just a director throwing away the Cliffs notes and winging it.\n\nIt's not a bad movie, but it's a bad adaptation.\n\nBring it on.",

Most books take time to start properly rolling and I just didn't enjoy that beginning part.\n\nIn order to get over this, I first started reading a book that was a series of books (Scott Saunders Space Adventurer, by Patrick Moore), which helped break that. When I had trouble finding a similar set, I started reading novelisations of movies I liked.\n\nIt worked a treat. One of my fave books to read for just 'something to read' is the Aliens novelisation by Alan Dean Foster. I've read that so much I can just open it anywhere.\n\nSo, I don't really have much knowledge in what your broader question is. The reverse of that would be Sphere by Michael Crichton.

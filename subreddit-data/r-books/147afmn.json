    "postText": "SPOILERS: I got through two volumes of this, out of three, and I just can\u2019t finish it. It\u2019s terrible. The good that came out of this is A) the first science fiction, B) the first mad scientist and C) a monster that has inspired hundreds of treatments. It\u2019s the first novel of a precocious 18 yo who desperately needed an editor. She never uses three words when 50 will do just as well. There are two whole chapters in Vol 1 that did nothing to advance the narrative and could have been left out. In the monster\u2019s conversation in Vol 2, there\u2019s most of a chapter telling the life story of some friends of people whose shed he\u2019s using. He lives in said shed for at least a year and nobody ever happens to look into it. Meanwhile this 8\u2019 tall beast is living off \u201cberries and acorns\u201d (FYI acorns are inedible w/o a great deal of processing). The very cinematic creation scene which usually involves lightening and sparks is skipped over in one brief sentence and then the doctor just leaves for two years. I could go on, but I won\u2019t. AN ASIDE: darling Mary took up with Shelley and travelled around Europe for a couple of years until his wife committed suicide because of them, then married him.",

It was an opportunity to demonstrate what that might look like, but it\u2019s just \u201cI created him and then turned and left.\u201d She spent more time describing how overwrought with the vapors he got over the icy Arctic. And if she\u2019s going to take the effort to describe what he ate, it should be believable or it shouldn\u2019t be mentioned.",

I understand if you can't get through the prose but it wasn't a problem in 1800s\n\nThe first two chapters sets up his love and admiration for his family (and his betrothed).  As well as setting the the stage for how he got to college.\n\nAs far as the creation scene goes I think it's one of those things that no one would have published it if it had gone into detail because it would have been a spit towards God. \n\nThe monster learned how to talk in a shed while listening to people read the Bible and paradise lost (1667)  as someone who has read it.  It lines up with the monster pretty well.",

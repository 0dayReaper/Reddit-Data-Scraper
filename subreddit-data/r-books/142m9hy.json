    "postText": "English isn't my first language, and during my teenage years and when I was younger, I didn't understand enough English to be able to read original classic books. We were also poor, so it didn't matter, but last year, I started to read because finally I have time and understanding.\n\nI'm a total beginner and currently I'm going through the top 100. Jane Austen's *Emma* was just chilling in my house (an old gift from someone) so I read that first because it was Slice of life-ish and didn't have many major conflicts. Ended up loving it and proceeded to read all her books. \n\nNow, like I said, I just started reading. Recently, I met a friend who I haven't seen in ages, and somehow the conversation turned to hobbies. I talked about recently picking up reading, and friend's husband eagerly asked me which authors I like to read. Since I haven't read that many, I just said that I recently finished Count of Monte Cristo, All of Jane Austen's books, Jane Eyre, 1984 etc.\n\nHe then kind of started laughing at me and it made me feel very self-conscious and like an idiot. I asked him why he was laughing, and he said that it was just such a generic answer, and that he can't imagine how I can say \"reading is my hobby\" (I didn't say that) if those are the only books I've read. He then asked me if I've ever read Ulysses and told me get recommendations from a different source :(\n\nNow, I'm just left wondering if I'm doing something wrong. I *know* the books I'm reading are perhaps beginner books or whatever but I'm really enjoying it, and I thought I was doing something good for me, only for this guy to laugh at my efforts. Wtf. I'm just wondering, what is actually the answer to such a question? This has honestly made me dead-set on never mentioning reading to anyone ever at all. It was really disheartening. Now, I feel like a \"fake\" reader or something. \n\nI mean, I'm just beginning. What does this guy expect from me? I have to start somewhere :( I can't just join an Olympic race without learning to walk first.",

Your friend picked an insecure loser who makes himself feel superior by putting others down.  \n\nYou've read some very good books and there are so many more worlds in countless books waiting for you to discover them!  \n\nPlease, please don't give that man a second thought.  He knows nothing and those of us who treasure literature would find him sad and pitiful to be so nasty to someone who has just started their reading journey.",

He just sounds ignorant suggesting it.\n\nTruly that person sounds like one of the most insufferable people I can imagine, and probably doesn\u2019t realize that the books you\u2019re reading were favorites of Joyce, who wrote Ulysses. \n\nIn my English degree track, we read classics, but we also read pulpy contemporary stuff. Nowadays I read all kind of stuff depending on what I\u2019m in the mood for. I read Count of Monte Cristo for the first time a few months ago, and now im finishing up a Young Adult series.

Ulysses is heavily based off it, written as a (then) contemporary version. Ulysses is latin for Odyssey.\n\n2. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce. It's a much shorter book and an easier read but gives you context as to what it was like to grow up in Dublin in that era. The lead of thar book, Stephen Dedalus, is also a supporting character in Ulysses so there's a bit of narrative carryover.\n\nOn top of that, keep in mind that it was written explicitly to be challenging, so don't take it too hard if you find it a slog.\n\nAll this is info from an Irishman who never read the book itself, I've just talked to a few people who have.",

But there was a whole new world of books in the high school library and hardly any other students even bothered with them, so I quickly forgot about Animorphs.\n\nThe year I turned thirty (about eight years ago) I suddenly remembered Animorphs.  And now I have a car so I can go to *any* library.  It took two years, but I borrowed and read every single Animorphs in order, as a thirty year old woman.\n\nIt was totally worth the wait.",

You're reading classics that are appropriate for high school and freshman college students.\n\nWhen you consider linguistic drift, those 19th century authors are only getting harder to read, too. For example Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities used to be considered a middle-school or 8th grade book as recently as the 1990s, but now it's considered a 9th-12th grade book. It's not that the book has changed; it's that the English language has drifted away from what's used in the book, making it harder for young people to read.",

It was first translated into Danish in 1949, they did some revisions of this translation, but it was basicly not translated again until 2014, noone wanted to touch the translation, because the first one was quite good, and it is an almost insurmountable task. The newest translation into Danish is from 2019, and has 3.000 explaining notes throughout the book. Oh and it has two translators, one for chapter 1-15 and one for chapter 16-18. It is an immensly difficult book to read.\n\nPeople should read what they like, even if someone believe Stephanie Meyers is the best thing ever, they should read it. Many might think it is elementary and bad writing, but by putting them off, they will never dive deeper. We should all start with easier litterature, that is not deeply dependent on knowing the authors intentions. Ready any classics can never be a mistake, they are classics for a reason, and they have inspired many later books.",

Stream of consciousness writing is a much more interesting concept to read *about* than to actually read. My teacher adored James Joyce, but that book alone spawned in me a fierce dislike for his works.\n\nAlthough years later I learned a bunch of his X-rated letters to his wife were published, and THOSE were entertaining. Let's just say Joyce liked the back door quite a bit. Wish I knew that in high school so I could have thrown the knowledge in my teacher's face, hahaha!\n\nI echo what the other poster said: only a jerk would shame you for reading the works you mentioned. And anecdotally, only a pretentious jerk would cite *Ulysses* as their go-to example of an enjoyable reading experience. It's a slog to get through and says a lot more about that jerk than it does about you not having read it.",

No, Austin isn't the absolute most complex author in the world, but she's also not kiddie material, either.  Even as an adult who has been speaking and reading English for 38 years, I keep a dictionary nearby when I read Austin because I learn all kinds of words I've never seen before.",

I started reading at a very early age (my first grade teacher once phoned my Mom to tell her I was reading the newspaper comic pages during lunch; Mom's reaction was \"What's wrong? Was she supposed to be doing school work?\") and my Dad always encouraged me......by buying me issues of *16 Magazine* (because he knew I loved Herman's Hermits) and *MAD Magazine* (because I enjoyed reading the \"funny papers\"). My teachers weren't thrilled with the 'zine spelling I eventually adapted - \"luv\", \"fave\" and \"pix\" instead of \"love\", \"favorite\" and \"pictures\" - but nevertheless I was still reading (and subconsciously learning new words, etc) in most of my spare time.\n\nI am still a voracious reader, but my preferences are true crime books, celebrity autobiographies/biographies, and Mary Higgins Clark-type mystery novels. No, it's not *Moby Dick* or *Anna Karenina* or *Ulysses*, but it makes me happy and keeps my mind active. Read what you *enjoy*, what makes **you** happy!!",

Dick, and Orson Scott Card to name a few. Some of those authors are a more difficult read, but J.K. Rowling and Leigh Bardugo (The Grisha Trilogy, Six of Crows, Crooked Kingdom, King of Scars) are technically Young Adult authors and the storytelling is written for a younger audience, but as an adult (36) I thoroughly enjoyed their works. I am by no means ashamed of having certain likes and preferences and OP should definitely not feel ashamed by such an elitist asshole trying to belittle them.

And keep in mind this is for native English speakers who\u2019re seeking a career in this domain.\n\nFor my class on \u201ccritical approaches to lit\u201d, we got to vote on a book to read and examine for the semester and I suggested we read Ulysses. It was vetoed by nearly everyone who\u2019d already tried because they all said it was a slog. Its a good book (apparently, I still haven\u2019t finished it and this was over 10 years ago) but any casual reader - especially before the internet age - would probably need to sit with an encyclopedia next to them in order to understand all the classical and religious references made and the wide vocabulary used throughout.\n\nThe person who insulted you was being a narcissistic asshole. He picked a famously difficult book and chastised you for not having read so he would look \u201csmart\u201d for having \u201cgot\u201d it and you \u201cdumb\u201d for never having heard of it. Ignore him, he was trying to look cool.\n\nBooks like 1984 and the Count of Monte Cristo and even Jane Austen are all classics and widely respected books, and many were taught in English college level courses offered at my university. And I\u2019d posit that all of them have had a more obvious influence on western culture than Ulysses because the average readers more likely to have read them. If aliens visiting from another galaxy asked me for a reading list to help them understand western popular culture and the common man over the last 500 years, I\u2019d put the books you\u2019ve already read on that list well before I\u2019d suggest they read Ulysses.",

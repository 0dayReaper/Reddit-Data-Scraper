    "postText": "I just finished reading the four books in the Rama series by Arthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee. The first book (written by Clarke) was a masterpiece. Classic hard sci-fi, one of my favourite genres. Great concept: miscellaneous giant empty space craft enters the solar system 100 years from now, humans make first contact, very mysterious and makes you question your place in the universe. \n\nThe last three books (written by Lee) though? Garbage. Book two is almost entirely political in nature, and not well written. Full of bad analogies and obvious plot points. Books three and four redeem themselves fairly well in terms of direction and writing to the first, but the ending made me want to cave my head in with a rusty pick axe. \n\nThe big plot twist, the reason behind the big alien spacecraft and why it travels the solar system? God did it. It wasn\u2019t even delivered well either. What self-respecting sci-fi author resorts to that? With all due lack of respect, screw Gentry Lee for wasting my time with that hogwash. I\u2019d use more colourful language but I\u2019m trying to be conscious of the rules in this subreddit. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to read any of them, please just stick with the first, Rendevous With Rama. It\u2019s a great standalone short novel.",

If you want to play that kind of game, you have to play War Thunder and they know it. It's a pretty big bummer, because they want you to pay a few hundred a year just to be able to progress at a reasonable rate. That's not including the $70 vehicles and shit they sell. It's sad, the game underneath all the terrible monetization changes they've made over the years is actually good, it's just buried under 100 mechanics designed to frustrate you into paying a shit ton of money. I uninstalled as soon as I heard they were making it even worse, but i understand why some people would try to convince them to change their decision. There's literally no other game to scratch the particular itch that War Thunder does and it blows.",

    "postText": "Okay who else is reading this book by Amy tan!! I just finished the first chapter and it's so good. So let me set the main summary for the 1st chapter bibi the main character is in her 60's and just died we don't know what happens to her yet. Anyway she attends her own funeral as a ghost during the funeral she talks about her passed life and her relationships. Because of how she was treaded as a young kid she decides to shove her feelings down and not feel ever. Until she discovered art and how that's the only way she could express her self.... I'm ready to Definitely keep ready because I can understand how she feels but with music and singing..I also love hiw even though the first chapter opens with a sad beginning that manges to sprinkle some funny parts......have any of yall read her book(I've read the bone setters daughter)",

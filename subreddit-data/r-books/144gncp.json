While I mostly read fantasy, (My Dad got me into Tolkien), I also like a good historical fiction story, or a good murder mystery.  And while I am late to the party, I just found Rachel Hatch books!\n\nI know my parents love of reading helped me to think that reading was cool.\n\nCurious to how many folks here read every day.",

As a tween, I thought I was so cheeky when my parents would tell me it was lights out when I finish my chapter, and I would finish it and then... *gasp* read another chapter!!! \n\nIt's made a lifelong habit that I thoroughly enjoy. I've been reading a book to my son every night before bed since he was about 6 months old, and plan to do the same reading hour routine when he is old enough to read by himself. I love reading, and so does he.",

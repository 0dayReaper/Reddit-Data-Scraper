    "postText": "Dobre doshli readers, \n\nThis is our monthly discussion of the literature of the world!  Twice a month, we'll post a new country for you to recommend literature from, with the caveat that it must have been written by someone from that country (i.e. Shogun by James Clavell is a great book but wouldn't be included in Japanese literature). \n       \nJune 2 was the Day of [Hristo Botev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hristo_Botev); poet, revolutionary, and a national hero of Bulgaria!  To celebrate, please use this thread to discuss your favorite Bulgarian books and authors.\n        \nIf you'd like to read our previous discussions of the literature of the world please visit the [literature of the world](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/literatureof) section of our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/index). \n       \nThank you and enjoy!",

Don't let the title fool you though - it isn't really a hunting story, but a look at a small Bulgarian village in the mid-20th century. In fact, it's not even one story, but five different stories, about different characters, with each connecting with and expanding upon the previous ones.\n\nAnd each has a different feel to it - one's more agrarian, depicting old-time village life, another is more adventurous, and yet another is more \"political\", brutally honest about the forceful collectivization campaign during the early years of communist rule here. That last part was particularly surprising for me, considering the novel was published during the last years of that regime - possibly softer than previous decades, but still strong in its censorship.\n\nIn any case, the novel was released in English several years ago, translated by Angela Rodel. She has also translated several of the other recommendations here, like Angel Igov's A Short Tale of Shame and, of course, Georgi Gospodinov's Time-shelter (which recently won the Booker award), among others.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s so hard to choose just one. But if I have to go then it\u2019s Geo Milev. His is so diverse in his writings. A person with visions of a world that can be a better place, a progressive mind who saw the problems and the oppression of the government and was not afraid to point at them. The oppression and negativity that lies once again century later, unchanged and unfinished.\nHis look on the problems is without the naivety of those who looked at the future and deem it brightly. He shows the grotesque, the beautiful, the innocence, the love and this is all mirrored in his pieces",

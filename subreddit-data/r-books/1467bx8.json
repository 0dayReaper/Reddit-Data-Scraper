    "postText": "I'm fascinated by all things North Korea and this book didn't disappoint. As you can imagine, the boy survived the escape, otherwise we would not have this story published \ud83d\ude02 so no spoilers there\n\nWhat struck me was the speed at which the boy's family went to being high class to being super low class. The dad apparently worked in the military, then did something wrong, and they were all forced out of town. Then he had to leave to find food and never came back. \n\nThen we get to read about the boy's struggle to fend for himself and how he eventually manages to escape to South Korea. It was a description of basic instinct kicking in and it was pretty brutal. They all move by foot. There's violence everywhere, food and medicine are scarce, all kids dropped out of school, etc. \n\nTowards the end he shares a thought that I agree with... The older generation of North Korea (pre Soviet Union collapse) grew up with the idealization of their leaders and this is why they have stayed in power for so long. However, younger generations are living in hardship and (the boy says) they believe the grand stories of their leaders are bull*. So the hope here is that it won't be long before revolution occurs.\n\nI really hope so. This book was very sad and I wish North Korea to be free!",

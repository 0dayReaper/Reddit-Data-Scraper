Monday through Saturday, you wait on your bunk during count and hope so much to be getting a letter as they make their rounds. Then they walk by.  Every single day you don't get something it just hurts.  It hurts inside so much.  The letters from people you thought were your best friends slow down to nothing.  The letters from family slow and slow until it's just mom and grandma writing.  If you ever have the opportunity to safely communicate with a prisoner, do it.  They may not understand at that time what you are doing for their mental state, but take it from me, you are helping them more than even they may know.\n\nI think after the third year, I was fairly used to not getting anything.  The thing that help me though was that I had access to tons of books. I can't write much more because I'm getting that same anxiety feeling in my chest now that I used to get. ",

[The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/?ref=nav) is a great way to say informed but be warned some of those articles will leave you [*incredibly* angry](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/07/06/inside-the-deadly-world-of-private-prisoner-transport) at our \"justice\" system.\n\nExcerpt: (And it gets much, much worse)\n&gt;In July 2012, Steven Galack, the former owner of a home remodeling business, was living in Florida when he was arrested on an out-of-state warrant for failing to pay child support. Galack, 46, had come to the end of a long downward spiral, overcoming a painkiller addiction only to struggle with crippling anxiety. Now, he was to be driven more than a thousand miles to Butler County, Ohio, where his ex-wife and three children lived, to face a judge.This story was produced in collaboration with The New York Times.\n\n&gt;Like dozens of states and countless localities, Butler County outsources the long-distance transport of suspects and fugitives. Galack was loaded into a van run by Prisoner Transportation Services of America, the nation\u2019s largest for-profit extradition company.Crammed around him were 10 other people, both men and women, all handcuffed and shackled at the waist and ankles. They sat tightly packed on seats inside a cage, with no way to lie down to sleep. The air conditioning faltered amid 90-degree heat. Galack soon grew delusional, keeping everyone awake with a barrage of chatter and odd behavior. On the third day, the van stopped in Georgia, and one of two guards onboard gave a directive to the prisoners. \u201cOnly body shots,\u201d one prisoner said she heard the guard say. The others began to stomp on Galack, two prisoners said.The guards said later in depositions that they had first noticed Galack\u2019s slumped, bloodied body more than 70 miles later, in Tennessee. A homicide investigation lasted less than a day, and the van continued on its journey. The cause of death was later found to be undetermined.\n\nEDIT: I figured this might be a good time to share the most affecting story I've ever heard about the injustices of the criminal justice system. It's a ten minute listen called Why The Others Died. [Chuck McDew, chairman of the SNCC, arrested for a sit-in during the Civil Rights movement, describes the fate of a white 10 year old boy imprisoned in the cell next to him.](https://themoth.org/storytellers/chuck-mcdew)\n\nIt's chilling and tragic and terrible and I honestly can't bear to listen to it again, but I'm glad I did. Just hearing the first few lines of the story to get the details straight has me closer to crying than I've been in years...\n\nFuck.",

You can contact the prison to ask for a specific inmate\u2019s address and they will normally release that information to you. \n\nyou could get in contact with other family members or close friends of the inmate to see if they already have the inmate\u2019s address.\nWhen you address the envelope, be sure to write legibly and include all of the required information to ensure your letter is delivered. The address will probably include the inmate\u2019s correctional facility identification number, so you\u2019ll need to include that as well.",

Yes, their kid was dead but the kid had been hit by a random bullet in a driveby.  The person who did it wasn't aiming for the kid.  They weren't trying to kill the child.

If you repeal it (it's debatable whether or not an amendment can be further amended rather than replaced with a different one, as with prohibition), the only legalized framework for slavery is whatever exists at the state and federal level that hasn't been replaced or repealed already.\n\nNobody can magically become a slave just because a law saying they can't be one (or can only be one under this one specific circumstance) is gone; you still need laws saying who can be and how they can become one, which, again, you've just removed. It's already illegal federally to import enslaved people and everyone else enslaved was already freed by the 13th and the emancipation proclamation. You also still have modern trafficking laws on top of that. For example, [Wikipedia notes:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_the_United_States)\n\n&gt;Domestically, human trafficking is a\u00a0federal crime\u00a0under\u00a0Title 18 of the United States Code. Section 1584 makes it a crime to force a person to work against her or his will, or to sell a person into a condition of involuntary servitude.\n\nI get that it's cool to hate on Kanye but he clearly isn't advocating *for* slavery and what he is advocating for wouldn't actually result in anyone being enslaved just because. The only way it translates to slavery returning is if someone explicitly passes a law that otherwise would have been challenged or overturned on the basis of the 13th, and it *still* has to be viable in the context of other federal laws about trafficking, kidnapping, extortion, coercion, etc.",

If you were eligible to work, and did, you made 2 bucks a day in the facility or 10 bucks a day doing fire suppression work during fire season. Keep in mind that you had to meet very strict criteria to be eligible for either of these programs. To the point where I think we had around 500 inmates and only about 15 getting paid in the facility. \n\nAnd everything cost more. Like someone above said, 2 bucks for a coke. Oh and if your family wanted to put money into your account, the company that ran the account took a percentage. So if you wanted to put 100 into their account, you had to pay 115 if I remember right. \n\nThe prison industry has nothing to do with keeping society safe or with rehabilitation. Its a money grab. Heck, if we didn't keep you and you were only in for a citation for DUI etc, we charged you like 50 bucks for all the paperwork. ",

It's focused solely on the punitive punishment of removing deviant individuals from society\n\n**Rehabilitation** Focuses on re-entering the individual into society.  Usually used against young offenders or drug based offences\n\n**Restitution** Is the courts effort to get an individual to make amends for what they've done.  Sometimes financially, sometimes via community service\n\nI think it goes without saying that incarceration is the most popular on average but has proven to be the least effective overall.

Been hearing about things like this for years, and yet it still pervades. Prison for profit must be one of the most horrific &amp; unjust concepts, I truly cannot understand how it's so accepted.\n\nEdit: I hadn't drawn the comparison when I first commented, but the state &amp; church's treatment of unwed mothers in Ireland was also prison for profit, and was accepted for a very long time, even by the families of those poor women &amp; children. Thankfully it's no longer in practice, and would never be tolerated again, but I cannot get my head around how fine people used to be with it. Fear of the church seems to be the common opinion, but that still can't explain it.",

You can toss all of the \"But they committed the crime, so they deserve what they get\" nonsense at me all you want and that just makes you sound like an uneducated tool.  The entire penal system is designed to suck profits out of prisoners and keep there there as long as possible.  They want you in prison so the laws are tailored to target very specific economic classes and then while you are there, they want to to keep you uneducated, under fed, under nourished so that you will end up back in their system.  The penal system should be about rehabilitation, not exploitation.  A place where people do their time but at the same time regain their humanity so that when they get out, they can reenter society and function in it and live a normal life.\n\nThere are probably institutions out there in the US that do this, but they are few and far between.\n\nAlso... I understand that there are inmates who have done terrible, terrible things.  They themselves have the right to do their time and try and regain their humanity.

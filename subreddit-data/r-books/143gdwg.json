Does the book reflect the beliefs about hell at the time? I know the work was produced as a piece of fiction but I was wondering if it was an actual commonly held belief that greek monsters resided in the depths of hell or if that was just an artistic mixing that none would take literally.",

There are plenty of classic biblical ideas about sins, punishment, judgement etc that have been foundational to the catholic church since it\u2019s inception.\n\nHowever, Dante was also obsessed with Greco-Roman writers of antiquity i.e. Ovid, and Virgil (no wonder Virgil shows up in the book!). These influences, and a very active imagination create the foundation of the inferno.",

Everything about Hell, Purgatory and Heaven is made up by him. Note how he puts Beatrice, the woman he loved and that died when she was only 24, in Heaven. While Virgilio represents the reason, Beatrice (who was pure in his eyes) represents theology itself, faith. \n\nTo note also that the whole Divine Comedy is written around the symbolism of the number 3. \nit has 3 main section : Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. \nInferno(Hell), has 3 types of sin : Sin committed without following one\u2019s reason, Sin of violence, and Sin committed following one\u2019s reason (fraudulence) . \n\nHell itself has 9 circles, each of those circles is divided in 3 sections. Each section reminds each of the 3 types of sin. \n\nEach section is characterised by the presence of 3 main infernal rivers: Archeronte, Stige and Cocito. \n\nSources wise, Dante uses the Bible, Classic mythology, Theology of Scholasticism, Giovanni\u2019s Apocalypse, various Medieval sources such as les chansons de geste. \n\nIf you can, read the Divine Comedy together with a text that explains everything in detail, as it is not generally a book meant to be read without properly understanding or knowing the context and its structure. You would get a lot more out of it as well.",

Or can you read in the original Italian from the 1300s?",

But we do so with notes, explanations, and the teacher helping us understand everything. \n\nIt really does depend on the teacher, but mine was a big fan of the Divine Comedy and we studied it for the whole year. Our book was a \u201csimplified\u201d one, meaning each paragraph contained the explanation and content of what was said. I still remember some of the quotes by heart, 15 or so years later. My favourite has always been Canto V.\n\nEdit: Dante is also considered the father of the Italian language. He set a precedent by writing his book in the Italian dialect of Florence, in a time where everything was written in Latin, which then later became the official language of Italy. For this reason, the language used in his book it is still quite similar to the one we speak today, and fun fact - because of this, Florence is the only region in Italy who doesn\u2019t have a dialect, since the Italian is an evolution of their regional dialect.",

It\u2019s kind of like reading Shakespeare. You can get the meaning, even with some of the weird words, phrases, and orthography. You can understand it deeper with annotations. \n\nItalian as a language has changed much less than English has, so 14th-c Italian is legible to anyone who knows Italian, which is not true for English.",

You can have other personal beliefs about Hell, but there's not much else that the Church teaches definitely. \n\nAs for what most Catholics believe, well, both then and now, Catholics cover a wide swath of the population, with both sophisticated theologians and average joes and everything in between. Consequently, you will get a wide variety of beliefs about Hell. A lot of modern Christians' conceptions about Hell are actually based on Dante's Inferno, Milton's Paradise Lost, and the painting of Hieronymus Bosch. Personally, I follow St. Gregory of Nyssa's belief that \"heaven and hell are not about location, but about relationship. God is everywhere ...  If we love God, His fire will be a comforting warmth, but if we choose not to have a relationship with Him, His fire will be as hell fire.\" ([source](https://gretchenjoanna.com/tag/st-gregory-of-nyssa/))\n\nAt present, there is not a lot of emphasis within Roman Catholic Christianity about Hell; for example, it's only rarely brought up in sermons or talks. The \"burning in hellfire\" message seems to be more heavily emphasized in evangelical Protestant circles.",

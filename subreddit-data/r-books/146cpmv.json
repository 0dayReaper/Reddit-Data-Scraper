    "postText": "Everett\u2019s engaging and eminently readable account of Cicero and his times is full of details normally lost to history.  Thanks to  a huge amount of surviving letters to and from friends and politicians we get a picture of Cicero the man, the husband, the father, the lawyer and the politician.\n\n\u201cCicero was always prone to excessive mood swings.  He easily became overconfident when his affairs went well and a setback could drive him into an exaggerated depression.\u201d\n\n\tHe had his strong suits and his weaknesses and one of the best things about this book is that, while Everett gives his own fairly pro-Cicero opinions, he also provides plenty of information for you to disagree with him. \n\n          Cicero was a prideful man often ridiculed.  No stranger to jabs himself, Cicero comes across as that uncle who can make you laugh with his first joke and leaves you cringing the rest of the night as he searches for more attention.  His split from his wife, even if justified, was cold but had many admirable qualities and his love for his daughter was undeniable.  In his grief, his way of coping was to produce his most philosophical work.   \n\n\u201cI cannot easily say how useful I shall be to others: in any case, for my terrible sorrows and all the various troubles that assail me on every side no other consolation could be found.\u201d\n\n\tWhat sets Cicero apart, a picture Everett paints so well, is his commitment to oratory.  \n\n\u201cA familiar Ciceronian theme reappears: the moral force of oratory.  An important means of fostering virtue is through the art of explanation and persuasion \u2014the \u2018science of distinguishing the true from the false [and] publish to fellow citizens precepts conducive to their well-being and credit, so designed to win their acceptance.\u2019  This is necessary, for it is abundantly clear to Cicero that actual legislation of states is not necessarily consistent with natural law. \u2018The most foolish notion of all is the belief that everything is just which is found in the customs or laws of nations.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe events in the book focus on Cicero (Cicero is smiling from the grave) which may put him more in the spotlight than he truly was (end of smile) but Everett\u2019s Cicero is more than just a biography, it is also a masterful account of his times.  There are too many events to list here but for anyone looking for an account of the fall of the republic that is both detailed and comprehensible I think this serves nicely.  Of course, your mileage may vary as this is packed full of information. For reference, I have read about 10 books that cover or run through this period, including some of the source material.\n\n\tIn the end Cicero fought to save the republic by unconstitutional means.  And he oh so nearly pulled it off.  That failure was his end, Mark Antony would have no mercy on the 63 year old Cicero.  Living in the age of the fall of the republic, as ever, Cicero was given no relief.  \n\n\u201cI am stopping here.  Come here, soldier.  There is nothing proper about what you are doing, but at least make sure you cut off my head properly.\u201d\n\n\tCicero died on a hidden path to the sea.  Nevertheless, Cicero is immortal.  He lives on through his writings, which have influenced societies for over two-thousand years.  For anyone interested in Cicero and his times I would certainly recommend this book.      \n\n4.8 stars",

    "postText": "I don\u2019t think this is a particularly hot or relevant take, but I think The Crucible may be one of the most overpraised literary works of the 20th Century. People (or maybe just my high school lit teacher\u2026) are always drooling and fluttering their eyelashes at the use of allegory, and sure it was controversial at the time it was produced for speaking out against McCarthyism. However, I think it fails both to seriously indict its historical context and as a story.\n\nFirst let me history nerd a bit: the Salem Witch Trials and what may have caused them are fascinating subjects of historical research and conjecture. Theories include everything from psycho-active rotted wheat stores to the ultimate expression of a patriarchal society\u2019s destruction of its most vulnerable members to the idea that groups of young women sought to gain political power in a social order that subjugated them completely. \n\nWhat does Arthur Miller imagine was the root cause of such a famously cryptic historical event? A jealous teenager wants to continue to bang his self-insert character at seemingly any cost. John Proctor, of course, is not truly at fault for sleeping with his young employee. Even when he finally apologizes to his wife, she assures him it\u2019s really her fault because she \u201ckept a cold home\u201d. Proctor is a man martyred not by single-minded societal pressure committed to political homogeneity as allegory lovers might suggest, but by the whims of a silly girl who just couldn\u2019t control herself. \n\nAnyway, excuse my random rant\u2026I\u2019ve been raging at this one for years.",

            "comment": "What an utterly bizarre take. In my interpretation of it, Miller was more using the witch trials as a basis, (a loose one without strict historical adherence, at that) or otherwise as a vehicle to commentate on the realities of the 1950s and the governmental oppression enacted on suspected Communists within the United States, and specifically within Hollywood and theater writers. **In other words, he was using it as a vehicle to address the dangers of using sanctioned mob justice enacted on* what amounts to petty spats at the least and at worst blacklisting and long-term ruination of careers.**\n\nNot to mention, I'd say outside of McCarthyism, [the chilling effect that the media has, coinciding with vile actions by people with a bone to pick can do as much damage. It was almost the perfect storm of Bambina Maude Delmont and District Attorney Brady that brought near total ruination of Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_Arbuckle#Scandal) What I'm saying at the end of it all is, The Crucible was more of a period piece commenting on the issues of the Red Scare of the 1950s than it was on the Witch Trials of the 1690s.\n\nBesides of which, Proctor, while being the penultimate 'fall guy' of all the victims of injustice within the story, ought to be remembered for his line,\n\n&gt; \u201cBecause it is my name! Because I cannot have another in my life! Because I lie and sign myself to lies! Because I am not worth the dust on the feet of them that hang! How may I live without my name? I have given you my soul; leave me my name!\u201d \n\nHis line is one spoken for the people who had to give up their personhood* in society, discarded through the mobs fueled by the fear and hatred of the Red Scare, specifically thanks to Joseph McCarthy's witch hunts in particular. **Proctor didn't want to tarnish his name for being accused of something he absolutely wasn't, a witch, and in turn Miller, in not being a Communist.**",

You are right that Miller was attempting to allegorically criticize McCarthyism, but the Abigail character is where that allegory fails and the story bleeds into the territory I am criticizing. McCarthy and men of his ilk were using their position of power to bully, harass, and exclude from public life those who didn\u2019t agree with them. The central accuser of \u201cwitches\u201d in The Crucible, however, is a young woman acting out of petty jealousy. The deflection from directly criticizing men in power to young women (one of societies most frequent punching bags) is what sours me on the story as a whole.",

I think what I've been struggling with in this post was my personal sentiment that the argument about blaming women to be dismissive of the overarching commentary that I proposed, being a criticism of McCarthyism. Abigail and the female accusers, and even by extension the men who played by the whims of the female accusers all have blood on their hands, but to solely criticize *The Crucible* for leaning too heavily on\n\n&gt; how the story squares it\u2019s blame for mob violence and mentality on women\n\nis perhaps missing the forest for the trees. It was the wider systemic effort by not just Abigail, but by Samuel Parris and by extension the patriarchal judiciary doing what they thought was 'right' rather than what was reasonable for leading to many unnecessary deaths and violence, a lot of which were against women during the Witch Trials. \n\nI suppose at the end of it all what I want to say is, yes, Abigail's misdeeds and her characterization are, bad, especially upon closer inspection, but I cannot fathom to say that the moral high ground assumed by the \"courts\" (in the play) or by McCarthy and co. aren't also worthy of criticism, and in fact, can be a vector of critique rather than as you say, being deflected from the story in itself.",

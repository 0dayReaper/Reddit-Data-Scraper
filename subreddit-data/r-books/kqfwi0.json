It does a better job capturing the character conflict of Long John, of him both liking Jim and trying to be loyal to his men.\n\nHonestly both of them were great. You're splitting hairs.",

The characters are all horrific people: an alcoholic pasty partying a few years in exchange for letting the mob pin their crimes on him and some old money assholes who've never worked a day in their lives and flee town after killing a young woman in a hit and run DUI. There's basically no one for the Muppets to play, unless they all want to be villians.\n\nI can only imagine Fitzgerald's horror that America ignored his brilliant criticism on wealth and think the Great Gatsby is a love story with glamorous parties (even in the book there're suppose to be trashy careless events causing multiple DUI accidents).",

There's basically no one for the Muppets to play, unless they all want to be villians.\n\nI can only imagine Fitzgerald's horror that America ignored his brilliant critics on wealth and think the Great Gatsby is a love story with glamorous parties (even in the book there're suppose to be trashy,  careless events causing multiple DUI accidents).",

Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s narrative. It is, like others have said, a dark and cynical story at its core, with the glitz and glamour of the Roaring 20s merely a vehicle for the chaos. \n\nUs anime fans took one lesson from our childhood- don\u2019t fuck with somebody\u2019s creative vision to sell toys and cereal. Don\u2019t do that to The Great Gatsby. Keep some things sacred.",

It's like the people clamoring for this only remember the \"glamorous\" parts of the Leo movie or something, and have never actually taken the time to either read the book or pick apart the larger themes of the most recent movie version. The book is dark as hell and ends with a murder. This is not Muppet material in the least, and in order to make it for kids would have to gloss over most if not all the lessons the story is supposed to teach.",

There's also the infidelity aspect on Daisy's end. None of the characters are ultimately heroic or virtuous. What would people want to see in a Muppet version of the Great Gatsby?\n\nTo be clear on my opinion of The Great Gatsby, this is a classic novel that I happen to love, but Muppet fodder it is not.\n\nWhere is the family Muppet-esque message and story here that kids would be interested in, and that Disney would be interested in telling? Do people not realize there's no joy in this story, there's just warnings of the dangers of obsession, capitalistic excess, jealousy, and not being able to move on?",

A major part of the central conflict of the story is Tom having an affair with Myrtle Wilson, which ends in Myrtle's death by car and Gatsby's murder by shooting. Would they show that in muppet form? Or remove these parts of the story? And what would be left?\n\nI love the muppets but this seems like a weird pairing. Not sure why Reddit is so into the idea. I think Reddit just likes the idea of a Muppets movie set in the twenties with jazz music and flappers and art deco.",

Can't question this, have to be in favor of that, but unable to really explain why.\n\nFear is why. Why would you be afraid of holding an unpopular opinion, if it's what you've thought through and believe? Because other people have been hurt for not simply accepting a prevailing opinion without argument. \n\nIt's just strange to me. I'm not averse to change, but I won't change my view on something because others say I should. I'll think it over. When did that become wrong?",

Long running \"hippie\" festival, they had a \"tolerance zone\" or something like that. A \"space for all non-traditional genders and sexualities to gather and discuss and share in tolerance.\" But with the very specific caveat \"two-spirit identities will *not* be tolerated\".\n\nSame festival, a friend of mine sells his art, which sometimes contains PNW native motifs. He's gotten shit for it because he is white and blonde. To the point that he tries to go out of his way not to incorporate any of it anymore. His grandfather lived in a longhouse in BC. Is he supposed to hang up his ancestry.com results like a liquor license to sell his art?",

For example, have you ever tried to find data about France's muslim minority? It's fuckin hard. But, idk, it feels like it would be useful to know what's happening with their youth unemployment rate... When the data we *do* have from a decade ago shows it was at disgustingly high rates (40%+ (see [here](https://www.economist.com/europe/2013/02/23/forgotten-in-the-banlieues),  but this is not the study I'm thinking of that showed it nationwide among muslim youths, which I'm having trouble finding)) due in large part to [discrimination](https://archive.is/239A2).\n\nThe truth is that a huge number of countries have similar, though obviously different, problems to the U.S.. Closing your eyes to those problems is not a way to fix them. For reference, the U.S. has monthly &amp; quarterly stats of the unemployment rate among our various subgroups. Muslims in the U.S. are actually employed at similar rates to the general population, so our most comparable subgroup would be young african americans - who have an [unemployment rate of ~14%](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm).",

Yes they have other ethnicities, but they are still mostly homogenous. Other countries are like wow its so weird in the US with all this talk, but they don't have the same dynamic of a melting pot like the US does. \n\nWe talk about race because as others have pointed out its to make sure no one gets overlooked. In more homogenous countries that tends to happen. \n\nOther countries pretend they don't have an issue, because they have smaller minority populations. But there's definitely a lot of hidden racism.",

As a result, a movement that began as a call for more authentic stories about marginalised communities \u201cgets flipped around and weaponised against the marginalised writers to pigeonhole them into telling only certain kinds of stories\u201d.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The issue is addressed in Kuang\u2019s recent novel, Yellowface, in which a white writer claims a dead Chinese friend\u2019s manuscript as her own. When the book, about Chinese farm workers who supported Britain in the first world war, becomes a huge success it sparks a debate about the supposed author\u2019s right to tell the story.\n\nThis does sound like an interesting setting to bring up. I can easily imagine that in a scenario like that, the dumb online conversation would be entirely lost between \"she is bad because white people shouldn't write about these issues\", and the equally dumb  \"she did nothing wrong because anyone can write about anything they want to\", and overlooking the nuances of the situation, while at the same time the nuanced understanding is still that yes, there is still an underlying racial problem with the publishing industry that incentivizes that kind of conflict.",

She is the epitome of an unreliable narrator. She tells us things in a way that make it sounds better for her, but in reality, she\u2019s behaving much worse than what she makes us believe. \n\n\n(Hopeful the spoiler tag works: ) \n\n&gt;!For a start, she claims she was not friend with Athena, when clearly they were friends, at least that\u2019s what Athena thought of them. June was too jealous and bitter because her friend was more successful than her. She constantly makes excuses for her behaviour, twisting things to make herself look better. Athena dies and she steals the manuscript, and she edits it in a way that\u2019s questionable at best. She refuses any sort of criticism and she constantly belittle chinese people, their food, their English, their culture, and doesn\u2019t even know the difference between Korean and Chinese. The issue here is not that she wrote about another race - it\u2019s the fact that she not only stole Athena\u2019s manuscript, but she changes it in a way that\u2019s incredibly ignorant and disrespectful. She can\u2019t even be bothered to understand naming conventions. She clearly thinks she\u2019s above them all. She talks about oppression without knowing anything about it and then tries to make the reader feel sympathy for the oppressors. It would be the same effect if a rich person where to write about homelessness just for clouts, without even trying to understand, empathise, and ultimately telling us that the homeless are homeless because they\u2019re lazy.!&lt; \n\nEdit: typos",

Because you can think this is a \u201cwhite people bad\u201d fact, but its true for all human beings, anyone can be an advocate for others under safe-ish conditions. Here in Canada we have an awful history of how natives got and get treated. I have friends who are really passionate advocates for their protections and doing right by them. Not a single one of those friends would give up their homes or daily comforts to return stolen land though, if it came down to it. This does not make them bad people, it just makes them human beings who do need to look out for their own well being first. I just enjoy pointing out their hypocrisy when they start letting what a good \u201cally\u201d they are get to their own heads and begin to feed their ego.",

By the exact same logic no man should be allowed to write from the perspective of a woman. Writing itself is basically an act of appropriation, it has to be or else every single novel ever would be an autobiography. You are always inhabiting other perspectives. \n\nYes, it can be done horribly and has been horribly many times, but that doesn't mean it's wrong in principle. It just means its hard. But that's obvious, really, it's always hard writing from a wildly different perspective and the ability to do so respectfully is one of the marks of a good writer. If a writer does it poorly they should be criticized, but they should not be criticized on the principle of it. \n\nI find it concerning how discussions of the segregation of art are becoming more common, regardless. It seems racial essentialism is on the rise as a common ideology, but modern racial groups are social constructs. They exist via consequences of how that construction has shaped society, but by completely segregating perspective based on those constructs all you do is serve to forever enshrine them. I think it's an anti-progressive mindset that has unfortunately become default for many of my fellow progressives.",

That's the most important thing about them. The diversity that's being pushed these days is quite literally skin deep.

In the book neither the white or racial character are presented as 'good', and writing other peoples stories as the token minority author, for bad reasons, is attacked nearly as much as the character pretending to be another race for bad reasons. \n\nI'm not sure if it was the same interview rebroadcast by CBC, but every answer sounded like they'd given her a month to prepare an answer, when she was just giving off the cuff responses, on the phone, while apparently also doing her laundry.",

So nowadays people are keen to give up on the project of diverse society, something which was never going to be easy. \n\nIn the US for example, black nationalism has seen a notable increase in recent years.

Why do people talk about race? Because people are racist and some of those people actively try to commit harm to others who don't look like they do. Those people are \"others\" and once you feel that way, it becomes incredibly easy to start blaming them for all your problems.\n\nThe US has an abhorrent history of racism and you know, the whole slavery thing, and one way we have improved things was to talk  openly about it. We still talk about it because improving does not mean the problem was solved. Hell, we are currently on a backslide with racist and misogynist laws being enacted. We absolutely _must_ keep talking about it. \n\nThe argument that racism is a construct... so? None of that matters to the person getting dragged behind a pickup truck because their skin was too dark. Racism is a _human_ problem, worldwide. The EU liked to think it didn't have a racism problem until migrants started flooding across the border. Then the \"I'm not racist _but_\" people will start having microphones shoved in their face and some of their real opinions will start spilling out. \n\nFinally you should probably tell us what mysterious place you come from where people don't notice differences in other people. I'm sure you chose not to because it wouldn't take much digging to find that no, it isn't some racism free miracle of humanity, you are just viewing things like everyone else does before changes start actually affecting them. Racism is _always_ in the background. Most people are decent enough to keep their opinions to themselves and hell may not even realize they hold those opinions because they have never been confronted by a situation where they could come out.\n\nOnce you start having a population change of significance, and times get tougher, racism comes out. It is always easier to blame someone else for your problems than it is to look inward and take responsibility for your situation.",

You realize how obvious what you just said is, right? Of course a country with no/much less racial diversity doesn't have as many conversations about race, they're irrelevant there. Those countries are typically far more racist, there's just far fewer minorities that have to deal with that racism. And obviously a country with a ton of different races will and should talk about issues of race more often in order to avoid said racism. \n\nTalking about it is a good thing, I don't understand why Europeans and others always try to act like talking about these issues is a bad thing for America. Almost the entire rest of the world isn't \"beyond talking about race,\" they haven't even reached that point yet to where they are talking about it in a meaningful manner.

But they are using it as a sweeping brush for all their books. What does being gay have to do with painting dragons for a fantasy cover. I'm sorry, but what. \n\nIt should really come down to style and what vibes most with the authors work. The most important to me is that my work speaks to the author on a personal level. There's something magical about connecting art to the right book. \n\nThe other thing is... Like how connected to their culture are they. You are assuming that based on their face or name they are like grounded in their roots. I am the first born American in my family and if you asked me to illustrate a book about my family's \"native country\" I don't feel like I am any better qualified than anyone else.

This author has the exact opposite position the title implies, and the title implies the problem is completely different than what is discussed.\n\nNo one is telling authors what they can and can't write.  And there are still tons of white male authors being picked up by publishers.\n\nThe issue has always been that there are so many more non-BIPOC authors picked up than anyone else that the majority of stories in the public consciousness about BIPOC came from white male authors -- which IS a problem.\n\nGen Z is choosing to get stories from people of other backgrounds.  This is good and fine - People have the right to choose what they read as well.  Publishers are choosing to cater to that.  And also responding to upset from their customers about untasteful portrayals by adding reader feedback from people from those communities to the editing process.\n\nNo one is telling anyone what to write.  But as has always been true, people are selective about what they want to read and accept as genuine.  Publishers are responding to that.  Publishing has always  influenced what gets written and by who --  and this is actually an improvement of that problem, being framed as the opposite.  It is very 2023.",

I am mostly reading translated Japanese fantasy books these days, and they tend to get ignored by anyone who is not already a manga or anime fan.  And the rest is made of new fantasy books by older \"white\" authors that I already like, and who get ignored by anyone who is not already a fan of those authors. So I could not care less about what the authors of the books I read look like, only about how good their books are. \n\nAnd since I know that the books whose authors I like are never going to get any attention on social media, no matter what the \"race\" of their authors actually is, it makes that kind of debate and \"whining for attention\" feels very shallow, especially when coming from authors that are already very popular on social media.",

A Pulitzer Prize winner like 'Orphan Masters Son' set in mid 90s North Korea, couldn't even exist. Nor essentially any historical novel set anywhere over 90 years ago, or featuring groups and languages that have died out entirely (like the Romans or Greeks)",

Should women never write men? Should fantasy and scifi writers avoid writing about elves and space elves because we don't know how it can affect future generations of elves and how they might be culturally portrayed?\n\nNot going to lie, when I read a book about a family or person of another ethnicity, and the whole book is 99% characters of that ethnicity and the only white people in it are racists or antagonists... I mean it hurts. It's not a charming image of my people, and I think what it represents is damaging and going to contribute to fueling a deeper divide.\n\nIt hurts seeing the industry champion this behavior and it hurts seeing people get snubbed over the alternative.\n\ninb4: \"BUT I KNOW LOTS OF RACIST WHITE PEOPLE AND THEY SHOULD BE PORTRAYED AS SUCH, AND YOU ARE RACIST FOR NOT BEING AS IRRATIONALLY ANGRY AS I AM AT PERCEIVED RACISM\"",

As more and more people buy their books online, we wanted to create an easy, convenient way for you to get your books and support bookstores at the same time. If you want to find a specific local bookstore to support,\u00a0find them on our map\u00a0and they\u2019ll receive the full profit off your order. Otherwise, your order will contribute to an earnings pool that will be evenly distributed among independent bookstores (even those that don\u2019t use Bookshop).\n\n**Edit:** I didn't expect this to get the amount of attention that it did. Bookshop launched earlier this year and it has actually helped quite a few of my local bookstores stay afloat during the shelter-in-place order and subsequent restrictions. \n\nThere are a lot of questions about how the site actually works and the answers can be found on https://bookshop.org/pages/about. \n\nFrom what I read, Bookshop has been working very closely with the American Booksellers Association in their endeavor to help independent bookstores.",

That's why companies like amazon thrive - easy and cheap, at a large ever-growing scale.\n\nFor those of us who can afford to we can make the choice to do as much shopping as we can locally or from small stores, even online, but the cost isn't just money it's time. People with less of either of those than even I have, I can definitely understand not being able to swing it. Shit I've had plenty of instances of needing something and the ease of an Amazon or even a target wins over finding somewhere else that sells it and then waiting for it. Especially when like you said, it's something small that's twice the price elsewhere.\n\nI honestly think the only thing that will help is more antitrust regulation, at least to break up large companies like amazon so they don't win out on everything because they're literally controlling dozens (at least) of almost entire supply chains.",

The idea that, as a business, one can afford to be closed a few days a year isn\u2019t wrong, but not all days are equal days. The very holidays that as a business owner you\u2019d like to be off to enjoy with your family, are likely also to be your most profitable days of the year.",

Make a shit load (relatively speaking anyway) and the close up at the end of the first week of the new year.\n\nI\u2019m semi-retired, so it makes the rest of the year relatively free for me to do whatever I like. Once I fully retire, I\u2019m probably just going to close that shop permanently and sell the space.\n\nI also used to run the business during the summer (as we\u2019re a bit of a tourist town) and so I had it open only during the summer and the Holidays. But now I want my summers off and the money makes sense to only have it open during the Holidays.\n\nSmall and local businesses really only make sense if they provide services, like barber shops, hair stylists, cafes, restaurants, that sort of thing. Goods, on the other hand, have no place in a small business any more unless it is a really niche market.\n\nAs it is, my business sells goods and people are really only going to buy from my business increasingly during the Holidays I\u2019ve found in the last 10 years or so. It\u2019s lucky that I\u2019m on my way out of working and have made a comfortable living with a good amount of savings for the rest of my life.

Most people spend time in a book store, browsing, and then leave without buying anything.\n\nI've noticed in many European cities, bookstores have changed into book-cafes and book-bars, where you buy a drink, and spend time reading books, and they make real profit. There are Japanese equivalents like Manga-Cafes.\n\nHere in the US, I've heard most bookstores are \"privately subsidized\" - meaning they are hobby of either retired couples, or run by people, whose partners/spouses have independent income to support their hobby.\n\nIn other words, they aren't present to make money.\n\nAlso, in pre-internet-delivery and pre-ebook era, most bookstores made money through pre-orders. Their bulk money didn't come from selling books displayed on the shelf, they functioned as channel and distribution centers. This model doesn't work today, and bookstores are just whimsical reminders of the past, unless they change their business model.",

I tried going at different times in the day. Some days I tried to go on my way back from work. I could never seem to get there when they were open.

The only chance bookstores had was if publishers required online prices to be the same as in store.

Even still, the huge difference in expenses means online is vastly more profitable.  The only thing book stores have going for them is the ability to see the product in person.

An independent bookstore, even if not brick and mortar, has to make normal margins to stay afloat. \n\nThe fact Amazon can cover many of its overheads with other areas of the business is not a criticism we should put at the doorstep of independent business owners. We need to find a way for small businesses to breathe, that benefits us, them and the market as a whole. \n\nYou could argue that the stores should close and the reigns should be handed over to Amazon, but that is not a good thing for the future of books.

If Amazon buys 20 pallets of Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, and the local bookshop only buys 20 copies, I'd expect Amazon to have a better price on Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett.\n\nI think the issue local bookstores are facing is definitely one of price, and unless they find creative ways to cut costs and drop their prices, they'll keep fading away. I was a heavy reader for years and the only way I could sustain it was by frequenting the library, used book stores (where books are 4-10 dollars, as opposed to 10-20 dollars), or, if those options failed me, ordering on Amazon. The used book store model does still seem quite viable as I've seen a couple new ones open up in my home town.\n\nI should also point out: Many smaller bookshops shifted to selling through amazon as third party sellers. I'm not sure what that says about the industry, or whether it's good or bad for their businesses overall, but it's definitely a thing.",

Because its so much cheaper, I'll always check there first for what I'm looking for, but it's horribly disorganized (I'm talking rows of books behind rows of books on the shelves, neither one with any rhyme or reason) and the staff is super unhelpful since they don't know where anything is either. If I go to Barnes and Noble, I know the book is in stock because I confirmed online before I even left the house, the book is exactly where I expect it to be, and I'm in and out in 10 minutes. It's more convenient, even if I am paying sometimes double the price than the used book shop.\n\nThis is all pretty much moot though since I'll normally just get the book I want from my local library. It's part of a system of probably 2 dozen or so library branches in the county and I can request any book in the system to be picked up at my local branch for a quarter.",

They don\u2019t make enough money to pay a livable wage to all employees. Some don\u2019t even make enough profit to pay the damn owner a decent wage reliably. Yet that\u2019s their importance! In small businesses we see owners struggling to survive! Owners that are more likely to be our friends than fucking Bezos. So when they say \u201cyeah, if they raise the minimum wage I go out of business\u201d we believe them. And if we\u2019re decently paid middle class workers we don\u2019t have a big stake in the argument so we vote for the guy that will help our friend by not raising wages.\n\nThat\u2019s. The role of small business in our current society. To serve as the small puppy that justifies the law that let all the big fat cats fuck us all in the ass *including* small business owners.\n\nSo nah, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to support local business. Not when it\u2019s more expensive, less comfortable and brings zero novelty. I\u2019ll go to a local restaurant with good food and I\u2019ll go to a local fun novelty business.

Dalton, and even Tower Books; they were the place that had anything I could think of with knowledgable staff. As I grew older, some local bookstores started to pop up as Walden/Tower/B.Dalton closed down, leaving just a lone Barnes but these local bookstores weren't enjoyable. Like yours, they were staffed with a single elderly person that just sat at the front, constantly watching as I tried to navigate the narrow isles full of unorganized books that were two or three times what I saw them for at Barnes or Amazon. \n\nI love my small town but I'm not going to spend money on local just to support local; I'm not made of money. If I have ten dollars to buy dinner out and a local burger joint wants $8.99 for a basic burger without anything while I can go to a place like Red Robin burger and get a burger with fries for that same $8.99, that's where I'm going. \n\nIndustries raise and fall based on technology and ease. The same people shouting to support local bookstores, are they also only uses local mechanics? Are they only shopping at local hardware stores? Only go to local computer companies? Do they shout that people need to buy from the local clothing stores? Unlikely because the price and selection are better from bigger stores.",

I really would, but sometimes the price difference is astonishing.\n\nTLDR: It is so hard when the book is double the cost locally and means you then cannot get a loved one the christmas gift you planned on if you buy it there.\n\nI love reading, as does my entire family and I had some ideas for books my wife wanted.\n\nTwo days ago I check Amazon and see the book I chose there for $40 after tax with free shipping. I want to support local though, so with a list in mind for other christmas presents I can make work in our budget this year I head out. I have several ideas and carefully plan out her gift and little stocking ideas to come in just under budget. I love doing this, gifting is one of my biggest love languages and I do everything I can to make sure I show my wife and kids I love them in my carefully chosen gifts.\n\nI get to the local stores and pick up some small things, then get to the books. Same book, same edition, same cover. Perfect right? Well it is $66.99 before tax. Let's assume tax nicely rounds that up to $70... That is a $30 difference. I was expecting maybe $10-$15 and had decided to bite the bullet for that since I know my wife would appreciate me shopping local, but $30? That is a huge difference and literally means I now need to choose.\n\nSo do I pay $40 for the book on Amazon and get my wife and kids the gifts I had carefully planned plus a couple of extra little things using the $10 I had assumed I would pay extra for shopping local? Or do I drop $70 to shop local and have to scratch off at least one item from my list and get one of my family somthing else that is much cheaper? \n\nFor the moment I havent bought either since I know my wife would love it to be bought locally. My next day off work I plan to go to every local bookstore and check prices since I have been warned that local prices vary wildly where I live.\n\nps.For those who will undoubtedly post to say \"It is only $30! Get over it!\". Yeh it is $30 dollars, I am super happy you don't care about budgets and waste your money without caring about paying nearly double for things but some of us have tight budgets this year with the whole worldwide pandemic going on and $30 more for a book is ALOT. If $30 means so little that you wouldn't care, feel free to send it to me so I can buy a book locally without worry.",

Don't agonize over spending *double* the cost of something at an independent store to buy the same product. That's non competitive.

If I want a recommendation, I just go on GR, and I buy the book from Amazon. Local book stores do NOTHING better than Amazon, and cost significantly more. \n\nLike, I go to my local gun shop, and sometimes he gives me deals on guns or ammo. Not to mention, the prices are REALLY close to online, maybe a small amount more. My local cigar shop is exactly the same. Often I'll bring my cigars to the counter, he'll look at the rough amount, and take $5 off the rough amount. I have only underpaid there, and the prices are almost exactly the same as online. My local beer guy says, \"Hey man, check out this new weird beer I made.\" Is it good? Probably not, but it was interesting. \n\nDoes my local book store do that for me? Never, in all my time going, have I gotten a deal or a discount, and the prices are significantly higher then online. They have limited stock, for obvious reasons, and there's never anything weird or cool there. \n\nI've bought literally thousands of books in my life, and up until about 10 years ago, they were all from local shops. If I want a book and a mediocre cup of coffee, I can literally just bring a book to my local coffee place, and get the book I want, and a superior cup of coffee. \n\nIf local book stores can stay afloat, good for them. I'd never wish for someone's business, probably their dream, to die. But I'm not gonna buy books there as charity, either. There has to be some value there.",

Crowdsourcing has replaced the knowledgeable book or music store owner. \n\nYes, 30 years ago there was no real channels of the average consumer to buy books outside of bookstores. So bookstores existed. Now there are. \n\nIf a person feels that the bookstores, or any other stores, provide a service for them that is worth that markup, then by all means use them. But if those stores disappear because few people feel that the cost of their service is worth it to them, then that's just how humanity moves on.

            "comment": "In point of fact, the number of independent bookstores has *increased* by 35% between 2009 and 2015. So, in point of fact, Amazon has done enormous benefit to independent bookstores by crushing their monolithic, corporatized competition, the Borders and Barnes and Nobles of the world have withered, and small indie book-nooks have cropped up in their place. If they furnish a nice place to hang out and read, and serve you a decent cup of something not to drink and a baked good of some kind, they can do pretty well, and not even actually need to sell books.\n\nWhat's really bludgeoning these places right now is **FUCKING COVID-19**, because who is going to hang out in a public place to read when there's a pandemic going on? Ultimately, this too shall pass, and indie bookstores will be back, and what we really ought to be thinking about is how to prevent the next pandemic, by instituting travel bans and quarantines *before* the outbreak is beyond control. We had over three months between the first COVID reports and the too-little-too-late lockdowns in the USA, while the administration dithered and downplayed the risk. Well, here we are, 11 months from the first reported cases, and the U.S. has lost nearly 264,000 people from the disease.\n\nIn 2001, when a group of terrorists hijacked 4 passenger jets and killed under 3,000 Americans, the U.S. government went on to spend upwards of $6 trillion dollars thus far, with no end in sight, with the intention of preventing future terror attacks. Do you think it's unreasonable to spend a tiny fraction of that money to prevent 88 times the death toll? I don't.",

The only bookstores I visit are used ones because that is the only time the prices aren\u2019t ridiculously high.

The local cd stores wanted to sell them to us too. Times change and it\u2019s ok to be nostalgic about doing things a certain way. As a general rule goods and services are pushed by demand. Who knows maybe we will end up with books on demand for streaming price like music. The option will still be there for local, but it will be niche\u2014-that\u2019s where it\u2019s heading and no one can stop it. There was once a time when I\u2019m sure people worried about shopping with  local blacksmiths, horse stables and wagon wheel makers.",

I doubt that. \n\nI do not want to be very cynical since the times are trying indeed but I see these posts from time  and I just don\u2019t see how they are going to survive anyway since their service is just worse (smaller stock, usually no delivery, higher prices etc) than online retailers. I mean, I am sure that there are some people who would trade efficiency of buying stuff from a an online shop for some bookstore charm but clearly there is only enough of those people to justify existence for a small amount of physical book stores. Especially during a pandemic.\n\nAnd lastly, since the article is paywalled I do not know who\u2019s opinion it is in the title but come on.",

The brick and mortar options for all of my main hobbies - books, board games, comics, music - are all struggling to stay alive and I'm constantly being told that myself and other consumers should be preventing that.\n\nBut why? If the specific businesses aren't providing value to account for the markup, why should it be my responsibility to support them out of charity? If the local book or game store isn't providing a welcoming, fun place to enjoy what they sell why should I feel bad for saving money buying the same item online? Why should I go back to physical media purchases when there's no price, convenience, or environmental benefit to it?",

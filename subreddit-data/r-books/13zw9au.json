She also doubled down when called out it. She repeatedly defended herself by saying she\u2019s a comedian, which is giving off \u201cJust a joke, why are you so mad?\u201d vibes.",

Ebert gave The Godfather Part II 3 stars and he also gave The Fifth Element 3 stars. Somebody wrote in and asked \"does that mean you think The Fifth Element\" is as good as The Godfather Part II, one of the most heralded films in cinematic history?\" His reply included his favorite phrase which was also his movie review philosophy: \"it's not what a movie is about, it's how it's about it.\" Ebert believed that each movie was its own entity. Each had it's own set of goals and went about accomplishing them in its own way. To do this was not universal, thus a universal raring system wouldnt apply. A rating wasn't indicative of overall quality against every film ever, but against its own desire to achieve its goals. If Dumb and Dumber sets out to make you laugh and does so, is it not successful? The fact that Dumb and Dumber can never reach the emotional depths of Casablanca doesn't necessarily mean it's not as successful at accomplishming its own goals. So The Fight Element wasn't as good as Godfather Part II in Ebert's eyes, but it accomplished its own goals on the same level. \n\nAgain, not trying to tell anyone how to view their own scale, but merely point out that there is a philosophy out there where a random book is 5 stars and so is Les Miserables but that doesn't mean they are equal in accomplishment.",

Sister Act 2 is one of my all time favourites since I was a kid. It's a 4.5 star movie to me. I've given No Country for Old Men the same rating. Both of these movies cannot be compared as they are vastly different in many ways but I enjoyed them and understood the message they were set out to convey.  I just ask myself questions about each individual movie I see \"is this a good comedy movie?\" \"Is this a good dramatic film?\" \"Was the acting and dialogue convincing?\" Etc",

This is no matter what people are rating, grading or similar.\n\nDepending on how we make our scale. 0 stars would be 0-17th percentiles, 1 star 17-34th percentiles, 2 stars 34-51st percentiles 3 stars 51-68th percentiles, 4 stars 68-85 percentiles 5 stars 85th percentile and up. The 5 star rating should be something that is excellent, not just good or great. Most authors should not expect to reach the highest echelons, as most authors will not create the truly greats just like all other art, it is the few that are the most productive. a 4-starred book is still good or even great, and can still be worth a reread where you could discover new things.\n\nHigh ratings lose their meaning, if everybody gets it, then there is no reason to have any rating system, then we might aswell be full formative in the book reviews with no scoring at all. This could also add to the book reviews, as we would actually read them, instead of glossing over the score. As i think we all have done when going to school, looking through our grades, and then saw the grade for the paper, and thought oh well, not really reading the formative feedback from our educators.",

That said, 73% of books get 3-4 stars from me, and it does lack the nuance I want because for me 3=OK, 3.5=liked, 4=really liked. But Goodreads forces me to round my ratings either up or down, so I can only specify 3.5 through review text/shelves. And it\u2019s an extremely common rating for me. If I followed GR scale I wouldn\u2019t have this problem. But that wasn\u2019t where I started out as a reviewer so my scale was set already.",

I'd rather roll a dice or pick a book based on the cover than go there for recommendations. \n\nBooktok and Booktube are unwatchable. I haven't come across a single reviewer that wasn't talking like a developmental editor and doing it badly.  \n\n*\"Remember: when people tell you something's wrong or doesn't work for them, they are almost always right.

So far, everything I've seen has been so bad I just can't be bothered to dig any deeper. \n\nSo I guess my take is that booktok, booktube, and goodreads are just standard issue drama farms.

Since the nature of their podcast is guests who bring on an older book they think was underrated to talk about and the fact that the hosts have many female friends in the industry they've introduced me to so many amazing, overlooked female authors that for some reason (patriarchy) never made it into the literary canon. \n\nThere are some booktubers I like but one became a home renovation channel (which I still watch and really like, even more than her book content, but it's just not really a book channel now) and one we just have different tastes but I like the way she does her channel and feel like she'll try out what's popular but also stays true to her own reading taste (booksandlala) \n\nI agree that the pressure authors, especially new ones, have to do their own marketing and drum up their own hype can lead to a sort of uber-fication of the ratings where it becomes black and white - 5 star or terrible review. But it's not a car ride, it's a book and readers want to retain nuance in their reviews, also Goodreads as a site is for readers on top of just being a terrible vehicle for recommendations anyway.  \n\nI do think the fixation from authors especially is silly.

I've had 1* rating, one 2* and a handful of 3*, but overall my scores are in the mid - high 4s.  A few negative reviews aren't going to tank a book.  In fact, I take them as a positive thing because it proves that the reviews aren't all bought or done by family and friends!\n\nNot everyone is going to enjoy your book, and that's okay.  There is no universally adored work of fiction. And not all readers opinions are valid. That might sound rude, but I've seen people leave 1* reviews for Anne Frank's Diary because 'the ending wasn't realistic (they didn't even realise it wasn't a work of fiction), and 1* reviews on Amazon because the e-book hadn't been formatted correctly.  That's the fault of the publisher,  not the author. My only 2* rating came from a mutual acquaintance who rates every single book 1* or 2*, including award-winners and best-sellers. So, not all reviews are equal and ratings are often given for flimsy reasons. They really aren't worth getting worked up over.\n\nWhile I know that my books aren't going to be everyone's cup of tea, I know from the overall response that they are good books. My reaction to seeing my only 1* rating was, 'oh I wonder what inspired such a strong reaction? Never mind, I know it's not a 1* book.' No thoughts of ranting on social media or name-calling or complaining. That's the surest way to destroy your reputation and make sure your work doesn'tget read, even if you have written a genuinely good book.\n\n EDIT to add: the universe is testing me tonight! I write in a minority language. Someone not from my country,  who hasn't read a single book in my language (out of 200 on his Goodreads read list, which are all in English) gave my book a 2*. I doubt he was even able to read it. I am more bothered by this than I should be.",

Especially if it's a debut novel or author that could do with more promotion.\n\nBut I've also read some debut books that I personally found dreadful for various reasons. And I don't want to hurt their feelings and break their spirit by leaving it a negative review (in which I'd still be constructive and point out positives)...  Thing is it might just be me who didn't like it!\n\nAnd that's what I do hate a lot: people taking their opinion of a book/film/series as the truth. Recently someone on here warned readers of the Wool trilogy not to watch the series. I said I disagreed, and was told that that didn't make me right as it was simply awful, period.\n\nGuy/gal (most likely a guy though...) must be 12... Seriously..",

Getting published is fucking *hard,* and it\u2019s unfortunate she lost that opportunity. The novel sounds pretty interesting as well. I get why her publisher dropped her though. Actions do have consequences. Hopefully she can get her book out into the world someday.\n\nPeople review-bombing her book is also pretty shitty. Why do people have to go out of their way to be assholes? Why shit on her livelihood, her passion project? *Yes,* she was being a rude, snide dickhead. *Yes,* she deserves criticism. But what is the point of deliberately tanking reviews for a book that isn\u2019t even coming out anymore? What\u2019s the point in harassing this woman?\n\nCruelty is the point. The internet craves blood. This is why I completely stay away from BookTok, because this kind of tomfoolery only sours my enjoyment of literature. Why can\u2019t we all just shut the fuck up and read?",

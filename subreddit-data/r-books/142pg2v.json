    "postText": "I finished up reading this book recently, having picked it up at my local bookstore where it was prominently displayed. There\u2019s been a large amount of hype online about this book, and figured it must be an NYT #1 best seller for a reason. I enjoy video games, so I was unopposed to the premise and figured i\u2019d give it a read. \n\nThe Good:\nThe absolute best part of this book in my opinion are specific \u201czinger\u201d sentences that Zevin pulls out from time to time throughout the book. Generally they are just really stunning, eloquently written thoughts about life, friendship, and the relationships between people. You\u2019ll know them when you see them.\n\nAdditionally, there is a titular chapter written in the first person later on in the book, (trying to keep things spoiler free), that was absolutely beautiful, and truly, very sad. Hats off to Zevin for that as well.\n\nThe Bad:\nIn an interview, Zevin states she wanted to write a book about how \u201cthe most important person in your life doesn\u2019t need to be your husband/wife, or child, or family; that it can be a coworker, a friend, someone who inspires you creatively.\u201d\nZevin states she wanted to write about a complex but beautiful friendship that spans decades. While the relationship between the two main characters is certainly complex and in some ways realistic, this book is really about two emotionally stunted individuals who at every opportunity fail to meet the other halfway, or step outside of themselves for even a moment. Sadie is deeply suspicious, jealous, and hateful towards Sam for most of the book, and Sam spends his entire life too tied down and held back by his unresolved traumas and resulting complexes to behave like a normal, caring human being. \n\nDoes this make for an interesting dynamic/read? For me, not really. And frankly with each passing day since i\u2019ve finished this book I like it less and less. I have other issues, largely around the climactic event of the book, but it\u2019s hard to detail them without huge spoilers. Would love to hear other peoples takes on this book.\n\nTLDR: This book is about a friendship that is anything but beautiful, and it suffers for it. Whatever messages the book may have to relay about human nature are overshadowed by a relentlessly disappointing interpersonal narrative.",

            "comment": "I think that your \"bad\" is exactly what best exemplifies the love between these two though.  Just like IRL - sometimes the people you love the most are the ones it's easier to be angry at (even if they are not the cause of the hurt and anger), because we take these people for granted and use them to shuffle all of our baggage onto because we know - no matter what, that person will still love us at the end of the day.  Just because they don't speak for years - both Sadie and Sam are still a presence in each other's lives, and they know they always will be.",

                    "comment": "I see it differently. I see two people whose strained friendship was held together purely by a mutual friend (Marx) doing ALL of the emotional lifting, being the go-between, soothsayer, and emotional intelligence for the three.\n\nAnd without Marx, they have nothing left holding them together anymore and they essentially spend the remainder of the book apart. Is killing the only likable, human character in your book a good move for the readability of your novel? I don\u2019t feel like it is, but perhaps some people were still able to find enjoyment in the latter portion of the book.",

It was about childhood friends who start a business together that kept them entangled long after the friendship ended. No idea why it was described the way it was by the publisher.",

I felt nothing for the characters and was SO bored with this book. I saw rave reviews online about this book but I didn\u2019t enjoy it at all.",

I hate that a lot of their issues from far back when they were children to whatever point they got to is that they don\u2019t communicate. Sadie felt really peevish and she would blame other people for her actions just because she was doing it for them even though the other party didn\u2019t ask and had no way of knowing even.",

Parts were gorgeous and I genuinely enjoyed all the inside baseball video game stuff. But the friendship at the center read to me like an angsty romance novel, where the conflict is all driven by misunderstandings and poor or absent communication, and the characters never really seemed to realize this. I found it frustrating and unfulfilling.",

My friends said that it essentially is the same set up the rest of the way so I was fine not forcing myself to finish it out of principle. The fact that the main 2 characters are flat with zero development just dragged on and on. Marx was the only one who had some change, but we know what happens there. It had its moments, but this dragged on and should have ended halfway through when there was a clear pattern that Sam and Sadie weren't going to change for themselves or each other. Disappointing",

There is no \u201caha!\u201d moment where they finally learn to be considerate of one another and try to see where the other is coming from. Without Marx, they essentially wallow away the rest of the book wondering what to say to one another.",

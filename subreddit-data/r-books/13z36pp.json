    "postText": "There is a passage, and forgive me if this is a bit off from the text, but Vonnegut's character, Billy, is telling us that the tralfamadorians thought of time as a series of the rocky mountains, symbolic of time and it's events happening all at once, yet in confined moments, rather than the linear way humans experience it. This made me start thinking of predictable events as inevitabilities rather than things to dread. And I also don't feel as bad about forgetting memories, because I'm just as present in those moments in time as I am in this one. Sorry if this doesn't make sense, I'm tired and it's midnight, but thank you for reading.",

            "comment": "&gt;\u201cIt was a movie about American bombers in World War II and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this: American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.\n\n&gt;The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers , and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.\n\n&gt;When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again.\u201d",

We humans perceive the direction entropy increases in as the forward direction of time. So a direction of time naturally emerges from any situation where entropy hasn\u2019t reached the theoretical maximum value (which is when all atoms have broken down and the universe is just a photon gas). In our universe, that initial condition was the Big Bang and time runs \u201cforwards\u201d as we get further from that point.",

The thing is, as hard as it is for us to understand it on an intuitive level, it's literally true.\n\nFalling out from Einstein's work, we got the notion of spacetime. We never really stop and think about what, precisely, that means. Space and time are only unique concepts when you want to understand specific components of spacetime, it's always just spacetime though.\n\nSo, we understand this concept when we think in terms of just space - even though I'm not on the other side of Jupiter right now, the other side of Jupiter is still there. If I had a spaceship, I could travel to it. The same statement can be made in terms of time - even though I'm not in last Tuesday right now, last Tuesday is still there. If I had a timeship, I could travel to it. The concept is the same because in reality we are always talking about spacetime. \n\nThis gets more real when you factor in some other understandings we have through Einstein, like there being no privileged point or velocity in spacetime. Everything happening in spacetime is only happening relative to every other thing in spacetime and none of them are 'the default.' There is no center to the universe, there is no such thing as 'at rest,' and there is no universal clock ticking away perfect, universal seconds. So, to return to last Tuesday, there is a place in the universe where our last Tuesday is visible, right now. It's still present, it's still 'this moment' and happening 'right now' in that place. \n\nEverything that has happened, is still happening, and will always still be happening. Your 5th birthday is a discrete and impermeable place in spacetime that will always be there. \n\nThere is a useful graphical representation of this that helps with understanding it. They show an X,Y coordinate grid, or an X,Y,Z coordinate volume, where either the X component, or the X and Y components, are used to represent spatial coordinates and the remaining coordinate represents time. So, you can plot an object's trajectory through spacetime as being a trajectory through all four components (the three spatial and the one time). When you do this, and show it on screen, what you get is a line traveling through the plane or the volume. The thing to understand is that that line always exists. \n\nIf that line represented you, then you would only be aware of the point on it that represents your now. But your place in the universe, and your speed traveling through spacetime, are not privileged. There are other places and speeds in the universe where other parts of that line are visible. That is so because the entire line is always there.",

Forget all the fantasy of uploading individual consciousness into the cloud or some nanobot solution to aging. They are not functional in this moment. Each moment we are closer to physical death than the last. We might as well accept it.\n\nAnd there is some fear of a slow and painful death, but that\u2019s more about the suffering than the dying. \n\nDeath of being remembered. At 67 I have known SO MANY people, and many of them have been washed away into unconsciousness. And occasionally triggered into consciousness again by the scent of a flower, a similar tone of voice or the feeling of a breeze on my skin. But this fading away is again a natural process. And I have no strong impulse to create some kind of legacy that I will be remembered by. Knowing that this kind of death is a constant presence, however, helps me to better appreciate the people in my current life. The spark that we share.\n\nDeath of the knowledge of my existence. Can\u2019t even imagine this being important. The current prevalence of knowledge of my existence is so minuscule given how many people are on the planet. This death feels like a fading away of two dimensional impressions, faint images or ghostly voices softly losing form. It will be reduced to bits in some cloud, referenced and aggregated perhaps, but devoid of actual meaning.",

            "comment": "\"Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt.\" This is actually a subject near and dear to my heart and I've searched for a lot of media that also explored similar ideas, so I'll share some here as recommendations (I feel like this comment is the It's Always Sunny meme with the corkboard and the red string lol).\n\nLike many others in the comments, this book also profoundly impacted me. I related it a bit to the first few pages of Kundera's Unbearable Lightness of Being and how it explains Nietzsche eternal return: *\"If every second of our lives recurs an infinite number of times, we are nailed to eternity \r\nas Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross. It is a terrifying prospect. In the world of eternal \r\nreturn the weight of unbearable responsibility lies heavy on every move we make. That \r\nis why Nietzsche called the idea of eternal return the heaviest of burdens (das \r\nschwerste Gewicht).\"* I read this book a long time ago and don't know that it necessarily is the best exploration of this idea, but this and Slaughterhouse V made me think of time differently. In some of the most difficult moments of my life, it has helped to think that I am in a moment that is already over, that the beginning and the end exist simultaneously.\n\nJorge Luis Borges also explored alternate ways of thinking about time, both in short stories like \"The Garden of Forking Paths\"and \"Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, and Orbis Tertius\", or also in a short essay called \"A New Refutation of Time\": *\"Our destiny (unlike the hell of Sweden borg and the hell \r\nof Tibetan mythology) is not terrifying because it is unreal; it is terrifying \r\nbecause it is irreversible and iron-bound. Time is the substance of which I \r\nam made. Time is a river that sweeps me along, but I am the river; it is a \r\ntiger that mangles me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire that consumes me, but I \r\nam the fire. The world, unfortunately, is real; I, unfortunately, am Borges.\"* \n\nPeople in this comment section have also mentioned Arrival and the short story it is based on, and I think that Joanna Newsom explores almost identical ideas in her music, especially her album Divers. When Arrival came out, so many people in the Joanna Newsom Facebook groups started immediately comparing it to the last track on the album, \"Time, As a Symptom\": *\"But stand brave, life-liver\nBleeding out your days\nIn the river of time\nStand brave\nTime moves both ways\n\nIn the nullifying, defeating, negating, repeating\nJoy of life\nThe nullifying, defeating, negating, repeating\nJoy of life\n\nThe moment of your greatest joy sustains\nNot axe nor hammer\nTumor, tremor\nCan take it away, and it remains\nIt remains.\"*\n\nThis song actually gives closure to another song in the album, Sapokanikan, that is basically about the anxiety of all our deeds being meaningless the more time passes. \n\nFinally, I really enjoyed the film \"Synecdoche, New York\" and think the way it talks about time is very much linked to everything else I mentioned here.",

Determinism states that those quantum superpositions were determined in advance by the laws of physics. You're looking at quantum states rather than classical ones, but everything is still predetermined.\n\nYou'll notice that the article you linked doesn't say anything about determinism, let alone free will.\n\nIf you're wondering about quantum collapse not sounding deterministic, it's probably better to think in terms of many worlds. A quantum \"measurement\" separates \"a\" world into two -- but both were predetermined in advance.",

Once I started to think of the past as \"still happening\" just in another, earlier part of the timeline, it made the good memories I had of people I'd lost, not so tinged with sadness.

As far as the human mind is concerned, past and future are stories that we create. Whatever may have happened or may happen is inaccessible to us and can only be synthesized via the stories (memories, predictions, imagination, etc.) that we construct. But that framework also creates a kind of a constant striving and dissatisfaction, sometimes subtle and sometimes grotesque. Part of the experience of \u201cawakening\u201d experiences universally described by contemplative traditions, both Eastern and Western, is a sense of timelessness. The spirit of this is remarkably well-captured in Ted Chiang's short story, \"Story of Your Life\", on which the movie Arrival is based. \n\nThere's a good but accesible book on this by Edward Slingerland called *Trying Not to Try: Ancient China, Modern Science, and the Power of Spontaneity*.\n\nAnyway, when there's an inner relaxing of effort around that past/present/future storytelling mindset, the result is a sense of peace that you have stumbled upon. Little did you know, I'd wager, that by reading a popular science fiction novel you'd recreate a contemplative experience that is thousands of years old\u2014but that's another story\u2026",

This means that fretting over how something could have been prevented is pointless, and people should focus on acceptance.

I'm sorry if the cutting edge science of a hundred years ago really undercuts the vibe you were feeling with some poetical nonsense, but this isn't a mystery anymore. \n\n&gt;inevitabilities rather than things to dread. \n\nAccepting the inevitable is a psychological coping mechanism.

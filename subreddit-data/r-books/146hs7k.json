    "postText": "I like books you can pick up and read while you are reading a longer book, and either drop for some time or read a page at a time without any hurry to finish.\n\nI usually think of books like these in terms if \"non-fiction\", books of trivia, interesting facts or stories, small biographies or humorous books (the \"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader\" series comes to mind)\n\nMy personal favorite is \"The Book of Lists\" by David Wallensky, Amy Wallace and Irving Wallace. It contains the elements I mentioned with the added list structure and division by subjects. It has been pretty influential in my life\n\nHow about you all? Any books that you like/love/enjoy that fit the bill?",

Mellon, for a nickel to call a friend.\r  \nMellon replied, 'Here's a dime. Call up both of them!'\u201d \r  \n\r\r  \n\r\"\\[President\\] Cleveland liked his beer, and as a young man he spent plenty of time drinking, singing and chatting in the beer-gardens of Buffalo, NY.  In 1870, when he ran for district attorney of Erie County, he and his friendly opponent, Lyman K. Bass, agreed to drink only four glasses of beer daily.  But after they had met a few times on warm summer evenings to talk things over, they decided that their ration was too skimpy and so began to \\~anticipate\\~ their future supply.  A few evenings later, Bass suddenly exclaimed: 'Grover, do you know we have \\~anticipated\\~ the whole campaign?'  Cleveland nodded sorrowfully.  The next night, however, both of them brought huge tankards to the saloon, christened them 'glasses', and had no problem with the ration after that.\"",

There's also poetry, mysteries, essays, and I don't know what else.\n\nThe Outlaw Bible of American Poetry is fun.\n\nWhile Billy Connolly was the national poet laureate, he created a book called Poetry 180, designed for high schools to have one one short poem to read every day of the school year. I think there's also a sequel called More Poetry 180.",

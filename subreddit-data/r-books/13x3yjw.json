But the setting and prose, as well as the intimacy with which we view the characters and how they become real people, make them good to read. The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best books ever written and it\u2019s an outright page-turner.\n\nWhen I read an author saying \u201cReading the book is supposed to make you feel like you\u2019re having an anxiety attack in the way scrolling through Twitter literally does for me,\u201d It strikes me as almost a gimmick of sorts. As if readers are supposed to respond \u201cWow, this book really did make me feel anxious, therefore it succeeded.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m interested in compelling stories, characters and situations, and have never to date put down a book just because some specific thing happened that made me feel a negative emotion. \n\nBut pitching a novel as \u201cIt will make you feel bad in this very specific way\u201d makes me feel as if it is aiming to hammer me emotionally, with characters and plot as secondary elements to serve the goal of manipulating me into feeling an emotion. This is opposed to deeply connecting with a character and going through a range of emotions while following their story.\n\nI have obviously not read this book, it could be great! But the above is my reasoning for why I\u2019m not interested in books marketed like this. It\u2019d probably take a personal recommendation from someone I know IRL to get me to read it.",

It gives this extra-dimension where even the artist we\u2019re supposed to feel sorry for is a bit morally dubious",

But Athena is equally oblivious about wealth and class. So maybe she was the wrong person to tell this story too, about people living in poverty. The book raised all these interesting questions around who is the \u201cright\u201d person to tell a story, how much does that have to do with their identity vs their mentality, and is identity a proxy for mentality.",

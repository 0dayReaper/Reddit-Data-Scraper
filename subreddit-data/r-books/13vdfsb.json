    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'm curious how folks around here are tracking their personal libraries - if they are at all. My wife and I have just over 680 physical books in just about every room of our house and for the past 10 years I've tracked them all in a spreadsheet that's gotten more and more detailed. I'm no data scientist or even all that great at excel, but man do I love my books. Below are some screenshots and details about the tracker, but I've always thought there must be a better way!\n\n* [Main Library Page](https://imgur.com/WXEnryK) \\- columns from left to right\n   * Read - have I read the book?\n   * Date - what year did I read it.\n   * Author\n   * Title\n   * Published year\n   * Genre\n   * Sub-Genre\n   * Series\n   * Notes - Primarily used to track 1st editions and signed 1st editions\n   * Type - Hard cover, Paperback, Mass Market, or Audio\n   * Read - separate column for my wife\n   * Author sex - may cause some contention but I was curious about the ratios\n   * I also have it built out so the row that is currently selected is highlighted in green.\n* [Statistics page](https://imgur.com/KZouyKr)\n   * Total number of books read by genre and by person, as well as a running total of all books by genre.\n   * Format - Total number of books in each print style.\n      * Boy do we love hardbacks!\n   * *Rough* price estimates - Hardcover at $24.99, Mass market at $7.99, and Trade at $14.99\n      * Not really accurate on our spending as we buy used a lot and I was a bookseller with a large discount for many years.\n   * Edition - 1st edition, signed 1st edition, and ARCs\n   * Author gender\n      * Really gotta up our game here\n   * Percent of library read by both of us collectively\n      * Woo at 77%!\n   * Books in a series vs stand alone\n      * We read a lot of fantasy\n   * Published year\n      * Primarily 1990+\n   * Unread - sorted by genre and split up for both of us.\n* [Graphs and Charts](https://imgur.com/1EPByj7)\n   * Visual overview of some of the statistics on the previous page\n* [Books that have won both the Hugo and the Nebula](https://imgur.com/sYRFmpe)\n   * This is just a list of books that have won both the Hugo and the Nebula awards for Best Novel - while I think both awards are great independently they tend to be biased on their own so I figured the ones that won both have a little more merit.\n   * I would like to track other award winners, but I'm embarrassed to say we probably don't have too many beyond the random Pulitzer here and there.\n\nBefore someone asks, we both use **Goodreads**\\*,\\* but to track *all* the books we read which is quite a bit more since we're avid library users.\n\nWhat are you guys using to track your books? Are you tracking or am I crazy? What other statistics or information can I add that might be missing? (**Note**: it is too much of a pain in the ass to try and do page count and there is not a reliable source for word count that I can find).\n\nI'm also happy to share the actual spreadsheet for others to use (unless that isn't allowed?).\n\nEDIT:\n\nHoly shit did Imgur kill the resolution - try these:  \n\\- [Library](https://i.imgur.com/WXEnryK.png)  \n\\- [Statistics](https://i.imgur.com/KZouyKr.png)  \n\\- [Graphs and Charts](https://i.imgur.com/1EPByj7.png)  \n\\- [Nebula/Hugo](https://i.imgur.com/sYRFmpe.png)",

I\u2019ve been using the app LibraryThing to get a basic idea of how many I have and what they are, but I\u2019m planning on setting up a spreadsheet similar to what you have so I can record details.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy.

You can see that once I didn't even track *when* I last read a book: I only added that feature in 2012, which is why there are many books that are marked as read but don't have a date.\n\nI've considered adding a wishlist feature to it, but having a separate note with books I want in it works just fine.",

    "postText": "Until I read it, I had no emotional comprehension or stance on the prospect of slavery. I never disputed that slavery was wrong, immoral, and, in its own ways, evil. Despite this, I was emotionally indifferent towards slavery. I haven\u2019t been a slave. Those I care about haven\u2019t been slaves. My people have never been slaves. Slavery, in its traditional sense, is non-existent.\n\nI was looking for my first novel - a gay story with aspects of domination, degradation, and humiliation. Yet, I did not comprehend or foresee what I was about to undertake.\n\nI identified strongly with Damianos; it felt as though I was the slave, experiencing everything Damianos did. I felt sickened, angry, and disgusted with what I was reading. The abhorrence of slavery revealed itself to me in full. I could no longer emotionally be indifferent to slavery, having felt but a fraction of real slavery while reading the novel. It was this revelation that helped me understand why the British Empire waged war on the Slave Trade, crushed it, freed the slaves, and used its might to uphold individual freedom. I could comprehend what motivated the British imperial soldiers to wage this war, even die fighting it. There was nothing more righteous my people\u2019s empire ever did; it was that war against slavery that outweighed all the negatives of my people\u2019s empire.\n\nAt times, I felt aroused as the story unfolded; it did have elements of sexual dominance and degradation, albeit infrequently. As the story progressed, Damianos and his owner become lovers in all but name, until the third book, that is.\n\nI would recommend this novel trilogy for teens mature enough to understand and comprehend its themes. Instead of just telling them that slavery is bad, have them read it, let them feel it on a surface level. No documentary will make you feel the sickness, anger, and disgust that was the Slave Trade as much as this trilogy. It is a masterpiece. I plan to have my brothers and sisters read it when they are old enough and willing, provided they wish to after I inform them adequately.",

For me, it isn\u2019t the physical abuse, nor the emotional abuse which is truly abhorrent in my eyes, it is the removal of freedom, that is what I view as the real abhorrence of slavery. The emotional and physical abuses are secondary to that. I genuinely believe that it is more merciful to be killed than enslaved. I value free will above all else, anything that takes that away on such a scale is evil. \n\nI shall correct you. I am British. I am English.

Do you have PTSD which is the embodiment of a traumatic experience? \n\nI say this plainly: you have as much experience as a slave as I do. Which is to say - zero. \n\nYou claimed you have trauma because your progenitors were once slaves centuries ago. I would like to know how this is possible. To be traumatised by an experience you have never had. \n\nAll the people who were once slaves in the traditional manner, they are all dead, all rotting, as are the slave owners, buyers and sellers. I don\u2019t see how it is of any consequence that your progenitors were slaves. If your grandfather and grandfather, one or both of them were slaves and still alive, then I would consider that your assertion about trauma may have truth to it. But I doubt that is the case. Only those who have experienced being a slave can claim to have trauma from it. \n\nIt is like me saying: I am terrified of Germans and Germany because of their air raids upon my grandmother, who was old enough to remember it. I have no fear of Germans or Germany, and yet, such bombings were not so long ago that they are beyond remembrance of those among the living. \n\nMy grandmother told me of what it was like. As a kid, it would make my heart beat fast. It was scary, but I held not hold no fear or stigma of Germans or Germany. I did not feel or hear their bombings of my people. \n\nEqually, the same applies to you.",

I may have not been a slave but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t carry the hardships of my ancestors, nor does that mean the trauma they experienced doesn\u2019t impact the way in which I view and interact with the world. Not to mention the fact that the ending of slavery didn\u2019t simply usher in a new age of prosperity, but only more torment as Black people were still barred from being a part of society for a long time. We have grandparents that lived through Jim Crow. Firsthand accounts of bizarre cruelty. If you don\u2019t think there\u2019s any trauma in learning that only a generation or so separates you from a time when people would rather hang you in a tree then let you use a public restroom, I don\u2019t know what else to say.\n\nTo try to settle matter as, \u201cWell did you know slaves?\u201d is ignorant and demonstrates callousness.

                    "comment": "Every country throughout human history has, at one point, been implicated in the institution of slavery. Yet, at the zenith of its power, the British Empire abolished slavery - a move not dictated by coercion but underpinned by Christian principles. The British people did not finish paying the compensation for the emancipation of slaves from their owners until around 2014 or perhaps 2015. Up until then, 40% of our national debt was attributed to the emancipation of slaves. Additionally, nearly one million British natives collectively lost their lives in the struggle against the Slave Trade. We established the first human rights organisation in history, and it was only due to the unrivalled strength of the British Empire that the French and Spanish Empires were compelled to reform - not immediately, but gradually.\n\nThese are the facts as I understand them.\n\nI do not deny that the empire of my people has been responsible for some abhorrent acts. However, given the choice of which empire to reside within, it would unequivocally be the British Empire. We did not segregate by colour, and we treated women with respect. We enforced the death penalty for those who inflicted harm upon women, ended the savagery of cannibalism, and halted the practice of Indian widows being burnt alive, under threat of death and land confiscation.\n\nAdmittedly, we have committed terrible actions. The atrocities of the opium trade and imperialism have left indelible stains on our history. However, one monumental action outweighs all: Queen Victoria\u2019s imperial decree in 1833, which outlawed slavery. With this decree, the empire embarked on a war, a war I can declare, with complete sincerity, as the only righteous war against a trade that was undeniably and entirely evil. Wars are seldom straightforward, but this particular war was unambiguously so. We waged this war alone, without any materialistic motivations, guided only by justice and righteousness \u2013 the path Christ would have desired for the liberation of men from such cruel oppression.\n\nNeither France nor Spain, the other significant empires, desired to free themselves from slavery, nor from the evil and abhorrence that it represented. They were consumed by greed and showed no remorse. Consequently, we resolved to wage war against them - against any who refused to take a stand against slavery. The choice was clear: you were either with us or against us.\n\nThis aspect of my history was never taught in school. I had to learn it on my own.\n\nRegarding the book - have you ever experienced or understood empathy? If so, you would comprehend my admission that I can now partially grasp the emotional malevolence and wickedness of slavery. I conceded that I could only empathise to a limited extent. Apparently, you lack such a capacity for emotion\u2026 my younger self would find this amusing. There was a time when I was devoid of empathy, remorse or compassion.\n\nI am aware of my history and acknowledge that my people, like all others, are not without flaws. Nevertheless, we were the pioneers in questioning the ethics of slavery, and we did so because we possessed the power, because we were Christians and, above all, because we were British!\n\nToday, the world has largely forgotten the sorrow of traditional slavery since it was a practice of a bygone era. A few malevolent countries still engage in slavery, although they do not openly admit to it. Today\u2019s Britain lacks the power to intervene. If we still possessed the strength we once had, countries like China and others engaging in enslavement and oppression would have been held accountable.\n\nMy life has not been a bed of roses. At the age of 13, I made a statement in a history class that my peers could not comprehend: \u201cWithout Hitler\u2019s heinous acts, the world would not be as peaceful as it is today. Hunger and starvation would be more widespread. The robust global viewpoint against human rights violations wouldn\u2019t exist. The discourse and yearning to avoid wars wouldn\u2019t be as intense. Yes, conflicts and confrontations will always exist, but not on the scale previously witnessed. The Five Powers of the world will avoid such wars if possible. Without the atrocities of Hitler, without the suffering and evil in that war, would the world be as peaceful? I don\u2019t believe so.\u201d My classmates accused me of supporting Hitler, despite my statement suggesting nothing of the sort. I assessed his actions with emotional detachment, acknowledging the malevolence of his deeds, but still noting their causality and effect.\n\nI don\u2019t have an ordinary perspective. My observations often diverge from others\u2019 due to their emotional attachments.\n\nYou might be swept up in the current of anti-British sentiment. I bear no ill will towards you for this. Rather, I encourage you to delve into the history of how the British Empire abolished slavery and what that entailed. Consider how this action shaped the world as we know it, and ponder what the world might look like if the British Empire had not existed.",

We didn't go into debt for nearly 200 years to wipe away their boo boos.\n\nYou would think that if anyone would be compensated, it would be the enslaved people who had been stolen from for generations. Those people who had imprisoned, humiliated, and bred like animals. Instead, the British Empire that you claim was so opposed to slavery tore open the treasury and dumped it out into the feeding trough for jilted Victorian slave owners.\n\nSpare us.\n\nWhat you're saying has little to do with logic or empathy, and everything to do with feelings.

The law. \n\nBefore slavery was against the law, it was unfortunately legal. Britain, like many other countries worked and functioned on the principle of the law, the rule of law. \n\nAs abhorrent as it was, in the eyes of the law slaves were property as a dog would be. It is unimaginable, I can\u2019t understand how that would be so. When the law of the Empire changed, because we worked on the rule of law, there legally needed to be compensation for the \u2018losses' to the owners. I write that sentence with a sickening churn in my stomach, it is truly revolting, yet it doesn\u2019t change the way the law works. \n\nI offer no excuses, none at all for your point in regards to the Slave owners should not have been compensated, at least not morally, why? Because humans are not property to be owned, sold or bought. But I once again must reiterate that the law stated there needed to be compensation, unfortunately. \n\nIt is even more unfortunate and unjust that there was no compensation for the former slaves who weee freed. I am in complete and undisputed agreement that the Slave owners should not have been compensated, but rather the former slaves instead. Without question or a second thought. \n\nDon\u2019t make me laugh! America? Killed the slave owners? Where you get that from? Are you referring to the confederates? It was way more than about slavery, it was a war again slavery but also a civil war. Do you forget that America was still having slaves kept way after the empire abolished it? Do you forget that America remained racist for many years, decades and even a whole century? That Americans were the ones to segregate black and whites. That Americans refused to let black people go to college, so the military had to get involved to make it clear that the college and others would not stop American citizens from learning. Do you forget this? \n\nDo you forget that even in World War II Americans remained racist. Even today, while there is no longer systemic racism in the eyes of the law: out of all western countries, America, in terms of individuals, is the most racist. Is this something you have forgotten or simply refuse to acknowledge? \n\nI have never met a racist British man, women or child, not once. I have seen videos here and there, but never once met one. \n\nI have never once denied the wrongdoing of my people\u2019s empire. I remain resolute in my statement: the British empire and its abolishment, and war against slavery is that outweighs its wrongdoings. We had nothing to gain, we had everything to lose, including our empire. No other empire did such a thing. No other country would have done such a thing if not for the empire. \n\nI shall end on the note which emphasises your lack of understanding in regards to the law: the slave owners were compensated because they were (up until that point), the slaves, seen in the eyes of the law as property, as such the law stated there needed to be compensation. I don\u2019t argue against it being wrong and unjust, not all laws are fair or just, this in particular a prime example.",

I grew up in care, with all sorts of people from all sorts of places around the world. I have a good understanding of the culture and history of other people. \n\nEvery single African I have met, the older ones, the ones who helped look after me, I asked them about their view on the British empire: they all said that without the empire slavery would have not stopped when it did. They said that it wasn\u2019t the British who came over, held them at the end of a musket and took their people into slavery\u2026 it. Was. The. Leaders. Of. Their. Own. County. Who. Sold. Them. And it was the British who put a stop to it. \n\nThey said that the empire left them with a functioning society. Functional infrastructure. That their people fell into corruption the moment the empire backed its bags. That when the empire left lawlessness took hold. \n\nI don\u2019t make any excuses. I simply state facts. I have never once made excuses about the slave trade, it was the most evil trade in human history and existence.",

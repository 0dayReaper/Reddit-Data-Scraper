Usually I\u2019ll find the book, manga, or WEBTOON and read it myself and then pass it onto them and we all discuss it and enjoy it. We came up with a super fun idea that while I\u2019m reading these books I should annotate them and then send the annotated versions to my friends so they can see the funny little notes and reactions. Does anyone know a way to do this?",

This summer I want to do a tattoo that represents my love for books, I have the basic image worked out (something about entering into another dimension when reading) but I wanted to do something more personal and include little easter eggs, simple things from my favorite books. If you guys could help and throw some ideas that would be amazing! I have some imagery that stayed with me after reading these books but if I could get your opinion it would help a lot!  \nThose are:\n\nKafka on the Shore  \nNorwegian Wood  \nOne Hundred Years of Solitude  \n1984  \nLord of the Rings  \nThe Little Prince  \nPara onde v\u00e3o os guarda-chuvas",

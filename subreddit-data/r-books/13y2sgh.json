Does the NYT Best Seller label serve as a guarantee of a high-quality book? In my experience, it's a hit or miss when it comes to books labeled as NYT Best Sellers.

I assume the NYT list must be *long* and broken down into a ton of highly specific subgenres. \n\nAlso maybe the fact that you only have to have high sales for a single week allows release-week blips to get something onto the list even if it isn\u2019t actually popular, if it just had some decent marketing.",

With 52 weeks in a year, 10-15 spots in each category, and the possibility for turnover every week, a good number of books will end up with the NYT bestseller label.\n\nThat said, the vast majority of books don't make it onto the list. It is still an achievement! And keep in mind that if you see just \"bestseller\" on a book, it doesn't always mean NYT bestseller. There are other lists too, like USA Today or the Indie bestseller list. \n\nAnd to answer your other question, no, it doesn't necessarily mean a book is good if it's on the list. It just sold more copies than others in its category. Some very popular books are, in my opinion, not very good.",

They have no major presence on things like reddit/goodreads/booktok/booktube/booktok but they are millions of them. Their buying power is enormous, so if you can sway even part of this mass to buying a book it will make a huge difference.  But the only way you can do that is on the book itself, so people in supermarkets and the airport book shop can see it. Like Oprah's book club stickers used to make a book. Getting that little sticker was career making. NYT bestseller isn't quite as gold but it is something, it is a reassurance to the casual reader. \n\n(Nothing wrong with being a casual reader btw)\n\nThe thing about publishing is that a couple of times a year. A bunch of editors and suits go into a room or virtual room with all the books they are going to publish that list and they decide who is going to get what from the publicity budget. Say Book A gets a good push and Book B does not. Then Book A will get more sales to bookshops and mass retailers, get more reviews, get more pre-orders, get on the NYT bestseller lists. Because of all of the above it gets more sales. Book B will struggle to earn out it's advance and it's writer will struggle to sell their next book. Of course there are exceptions, a Book B that explodes and a Book A that fades away. But in general the marketing budget is the biggest indicator of what levels of sales a book will have. \n\nThere are a lot of factors which decides which will be in the Book A pile and who in the Book B pile. But essentially it is a small group of people deciding and those people have their biases, their likes and dislikes, their ideas of what will sell or what will bring prestige to their brand. They need the casual reader money and they court them assiduously but they don't respect them. They don't think they want quality and so low quality books will get the Book A treatment and will get the NYT Bestseller tag. While Book B's which might have better quality will not. \n\n(I made this Book A and Book B for ease but there are probably a number of differing levels and strategies. But that definitely includes very low effort strategies)",

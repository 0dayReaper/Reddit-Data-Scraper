            "comment": "What books do you read as ebooks vs. physical books? I generally go with the following rule: if it's in the public domain I (legally) download it for free; if it's a contemporary copyrighted work I usually buy a physical copy. I'm not above pirating ebooks, but I honestly find it unnecessary; there are so many good works of literature in the public domain.",

So I usually end up getting ebooks for self pub stuff (the indie ebooks are often $2.99 \u2014 how can I pass up that kind of deal?) and physical books for trad pubs.",

But then I found out on the copyright page that the publishes might've censored any extreme views that goes contrary to modern sensibilities. I was hoping anyone knows of an edition of the complete series that I don't have to worry it being censored.",

I'm struggling to get into King's Evil because I can't remember what happened previously. I've googled like crazy, but I'm only getting the \"blurb\", not an actual recap of the full plot. Sadly I won't be able to reread those two.",

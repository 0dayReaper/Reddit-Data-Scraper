Starting in 7th grade and for the next 20 years I obsessively always had a book in my backpack or with me at all times if I could help it. Sometimes I would have 2 or 3 books with me just in case I might finish the book I was on and need another book before I had a chance to go home and get another. Sometimes I would make an emergency run to the book store to buy the next book in the series I was reading. And I would often feel a slight panic if I ever found myself without a book handy.   \n\nNowadays I consume all my books in audio form and its been a few years since I read a book in book form. I just don't really have time to sit down and read a book so if it wasn't for Audiobooks and being able to listen while doing other things I wouldn't be able to consume any literature.  \n  \nThere are downsides to audiobooks like how if anything else catches too much of my attention I will miss a few words or sentences and the completionist side of me kind of hates this. But another upside is finding favorite narrators and finding other books read by those narrators. And every so often you get a proper voice cast and sound effects that make it a much richer experience.\n",

As such, you've probably heard the gist of most of the ancient stories, updated to the time of the printing press (or Disney).",

The longest period I'll typically read in one sitting is in ever-shrinking economy aircraft seats traveling to see family, or perhaps a few times on vacation if I'm not busy with other things. In all those situations, the Kindle can't be topped.",

The last sentence is such a farce too. The headline of the article is just an inference from the fact that people aren't reading on their iPads and mobile phones, and having those devices means they read less often. That's an illogical conclusion to draw when you're including devices that have 100 other uses than reading in the equation. \n\nUntil someone does a study of eReaders against books straight up and asks for preferences, we're never getting a real answer to this question. \n\n",

            "comment": "This is actually a really poorly conducted study. It only asks if the child has an eReader and how often they read eBooks and how often they read paper books. It assumes children of age 8 - 12 with eReaders have equal access to and choice of both eBooks and paper books. It tracks how these children read, not why they read in that way.\n\nChildren ages 8 - 12 don't buy books. They are given access to them as gifts and from school and local libraries. The format they read them is based on the person actually providing the book. \n\nMy 11 year old is currently reading the paper version of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy because I gave her the paper version for Christmas. Prior to this she read the eBook versions of Harry Potter, because I shared it from my Kindle library.\n\n\n",

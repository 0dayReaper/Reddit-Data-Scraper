    "postText": "first time poster but I had to find a place to share this because surely this is strange, right? \n\nI just finished reading Finlay Donovan Is Killing It by Elle Cosimano (really loved it, by the way!) and at the end of the ebook (on Apple Books) they included an excerpt from what I assumed to be the next book. It was about 2 chapters, and there was no mention of it being the THIRD installment in the series, and only labeled it as the \u201cnext installment in the Finlay Donovan series.\u201d \n\nThen, when I started reading the next book in the series, I realized the content wasn\u2019t lining up between the excerpt and what I was currently reading, and I realized they had included the excerpt of the third book, not the second one. \n\nIs that normal? I\u2019ve never seen a book do that and I\u2019m a little disappointed because it spoiled some of the second book. While I\u2019ll still be reading the series, I feel like most readers are always excited to read additional content in a book and perhaps the excerpt should\u2019ve been more clearly labeled as the third book. \n\nWhat do y\u2019all think?",

I was extremely annoyed when I finally realized it was an excerpt from book 3 instead of 2. I understand that they\u2019re trying to promote book 3 since it recently came out, but this is **not** the way.",

    "postText": "Heroine is a book about a teenage athlete named mickey who breaks her hip in a car accident, promptly after she\u2019s prescribed oxycontin to help with the pain. Mickey ends up hooked on oxy but eventually runs out and so she tries to get her prescription refilled where after failing, she meets edith who just so happens to sell oxycontin. Soon after Mickey meets Josie and before they know it they end up trying Heroin. This book is a great read if you like contemporary YA reads, it\u2019s also a haunting book from the first line which is \u201cwhen i wake up all my friends are dead\u201d",

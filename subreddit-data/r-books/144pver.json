    "postText": "I am going to come out and say that this book is one of the best and most important pieces of literature in recent history.\n\nIt is no easy read, it clocks in around 900 pages and describes the very recent history of the United States and then carries into the future. It's main premise is the steadily advancing climate crisis which is rapidly spiraling into worse and worse weather events and contributing to chaos across the country. As the reader, you are taken into the lives of several different key characters - a climatologist, a climate change warrior advocate, an eco-terrorist cell leader, a neurodivergent numbers wizard who turned from sports betting to climate modeling, a poverty-stricken resident of rural-suburban Ohio, a marketing executive, and countless political figures that are fictional but fleshed out in believable and meaningful ways. Each character brings their own angle to the broader story, and each one is written in their own unique style and with their own unique voice in a way that greatly expands the overall story.\n\nTaking place from 2013-2040 and weaving together these story threads into a grand narrative surrounding the political developments of the timeframe, all backed by the growing roar of the climate crisis, The Deluge is a masterpiece of fiction. Its humanity, its set pieces, and its intricacy and care in handling incredibly complicated topics such as climate science or the process of a bill being passed in congress to make them palatable to the average reader is no small feat. Despite its detail, it reads like a page turning thriller. I was astounded by this book, page after page. It captivated me in a way very few books ever have.\n\nI am highly recommending that everyone who sees this post reads this book. It is a book that will stick with you for a long time, leaving your stomach in knots and forcing you to contemplate the contemporaneous moment of our real lives.",

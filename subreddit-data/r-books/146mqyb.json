    "postText": "Hey all.\n\nLike the title says, I'm curious if you hit a point in your life when reading suddenly \"clicked\" for you. On the other hand, did your love of reading happen gradually?\n\nI'll be honest: I'm 21, taking a gap year, and I didn't start reading for fun until a few days ago (which I'm pretty upset about). Sure, I read a decent amount during school, but none of it was \"pleasure reading\" for me. I'm working my way through Crime and Punishment right now and I absolutely LOVE it. At first, I was sort of forcing my way through it, but then, I got totally engrossed in its psychology of the main character and the symbolism to the point where I was absorbed in it. It was really amazing to finally understand the joy of reading, even though it happened so late!\n\nSo, anyways, how did it happen for you?",

            "comment": "I\u2019ll give you 2 diff experiences:\n\n\nMe: I got into reading as a kid in 5th grade reading all the goosebump books..read like crazy for a while and of course Harrry Potter helped. Then academic books kind of killed reading for me from age 20 to about 26. Then I read a book or 2 a year. Didn\u2019t get back into reading until 2 years ago in my 30s when I started getting recommendations from my sister and a friend and we are reading buddies that talk about reading all the time. \nIt\u2019s really a great hobby once you\u2019re really into it. For me, as an adult, it clicked when I bought a Kindle in 2021 and was able to check out books through Libby. I\u2019m not spending money to buy books and figure out which ones I love. \n\nMy sister: hates reading, hated books, tried reading and would put it down after 5 pages bc it\u2019s not \u201cher thing\u201d. Late 20s, I recommended a book to her and we started a book club with some friends and she wanted to be a part of it so she just tried reading.\n\nThat book (The Last time I lied by Riley Sager) is what clicked for her. Since then she\u2019s been reading and she actually reads more than me. It\u2019s been 2 years and it\u2019s fun to talk to her and get recommendations from each other and talk about how stupid some characters are and stuff.\n\nBased on my sister\u2019s experience, I would say it\u2019s about finding your niche. In the past I\u2019ve tried to read the classics and stuff that ppl say are \u201cmust reads\u201d and it made me hate reading. It\u2019s about finding your genre, exploring other genres when you feel comfortable, go at your own pace, challenge yourself to x amount of time or x amount of books if you want, find people or join book clubs locally to get a community out of it.\n\nIt\u2019s a hobby that\u2019s completely yours\u2014it\u2019s your world and your mind that creates the worlds you read about.",

I can look back and see a lot of missed opportunities but I\u2019m also happy with where I\u2019m at today.   And if you\u2019re reading Dostoevsky at 21 you have me beat by about a decade, so enjoy, it\u2019s certainly a wonderful pastime.",

I had an existential crisis that led to me to religion/spirituality books, but the big breakthrough was fiction. I always thought I could get my fiction through tv and film, but working my way through the classics, short stories, and now even poetry. History should taken in like a work of fiction but I digress. The world is full of great minds that have left behind absolute treasures. It\u2019s a shame when we ignore them or shut off because they might seem dated or inaccessible. There is plenty of commentary that can help these days. Once it clicks, it is a joy for life.",

I tried reading a few books before then, but I just couldn't read more than one or two chapters. But when I started the 9th grade our Romanian teacher told us to write a short recommendation for our favourite book and I realised I didn't have one and for some reason I felt kind of bad about that. That was the day I decided I would find a favourite book and soon after that I finished my first full novel. I suddenly started to enjoy books and reading bacame my hobby. I don't know what changed in my brain that day, but I am grateful that my teacher gave me the push I needed to start reading. \ud83d\ude06",

It wasn't until my 4th grade teacher, Mrs. Rosenthal, got her hands on me. She saw my potential and intelligence and pushed me to work at my studies and reading. She accepted no excuses from me and ensured I grew as a person. That year the book fair came through and my parents encouraged me to pick something I was interested in. I found a book on Greek gods and goddesses and I fell in love with reading. I still have that book on my shelf, and I'm in my 30's. Now I love to read. All thanks to that book and Mrs. Rosenthal.",

I still read comics and manga but that was about it. It wasn't until late summer of last year that I fell down the rabbit hole of disturbing and transgressive literature.

I remember the words and how I would recognize the shapes but I wasn't quite able to wrap my head around reading the shapes.\n\nThen, a couple months into Kindergarten it clicked and I could read.  After that, it was smooth sailing.  \n\nNow a lot of that really came from being read to a lot when I was a kid.  My grandma always read Jack London books to me, or Alice in Wonderland, Sherlock Holmes stories, that sort of thing.  I listened to books on tape/record all the time too.  I remember being really freaked out by the record of \"The Gold-bug.\" by Edgar Allen Poe.  I don't know why that one scared me, but it did.  It must have been the voice talent.\n\nNow my friend who's family was less into reading, as in no reading at all, never could read well until about 6th grade.  He started reading romance novels just because they were easy reads and that really helped him become able to read at his grade level. From then on, he read all the time.\n\nI think a love of reading comes from starting very early.  You can acquire it later in life, but it's harder to start.",

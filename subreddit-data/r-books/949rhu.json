Knowing that I've supported the author directly and not worrying about having to return a book on time are nice imo. Plus, sometimes I find myself needing to reference one of my instructional manuals years after buying them, and owning them makes it easier to do so in a timely manner. That being said I'm by no means rich, and hauling physical books around whenever I have to move is a challenge now that I have bilateral carpal and cubital tunnel syndrome. There are pros and cons to both approaches, and sometimes libraries are optimal to personal archives like you said. I just realized that since I don't disagree with anyone in this comment thread my post is fluff, so enjoy your day friend.",

Buying books will actually support the author. So if more people buy books that in theory creates more room in the community to support more authors which means better quality should be available and more readily available. Libraries are a great source but without people buying the books to support the community libraries would die",

Or being completely inundated with it 24/7, presented in a way that seems like the world is going to come crashing down any minute?\n\nWe\u2019ve had shitty presidents in the past. Hell we\u2019ve had presidents commit mass genocide...crazy love affairs/scandals...straight crooks.  We\u2019ve had them lead us into massive wars...and ignored global atrocities. We even had a president who divided the country so much the civil war happened. Trump is not the first terrible person to make it into the White House...and depending on the standards you\u2019re looking at, he\u2019s unfortunately probably not the worst. \n\nOnly difference now is it\u2019s shoved in our faces live every few minutes when we browse the news, go on social media, turn on our phones...etc etc.  And for the first time in history every soundbite and video clip is captured in HD, and broadcast instantly around the world. We can\u2019t escape it. We have to hear and see every douchey comment. We get tainted by his supporters on FB and YouTube. We even see every crazy thought that runs through his head on Twitter.\n\nAnd with the internet allowing anybody to publish information globally...news organizations are now competing against every single other news organization in the world...plus every 2nd rate content producer. Inflammatory headlines are no longer just a profit incentive....it\u2019s the only way media companies can survive these days.\n\nThe way we consume politics is unlike anything ever experienced in all of human history. And it\u2019s not necessarily a good thing.\n\nIf there\u2019s one point I agree with Trump on...is that the media gives him an insane amount of coverage trying to drive ratings. And they\u2019re turning every single crazy word that comes out of his mouth into a breaking headline. \n\nThis in turn ensures the really important policy stuff is lost in all the crazy noise.\n\nThe media is not the enemy. But I think the 24 hour news cycle is seriously toxic to the wellbeing of humanity. When we have a non stop stream of information that seems overwhelmingly negative (to the point where we now are surprised to see anything positive in the news), and where everything becomes a headline to fill up space, it\u2019s no surprise people are on edge.",

And plenty of educated people aren't smart or got easy degrees, to counter the \"people with degrees vote Democrat\" argument. Plenty of very smart tradespeople are conservative and have no degree.

So it might be that people who haven't got anxiety as a proper condition, but who have just added anxious times (they are very different) recognise that and but the books.\n\nAlso there is a possibility of self diagnosis error. For example if you tell people there's a big disease outbreak and say the symptoms, people often start seeing those symptoms in themselves.",

It can be difficult sometimes, but our lives are worth working toward a state of general happiness. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to be \u201cgiddy\u201d all day, every day.

So many people are scared of the future that it is hurting a lot of people mentally. \n\nI had anxiety and depression in HS and luckily climbed out of it.   Lately I have felt it creeping back up on me.   The future really feels hopeless at times.  ",

            "comment": "I can think of a few reasons:\n\n1. The news is constantly telling us to be afraid, 24/7 - there's a wildfire, Trump is ruining the country, Russians are hacking our elections, etc.  Additionally, the news does a very poor job of telling us what are actual, likely risks (for example, the odds of your kid getting snatched off the street by a stranger are, quite literally, 1 in a million.  It almost never happens.)  We take on the anxiety of others as our own, even though our own ability to affect the change is limited.\n2. We raised a whole generation with helicopter parents.  Beyond just participation trophies and everyone's a winner mentalities, we shielded an entire generation of kids from failures or risks of any kind.  We called teachers when the kids didn't do well in school, demanding the grades be changed.  We wouldn't let the kids go outside because of our fears they would be abducted.  We solved their problems with bullies or mean girls for them.  We did their projects for them.  As a result, they never learned to cope with failure or set-backs...and there is plenty of failure and set-backs in the real world as an adult.\n3. We oversold 4-year college to the same generation, while underselling things like plumbing, electrical work, mechanical work, carpentry.  And we doubled down by telling them that the name recognition of the college was paramount.  No wonder people are anxious when they graduate with $250K in student loans and they're unemployable because they got a degree in Gender Studies or English Literature.\n4. We are creating problems for ourselves.  The plastic straw thing is a perfect example.  While yes, using less plastic is better for the environment, this is where the government has focused its time and effort instead of in places like getting the homeless off the streets (for example).\n5. Others around us are anxious for the reasons listed above.  It's hard to be calm when everyone around you is anxious.  We're herd animals...when the herd spooks, we as individuals also spook.  But unlike most herd animals, someone in California can spook the herd in NYC using TV, radio, or internet.\n6. Finally, as always, people want the quick fix.  So they buy a book, or some pills, or do a single session with a yoga instructor or life coach.  I have news for you if you're one of the people buying these books - the books won't solve your problem alone.  You're going to have to do some work on yourself.",

The myth of all early deaths being preventable is causing us irreparable damage. \n\nOn your other point, failure is not well tolerated by the boomies \n\n3.The market is shit because prospective employees looked at factory wages and largely said \"fuck that\" and went to school. By all means try tradework, but it's suitable for less than 1% of the population and even they are not going to enjoy lung cancer, kidney disease and arthritis. \n\n4&amp;6. incentive is to placate, elected officials don't want to impose expensive and hard fixes that might fail. Particularly when half the country doesn't understand how anything actually works.",

With the way the news focuses on one thing at a time, it can be easy to forget the government isn\u2019t just one person who can only work on a single task. There\u2019s a section of the government specifically for working on things to help the environment (like the straws), and a completely separate group that works on things like helping the homeless. They can both be working to make things better at the same time!",

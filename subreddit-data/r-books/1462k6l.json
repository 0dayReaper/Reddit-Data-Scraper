I can (maybe I should say \u2018 I could\u2019) imagine scenes very well and pretty much make it feel as if I\u2019m in the book itself.\n\nIn fact, for the past 2 weeks, it seems like this ability was stronger than before somehow? I felt much more in touch and present in the story. These past 2-3 days things went wrong somewhere\n\nI was just about to finish re-reading a book in a favourite series of mine while also reading Pet Sematary by Stephen King. I was enjoying both. And then, I set both books down for just a day - I wasn\u2019t feeling that energetic and motivated to read (and also I\u2019d gotten to a part of Pet Sematary that bored me because I knew where it was going since I\u2019d watched the movie). Next day, I suddenly wasn\u2019t visualising the story and wasn\u2019t even able to focus. \n\nI somehow finished Pet Sematary and then picked up the next book in the series. Still nothing. And these are good books, well written with good descriptions. It\u2019s frustrating because I enjoy reading but it\u2019s not been fun when I can\u2019t visualise the stories\n\nAppreciate any advice!",

I\u2019ve consistently been getting too much sleep (10-11hrs) but been sleeping rather late (2 to 3am)\n\nI guess I didn\u2019t \u2018lose it overnight\u2019. I can still do it if I focus and try to visualise; It just doesn\u2019t flow by itself like this movie that just turns on when I start reading. and it\u2019s very erratic - it becomes very clear that i\u2019m consciously trying to imagine \n\nI\u2019m starting to think a reason it isn\u2019t working is because i\u2019m consciously thinking about it and trying to get it to start through sheer willpower even though i know that\u2019s not how it works - it\u2019s the frustration. \n\nseems like there\u2019s a bit more to it than this though\u2026 Kind of seems also that maybe I\u2019m just not interested in this book anymore? Maybe I need a break from reading as a whole? I\u2019ve been dreading reading this current book for a few days and only sort of \u2018recovered\u2019 from this dread today when I tried reading and realised the chapter was actually supposed to be enjoyable and something I would like (if I could visualise it)\n\nNot too sure really, i\u2019ve just been coming up with ideas for what might have happened myself",

            "comment": "Stress. Depression. Burnout. Etc.\n\nLook, some of these other posters saying loss of an ability is caused by stroke or something aren't wrong, but if you had a stroke or something life-altering, you wouldn't be posting about this weird thing related to visualizing worlds while reading, and it would be something you couldn't do any more (or couldn't do without re-learning to do with significant therapy). You'd very likely be in the hospital or have visited recently for a very pronounced illness or trauma.\n\nI just say that so you don't freak out. Internet advice is a breeding ground for hypochondria.\n\nI can also tell you that this is not uncommon; lots of people lose things like this from time-to-time, usually due to stress or depression. For my own part, I was fascinated by the written word and the music of poetic prose until recently when it just sort of stopped sounding as musical to my ear. I stopped reading. Stopped writing. It all just felt like work, and all the while, I was brokenhearted because this thing I loved so dearly just sort of died. Or so it seemed.\n\nMuch like you, I could force myself to do it if I really tried. Oh, but it was just a struggle to try, and I really didn't see the point; the love of it was gone. The need to feel it was gone. I told myself it might never come back, and why was I interested in it anyway? What good was it doing me? It certainly wasn't making me money, so why bother?\n\nColors were shades of gray. Food had no flavor. Life was a series of mechanical activities turned into some performative art, and I knew it would be by the slow, monotony of an unchanging world, filled with its 9-to-5 days that I would wither. Nothing mattered. That was my perception of life, and until it changed, nothing returned to me.\n\nYou need to de-stress. Take a break. Don't feel like you need to force yourself. If the visual doesn't come, it doesn't come. Try something else.\n\nIt will come back eventually. Be kind to yourself, and take care internet stranger :)",

Definitely agree with you on that front. (Would by lying if I didn\u2019t panic initially though hahah)\n\nThanks for sharing about your own experience with it. I relate completely. It\u2019s just really sad and frustrating when you aren\u2019t able to enjoy something that used to be a highlight of your day. For me, it\u2019s incredibly tough because the book I was reading when it fell apart is a personal all time favourite, it\u2019s part of a series of books that I deem my \u2018comfort\u2019 series. It takes place in a universe that I would imagine myself as a character in when I was a kid. \n\nI\u2019m now pretty certain that it\u2019s the stress and burnout. Just generally being tired of how things are and realising that in the short term they won\u2019t get better, and in the intermediate to long term, they will get harder at worst and uncertain at best. Maybe even some initial, minor stage of depression\u2026 I thought deeper and realised the day all this started was when something occured that royally pissed me off and ruined my mood for the entire day. It\u2019s clear now that I haven\u2019t recovered since then\u2026 \n\nGenuinely and truly appreciate your comment. I think it was exactly what I needed to hear. I\u2019m gonna take a break from\u2026 well, from most things and just sort of try doing something or the other. Thanks. This was helpful",

            "comment": "I think that's quite a big question, without narrowing it down to exactly what you want. I am especially interested in class politics, as well.\n\nEven today writers tend to be comfortable middle class and their characters often likewise, so while there may be financial issues mentioned, I don't know that they necc. register as anything like what most people face. I definitely find there's a lack of lower middle class perspectives in particular, especially given opportunities today. Publishers are of course also very likely to be very comfortable middle class. Critics and academics have also typically been, and it's only more recently academia has been more engaged with class issues - writers can still get away with, even be fawned over precisely for, their classism. Politically, writers often seem to skew Liberal, if that.\n\nI was toying cautiously with the idea of adding *Les mis* to my summer reading list earlier and remembering how much I almost always hate reading about 'peasants' as written by the higher classes (hoping French lit will be safer but def. haven't always found it so. I'm interested in the French revolution and of course there is the interest in class politics, and you do get somewhat middle-middle class views there, and to an extent just people who give the sense of being 'ordinary', but in the time period, it's extremely relative, they are often still priviliged comparatively. There's still infuriating pastoral ideal stuff but also those who won't put up with it).\n\nImo, the results are variable to disastrous. It's almost always condescending (often excruciatingly so) there's a delight in portraying dysfunction and bad choices as representative of the working class and a faux-sympathy that still secretly reassures wealthy middle class readers they are in fact more deserving (my own working class family can't read this stuff without heckling). When the focus is on individuals (incl. 'the rich should be nicer' instead of promoting systemic change), the issues often aren't portrayed as systemic and wide as they are in reality. It's not made to be as interesting as portrayals of educated people and more complex problems, with a greater understanding of their own problems - education and class being equated to a now absurd extent. Historically it also often doesn't accurately represent working class people's political understanding. I don't think I've seen much engagement with cultural issues holding the working classes back, either (as perhaps in Educating Rita, which highlights the difference the background of a writer can make). In American lit, working class men can be outright presented as associated with ideas of rugged masculinity and generally shitty macho behaviour, which seems to be going just fantastically.\n\nI think I've seen it done arguably well about once in a novel, in Edith Wharton's The Age of Mirth, but the focus is still an upper middle class character. Sartre's take is interesting, obviously class issues did interest him very much with his politics, there are politically aware working class characters in his work (and notable limits to the education of upper middle class characters) but while he doesn't have the disgust for the working class some of his characters do, I could well believe he was battling against it. Trollope is noted for being particularly interested in money - but I strongly encourage research to get a sense for the values. There's a larger range of classes than typical in his novels and interaction between them, but lower class characters while not necc. unsympathetic can still be more comic. The historical political corruption he highlights is something I feel all lower class people here in the UK should know of. Jude the Obscure is Hardy being Hardy so, eh. I'm sure I'm missing some good examples. Those who read more not dead/recent writers may well come up with ones closer to what you're after (for me 20th century is recent so there's a lot there, although I've yet to like or be really satisfied with pretty much any of it - the very middle class ostensibly socialist writers imo can be worse than the ones who aren't), though I'd encourage looking at the earlier history too.\n\nI'd still say try more leftwing (*not* modern Liberal) writers, but also that this doesn't mean it'll be handled perfectly or well at all.",

If you want some particularly great recs I'd recommend looking at the shortlists or longlists each year for the Financial Times Business Book Award of the Year. The titles you mention such as Freaknomics and The Big Short are actually non-fiction so I assume you're okay with that.",

Their authors were economic dilettantes who fitted their stories to popular economic paradigms of their times. Our own time does not yet have such a paradigm, hence my sympathy for the thoughts of Amphy 64 above. I'm looking for narratives that have a more sophisticated reading of the recent/current economy without relying on older paradigms. It's a research project.",

    "postText": "I'll go first.\n\nShirley Jackson\n\nI've just finished The Haunting of Hill House, and I cannot stand the way she writes her characters. The women feel almost like a parody of victorian era women, who don't like to leave the house and like to frolic in the garden, meanwhile the men feel hollow and boring. \n\nI also read We Have Always Lived In The Castle, and the characters in that were much worse, that entire book was about two sisters who wanted to sit around all day and prepare lunch and drink tea.\n\nI understand that a lot of these characteristics come from Shirley's own struggles with agoraphobia, and anxiety, and that the characters are inspired by aspects of herself, however just because there's a conscious creative choice there, it doesn't mean it's a good choice. I've never felt more bored while reading characters interacting",

They feel so close to being magical but then somewhere it tends to lose it. I always am left feeling\u2026 emotional unsatisfied? Unfulfilled? I can\u2019t put a finger on what it is. \n\nThe only work I liked was Good Omens but I suspect I enjoyed Pratchett\u2019s influence more than Gaiman\u2019s.",

King is my favourite writer!\n\nHowever I do concede that The Gunslinger wasn't a great book, he first wrote the book when he was 16, and then just polished it before publishing it later on. However the second book onwards is pretty great.\n\nSome of Kings best work is his non-horror stuff. Incase you're interested, I'd recommend Different Seasons (That contains the stories that Shawshank Redemption and Stand By Me are based on) The Green Mile, and 11/22/63 (Time travel love story revolving around the JFK assassination)\n\nHowever if King just isn't for you, that's cool, you can enjoy what you enjoy!",

Then he goes out, finds the object he needs to fix the problem, and then describes in detail AGAIN all the steps he is taking. We don't need the same details TWICE. It got to the point where I was sick of his chapters and wanted to read about what was happening on Earth. I enjoyed the book enough when I read it, but the more I thought about it, the less I liked. When the group decides to go back and find him, one of the characters has doubts about whether to go back. It's what a five year journey? but the woman I believe says we left him, so we're all gonna go find him so they all end up going. It would've been more interesting if the character did not go. Add a little more conflict and some interesting things to think about. \nI don't think it is a good representative of the science fiction genre. I appreciate the, from what I gather, very accurate details. It is a survival story that introduces few ideas to think about, and when has the chance to do something more, does not. \nI did not read any more of his. I hear Artemis is bad, and Project Hail Mary sounds like he uses the same Martain formula. \n\nI read half of Dark Matter on my Kindle phone app. I realize I hate reading books on an app and stopped.

I'm sure this won't prove to be particularly popular here, since everyone on this sub seems to think Cormac McCarthy is the greatest writer of all time, but I also find his writing style distracting. Some dude on goodreads said that he can't decide if he wants to be Hemingway or Faulkner, and I find that very apt - his prose veers weirdly between these super detailed and extremely flat descriptions of something like opening a door, and these melodramatic, pseudo-biblical pronouncements. I guess you could argue that this mashup *is* the style, but I find it very uneven. \n\nAlso, I don't think just something being disturbing makes it interesting or meaningful. But I think it's the weird biblical writing that has people somehow convinced that hundreds of pages of unremitting gore is Deep.",

The Handmaid's Tale in specific is a great example. Nothing like hearing another woman getting just a bit too much into explaining how she is imagining herself in that situation and how awful it would be. (Yes, this happened to me in real life, and before anyone starts, I am a woman as well.)",

I think the near future dystopia she describes in the first Mad Adam book is not outlandish at all, almost reality already in many places, very insightful into human behavior,  skillfully written etc. In the end though, I think her ideal \"solutions\" are not what I agree with but there's nothing laughable about it and I think she's working on a deeper level than she gets credited for, again bc most people only read Handmaid.",

Just as I haven't read everything written by Stephen King. The question was what author that other people love, do you personally not care for( in regards to what you have read yourself. Not, what author's work did you read absolutely all of and then decided that their work was not good enough?). I have read a lot of Stephen King's books and attempted to make my way through a few more. But no, I haven't read everything that he has written.  And I understand that a lot of people love his work. It just doesn't sit right with me. It's the same thing for Margret Atwood. I haven't read all of her work by any means. I simply meant that I did not enjoy the books that I did read. Even though they came highly recommended by basically everyone I know. I'm sure she has stories that are vastly different from what I have read thus far, and that I might enjoy much more.",

People watch / read Fight Club and think the Pitt character (don't remember his name) is cool but the point is that the real guy had to grow up, become less selfish, find meaning in others, and destroy the Pitt alter ego from himself before he could be a real whole person with even a name. It does a good job of describing what it feels like to be a sort of alienated young man from within the perspective of that same alienated young man, and guys like that do have masculine bro fantasies- the sort of cool guy they want to be or think they could be if not for X grievance keeping them down. But you as a reader should be looking at all that critically, see the characters growth. For some reason, a lot of (usually young and inexperienced) readers / viewers just take that perspective at face value and I honestly don't get how they interpret the plot then unless it's just sociopathic? Weird.\n\nBut it's a decent book and a fun read if you take it on it's on merits and ignore some of the fanboys. You know, it's like how a few years ago it was common for a certain kind if young man to think Scarface the character was a cool aspirational figure. A lot of people don't understand how to enjoy a character in a good work while also thinking of how the world of the work isn't exactly as the character perceives it. Sad because that makes the work way less interesting.",

The aliens are basically humans, except their society is a little funny and they are unisexual.\n\nBut the society as its described just doesn't really make sense to me, so I got annoyed reading descriptions that I thought simply didn't make sense, and whatever interesting points there were just got undermined because of that.\n\nIe, there's people who can accurately see the future, and will answer your questions for you as long as they are specific. And apparently nobody has thought of a way to put this to use for military purposes.\n\nAnd in fact, despite the kingdom that the main character visits having managed to conquer half of the planet, they somehow don't understand what a war is, and have apparently never fought any. Despite the fact that they very much resemble a European kingdom, and they have a border with another country, and have smaller groups within the nation. If a nation like that didn't have a functional military it would cease to exist just from internal pressures, let alone external ones.\n\nAnd so if the book doesn't seem interesting b/c I just have the urge to poke holes in the world rather than try to understand it, and its not particularly fast paced  and seems more interesting in building up this world that I find uninteresting, there's just no reason for me to read it. \n\nKind of reminds me of Never Let Me Go, most of the criticisms I just listed are basically true of that book as well, but at least that book was more interesting to read even if everyone's behavior was unrealistic.",

But in both cases, the criticism you name isn't a flaw of the book. In both cases, you might want to lean into the things you notice and ask why the author wrote it that way because it's not like they did it unintentionally. That's when the depth and beauty of both novels really unfolds. But as I said, if you don't find that interesting then there's absolutely no reason to pursue it, but a lot of the questions you asked are the beginning parts of some pretty interesting thoughts and discussions. Both of those authors know what they are doing.",

Doing that is only interesting if the differences make logical sense, at least in my opinion. Obviously not everyone agrees with me, but from my perspective the lack of consistency is a flaw.",

But the world in that book is a part of her Hainish Cycle, and the choices she made which seem inconsistent to you are deliberate, all of the questions you raise (especially about war and foretelling and power balances) are intentional and digging into them is the starting place of those thought experiments. She's exploring political and cultural questions from them. Again, perfectly fine for your response to be \"meh not interested\" or even \"seems silly\", it's not for everyone. But it's just objectively not true that these things are flaws, in the sense that the author didn't make an error, you have not discovered some inconsistency that she didnt' realize, etc.\n\nYears ago I had a friend who told me she hated the Island of Dr Moreau because the science involved in creating life like that was bullshit. It's a similar thing here. It's fine to not enjoy the book or think it's silly, but since Wells wasn't attempting to write a scientific treatise in the first place, this is not a flaw.  \n\n\nETA The point of NLMG isn't about individuals as opposed to society. People live within a society and act in accordance, you can't really separate them. You, the reader, have to look over their shoulder and see the things they don't. All Ishiguro is this way bw.",

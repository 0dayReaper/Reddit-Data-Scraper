    "postText": "So I'm not sure where to begin this post but I'll start off with that I've been visually impaired for almost a decade now.  Reading books without the aid of magnification is almost impossible and as a kid who grew up reading everything I could get my hands on it was kind of depressing as my condition slowly progressed.\n\nI ended up getting a kindle and that was great for awhile, I could read on the bus and increase the font size and it was great.  I could read a little bit every day on my way to work or to school and it was great.  But then as time progressed I started to lose even more of my vision and it became more and more difficult to focus my eyes and stay on track with the kindle.\n\nI started using audible last year and it really was a gamechanger for me, I was burning through a book a week and I had years of reading to catch up on.  I told everyone about my new 'hobby' and it wasn't until my brother recommended the app \"Libby\" to me that my life truly changed.  It's like audible, but FREE.  I'm sure other people have talked about the app before on this subreddit but I'm still telling everyone I talk to who reads about this app.\n\nI still can't get over how easy it is to use, how I've been able to read hundreds of dollars worth of books in a couple months for free from the public library AND get amazing recommendations from them as well.  Sure there's a bit of a wait list, but after using the app for a month it's hard not to build up a small catalogue of books on hold that are automatically delivered to your phone on a weekly basis.\n\nAnyway, I couldn't be more excited to be able to immerse myself in  books again.  These last few months have really been a gamechanger for me, I've been able to catch up on almost a decade of reading and I don't plan on stopping for awhile.",

                            "comment": "Libby basically works the way that a physical book does: the library purchases access to a certain number of books, and one patron at a time can check out each book. If the book is checked out, you have to wait until someone returns it. With Hoopla, every book is always available, and the library pays each time a patron checks a book out. There's a limit to how many books each patron can check out a month from Hoopla. At my library, it's 10, and I have literally never hit the limit.\n\nIn my experience, Hoopla has a way more eclectic catalog than Libby. For instance, I want to read *Lolly Willowes*, Sylvia Townsend Warner's 1926 feminist classic about a middle-aged spinster who gets sick of being treated as a domestic drudge by her extended family and decides to move to the country and enter into a sexual relationship with Satan. (Because really, who wouldn't want to read that? Also, the book about the devil-fucking spinster was the Book of the Month Club's first selection, which delights me.) It's not on Libby, and the library doesn't have a hard copy, but Hoopla has it in e-book and audiobook formats.  Generally speaking, I would say that Libby is more likely to have recent, popular books, and Hoopla is more likely to have random older stuff and recent niche books.",

So the library selects the titles. Hoopla is a subscription service, like Netflix. The library doesn\u2019t select the titles, hoopla does. What that means, is that hoopla will have a larger selection, but Libby will be more reflective of local reading habits in your community. That\u2019s why most libraries have both.",

You\u2019ll have people in the Friends who have been volunteering and working at the library for 40 years, and a brand new director gets brought in who doesn\u2019t know the community at all and starts making bad decisions\u2026 The Friends do push back.\n\n(I can see this also working against change, but that certainly has been our experience in our town. I particularly enjoyed the Director insisting that the YA section needed a couch *that would not be visible from the main desk*. On the bright side, while the Director ignored the Friends pointing out how stupid this was, the endless stream of teens coming to tell the staff that adults were sleeping/shooting up/masturbating on the couch did take care of it eventually.)",

Great examples are Roy Avers reading Gene Wolf's Book of the New Sun series. Avers also does the first 3 books in A Song of Ice and Fire. Erik Sandvold does a fantastic job with two of Tad Williams' series, Otherland and Memory, Sorrow and Thorn. He also does a reading of the Harry Potter series for those of you who don't like Jim Dale or Stephen Fry.",

I\u2019m reading Murderbot Diaries right now and the next audiobook in the series was 25 weeks out because so many others had requested it. So I bought that one so I didn\u2019t have to wait.\n\nAlso a ton of times I\u2019ll request a book on a whim and by the time I get it, I\u2019ve forgotten why I wanted to read it. Or I\u2019ll have a week without any books and then suddenly I\u2019ll have six come up at once. \n\nI love it and I love libraries but I still like to have books myself and not have to read them based off someone else\u2019s schedule",

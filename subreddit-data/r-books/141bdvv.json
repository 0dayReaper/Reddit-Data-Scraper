Realized I didn't have a good answer for that so maybe it's time to sell or donate them?\n\nSo I'll pitch the question to you: why not just get rid of every book you haven't touched in a year or two? What does your own collection mean to you and why do you keep it around? Would love to hear others' thoughts on this.",

I love collecting books, being able to call them my own, arranging them how I like and having a visual representation of all the stories that I've read and enjoyed or the stories I want to read in the future. \n\nPeople say that reading books and buying books are two different hobbies and I agree with that. Not everyone who loves reading also loves having a lot of books as well, a lot of people read from the library/on Kindle/or keep only the books that they think they will reread in the future. Others like to keep every book they've read because that's what makes them happy. \n\nFor me, the point of having a personal library is simply that I love my books and I want to have a big and beautiful collection. I find happiness in my little hobby and in being surrounded by books. Not everything has to have a deep meaning behind it, doing something just because you like it is a good enough reason.",

Having the only reading they are exposed to be assigned in school is a sure way to turn kids off of reading and kids imitate behavior that is modeled at home - if adults in the house read for fun regularly, the kids will more than likely adopt that habit too.\n\nAnd like you mentioned, young kids don't differentiate adults reading on their phone/tablet from adults scrolling social media or watching videos on their phone/tablet. The physical books are important. It's also been shown that kids who read more develop better language and writing skills, purely from reading, and it doesn't matter *what* they are reading (it doesn't have to be the classics or be educational), just that they are reading written text. And there's other research showing that reading comprehension and information retention is higher when reading on paper versus screens (even paperwhite screens).\n\nSo yea, a big part of why I keep my books is for my kids, so that they will grow up with that example and those opportunities",

A bookshelf that occupies maybe three square feet (1/4 square meter) can hold a hundred books. Built-in bookshelves are more efficient still, and certainly beat a blank wall.",

Many people would say that a personal physical library has never had any relevance, even less so in the day of digital media.\n\nPersonally I like having my modest little library around me.  My attic has been converted to shelving along all the walls, two window nooks for sitting in, and a double row of shelves down the center of the attic.  I've got about 3k-ish books.  When I read, I enjoy sitting in one of the window nooks, having the warmth of the sun on me in a cool room, my tea beside me as well as the scent and sight of all my books at hand.\n\nI like the visual appeal of all my books, both from an atavistic and avarice perspective.  I also enjoy rereading some of my books, or having them available to physically lend to people.  When I have guests the books frequently provide a conversation point.\n\nHowever....  Books do take up some space.  I move not infrequently, and moving the books is a hassle.  They weigh a good bit, especially once you get past a few hundred of them.  In all honesty, I've slow down my acquisition of physical copies.  Now I only pick up physical copies of books when it's an author I know and love, so I want to give them the fullest financial support which I can, or it's a book I'll be referencing a great deal.  I find it's easier to study or work with a book in physical form rather than digital if I want to retain what's in the material.  If I just need something for reference purposes, a PDF is far faster to search and use.\n\nI have several times the number of digital books than physical ones, because of space, cost and convenience concerns.  I read constantly when I travel or even just waiting in line at places, so having digital books is very useful.\n\nFriends of mine with significant book collections have downsized recently.  Their criteria has been mixed but the primary focus has been:  Do they love the author?  Is it a book they have or will want to reread?  Is there a sentimental value to the book?\n\nIf they answered 'no' to all of those they've often donated to a friend, a public library, or other book source.",

Pick out something that depending on your mood or that catches your eye. Plop down on a chair. Review/re-read your non-fictions. Go through your markings, notes, and whatnot. And then pick out a related book from your library to see how they connect. And then there is just the collectible, nostalgic, adornment aspect of a library: to see all your favorite paper books lined up on the shelves. Some of them have attractive covers and some of them are worn and yellowed - all are deeply personal and valuable.

            "comment": "About five or so years ago, I had a turning point and went through a great book purge.  I decided I had far too many books sitting on my shelf collecting dust, many of them there for no other reason than I thought they made me look smart, or lying to myself that I would actually get around to reading it, or old books from college (I'd graduated about ten years, give or take, before that) that I would never read again (looking at you specifically, *Middlemarch*).\n\nMy bookcases were overflowing, not pretty to look at, disorganized, and just a mess.\n\nI plowed through the stack of TBR not even filed/put away, and went through with an iron fist: I will only allow a book to stay on my shelf if I will re-read it at least twice.  There is no timeline on that; I don't re-read Lord of the Rings  every year like some, but I will read it again multiple times in the future (I'm 37, I've got a lot of reading years left), so it stays.  But if ever I look at a book and say, \"No, I won't actually re-read this again.\" Then it goes.\n\nIt was incredibly freeing.  I've always been good at purging my other possessions as needed, but books were somehow sacred, even if I didn't care much about the individual book.  Not anymore.\n\nI kind of like anyone who does come over, if they check out my bookshelves, they will see a very tailored selection of me and my tastes in reading (which is, all over the place for the most part).  \n\nI just did another mini-purge and pulled a whole box (in conjunction with a house-wide purge which was also incredibly freeing and so much organization, I'm in heaven).  I now have room to grow on my shelves, because over time there will be more I that meet that criteria.\n\nI library as much as I can especially for the first read, because otherwise I'd be buying books to get rid of them after one read.  If I get it from the library and fall in love, then I can go buy a copy.  \n\nThat all said, everyone has a different criteria for what makes them happy.  I have friends who having bookcases upon bookcases stuffed with books is what they love, and it makes them happy, so they do it.  I have friends who have majority switched to Kindle and are happy as clams with their decision.  This makes me happy, so I do this.  \n\nI think the main point is- if it does \"spark joy\" to use the now-joke colloquial term, then there's nothing wrong with it, but when it doesn't, then just because it's a book doesn't make it special.  And whatever sparks joy is incredibly individual.",

And in this increasingly technology oriented age it seems like a decidedly bad and ill conceived idea to let big tech be in control of the digital formats that in the future will be the only source for varying information.  Nowadays some older books are even having their text altered in current printings if certain material is deemed problematic in some way.  If you have the originals then you can physically open the book up and look at the text that might not even exist anymore in its current presentations.  And any dystopian novel that involves literature in some way (Fahrenheit and Brave New World being two of the most prominent examples) rightly notes that the disappearing of books need not be limited in scope, things like Shakespeare and the classic canons will be disappeared just the same as philosophy or theology or science or anything else.  If you own the books then you always have physical access to that information.",

Especially moving it becomes a calculation of do I like this book or book series enough to box it up and lug it somewhere else.\n\nEdit: Also it's worth it to mention that as convenient as e-readers are you can lose your account and all your books in one fell swoop because of bullshit. Then there's nothing you can do about it because you agreed to the terms and conditions for the e-reader which essentially states your \"ownership\" of the books is temporary and depends on if you remain in good standing with the company.",

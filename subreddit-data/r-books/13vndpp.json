    "postText": "I'm an avid reader. Always have been. My wife? She might read a book a year. I'm on #6 for 2023. \n\nAs an English teacher, being with her has been such an insight into why people might not read so consistently. It's showed me that, on one end, reading, especially novels, is very much a hobby like any other. But it's also shown me that reading is an activity and a pleasure that is very much cultivated by guardians or parents in childhood. Might seem like an obvious truth, but as the old saying goes, many obvious truths hide in plain sight. \n\nIf anything, these realizations have made me a little more empathetic to those who don't read. I think there is a tendency in the book community to be a little pretentious when it comes to reading and what kind of people do and don't. \n\nAnyway, curious to see what the experience of others is here!\n\nEdit: a couple of things I wanted to remark upon. \n\nFirst, I really didn't expect this to blow up like it is! Wow. \n\nTwo, I recognize now that being introduced to reading as a child is not always predictive of someone continuing to read well into adulthood. \n\nThree, there is a lot of complexity out there, both with regards to how and what people read, as well as what people like or don't like in relationships. This thread fully solidifies my current beliefs: it's subjective and up to taste. We have to be understanding of one another!",

I've never been an avid reader, but in college (a decade ago at this point...fuck), I picked up the Hunger Games and was immediately obsessed, and for like 3-4 years, I was reading a lot. And I enjoyed it! \n\nBut ever since I really got into adult life, aka having a 9-5, raising a kid, being married, finding time to work out, cooking, cleaning, etc....my time has just shrunk so much. And I love making music more than anything, so typically, my free time is either going to making music or playing a game at night in bed, because playing a game is mindless and sometimes, I need mindless to end the day.\n\nBut that's the habit I really need to break. It's like I so want to read, but I get overwhelmed just finding a book and starting. There's so many options at the tip of my fingers (I have a kindle that my wife reads on alllll the time), I feel anxious if I waste my \"free\" time trying to find a book I won't even know if I'll like. The one book I've been waiting on for years is the fucking Winds of Winter, so joke is on me for that one. But that is one I would drop everything to read. I need to find a series to kickstart my love of reading again. \n\nAnyone else going through the same!?",

So it's an excuse for us to read together, a first for both of us :)\n\nAs OP mentioned, I do think it needs to be cultivated by parents and peers. I want to do that for my kids.\n\nWe've done the Roald Dahl series, the first two Winnie the Pooh books, The Hobbit, among others. I still struggle to read a book on my own. I'd like to get through The Lord of the Rings, I just think my reading speed needs to improve. \n\nAnyway, I'll keep at it with my kids and hopefully I'll get there one day too.\n\nThanks for your kind words and suggestions.",

Fantasy isn't really my genre in general so I'm struggling to think of good options for you that would have a similar feel to Lord of the Rings but a recent classic is the Hunger Games :)",

Dan Brown rightly gets a lot of shit, but his first few books (the Da Vinci code especially) are great light reads. Absolutely silly and bonkers, but they move really quickly and are good page turners.\n\nThe other author I would always recommend to people trying to get back to reading (I had fallen away from reading until a few years ago) is Michael Crichton books. The dude writes pretty one dimensional characters but his stories are nearly always fun, and slightly grounded and always interesting. The obvious choice for first Crichton books would be Jurassic Park, the Lost World, Congo and maybe Prey?",

If a book doesn't catch my attention I just never finish it.  I also tend to over do it when it's something I really like.  This leads to burn out and very long rest periods.  Also doesn't help that I'm dyslexic and often have to reread passages just to remember what the heck I just read.  Ho eatly reading can be very mentally taxing for me.

It's been a while, but I believe I had to sort of \"train\" my brain for it.  I started with books I'd read before, and remembered enough of the story that if I did space out, it was not a big deal, and I had an idea of how far to back up in the story.  \n\nFor me, I need to be doing a task that I can do on autopilot, like folding laundry, vacuuming, washing dishes, certain crafting activities.  Driving tends to work well for me, too.  On the flip side, there are MANY activities I cannot combine audiobooks or podcasts with.  Grocery shopping and trying to listen is generally a futile effort with me, as I'm often comparing prices, trying to find something specific, it just takes more of my brain's bandwidth.\n\nAll that said, there are certainly books I've given up on, that I might try at another time, or if it ever gets another narrator that clicks well with me.  \n\nGood luck in your literary journey!",

If he'd said \"spend\" instead of \"waste\" and \"...when you could get them from the library instead\", then it would have been fine.  You know, be frugal in how you spend your money and all of that.  But to say that spending money on books was a waste - especially when it was my money that didn't have anything to do with him.   No.  That was the moment I started to understand how different our values were and that this relationship wasn't going to be good long term.

I\u2019d say my husband is kind of a reader, in that he values reading and wishes it were something he had more drive to do lately. But he\u2019s probably only read a handful of books in the past five years, and most of those were related to games or shows and such. That said, he does have a healthy mix of hobbies. He spends plenty of time watching Wondrium lectures, learning a language, deep diving into new topics, etc., so he\u2019s often doing intellectual things that just aren\u2019t sitting down to read a book. \n\nSo I think maybe a better answer from me is that I couldn\u2019t maintain a relationship with someone who wasn\u2019t into generally intellectual pursuits. It doesn\u2019t have to be all they do, of course - I spend tons of time watching Real Housewives and playing farming sims.

I'm of the opinion that some people are just born with the desire to read while others have learned to love to read and yet others will never embrace it.  \n\nAlthough I feel people benefit in many ways by reading, I don't believe books are the only way to get those same benefits. I've always encouraged people to lean into their natural tendencies and get clear on why they want to do an activity and that they don't need to defend their choices.",

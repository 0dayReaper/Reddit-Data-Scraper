    "postText": "Animal Farm by George Orwell and The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho are two books that are remarkably concise yet have always managed to leave a lasting impression on my mind. Animal Farm, a satirical allegory, masterfully unveils the dangers of totalitarianism and the corruption of power. The Alchemist is a very short book, but it truly helps those who are on the verge of giving up on their dreams and inspires them to persist in pursuing their dreams until they come true.\n\n\nI'm curious about your perspective.  Have you encountered any short books that have made a lasting impact on you?",

            "comment": "\"Our Souls at Night\" by Kent Haruf is the absolute first that pops into my mind- it made me cry the first time I read it. But thinking a bit more about it.... Japanese literature has quite a few that I really like, most of them broadly from the 20th century.\n\nOff the top of my head, there's \"Snow Country\" by Kawabata, \"The Box Man\" and \"The Woman in the Dunes\" by Kobo, \"Kappa\" by Akutagawa, \"A Pale View of Hills\" by Kazuo Ishiguro is a bit more modern, but it's still fairly short and impactful.... There are so many, but looking into those and the ones around them is definitely a start! :)\n\nI also really liked \"Kneller's Happy Campers\" by Etgat Keret, that one is from Israel, but it's a pretty bizarre, fun little book that you can easily read in like an hour, and I'm sure both Garcia Marquez's \"Chronicles of a Death Foretold\" and Martha Wells' Murderbot Diaries have also been mentioned several times by now, lol. Oh, and Robert Bloch's \"Psycho\" is kind of a classic if you're at all into horror, and I'm reading \"Women Talking\" by Miriam Toews right now, so far it's really interesting!\n\nA personal little pet favorite of mine is one by Kl\u00e1ra Feh\u00e9r, and the title roughly translates to \"Back in my day...!\". I don't believe an English translation exists, it's an old Hungarian novelette aimed at girls 14-16-ish, and it's... very surprisingly emotional. Even as an adult, it made me tear up. (Spoiler alert, it's a teenage romance set during WWII.)",

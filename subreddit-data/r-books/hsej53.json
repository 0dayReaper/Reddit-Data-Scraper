I think it could be perceived as overblown and as mere revenge from critics, but my great-grandfather was similar in some ways to Fred, and after he died, his three children inherited money, and my grandfather lorded it over my father (his only child) and used it to force my dad to comply to many things he didn\u2019t want to. In my childhood the phrase \u201che could disinherit you\u201d was commonplace. My parents were very careful to make sure we knew what was appropriate and not appropriate in front of my grandfather for fear of retribution. In fact, my grandfather was beloved by many who didn\u2019t know what an actual horror he was at home. He used to say grandiose statements and would blatantly lie and double down on those lies every time. My point is that I think people who have not experienced someone like Fred or Donald first hand might find it hard to believe, but for me, it was chilling.",

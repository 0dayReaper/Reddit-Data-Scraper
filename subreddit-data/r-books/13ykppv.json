    "postText": "Recently I absolutely devoured \"Negative Space\" by B.R. Yeager in two days while listening to a Spotify playlist I found (it's called \"negative space by b r yeager altered my brain 4ever\" by kaiser, in case anyone is interested, it's an amazing atmospheric companion to the book) and it's so crazy to me how now I can't really go back and listen to the playlist without being instantly transported to the dark world of the book. \nIt's a little sad since I really enjoyed some songs, but now they seem to be haunted by the story, bringing up a lot of melancholic feelings, and that's also insanely interesting to me, how some books can appear as ghosts in not only music, but also people, places, smells, stages of life, etc. \nThis book is particularly intense, but still, the feeling of traveling somewhere in my mind the second any of those songs plays, how cool is that? \nJust wanted to share this, hoping maybe someone would feel the same!",

It\u2019s something I really love! Listening to a song or album and being transported back to a specific place, time, or experience feels like magic. I don\u2019t know all of the science behind the memory formation section of the brain and the part that processes or responds to music, but they seem so intensely intertwined.",

And yeah as much as I like some of those OSTs it always gives me such strong memories of the story it's hard to actually listen to them. \n\nHowever with normal books I just find songs distracting if I try to listen to them, I just can't do it. I've tried a few times and I always shut it off so I can actually focus on reading",

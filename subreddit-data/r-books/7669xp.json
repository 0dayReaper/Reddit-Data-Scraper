    "postText": "So, I was talking to my wife and the subject came to library cards and how she had one. I mention I didn't really see the point, if I'm going to pay for a book I'd rather own it, I say. She gives me a strange look but just brushes the remark off.\n\nLater, somebody is talking about libraries on reddit and how they are so great. I said that, while the selection is great, amazon is much better.\n\n\"Yeah but you have to pay for them on Amazon\"\n\nAnd thats when some gears started turning. \n\nSo I started looking into it. Turns out, for years I've always, mistakingly, though that, while the card was free, you had a rental fee to pay whenever you rent the books. I always figured that if I'm going to pay a fee to rent them, I would rather pay a little extra and keep them without worrying about late fees. Saves money, can read at my own place, and has led to a respectable book shelf.\n\nTurns out I was wrong. So so wrong.\n\nI had no idea the books were free. I went to the library the very next day and got a card. Then I find out I can rent the books online and have them delivered to my kindle!\n\nThis is a complete game changer and I feel so foolish for not realizing this sooner!",

Book clubs, yoga, they host 5 and 10ks all the time (a rail trail passes directly in front of it). They can even ordet books from othet libraries. Super useful. They even rent out comics and videogames. If you're an adult, you can fill out an optional book review to be entered in a drawing to win stuff. ",

Isn't that what Google is for?\"\n\nI HAVE NEVER BEEN SO WRONG. \nApparently, search engines cannot replace the magic of librarians. I was working on an important paper and had spent HOURS searching for scholarly articles that supported my findings on a topic that proved particularly difficult to find adequate sources on. I was so frustrated and even though I figured I'd just be given a generic response pointing in the directions I had looked in a hundred times already, I decided to give it a shot. \n\nThis woman was a genie I tell you. \nIn five minutes, I had a list of 10 sources with exactly what I was looking for. \nSharon was a goddamn genius and I will never doubt a librarian again.

Every system is different, I'm sure, but you can check the policy. Also, if you were 16, it was probably not an adult card, and the parent or guardian who got it for you would be responsible for it, not you. Case in point- if it was my system, and you walked in with that, and we pulled it up and saw it, we would mark that account as N/A (because it would have expired when you were 18) and have you get an adult card. The person who got you the card would be responsible for the lost books, not you. Now, if you wanted to pay for them, we would let you, but you could get your adult card and check out and never have to worry about it. \n\n",

I went a few times with my mother and grandma when I was little but due to limited selection and few other types of media, it wasn't worth the effort.\n\nIn the last few years the community college sort of *absorbed* the library and made it a part of its campus and started feeding it funding which lead to a HUGE redesign of it.

For ebooks and other digital media, libraries form groups and have a limited license to loan out materials for periods of time between patrons of all their libraries. \n\nSo even if your library is an old run down situation there are some pretty good resources in there.

A lot of them were funded by Andrew Carnegie and other rich people wanting to use their funds to better the poor who could not afford a private education and the children of immigrants to learn English.  Purchasing reflected that: classic literature, histories, science books, etc.  The idea that they should contain popular current literature or other media is relatively new.   \n\nWith limited funding libraries have to focus on what will endure.  So their movie selection will probably heavily feature children titles and classics/dramatic works.  If you want them to carry more, they need more money.  Campaign for higher local taxes AND for the library to have an revenue stream separate from the local county budget.  (We got that passed here and boy did it make a difference when the county could no longer raid the library budget.)  ",

It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everybody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kind of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time, I'll bring it back late. Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?\"",

A very large number of people have no idea that getting a Library card is free for residents, and the only thing you will ever pay for are related to loss/damage, overdue fees, or expired holds.\n\nIt's even more crazy when we do community outreaches. Kids, teens, and even adults have no idea that the library offers DVDs, videogames, and books free of charge provided you take care of them and return them on time.\n\nIt's a problem we're really struggling with right now in my neck of the woods because we have huge sections of the population that have been misled into thinking the library is an inconvenient service.",

Or adult films, which predators use to lure and stimulate children.\n\nReading books to kids with supervision is not grooming.",

They have led events, acted as historians, and advocated for LGBTQ+ rights. \n\nLGBTQ+ families wanted something that they could enjoy as a family. It was getting difficult to actually see positive representation of queer families and identities. Drag queens thought to entertain children and queer families with books that included and reflected them. Ally families wanted their children to also experience this. So that's drag queen story time - drag queens reading inclusive stories to kids and families.\n\nQueer adults have also experienced a lot of emotional abuse and confusion growing up. We either didn't have any representation or largely negative representation. Personally, I didn't know of gay people/ really hear anything about gay people. It was quite isolating growing up and confusing as I was navigating puberty and not understanding what was going on/why I was different. These kind of stories help kids grow up more empathetic and understanding. It may help a struggling youth understand their emotions and hopefully lead to a new generation of LGBTQ folks that aren't riddled with anxiety.\n\nDrag is part of our community. So is non traditional gender expression. Drag queens can celebrate this aspect - thus Drag Queen story time. It's not \"dress up\" story time as that makes it seem like it's simply just costume play. \n\nTo answer the other posters responding to you as well, drag itself is not inherently sexual. Like all other forms of performance, they can tailor their performance to the audience. Daytime drag at a library is going to be different than a club performance. This is true of actors that perform in children's movies and in adult movies. The Rock says different things depending on who he is performing for.\n\nIt's also quite hypocritical to focus on drag queens reading to kids as inherently sexual and predatory. Sporting events have cheerleaders, car shows will always have scantily clad people show off cars, pop music blaring on the radio at the mall will be quite explicit, Hooters, etc. These aren't causing the same moral outrages that we are now seeing. Plus you know, the weekly discovery of either some youth pastor, sports coach, or Republican that has been arrested for child porn or similar charge.",

Of this, I\u2019m mainly referring to the conservative side to defund them.\n\nYou will 100% not get a rational answer to this on any sub on reddit.\n\n&gt;Second, why drag queen reading hour?  I get being inclusive, but doesn\u2019t \u201cdrag queen\u201d kinda insinuate more\u2026adult topics?\n\nAt this point, knee jerk ism from the left in response to knee jerk ism on the right.\n\nEdit; the answer to the first question is this: the unholy combination of moral outrage and small government libertarianism that formed the Republican party in the first place. Not the \"Herr Durr, stick it to the liberals/own the libs\" answer everywhere outside conservative reddit loves (ie, the no rational answer)",

I\u2019d heard that a lot of people don\u2019t like the ending but I can\u2019t see why. I think it\u2019s a great ending for a fantastic series with my only complaint being the \u2018thee\u2019 and \u2018thou\u2019 dialogue because I absolutely fucking hated it. \n\n\nWhat did you think of the ending? If you hated it what would you have done instead?",

But it was better than the ending I expected and feared.  \n  We knew not all of the ka tet would make it to the tower, if any did at all.  By the end of The Wastelands I was starting to worry that Roland would almost make it but die right before.  After Wizard and Glass I was really worried about that now that we were really invested in Roland more than ever.  Roland was a hero. Even dressed up like him for Halloween as a kid in the 80s.\n  In time after the initial shock wire off, and having time to reflect I\u2019m satisfied with the ending.  Roland reached the tower and made it inside.  There were clues in many of the books that didn\u2019t make sense at the time of first reading that fat marked off as time is funny and the edges of the worlds are blurred.  \n  This was the only way for the Dark Tower saga to conclude.  Or has it?  What all has changed this time?  Does Roland still fall asleep on the beach and loose the fingers from his smart hand this time?  Does he draw the same three?  What happens on this next journey?  The only thing that really hasn\u2019t changed is Roland\u2019s relentlessness towards reaching the tower.  Who knows where the story goes from here.  Someday King may extend Roland\u2019s quest and see where this altered story line or new beam takes him.  \n  But for now the Gunslinger follows.",

Barlow was a terrifying mother fucker.). IT gets killed by children\u2019s imagination, \u201cStand Flagg\u201d has issues with his magic and is tricked/taken out by two different individuals who are intellectually disabled. I\u2019ve always thought that this was because King likes to mock evil, that when you shine a light in the true evils of the world they end up being just silly human things, greed, fear, hate, and short-sighted power grabs. Or maybe he just kinda sucks at writing endings sometimes.",

There's always been an element of the cyclical in such stories, the major difference in King's work is that he kept the same protagonist instead of making the cycle be some sort of mentor-mentee/father-son affair. I also feel that it's a lot easier to accept the ending if you have read the series after all the books had been published. I can definitely see and understand how someone who has been reading the series from when the first book was published would find it frustrating. Personally, I wish King would continue the series but then again, I suppose that's what fanfiction is for.",

Ka is a wheel, the book told you it was going to be this way all along.\n\nKilling the Crimson King or catching Flagg would've been breaking the pattern, and those are two entities far above Roland himself. They, as the tower, are unbreakable.\n\nI don't know, personally I think that both endings coexist perfectly. Is it disappointing not to see a satisfying end for Flagg, after all that happened? Sure thing. I was left like \"wait, that's it?\" myself, yet after some thought I came to terms with it and realized, it is what it is, and it is fine. A great tale that I thoroughly enjoyed.",

It's not just that King should have gave Roland a better ending, but it took him so long to write the series and that's the best he could come up with. Kings endings are usually crap but how can  you give your most iconic character such an unsatisfying ending?",

And the fricking way to destroy him....some random character who they met at the end who can draw. How about make the Crimson King some horrific, evil monster, alien, something. But Santa? And then, what was the whole point of this giant adventure of nobodies who build themselves up, learn to work together, learn from prior mistakes, character arc. The story is supposed to build the characters to become the warriors that could defeat such a villain. \n\nAnd then, the epilogue where Stephen King warned the readers not to read ahead because they would be disappointed. I halfway understand that Ka is a wheel so it's a loop. But what about this journey was different than priors, that made the next one slightly different because Roland now has the horn? It just randomly happened? Such a BS terrible ending. \n\nAfter reading it, I quit Stephen King. I had read over 20 of his books, and not another since. So horrible. Hated it. Wasted years on those books.",

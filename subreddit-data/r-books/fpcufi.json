That's my bad people.",

It has some darker themes but overall is really not that bad, Coraline is by far his scariest kids book in my opinion. In the grave yard book the main villain just wants to find and kill the main character, similar to the main plot of the early Harry Potter books.  It is also somewhat implied that even if he dies he can still just live as a ghost with his friends in the graveyard. In Coraline the other mother is literally harvesting children\u2019s souls for her own entertainment and then traps them in a closet for all eternity once she\u2019s bored of them.",

The author of the work has the right to protect or license all derivative works based on their property. (If he did it as a livestream, it would be a public performance, which is also covered by copyright.) So like u/TableTopTech said, if reads the works without permission he could be sued by the authors. But like Neil Gaiman did, the authors can give permission (a license) for other people make derivative works/do live performances, while still maintaining their rights against everyone else.",

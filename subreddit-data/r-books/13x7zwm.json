    "postText": "4/5 stars\r  \n\r  \nThis is my first Tom Clancy book. I first knew about Rainbow Six by the PC game that was launched together with the book back in the 90's. The \"Rainbow Six\" brand became one of the most famous Tom Clancy games of all time, together with Splinter Cell. There are big differences between the book and the game, especially in terms of firefights even though the first game is an strategy game first and a first person shooter second.\r  \n\r  \nThe Rainbow group is quite interesting. The characters are typical military stereotypes, but good ones. The low point is that they are mainly American and British with token non-Anglo-Saxons just for show. The German Weber and the French Loiselle do receive good coverage but the really important stuff is done by English-speakers, either US or British heroes. The game is far more \"international\" with Italian, Spanish, Austrian, Swedish, Russian and Brazilian operatives - others would join the group in the following games. The game also has women and demolitions and recon soldiers. Clancy should talk more about the soldiers whose unit gives the title of the story. Instead many pages are wasted in dull moments. The soldiers' names and biographies aren't mentioned for the most part of the story; this was a huge plot hole as unimportant people got more lines than the Rainbow commandos. The author really got it wrong in this part. Even in the first Rainbow Six game each character had a small bio (the Brazilian has its bio all wrong, starting by his Spanish name, but that's better than nothing). Curiously the most interesting character is the ex-KGB colonel Dmitriy Arkadeyevich Popov, and his character development is the best in the story. Popov constantly contrasts his experiences in both sides of the Iron Curtain, gets a major participation in most of the plots and we even get a little glimpse into his personal life - his father was also from the intelligence service and we hear about his sister, Maria Arkadeyevna, just to show the ordinary public that Russian names have gender modifications. The Russians are always dividing opinions, and even an American flag waver as Tom Clancy showed admiration for them - as shown in this book and others like The Hunt for the Red October.\r  \n\r  \nThe rescue operations are great and the preparation plus execution are breathtaking, with a lot about CQB (Close Combat Battle) and hostage rescue know-how; this is the heritage that remained in the video game franchise, with the most recent one \"Rainbow Six: Siege\" being solely dedicated to it. The jungle battle, on the other hand was very anti-climatic and disappointing. The first mistakes are geographical, with Manaus being in northern Brazil, not the center. The author mentions only two rivers, but the region is the single largest riverine basin in the globe; some places are acessible only by boat and aircraft. The correct spelling for the river close to the Horizon facility would be \"Rio Grande\", not \"R\u00edo Grande\". Those mistakes are excusable but the battle description is not. The first mistake is that one does not wear kevlar helmets in thick jungle: it would stiffle the troops for no discernible gain in terms of protection. If you look Brazilian, French, Ecuatorian and Colombian jungle footage, you will see soft headgear (jungle hats and caps), amazingly enough the game is more accurate in this case, with the player able to equip its men with either light (cap), medium (hat) and heavy (balaklava) jungle equipment.\r  \n\r  \nThe jungle of the Amazon is way more enclosed than the jungles of Southeast Asia, with very tall trees and the like (which does get mentioned in the narrative) thus making the combat distances very short. Plus, the battle happened at night, narrowing the fighting distance even further; it is common for pointmen to carry shotguns because of the short distance. The Rainbow soldiers were not trained in jungle operations and they should be using assault rifles with 5,56mm or 7,62mm ammo, not the M10 submachine guns used in Close Quarters Battle in urban perimeter (again, the game was more faithful). The 7,62mm is better for thick jungle because it turns cover into concealment. The bad guys are using the HK G3, which is good but Brazilian Amazon is \"FAL country\", with the Belgian classic a favorite for me. The firefight was dull and one-sided, with the Rainbow unit winning not by superior skill and fieldcraft, but because they had a magic technological gizmo - Heart Beat sensor - that won the battle for them. Typical American mindset, and a wrong one. The small unit action I was expecting didn't really materialize, and the American tech won the day once again. The small unit tactics should have won the battle with a firefight and wounded commandos, not the pathetic turkey shot it was.\r  \n\r  \nAnother fine point was the choice of enemies, that today may be seen as ridiculous but after the fall of the Soviet Union the left was shacken to its core and only the ecologists remained, and they did proclaim such absurd ideas as shown in the book, with activists claiming part of Humanity should be eradicated; and by the means suggested in the book. The usage of terrorists from a defeated ideology was brilliant in the way it showed the uncertainty of the immediate post-Cold War period. The training moments are great and more than once I caught myself smiling while reading this book, with the mundane things that happen in the barracks and the jokes between the Americans and Brits. Other than that, the professionalism of the Rainbow operatives, and the planning before the action under the direction of the psychologist Dr. Bellow (inspired in \"I Dream of Jeannie\" maybe?), followed by the fast pacing close combat action after doors are blown up are the main prizes of this Tom Clancy classic.",

            "comment": "On your point about the backgrounds of the protagonists: Rainbow 6 isn\u2019t necessarily a stand alone novel like the games. It\u2019s part of the larger Ryanverse that starts in Hunt for Red October. Starting there you\u2019d get Ed &amp; MP, Ryan and the other American actors. \n \nClark\u2019s backstory (as well Sandy &amp; their daughters) is in Without Remorse, and he\u2019s sprinkled in throughout the larger universe in varying paramilitary style roles. \n \nDing\u2019s backstory is in Clear &amp; Present Danger, and he enters the universe at that point as Clark\u2019s Latino sidekick and future son in law. \n \nYou\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to know those guys (and Oso) before you get into R6, which is why you only really learn about the euro members. The book is too large already for re-introducing them. \n \nI can basically read Red October through R6 in a few months. Super fun techno-political/war thrillers.",

                    "comment": "Well, you're not wrong... but that's not what I meant: I mentioned the backstory of the Rainbow **commandos/operators**, like in the game.\n\nYou have small bios for each one of them and every player has his own favorites: [Santiago Arnavisca](https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Santiago_Arnavisca), [Kazimiera Rakuzanka](https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Kazimiera_Rakuzanka), [Genedy Filatov](https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Genedy_Filatov)... I loved [Ayana Yacoby](https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Ayana_Yacoby), the Israeli recon specialist. Genedy's life story from Afghanistan to the Constitutional Crisis was amazing, and I was flabbergasted as a kid by the presence of the Brazilian assault specialist, [Alejandro Noronha](https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Alejandro_Noronha). His first name is in Spanish but you can't have everything, and his very presence was amazing to me (an effort had been made). [Antonio Maldini](https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Antonio_Maldini) was good and, most importantly, he looked a lot like me, so he was always paired with Ayana as my scout duo.\n\nThe book, on the other hand, is mostly silent about these people who are the actual protagonists of the Rainbow force. Instead, Tom Clancy segways for paragraphs on end detailing minor characters who are simply not important. There is a kidnapped young woman who is described exactly in the same way ***THREE SEPARATE TIMES***, and her arch is simply to get kidnapped. And the text keeps reapeating her height, that her weight is a little above what it should be and goes on, and on, and on...\n\n# Why are you telling me this, Tom?\n\nIt has no relevancy to the story whatsoever. If anyone desperately needed to be curteiled by a [team of editors](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors), that one is Tom Clancy. The books is far too long, being big for the sake of being big; he wanted 1,000 pages, so he got 1,000 pages. Eight hundred pages would be enough. The ending is really rushed because the knots were not properly tied because of lack of focus dealing with trivialities; a problem the game doesn't have, and actually wraps it up much better.",

There was so many repetition and pointless sentences. One I still clearly recall was how Clancy kept repeating how the characters were surprised by how good English cooking was,",

But jokes aside, he repeates about Weber and the US sniper being equals to each other some five times. The discussion of Popov about how the Soviet MVD had to bring machine gunners in helicopters to kill woves being discussed many times. Stuff like that need trimming. Sometimes it's clearly copy-pasted and I would think to myself \"didn't I read this part already?\".",

So her height and weight are important to note to see when the virus starts affecting her. Her exposure to the virus is purely through sexual contact with another infected captured subject, so the scientists wanted to confirm that method of exposure works.\n\nAs for more background on the Rainbow characters, I think there are just too many to go into detail with. Ten(?) on each team, two teams, plus the support staff. It's something like 25-30 of them - if you read more of his books (the earlier ones) you will see Clancy sprinkles a ton of characters into the story, but obviously you can't go into detail with so many of them.",

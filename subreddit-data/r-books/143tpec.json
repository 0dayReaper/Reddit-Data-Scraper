    "postText": "5/5 stars\n\nChinese Warlord Armies 1911\u201330 is the third and best book of Philip Jowett's Chinese trilogy. It balances well the world building, narrative and visual references, with much better plates. It wraps it up very well given its short size.\r  \n\r  \n\"More officers than soldiers, more soldiers than guns, and more bandits than people\", with this Chinese saying the book starts at the onset of the decadent Ch'ing (Manchu) Imperial Dinasty being ousted from power in 1911, after decades of incompetence and humilliating defeats at the hands of the West and the Japanese. After abortive attempts of republicanism and monarchy, including a Quixotesque attempt at imperial restoration by the Pigtail Army that lasted eleven days and mostly killed civilians in the crossfire, China was fractured into warring parallel states. The boy-emperor Pu Yi was kept as an avatar for the people while the actual power was wielded by warlords of varying strenght and shifting loyalties. Those feudal lords were theoretically loyal to the headless Republic and followed the Republican rank system and flags, usually the Wuchang flag of the 1911 coup d'\u00e9tat with minor differences since they were made by local workshops.\r  \n\r  \nThe breakdown of central governament control in 1912 led to a period of chaos and competing fiefdoms ruled by local military governors, or \"tuchans\", the Warlods. These generals controlled and expanded their territories like medieval feudal lords, leading to 700 separate conflitcs from 1912 to 1933 - 500 in the \"remote and troublesome province of Szechwan alone\". Those conflicts ranged from low to high intensity, with large numbers of troops, but most of them remaining idly by, both because they were so low quality to the point of not making any difference or because they were unreliable. With the example of the Chili Army, the strongest for most of the period, having 480,000 men, with 380,000 being considered loyal and only 130,000 being counted as reliable combat troops doesn't inspire much confidence in the fighting quality of those warlord armies.\r  \n\r  \nThose men, mostly uniformed rabble, were prone to pillage and misbehavior, abusing the poor peasants on their area of operations. Looting, raping, forcing requisitions or demanding goods in exchange for the \"worthless notes issued by their commanders\", it is no surprise the civilian population qualified the warlod soldiers in no uncertain terms as \"bad iron\". Nothing good could be made from the \"material\" those soldiers were made; they were the lowest form of life. Many of those soldiers were ex-bandits recruited en masse, as warlords were always in need of expanding their ineffective armies. Soldiers from defeated armies were also incorporated with no illusions about their loyalty or actual efficency: their former commander would be paid by the rifles he brought, the men being a low quality commodity, dilluting even further the quality of even adequate troops.\r  \n\r  \nThe narrative presents the main \"Cliques\": the Anhwei, Chili, Fengtien and Kuominchun during the High Warlordism period, and the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) and Ankuochun (anti-NRA) at the final showdown. The chronology shows the creation of the Anhwei Army in 1916 with the pompous name of \"War Participation Army\", as they were trained and equipped by the Japanese to fight in the Great War. They were respected and considered to be elite by everybody but were immediatly defeated by the Chili Army in two days in 1920, with most of their coveted weaponry being captured by the Fengtien Clique when the defeated Anhwei fled north into their territory. With such a fiasco it's disheartening to picture the Anhwei trying their luck against the Germans.\r  \n\r  \nThe Chili and Fengtien would be the main players during the Warlord Period and engage each other in two destructive main wars that made for an interesting read. The well-equiped Fengtien would be defeated first by the genius of Wu Pei-fu, nicknamed the \"Jade Marshal\" or \"Scholar Warlord\" by his knowledge of tactics; he was mostly supplied by the Italians and stressed the importance of military drill having in the \u00e9lite 3rd Division the core of his Chili Army. He was not a strategist though, and would be defeated in the second round due to the betrayal of the Christian Warlord, who disregarded orders and re-routed his forces to Peking, proclaiming his own governament and creating the Kuominchun, \"People's Army\".\r  \n\r  \nThese armies were always poorly armed and lacking in ammunition, with photographs showing ammo bandoliers mostly empty. The warlords would scrounge everything they could get their hands on, from taking captured weapons, to buying from different foreign peddlers and from their own workshops. This created a plethora of exotic weapons as well as a logistical nightmare. Machine guns were a luxury and artillery almost unheard of, being mainly mortars, with howitzers being reserved for only the most powerful tuchans. The warlords tinkered with aviation and chemical warfare, but with neglectable results. \"Dare to die\" commando units were armed with automatic Mauser pistols and large Da Dao swords for infiltration or frontal charges. Some Renault FT and Schneider tanks were bought by the Fengtien and Renault-Kegresse armoured half-tracks by the Chili, but those weapons were rarely used due to the warlords being paranoic of having those precious machines being captured by the enemy - better to just expend the cheap cannon-fodder. Armored trains were a main source of military power and changed hands many times.\r  \n\r  \nOnly the Tin Hat Brigade, of the \u00e9lite 3rd Division of the Chili Army had helmets as standard equipment; the M15 Adrian, got either from the Russians or Serbians.\r  \n\r  \nThe warlords themselves were colorful characters, with exotic names such as \"Jade Marshal\", \"Tiger of the North\" and \"Dog-Meat General\". While the author uses Wade-Gilles, this is dilluted by his insistence on using the warlods' Chinese names instead of their more recognizable nicknames, leading to a confusing narrative. The author also shows an unwarrented obssession with the Christian Warlord due to his faith, even having a plate of him. Other warlods are mentioned, either by their brutality or their cleverness, but the most interesting characters were without a doubt Chang Tso-lin, \"The Tiger of the North\", and Chang T'sung-chang, \"The Dog-Meat General\", both from the Fengtien Clique (also the more interesting of the bunch).\r  \n\r  \nHaving served as a guerrilla fighter for the Japanese in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5, the Tiger of the North was supplied and advised by the Japanese, who assassinated him in 1928 due to the Tiger outliving his usefulness after being defeated by the NRA; his territory of Manchuria would be transformed in the Manchukuo puppet state in 1931. The Dog-Meat General was brutal even by warlord standards and full of shenanigans, having the \"three don't knows\": he didn't know how much money he had in his coffers, how many concubines in his harem and how many soldiers in his army. He was the most avid recruiter of White Russian mercenaries, having them as his personal body guard, technical jobs, elite shock units and even commandos operating behind the lines (as mentioned in the first book). With the mechanical expediency of a psychopath, he hired a force of Russian female nurses -atypical in the warlord period - to improve his army's survivability and morale. Those Russian nurses would also train Chinese nurses to expand the service.\r  \n\r  \nThis book has great pictures. The photographs are good and we can easily see details of weapons and uniforms. The plates are a giant leap from the last book, having better proportions and being more appealing. They remain somewhat monochromatic with the main uniform being bluish-grey, but they do a great job in showing the good to poor panoply of Chinese warlord soldiers. From well-kitted soldiers to poor sods using straw sandals and armed with obsolete rifles or even lances (by the sheer lack of firearms). Soldiers would have armbands to show their alligience or simply a piece of cloth pinned to their uniform. Some commanders would have reserve identifications of their enemy, already antecipating defeat and integration.\r  \n\r  \nThe rank system is again shoved in, half a page, black-and-white, with a text instead of being illustrated in the colour plates. The same with the service colors. The warlord peacock-like parade uniform of the period is not shown, instead having a boring plate of the Christian Warlord notable exactly for being inconspicuous.\r  \n\r  \nThere is a plate of a Russian cavalryman from the Dog-Meat General's body guard but we didn't get a female nurse. What we do get is the plate of a Japanese advisor of the Fengtien; an important part of the warlord warfare, with the Japanese and Soviet advisors being a notable presence. Another great addition is the two plates showing child soldiers, something also not uncommon in said war scenario.\r  \n\r  \nChiang Kai-shek's NRA would come out from being a poorly and irrelevant force to a well-equipped and hegemonic force by means of Soviet advising (of all people) and lead the Northern Expedition that finally defeated the warlords in their united front. The NRA brought in a rethink, and won by being institutionally stronger, with a more solid sense of unity. Their focus on providing flags and banners for even small units is more important than it seems, as it gave the soldiers and commanders even a cursory notion of unity - the only thing China didn't have. This didn't end China's troubles, however, as the Japanese would start their destructive war in China shortly after, and then came the civil war and the Korean War. How many of those victorious NRA soldiers showed cheering in page 9 of the chronology would be alive 20 years later is testament to the tragic Chinese history in the 20th century.\r  \n\r  \nAs an introduction, this book really makes a good job in easing the reader into the period (except for the warlords' names) and paves the way for more reasearch. The author expanded the subject in larger books such as \"The Armies of Warlord China 1911-1928\", with 200 pages, and \"China's Wars: Rousing the Dragon 1894-1949\" with 400 pages.",

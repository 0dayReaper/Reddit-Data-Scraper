But once I saw that cover in the bookcase I was entranced. Stayed up far too late mesmerized by his creeping horror as the snow fell and part of my innocence faded away.",

Amazing stories in this collection, even the most ridiculous premise is turned into something terrifying that makes you want to take cover beneath your sheet.\n\nThe one about the teacher and his students did absolutely terrify me, I\u2019m not ashamed to admit.",

    "postText": "Last week I posted on r/suggestmeabook looking to finish someone else's DNF (not sure if it's ok to link it, just see my post history if you want to see it) and promised to post my thoughts here when I was done, so here goes (the gist and a few other things first, then more specific opinions and minor spoilers later, below the gray line...)\n\nThe DNF I chose was _Defending Jacob_ by William Landay. It sucked. One star. Maybe two. \ud83d\ude10\n\nI do feel like I gained at least one interesting insight from the experience, however, which is this: I read it in 5 days, which is somewhat faster than my usual pace, and it made me realize something I hadn't before: The more immersed I am in a story, the longer it takes me to read it.\n\nYou see, I normally find it very easy to 'suspend my disbelief' and really get into a story, to see it play out in my imagination, acting each character's part, visualizing the environment, etc... And this slows down my 'words per minute' rate, sure -- and I've known that for a long time, and I'm fine with it -- but I now know there's much more to it than just that: I'm also a lot more hesitant to start or continue reading when I know it's going to require a certain amount of my attention and investment, and that slows me down as much if not more than just my WPM rate...\n\nFor example, when I'm reading something like _The Expanse_ (which I'm currently in the middle of), each book is (more or less) like a season of television, and each chapter is (again, more or less) like a full episode, where the chapter not only has its own story to tell but it also often has to advance the larger plot by at least an increment or two as well... And with all that going on, it's just that much harder to simply start the next chapter right after the last one, or pick the book up at the end of the day, when I'm maybe just a little to tired/drained to really get back into the whole thing just then...\n\nWith _Defending Jacob_, however, I ended-up getting booted out of the narrative and back into reality a few different times early on (and throughout, see more below), and what I found was that after that point, moving from chapter to chapter or returning to the book after a break was easier than it normally is...\n\nSo, basically it's this: I've seen people here talk about \"book hangovers\", and I've certainly had those, but I now realize that I can also get smaller \"chapter hangovers\", and while I'm not really willing to sacrifice my vivid imagination for some improvement in my WPM reading speed, I would very much like to find a way to minimize or eliminate these \"chapter hangovers\" if possible... Because reading slowly but enjoying it is one thing; but preventing myself from reading at all, at least some of the time when I _could_ be reading, is a whole other thing entirely...\n\nOk, with that said, stop now if you don't want to be further influenced by my opinions of this book, and/or encounter any spoilers...\n\n-----\n\nSo, first I'll talk about the writing itself, because I've already alluded to it above... And maybe I'm just being nit-picky, but there were several times when the whole narrative just fell apart for me, causing me to abruptly 'un-suspend my disbelief' as it were, kicking me right out of the story entirely...\n\nMy first example, one of several of the most minor and nit-picky offenses:\n\n&gt; Wendy said, \"Did any of you know Ben?\" She meant Ben Rifkin, the murder victim.\n\nOh? Oh!! Right, yes, thank you narrator! Because by Chapter 3 I had already forgotten absolutely every detail about the murder, the only event that had really taken place up to that point... \ud83d\ude44 I mean, ok, to be fair, he does follow that up immediately with the following, but still, that line... I just couldn't hardly take anything seriously after that...\n\n&gt; They had not known him. Calling him by his first name was just a way of adopting him.\n\nOk, so, next up is a slightly more defensible example IMO... This is the day of Jacob's arraignment in Chapter 9...\n\n&gt; When the clerk called Jacob's case...[he] was ushered in by two court officers from the lockup and made to stand in the middle of the courtroom, in front of the jury box....Jonathan passed through the swinging gate in the bar, laid his briefcase on the defense table, and took a position beside Jacob...to make a point..._I am not simply a hired gun doing my professional duty for a distasteful client. I believe in this kid._\n\nNow, as I said above, I tend to imagine scenes very fully and vividly in my head, so in my mind these two, the defendant and his lawyer, are standing shoulder-to-shoulder in a shared, steadfast solidarity, and there is zero indication otherwise until this, only a page or two later:\n\n&gt; The suggestion of a sneaky trick pulled Jonathan to his feet.\n\nTo his feet? When did he sit down?? When did he decide to abandon this grand united front he had so thoroughly established with his client and go take a load off?? This is only 16 paragraphs later mind you, 6 of which are single lines of dialog, with no scene breaks, and the author even states that the prosecution \"recited the facts of the case, _already familiar to everyone...with a minimum of embellishment_\" (emphasis mine)... So you're saying he didn't draw it out? Didn't grandstand? And since everyone was already familiar with the case he simply listed only bullet points without tons of supporting detail, etc? So we're talking minutes here, right, not hours?? _Because that's what you led me to believe._\n\nI mean, I know I'm being a bit harsh here, I know! But I can't help that this genuinely threw me for a loop, to the point where I had to re-read back a page or two just to make sure I hadn't zoned-out and missed a bunch of important stuff or whatever...\n\nAlright, anyway, now for my final example we'll jump way ahead to the first day of the trial in Chapter 25... This is easily the most egregious offense, again at least IMO...\n\n&gt; In Middlesex County, judges were ostensibly assigned to trials at random. No one actually believed such a lottery existed. The same few judges were assigned high-profile cases over and over...So it came as no surprise that the judge assigned to Jacob's trial was Burton French.\n\nYeah, no shit it wasn't a surprise: The arraignment judge already said that she had chosen him back in Chapter 9!!\n\n&gt; \"I'm sending this case out to Judge French for trial,\" [Judge] Rivera said with finality.\n\nSo firstly, saying that it's \"no surprise\" now when, yeah, it's literally no surprise which judge it was going to be -- regardless of the reason why it's that judge -- is just... it's... guuuuh \ud83d\ude44\n\nBut secondly, where was all this talk about randomness and rotation queues or whatever back in Chapter 9, when the assignment was being made to begin with?! I've never so quickly started flipping back to find wherever I knew something had been said before... I thought I'd had a stroke or there was a glitch in the Matrix or something...\n\nOk, so that's the end of me harping on the author. Now I want to finish by discussing the story itself a bit, though I don't have much room left (before I hit Reddit's post character limit...)\n\nI find that I only now know what the story was, after the fact. It was actually two stories: The murder thriller is one, and the other is a story about a seemingly empty man who is incapable of any kind of real human connection whatsoever, and the ways that his emptiness destroys himself and his family. I was _so_ not expecting the second one at all, and for most of the book it was so non-obvious that it made the writing seem just godawful, but let me explain...\n\nFirst, the murder thriller: It was fine, but I knew what the end would look like, in broad strokes, from early on. This isn't a brag; I don't believe I'm getting any smarty-pants points for saying this; it's just true. The clues that the grand jury trial which opens the book probably wasn't about the actual murder but something else, likely after, were just a little too obvious to anyone paying even half attention (and as you can see from all of the above, I'm paying pretty close attention). And it wasn't hard, then, to guess what form(s) the aftermath of the murder trial itself might take...\n\nSecondly, and I'll have to summarize here, because I'm quickly running out of room: For a good long while the characters all seemed pretty devoid of, you know, character, and it was making the book fall rather flat... But I now understand (at least I think I do) retrospectively that that's because the MC Andy Barber (the father) just doesn't give a crap at all about other people, and it's from his POV that you're seeing them all. And if this was intentional, then I do have to give credit where credit is due: While I absolutely think that narrative could have been made more apparent earlier on, to really surface that complete lack of empathy and give better context to his narrator's voice, it was still a good and fairly complex character study, even if I can only see it in hindsight...\n\nFWIW, I'm now three episodes into the TV miniseries, and so far they're sticking _real_ close to the source material... But there was a scene in this last episode where Andy goes to ask his detective buddy for a favor, and this is the exchange:\n\n&gt; \"I'm asking you as a friend. All I need is his file.\"\n&gt;\n&gt; \"A Friend?\"\n&gt;\n&gt; \"What?\"\n&gt;\n&gt; \"Come on man, we work together, it's not like we ever hung out. The first time I set foot in your house was with a warrant.\"\n&gt;\n&gt; \"Wow. That's... I always thought we were friends; I'm sorry you didn't feel the same way.\"\n&gt;\n&gt; \"Look, don't get me wrong, you're a good guy, but if this is what you think an actual friendship is, it's you I feel sorry for.\"\n\nI don't remember this from the book -- and can't find it now -- but it does a great job of cluing you in to Andy's total lack of empathy in a way that I can't remember ever getting from the book... And I wish I'd had it then, so I'd've known it was intentional and not just bad characterization...",

He could've come to agree with Laurie's suspicions about Jacob, stood back, and gotten back his marriage and even maybe some sympathy from the community by just saying that Jacob was born with a brain disorder that made him a sociopath and they did everything they could and there's no way they could've known. Writing him off, basically. Instead he fought for Jacob and fought for him and fought for him. \n\nYes, he was curt with Laurie and Jacob sometimes, but I feel that's kind of like when a parent sees their kid playing in the street and yells at them out of terror. He felt like he didn't have time to think about feelings becuase the only thing he cared about was keeping Jacob out of jail. And also he couldn't deal with the idea of Jacob being guilty. At all. He had to believe Jacob was innocent in order to keep that unwavering focus on his mission. So of course when Laurie brought up the question of \"what if he did it\", Andy got angry, like it meant Laurie loved their son less and was willing to write him off in a way Andy would never do.\n\nThat's love. My own parents would never.",

I do remember (for example) Andy fondly remembering Laurie when she was younger, and saying he'd always think of her that way, etc... But I also think, like, then maybe tell _her_ that when she's struggling so hard with this trial and stuff, you know?\n\nI don't know, I mean, I can see some good there, certainly, for sure, but I'm also now watching the fourth episode of the miniseries and so far we've seen Laurie at work (which I don't remember at all from the book) _and_ she's also at a diner rn by herself and she's chatting up a stranger about books and art and stuff (which def wasn't in the book) and it's like, damn, I wish she'd been this three-dimensional in the book... And, again, I feel like one possible reason she wasn't is that in the book we see her only from Andy's POV, and he just largely failed to convince me that he really cares much about her interests or her as an independent human being, etc...\n\nI don't know, this is probably just an 'agree to disagree' situation...

    "postText": "I\u2019m over half way through the second book of the Three Body Problem trilogy, The Dark Forest. There have been a couple of moments where I\u2019ve forgotten why a major plot line is happening or don\u2019t understand the significance of something. \n\nI asked Google\u2019s Bard to explain or expand on what I\u2019m forgetting or confused about and surprisingly it\u2019s done a great job at responding. I think a lot of what we\u2019re getting AI to do is pretty gimmicky (I\u2019m a developer and know it well), but this has by far been the most useful thing I\u2019ve had it do. \n\nI tried it with GPT and it just put things in a listicle and seemed to output a verbose nothingness. Bard worked much better. \n\nJust thought I\u2019d share a neat use case for it that I\u2019ll definitely be using again.",

            "comment": "The trouble is that chat \"AIs\" just generate responses that are \"statistically accurate\" in terms of the words used (and any particular format requested, eg \"write me a 4chan greentext\"), but the content itself might or might not reflect what actually happens in the series. I've seen people use them for plot summaries and end up with things that are totally inaccurate (e.g which say that the character who's actually the daughter's best friend in the book is her father's 50-year-old paramour and that the two don't interact).\n\n(It's even worse for recommendations, where for all but the broadest and most popular genres it is more likely to generate \"accurate sounding\" titles and authors that don't really exist than to give you the title of a real book.)",

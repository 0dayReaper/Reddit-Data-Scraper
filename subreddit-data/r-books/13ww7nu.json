    "postText": "Just finished reading my first Kerouac Novel. This novel is a bit rough around the edges it sometimes feels sluggish, sometimes too fast and sometimes annoying, but it just keeps on going. Which kinda reflects one of the main characters, Neal Cassady. \n\nThe novel is borderline about Kerouac's obsession with Neal Cassady. It perfectly captures the carefree American way of the late 40's and 50's. The bop parties, the alcohol, the casual-serious relationships with women, celebrities, mainly travelling and so on.\n\nThe parts where the novel shines were the parts where it's set On the road. Be it in a cadillac limo or in the back of a truck or in a jalopy ford. It just keeps flowing, filling your mind with ideas, making you envy the characters and makes you remember THIS book.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the read even though it felt excessive at times (which is expected from this version). Would definitely recommend.",

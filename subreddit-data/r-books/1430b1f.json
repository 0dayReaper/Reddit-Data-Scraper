    "postText": "I know that authors typically each have their own genres and niches. But I was wondering if there exists any series of books where the genre is not consistent between releases. If there's not, do you think it would be possible for a well known author to make it work? \n\nFor example: lets say an author starts off with a YA dystopian novel. But it's followed up with a political thriller, following the same characters, but following all the tropes and conventions of political thrillers. Then followed by a romantic comedy, continuing the story, following the same characters, but following romcom conventions. Then followed by... etc. \n\nThis sounds like a really fun idea, but I could see why it wouldn't work. (readers wanting to read only the types of stories they like) The only way I'd imagine this having any sort of success would be if it was done by an already successful author with fans willing to read whatever they released. Like a Stephen King embarking on such a project for instance. \n\nHave you ever seen anything like this? Do you think something like this would work? What are some candidates for existing books that you think could shift genres easily?",

Essentially one character throughout dimensions but it's less of a series and more of a unifying theme of all Moorcock's writing. You get literary fiction novels, fantasy novels, sci-fi novels, political stories, New Wave gender critical weird lit, the works. One of the big benefits is that Moorcock was a New Wave pioneer so you get a taste of the best parts of the old school pulp fiction but with a much more progressive mind as regards gender and racial themes.",

Like so much of book marketing is figuring out which labels/genres best fit a series and then marketing the book to audiences of that genre. Like there will always be some cross over of fans of different genres, but I can see that setting audiences up with the wrong expectation if book 1 is dystopian and book 2 is a romcom.\n\nI think if you keep all of the books under the same overall genre (like fantasy or sci-fi) but have  different arcs/spin-offs where their stories lean into different genres, I think that could work. This isn't a perfect example, but in Leigh Bardugo's Grishaverse, all of the books fall under \"YA fantasy\" but within that genre, the *Shadow and Bone* trilogy is a more traditional chosen-one narrative, the *Six of Crows* duology (at least the first one) leans more towards a heist thriller, and *The Language of Thorns* is written to be more like fairytales/folklore.",

    "postText": "So I'm reading through a lot of Conan the Barbarian stories and thinking about the movie and Barbarians and writing. I get to 'Beyond the Black River' and Conan is much more of a rogue; he sneaks, he understands how to move through the jungle, he listens to the wind, acts on instinct by feeling the forest. I think about the movie with Arnold and how Arnold was pretty much the best choice for Conan with the accent, the look, the everything. Then I'm like, 'It would be great to see Arnold sneak through the jungle like Conan is doing...wait...' and then I remember the movie Predator where Arnold is a fighter with forest instinct, with seeing things beyond sight, who sets traps and listens to the trees. Everything about the story Black River is somehow represented in Predator and how Predator came out after the Conan Movie much like early Conan was a Barbarian who killed things with swords but later Conan is calculating, educated, and instinct driven. The final battle in Black River is a 9 ft demon who glows with unnatural light and Conan uses fighting ability rather then pure strength to overcome him. It begins with Conan and a hunting party out to raid a village but the party gets slaughtered by creatures in the forest they cant see and a wizard who commands forest spirts. I really think Predator was the Sci-Fi squel to Conan guys.",

                    "comment": "I recently learned that HP Lovecraft, Clark Smith, and Howard were besties but I don't think Howard had anything to do with the Cthullu stuff. He set everything in his own Earth-World before the last Ice Age, after the Fall of Atlantis. The Hyborian Age he called it. There's a lot of Magic/Sorcery, mention of demons, and otherworldly stuff but never the Cosmic Aliens or Ancient Gods become manifest as seen in Lovecraft/Cthullu. Clark Ashton Smith also wrote super Cosmic Alien stuff, but Howard kept his magic pretty on lockdown and there were never aliens per se. I mean, we can't have Conan go off fighting The Color out of Space or The God of Nightmares. He can fight sorcerers who try beguiling people with visions or people turning into snakes. Like the quote from Predator, 'If it bleeds, we can kill it'. They for sure influenced each other and ran by each other for editing. I always loved Lovecraft and Smith so when I found out they were all friends I KNEW Howard was going to be my voice in writing. I was already trying to find my voice in Lovecraft/Smith but Howard is more straightforward and less fluffy. It's perfect.",

Lovecraft, and the two would sometimes insert references or elements of each other's settings in their works. Later editors reworked many of the original Conan stories by Howard, thus diluting this connection. Nevertheless, many of Howard's unedited Conan stories are arguably part of the\u00a0Cthulhu Mythos.[16]\u00a0Additionally, many of the Conan stories by Howard, de Camp, and Carter used geographical place names from\u00a0Clark Ashton Smith's\u00a0Hyperborean Cycle.",

Maybe cause it got edited out or down. IDK. They for sure shared works, ideas, and editiing. The three of them, Lovecraft, Howard, Smith. I'd love to be part of that group. Like the Existenialists in France Post-War. Solid fucking friends I tell you. Trying to make something where I live but there's also a lot of pot...",

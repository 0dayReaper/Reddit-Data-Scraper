No one reads. And I never have anyone to share my reading progress or any recommendations or anything... \n\n\nSo here goes... \nMy personal goal is to complete 25 books a year. It's been so for the last 3 years but I was not able to complete it. I reached - 18 books, 20 books and 23 books respectively each year. \n\nThis year I am at 15 books already... With 2 more in progress and it looks like I might complete my challenge this year!! \n\n\nHow about you guys?\n\n\nEdit- \nThanks everyone for responding! I am reading all the comments even though I am not replying to everyone. \n\nA common point I am seeing in the comments is about reading to target a number of books each year. \n\n- by saying I need to reach a goal I am not talking about crossing some checkboxes on the list and reaching that number as soon as possible. It's just that with everything else going on in life, it is sometimes difficult to find the time to do things you enjoy i.e. Read.. And 25 is my happy number let's say - if I can hit 25 a year steadily every year I am happy with that... And I don't really care about going over that number and I will instead go for more difficult reads / more insightful reads instead. And I am happy that this year.. finally I am doing it.. I think it is also a bit symbolic because life is now stable enough that I can find the time to do things I like...",

Trying to encourage it in the kids in my life by instead of asking 'how's school?' I ask 'what have you been reading recently?'\n\nI'm at 45 books for the year. My goal is 100, but not sure if I'll make it. Last year I got 140, but more than half of those were audiobooks I listened to at work. I've started a new job this year that I can t listen to audio while I work. \n\nI always have 4 books on the go at once - one print, one ebook, one audiobook, and a nonfiction in whichever format.\n\nI think the number is arbitrary, because reading pace, time to read, format, book length etc varies so widely. Last year I read 35 Agatha Raisin books, which are easy short reads. The year before it took me 3 months to read war and peace.",

So now I'm being more relaxed about it, still writing down the books i read but not thinking that I'm going to make 10 a month. I'm currently at 56 for the year (but few novellas thrown in there).",

I\u2019ve also always wanted to read Steinbeck, so that\u2019s been really nice. The hype was correct about those two!\n\nTackling big novels like *Count of Monte Cristo* and *War and Peace* is certainly intimidating. I find that it often takes me about 20-30% of the book to really get invested in the story, so I try to just power through the first 200-300 pages in longer books like that and then I usually find it easy to keep going after that. *East of Eden* almost instantly grabbed me\u2014as soon as the Trask family was introduced, I was hooked. *Middlemarch* was such a slow burn that I quit after about 500 pages. I may try again next year or something.\n\nI would like to introduce some more current novels into my reading, but I\u2019d like to get through as many classics and \u201cbucket list\u201d books as I can first. I am a kind of flighty personality, so I joke that I may wake up one day and not read another book for ten years lol.",

Classics seem intimidating but most of the people I've talked to who have tried tackling them say it's not as bad as it seems. \n\nI'm personally doing the same thing as you but I get impatient when a book is longer then 600 pages even if I'm really enjoy it (I flew through count of Monte Cristo and Les mis but still found certain parts hard to sit through because they weren't very important for the story). Because of that I have to take breaks and read modern books despite wanting to go through my classics bucket list as soon as possible too lmao\n\nThat's really interesting that it takes you so long to get attached to a story, I can see why reading has been hard for you in the past if you have to invest a lot of time just to start to enjoy reading a book!\n\nAre you in the middle of anything good now?

It was interesting, but I just had a feeling it wasn\u2019t really going to be a major part of the story, so it dragged a little for me there.\n\nI just finished East of Eden, and I\u2019m currently reading *Sandalwood Death* by Mo Yan. He\u2019s a strange writer and it\u2019s a strange book. Chinese is so difficult even in translation because they don\u2019t have verb tense and their pictographs don\u2019t translate 1 to 1 like languages with alphabets. The cadence is strange at times. In addition, a lot of Chinese history was just wiped out with the cultural revolution, so a lot of historical aspects are mysterious to the western mind.\n\nI want to read *Grapes of Wrath* next, and I have a few bookmarked to read in the future\u2014*Botchan*, *In Cold Blood*, *Gone with the Wind*, *Little Women*, *Demon Copperhead*, and I\u2019d like to reread *Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer,* and *Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\u2019s Court*.\n\nAny suggestions?",

I personally enjoyed the section in Rome (the descriptions of the colosseum at night were dazzling) but hated everything about the young lovers/family drama/set up for revenge. It just didn't always feel connect to the count or the plot. I also don't like Steinbeck. I've read east of Eden, grapes of wrath, of mice and men, and winter of our discontent. I enjoyed winter and MoM but don't like Steinbeck as a writer and thought east of Eden was the worst of the four (probably because he based some of it off his family lore and it felt melodramatic at times).\n\nStoner by John Williams, Ethan frome by Edith Wharton, my Antonia by Willa Cather are all indepth character studies that do what I feel people praise Steinbeck for (weaving poignant settings into complex psychological studies of individuals, families, and times). I also really recommend James Baldwin, if you enjoy Faulkner his book Go tell it on the mountain is like Absalom Absalom (Absalom Absalom is like a more experimental east of Eden so it might also fit your tastes in case you haven't touched Faulkner yet). \n\nThank you for mentioning Botchan and Sandalwood Death, I haven't looked much in east Asian literature since there's just so much in the western canon I haven't touched but I added those two to my list! I agree Chinese literature is a lot less approachable for nonnative speakers, both because it's harder to find good translations but also because they don't always follow the western viewpoint of what a novel should be.",

The chapters are rather short so far (most 6-10 pages) so it's easy to make progress. \n\nAs for the story, I may end up taking this back, but thus far it makes me think of a cross between \"Candide\" and *South Park*. \n\nThe first, because the protagonist(s) keep randomly finding random, absurd adventures, often out of the result of obsessive imagination and naivety, often with punishing results. \n\nThe latter, because Quixote himself reminds me a bit of Cartman when he becomes obsessed with an idea (in this case, pursuing the path of a chivalrous knight) that the world has moved on from, or in Cartman's case, that he has no business undertaking. Sancho Panza reminds me of the rest of the gang, including Butters, sometimes especially Butters, trying to be a foil to Quixote and usually failing spectacularly, but inexplicably remaining dragged along for the ride against their better judgement. Also, there's random bathroom humor (really!).",

            "comment": "OP that is awesome that you love to read and that you intentionally pursue it, even though people in your life don't share your love of reading. \n\nI have always been a reader. I started early (I was about 3) and I read a lot when I was a child. I had some health issues, and reading helped take my mind off of them. \n\nNow, I read all the time, and when I can't read (like when I'm driving or in the shower) I listen to audiobooks. I count those as \"reading\" - do you? \n\nIn 2010, after accidently checking out a book and then getting it home and realizing I'd already read it and doing that multiple times, I started using Goodreads to track the books I was reading. I really love that I can open the app on my phone and check to see if I've already read a book before I check it out from the library or buy it.\n\nThey have a reading challenge every year, so I've been able to track how many books I read each year, and I average 85 books per year. My high (in 2011 and again in 2018) was 125 books in one year, and my low (in 2015 - had a lot going on that year) was 50 books. \n\nI will say the vast majority of the books I read are cozy mysteries, and they tend to be shorter reads. But I also re-read Lord of the Rings every few years, and I usually get at least a few  700+ page books in each year. \n\nBut, I gotta be honest, aside from work, reading, and writing, I don't do very much else.",

I started reading again this year and I am so happy I did. I am up to 62 books so far. Last Thursday, I did my own 24hr readathon and read 4 books in one day. (It was my day off).\n\nReading has helped slow down my overthinking and catastrophizing. When I have free time, I spend it with my dopamine syringes in the form of 3 dogs (2 puppies) out on the land with a picnic basket and a blanket and I read while they explore. I'm back to be\u00ecng a highly functional depressed person as opposed to being frozen in place and trapped inside my sadness. \n\nI worry that once I complete my reading challenge I'll go back to old patterns so I don't want to even take a break, sometimes I just pick up a novella or novelette if I feel the cold sensation of the darkness creeping intonme again. And after reading 60+pages, I'm okay. I carry my kindle with me everywhere now (and I was sure I would never read ebooks or on tablets EVER). Books saved me.",

I went from competing with my girlfriend over how many books we read every year (she would always win) to not reading at all. I also went from developing games and keeping up with game development to completely dropping out of it.\n\nI tried and failed a few times to pick up a few books. I would maybe get through an easy read like Goldust's autobiography, but when it came to investing in my favorite genres, science fiction and fantasy, I would begin books and not finish them.\n\nRecently, I've started reading Shadowrun books. I decided to start on an anthology, Spells and Chrome, with the justification that a book of short stories would give me multiple little victories as opposed to feeling like I had to invest in an entire novel all at once. So far it seems to have worked. I read through all of Spells and Chrome, as well as the next two anthologies in the same series (World of Shadows and Drawing Destiny). I have since started on the older Shadowrun books, which are now branded as \"Shadowrun: Legends\". I literally just finished the first book, Never Deal With A Dragon, this morning. I feel like I'm already ready to move onto the next one, Choose Your Enemies Carefully.\n\nAfter finishing Spells and Chrome, I took it as a sign that I might be getting better. I'm still depressed as all-hell, but I'm also trying to acknowledge my victories. I decided that I need to get back into game development. So now I am slowly learning Godot, which is a new engine for me. It's a free and open source engine, runs on my potato excuse for a computer, and can output to Windows, Linux, Mac, mobile, and web. It also has a robust scripting feature, unlike the event system in my previous engine, Construct 2. I feel like being able to actually code my games gives me better control over them, so Godot seems to fit my needs. I haven't gotten very far though, as I've only made the obligatory Hello World app with it, but I've at least taken that first step.",

I had the odd phase of reading a lot, especially during summer, but even then I'd read maybe 6-8 books a year tops.  For some reason the stars aligned a couple of years ago and I found joy in reading again. I read 3 books in 2020, then 46 in 2021. 42 last year. This year I'm up to 16, and I'm so close to finishing a bunch that I might hit 20 by the end of next week. My goal is 52 by the end of the year \ud83d\udc40 I've also started branching out. I still read mostly sci-fi and fantasy books but I'm exploring different sub-genres, and I've been getting into classics, romance, horror and thriller novels as well. I'm having so much fun really indulging what I like and embracing the mood reader in me, and I no longer feel guilty for just owning a bunch of books I don't read. So far this year there have been several times when I've just picked something off one of my shelves and then read 500 pages over a single weekend. It feels great! I'm also kinda competitive and I love beating my previous \"records\" in terms of books read and/or page count. Reading has gone from something I mostly just do in theory to being my favourite hobby again, just like when I was a kid! :D",

I don't have time to read many books this year and yet I just can't seem to lay off buying books for the time being.... \n\n\nEach night I stare at my bookshelf for a minute or two and count the number of to be read books there \ud83d\ude2d\n\n\nAs for me, I've been a reader since I was 4. I remember that my sis got Charlie and the chocolate factory and Fantastic Mr. Fox as a present from our principal and head miss. She was a very interested reader and journalist till class 4 which was a pity because I started reading from her collection \ud83d\ude14 \n\nNow she doesn't collect any books \ud83e\udee0\n\n\nI read quite fast without forgetting the plot of a story ( this sincerely only applies to storybooks), So from the first grade I used to finish at least 7 books a week. They used to vary in size and themes. \n\n\nWhen I started to seriously read some of the more recognised works in 4th grade, I would say I read 30 books a year. \n\n\nThen came the pandemic and there was a halt in my progress. When the lockdown cleared I was already put into academic pressure. So for the last 5 years I have only read 25 books..... \n\n\n\nAside from me, none of my other friends can read.... \nI remember we had library classes for a few weeks to encourage reading. While I finished 2 simple books in two hours, they couldn't even stand reading with concentration for 12 mins \ud83e\udee1 \n\nSo yeah, there's literally no one for me to talk to about any interesting book \ud83e\udd72",

It's goofy but I'm loving it, especially considering I was not in any way shape or form a reader growing up. Turns out I just didn't know what medium would fit my brain until later in life and now I can't get enough",

I didn't really read in Jan or Feb, but then March I read like 6 books, April I read 8 each. May I read one a week. I slowed down and haven't COMPLETED anything yet because most of the books I started, I'd get a few chapters in and stop because it bored me.",

Last year I ended with 209 but before that it was only 60. I didn't track my reading before then but it definitely fell off the first few years after having a baby. Now I can listen while doing chores or while she paints or naps, etc and I get so much more reading time in. I know some people still say it's not really reading if you're listening, but I don't have the time to sit alone for hours and read as much as I'd like. Plus it really helps quiet my anxiety if I have something to focus on during down time. And I can listen at a much faster pace than I can read and still take the story in.",

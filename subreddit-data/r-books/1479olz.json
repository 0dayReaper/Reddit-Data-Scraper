    "postText": "English is my first language btw, and I can read :)\n\nIs this book considered difficult to read? I am finding it very dense and feeling lost as I go.\n\nEven on the first page:\n\n\u201cSEE THE CHILD. He is pale and thin, he wears a thin and ragged linen shirt. He stokes the scullery fire. Outside lie dark turned fields with rags of  snow and darker woods beyond that harbor yet a few last wolves. His folk are known for hewers of wood and drawers of water but in truth his father has been a schoolmaster. He lies in drink, he  quotes from poets whose names are now lost. The boy crouches by the fire and watches him. \n\nNight of your birth. Thirty-three. The Leonids they were called. God how the stars did fall. I looked for blackness, holes in the heavens. The Dipper stove.\u201d\n\nI'm getting turned around in the second paragraph. Who's perspective is that? Is it dialogue from the father..?\n\nI've heard great things about this book, but I'm wondering why it's sort of 'not clicking' in my mind as I read. Is there a better book of his to start with? Is there any info I should know going into it to help me along the way? Thank you!\n\nedit: I appreciate the insight everyone has shared, I'm going to keep trudging through it\n\nedit: I'm onto chapter 2 now and already getting used to it! Knowing the dialogue has no quotations is helpful (and googling some words I don't know). The book is already amazing and gritty!",

This particular paragraph is written in the voice of the \u201cschoolmaster\u201d who is teaching the boy about the night of his birth. It refers to the 1833 Leonids meteor shower, which was a massive and significant event that made the night sky appear as though it was staving in.",

Just keep going.\n\nAnyway you don't have to understand everything the first time through (and you won't anyway, no one does with this book). It's just like listening to music or watching a movie. You don't just stop listening to a song if you encounter lyrics you don't understand, right? Do you turn off a movie the second you didn't get something? No, you keep watching.\n\nSo keep reading.

If yes, go back and re-read it with that new perspective/context gained. 10 pages or more, whatever it takes - hopefully not the whole book! Ahah\n\n(I have had to make that plan because like you, I pause movies when i need to think, and I actually stop songs and Google the lyrics if I don't get it when I want to - it's harder for some people than others to accept to continue something when they don't completely understand what they currently have: I'm one of those too!)",

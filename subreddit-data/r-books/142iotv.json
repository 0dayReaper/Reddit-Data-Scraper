The time jumps we\u2019re getting annoying and I didn\u2019t see the necessity of all the different story lines. But then, while reading the very last chapter everything clicked for me and I felt like I \u201cgot\u201d what the author was going for and it instantly went from a \u201cmeh\u201d book to a \u201cwow, I really liked that\u201d book. While it\u2019s normal for one\u2019s opinion to fluctuate during a reading, I\u2019ve never had such an abrupt swing of the pendulum and I was curious if anyone had had the same experience?",

For about the first third of the book I thought it was not very interesting, terribly didactic. Then I realized when and where the book had been written, and it clicked for me that this was an attempt on the part of the author to prevent the next generation, the target audience for the book, from absorbing the militarist (read: fascist) philosophy that was being handed down to them as life advice by the powers-that-be.",

There are a few things King does terribly that popped up, but my positive feelings for the book outweighed them. Then I got to the sewer scene and just put the book down. \n\nReady Player One, like Dark Matter, was entertaining. But it started to become apparent that he was just using nostalgia to fuel a dumb story about a boy who likes a girl even though she's \"ugly\" and is just the coolest guy ever, without ever really caring about the nerdy stuff he was filling his books with. Like, there were 3+ pages entirely dedicated to basically just listing off various fandoms. He literally does with the villain of his story does. It's absurd.",

That\u2019s actually one of the reasons the book I mentioned started to lose me, some of the \u201ctwists\u201d were pretty transparent and I saw them coming from a mile away. I was close to just not finishing it, but I\u2019m glad I did!  I kind of want to check out The Guest List now out of morbid curiosity\u2026",

            "comment": "I loved the sarcastic, colourful commentary during Mark's entries in The Martian (Andy Weir). Those were the only parts I liked. As soon as the book switched to the other perspectives, I was less on board, partially because of the huge tonal shift, and partially because I didn't like how the author wrote one of the female characters. It felt like one of them said \"um...\" every other line, and she felt like a cookie-cutter female character, what with her aspirations and such, which didn't appeal to me. My enthusiasm kind of fell precipitously because those parts bored me to tears. I finished reading the book but I wasn't keen on revisiting.",

They\u2019re very cardboard\u2019esque.\n\nWeir has even been recorded in a Goodreads interview that his least favorite part of writing novels are the characters... This really bummed me out on ever reading him again. It\u2019s a novelist\u2019s job to care about the characters. Otherwise we might just as well read an article. \n\n(I know that Project Hail Mary is popular as hell and basically crack cocaine in book format. So take my humble opinion with a grain of salt.)",

            "comment": "Reminds me of the movie Sixth Sense. It became so slow and dull till we all got slapped on the face with a shocking twist that got me to watch the movie and over to see how I missed it all. \nI\u2019d say, it\u2019s very risky of an author to attempt this since many might dump the book before finishing it. But those who manage to finish the book, will be in awe like yourself. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

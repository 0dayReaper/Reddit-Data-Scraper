    "postText": "Just finished reading this one and holy cow. I went into it thinking it was a neat speculative fiction. \u201cWhat if thousands of women suddenly transformed into dragons?\u201d\n\nInstead, I was treated to an emotional knockout coming of age story, full of wit and relevance. Yes, there are dragons, but this book is about the people left behind and the choices we make in life. In my opinion, it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve read all year. Has anyone else read this?",

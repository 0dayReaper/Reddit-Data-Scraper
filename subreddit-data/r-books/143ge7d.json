    "postText": "I lost my father and brother back to back not that long ago, and my health isn't that great. My own mortality has been on my mind a lot.  \n\n\nFrom early childhood onwards, books have been my greatest treasures. I was given books for birthday and Christmas presents (or gift certificates to book stores), all the money I earned, most of it went to buying books. \n\nI've spent almost my entire adult life being really deeply poor, sometimes homeless. I lost chunks of my library several times, but some I managed to hold on to, and some parts I was able to rebuild later.  \n\n\nSome of the books on my shelves have followed me for 40+ years. The bulk I've had for over 20. They've been my friends, my touch of the familiar throughout my insane number of moves.  \n\n\nI would really love the collection to stay together after I die. My nephews are kinda flakes about things. I can't trust them to even come pick them up, much less care for them. I don't know if I will have any younger people in my life when I pass that would have any interest.  \n\n\nI just don't know what to do with my library when my time gets closer.",

The trade off is a whole greater than the sum of its parts (according to one) instead of letting the constituent parts join new libraries where different individual aspects of you can have impacts across a broader swath and affect more people. Personally, I find the latter more comforting.",

Your post resonates with me because I recently lost my father, and books kept me sane when he was actively dying. My collection brings me great comfort as well, and I also don't have anyone immediately who would appreciate my collection the same way I do. \n\nIt is likely not possible anyone will keep our collections totally whole, even if they keep most of it.  Reading is such a great connector. Would you be open to splitting up your collection if you knew those books would be loved and cherished by someone else? If they became a part of another book lovers collection? Maybe you can write inside each book why you loved it and what you want future readers to know about it. Books can end up in all sorts of amazing places, and it is kinda cool to think about how a piece of you will live on in the books you loved so much.",

The recipients all have this invisible thread connecting them.\n\nOP--Would putting a stamp or label in the books marking them as part of your library help? That way if the books are ever separated, they might be able to find their way back to each other.",

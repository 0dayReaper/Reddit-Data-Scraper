If the battle of Gettysburg happened in a fantasy setting, this is the story.  Think Michael Shaara but better.\n\nRed Country is the wild-west style fantasy I didn\u2019t know I wanted.\n\nI don\u2019t think world-building is Abercrombie\u2019s strength, but it\u2019s fine.

I love how his weapons and his mark just make their way into everyday life in small ways, like the Father of Swords, or the giant dragon in the mountain in Red Country.  \n\nIt's excellent world-building to me because I'm yearning to read more just to catch those glimpses.",

The comic relief is quite a bit higher in this trilogy, but he does a lot of really well done call backs and references to era 1. I think it's worth it.\n\nWheel of Time... Man, I don't know if there's anything **more** worth finishing. I would have GLADLY read another 14 books of that story. Sanderson absolutely did the last 3 books justice. \n\nAnd like the guy under me said, the audiobooks for Wheel of Time are just fantastic. Micheal Kramer and Kate Reading are the narrators, and they have become my 2 favorites by a long shot.\n\nIf you're going to try WoT again, I would definitely recommend just starting over though.",

Dude is rich, gets to work on pet Rick and Morty projects, and has millions of fans. But anytime someone asks a simple, nice question about DoS he loses his shit. Like actually gets angry. \n\nGRRM gets exasperated, and mad when people suggest he might die, but he still will at least talk about Winds. He at least hints it's going to one day exist and is being worked on. I've lost a lot of respect for GRRM, but Rothfuss seems like an ass. \n\nThere is a reason Sanderson gets a ton of love from me and is my favorite author, despite me not thinking his books are the best always. He works hard and is very open and kind to his fans. He will gladly answer the same question a dozen times. Every year he does a state of the Sanderson talking about all of his projects. He has a few series that have been on hiatus for ten years now, but still mentions his plans for them every single year. Even if that plan is \"don't have time right now, doing these other things and didn't touch this series. Current plan is to write this book after x\". I respect that level of communication with fans and how he respects his fans",

I figured the fact he posted he would be there the morning of the festival was sort of tacit permission to briefly say hi.\n\nMy wife and I approached him and kept a good few feet apart, and I said pretty much word for word \u201cI know you are busy and I don\u2019t want to take time away from you enjoying yourself here but I just wanted to say I really like your work. I\u2019ve read Name of the Wind, Wise Man\u2019s Fear, and Slow Regard, I\u2019ve read all your short stories, I liked your writing in Torment: Tides, I\u2019ve listened to all the episodes of your podcast with Max Temkin, and I\u2019ve gotten a lot of people to read your books. I was really hoping I could just buy you a drink, but I don\u2019t want to take up any more of your time than that\u201d and tried to hand him a drink voucher (while staying literally like six feet away). He flatly refused (\u201cno, I have a ton of those already\u201d and just stared at me until I felt uncomfortable and walked away.",

There was a huge drop in quality in the last book he released.

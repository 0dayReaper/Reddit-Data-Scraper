            "comment": "I particularly love this piece of the article:\n\n\u201cEach of the last four years have brought significant pushback for the elimination of these programs, and each year, the budgets have been restored and even increased. For fiscal year 2020, despite an initial cut in funding, the final budget included an increase of $10 million in funds made available to IMLS. This included an increase in money made available via the Library Services and Technology Act, which allocated those funds as grants to states, Native American Library Services, National Leadership for Libraries, and more.\u201d\n\nWith this track record, let his administration keep trying to eliminate library funding so we can keep watching the funding increase. That practice seems like a great slap in the face to anyone that wants libraries defunded.",

I started actively using mine a few years ago. \n\nEveryone thinks it\u2019s just books, which are still awesome, but the one here has a huge selection of movies and tv shows on dvd and Blu-ray and they even rent Blu-ray players. They have a whole section for comics and graphic novels. They have a FREE streaming service with access to all their videos and then some. They do programs for kids. They have 3D printers and other computer gear to use. It\u2019s an awesome place and there\u2019s always lots of people when I go. \n\nThe thing is, for someone like the president, he thinks everyone thinks/feels the way he does, and the one\u2019s who don\u2019t aren\u2019t different, they\u2019re wrong. So for someone who hasn\u2019t read anything more complex than Family Circus in his entire life, libraries are obviously pointless. Why do we need books if we have computers? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s never even crossed his mind that they provide invaluable resources for people that wouldn\u2019t otherwise have access to good books, computers, documentaries, and community programs, or if it has, he simply doesn\u2019t care.",

I would walk there once a week with a backpack, full it up with books, walk back home, and do nothing but read.  I got to know the librarians very well.  \n\nI started to help them out with computer issues from time to time.  I helped them a little bit more.  I volunteered more time.  I realized, slowly, that I had at least some worth.  That my time was valuable, and could help others, and that I didn't have to be just another cog in the machine.  That small library, and those wonderful librarians, helped save my life.\n\nThank you, librarians.  You might not have signed up for it, but there's at least one life you've saved.  Twenty years later you better believe our whole family carry our local library cards.",

                            "comment": "Disney lobbied for the copyright extensions during the 90s, they wanted desperately to save Mickey Mouse from entering public domain.\n\nMickey Mouse first appeared in 1928 in Steamboat Willie, under the laws at the time the copyright should've lasted 56 years, ending in 1984. But in 1976 Disney lobbied the government for an extended copyright and it was approved, coporate copyrights (like Disney's on Mickey) could now last up to 75 years.\n\nBut that would mean Mickey should've expired in 2003. Why he didn't? Well they lobbied again in 1998 and got it further extended, now corporate copyrights can last up to 95 years, meaning the Mouse is now safe til 2023. \n\nTwo things to note; their lobbying wasn't just restricted to corporate copyrights, now individual creators have an extremely lengthy copyright term too. An Author (and their estate after they die) will have the rights to any works for their entire lifetime plus 70 years past their death. \n\nSecondly, Disney have already stated that an effort to increase the copyright laws in the present won't work, they've stated the internet is a big turning point in this debate.\n\nAfter 1998, not a single work entered the public domain for 20yrs, last year on Jan 1st, 2019, every eligible copyright from 1923 entered the public domain. This year on Jan 1st, every copyright from 1924 expired and entered the public domain. As I mentioned above, Steamboat Willie will enter the public domain in 2023 and the first iteration of Mickey Mouse will be in the public domain.",

His whole public persona was shaped by TV and he cleverly used the medium, with shows like *The Apprentice*, to propel his political career. He also knew exactly what TV media craves \u2014 spectacle, drama, and outrage \u2014 and capitalized on it throughout his presidential campaign.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cDonald Trump is not a person,\u201d Poniewozik writes, \u201che\u2019s a character that wrote itself, a brand mascot that jumped off the cereal box and entered the world.\u201d And, of course, he\u2019s now entered the White House.\n\nSo, not only does Trump NOT read, his worldview is comprised of American TV.

When I went to college student tuition made up less than 15% of a universities budget. Today student tuition is over half a universities yearly budget. \n\n\nFor k-12 that's funded though local property taxes. Taxes that are deliberately and perniciously segmented off into the immediate areas around the school. Which is a unique to the U.S system way to fund schools that just so happens to circumvent the brown vs Board ruling on equality for schools.",

Any one of them is far better than Trump. Also remember that a person can only be President of the USA for a maximum two [terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_of_office) (8 years). That is why Obama could not run again.\n\nHere is something even more depressing than Trump getting voted in again ... the [Former President's Retirement Benefit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_Presidents_Act). Yep. Even if Trump gets voted out of office he is still entitled to a retirement fund paid by ..... your taxes. Double the pity he was not impeached.",

    "postText": "I'm halfway through the book, I'm going to finish it, but I was expecting something else, more intense. It seems to me that the book does not sufficiently explore some of the directions it tries, like a long-awaited but missed orgasm.\nI was expecting more spirituality, pathos, the book is full of unsalted and boring dialogues. I was expecting a more careful analysis of the characters, of how the events marked them. All the characters are mediocre from all points of view, they all seem to float on the same line of evolution. The incursions of the spiritual, the dreams of the main character are interesting, but they are not sufficiently explored either.\nI generally like to read books written by authors of various nationalities because they represent a reflection of those times, an interweaving of historical events with the social psychology and cultural elements specific to each people, but here the opportunity to reflect a nation in their customs, food is missed.\n\nI would love to see other opinions.",

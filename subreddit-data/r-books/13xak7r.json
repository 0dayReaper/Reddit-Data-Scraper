Seriously, it is the most depressing book I have ever read and I saw it on a \u201chorror/thriller recommendations\u201d tik tok. Nothing about it has been any of that, it has just been depressing in the loneliest way. Have any of you read it? If so, what did y\u2019all think of it? I am 40 pages away from the ending and I think I have figured out nothing great is going to happen.",

It's top-notch speculative fiction and I haven't read one better. Not all stories have happy endings or indeed explain the why or the what or the when. What the author is trying to say, I'll be honest, no clue. Love this book, 10 out of, speculative fiction books that are great, 10.",

(just read Station Eleven and kept wondering: what do they eat? where does the food come from? and lots of other similar things) \n\nI do enjoy a good mystery but honestly I'm not a fan of a story that leaves you with zero answers, even one of the many mysteries solved would have given me a sense of closure and made me enjoy more the whole experience.\n\nIt was still and endearing read, give me a lot of anxiety and was extremely thought provoking",

    "postText": "I'm currently reading the Stormlight Archive, which is quite a large epic series. Sometimes I'll take few month breaks while reading a book, and come back forgetting who a character was or some small plot detail. In the past, I've risked looking up a character to remember who they were but then you're often greeted with a wiki saying, \"John *was* a ...\" with the use of past tense making me go, \"Oh great, so they die.\" \n\nI really wish there was a wiki where you could put down your progress in a series and it then filters the information to avoid spoilers beyond that, but I don't think that exists. Have any of you experienced this issue and if so, how do you go about recalling details while avoiding spoilers?",

Maybe that could be a job for AI.\n\nThat being said, if ever that exists, I would 100% appreciate it. I have some personal issues with recall from time to time due to a childhood car accident, so I would need this regardless of taking breaks. For those saying \"just dont take breaks\", I think Mother\\_Tangerine's wiki idea would help outside of that particular use-case. I still see it as valid. \n\nLet me know if anyone messages you any sites or apps that would work. I would be appreciative.",

And to be clear, I'm not just putting down a book saying \"ok break time!\" and coming back months later, life sometimes gets in the way, I can get very busy, stuff happens. That's what I meant by break.",

Probably a low chance but still possible. I have resorted to asking my friend who had finished the currently available books to just look it up for me and let me know.\n\nAs for the wiki idea I had, I genuinely think that could be a great website idea that doesn't necessarily require algorithms or AI to complete. It would essentially be a normal wiki, with the only additional requirement for community entries being citing what part of which book certain information becomes known. Like adding sources to wikipedia. It could be just what general part of the book (first quarter, second quarter, etc), not necessarily the specific sentence on the specific page. Idk, just an idea I've had for a while now for a tool that I'd absolutely love.",

Without spoiling any further information revealed after this chapter. \n\nCould you summarize Y's role up to this point?\"\n\n\nEdit, I think it does remarkably well:\n\nPrompt: \" After a long break, I started book 5 of the HP novels. \n\nI remember I was around chapter 20, so I decided to restart here. \n\nHowever, there are some missing details from Sirius Black that I don't seem to recall. \n\nCould you help me summarize Sirius role up to this point? \n\nPerhaps book by book or even chapter by chapter, without spoiling anything that comes after chapter 20\" \n\n\nAnswer: \" Certainly! I'll provide you with a brief summary of Sirius Black's role in the Harry Potter series up to book 5, without revealing any spoilers beyond chapter 20. Here's a summary of his journey so far:\n\nBook 1: \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" (or \"Sorcerer's Stone\" in the US):\n- Sirius Black is not directly involved in this book. However, he is mentioned as a prisoner who had escaped from the wizarding prison, Azkaban.\n\nBook 2: \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\":\n- Sirius Black does not make an appearance in this book.\n\nBook 3: \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\":\n- Sirius Black is introduced as a dangerous criminal and the titular prisoner who has escaped from Azkaban.\n- He was falsely accused of betraying Harry's parents to Lord Voldemort and is believed to be responsible for their deaths.\n- Sirius, in his animagus form of a black dog, helps Harry and his friends throughout the book, ultimately revealing the truth about his innocence and the real betrayer.\n\nBook 4: \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\":\n- Sirius plays a limited role in this book, offering support and advice to Harry during the Triwizard Tournament.\n- He attends the Quidditch World Cup with the Weasley family and Harry.\n- Sirius also helps Harry in dealing with the aftermath of the tournament and his growing fame.\n\nBook 5: \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" (up to chapter 20):\n- At the beginning of this book, Sirius is living in a house at 12 Grimmauld Place, which is the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret organization fighting against Voldemort.\n- He acts as a mentor and guardian figure to Harry, providing him with emotional support and advice.\n- Sirius, along with the other members of the Order, works to protect Harry and gather intelligence on Voldemort's activities.\n- He also helps Harry with his struggle against the Ministry of Magic, who refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned.\n- At this point in the story, Sirius has a strained relationship with his family, the Black family, who are notorious supporters of Voldemort.\n\nRemember, this summary only covers up to chapter 20 of \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.\" I hope it helps you remember Sirius Black's role in the series so far! Let me know if you have any further questions.\"\n\nNote: Sirius dies in chapter 30 something in book 5",

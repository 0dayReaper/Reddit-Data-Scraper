    "postText": "I just finished reading it &amp; I'm kinda sad that there isn't more. But that just goes to show how great of a book it is. For those who don't know, 'Jane Eyre' is about a girl named Jane, she becomes an orphan when she is still a baby &amp; her uncle &amp; his family take care of her. Well, her uncle dies and she is left to be raised by her aunt that never cared for her &amp; her three nasty children. In the book the reader witnesses Jane transform; she becomes someone who sticks up for herself, and doesn't hide their opinions, which was weird for a woman back then. I just love her, she's tiny but mighty, &amp; an icon in my eyes. Plus I adore Mr. Rochester, every line he speaks makes me smile or laugh, he's quite a character. Anyway, I felt I had to write about it because it still lingers within me, if you haven't read it I highly recommend it! \u2661",

He preys on her low self-esteem to talk her into it, and you can just feel the awful temptation of just giving into it.",

I usually expect little from the classics (because I can perceive it differently than the author's contemporaries). However, this book exceeded my expectations. The main character reminded me of me sometimes, which helped me to understand and feel her better. Plot twists are both predictable and shocking, which, as for me, is also a plus. The love line is beautiful. The only thing I didn't like was the religious side of the story. A lot is connected with religion, faith, God, and for me it really was a problem (I have a thing about this, all my relatives are believers and they think that I am too). But I don't think it affected the overall impression of the book so much. This is definitely one of my favorite classic books. I used a lot of bookmarks while reading it :&gt;",

She fears death, she senses she will die. She is also angry, she feels it is unfair she is always downtrodden, and treated poorly. She has no Father or a relationship to a paternal \"Father\" figure.\n\nI will not bother with the Pilgrim's Progress stuff, as it seems you haven't read that..\n\nHelen on her death bed is at peace and ready to meet God on her death bed. Jane says \"are you sure there is a heaven where you go when we die\", and then reflects that her questions were never answered. SHE NEVER HAS FAITH. NOBODY EVER ANSWERS HER.\n\nShe masters herself, to protect herself she is able to master her emotions and her intellect, cultivating knowledge.\n\nShe is distrustful of Mr. Rochester, rightfully so, as he is a deceitful, prideful, seducer. He tempts her to experience passion.\n\nIt is hard for her to give herself to Mr. Rochester, to have FAITH in PASSION in this life. She runs from him when she learns the truth.\n\nShe runs to St. John the PILGRIM, who literally is sacrificing ALL ENJOYMENT in this life, in favor of faith and hope for what is to come. She is considering joining him on this mission, and then it happens... the spiritual moment, her man calls out to her... she hears him.. the first time she hears a voice, Mr. Rochester that is her spiritual moment.\n\nShe runs to him, he is now cripple, she can trust she is HIS MASTER now, and she can embrace passion in this life.\n\nSelf love, embrace of passion, taking the apple from the tree of knowledge.\n\nThough at the book she reflects, in blissful enjoyment...for now.\n\nI will add that this book is \"duplictious\" meaning that there is an exoteric meaning that most people see, and a esoteric meaning, though with proper analysis and critical consideration for the plot as well as the multiple references throughout the entire book, this is all spelled out very clearly.",

He sees not as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more wisely. I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower\u2014breathed guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me. I, in my stiff-necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to the decree, I defied it. Divine justice pursued its course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow of death. His chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has humbled me for ever. You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its weakness? Of late, Jane\u2014only\u2014only of late\u2014I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God in my doom. I began to experience remorse, repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker. I began sometimes to pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere. \n\n&gt; \u201cI thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered mercy.

It ends with\n\n&gt; As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India. He entered on the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still. A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers. Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it. He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon. His is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says\u2014\u201cWhosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.\u201d His is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth\u2014who stand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.\n\n&gt;St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself has hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun hastens to its setting. The last letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown. I know that a stranger\u2019s hand will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord. And why weep for this?

I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower\u2014breathed guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me. I, in my stiff-necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to the decree, I defied it. Divine justice pursued its course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow of death. His chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has humbled me for ever. You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its weakness? Of late, Jane\u2014only\u2014only of late\u2014**I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God in my doom**. I began to experience remorse, repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker. I began sometimes to pray: **very brief prayers they were**, but very sincere.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered mercy. I humbly entreat ***my Redeemer*** to give me strength to lead henceforth a ***purer life*** than I have done hitherto!\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Note, he speaks of brief remorse, but then give himself over to his Redeemer, who has given him purer life - this is theological, he is giving himself over to the God of this Earth, it's somewhat Gnostic, this is a different God than the Christian God  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And the book doesn't end with Jane and Edward. It doesn't end with Jane, even. It ends with  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India. He entered on the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still. A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers. Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it. He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, **who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Just to note this is another Pilgrim's Progress reference, there are many MANY references to this work, you cannot consider this book's meaning without proper context  \n&gt;  \n&gt; His is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says\u2014\u201cWhosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.\u201d His is the ambition of the **high master-spirit,** (see Gnosticism)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;which aims to **fill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth**\u2014  FILL A PLACE IN THE FIRST RANK this is GNOSTIC  \n&gt;  \n&gt;who stand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself has hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun hastens to its setting. The last letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown. I know that a stranger\u2019s hand will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord. And why weep for this? No fear of death will darken St. John\u2019s last hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith steadfast. His own words are a pledge of this\u2014  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cMy Master,\u201d he says, \u201chas forewarned me. Daily He announces more distinctly,\u2014\u2018Surely I come quickly!\u2019 and hourly I more eagerly respond,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is cryptic, but St. John represents the Pilgrim who has given up everything for the promise of the next life, he is walking the \"narrow path\" and he will not fear death, which is basically Jane's struggle through the entire book, a struggle to deal with fear of mortality  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now the last line:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2014\u2018Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!\u2019\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Amen.. I believe.. even so come... Lord Jesus  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She speaks of Jesus coming, not her coming to him, but him coming to her, this to me speaks of Revelation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I point to all of this to point out how cleverly crafted this books is worded, as to on the surface appear as though she is Christian, which was very much neccesary at the time, but if you look at the larger narrative and place this in the context of the larger story, her path toward Gnostic theology or self worship, or the idea of usurping god, luciferian doctrine it all makes MUCH MORE SENSE",

It's the most popular episode. While that's not saying much, I've yet had anyone debunk my claims.\n\nWhile I can appreciate the paragraphs you included, you fail to place them in the proper context of the entire book. You must understand that this book was already controversial in England at the time. Again, a culture deeply steeped in the tradition of Bunyan's \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" and The King James Bible. The symbolism and esoteric meaning is imbedded in a larger thematic analysis of plot, which uses the art of DUPLICITY to cleverly imbed this meaning.\n\nI encourage you to listen with an open mind, and then consider my points, if you have further questions or issues with what I have laid out, I'm more than happy to respectfully continue this exchange.",

I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not violence that best overcomes hate\u2014nor vengeance that most certainly heals injury.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\n\n\u201cRead the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts; make His word your rule, and His conduct your example.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does He say?\u201d\n\n\u201cLove your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son John, which is impossible.\u201d \n\n____________________\n\n\nWell did I remember Mrs. Reed\u2019s face, and I eagerly sought the familiar image. It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion. I had left this woman in bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries\u2014to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity. \n\n\u201cLove me, then, or hate me, as you will,\u201d I said at last, \u201cyou have my full and free forgiveness: ask now for God\u2019s, and be at peace.\u201d \n\n____________________\n\nNot a moment could be lost: the very sheets were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide and the other deep, and both were filled with water. I heaved them up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God\u2019s aid, succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it. \n\nYet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have pleased than teased him. My future husband was becoming to me my whole world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven. He stood between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun. I could not, in those days, see God for His creature: of whom I had made an idol.\n\n\n\nMy eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow. Self-abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength. I lay faint, longing to be dead. One idea only still throbbed life-like within me\u2014a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them\u2014\u201cBe not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.\u201d \n\n\n\nStill indomitable was the reply\u2014\u201cI care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself. I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man. \n\n\u201cDo as I do: trust in God and yourself. Believe in heaven. Hope to meet again there.\u201d \n\nI had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back\u2014walked back as determinedly as I had retreated. I knelt down by him; I turned his face from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my hand.\n\n\u201cGod bless you, my dear master!\u201d I said. \u201cGod keep you from harm and wrong\u2014direct you, solace you\u2014reward you well for your past kindness to me.\u201d \n\n In the midst of my pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself. I had no solace from self-approbation: none even from self-respect. I had injured\u2014wounded\u2014left my master. I was hateful in my own eyes. Still I could not turn, nor retrace one step. God must have led me on.\n\nWorn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees. Night was come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the companionship of fear. We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence. I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr. Rochester. Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-way. Remembering what it was\u2014what countless systems there swept space like a soft trace of light\u2014I felt the might and strength of God. Sure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured. I turned my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of spirits. Mr. Rochester was safe: he was God\u2019s, and by God would he be guarded. I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in sleep forgot sorrow. \n\n\u201cI can but die,\u201d I said, \u201cand I believe in God. Let me try to wait His will in silence.\u201d \n\nEre long, with the servant\u2019s aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me. I thanked God\u2014experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful joy\u2014and slept. \n\n I was sure St. John Rivers\u2014pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he was\u2014had not yet found that peace of God which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost elysium\u2014regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly. \n\nYes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment. God directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance! \n\n I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends; the bounty of my lot. I do not repine.\u201d \n\n\u201cGod will protect you; for you have undertaken His work,\u201d I answered. \n\n\u201cOh! I will give my heart to God,\u201d I said. \u201cYou do not want it.\u201d",

    "postText": "I recently saw a [film adapted cover of Fahrenheit 451](https://imgur.com/a/cHKcZ2o), and it really hurts to see a classic novel ruined by a terrible cover with actor's faces plastered all over it. Is this trend just a marketing ploy to get people to watch the film, or do you think these flashy covers encourage people to read more books? I'd like to get your opinions and discuss the pros and cons of film adapted book covers. I don't really agree with them, but I'm likely also overlooking some potential benefits. ",

Films just have much more social penetration than books. A mediocre film made of a great book will still result in many more books sold. Money and margins in publishing are so tight, companies would not go through the expense of printing a new run without very good financial reason. ",

I can hand them the same book just different cover later in the year and they are excited to read it. I spent a lot of money this year just converting books from old covers to new editions.\n\nThe movie editions also encourage them to read it because they know they can watch the movie to compare/contrast.

Different styles and design, but it was his method of teaching us not to (literally) judge a book by it's cover. Later in the year he showed us all pictures of book covers with the title/author covered up and asked which ones we'd read and which we wouldn't. Once you'd made your two lists he then revealed that they were all the books that we'd all read over the year.",

In fact I was watching stuff I ended up loving as a movie/tv show that I didn't like as a book which meant I got to see a version of the story that I actually liked. I adore the Handmaid's Tale as a tv show but I didn't really like the book at all. If I'd read the book before watching the show, I'd say I'd have been uninterested in pursuing it since I'd know what happened and that I hadn't liked it originally. ",

                            "comment": "Book covers are a big deal when it comes to publising a book, and the author often have very little say about it. For many people, they **do** judge a book by it's cover (and secondly by the text on the back, which the author also doesn't have any say in).\n\nThe cover conveys very important information to the reader, it's like a shortcut to your brain to tell you what the book is about. Have you noticed how fantasy these days tend to have drawn/illustrated covers? You probably know the type. Perhaps it's an empty throne, a long dress, the sillhuette of someone with swords draw, sometimes more abstract. While, say, realistic novels, aimed for a younger audience, often have photographic pictures as covers. Usually of some body-part, feet, hands, or upper body-but with concealed face-. You would never see a photo of someone's hair blowing in the breeze with on a sunny day if you were buying sci-fi.\n\nPutting the movie-poster on the book cover is, as has been pointed out, likely to draw in a subsection of those who watch more movies than they read. They've seen the movies, liked it, see the cover and figure, \"Hey, I liked that movie. I should read the book\". Often times the movie comes out quite a while after the book has been published, and so you can assume that the most active and avid readers have already bought and read the book with the original cover.\n\nThe people who this bugs, is not the audience these poster-covers are aimed at, but rather those who are more enthusiastic book-readers, because it breaks agains the \"rules\" of covers. Most movie-based covers look similar, and so, unless you know what the book is about based on titel alone, the cover usually only tells you one thing about genre... that it's been made into a movie.\n\nAnd another reason why I think it bugs people  (as the other comment mentioned) is because often times people have a different image in mind for the characters, and to have someone completely different-looking plastered on the cover breaks the immersion, and it can make your mental image of those characters change, which could be really distracting from the story itself.\n\nAlso, often times the movie-poster-covers are not very aesthetically* pleasing, I personally think. Granted there are some terrible none-movie-covers out there too. Though in my experience \"normal\" covers range from beautiful to ugly while the movie-poster usually limits the cover from meh to okay.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, just thought I would give my five cents on the topic.\n\n**TL;DR:** People judge books by their covers.\n\n^^Edit: ^^Choice ^^of ^^words ^^for ^^clarity",

I recently went to get it for a friend and while it has the character who plays Dirk on it, it also has the character who plays Todd in the show. Except Todd (and almost all the characters from the show) don't exist in the book. In situations like this, it's just misleading. You can read that entire book and still not know who the guy on the cover is supposed to represent. ",

There's probably loads of people who've only read certain books because of the movie - I know I have.\n\nHowever, I probably care unreasonably much about book covers... And I really don't want any of my books to have these movie tie in covers. Just for aestethic reasons, to be honest.   \nAnd for some books, I just cannot find a pretty version because of the movie cover! It is *impossible* to find a good edition of High-Rise that doesn't have Tom Hiddleston's face on the cover. Now, granted, I did only read the book because of the movie. And I did only see the movie because of him... But man, it just bugs me to have these movie poster covers in my book case.\n\nSo yeah, I'm happy if this gets more people to read the books. But the book-by-its-cover-judger in me can't help being annoyed by this. ",

If it's only available at the publisher it takes 1 to 2 weeks for us to get it (I work in a bookshop), but some editions are still present at wholesalers for us to get easily. If you're at a chain shop hey may be able to check the stock at every other branch and have it shipped over to your local one. \nSo always be sure to ask. \nThis is all for the uk though. ",

I love browsing there, I often find new, interesting looking stuff that I'd not heard of before, and if I'm looking to patch a hole in e.g. my Pratchett collection I can guarantee they will have it. But they put the most evil fucking stickers on them, that really thick type with the security devices in them, and those fuckers peel off like one millimetre at a time. The last time I bought a book there it took me 15 minutes to get the sticker off and there was still a bit of residue. That was close to two years ago. I have never bought another book there.",

The same things *could* be in the 'parlor families' today. The same infinite detail and awareness could be projected through the radios and televisors, but are not. No, no, it's not books at all you're looking for! Take it where you can find it, in old phonograph records, old motion pictures, and in old friends; look for it in nature and look for it in yourself.  Books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid to forget. \n\nBradbury's been known to waffle on the issue himself, but at least here he's not against TV *per se*, just against commercial media that pander to the lowest common denominator.  I like to think he'd be okay with outlets like HBO and Netflix that don't have advertisers to please and can offer more niche or provocative content. ",

If people read the book after seeing the movie they might as well see the movie version of the characters, because I guess their imagination will try to match them anyway.

When a book is adapted to film, it very often brings the book back onto the bestseller list, even if the book is fairly old. In almost all cases sales of the book in question increase, and these movie covers are a cheap way for publishers to get a new edition out that sells the book to the movie audience. \n\nAlso, these covers don't \"ruin\" the book. The book itself is the same (and you can easily find a copy of the book without that cover). It just brings in a bigger audience. \n\n",

You know that movie you watched and enjoyed?! Well it was originally a book! Come read me!\". So it seems like they wanna get people to read books and also grab the money of people who enjoyed the movies",

I believe there are limitations, like new releases and really obscure books. But chances are if it was in the jail library, a public library could find it. I know it won't be the same as in jail, but please don't lose your passion for reading and learning :)",

Leave the phone at home, hit the library and find a book you like and sit and read it all day.\n\nI love libraries! They have a ton of ebooks online too if you pick up a $60 kindle.\n\nLibraries are truly an underutilized resource.",

Ask at the information desk, and someone will help you get connected to that too.\n\nLoad up this generously free kindle fire with free books and read to your heart's content!\n\nAlso...\n\n&gt;It\u2019s gonna be hard to keep reading now that I\u2019m out,...\n\n....\n\n&gt;It\u2019s hard though with so much work during the day and the stress of having to build my life up again.\n\nYou can let reading be your relief from that stress and work.  Do yourself a favor: When you might otherwise reach for your phone, pick up a book or your new free kindle.  Another option: decide to get into bed every night 30 or 45 minutes before you need to go to sleep and use that time to read.  Carry your current book with you when you finally get a job, and read on your lunch break while you eat...and during your commute if you end up riding a bus or train to work.\n\nYou can enrich the rest of your life, just like you have recently.  I hope you keep at it!  Best wishes!\n\n\n",

I found that if I listened to an audiobook of a novel I had previously read I was able to not worry about when I spaced out, as I knew the story, and didn't feel the need to rewind and listen again (and again (and again)). I found that over time I got better at listening to audiobooks, and now I can easily listen to books I've never read. It's a different way of learning to pay attention, so it takes a little practice. I read all the time, but now when I'm driving or walking or exercising or gardening, I can keep listening to books. I have more than doubled the number of books I get through in a year. Good luck to you!",

I was already a huge reader, but that was a glorious 30 days...\n\nWhen I got there, they told me I could take one book, then come back when I was done. That ended after 5 trips the first day...by day 2 I was allowed to take as many as would get me through the day without bugging the guards. \n\nI figure I read close to 100 books in that period, and discovered a few awesome things I now have in my collection. The Foundation series by Isaac Asimov was the big one...\n\nJail definitely sucked, but by one made it tolerable. I was glad to be gone, and have never gotten another ticket since. ",

So, those were thrown out. \n\nI had the book thrown at me for the two I admitted were mine, though...6 months each, to be served consecutively. At the time, jails were massively overcrowded, so without that, I\u2019d have gone to county, been processed and released same day. The judge was \u201cnice enough\u201d to add a condition that he\u2019d bring me back in 30 days to sign me out...assuming I\u2019d learned my lesson, of course. \n\nThe local cop that busted me was horrified, and actually tried to intervene, but failed. We did become friends after the fact, as I got a job in the local mall where he was assigned to the substation.\n\nAbout a year later, I learned about the seven warrants. My buddy \u201cBob\u201d came in laughing. \n\n\u201cI arrested you last night.\u201d\n\nTurns out, a guy I went to school with for years, who looked something like me, had gotten one of those check-cashing ID cards under my name, and was using it any time he got stopped. He\u2019d pulled it out after Bob had stopped him for something, and BOOM!\n\nKarma. He ended up doing 18 months for false papers or something like that...\n\nAll in all, I think I won. ",

There is a very short list of acceptable books, which include the bible and coloring books.\n\n&gt;Under the Directive, prisoners will no longer be able to receive fresh food and a variety of books. As of January 2018, just 77 books are on the approved vendor list. What can the prisoners enjoy during reading time? Five romance novels, 14 religious books, 24 drawing/coloring books, 22 puzzle books, a dictionary, a thesaurus and 11 how-to books.\n\nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ny-book-ban-to-make-prisoners-safer-draws-backlash_us_5a5a4b00e4b01ccdd48b5cd0\n\nIt's incredibly fucked up and it's also fucked up how little coverage it got. If you're in prison or jail, you're a non-person. People don't care, and it seems like there's nothing the ones who _do_ care can do.\n\nReading doesn't just keep your mind occupied inside, it's a positive activity. It doesn't just change your outlook, it changes how your brain processes information. People hoard good books and trade them. These are people who, on the outside, almost never read. There is no reason to take that away except for sheer brutality.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Someone below says this has been rescinded by order of the governor, which is awesome.\n",

I can't imagine doing the time I did without books.\n\nFrom how I'm reading it in that article, this ban is for the vendors specifically. They are restricting who you can order new books from as a prisoner. It's not like they are not going through their already plentiful libraries and burning old books that already are in the system and weren't sold through one of those vendors (which would obviously be insane).\n\nI don't agree with this in the slightest but it's clearly one of their chosen action plan items to stop the increase of contraband. If you ask me, they should be looking moreso at the dirty COs or civilians who work there, rather than limit the book vendors. What a joke. But then again it's always easier to blame the outside vendor (at the expense of the innate) instead of expose the corrupt system they have running on the inside.",

Pages are torn out when someone needs paper for whatever reason. People who aren't used to taking care of books are rough on them, breaking spines, bending them. They are stashed under mattresses. They get wet (in prison your bedroom is your bathroom). Without being replenished the book supply will degrade to nothing in a couple of years.\n\n&gt;I don't agree with this in the slightest but it's clearly one of their chosen action plan items to stop the increase of contraband.\n\nIn what way are they contraband? Books are checked before they come in. I can't think of people ever using books to stash anything. You stash things in your waistband, in your shoe, in your mouth. Are you saying that people are using books to trade other contraband, like drugs, or that they're the contraband themselves? Either way I think you're wrong.\n\nAlso this will still allow the approved books, like bibles. So whatever you think books are being used for will quickly be replaced by stacks of bibles that are there for no reason _but_ that.",

You can serve multiple years in jail if your trial takes that long happen. You have the right to have it in 6 months (fair and speedy trial) but both sides can submit motions to move the trial date.\n\nTypically you can only be sentenced to 364 days in a jail, once you have to serve a year you're moved to a prison.",

Remembered my reader but forgot my glasses. Just changed the font size and was able to read with no problem",

The magical realist style and thematic substance of One Hundred Years of Solitude established it as an important representative novel of the literary Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s, which was stylistically influenced by Modernism (European and North American) and the Cuban Vanguardia (Avant-Garde) literary movement. Since it was first published in May 1967 in Buenos Aires by Editorial Sudamericana, One Hundred Years of Solitude has been translated into 37 languages and sold more than 30 million copies. The novel, considered Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's magnum opus, remains widely acclaimed and is recognized as one of the most significant works in the Spanish literary canon.",

Publishers often require that each digital copy is only loaned to one person at a time (just like physical library books). This ensures that authors, narrators, and other creators are paid fairly for their work, even if it's consumed digitally.",

Of course, we always encourage our patrons to use those electric services, and always take the time to help teach people how, but many of our most regular patrons depend on physical books and puzzles.

I work for a public library service and honestly its better than our digital resources in many ways.\n\nThis must be tough for parents with little kids that are enthusiastic readers. I have a dozen or so families that visit my branch every week and their children borrow up to eight books every time. Parents simply cant afford to pay for that amount of books for their kids. I hope your son finds something to keep him entertained and his brain functioning.",

When things calm down, if you want these buisnesses to stay open you're going to have to visit the stores if you like brick and mortar. Any book store that can survive this sort of blow to buisness is still going to have issues on the other side. If they survive. Obviously this is really detrimental to buisness as a non-essential buisness that is closed/will closed/should be closed.\n\nWhen it's safe, don't forget to go support your local stores for anything from food to books to hardware.",

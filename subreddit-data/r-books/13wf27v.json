    "postText": "I'm a huge fan of horror, lovecraft, and all things weird and creepy. Knowing this, my girlfriend gave me her copy of mexican gothic as a gift. I had never heard of this book before this but i read through the whole thing in a week, I couldn't put it down. I absolutely loved it\n\nBut apparently people don't like this book very much? I looked it up online after finishing it and the general consensus seems to be \"it's over-rated\"\n\nFrom what I've read I think people had too high expectations based on how much the book had been talked up beforehand. For someone like me, who had literally never heard of it before my girlfriend gave it to me, I loved it. What do you guys think?",

The internet can\u2019t just like something- when it latches on it latches ON.  So even if something is good it gets blown so out of proportion that it can never live up.",

But this might very well have happened due to how hyped it was *before* I read it.  When people hype something a lot people create really high expectations and then things feel flat to you.\n\nThis happened to me with Corpse Bride (the film lol). A lot of people would tell me \"omg, you haven't watched it? You must! You'll love it!\" And when I did I was like \"meh, it was alright\". Years later I watched it again and loved it. I've personally learned to try to steer away from books/films/wtv when the hype is huge until I \"forget\" about them, just to make sure it's not influencing me - but it's difficult sometimes. \n\nI dare say the book is not overrated as much as it is over-hyped.",

There\u2019s a joy to getting into something way after the hype, it\u2019s all wrapped up by then and there\u2019s already a million video essays and discussion threads just waiting on you to get there.  Just did the same with Twin Peaks if we want to go way back.",

            "comment": "I also thought **Mexican Gothic** was overrated. Take my opinion with a grain of salt- I don't usually read horror- but the 1950's Mexican setting intrigued me. None of that flavor really came through in the book though. That being said, I liked Noem\u00ed as a character, and I liked it enough to seek out other (non-horror) books by the author. Since then I've read **Velvet Was The Night** and **Signal To Noise**, both of which earned a rare 5/5 stars from me. So I think some of the criticism comes from people who just aren't into horror. Plus it was praised to the skies, which is an impossible reputation to live up to.",

It's not a horror -in your face- creepy, Stephen King-type book and anyone who expects that will be disappointed.  The tension and unease build very gradually to the climactic ending which I found very unsatisfying.  I still think about this book and how weird it was.",

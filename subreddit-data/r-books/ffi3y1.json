It lead me to the listing for the original Radio 4 radio broadcast and I thought I'd give it a go.  Knowing nothing about it, I set up my reel-to-reel tape recorder, set the mic down by the radio and recorded history. \n\nSoon I had all 6 episodes which I listened to over and over again and drove my folks mad with constant references to it. But then I began to wonder about the 'telephone number of the Islington flat' that was also the odds of being rescued from certain death after being thrown out of an airlock in deep space. \n\nI tried the number. Somebody answered.\n\nIt turns out the number was real, live and someone else was now living in Douglas Adams' old flat in Islington. They gave me his then current number. I wrote it down, thanked them and then tried the number they gave me.\n\nHe answered. I was speaking to Douglas Adams. I can't remember much about our brief chat. He was very nice, very patient. He answered all my questions and then told me that an LP was about to be released. I was over the moon, so to speak. I thanked him, said goodbye and cycled home from the public phone box (we were poor) dizzy and starstruck. \n\nI did call him one more time after that and he was still nice but afterwards I felt I was bothering him too much so I never called him again. On every re-broadcast of the radio series and in every version since then the number was changed. I never apologised for bothering him because to do so would be to bother him again. I hope wherever he is, he didn't mind.",

His wonderful way of looking at things, and beings combined with his incredible wit was a true gift.\n\nTo anyone who hasn't, read \"Last chance to see\" by Adams and Marc Carwardine. It's like a BBC documentary in your head, narrated by Douglas Adams. It's just as witty as H2G2 and when you read about his encounters with endangered animals, you see just what a terrific frood and wonderful person he was.\n\nThank you Douglas.\n\n\n... perhaps my favourite quote in all of the H2G2:\n\n*Arthur felt happy. He was terribly pleased that the day was for once working out so much according to plan. Only twenty minutes ago he had decided he would go mad, and now here he was already chasing a Chesterfield sofa across the fields of prehistoric Earth.*",

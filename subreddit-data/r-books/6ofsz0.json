But I warn you, if you don\u2019t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist - I really believe he is Antichrist - I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my \u2018faithful slave,\u2019 as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you - sit down and tell me all the news.\u2019\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well- known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n\nQu'est-ce que tu as pu dire \u00e0 propos de moi, petite chienne? Je vous ferai savoir que je suis dipl\u00f4m\u00e9 de ma classe dans Navy Seals, et j'ai particip\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreux raids secrets sur Al-Quaeda et j'ai plus de 300 tueries confirm\u00e9es. Je suis form\u00e9 \u00e0 la guerre des gorilles et je suis le plus grand tireur d'\u00e9lite dans toutes les forces arm\u00e9es am\u00e9ricaines. Vous n'\u00eates rien pour moi que pour une autre cible. Je vais vous essuyer avec une pr\u00e9cision dont on ne l'a jamais vu plus t\u00f4t sur cette Terre, marque mes putains de mots. Vous pensez que vous pouvez vous arr\u00eater de me dire cette merde par Internet? Pensez encore, fucker. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que nous parlons, je contacte mon r\u00e9seau secret d'espions \u00e0 travers les \u00c9tats-Unis et que votre adresse IP se d\u00e9roule maintenant afin de mieux vous pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 la temp\u00eate, la mouche. L'orage qui efface la petite chose path\u00e9tique que vous appellez votre vie. Vous \u00eates putain, mon enfant. Je peux \u00eatre n'importe o\u00f9, n'importe quand, et je peux te tuer de plus de sept cents mani\u00e8res, et c'est juste de mes mains nues. Non seulement je suis form\u00e9 \u00e0 des combats non arm\u00e9s, mais j'ai acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'arsenal entier du Corps des marines des \u00c9tats-Unis et je l'utiliserai dans toute sa mesure pour effacer votre mis\u00e9rable cul de la face du continent, merci. Si seulement vous pouviez savoir quelle r\u00e9compense impie, votre petit commentaire \u00abintelligent\u00bb allait vous faire tomber, peut-\u00eatre que vous auriez retenu votre putain de langue. Mais vous ne pouviez pas, vous ne l'avez pas fait, et maintenant vous payez le prix, vous \u00eates un idiot. Je vais vous fureur sur vous et vous vous noyerez. Vous \u00eates putain mort, kiddo.\n",

I cancel the precises, which we have never seen on this Earth, signal the fucking words. Do you think you can go away, if you tell me that \"through the Internet\"? Think again, cock.

The storm, that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You are dead, kid. I can be anywhere, at any time, and I can kill in 700 ways and this just my bare handheld. I'm not only studying in unarmed combat, but for the full arsenal of the Navy of the United States, and I completely use up my misery on the face of the continent, you little shit. If you [plural] would could've known, how unholy revenge your little \"smart\" comment soon wants to bring down itself, maybe you would've kept your whore tongue.

Olen saanut koulutusta gorillasodank\u00e4ynnist\u00e4 ja olen koko Yhdysvaltojen asevoimien paras tarkka-ampuja. Et ole minulle mit\u00e4\u00e4n muuta, kuin yksi kohde muiden joukossa.

Eventually she just stopped talking to me. She is slowly starting to talk a little again because I am no longer reading the comics but its still very little. I enjoy it though.",

His dad says Georgio would rather play video games, but he makes his son grab a book all the same. His pick? Home Run Kings.\n   \n&gt; He *may not love* the reading part, but the part where he gets $2 from the barber to put in his piggy bank? That part is pretty great.\n  \nThat is how you develop a good habit with small rewards. I know for some this may seem forced but good habits are hard to enforce sometimes and this is one of the best ways. ",

The local library and goodwill sponsor this so I always have a mountain of books to give out.

            "comment": "Not sure I like this. The kids don't care about the 2 dollar discount, so it ends up being an incentive for parents to *make* their kids read. I feel like many kids will be forced to read by their parents, and they get nothing in return, making them dislike reading. I feel like a lollipop or toy worth 2 dollars would be way better if you want kids to actually read and keep liking it. \n\nEDIT:  as /u/TheQueg and /u/punfull point out, the end of the article strongly implies that the barber gives the 2 dollars directly to the kid, instead of giving a 2 dollar discount. While there'll still be parents who take back the 2 dollars from their kids, I guess they'd be a minority. If it's actually like that, I definitely *do* like it, because the kid gets an actual tangible reward themselves, and gets a positive reward for reading, while the parents aren't that strongly incentivized to force their kids to read. After all, it's the kids' choice of whether they want the two bucks or not.  ",

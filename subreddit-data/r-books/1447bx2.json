    "postText": "I think mine has to be the \"if you die, I die\" mindsets of couples. I used to think this was romantic when I was younger but now it just feels kind of selfish. Most especially when the living one chooses to die knowing that there are still people alive who care about them. Also, it seems to send a message that your whole life's worth is dependent on one person. I get that the couple are supposed to be soulmates that saved each other and all that but I much rather prefer a bittersweet ending now. One where the person grieves for their loss but later on realizes that they have to keep on living. That their partner would have wanted them to continue on living and be happy and that they have other people who love them. I think that sends a better message when it comes to grief and hope for a better life. \n\n\nWhat are tropes that you used to love before but now hate/dislike?",

Repeat ad nauseum.\n\nI guess back in the day we didn't realize that realize that concussions, especially repeated concussions, can cause severe long-term brain damage, so we just accepted this trope - but reading older mystery novels now, this really sticks out as a problem.",

Being out for more than a minute or two from a blow means there\u2019s a good chance someone won\u2019t wake up at all. But you see tons of books claiming that a knowledgeable warrior can just knock people over the head and they\u2019ll reliably be unconscious for half an hour or so. It\u2019s endemic in fantasy too, either as a cheap way to end a scene when it\u2019s the POV character knocked out, or a way to gleefully engage in violence without considering moral consequences where it\u2019s someone in the protagonist\u2019s way. Or sometimes I honestly think the authors believe this is how it works because they\u2019ve seen it in all the other books.",

I find it irritating to have details purposefully withheld to manipulate my emotions, and I often feel that the ultimate conclusion wasn\u2019t worth the effort. A lot of writers who use this structure aren\u2019t as talented and clever as they think they are. It\u2019s just such a frustrating reading experience.",

            "comment": "I think with yours, I understand what you're saying, but it may be about how it's handled. I wouldn't have understood it as much without reading a historical novel featuring an exceptional real-life couple, and then the actual historical source material, and the fact of wanting the survivor to carry on, them having a reason to (which was the case), was right but the survivor's feelings really didn't feel like a choice, they were really like one whole I think. Not many fictional couples are portrayed with that convincing a connection, but I think the intent is to show the strength of the couple's love and overwhelming nature of grief. People can carry on after a loss and say that part of them still died with the loved one, it's perhaps more often seen with parents who lose a child in real life, it's not really expected that they'll be able to be the same, it can apply to a surviving partner too.\n\nI was going to say redemption narratives, which include ideas I find fascinating (why would someone commit an act that requires it and how that affects what the process means, how people change, how we feel about rehabilitation as a society and as individuals, and just to try to understand it as a concept, especially religious redemption that can feel more 'alien' today) but I think it's that without a moral framework for them replacing religious context -I'm a far left atheist so it's not that I don't want that- the use of them has got ridiculous. Edginess and taboo for the sake of it has been the 'in' thing, to the point it can mean characters committing absurd and poorly motivated acts and the 'redemption' meaning the reader now being expected to sympathise with them because reasons. Their behaviour may still continue to be bad, too - the significance assigned to acts becomes arbitrary, may even be purely that the character feels bad about this one thing but not actually about harming others in general. It's no better when literary novels go for navel gazing faux-guilt that cheats by focusing on all the wrong things (whether the act was that serious or not. The Kite Runner uses the shocking taboo of male child rape but that aspect isn't actually the main character's fault). Redemption is supposed to be hard, a spiritual struggle within religious contexts, a movement for change. There a lots of ideas about structural, systemic change that could be explored in addition to individual (The Kite Runner touched on class but ultimately dodges it to focus on the individual, the main character and how he feels). The tendency of postmodern novels to go out of order does not help. Whether it does or not, I don't want to read pages and pages of dancing round a ~dark secret~ that inevitably turns out to involve rape (*so* much rape), incest, having let a mentally disabled sibling drown, a combination of the above, but all those pages were actually the character coming to terms with feeling mildly bad about it so it's definitely fine now. The intent may not strictly always be a redemption narrative in the traditional sense TBF, but 'therapy redemption' sucks in comparison.\n\nI was still enthralled watching the original version of the opera Boris Godunov, in a production that made clear the religious intent  (the later version very extensively adds more historical scenes), and interested seeing a production of Richard III that was done very similary (similar story!). It felt very hard to understand but that only made it more powerful.",

The shortest explanation is that tropes are story conventions or character traits that are identifiable because of audience knowledge of a genre or medium, and they're typically building blocks. Cliches are just \"overused/lack of originality\" , and tropes can also be cliched if they don't help presentation or story growth.

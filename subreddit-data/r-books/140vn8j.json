    "postText": "There are some imprints or collections that I really love and, as someone who fancies themselves a collector, I often try to stuff my shelves with as many entries from these imprints as I can. As an example, I really like the [SF Masterworks](https://www.sfgateway.com/imprint/orion/gateway/page/series/sf-masterworks/) imprint for science fiction, the [Hard Case Crime ](http://www.hardcasecrime.com)Collection for hard-boiled crime fiction , and the [Penguin Modern Classics](https://www.penguin.co.uk/series/PENMODC/penguin-modern-classics) for, well, modern classics (love, love, love their covers and fonts).   \n\nI\u2019d love to hear your favorites! Either the strength of the entries themselves, the aesthetic of the covers, the quality of the bindings (Folio Society is a good example here).",

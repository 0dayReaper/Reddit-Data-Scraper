For an audiobook performance it might make sense to use an actor to guide the inflections, kind of like in [this demonstration](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/4/17/17247334/ai-fake-news-video-barack-obama-jordan-peele-buzzfeed) (which includes video faking too).\n\nI'm interested in the potential of this technology to reduce the bandwidth required for audio and video conferences. At the beginning of a call your software could transfer data about your voice, speaking characteristics, physical appearance, and mannerisms and then the compressor on your end could send a very highly compressed data stream consisting of independent streams of text, vocal inflections, face expressions, etc, extracted from your live speech. The decompressor would use the model of your speech to reproduce your performance. The network could drop less-important bulkier parts of the stream as bandwidth conditions changed, allowing the reproduction to progressively fall from high def video, less nuanced video, nuanced audio, less nuanced audio, robotic audio, and finally text.\n\nYou'd probably want cryptographic signatures on the data and models so that viewers could have some assurance that a given individual had approved the performance.\n\nThis has some interesting implications for public figures like heads of state. The President could authorize certain people to quite literally speak for them. Institutions could potentially create immortal representations of the institution that the human leaders currently in charge of the institution would puppet.",

We could totally just get his pronuciation and such from the data we have, then superimpose that on a performance by an actor.

He turned me onto Limguistics and I even speak (to the extent it can be) and help teach Quenya in my freetime.\n\n\nBut \"created\" 13 (ish) languages is an exaggeration. He laid the outlines and simple phrases for well over a dozen. But fully fledged languages? There's like 1.5 - Sindar and Quenya. Quenya isnt even fully created, we need to reconstruct likely verb and nouns forms from other Elvish languages like Avari and Sindarin all the time. You couldnt hold a ling conversation in original Quenya. With modern additions it's much easier.\n\n\n\nBut after those two, the ability to \"speak\" the languages tapers. Andunaic has a lot of words, but most are reconstructions. Black Speech was nearly only phonology and the One Ring inscription. But people have fkeshed out more, so there's songs in all Black Speech like Mirdautas Vras by Summoning.\n\n\n\n\nThat being said, despite not being full languages, just laying out the ground work for dozens of languages with unique grammars and phonology and interlocking histories is amazing.",

I believe he saw himself as a \"subcreator\" within God's larger creation. So he definitely wouldn't have consciously related himself to Iluvatar. And in fact he also wrote as if he was simply a philogist that came across these texts (namely the Red Book of Westmarch) and decided to translate them, furthering him from a god/creator role even more. He made it clear Eru was outside the world with no analogue or incarnation within it. The closest Tolkien related himself to any of his characters was Beren as far as I know.\n\nEDIT: Some [more](http://m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcreation) on [subcreation] (http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sub-creation): The idea was that in Arda, Iluvatar was the creator of Ainur, Elves, Men, Dwarves, etc.  who were subcreators, designing and shaping things themselves within Arda.

He would have been educated into RP in school and at university, so as other posters note that's most likely what we're hearing. \n\nHe may be emphasizing some pronunciations as part of the performance: I'm sure he would have been very conscious of \"performing\" his text for the tape recorder.

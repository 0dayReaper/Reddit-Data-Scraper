I also dislike how every time I see writing or artwork now, my instinct isn't to really \"see\"  and enjoy it, but instead to inspect it and confirm whether it's AI-generated or not. It's distracting and it steals a lot of the enjoyment.",

Artists always respond to innovation. I\u2019m actually excited that this will push artist to new styles and mediums in protest.",

The vast majority of the time, it's not in novels. Truly creative fictional writing is certainly harder for AI to do, if it can do it at all yet, but it's also a pretty small fraction of what \"writers\" as a profession actually do. A lot more writers make a living writing copy than they do writing fiction, and thats also exactly the area AI is targeting.",

It's the end of the workday, and the traffic's very bad, so getting to the store takes way longer than it should, and when you finally get there the supermarket is very crowded, because of course it's the time of day when all the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some grocery shopping, and the store's hideously, fluorescently lit, and infused with soul-killing Muzak or corporate pop, and it's pretty much the last place you want to be, but you can't just get in and quickly out. You have to wander all over the huge, overlit store's crowded aisles to find the stuff you want, and you have to maneuver your junky cart through all these other tired, hurried people with carts, and of course there are also the glacially slow old people and the spacey people and the ADHD kids who all block the aisle and you have to grit your teeth and try to be polite as you ask them to let you by, and eventually, finally, you get all your supper supplies, except now it turns out there aren't enough checkout lanes open even though it's the end-of-the-day rush, so the checkout line is incredibly long, which is stupid and infuriating, but you can't take your fury out on the frantic lady working the register.\n\n\"Anyway, you finally get to the checkout line's front, and pay for your food, and wait to get your check or card authenticated by a machine, and then get told to \"Have a nice day\" in a voice that is the absolute voice of\u00a0death, and then you have to take your creepy flimsy plastic bags of groceries in your cart through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and try to load the bags in your car in such a way that everything doesn't fall out of the bags and roll around in the trunk on the way home, and then you have to drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV- intensive rush-hour traffic, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n\"The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing comes in. Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don't make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I'm going to be pissed and miserable every time I have to foodshop, because my natural default-setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about\u00a0me, about my hungriness and my fatigue and my desire to just get home, and it's going to seem, for all the world, like everybody else is\u00a0just in my way, and who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of them are and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem here in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line, and look at how deeply unfair this is: I've worked really hard all day and I'm starved and tired and I can't even get home to eat and unwind because of all these stupid goddamn\u00a0people.\n\n\"Or, of course, if I'm in a more socially conscious form of my default-setting, I can spend time in the end-of-theday traffic jam being angry and disgusted at all the huge, stupid, lane-blocking SUVs and Hummers and V-12 pickup trucks burning their wasteful, selfish, forty-gallon tanks of gas, and I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper stickers always seem to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selfish vehicles driven by the ugliest, most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers, who are usually talking on cell phones as they cut people off in order to get just twenty stupid feet ahead in a traffic jam, and I can think about how our children's children will despise us for wasting all the future's fuel and probably screwing up the climate, and how spoiled and stupid and disgusting we all are, and how it all just sucks, and so on and so forth...\n\n\"Look, if I choose to think this way, fine, lots of us do-except that thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic it doesn't\u00a0have\u00a0to be a choice. Thinking this way is my natural default-setting. It's the automatic, unconscious way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of adult life when I'm operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the center of the world and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world's priorities. The thing is that there are obviously different ways to think about these kinds of situations. In this traffic, all these vehicles stuck and idling in my way: It's not impossible that some of these people in SUVs have been in horrible auto accidents in the past and now find driving so traumatic that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive; or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he's trying to rush to the hospital, and he's in a way bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am-it is actually\u00a0I\u00a0who am in\u00a0his\u00a0way. And so on.\"\n",

We consume nachos, tacos, burritos, tortas, enchiladas, tamales and anything resembling Mexican in enormous quantities. We love Mexican beverages, happily knocking back huge amounts of tequila, mezcal and Mexican beer every year. We love Mexican people\u2014as we sure employ a lot of them. Despite our ridiculously hypocritical attitudes towards immigration, we demand that Mexicans cook a large percentage of the food we eat, grow the ingredients we need to make that food, clean our houses, mow our lawns, wash our dishes, look after our children. As any chef will tell you, our entire service economy\u2014the restaurant business as we know it\u2014in most American cities, would collapse overnight without Mexican workers. Some, of course, like to claim that Mexicans are \u201cstealing American jobs\u201d. But in two decades as a chef and employer, I never had ONE American kid walk in my door and apply for a dishwashing job, a porter\u2019s position\u2014or even a job as prep cook. Mexicans do much of the work in this country that Americans, provably, simply won\u2019t do. \n\n&gt;We love Mexican drugs. Maybe not you personally, but \u201cwe\u201d, as a nation, certainly consume titanic amounts of them\u2014and go to extraordinary lengths and expense to acquire them. We love Mexican music, Mexican beaches, Mexican architecture, interior design, Mexican films.\n\n&gt;So, why don\u2019t we love Mexico?\n\n&gt;We throw up our hands and shrug at what happens and what is happening just across the border. Maybe we are embarrassed. Mexico, after all, has always been there for us, to service our darkest needs and desires. Whether it\u2019s dress up like fools and get pass-out drunk and sun burned on Spring break in Cancun, throw pesos at strippers in Tijuana, or get toasted on Mexican drugs, we are seldom on our best behavior in Mexico. They have seen many of us at our worst. They know our darkest desires\n\n&gt;In the service of our appetites, we spend billions and billions of dollars each year on Mexican drugs\u2014while at the same time spending billions and billions more trying to prevent those drugs from reaching us. The effect on our society is everywhere to be seen. Whether it\u2019s kids nodding off and overdosing in small town Vermont, gang violence in LA, burned out neighborhoods in Detroit\u2014 it\u2019s there to see. What we don\u2019t see, however, haven\u2019t really noticed, and don\u2019t seem to much care about, is the 80,000 dead\u2014mostly innocent victims in Mexico, just in the past few years. 80,000 dead. 80,000 families who\u2019ve been touched directly by the so-called \u201cWar On Drugs\u201d.   \n\n&gt;Mexico. Our brother from another mother. A country, with whom, like it or not, we are inexorably, deeply involved, in a close but often uncomfortable embrace. Look at it. It\u2019s beautiful. It has some of the most ravishingly beautiful beaches on earth. Mountains, desert, jungle. Beautiful colonial architecture, a tragic, elegant, violent, ludicrous, heroic, lamentable, heartbreaking history. Mexican wine country rivals Tuscany for gorgeousness. Its archeological sites\u2014the remnants of great empires, unrivaled anywhere. And as much as we think we know and love it,  we have barely scratched the surface of what Mexican food really is. It is NOT melted cheese over a tortilla chip. It is not simple, or easy. It is not simply \u2018bro food\u2019 halftime. It is in fact, old\u2013 older even than the great cuisines of Europe and often deeply complex, refined, subtle, and sophisticated. A true mole sauce, for instance, can take DAYS to make, a balance of freshly (always fresh) ingredients, painstakingly prepared by hand. It could be, should be, one of the most exciting cuisines on the planet. If we paid attention. The old school cooks of Oaxaca make some of the more difficult to make and nuanced sauces in gastronomy. And some of the new generation, many of whom have trained in the kitchens of America and Europe have returned home to take Mexican food to new and thrilling new heights.\"\n\nYou can read the rest here http://anthonybourdain.tumblr.com/post/84641290831/under-the-volcano\n\n",

This was like Chris Cornell; a guy who had (one would believe) already gone through what we assumed would be the things that could break a person, and was now in a place where they could and should be enjoying life in their later years.\n\nWe thought we knew about their demons, as all of them had been vocal about them, but it seems that they had some we didn't know about and that they didn't let on about.\n\nAnd yeah, of all people to have to find him, Eric Ripert...I can't imagine how he's dealing with this.",

He said that he feels like a freak and that he feels isolated. That even though he communicates for a living he is awful at communicating with people he loves. I remember being alarmed when I first heard it but soon it I forgot. I just really wish things would have gone differently. If you hear a friend say something that alarms you, or that sounds uncharacteristically (or characteristic) dark be sure to reach out and check on them. As someone who has worked as an operator at a suicide hotline, I can say that one voice can absolutely make a difference. ",

This story is circa 2005. \n\nI was first starting out as a chef working in SF, at a shitty place called \u2018Cafe Divine\u2019 (long gone now). \n\nThey did a Sunday brunch. It was basically a non-stop slamfest of breakfast focaccia, various baked goods, and constant refills on sauces and syrups (since the servers couldn\u2019t manage not to waste half of what we had trying to refill a 12oz squeeze bottle). I fucking hated Sunday brunch. \n\nOn one of my many runs up front to refill all the things; a tall, curly haired gentleman was standing there waiting. I apologized for him having to wait, and promptly refilled all the bread. He said, \u201c No big deal, take your time.\u201d.\n\nAs I told him it was all his and was going to walk away (that\u2019s when I recognized him, and got incredibly nervous, because I\u2019m a putz in these sorts of situations), he says, \u201cI want to tell you, thank you for not putting raisins in the cinnamon focaccia.\u201d. I just thanked him,  scurried off and went down to the basement to take a few. \ud83e\udd23\n\nAnd that is my story about meeting this sweet, honest chef. It\u2019s a shame he is gone, as he was one of a kind.",

It's one of the most moving things I've read about suicide.\n\n\"The so-called \u2018psychotically depressed\u2019 person who tries to kill herself doesn\u2019t do so out of quote \u2018hopelessness\u2019 or any abstract conviction that life\u2019s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire\u2019s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It\u2019s not desiring the fall; it\u2019s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 and \u2018Hang on!\u2019, can understand the jump. Not really. You\u2019d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.\"",

So they tried to make others happy. And maybe it did help for a bit, but it isn't enough.\n\nIf you are thinking of killing yourself, remember, you make others happy. You are loved. You are enough. If you are in pain, then you have to believe that that pain will pass, even if only for a bit. And then the pain will likely come again, but it will leave again.\n\nAnd I know this seemingly endless cycle seems like a lot to ask of you, but maybe I am saying that because I want to believe for myself that it is worth it ",

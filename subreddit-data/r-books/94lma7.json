It makes perfect sense; what subject could you know better than yourself?

Someone who knows a lot about marine biology/ecology can apply that to writing about mermaids, or other undersea environments.

Someone who knows a lot about biology can apply that to creating fictional creatures. Tolkein was a linguist, and he put a lot of effort into creating languages in his books.",

He was aware of this law and was incredibly meticulous with disposing of his trash, waiting until just before the truck came to put it out.\n\nAfter a point they even got his co-workers to help by taking him to a buffet as a work-related functuon, and he avoided anything that needed utensils except some pudding at the end. The test on the spoon ended up being invalid because it had other people's DNA on it, which... Yuck.\n\nIn the end they only got his DNA because his job used disposable gloves, and the boss agreed to give it to the police once they realized they could test that.",

For a person like me who has never traveled to Asia, the book was as eye opening as Harry Potter and Sorcerer\u2019s/Philosopher\u2019s Stone.  The detective at the heart of the story, Chief Inspector Chen, is a would-be poet who was assigned his job as a police inspector.  He supplements his income by translating classical Chinese poetry into English and Ruth Rendell novels into Chinese.  The murder mystery was was the least exotic part of the story, but it too has its Chinese influence, the victim a party icon and the investigation fraught with political complications.  And, like Harry Potter, it has grown into a series.  The last time I looked, there are now six Detective Chen novels of which I\u2019ve read three so far, but the first is the best.",

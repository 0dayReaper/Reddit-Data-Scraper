    "postText": "Finished tonight a book that has certainly been intriguing as it was entertaining. And that book was the best selling science fiction novel \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" by Robert A. Heinlein.\n\nIn this novel we are introduced to Valentine Michael Smith, a human who for most of life had been raised by the inhabitants of Mars. And never once did he meet another member of his own kind.\n\nThat is until he was sent Earth, where he is an absolute stranger there, and must learn what it means to be a man.\n\nBut the the beliefs and powers that he has exceeds the limits of humanity. As he teaches grokking and grokking to the human race he is also inspiring a major transformation forever changing the inhabitants of Earth.\n\nRobert A. Heinlein was the first author to bring science fiction into the mainstream audience but it should also be brought to mind that he was also a controversial figure with a very complicated viewpoint,or viewpoints. It's strange to see a man that is both a libertarian and an ultra-conservative at the same time.\n\nWhen he wrote \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" he wrote with the idea of free love, but what that meant to him, well, is quite different from what would come later. But his ideas aside, when it came out in 1961 in an edited form (it was a bit longer initially and the version I read was the original uncut one from Ace) it was a hit. It didn't matter which side of the political spectrum you're on, everyone loved it and the book became a best seller. And further more it was a really big hit with the love generation and the counterculture hippie movement just ate it up!\n\nThe story is pretty good and even funny, while I might not \"grok the fullness of it\" entirely, it is very enjoyable science fiction.",

Heinlein was the first author to bring science fiction into the mainstream audience\"\n\nI could accept this statement if you said \"one of the first modern authors\". \n\nTHE first? Burroughs, H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, Mary Shelley, and probably about 20 more didn't exist. Or Ray goddam Bradbury. \n\nI have nothing against Heinlein. I rather liked most of Stranger in a Strange Land, Starship Troopers, and Gatway in the Sky. But he was not the first \"mainstream\" author.",

Almost everyone of his novels explores a different political and cultural concept.\n\nAs for his own politics, Heinlein had a bit of a transition in life. He started out valuing individual liberty above all else. But as he grew older and lived through several major wars, he started to see that protecting one interest group's liberties was nearly impossible to do without infringing on the wishes of another interest group.\n\nHe became of the opinion that the more densely populated a planet becomes and the more conflicting cultures are crushed together, the more important it is to find common ground. Modern warfare is simply too destructive to afford us the luxury of constant culture clashes.\n\nIt's a recurring thought in many of his novels. In Time Enough for Love, the nigh immortal protagonist often abandons world as they become too populated to go to frontier worlds. He doesn't want to live through the unavoidable world war or authoritarianism that inevitably results.\n\nIn Starship Troopers he paints a humanity that is forced to become a unified people because there are other intelligent alien species and everyone is in competition for habitable planets. A fractured humanity would have seen us outcompeted by more unified alien species.",

Take quick look at how the [French Resistance was organized](https://deepgreenresistance.net/nl/organization/structure/leader-cadre-auxiliary-mass-base/), and think about their situation. At any point, any one member of the resistance could be taken into custody by the occupying Nazis.  That captured member might be inclined to betray (here's a visa to overseas, or 500 francs) or susceptible to torture.. \n\nIn that dreadful situation, you want to limit what the person can reveal to the smallest amount possible. Each member in the secret organization should know only people essential to their mission. Ideally they won't know the true names or even physical description of those people. If they're aware of group names, the names won't have anything helpful to the Nazis.  Compare \"Jean-Franc Cassou is in the Montmarte Sabotage group\" vs \"Lapin is in group MACHINE VERTE.\"\n\nWith enough torture, the result is the same. The adversary will eventually get the true information by capturing and finding others. But it takes weeks to months instead of hours.",

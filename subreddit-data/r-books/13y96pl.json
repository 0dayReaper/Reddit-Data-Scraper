    "postText": "Personally I never understood the hype of It end's with us when it became the booktok and bookgrams favourite book to talk about. When I bought the book , the story line seemed fine. It wasn't the worst but then there are much better books out there that deserve a good hype too. Personally always found Atlas a bit characterless. I mean nice man but it's like he couldn't be that perfect, even fictional characters have flaws . I found it hard to believe that CoHo wrote him with hardly any flaws. Sometimes I think Atlas maybe a fragment of Lily's imagination.",

The characters, setting and overall plot is just genereally bad tho. Like lily blossom bloom having a flowershop that sells flowers for people who don\u2019t like flowers is just something I will never take seriously, which makes it worse since its combined with such a serious topic like domestic abuse",

But I liked the message and how it kind of deconstructed typical romance tropes by having Ryle seem like a typical romance novel hero at first, and showing &gt;!how he progressed from seemingly ideal man to domestic abuser.!&lt; I also liked Atlas and didn't find him unrealistically perfect. I feel that way about a lot of Austen-type heroes where the handsome charming guy also happens to be a duke or whatever, but showing Atlas's early history of being homeless etc brought him down to earth for me and I found his story surprisingly moving.",

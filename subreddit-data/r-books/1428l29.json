That said I think people tend to gravitate towards more genuine experiences when it comes to art/leisure. Like I stated, I've avoided buying ai art simply because... It wasn't made by a person. Artistically it's probably about the same (ai even looks better in some cases) but I value the fact that a person made it and that they had thoughts and experiences that made them want to create it in that specific way. \n\nWhen it comes to books maybe ai works will read/sound better then some authors but it's still not made by an author and imo that decreases the merit and long term value. When we remember books like the illiad we remember them not only because of the prose and message but also because they reflected the culture at the time and because of what drove the author to write it (he wasn't just writing a war epic he was criticizing the waste of human life due to his personal beliefs and values). Half the reason I read all the whale anatomy in Moby dick is because hermin Melville was talking about his experiences on whaling boats, his observations, and he was also just such a neat author (standing up for POC rights in his day and age for example). I'm not going to pick up an ai book because of the author and it's overall cultural value and message will 100% be cheapened simply because it's not an observation made by an actual person.\n\nI also considered that we might see a higher barrier to entry (newer writers not being chosen over ai works) but, again, we tend to value genuine experiences in art. That's why there's been such a massive push for bipoc and queer voices in books and media recently. I still think actual authors will be valued above ai which will make it harder for a reputable publisher to choose the cheaper option (since they won't sell as well overall).",

Most people won't do research just to determine if said author is a real person. There's no regulations to keep them from completely fabricating an author. Unless bookstores and libraries refuse to work with publishers who do this. It would take everyone refusing though, and I bet Amazon is busy working on their AI book sweatshop as we speak.",

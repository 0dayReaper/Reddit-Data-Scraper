You are not human to 9/10 correctional officers or case workers. They will degrade you any way they can to make you feel under their thumb. When you ask for help you\u2019ll get a response within a month..hopefully. There are a lot of good men that got themselves into bad positions and now they are being treat like hardened criminals. How would you respond? Angry? Frustration? Retaliation? Keep taking things away from inmates that make them feel human and they will turn into animals. \n\nIt took everything I had the years I was there to NOT turn into an animal. My loved ones definitely saw a change in my behavior. BOOKS KEPT ME SANE!!!",

He would cry himself to sleep every night because he missed the little stuffed dog he would sleep with at home.  The guards would come over the speaker in our cell and openly laugh at and mock him.\n\nI don't wish any level of incarceration on anyone.  Then again, maybe it's good for everyone to see and experience how we treat those even accused of transgression, to understand just how fucked up that system is.",

If he was on duty on a night he was having a hard time, he'd take him out into a solitary cell so he could cry it out and not bother everyone else.\n\nHe was overflow from the sex offender tank.  Had gotten involved with a 16 year old while he was 18, which is legal, except she sent him a few dirty pictures, which isn't.  \n\n30 months between his arrest and sentencing, during which he was restricted from being around any of his minor family members.  Now he's a felon, registered sex offender for at least 15 years, and his mom who's his caretaker, had to find a new place to live because their trailer park won't allow him to live with her since he's registered.\n\nWhen I was released, I sent him a big WeCare package.  Hopefully he actually got use out of it.  Some of the others in the tank would take advantage of him and con him out of the soups that his mom would get him.",

One of the worst things about prison telecommunications is the way it serves to alienate inmates from their families. In many facilities, inmates tend to get priced out of being able to communicate with their family. We have worked hard at lobbying to end some of the practices and out-dated regulations that bring this about. For example one of the practices is paying commisions to facility administrators based on usage of the platform (Companies bribe the administration to use the platform and call it commisions) The problem with this is all of that cost is passed straight on to the inmate in fees. Our largest competitors which currently dominate the industry will charge after all fees upwards of $35 for a 1-15 minute phone call. In contrast we try to charge as little as possible for the same call(we don't charge registration fees and other hidden fees for use of our platform and you can make a single phone call for a flat rate without signing up).\n\nAnother thing we are trying to do is improve an inmates ability to improve themselves by giving them ways to get education material by supplying inmates with tablets [a recent story about us](http://myfox8.com/2018/03/02/randolph-county-sheriffs-office-introduces-educational-tablets-to-county-jail/). This is our pilot program which we provided free of charge.\n\n We have the support of some amazing sheriff's that see this problem and want inmates to improve and have better lives and most importantly not come back.",

I worked out, ate right and took classes in creative writing/social behavior/etc. The jail tried to get me to take over 5 drug rehabilitation classes, my incarceration was not for drugs so I wrote a letter to superintendent and made a case that my spot should be takin by someone with a drug problem. I\u2019m from the northeast and the opioid problem here is filling jails. I lost 65 pounds and actually got my health under control. I also read more books in three years then in my entire life. The attempt the administration makes is the smallest amount of effort anyone can put into a job without being fired. The case worker you get assigned determines a lot!! They are the only one that can get you movement or classes or work details. They don\u2019t like you your time is going to be a lot harder. They just plain don\u2019t care about you. You are a number and a file. The woman I had would come in during \u201clock in\u201d time which lasts 4 hours mid day and leave before we were let out of our cells. How are you supposed to get anything done for the betterment of yourself when the one person who can help...doesn\u2019t care.  The only thing \u2018normal\u2019 is having to keep your cell clean, bed made and meals come at the same time everyday. That\u2019s it. Besides that you are left to your own devices. ",

Having a schedule, discipline, reasonable diet, social life, and accountability were an everyday thing that I guess laid a basic foundation. However, when you're released, there's nothing there. In my opinion, it should be a two step process. Do your time, serve your \"punishment\" and upon release still be held to a standard (like the probation or parole that a lot of people serve), but more focused on getting a person reintegrated into society in a healthy way. I hate being locked up or under someones foot as much as anyone, but in hindsight I know for a fact that if I was put in a halfway house type of place and been given counseling and even a low-level job, it would have been massively more successful to me personally. When I got out, I was broke, jobless, lost family support, and was really down on myself. Having more support after release would make a massive difference. Recidivism happens because it's so easy to go back to the person you were. Prison may help in the short term, but real support on the outside is what's missing in order to actually create positive change in people in my opinion",

TV, gyms, books, anything that will keep people occupied. If people are bored, it's far more dangerous for everyone in the building. These things are decided by ignorant politicians who are only concerned with looking hard on crime, as though people deciding whether to rob a corner store are carefully weighing the particulars of prison life.",

Most inmates are able to receive at the very least a GED and minor job training from most facilities (on the condition they can show that they're not gonna try to assault any staff or inmates in the process). I think you're giving educational programs a little too much credit. A lot of resources are there for inmates to better themselves but just like rehab it's up to them to take the initiative and start actively participating in the programs to become a better person when they leave. Forcing them to become educated as part of their release won't exactly accomplish much since I don't know if you're aware of this but some inmates just don't care. The majority of American prisons operate in a way that those who have shown good behavior will be rewarded with more benefits, privileges, and work opportunities while those who have murdered while locked up and participated in assaults will be placed under tighter restrictions to prevent anymore injuries or deaths. I support the ones who take advantage of the programs they're allowed to participate in but don't act like having these programs or forcing them on inmates will magically solve a lot of the problems going on with our prison system.

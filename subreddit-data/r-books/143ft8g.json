It is sweet, funny, so well written, interesting, well paced, good story and good characters, I would consider this literature.  I don't want to read anything else by her, because I don't like how she makes me feel things with my whole heart, when I thought my heart was a cold black hole.  Don't know if you've ever seen this and wondered about it, but I would totally recommend it.",

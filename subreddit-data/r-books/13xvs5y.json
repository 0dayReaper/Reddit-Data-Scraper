    "postText": "To me, the best way to learn history is from a well-crafted book-- preferably from a really talented and capable author. Have you had an experience where you read a book and just became obsessed with what you learned. I remember reading Lindbergh (Scott Berg) and wanting to talk about airplanes for weeks on end (and I don't really care that much about airplanes--lol). Two others that became obsessions were The Devil in the White City (I live in Chicago) and Unbroken (I esp. love books about the early-mid 1900s). Do you get that love-of-learning feeling from books? And do you subsequently annoy your family &amp; friends with anecdotes and details? LOL.... Which history-focused books did this for you?",

What a story. Erik Larson's other books are good too. You may like Mary Roach, who writes engaging books about the science of outer space, corpses, and sex. I just finished Never Home Alone, which is all about the microbiology and diversity of life in our houses. Occasionally i read a chapter from Cheese and Culture, about the history of cheese in Europe! You may also like: The River of Doubt - Theodore Roosevelt exploring the Amazon. Happy reading :)",

Check out, if you haven't already, his American history novels like \"Burr,\" \"1876,\" \"Lincoln,\" and \"Empire\" -- as well as his novel about the Roman emperor Julian the Apostate (\"Julian\") and his Herodotus-inspired \"Creation.\" They're really incredible books.",

In particular I found it fascinating that while Grant was almost certainly an alcoholic he had a surprisingly modern understanding of his condition and knew what stressors and situations to avoid and was able to stay on the wagon as long as he had his support network around to help him. \n\nMike Duncan's biography of the Marquis de Lafayette was also fantastic, and I loved the portrayal of him as someone who for the most part figured out what he believed in by his 20s and stood to his principles for decades as the political climate around him shifted and his relative position on the spectrum moved to the left and right while he just stayed who he was.",

Throughout my 64 years, books have taught me about two of my favorite subjects: religion, and military history, which might sound slightly weird juxtaposed topics, but whatever! Anyway, you are completely right about how a great book can transport you, enchant you, take you away from life circumstances that might be stressful or unhappy, and give you the sense that you a part of a wider, ever strong, living and growing universe: it's not just you alone: you have a community. There's no room to list all my favorite historical works, but, a sampling: Guadalcanal Diary by Richard Tregaskis (1943), Guadalcanal by Richard B. Frank (1990), The Case for God by Karen Armstrong (2009), The Seven Storey Mountain by Thomas Merton (1948), The Varieties of Religious Experience by William James (1902), The Battle of Midway by Craig Symonds (2011), The Confessions of St. Augustine (ca. 450 AD), The Histories by Herodotus (ca. 440-430 BC), The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin (1859).

I found the books by Tom Rob Smith to be PHENOMENAL. His trilogy about the Soviet-era policeman are riveting! I\u2019ve never cared for Atwood (I know, I know) but Alias Grace was her best work in my opinion. The Half-Drowned King and it\u2019s companion works are great too if you love early English/Viking stuff; I\u2019d also recommend Hild. Pope Joan, about the only female pope, is fantastic in ways I can\u2019t express. Also Gedge is a GREAT writer - her stuff is older but so we\u2019ll written! I could go on for eons; o have almost 2,000 books and the great deal of it is historical fiction. Margaret George is a good writer too - her two books on Nero are what hooked me. And finally, if you don\u2019t mind a splash of supernatural, try The Terror, about the Franklin expedition that encounters a \u201cbeing\u201d on the attic ice. That writer does so well with doing in-depth historical research against a background of myth and terror",

I had to read this for a history class in college and loved it. It offered a fascinating perspective on the famous ride before the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The romanticized depiction does not match societal norms of that time!\n-\tPanther in the Sky by James Alexander Thom. It\u2019s a novel depicting the life of Tecumseh, a member of the Shawnee tribe who led the uprising of indigenous tribes against white settlers and joined the British in the war of 1812. Most of my high school class hated the book but I loved it.\n-\tPrairie Fires Everywhere by Caroline Fraser. I only got through 2 chapters the last time I tried to read it before life took over, but I\u2019m itching to read it!! It offers more historical context to the Little House series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. As someone who loved the books growing up, I am fascinated by the historical setting and seeing a lot of those depicted events within the greater picture of the US and the expansion west.",

No conspiracy theories but it fascinating look at the events in 1963. It is amazing how the nation and world came together during this time. \n\nAmerican Caesar -  biography of Douglas McArthur.  McA was unlike any American leader and this should be a must read for anyone interested in WW2, the military or leadership. \n\nBtw - you mentioned Unbroken. That is one of the few books that I can say actually changed my life. So intense and a book everyone should read.",

            "comment": "OK, controversial one.\n\nGeorge MacDonald Fraser wrote the Flashman Papers.  He took the bully from Tom Brown's Schooldays and built a military career around him,  A drunk, a bully, a womaniser and a coward, he *looks* like a stalwart hero, and comes out the other end smelling of roses, mostly.  So, between 1839 and 1894 he is involved in some of the most crucial events of the British Empire, and he skilfully inserts the fictional character into real events.  The First Afghan War.  The First Sikh War.  The Indian Mutiny.  The Taiping Rebellion.  And... the Greasy Grass.  You know it, oh yes...\n\nHe also met, fought alongside or ran away from James Brooke of Sarawak, various British PMs, John Brown of Harper's Ferry, Gordon of Khartoum, Queen Victoria and her \"hooligan\" son, Bismarck, Kit Carson, Lincoln, too many others to name.  It was probably one of the most painless ways to learn 19th Century history.  It's great.\n\nWhy controversial?  Because Flashman is at times quite racist, as people were then.  Uses the N word a *lot*, especially when in the US South, first overseeing slaves and then helping them escape.  I can say with some certainty the *character* has a grudging respect for non-whites while not admitting, while the author is clear he's a long way from that.  Flashman is very reflective of the attitudes of the day, but the author is often at pains to portray non-whites as just as smart, just as clever, just as... human.  And often the bad guys really are on the pale spectrum.  And the way he used it *never* encouraged me to emulate him.\n\nThe series will take you down sideroads you never knew existed.  Like what John Brown was doing before Harper's Ferry, the Tranby Croft Affair, the Battle of Isandhlwana (but sadly not the Siege of Rorke's Drift), and Colonel Napier's expedition against King Tewodros II of Abyssinia, and many, many others.  He actually fought in the US Civil War (on *both* sides!) and was a gold miner in '49 and in Australia, but sadly the author didn't live long enough to write them and didn't want anyone else to either.  There is fanfic out there but I've resisted.  And it's better than I've said.\n\nTerry Pratchett once said, \"Any day George MacDonald Fraser publishes a book is a good day.\"  He could be a reactionary old bugger in his other writings, but always readable.  And if you're a Discworld fan, his 3 books featuring Private McAuslan, just after WW2, I think had an influence on some DW characters.  Crivens!\n\nDon't expect political correctness!!  GMF hated it!\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Flashman",

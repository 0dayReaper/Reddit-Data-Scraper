It is the most beautiful book I own, and my personal history with Dune makes this quite meaningful to me even if it is just rampant consumerism to cash in off the new wave of interest in hard sci-fi.\n\nAnyway. That's mine.\n\nAnd sorry again about that spine picture.

I promised myself that I won't be fooled so easily again, long ago.  Never again.      \n\nUnless you mean just picking up books off a shelf and deciding if they're worth a read, because the cover caught my eye.   Then yeah, when I still went into book stores to shop for books.   \n\nHowever, I can't recall having done that since I started reading eBooks almost exclusively. Maybe a decade now.   \n\nWith eBooks that you can't just pick up and turn over in your hands, cover art seems so less relevant.  \nHowever, I will say that I've chosen to *not read* more than a few eBook's descriptions because the title art was bad enough to be cringeworthy. To the point that no art at all and just a plain title would have served the  author better.  \nJust this morning, while browsing through the list of book titles, I noticed the cover art from a mid-series book and thinking that I'd never have gotten into, much less enjoyed the series so much, if that had been the first impression the self-published author had made on me.   (This was when looking at Will Wight's Kindle catalogue where he is/was doing a one day only give away of all his books, except the omnibus editions.)  \n\nBut now that AI art is becoming a viable thing, with art far better than most of those terrible covers that I'm glad I can't remember, I guess this will make cover art even less relevant for many of us.",

The cover of the book had an old-timey picture of a kid playing stick ball in Brooklyn. It was in the discount section of Media Play-a store that hasn't existed in my area in at least 15 years . . . maybe 20. Anyway, I started reading it that night and finished it the next day at work.",

Sometimes I'll hear good things about a title, or the summary will pique my interest, but then I'll look it up online and see cover art that screams \"beach-read romance\" or \"paranormal romance\" and immediately move on.  Sometimes the cover art tells you everything you need to know, but in the reverse way the marketers were hoping for.",

Usually what triggers me to get a book is the synopsis (if there isn't one I get mad and put the book back in the shelf).\n\nRecently I fell in love with the book Momo (by Michael Ende). I liked the cover of the edition that was available in my library ([abstract style](https://img.wook.pt/images/momo-michael-ende/MXwxNTU2MDY1M3wxMTA1NDA1MXwxMzkyODA4NzM4MDAwfHdlYnA=/550x)). But apparently the portuguese publisher released a new edition this month with [a new cover](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0450/0717/5837/files/01040820_Momo_RL_1024x1024.jpg?v=1684312683).

Some of them probably won't ever get a second read from me, but there are some great novels in there I love that I probably wouldn't have gotten around to otherwise. I mostly stopped actively buying them when B&amp;N definition of \"classic\" got a little loose, but I still find myself tempted by the especially pretty ones when I'm in the store.",

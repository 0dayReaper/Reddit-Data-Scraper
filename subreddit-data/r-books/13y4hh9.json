    "postText": "I've recently finished reading Just Kids by Patti Smith which actually took me a year. It was a slow read for me, however in the last few pages, I was touched deeply. Two children of art, both ahead of their time, struggling to make it but were saved by their mutual trust, love, and compassion to one another. I don't want to delve deep into details because I do not contain the needed energy for writing as of the moment. So let me just put it this way, I want what they had. Minus the dying part.\n\n\u201cWe learned we wanted too much. We could only give from the perspective of who we were and what we had. Apart, we were able to see with even greater clarity that we didn\u2019t want to be without each other.\u201d\n\u2015 Patti Smith, Just Kids\n\n\u201cPaths that cross will cross again.\u201d\n\u2015 Patti Smith, Just Kids",

I don't take the same view of their relationship - I think it started out that way, but Patti loved him more &amp; had a rose tinted view. Robert knew he was sick and insisted on making love, putting her at risk. \n\n\nI'm a tad jealous that it seems they found success/respect/recognition for their art by seemingly just being in the right place at the right time &amp; by chance knowing the right people. I guess the world was smaller then . . .",

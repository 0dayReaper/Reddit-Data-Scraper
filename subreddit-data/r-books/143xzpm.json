    "postText": "Hey fellow bookworms! I could really use your help in finding books that match my reading style.\n\nI have slight dyslexia and a short attention span (thanks, technology!). While I don't need books in large print or dyslexifont I find that even if I enjoy longer books I lose interest before reaching the end (or the library won't extend the checkout a 4th time).\n\nSo, I'm seeking advice on how to discover engaging paper books that are around 200-300 pages, depending on the font size.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo give you an idea, here are some books I've been able to read in the past few years: \n\n* The Road   \n*  Jurassic Park    \n* Lexicon    \n* Spark    \n* Little Brother    \n* Jennifer Government   \n* The Room\n\nUnfortunately, there have been a few books that I started but couldn't finish, like \"Mr Nice\" and \"The Hidden Palace,\" even though I really enjoy them.\n\nI've also explored different formats and found that while I'm not into short stories, I do enjoy comic books that are not superhero or manga-related. However, these formats have their own limitations. \n\nAdditionally, I'm not a fan of reading on phones or Kindles. On the other hand, I've had success with audiobooks and should probably investigate them more, but ultimately, I'm after ways to enjoy good old-fashioned paper books that I can get through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstead of focusing on specific genres or books, I'm interested in tips and recommendations on how to find shorter yet engaging paper books, without having to open every book in the library. \n\nWhether it's strategies for browsing bookstores and libraries, seeking recommendations from friends or book communities, or exploring lesser-known authors, I'm open to any insights you can provide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour advice and suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!",

                            "comment": "On the other hand, if you don\u2019t like short stories, you might not like novellas. I have ADHD, and I dislike the beginnings and endings of books the least. I strongly dislike the task of \u201cgetting situated\u201d in a book. And short stories are literally all getting situated. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, I think looking for 200-300 page books is probably your best bet. If you read SFF, perhaps seek out books with simpler premises, because it\u2019s really hard to get situated and tell a story in 300 pages.",

            "comment": "Okay, I have some weird suggestions. I know you said you don't want specific genres or books, but it might point you in a new direction. (That's how I operate. I love consuming information for inspiration)\n\nWeird Suggestion 1: The Flower Letters. This is a monthly subscription service. They send you two letters a month via mail over the course of a year. It's stories told through letters, but it's not just a letter either. They send....goodies (postcards, maps, posters, stickers, etc.), even some interactive elements. I think right now they have a promotion to send the first two letters free if you sign up for their newsletter. It might not be your favorite genre, but it could be a fun way to read something short. Right now, I am receiving The Norah Aven Chronicles. It's about a girl who gets plunged into a secret, ancient world of Icelandic myth while trying to figure out how her uncle died. The author also does her own art. Like, the demon that she sent with my last letter...it's just...wow. Anyway, it could be a really fun way to ease into reading. \n\nWeird Suggestion 2: Manga books. (Uh, didn't you see that I don't like manga? Mmhm) There is one line of books called Manga Classics. So, imagine Poe but in manga form. They're short, but might help you stay interested. The physical copy is expensive but the digital copies are less than $1 \n\nWeird Suggestion 3: The same as before, but the graphic novel Locke and Key. You might have seen the show on Netflix. Warning: The graphic novel is a little...graphic.\n\nFinal Weird Suggestion: Cliffs Notes. It would serve two purposes. One it's a condensed version of a book so you would get the most important things about it without having to read so much that you lose interest and Two: You might find one that is so interesting that it makes you want to read the full version. I have found that if I lose interest in a book, it's because I don't actually like the book as much as I think I do. \ud83d\ude09\n\nI'm sorry if this wasn't at all what you are looking for, but I couldn't help myself. Either way. Good luck.",

This is a really good out of the square idea. \n\nThe classics sound good too. I think something gets lost in the traditional manga, like watching dubbed anime, the conversations don't flow well (for me).\n\nI've just finished walking dead and tired a few other graphic novels. Coincidently nearly finished Locke and Key comics (funny as I only got through season1 of the show, will have to re watch now). I've looked into other popular novels, Y last man, invincible, beast man, paper girls. But either the art or the story dont capture me as much.\n\nEdit: That's some steep costs for the letters I'm not in USA and it doesn't include postage, might be some local ones tho.",

Each letter is about two pages, front and back. I didn't even think about the shipping costs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry I wasn't able to offer anything helpful for now, but I will keep thinking about it and shoot a message your way if I come across anything else. I am a connoisseur of nifty things so I'm always finding fun stuff. It's a gift, lol.",

You can enter books you liked and it will give you books to consider.  What's even better is that it often tells you why they recommend another book.  I'm sure other programs are out there.",

But how can you get a paperback printing if your hardcover doesn\u2019t sell? And how can your hardcover sell if a bookseller won\u2019t sell it unless you can prove it will sell in advance?  Barnes &amp; Noble is trying to capture the wonder of wandering your local indie bookstore, while simultaneously narrowing how much you could possibly discover. It wants you to think that it\u2019s as personal and local as your independent bookstore would be, while showing you the same five books you\u2019ve already seen blasted all over BookTok.\n\nThis is the problem with the whole Winner-Take-All Attention Economy, not just this one bookstore chain.  Everything is set up to amplify what was already amplified, and ignore everything else, because \"nothing succeeds like success.\"  See Hollywood for another example.",

There was a sewage backup that made the entire store stink to high heaven, they wouldn't let us close down and leave. If the power went out, they wouldn't let us leave for hours and hours, we'd just be standing around in the hot dark, waiting for the soup to expire so we could throw it out. There was an issue with the grease trap in the back, so I was often doing dishes while standing  in dirty water up to my ankles. A huge ladder fell on my head one evening. I had a customer grab me by the lanyard one time, so now anytime I work at a place that uses lanyards, I buy the breakaway kind. People sometimes grabbed my Sharpie marker right off my lanyard (resting against my chest). Customers would tell me that if I went to college, I could get a \"real job\" - I had a college degree and graduated summa cum laude, but the economy was in the toilet because... 2008. Management blamed cafe employees for sales going down and not, y'know, the huge economic meltdown that was unfolding before our eyes. Drunk people would come in and cause problems on weekend evenings, and trying to get them removed so we could close was a problem because they acted like idiots. Etc etc.\n\nI don't think it's any worse than any other food service or retail, but it was not a very pleasant place to work, either.",

I've since learned my lesson with Amazon. Nowadays, I do all of my pre-orders through B&amp;N because (1) I want them to stick around and (2) I want to boost the number of sales they get from non-mainstream books.\n\nI did visit recently specifically to look at books from a NYT bestselling author, and the way they've cut down on their stock is alarming. For this author and several other big names, they only had the most recent 1 or 2 publications. By contrast, they had entire tables dedicated to BookTok faves like Colleen Hoover &amp; Sarah J Mass. If their in-store stock continues down that path, I'm going to have to go elsewhere.",

But how can you get a paperback printing if your hardcover doesn\u2019t sell? And how can your hardcover sell if a bookseller won\u2019t sell it unless you can prove it will sell in advance?\u201d\n\nOk, I honestly did not know that all books come out in hardcover first and only go to paperback if the hardcover does well enough. That seems like a weird approach to book selling all round, I don\u2019t know a single person who prefers hardcovers. To me they\u2019re too big, unwieldy, and often they don\u2019t fit my bookshelves. \n\nWouldn\u2019t both authors and stores sell more if they started making books available in people\u2019s preferred format right away, rather than only the awkward one and then stop selling it altogether if not enough people buy it\u2026?",

Partly they have gone down because trade paperbacks are more affordable but still give a higher end look than mass market paperbacks. Authors tend to make more royalties off their hardcovers, not because they make a higher percentage of profit, but because the profit margin is higher (I think it is on trade paperback, too). Publishers and authors make the least money on mass market paperbacks. If they can get away with not selling them (unless they are an author really devoted to an audience that very much loves them); or waiting to sell them; they will, from a purely financial standpoint. \n\nI prefer mass market paperbacks. They fit in my back pocket, I can hold and flip the pages with one hand. I can pick them up at great value on the secondhand market. If I have to, I\u2019ll get hardcover. I avoid trade paperbacks like the plague. They have none of the advantages of either paperback or hardcover. They\u2019re expensive for a paperback, too big for my pocket, can\u2019t be held and turned in one hand, and aren\u2019t as sturdy as a hardcover. I see no reason for them at all.

BN allows me to visually browse through to discover books. They are more expensive, yes. I'm not supporting a local owner, yes. So after I discover a new author or series at BN, I'll usually buy online from a smaller store.",

In theory, indie bookstores are better for looking around and finding something new, but the problem is that some owners or employees seem to think of me as a burden. Sometimes I go to a bookstore and look around for hours. Very rarely, I get nothing, but normally I buy at least seven books, which is expensive. B&amp;N seem fine with me for hours just wandering around and maybe buying nothing. When I go to the indie bookstore deep in Dallas they sort of watch me as a nuisance or as if I am going to steal a book. B&amp;N being a big company and so not really needing my money makes it less stressful for me to be there, if that makes sense.",

That's like saying it's better to fall off an 80-foot cliff instead of a 100-foot cliff. Guess what, y'all? Either way, you're dead. \n\nThe appeal of indies isn't that they're small, or cozy, or cool, or whatever. It's that they're local. When you buy books from indies, the money goes to people who live in that community and sponsor the sports teams and buy ads in the local circular and do all that stuff. Plus, they shop in your community as consumers with money in their pockets. \n\nWhen you buy books from B&amp;N, the money goes to billionaires and millionaires who don't care about your community and just care about where they're going to go next in their yacht. \n\nYour life experiences are your life experiences. It's awesome that people felt at home in bookstores, regardless of who owned them. And B&amp;N in many communities is as good as it gets. But B&amp;N is a fundamentally shitty company, owned by people who think you are just another consumer to be monetized, regardless of how their stores are set up or what books they stock, etc.",

It's a big store and is still full of diverse and local authors. I don't know if that's a credit to the management or what exactly, but I have never struggled to find a range of diversity in the authors. But I also live in a blue state, which overall might have something to do with it. Diversity is more celebrated and appreciated than in some other areas of the US. Our small town has 2 book stores, one just a small upstairs of a local retailer that caters to books that go along with their non-book retail business (outdoors, adventure, camping etc) and then a very small used book store. While the retail bookstore will order things if you request them, it usually takes 6-8 weeks to get them and I'm not that patient if I just found a new book I really want in physical format. \n\nOf the stuff covered in the article, I am most dismayed at the removal of the educator credit, because it worked for homeschooling parents, too, and it will have a big impact on some of them.",

    "postText": "This is something that is bugging me for years and I still can't find a way to make it work for me. In any book, especially in Fantasy and Sci fi, there is A LOT of world building and lots of descriptions of the surroundings, if it is the vast environment or even just a local place. It doesn't matter how accurate the description is, it is hard for me to imagine exactly how it looks like and I feel that it really prevents me from really enjoying the world \\\\ location depicted and it just makes me want to skip all that description as I feel I am not gaining any pleasure from it. Also applies to a character and the dressings. Just can't picture those things",

            "comment": "I barely picture things in my head when I read. \n\nSetting, clothing, character descriptions. They are all just vague concepts that I hold in my mind. I can sort of weakly picture things, but I have to actively try. It's usually just sort of a shadowy outline of what's happening.\n\n I also have a nearly impossible time imagining the scale of spaces. Large open areas don't really form well in my mind's eye\n\nI've found it doesn't really hold me back from enjoying books, but I obviously connect more with character-driven narratives and unraveling mysteries than I do getting immersed in a world.\n\nI'm sure I'm not the only one who reads like this. Just means you'll probably end up preferring certain writing styles more than others.",

            "comment": "I think it's okay to skim, especially when there is a lot of description. As I get older I really like authors who find those one or two good lines that set the scene and cut everything else. I'd much rather read fifty tight words than five hundred loose ones.\n\nBut that said, over-description can be a great way to camouflage plot or allude to minor connections. George RR Martin gets a lot of flack for his lengthy descriptions of food, but take a look here (Dance with Dragons minor spoiler): \n\n&gt;\u201cThe Lord of White Harbor had furnished the food and drink, black stout and yellow beer and wines red and gold and purple, brought up from the warm south on fat-bottomed ships and aged in his deep cellars. The wedding guests gorged on cod cakes and winter squash, hills of neeps and great round wheels of cheese, on smoking slabs of mutton and beef ribs charred almost black, and lastly on three great wedding pies, as wide across as wagon wheels, their flaky crusts stuffed to bursting with carrots, onions, turnips, parsnips, mushrooms, and chunks of seasoned pork swimming in a savory brown gravy. Ramsay hacked off slices with his falchion and Wyman Manderly himself served, presenting the first steaming portions to Roose Bolton and his fat Frey wife, the next to Ser Hosteen and Ser Aenys, the sons of Walder Frey. \u201cThe best pie you have ever tasted, my lords,\u201d the fat lord declared. \u201cWash it down with Arbor gold and savor every bite. I know I shall.\u201d  \n\nIf you piece together the entire second half of that paragraph with some of the other events/foreshadowing Martin uses earlier in the book, you know what's in that pie. If not, it's just more description. Hiding meaning in description or using it to hint at the plot is a neat trick that a lot of other authors can't pull off.",

A lot of the times I have to re-read the environment descriptions (which sometimes is *really* lengthy) to better picture it in my head, but I still feel like I'm missing the real picture, or I forget the details really quickly.\n\nI feel like illustrations would be a huge help, not only to better picture the environment, but I could scroll back to it at any point to quickly remember the details. I hope with rise of AI, generating illustrations for books will be easy",

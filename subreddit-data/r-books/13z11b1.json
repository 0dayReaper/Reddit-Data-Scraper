    "postText": "So i\u2019m like 60% through A Court of Mist and Fury rn and i\u2019m dragging myself through it at this point. maybe this is more of a personal thing but SJM\u2019s writing style is just not really for me. I like fantasy/dystopian/sci-fi and had high hopes for it. I read the first book and actually enjoyed it a lot, only because of the end part, the rest of it was a lot of world building. HOLY F I AM SO CLOSE TO DNF-ING THIS!\n\nACOMAF is like worshipped on booktok and people say it\u2019s the best of the series. i\u2019ve expressed my frustration and people say it\u2019s the best of the series and keep reading cause it gets sooo good so i kept going. Rhys and Feyre have some very cute moments but like so much of the book is just forgettable. The plot picks up for a chapter or two and goes back to being painfully slow. I\u2019m on chapter 40 rn so if it gets great near the end and i\u2019m being too hasty i apologize\n\nTHE WRITING OMG it\u2019s like she takes up three paragraphs describing a damn room! I do love vivid descriptions in books they\u2019re necessary to really paint the scene but so much of it is just\u2026not my taste. Two sentences and I get the idea. don\u2019t say it\u2019s because i\u2019m a dumb American with no literacy my SAT and English professors say otherwise. my grammer may not be good in this because it\u2019s a reddit post not an essay\n(i\u2019m just bracing myself because the acotar fanbase is an army that will attack at any criticism).\n\nI really want to just pick up another series at some point but people say the plot of the next book is a lot so maybe i should keep going? if you haven\u2019t noticed i need plot i\u2019m not a \u201cno plot just vibes\u201d kind of reader. please tell me i\u2019m not alone or it gets better i love when it picks up but that only happens like every 30 chapters or maybe i am just too dumb to get it idk",

However, Maas just isn't that good with plot, so in the end it fell very flat and isn't worth it at all if you struggle with other facets of her writing. The FOMO is hard, but if you're not feeling her writing style and you have other series you want to try, I'd recommend dropping it.",

    "postText": "Shit. I don't know if it's because my life is currently stressful therefore my emotional threshold is at an all-time low, but this is one of the most gut-wrenching books, most devastating, beautifully written books I've read in a very long time. \n\nI'm only a couple chapters in and I've gone through many a tissue paper. At the very least, this book has inspired to me study for my own medical board exams and do what I can do for the world around me.",

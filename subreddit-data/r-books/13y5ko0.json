The fact that the bills' constitutionality is questionable (at best) is a feature, not a bug. \n\nThe goal is to push people that they view as \"undesirable\" back into the shadows or out of their state. The law doesn't have to stand up to a legal challenge, because the intended damage will already be done long before that process can be settled. The threat of financial ruin, reputation damage, or unemployability (*in addition to* the uncertain legal outcome) are effective enough on their own. \n\nDoctors can't risk performing even *legal* abortions or gender affirming care without risking their livelihoods or freedom. Education Boards can't risk supporting or tenuring LGBTQ+ teachers because crippling legal fees and potential fines are always one Karen away. People who dress in Drag can't do so in public, because children are allowed in public, and anything can be considered a \"performance\". \n\nCongress needs to pass a law requiring a judicial constitutionality review before a bill can be signed into law. These laws are circumventing due process and weaponizing the cost and inefficiencies of the judicial system as a punishment unto itself.\n\n\nETA - I'm aware that the whole \"bills need judicial review\" proposal raises its own mountain of issues vis-a-vis the separation of powers, judicial overreach, and is probably *more* prone to corruption than our current system if implemented poorly. It's more that I want us to fix the loophole in the system, not that I think that proposal is a miracle cure for it.",

But the fact that those objections could cost millions of dollars and take years of perseverance until a final (uncertain) ruling can be made by the Supreme Court is the loophole that empowers these bills in the first place. \n\nIt's the \"firehose of falsehood\" technique applied to legislation. The time and effort to *create* a discriminatory law is far *far* less than the time, effort, and money it takes to overturn it. \n\nTake Alabama's attempts at criminalizing homelessness, for instance. The SPLC recently (like, maybe 3-4 weeks ago?) won a legal battle that started around Feb 2020, ruling that Alabama's laws that criminalized \"Begging\" violate the first amendment and are unconstitutional. A little over **a week later**, the legislature passed a bill amending the definition of \"loitering\" to include \"begging or fundraising\" and expanded the enforcement jurisdiction to include all \"public right-of-way\" areas (under bridges, on sidewalks, in alleyways, near any road, etc).  So, after 3 years of litigation, thousands of man-hours and dollars spent, and a favorable outcome in the eyes of the law... The ban on Panhandling/Begging was overturned for like 8 days.\n\nSo now they've got a few years to come up with the *next* clever legally-distinct-but-functionally-identical bill to maintain the status-quo. Rinse and repeat.",

It shouldn't be other people deciding who can read to them. \n\nFor example, I hate all the fucking churches because I think they are indoctrinating people with falsehoods and creating toxic communities that shield abuse of all kinds; and yet I do not think I get to decide if other people can take their kids to church. I do not get to decide what things churches can read to children.\n\nThis is the same thing. Let parents raise their kids. I won't fight to keep your kids from having to endure church. You shouldn't be fighting to tell me how to raise mine.",

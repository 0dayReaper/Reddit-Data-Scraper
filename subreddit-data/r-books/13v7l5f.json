The girl in question grew up and was still living at the time of the publication of Emerson's book, but certain parts of her troubled teenage life match the character Sparks created for Go Ask Alice, and Emerson felt confident this particular person was at least the starting point for Go Ask Alice (though unlike Sparks and the Alden Barrett debacle, Emerson at least has the decency to obfuscate and not reveal her real identity while drawing the parallels he found in his research).",

Once he said it's as simple as \"A causes B\", so many desperate and confused parents latched onto that as something to fight against where nothing previously existed.  The average person can't really \"fight\" autism in any sort of meaningful way, but vaccines...  They provide a clear and very specific target to direct your anger and frustrations at while also making you feel like you're doing something.  It didn't really matter how much Wakefield was fully and incontrovertibly discredited, because they didn't want to go back to not knowing and feeling helpless.  (And, it's just unfortunate how much that has spread far and wide, poisoning discourse over certain things.)\n\nIt just comes down to people want simple and easy answers when the reality is often difficult or not clear cut.  It's why conspiracies abound. Some people would rather accept a fiction that gives them what they want rather than a reality that doesn't make sense.",

In fact, according to the mental health forum I visited, it's rarely multiple personalities.  More often it's something like a person dissociating regularly during stressful times, and sometimes it isn't noticeable to others.  Their conscious part of their brain simply turns off, even if they continue to act as normal.  Other times, they appear to zone out.",

Then really bad when I was around 17. She kicked me out of the house at 18,  and my grandma had to move in to take care of her and my sister a few months later. \n\nOf course this is all me looking back because I didn\u2019t know, but she would just do bizarre shit all the time. Like, one day she bent over and asked me to spank her, that was weird. She set up an appointment for me to see a counselor once and when I got to the address she sent it was the gynecologist (I\u2019m a dude, lol). Or when she kicked me out, like 15 minutes before I had to leave she started crying and asking why I was abandoning her. \n\nWhen I saw the house shortly before she died the electricity had just been turned off, there was dog shit everywhere, etc. the place was just sad.\n\nI remember looking through her stuff afterwards and one of the spookiest parts was some of her paperwork would be normal stuff that would  go back and forth between almost different writing styles. Some of which were basically just kid writing with misspelled words and stuff. Sprinkled in every now and then would be \u201cHelp me\u201d.\n\nOn the day to day before it got bad I thought she was just drunk all the time (she definitely had a drinking problem). She\u2019d just do typical alcoholic shit like seem to forget stuff, miss appointments, and not take care of herself. Sometimes she\u2019d just be my normal mom though.",

I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve mentioned this somewhere before on Reddit (so it\u2019s somewhere in my comment history) - having spent time with these individuals, not just as friends but as fellow trauma survivors - faking DID is legitimately one of the most disgusting and dangerous things someone can do. \n\nIt\u2019s disgusting because it trivializes exactly what someone went through in order for DID to develop - the level of trauma it takes for DID to manifest in a person\u2026DID is a survival mechanism. It happens because someone\u2019s brain can\u2019t handle the amount of abuse that is happening, so the psyche breaks off into pieces. \n\nAnd that\u2019s how faking DID is dangerous - being flippant about something so serious, and so rare: only 1.5-2% of the entire world\u2019s population  is estimated to have DID.\n\nI\u2019ve listened to people\u2019s trauma stories that have caused their DID. I\u2019ve lived with them for days at a time, and observed how their personalities changed. The people that are faking DID have NO IDEA what they are doing, because people with DID don\u2019t act any different than anyone else; the exaggerated personalities the fakers are showing off aren\u2019t \u2018true to life,\u2019 they\u2019re more \u2018made for TV,\u2019 and made to be hurtful.\u201d",

I was diagnosed with DID and complex PTSD over a decade ago and have had fugue experiences as well as DPDR, and dissociative seizures. So when I have been able to read more to try and understand it all outside of therapy/hospital, it's been focused on that rather than the other dissociative disorders.  The misinformation out there is ridiculous and tbh, and the ever growing  \"popularity\" of it is distressing, especially when it bleeds directly into treatment/healthcare. It's been growing for well over a decade. When I was diagnosed any term relating to \"triggers\" were trauma specific and known by very few, to the point I'd often have to explain it to general mental health staff, now it's everywhere and applies to so much its meaningless. The frequency of use of other trauma based terms terms like dissociation, and gaslighting have all gone along the same path. It's frustrating that the language originally used is now meaningless, so often minimised and ignored even in mental health settings. It really reads \"everyone's a little bit autistic/adhd though\". \n\nAs it didn't ever apply to me, I haven't tried to remember all the details of OSDD/DDNOS(1/1a). I was under the impression Dissociation, DPDR and Dissociative fugue, were standalone disorders as well as symptoms, depending on their severity. And that dpdr and dissociation especially were a symptom of many mental health conditions from the more obvious PTSD (from both simple and complex traumas) and BPD, to more commonly occurring depression and anxiety disorders and even the every day experience to a lesser degree, when the person is subjected enough stress.\n\nRegardless if you're looking for more information, I'd recommend PODS, which is a charity in the UK focused on helping those with Dissociative disorders, and is very good in emphasising the lost important thing about DID, and that is that the overwhelming majority of those with DID are covert in presentation, not florid and over exaggerated to the patient or those around them.",

I don\u2019t know of many relevant scholars who believe in DID in the sense of someone having two or more fully developed personality states that are separated by fugue and dissociative amnesia. There are certainly people who have a hard time integrating different emotional states into a stable self-identity, and who experience high levels of  dissociative symptoms (namely derealization and depersonalization), but the mapping of those people onto the classical picture of DID is iffy. Indeed, the entire Dissociative Disorders section of the DSM is pretty scant on evidence, and is a very common topic of complaint by scholars who study dissociation.\n\nThe sociocognitive perspective is much (much, much) more robustly supported by the data than is the traumatogenic perspective.\n\nIndeed, dissociative amnesia itself is a poorly-supported phenomenon that actually contradicts much of what we know about memory formation and retrieval, and the neurophysiological mechanisms which would be required to even support the traditional model of DID is wildly different from any evidence-based model we have. There just isn\u2019t much support from the clinical or basic scientific literature to support the idea that DID (multiple distinct personality states \u201coccupying\u201d the same physical brain but separated by fugue, with psychogenic amnesia that is inconsistent with normal forgetting) is \u201creal.\u201d\n\nOne simple thought experiment: if severe trauma can somehow cause chronic dissociative symptoms (not acute, as in PTSD) to the point of people experiencing psychogenic amnesia of those events and forming alters to deal with them, then where are all the prisoners of war with DID? Where are the political refugees fleeing war-torn countries with DID? Where were all the Holocaust survivors with DID? Even if you think DID has to be formed in childhood, where are the children who survived these kinds of horrific events (refugees of war, genocide survivors, etc.) who grew up to have DID and/or dissociative amnesia? Why is it that, contrary to the traumatogenic perspective, all the science supports that trauma is associated not with amnesia, but with remembering too well? And if dissociative amnesia does occur, why are alters necessary? Isn\u2019t the amnesia itself enough to accomplish the task of not remembering one\u2019s trauma? Where are these alters and their memories stored? Where do they \u201cgo\u201d when not active? Memories are just neuronal pathways, after all, and we know the data aren\u2019t consistent with a psychoanalytic formulation of a deep subconscious well of autobiographical content. Why are all of these DID cases (the ones professionally diagnosed, not the ones on TikTok) almost exclusively in Western nations and almost exclusively among people who also have very clear cluster B symptoms and would meet criteria for BPD or HPD? Is it not more simply explanatory that these are people with clear identity instability consistent with a cluster B PD who have been inadvertently (or in some cases intentionally) misdiagnosed and coached into believing they have multiple personalities? After all, people diagnosed with DID are by far and away the clinical population with the highest average trait suggestibility.\n\nhttps://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-57878-005\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721411429457?journalCode=cdpa\n\nhttps://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-081219-102424",

I don't think 1.5% is representative (although I have challenges with prevalence rates of many of the Dx as reported by the DSM) of the population at large.\n\nMy theoretical formulation for DID is more along the lines of an extreme fight/flight reaction, essentially a chronic and static dissociative response to trauma.  I think the manifestation is similar in nature to how \"typical\" people may engage in escapism, fantasy, fetishes, etc... to find relief from the everyday stresses of the the real world.  On a more functional level, this could be playing D&amp;D to various levels of commitment, to obsession with anime, to sports fanaticism...to almost whatever.  I've had a teen with a loaded trauma history who started out escaping into anime.  As she found getting involved in that world she developed an online avatar for forums that emerged into a persona that turned into more of her life involvement than school and the \"real world\".  As she aged the anime turned into K-pop, and when I started working with her she was convinced she was going to move to Korea and become a K-pop star.  She never got to a DID state, imo, but I think it was on the spectrum to that.  As we worked together, she was able to start integrating the two \"identities\" (herself and her K-pop self) and in high school was taking dance classes, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean language classes, and joined choir.  As the integration continued, she began to express that she realized becoming a K-pop star was not realistic for various reasons and then decided to work towards becoming a flim/makeup stylist for a K-pop agency.  She graduated high school and entered beauty school and got a job at a stylist.  Through the integration she was able to bring the two identities back into a cohesive self-concept over time.  While this is not DID, imo, it shows the spectrum and how it exists for all of us to some degree so we can look at an actual DID case.\n\nChildhood sexual abuse survivor (father at age 2+, teacher in middle school who would abuse her at lunch after opening the emergency door to the outside so snow could blow in and cover the classroom floor before laying her down on it, etc...)  This trauma was/is so overwhelming she had to escape the real world and mentally retreated into an escapism identity.  As this vertical split in her psyche solidified, she cut of the original identity significantly in order to amputate the trauma wounds, if you will.  However, since the abuse kept happening (and she was groomed to become vulnerable to future abuse as well), the new identity now had to be fled from as well and 3rd identity began to develop.  So on and so on.  Fast forward to her 30s and she reached a crisis point and during an inpatient stay the repressed memories began surfacing through the vertical splits to the \"self\".  She's been doing great work and working towards integration and expresses a knowledge that her \"alters\" are compartmentalized memories/experiences sealed off for emotional protection.  \n\nSo yeah, I absolutely think DID is a thing, but there is a natural and reasonable explanation of what it really is, which is not the sensationalized concept of DID is.\n\nI understand skepticism of it and all also, as culturally it is a thing we've now collectively been taught \"it's okay to claim this to get sympathy\" and individuals may mask their protective behaviors as this form of adaptation.",

I don\u2019t doubt at all that there are people with severe DP/DR experiences and some degree of personality/identity instability, but the empirical literature strongly suggests DID to be misdiagnosed cluster B pathology with a high degree of cultural and/or therapeutic suggestion to boot. Hell, there are robust studies showing no identifiable differences between supposed personality states on standardized tests; studies showing no objective memory dysfunction among those with supposed dissociative amnesia or DID (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/21677026211018194?journalCode=cpxa) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005791604000953); studies showing that the extreme majority of DID cases meet criteria for a cluster B disorder; studies showing that those with DID diagnoses constitute the most suggestible subpopulation in all of psychiatry, strongly implying an openness to sociocognitive conditioning and iatrogenic pressure (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763422002408); and the very notion of dissociative amnesia itself is just a repacking of the repressed memory stuff that has been thoroughly debunked and doesn\u2019t mesh with neuroscience. I don\u2019t at all doubt that there are people who for some reason *look* like DID to some clinicians, but the objective literature very much casts doubt upon the ontology of the diagnosis. It\u2019s just really, really difficult to mesh the science with the proposed diagnosis and even harder to get on board with a diagnosis that has historically been handed out by such a small and devoted group of clinicians.",

Especially with all the disbelief in DID makes it even harder to diagnose. It\u2019s usually more subtle than it\u2019s depicted in stories. Most people just deal with it in the same way people ignore signs of severe bodily illness. We adapt and keep moving. \n\nTotally anecdotal, but just to offer an example I know a woman who has episodes that look like she\u2019s possessed by a spirit of her step dad - a man who abused her and then later killed himself while she was in the apartment. When she gets these attacks, her voice changes and her arms and face will start contorting. When \u201che\u201d talks her voice is much deeper and takes a different intonation and tells her he\u2019s in control and more than once used her hands to touch her body. She is consciously present for the entire thing and able to discuss the helplessness and frustrating loss of control. Sometimes she can talk during the episode when \u201che\u201d isn\u2019t talking. There isn\u2019t any reason to believe she\u2019s faking. There isn\u2019t a benefit to it, it\u2019s all just horrifying. She\u2019s a hardworking single mom who only has trouble keeping a job if he starts triggering at work. I think it actually triggers most when she is alone - which is a characteristic of the original abuse. It\u2019s debilitating and painful and embarrassing for her.  But doctors won\u2019t believe or treat her because they say she\u2019s lying and it won\u2019t trigger when they are around. She can\u2019t afford or access therapy or specialists because doctors won\u2019t make the referral so it would be covered by insurance. Only the church believes her and she\u2019s had exorcisms that did not work because well\u2026 it\u2019s not a possession. To me it seems like she\u2019s reliving abuse she already endured. You could meet her and never know unless it happens in front of you. She\u2019s a perfectly pleasant and intelligent, normal person who has tried her best to get help and now just lives with it. \n\nThat\u2019s the level of trauma we are talking about where it\u2019s happening in people who seem otherwise normal and there are a lot of people who have been through something that severe. And I think most cases that fit the criteria are more subtle than this example. Like say, someone who gets blackout drunk and becomes \u201canother person\u201d.",

That would mean that some 18% of people in the UK with any type of mental health disorder have DID.\n\nThis is madness talking. \n\nI am sure that most people with a real DID diagnoses have real mental health problems, but those problems are not DID because DID is comic book nonsense. There is no evidence that it exists. A tiny minority of psychologists hand out the diagnosis. (Which, incidentally, makes your 1.5%-2% number even more insane ... because that population, by necessity, would almost entirely be in California. 1 billion people with DID do not live in California or even in the US - even if it were real. Which it is not.)\n\nPersonality change is *not* DID. Radical personality change is not DID. Everyone with CPTSD/PTSD has DID? Or is it more likely that DID is, in reality, a bad diagnosis and these people have CPTSD/PTSD/BPD/etc. Hell, pro-social narcissists with no other mental health issues have wild personality shifts, sometimes minute-to-minute.\n\nI guarantee you that 99% of 'DID' is down to iatrogenesis. 99% of that is not unintentional, either.",

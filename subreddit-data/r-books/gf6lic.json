I could have been ok with that since Middle Earth is pretty indulgent and there's liberties to be had with the Necromancer of Mirkwood foreshadowing and such.  \n\n\nBut the studio decided it wanted box office revenue for 3 movies, so they thinned out these plot points into 3 movies and filled in the gaps with nonsensical romance subplots and extended gaudy CGI scenes.  These type of scenes are fast and relatively cheap so they can be quickly shoehorned, but other pieces of the movie take more work that cannot be rushed, such as Howard Shore's score for the movie.  This is why we see some cheap scrambling in parts, such as Howard Shore's ringwraith theme being re-used for Throin's showdown with Azog ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyO2z4Ge8M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyO2z4Ge8M) ).",

Lindsey Ellis did a great series dissecting the production of these movies, and there\u2019s tons of great info there. Basically, like 6 big production companies were involved in making the original trilogy, and all of them were promised royalties if a Hobbit movie was ever made. Once Warner Brothers got around to making it, everyone from before wanted a pice of the pie. So they did the math, and they realized that by splurging more money on a third movie, they would end up earning a bigger profit once everything was split. \n\nOf course, this was after it was decided for it to be made into two movies, and Peter Jackson got the news immediately before shooting was supposed to start. So that was fun. Seriously, that man went through hell on those movies.",

Not scenes where liberties were taken with the material, but scenes that didn\u2019t work cinematically because then went on so long as to become meaningless.",

After realizing the world with such serious detail in LOTR, it would be really difficult to make the Hobbit films feel more slight in comparison because there's still a lot that happens. Visually, what would be happening on screen wouldn't really be \"less sense\" than LOTR, even if it's described with less detail.\n\nBut I think they had a built-in excuse that they didn't use. The Hobbit is often more from Bilbo's perspective, and so you can focus it that way instead of having to follow a bunch of almost-equal-in-importance characters like in LOTR.",

There's a reason that a picture is worth a thousand words.\n\n\n\"No gaps between dialogue\" but you do have identifiers on who and how everything is said, as well as character reactions to dialogue, all of which have to be written instead of just observed.\n\n\nYou're also assuming the wrong way for actions and establishing shots. Sure those take time, but books have to describe it. How long does the movie take to describe sting? Now compare it to the book. On shot versus a paragraph.",

Guys like GRRM have chapters upon chapters that could have been trimmed out of the story he's telling. Jordan has entire books that could have been.\n\nThere is no world in which Crossroads of Twilight needs to exist. Half the damn book is just characters reacting to the more interesting shit that took place in the previous book, and that's the only thing that managed to happen in that one.",

He was the primary influencer on all things Tolkien; he poured over thousands of pages of JRRs notes to create books like The Silmarillion, Children of Hurin, Fall of Gondolin, Beren and Luthien, and more. The man was a legend and he loved his fathers work more than anyone. The Hobbit was written by JRR for Christopher as a bedtime story. You can only imagine how much these stories meant to him. \n\nHe was avidly against movies and adaptations. The only reason these LOTR and Hobbit movies were made was because JRR sold the rights for the cartoon version before he died. He even called out the movies on how poorly executed he thought they were.\n\nNot even three months after Christopher stepped down as head of the Tolkien estate, the new head sold the rights of LOTR to Amazon to make a TV show, and made a lot of money doing it. It\u2019s a middle finger to Christopher, as his whole life he tried to preserve his fathers legacy, which he believed needed to stay within the books.\n\nR.I.P. Christopher. Tolkien\u2019s world would not be what it is today without your hard work.",

The Lord of the Rings movies were excellent, but a whole lot of variables had to go right for them to end up so good.

Do exactly that all over again.\"\n\nConsider all the awful adaptations of fantasy novels out there.

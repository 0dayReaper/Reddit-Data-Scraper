    "postText": "I am 60 (out of \\~300) pages into Book Lovers by Emily Henry and I simply do not get the hype. Like nothing is problematic or so horridly written that my gag reflex gets triggered but the writing seems so...middle school? Like it sounds so generic and reminds me of a very well written Wattpad book and while there's absolutely nothing wrong with that, I do not get why it is liked so widely. \n\nI've read other romance novels and the ones I liked most were bc of the banter and angst but this book is so cliche and &gt;!the initial bit about the defence for the implied utopia of Sunshine Falls sounds like a preempted defence to the actual story (which is sort of piss-offy in that an author should not have to address a void in their work through a shabby take within the book). !&lt;\n\nAgain, I don't hate the book but I'm so lost on why the author has gained such massive popularity when the writing style can be described as mid at best.",

            "comment": "You sort of have to look at Emily Henry's writing against that of other contemporary romance authors; while I agree that her books are obviously cliche and hardly elevated prose, she writes better books than most of her peers who write for the same genre and demographic. \n\nI saw you mention Leigh Bardugo in another comment, that's exactly the kind of author you can't compare Emily Henry to because Bardugo is just a *way* better writer. The best YA is probably better than most popular contemporary romance. I'm not hating on the romance genre at all, it's just that its readers specifically want predictability and tropes and things that aren't difficult to read and a focus on relationships over plot, which makes for easy reading but mid writing. But if you compared Emily Henry to like, Ali Hazelwood or Colleen Hoover, you'd probably conclude Emily's much better than they are.",

I just believe there have to better writers writing simple predictable plot while also not treating their readers like infants :/",

My daughter\u2019s friend explained to me that she loves Henry\u2019s books because they\u2019re a brainless read, comforting and familiar. I hate them because I think the banter is sooo fake, I feel like I know the ending after the first chapter, and I just hate everything about her writing.",

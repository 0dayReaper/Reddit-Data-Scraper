    "postText": "I just finished this lovely book and can't stop thinking of the importance of the topics it covered.  Broadly it is about taking children away from their parents as a form of \\[political\\] leverage.  It covered so many additional issues as well.\n\nDoes ignoring an injustice makes you in part complicit?\n\nIs the protection of your immediate family more important than the safety and well -being of others?\n\nHow \"protecting children\" from ideas, beliefs, and/or information can weaken a society.\n\nThe importance of a free exchange of ideas. And stories.  And poems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the book to be well written and incredibly thought provoking.  I thought of how we teach 1984, Lord of the Flies, To Kill a Mockingbird, Diary of a Young Girl, and similar books in high school not only as examples of good literature but also to help our developing minds/next generation see plausible futures and possible outcomes from actions/inactions.  I think it would be a wonderful addition to high school literature or even history classes since taking children has been a tactic used globally over time.\n\nI would love to discuss this book with those who have read it.  What did you think of the topic?  Do you think it would work in a high school curriculum?",

            "comment": "Celeste Ng is one of my favorite authors. None of her books have disappointed me. You should definitely check out her other two novels if you haven't. \n\nI really enjoyed Our Missing Hearts. It could definitely work in a high school curriculum, though it's so clearly connected to recent/current events that these days it feels like half the country would be looking to ban it instead of talk about it.\n\nI liked that it wasn't a big story. It's not about a hero making everything good again. It just felt like this really realistic look at where certain ideas and policies could take us. It felt very real, which is something I think Ng has always excelled at - characters and stories that feel very real.",

There was a similar feel in Little Fires Everywhere: That was also not a big story but equally  emotional and gripping.\n\nYou are right!  I had not reflected on the lack of a hero.  I like that it gave the representation of \"every little bit helps.\" That every sign or symbol can push a movement forward.  Where we don't need a hero as much as we need everyone to be part of the solution.  Or at the very least not turning a blind eye.",

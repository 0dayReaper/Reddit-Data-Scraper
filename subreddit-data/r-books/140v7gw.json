What gets me is that this book is 50 years old, and basically every batshit idea is still a part of the modern zeitgeist.",

It also heavily incorporated commentary about the struggles of Indigenous people and the legacy of European colonialism. \n\nTwo thirds into the book the author made COVID 19 and the BLM protests take part in the book and it was really jarring. I got the impression that the author was really affected by these things and decided she wanted to write about them when they were topical but it made the book feel really disjointed. It felt like she wanted the book to be released quickly because of the issues in the book and it could have used more editing to make all the themes and events more coherent. It felt like 2 separate stories being forced to coexist in the same novel",

Most really recent books avoid setting their story during lockdown, which lasted a lot longer than 9/11, in order to focus on whatever the book is actually about. Those that do are kind of obnoxious because as far as I can tell, they mostly involve a plotline where a bunch of people with relationships with each other are stuck in a nice big house together, so they're not starved for either space or human contact, and basically the same plot could've been achieved by putting them in an island or mountain vacation getaway a la Ruth Ware or Lucy Foley. But most avoid that trauma trigger and political landmine, and rightly so imo. Just because someone can write a novel doesn't mean their political musings are interesting, especially if their social niche is one that pressures people into having the same opinions about everything. And I don't expect an established literary fiction author like Erdrich, entrenched enough in the system to get a Pulitzer in 2021, to have a single thought about the events of 2020 that wouldn't fit comfortably on NPR.",

They work on decoding it and trying to see if there is any meaning, or if it's just noise.\n\nI don't have the words to describe how every aspect of the entire book goes completely wild from there.  What is in the signal, what it implies, how people respond, what is on the moon, what is told about history... and it only escalates from there to things like &gt;!people gaining the ability to teleport inside others to murder them, literal ideas fighting with each other or wanting to procreate, entire civilizations fleeing sentient stars!&lt;\n\nBut even that's not all.  The book itself goes wild, with crazy fonts, words falling down on the page, gaps in the text itself indicating what's happening, sentences spanning across pages rather than sticking to the same one and so much more.\n\nAnd somehow that doesn't come close to all of it, with fourth wall breaking, hell even the table of contents making a surprise appearance.\n\nAnd what I'd consider the general theme of the book makes you uncomfortable to recommend it in such an amazing, meta way too.\n\nAll starting from a simple sci-fi tale of trying to decipher some data that some radio telescopes picked up.",

I don't necessarily love or hate it, and I appreciate how the first book opens up the representation of mental health issues from there onward. However, one moment I'm reading a fae romance Beauty and the Beast retelling and the next &gt;! it's some sort of horror film torture porn. It came legitimately out of nowhere, and reading this teenage girl do this for a guy who sits and stares (and spends their one moment together in captivity trying to fuxk?) It was a blindside and it felt like SJM decided to write a new story halfway through, but didn't want to write the beginning over. !&lt;",

Is a completely grounded horror novel for the first 90% of it then goes completely supernatural in the finale with no adequate setup.

If you want magic, pick Viy or \"evernings on a farm near Dikanka\" for example.  \n\nDead Souls is more of an odyssey-like fable about a man travelling and meeting various extremely exaggerated characters, mostly in terms of their various aspects of greed. One who is a pathological hoarder, one who immediately tries to rise prices by advertising his dead people as \"the highest quality dead people you can get anywhere\", the third is indecisive and stuck thinking - I'm getting profit by selling something that I only have on paper, but am I getting *enough* profit?  \n\nAnd, of course, the main character is running a scam based on cheaply buying documents of unreported dead serfs, to fake being richer than he actually is.    \n\n(And only 1 volume exists out of planned 3 - the 2nd one was allegedly destroyed intentionally or by accident, and the 3rd never started, the man pulled the whole \"abandoned project\" long before Kingkiller and ASOIAF were cool.)\n\np.s. Souls is used to mean people, as is pretty common in an old-school way, similar to SOS being short for \"save our souls\".  \nLike \"...per capita\" in english literally means per head if you translate it, in slavic languages this expression goes literally \"...per soul\"  \nAnd, I guess, in a way it's also a pun about all the main characters being \"dead inside\" so to say, by still trying to profit even in unsavory ways.",

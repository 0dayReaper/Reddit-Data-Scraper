    "postText": "I can engage in conversation with Feynman, Plato, Darwin, Penrose and Buddha through reading books.\n\nBooks indeed provide an extraordinary opportunity to engage with the greatest minds of the past and present. Through the written word, we can access the knowledge, ideas, and perspectives of brilliant individuals from different eras and cultures. Books serve as a means of communication across time, enabling us to delve into the minds of philosophers, scientists, writers, and thinkers who have shaped our understanding of the world. I can communicate with those writers by expressing my agreement or disagreement with their ideas, concepts, and books, much like engaging in a friendly conversation. It's fascinating to consider that most writers invest great care in crafting their books, ensuring that every word and idea is thoughtfully presented. As a result, reading their works goes beyond simple conversation (chat).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't imagine any other activities that can provide this level of engagement.",

            "comment": "It's a sentiment writers have expressed, including one I have a special soft spot for, Louis-S\u00e9bastien Mercier. He was passionate about literature and it means a lot to me to know he felt that and often seems to have had it on his mind. I think there is a difference between the feel of that, say, Rousseau with his chatty style, aimed at provoking a response from contemporary readers (which I suspect was part of his popularity and why contemporaries can write as if they knew him even if they didn't. He pre-empts disagreement and seems to encourage it at times), and Mercier's utopian novel, set in the far future - he's also wanting to address contemporaries but thinking about posterity, including the future of literature, which of his favs will be seen as worth reading (big Voltaire fan!). There are scenes evoking the idea of connection across time, it's lovely. Still, writing of this sort being constructed with the expectation of a 'general' (depending on the expectations of the period and individual writer. Mercier wanted everyone to read) audience, also means the view we get of the writer is with them having been aware of that.\n\nThere can be more intimacy, sometimes uncomfortably, to reading letters (at least depending on the purpose of the letters in question, some may have had publication in mind). There is recorded speech as well. I've visited a few writer's houses, with the Bronte sisters' Haworth Parsonage having been especially memorable (darn that hill. Also very much reccomend reading their letters to anyone interested in them). Being physically in the space is different even to having seen a photograph, objects can be meaningful/touching as well.\n\nI learnt French wanting to understand the revolution and revolutionaries better (the two things are really inseparable), but even with daunting amounts of text of various kinds (fiction, political writing, newspapers, letters, parliamentary minutes and documents, accounts of varying reliability, personal books and lists of them) trying to get 'closer' in that way is even more overwhelming in terms of just how much is lost, how much you can't know. Of course this is different across different periods (it's made me see photographs of ninteenth century writers with new eyes. Portraits though are also a form of communication and could be designed to convey information to the viewer. And we have recordings of more recent writers, like Virginia Woolf, then video of Sartre - we don't always have to imagine what them having a conversation is like) and circumstances. I was previously more interested in medieval lit at university, and we can be 'lucky' to know a writer's name. Can we think we know the Pearl poet from the few personal details we guess at from the text? In comparison for the eighteenth century there's a lot and for me though I'll always have the interest, it's hard to go back. In other ways there isn't, and, as is obvious in a book set in a utopian future, there's the things beyond their imagination (Mercier imagines support for widows and orphans. He was right, but couldn't have anticipated that there'd hardly be any to need it in modern France. He depicts a sound recording device, which is pretty amazing, but no video). Writing, including writing now, is a bit like a snapshot of someone in one moment, from a certain angle. Writers can very much contradict themselves and change over time and moment to moment.\n\nI think in a way part of what looking more deeply at historical individuals has done, is that fictional characters feel less adequate as a way to convey the complexity of an individual - besides that glimpse of the writer.",

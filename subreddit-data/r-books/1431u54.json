    "postText": "TLDR: After reading recursion I\u2019m finding it difficult to connect with Dark Matter and finishing after just the first few chapters. \n\nAs cliche as it sounds my New Year\u2019s resolution in 2023 was the get back into reading. I randomly found a post on this sub recommending the book \u2018The Martian\u2019 I read it and loved it and then read \u2018Project Hail Mary\u201d and again LOVED it. \n\nThen I found a post saying something similar to \u2018if you liked PHM you\u2019ll like Blake Crouch specifically recursion and dark matter.\u2019 So I read Recursion and couldn\u2019t put it down. Read it in 3 days. \n\nThen I started Dark Matter. I\u2019m only a few chapters in. I just can\u2019t\u2026connect. The characters seem very, very 1 dimensional. I find myself not invested in them at all, not like how I was with recursion. I\u2019m bummed but also trying to push through. Did anyone read this book and have a hard time with it and first but kept going and glad they did?",

Here are some of my favorites you could try next:\n\n* The Breach by Patrick Lee\n* Timeline by Michael Crichton\n* Delta-V by Daniel Suarez\n* Runner by Patrick Lee\n* Event by David Lynn Golemon\n* Ice Station by Matthew Reilly\n* Our Lady of the Artilects by Andrew Gillsmith\n* Beneath the Dark Ice by Greig Beck\n\nRegarding Dark Matter, I definitely preferred Recursion. I remember it and think about it, but don't with Dark Matter. But maybe stick with it a bit longer?",

Dark Matter blooms after the two main characters enter \u201cthe box\u201d. (trying not to spoil here). \n\nI think the first few chapters seem really simple at first, but the quest to return to that simplicity gives it a whole new coat of paint. I think you can consider Crouches \u201cformula\u201d to be like so:\n\nLife-altering tech gets created\n\nTech causes issues in protagonists life\n\nThings get turned UP TO 100 REAL QUICK.\n\n\nThis is true for Dark Matter, Recursion, and Upgrade, his newest novel. Enjoy!",

Not to spoil too much, but after a certain point it feels like it morphs from science fiction novel into a comic book being told in the format of a novel. More details (with minor spoilers): &gt;!The main character is just the most boring anti-villain that we're for some reason supposed to root for. While the main \"villain\" is more like a cartoon villain character with noble goals that doesn't care about the price of victory. I found myself rooting for the villain!&lt;",

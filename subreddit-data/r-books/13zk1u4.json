If you force yourself to read it, now you've lost both the money *and* your free time that you could have enjoyed doing something else. It's wiser to quit when you've only lost the money.\n\nAlso, is there a reason why you're purchasing books instead of getting them out from the library? It might be worth to get a library card, then read the books when they're available through your library. If you find you want to own it because you're really enjoying it, you can always buy the book afterward.\n\nFurthermore, I'd say the most avid readers I know are the same people who dnf the most books. They say if they tried to finish more books, they'd be reading fewer books because they'd be slogging through them more slowly. Instead, they give themselves permission to sample lots of books. When they find books they want to read, they get through them rather quickly because they're enjoying the reading.",

So basically never count out a book forever if there's even a little bit you find appealing.\n\n2.

You could spend the rest of your life only reading books that were released last month alone, and you'd never be able to read them all. \n\nLife is too short to waste on something you don't enjoy doing, especially when that takes time away from reading books you could enjoy. \n\nI used to feel bad about DnF:ing books too, but then I just accepted the fact that not everything appeals to everyone and it's perfectly okay to move forward. Now, I unapologetically toss a book if it fails to impress me within the first 50 pages or so. Sometimes even faster, if it's evident I won't be enjoying it.\n\nYou might think that with this approach, you'll end up with a million unfinished books, but it's actually the opposite! After embracing this style, I read much more books in a year than I did before. When I was struggling with a book I didn't really want to pick up, it took me *months* to crawl through it sometimes. Now, reading only books that I find entertaining , I devour them in a few days and move on to the next. No more struggling for months at a time.",

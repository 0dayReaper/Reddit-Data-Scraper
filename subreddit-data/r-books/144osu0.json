The 2016 Baseball World Series saw the Cleveland (then) Indians blow a 3-1 best-of-seven series lead to the Chicago Cubs. \n\n\n*The Sparrow* was published in 1996, so it seems that Russell correctly predicted the 2016 World Series 20 years before it happened.",

One of those weird bits of coincidence. Maybe inspired by Cleveland losing a couple World Series in the 1990s? Including 1995, I think?",

It was very interesting, and i enjoyed a lot of the chapters, and learned a lot of information, but it seems like 10 minutes to read two pages. I don't even know why, just some slow chapters i guess. Anyway, this got me curious about some of your guys' DNFs (did not finish.)",

There's nothing wrong with YA, but if something is billed as adult fantasy and I'm in the mood for such a book, I want to be sure it's actually adult fantasy. \n\nIt's not even necessarily the age of the characters, though that can be a factor, but the overall vibe and maturity. E.g., Fitz in Assassin's Apprentice is a literal child, not even a teen, but that's absolutely an adult fantasy novel.",

There's a decent subplot about skin color being a factor in her not being accepted, but that's forgotten about halfway through.\n\nHowever, about 3/4 of the way through, our special magical girl ends up in the middle of one of the worst war crimes of the last century. I'm not exaggerating about \"war crimes\". \n\nThe author literally repeats the R\\*pe of Nanking in her cute little YA novel. \n\nOur plucky protagonist stumbles through infants r\\*ped to death, little girls r\\*ped with bayonets since they were too small, and young women r\\*ped tied with their legs open and bleeding to death. And it's all written out in great Technicolor detail in the middle of a pleasant, if formulaic, YA novel about a magic school.\n\nCould not throw this across the room hard enough.\n\nWhen I got rid of it, I handwrote a warning in the book.",

The book is still decent and offers a couple of pieces the movie doesn't have, but if you really want to consume it but can't get past the weird prose, just watch the movie.\n\nGonna give everything the book will give you so if you have watched the movie and want to know what (if anything) you're missing, see here (edit: be aware I'm spoiler tagging for a reason):\n\n&gt;!The biggest distinction is the name of the narrator. The movie gives us a name, the novel deliberately avoids naming her. Why? Because she's not a real person, she was someone the true protagonist - the dying janitor - met once at a bar and didn't catch her name nor had the courage to pursue in earnest. Thus, in the book she is only ever referred by \"Jake's Girlfriend\" because Jake (the real Jake) is imagining everything in his dying, hypothermic mind. You additionally will see these bizarre dialogues play out with the narrator about her past. They involve phone calls presumably of the monologues the protagonist imagines in his head, or speaks out loud to others. Which bleeds into the next, the segue pages between chapters that give a small, further glimpse into the life of the janitor. These segues are from the perspective of people who knew him and now know he's dead, mostly being staff from the school who saw the janitor and were creeped out or even endeared by his odd, hermit antics. The last point to bring up is the ending. The ending of the movie is a dance number where Jake and narrator dance, but they aren't the same. The protagonist can no longer recall faces well, his body is so far gone that he is losing his grip. In the novel, it's almost a slasher flick where the janitor chases the narrator around the school, and Jake has vanished... because Jake is the janitor and can't be in two places at once. The ending I feel in the movie, despite not being a fan of dance numbers, is way more impacting. The novel's version meanders and almost lets out all of the creativity. It just feels conventional, my own take though.!&lt;\n\nI like both a good deal, but I definitely prefer the movie.",

There were so many characters to keep track of, and they were all annoying, and the plot moved at a glacial pace over an exorbitant number of pages.\n\nI read 4 or 5 other King novels years ago and enjoyed them for the most part, but I think I may have outgrown him. \n\nHis prose is gratingly pedestrian, and\nhis conversational, avuncular, I'm-so-hip narrative style really gets under my skin.\n\nI think King has his merits, the primary ones being his rich imagination and his genius for telling (usually) compelling stories, but man...Under The Dome sucks.",

Over describing the flora and fauna of the environments, countless flashbacks retelling the same things over and over.

The worst part is the author clearly thinks that he's sympathetic but he's an abusive, self serving asshole, who just happens to stumble across crime.

Almost all the characters in this book are absolutely awful, like the worst people (except the 15-year-old, she\u2019s just irritating but hey that\u2019s what you get with a TEENAGER.) I don\u2019t understand how this book got all those prizes and became so popular. \n\nEdit: the story is set in the US, but it\u2019s by a Swiss author. I read his book *The Mystery of Room 622* (I think that is the title in English) that is set in Switzerland and even though the popular opinion seems to be that it\u2019s his worst one, I think the characters in it were so much better than in Harry Quebert.

It was the first book I read after months of not having any time at all (don't come at me with the you can always make time, I literally had about 4 hours per day of time left after commuting, working and sleeping) and so I was pretty excited to get into a heavily recommended book by a heavily recommended author (also really enjoyed the recent Sandman series). \n\nIn the end it took me 4 months to get through about 300 pages before I had to return it to the library. I didn't hate it, it was pretty cool, it just didn't manage to stay in my mind for more than three minutes after putting it down... Shame too because I would love to know what happened, but it was just moving too slowly I suppose.",

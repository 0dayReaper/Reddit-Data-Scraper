    "postText": "I\u2019m almost done with the book and I love it! There is one thing that really bothers me though. \n\nIs the reader supposed to believe the narrator when he says he hit the curate with the butt of the meat chopper? \nI really don\u2019t buy it. I have a lot of reasons as to why, and I\u2019m happy to share, I would just like to know what others think of that detail.\n\n\nLots of spoilers ahead\n\n\n\nThe narrator had spent the days leading up to \u201cthe incident\u201d threatening and beating the curate. His descriptions of the man drip with disgust. On top of that, they\u2019ve been trapped in the ruins of a house together for 6+ days, they have limited food, and the narrator is worried the curate will eat what they have.\n\nWhen the narrator catches the curate eating more of the food, he spends \u201call day and all night\u201d guarding the food, \u201cweary but resolute\u201d while the curate weeps and begs for food. This goes on for *two days*.\n\nI\u2019m trying to keep this short but I also have been thinking about this a lot, sorry.\n\nUltimately the curate realizes he has power over the narrator if he raises his voice, as the narrator doesn\u2019t want the martians nearby to hear them. The curate runs towards the martians. The narrator grabs a nearby meat chopper and runs after him. \u201cWith one last touch of humanity I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt\u201d (133).\n\n\nBasically, given the circumstances and a handful of lines from the book, I don\u2019t believe that last part. I choose to give the narrator the benefit of the doubt on his descriptions of the curate (regardless of how harsh they may be) and on the events leading up to the blow, but I can\u2019t get past this detail. \n\nI would be more than happy to elaborate on any of these points if asked and thank you to anyone who took the time to read this!\n\nEdit because I wasn\u2019t clear, my bad: I do believe that the narrator hit the curate, I just don\u2019t think he actually used the butt of the meat chopper. I don\u2019t normally mistrust the narrator of the books I read but in this case I got the very strong sense that he was trying to convince the reader (and maybe himself) that he only knocked the curate out as opposed to delivering the killing blow.",

I think War of the Worlds was originally written as a serial, so different parts were published at different times. It\u2019s possible there was a bit of a cliffhanger here leaving readers to wonder how the situation would be resolved and if he would kill him or not. That\u2019s my best guess anyway!",

            "comment": "I didn't think it believable either. I think the narrator would have been justified in killing him - the curate was going to get them both killed anyway - and to kill him in a moment of panic would have been plausible. The instinctual urge to grab a weapon to attack the curate only to have a last second change of heart jarred with me.\n\nI'm not sure I see it as the narrator being unreliable so much as maybe Wells not wanting to have his main character go so far as to commit murder. I like your theory though.",

I am very happy to know that I\u2019m not the only one who found that detail strange, so thank you for your comment!\n\nAs for the narrator being unreliable, my interpretation isn\u2019t that he\u2019s intentionally lying, but rather that he can\u2019t accept what he did. He claims that the juxtaposition between the curates personality and his own \u201ckept (him) a sane man\u201d after he admits that \u201cfrom certain vague memories, I am inclined to think my own mind wandered at times\u201d (132). I would argue that he was beginning to lose it by that point as well, but in the days following he rewrote his own memory.",

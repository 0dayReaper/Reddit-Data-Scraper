            "comment": "\u201cCity officials in Orem, Utah, have banned its public library from setting up displays highlighting Pride Month, Black History Month, and Hispanic Heritage Month, along with other heritage-themed holidays. And then they banned librarians from criticizing the city's decision\u2014threatening to discipline them for \"insubordination.\"\n\nBut now, the Utah Library Association (ULA) has threatened to sue, teaming up with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), a First Amendment nonprofit, to warn the city that it could soon face a lawsuit for violating librarians' First Amendment rights.\n\nThe ULA criticized the decision, posting a statement on social media and its website arguing that \"This act of censorship is not only a disservice to the Orem community, but also an act of overreach by the city government\u2026.The library is both a legal and a symbolic embodiment of the fundamental American value that we all have the right to self-direct, think for ourselves, read, learn, and engage with ideas and information without government interference.\"\n\nIn response, the city has retaliated, cutting off library employees from ULA-affiliated professional development programs. Making matters worse, the city outright threatened library employees with discipline if they criticized city officials' censorship of heritage month\u2013themed displays. According to FIRE, when news of the ban went public, city officials even \"conducted a lengthy inquisition among the library staff interrogating them to try to figure out who spoke to a former employee about the policy.\" Eventually, they \"reprimanded one employee and forced them to forgo a raise.\n\nThe Orem Public Library also subjects employees to a restrictive social media policy that bars employees from \"mak[ing] disparaging comments about the workplace, City policies, supervisors, co-workers, citizens, customers, or other persons associated with the City,\" as well as prohibits \"post[ing] any information to any blog, social networking site, or other public internet site, that would discredit or disparage the City.\" In an email to library employees, one former library director pointed out this policy, as well as informing employees \"that membership in the Utah Valley Parent's Alliance, which opposed the display ban, would also be considered insubordination,\" according to FIRE.\n\nBut FIRE contends that these actions clearly violate the First Amendment. \"The City of Orem's actions violate the First Amendment rights of both the ULA and Orem employees,\" FIRE attorney Gabe Walters said in a press release last Friday. \"The city may not retaliate against employees for exercising their constitutionally protected rights of free speech and free association.\"",

He\u2019s walking down the sidewalk when a news crew interviewing random passers-by asks what he thinks of the fire policy, and he says \u201cI don\u2019t like the way they\u2019re handling it, I wish they\u2019d do something more like [neighbouring state].\u201d He\u2019s not wearing a uniform, never mentions that he works for the state or claims to have any official standing on the topic.\n\n2. Friend works for the state fire service as a battalion chief. He gives an interview in uniform, introducing himself with his job title, where he goes into detail about why he thinks the state policy is terrible and how it will lead to horrible disasters. He didn\u2019t get permission from his department before doing the interview.\n\nIn option 1 it would be unconstitutional to punish him. In option 2, they would be absolutely within their rights to fire him.",

Adults too of course but they know they're being shafted.\n\nI cannot fathom, as a queer librarian, being told by my bosses that I need to suppress any kind of content, nevermind my whole ass self as a person. I'm very sorry for everybody with a brain that has to live and work under these conditions. I feel really fortunate to be accepted and supported. I will march with my library system in the pride parade later this month and this will definitely be on my mind.\n\nKnowledge is power, folks. Read!",

The library was about Gay Pride displays, which is AWESOME. Libraries do cultural displays that focus on our plural roots as a country of immigrants and refugees from other places, fleeing poverty and violence/war. These can and should be done.\n\nIf you don't think race plays a factor in a person's life and development then you aren't paying attention. It impacts me and it impacts you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The second you see me, you know more about me than I know about you.**\n\nI constantly have people tell me they can barely hear my accent (I was raised in the USA and I live in Colorado, I don't have any accent, not even a regional American one.)  But the regional accent isn't the one they mean. I grew up in a community where the assumption was I would end up owning a laundry or restaurant, or be a neurosurgeon or engineer. Those were the stereotypes and expectations.\n\nThroughout the pandemic I had to worry about violence and vandalism of my car, because I am Asian and there were some attacks on Asians in my small city.\n\nPresumptions are made about who I might be and what work I might do based on race. The same is true of other races.\n\nRace matters because people make assumptions based on race. Black Americans are victims of deadly violence by the very people sworn to protect them. People have been murdered for driving under the influence of being black. People make assumptions that a young black man is always up to no good, they cross the street, they are afraid.\n\nRace matters because because 127,000 Japanese Americans were gathered up, displaced to prison camps in the desert, for the crime of being Japanese Americans. Their goods, businesses and houses were stolen and never returned to them. (This even happened, on the east coast, to some German Americans as well.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRace matters when any Karen can cast racial slurs at anyone they deem Hispanic, and feel entitled to demand \"their papers.\" Search \"Karen confronts Hispanic\" on Youtube if you want your eyes opened.\n\nAnd on a positive note, race and ethnicity matter because of the cultures and foods and religions all of us grew up in, whether someone is Black, Korean, Polish, British we carry the stories of our grandparents and their foods in our lives. Its a point of pride and celebration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI grew up in a city of neighborhoods, divided sharply by steep hills and mountains. There were enclaves of Polish only, Greek only, German, Jewish, Italian, Russian. A lot of us knew some of \"the mother tongue,\" most of us lived less then a mile from where our grandparents settled when they emigrated. All our great grandparents/grandparents only spoke their native language and their kids were bilingual and the grandkids could all speak some of the mother tongue. I grew up on that food as well as typical American food.",

You mention tolerating LGBT displays vs your anti-lgbtq display for instance. Why is it that once side seems to always want to display acceptance and love. While the other wants removing women's rights and anti-lgbtq displays.\n\nYou see where it's kinda fucked up? Like, one side wants displays about accepting people, the other about hating people.

Even *calling* it Pride comes down on a side of endorsement or celebration. But you can certainly do a display of books on the history and/or famous figures, or even on both sides of controversial topics (like having *Being Jazz* alongside *Irreversible Damage*). Then it's just relevant things the library already has that might be in demand this time of year. Just like you might see a holiday display in December, with some religious material, some cookbooks, some Santa stuff, some Kwanzaa. \n\nBut if you walk in and see a Pride display with a sign that says \"Love is love\", that's to me no different from walking in and seeing a Christmas display with a sign that says \"Your Savior is born!\" There's a difference and it's crazy that people can see the difference with every \"holiday\" except Pride.",

She got in trouble for the stuff she did on the clock, not for the stuff she did off the clock. In the article it makes it clear that the city is trying to prevent the librarians from exercising their free speech even when they're off the clock and THAT is unconstitutional.\n\n(Let's take a second to acknowledge that private companies are totally allowed to place such limits on their employees, as the 1st Amendment doesn't apply to them.

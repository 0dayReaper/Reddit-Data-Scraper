Here's a brief second hand rundown.\n\nChildren's books vary widely based on the target age. Generally you'll write a story or draft of the appropriate complexity then either contract an artist or do the art yourself. And iterate until you feel its ready. The topic can really be whatever you want, it just had to be written in an accessible way. \n\nSome people collaborate with their artists from the start so the book is a fusion of their visions. Much like comics, it helps to have sketches of the art you want or a detailed description. \n\nWhen it comes to publishing there are three  options. Self publishing, self publishing through a broker like amazon, and traditional publishing.\n\nSelf publishing yourself is expensive, but possible. Its a lot of work but you get to keep whatever you make. I have a friend that's done it. It shouldn't vary much between book types. You have to do all the editing, marketing, copyright etc yourself.\n\nSelf publishing through amazon means giving up your right to ever have it printed by anyone else along with most of the profit. But it is *relatively* easy.\n\nTraditional publishing is a competitive field, but I know a person who's done it, though not for a children's book. The publishers required a pitch from my friend. Basically she had to figure out similar books and sell the idea of her book. I'm not sure of the rest of the process. Presumably she has or will work with an editor. Idk what's required for a children's book by publishers but you can google it and check the websites of different publishers. \n\nThere are books you can read about this process and online guides. \n\nI'd avoid chatgpt and image generators. Unless you're just printing something for your own kid, there's unresolved legal issues. And personally I don't get the point of automating the writing and drawing. That's the only fun part of the process. You're basically just making yourself the unpaid publishing agent for a machine if you automate the creation. Bleh.",

I vividly remember being bullied as a kid for bringing foods like Vienna sausage, spam, adobo, sunny side up eggs and fried rice for lunch. Kids would call me \u201cpoor boy\u201d or tell me my food stinks or taunt me asking if the sausage was made of dog. I hated eating lunch at school and begged my parents and grandparents to get me lunchables to make it stop. One day I had enough and socked the bully when he threw my lunch on the floor saying my adobo looked like dog food. I hit him so hard I knocked his 2 front teeth out. My Mom, Grandma and Grandpa were not pleased to be picking me up from the Principals office that day. My grandpa sure was proud though and he told me to never feel ashamed of my heritage, my culture, but violence is never the answer. That was the last day I felt ashamed about being Filipino and the food I was bringing every day. it was also the last day I was bullied. This book will definitely help educate kids on different cultures and the different types of foods people eat and hopefully one less kid will be shamed and bullied for their heritage.",

I hated my lunches cause they were always so boring. So I would always ask to trade food with others so I could try their food. I was fascinated that they brought stuff that wasn't just a sandwich and a banana. And they always wanted my shitty food, so it worked out. One of my best friends in elementary school was Indian, the other was Vietnamese so I had good eating a lot of the time. Been a foodie my whole life and still trying new foods today. Best part about Houston is the food, you can find anything you want and there is always something new to try. We just recently had an explosion of African restaurants in my area and I can't wait to start trying them out!",

My aunt took me to a beauty shop for \"girl time\" and let them give me a perm. I already had thick coke bottle glasses and second hand clothes working for me. Horrible mess.\n\nFirst class was PE and I was ruthlessly teased.  It progressed over the next few weeks.  Not just name calling, boys would throw things at me to see if they would stick in my hair. Walk behind me and spit in my hair.  Not just individuals, whole groups would target and harass me. \n\nI cussed them out, but never got violent. I was always outnumbered. I asked admins for help but they said I was equally to blame for reacting so strongly and to \"just ignore them.\" \n\nSo I got a notebook. I documented each and every time I was bullied. I noted the time, place and witnesses (some of whom were teachers/coaches.) After a week I had 37 names in the notebook, including most of the starters on the Football Team. \n\nThis was in Texas. \n\nI made an appointment with the assistant principal.  He started with the spiel of how I needed to ignore them. \n\nI presented my notebook and informed him if actions weren't taken to stop this, I would go to the police and file assault charges on those that physically harassed me. Players would get benched if they were charged. He asked to keep the notebook. I advised him he could photocopy it. \n\nCoaches were called to the mat. Parents were called. I heard when they had a parent teacher conference about it they had to hold it in the cafeteria because there were so many people. \n\nThe bullying stopped and all the boys gave me a W I D E berth after that.  I went to a different highschool than most of them.  My hair grew out and I got contacts. And I learned going to the principals' office wasn't scary when I set the appointments.",

Some actually do care though, and do their job. Just doesn't fit the reddit narrative.\n\nMy brother-in-law is a school vice-principle, one of his primary responsibilities is managing discipline. He deals with plenty of bullies. He can't do anything about the behavior he doesn't know about. Stop promoting this idea that it's never worthwhile to talk to the adults.",

I've done a Japanese tamago gohan rice bowl for breakfast a few times, but it was always on a weekend later in the day when I've got the time and feeling hungrier. It was definitely more filling and tastier, but it also took a lot longer to make and eat.",

During the colonial period there were many Chinese immigrants from Fujian in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Today there are many foods in these three countries that are derived from the Hokkien language that is traditionally spoken by these Chinese people: lumpia, hopia/bakpia, piaya, pansit, mami, etc. These words are heard not only in these three countries, but also Taiwan since the vast majority of Taiwanese are also Hoklo. \n\nThere is a pretty large Chinese food influence on the Philippines, easily the largest foreign food influence in the country in fact. This is reinforced as well because most of the famous Filipino stars as well as the big businesses are at least half Chinese (\u201cmestizo\u201d in the Philippine context refers to Chinese-Filipinos; intermixing between Spaniards and Filipinos was very rare in fact. Spanish surnames in the Philippines come from a law passed in 1849 by the colonial government that forced Filipinos to adopt surnames, where traditionally they had none). You can usually tell if a food is Chinese in origin in the country by its more\u2026simplistic name? Indigenous foods almost always have Austronesian names and are longer and conjugated. This is because the languages spoken in the Philippines remain the indigenous Austronesian languages rather than any colonial language. Even adobo, with its Spanish name, is ultimately a type of paksiw, an indigenous food.",

Chu. It\u2019s an edited volume that discuses many different aspects of the Chinese diaspora in the Philippines, and actually most of the articles are authored by Chinese-Filipino scholars. I am not sure how available it is outside the Philippines though, to be honest. Maybe try finding\u2026unofficial avenues. \n\nIn general, contrary to what many people may think, the Philippines\u2019 biggest outside influences are India and China. Same as Indonesia and Malaysia, really. India is particularly influential in areas of spirituality, philosophy, and precolonial politics (we know this from the etymologies of particular important Filipino philosophical and spiritual concepts, as well as the titles of rulers), and China in the realm of food and media culture. The influences of Spain and the US are arguably more surface level and actually relate more to modern economics and politics rather than the culture. \n\nTraditional Filipino textiles and clothing is largely indigenous in background, though perhaps there is a relation between barongs and Indian clothing as well, not to mention the use of sarongs in the baro\u2019t saya outfit. The saya, or skirt, is actually a two piece made up of a sarong and a malong. Sarongs and malongs are found throughout SE Asia, notably in Indonesia and Cambodia. Baro simply means shirt in the Philippine languages, but today it has come to mean a particular fancy type of indigenous clothing.",

One of the worst in the world. The functional literacy rate in the Philippines is only around 19% (I wrote another piece in the Inquirer about this in fact). And aside from that the history curriculum is awful. With a bad history curriculum, interest and passion for culture is majorly diminished because there is no understanding of the country\u2019s background. It isn\u2019t a coincidence that most of the true cultural pride comes from students, and especially grad students, at UP or Ateneo: they are the schools with more accurate history curricula. The vast majority of people in the country though instead get to hear wrong narratives about how they were civilized by the Spanish and how amazing the Americans were. Absurd and it engenders a continued colonial mentality that is hurtful towards cultural pride.",

The truth is that I am fluent in Tagalog (I am not Filipino though) and study another Philippine language as well, in Tausug. I also have studied Chinese and some Malay. The beautiful thing about my language choices are the inferences that can be made from them in areas of food. \n\nBut people are not really sure, for example, if ginataang manok (Filipino curry chicken) originated in the Philippines or if it came from India or somewhere else. It\u2019s more watery though, despite possessing all the ingredients of a typical Indian curry. We also can observe that Cambodia has a dish called amok that is basically the same thing as ginataang manok. So clearly there is a pretty ancient curry-making tradition in SE Asia. We *do* know definitely that kari-kari comes from India though. Kari is a Tamil word and that\u2019s where we get the word curry in English in fact, as well as the kari-kari in the Philippines. Thailand also has a peanut curry dish\u2026\n\nI actually recently wrote an article for the Philippine Daily Inquirer about some Filipino food comparisons (the Inquirer is the best English-language news source in the Philippines; think of it like PH\u2019s Japan Times).

Bay leaves and curry leaves are interchangeable.\n\nAs long as the meat isn't too lean, like rabbit (DO NOT DARE MAKING ADOBO OUT OF THIS.

The non asian kid found him weird. It's normal in asia to eat normal lunch meal in school. And then domic also find them weird eating lunchables at lunch. Also adobo is freaking easy to make. If I'm too lazy or busy to cook, adobo is a good solution.",

Admittedly they aren't doing a good enough job but endorsing violence is a worse solution then demanding schools do their jobs properly. \n\nWhen we teach our children to solve their people problems with violence then we end up with a generation of children that see all people problems as nails needing a hammer.",

As we get older, our elected officials who are supposed to represent us let us down for their own selfish interests. And our final step of Unionization is slowly being made illegal.\n\nThese were the civilized alternatives to more drastic, unkind methods that also got results. THIS was our social contract - no more violent actions as long as we're heard and our requests honored through these alternatives.\n\nBut the threat of violence was always there and deeply implied - do not mistake our civility for weakness. Renege on this deal at your own risk, literally. \n\nHowever, over the years, we were told gentle lies from well-intentioned people that protests and civil action to correct grievances must *always* be non-violent. And as such, they demonized anyone who used violence or even took strong action. \n\nNow, look at today's America. It's been decided by our high courts that Unions which cause financial harm through striking have to pay restitution fees. Tell that to coal miners of yesteryear who carried pitchforks and torches. They'd be utterly ashamed of how we squandered what they fought so hard to get.\n\nSo when those in charge realized there was no more threat, what do they have to be afraid of?  We'll what, wag our finger at them and say they're mean fuddy-duddies? Chant rhyming couplets while taking a leisurely stroll down the street? They're trembling on their yachts. **They'll ignore us with zero consequence.**",

It also escalates and usually results in groups/clusters of violence/violence outside school. So they do not normally \u201cfuck right off\u201d they escalate and it gets a lot more serious. I agree with the grandpa here. People who get violent usually feel threatened and feel like the victim, and use your exact \u201creasoning\u201d to act on the violence.\n\nI am a bit surprised to see a call for violence upvoted in a book sub, but that is my own bias.",

    "postText": "This isn't meant to be a detailed analysis and review, so I'm not going to touch on the themes or more specific aspects of the story. I just wanted to throw some thoughts on here after finishing the book a couple of days ago.\n\nI enjoyed this book after a few false starts when I got it last year. I got the book a long while back, and I'd begin it, and put it down, again and again. The first few chapters weren't bad, but they didn't hook me, and I'd end up reading something else as a result.\n\nBut, then I picked up Hendrix's newer novel \"How To Sell A Haunted House\" and really enjoyed it. I noticed a couple of pacing issues in that book, but enjoyed it so much, I decided to buckle down and finish Book Club.\n\nHaunted House gave me a better feel for Hendrix's writing, who first came on my radar because of his book Paperbacks From Hell. Once I got a sense of his tone and style, it was a lot easier to get sucked into Book Club.\n\nBut now that I've read two of his novels, I think the trend between them is definitely a problem with third acts, and I was curious if anyone else felt the same way, or if this was unique to these two books in his catalog.\n\nThe central parts of the books and the rising action both get really intense and exciting, and he dumps a ton of new concepts at you and hints at larger plot points and more story to tell, then it's like he got a phone call in the middle of a discussion and he quickly \"wraps things up\" with \"and then they have a big fight, win, and it's all resolved, the end!\" And he runs off to talk to his aunt or whatever.\n\nIn Haunted House he suddenly throws all these other puppets and dolls into the battle, and he never explains how they gained sentience, and he doesn't touch on the other paranormal elements he introduced.\n\nAnd in Book Club, he quickly adds in that Slick is going to possibly turn into a vampire, a possible vampire association, and only briefly touches on his central characters lives in an epilogue fashion.\n\nI can see what he may be going for here- leaving the reader wanting more, introducing an element of mystery to his stories, chilling implications....\n\nBut I think he doesn't do a great job of having that effect. He certainly does make me wish there was more, but not in a \"Oh no, what a terrifying thread left hanging!\" And more in a \"This feels like it was setting up for a sequel that won't ever come\" way.\n\nI think this is magnified by the fact that his endings feel truncated, so we're so suddenly thrown into the final confrontation, that I end up lingering on those under developed aspects even more. I end up feeling like, if the third act had had more time to breathe, then maybe there'd have been more satisfaction for those elements.\n\nAs for the frustration I mentioned in the title- Book Club has some pretty realistic depictions of middle class suburbia, at least from my country bumpkin perspective. I found myself disliking everyone in the novel except Ms. Greene. I sympathized with the main character, and I found myself infuriated with how she was treated.... And then the time skip happens and she's in lock step with everyone! Ahhh! Haha, it was a great example of how easily people can be pressured into conformity and a lack of empathy for people outside their circles, but man, that entire section of the book raised my blood pressure!\n\nI know Hendrix is in the HorrorLit subreddit, not sure if he browses here, so I'll just crosspost it there, so if you end up reading this- keep up the good work! I know I had some criticisms, but I still enjoy your books a lot.\n\nAnyone else have similar feelings, disagree?",

            "comment": "I think you nailed my exact frustrations with his books. What I think happens is that Hendrix sort of paints himself into a corner and doesn't know how to write out of it. For example in Southern Book Club, &gt;!I was completely baffled when the main character has a mental breakdown because while she's definitely in distress, it didn't seem like she was that close to completely losing it at that point in the story, but later on in the story when truly disturbing stuff happens, she is okay.!&lt;  I think I came to appreciate that even with these issues, at least he's keeping the story moving along rather than getting bogged down and making the story feel boring.\n\nAll this being said, I sort of became obsessed with his (fictional) books and have read all of them (I think) within a few weeks. They all kind of have this flaw some worse than others. I am not a professional reviewer, but the quality of writing is pretty similar to the books you mentioned in your post. They're kind of tropey, but I'm reading for fun, so I generally enjoyed all of them. \n\nI told my wife that he writes a good 3.5 stars book. A little better than average, but always has some flaws to the story.",

                    "comment": "Yeah, I was on the fence about the situation you mentioned. I thought it felt abrupt too, but I tried to rationalize it as her coping with the underlying trauma and stress happening in her life, rather than the overt supernatural elements.\n\nThere's two stories sort of happening here- a supernatural horror story with a vampire terrorizing a small town. And then there's a drama about a woman who's being mistreated by her husband and doesn't know how to connect with her children as they mature, and one of them is obviously sort of paralleling a sort of alt-right radicalization process, while the other she feels threatened by, in some ways, because she feels herself aging when she looks at her daughter.\n\nI think that her breakdown is more to do with that latter elements than the overt story happening, but I think it still feels abrupt.\n\nAnd the time skip that happened afterwards genuinely enraged me, but not because it was bad, but because it was so realistic, haha.",

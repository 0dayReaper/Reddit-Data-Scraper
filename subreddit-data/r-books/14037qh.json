    "postText": "A coworker of mine recommended Perdido Street Station recently, and as the name China Mieville had come up related to other books and authors I've read and I was looking for something new, I thought I'd give it a try.\n\nIn this post, I'm going to try to organize my thoughts about why I hate this book and why it is objectively bad. Not in my opinion, not according to my tastes or preferences. Objectively bad. In the same way as the Holocaust was an objective tragedy.\n\n1. Nonsensical world-building. China Mieville is often credited for building a believable, immersive, vivid or other such positively described world. I didn't believe that Bas Lag was, or could be, a \"real\" place for a second.\n   1. Let's start with the main races. We have humans, bug-headed people, flying bird-headed people, cactus people, and frog people. All of these seem to fall into the Star Trek alien trope, where the body is basically humanoid, and only the head is different. This is not believable. Further, I never really got a sense that their cultures were so different. The bird people only got developed near the end of the book, and that was just enough to explain Yag's crime to the readers. One interaction with a group of city-dwelling bird people seems transposed from a British crime movie where the gang leader is reasserting authority of the group, in exactly the same way as a human would. I don't get any sense that they are a fully developed species with their own cultures and ways of thinking. Lin, a member of the bug-headed people, comes of as a typical female human character, despite coming from a species that seems to have collectivism built in to their society and their genes. The cactus people are never really explained at all. Like, do they use photosynthesis? Do they eat food? What's their culture? I just kept imagining people walking around cosplaying these different races but all being essentially humans.\n   2. Word and concept choice. At one point, Mieville has a character use the word \"capiche.\" Mind you, Italy does not exist in this world, nor does the Mafia, nor should an Italian American gangster word like \"capiche.\" Similarly, he never says anything about God, Christianity, Judaism, etc, but he borrows the concept of \"Hell\" and \"Hellkin.\" If there is a hell, there should be a heaven, right? And if heaven and hell exist, there's a god, right? These are simply thrown out there, and never elaborated on again. For money, he uses real world currency names, such as mark, shekel, and Guinea. These have no place in an imaginary world with no connection to our own.\n\n   Isaac is a scientist, and while I don't think it is important to get science \"right\" in a work that is fictional and that is specifically NOT science fiction, the scientific concepts explained here don't make sense. It reminded me more of the characters in Frank Herbert's Destination: Void talking about transistors, circuits, blah-blah matrices, and yadda-yadda amplifiers. The blah-blah matrices and yadda-yadda amplifiers don't exist, and spending so much time on them didn't make any sense in a novel with so little action. Neither does the number of pages that Mieville devotes to explaining unified field theory add to my understanding or enjoyment of the novel. Nothing in the novel really hinges on this, and the fact that Torque seems to throw a wrench in this idea of having a unified field at all makes me more annoyed at spending time trying to understand what Isaac is getting on about. The idea of \"crisis\" and a \"crisis engine\" in particular seems like a scientifically illiterate person's interpretation of chaos and complexity theory.\n\n   3. \"History.\" The way the \"history\" is presented here feels very much like it needs those scare quotes. Are these places and events actually relevant to the story? How much thought was put into them and their order? The way that so many are mentioned and then just forgotten really makes me wonder how seriously I should take them.\n\n2.Poor word choices and sentence construction.\n\n   1. I've never read a book that made me want to take a shower before. When Mieville describes the city of New Crobuzon, he relies heavily on words with negative emotional valance and bodily fluid language. As a small set of examples, the air is almost always described as having a stench, reeking, being rank, putrid, noisome, being polluted, etc. Water is usually described as being fecal, mucal, fetid, rancid, oily, being polluted, etc. Buildings are moldy, desquamating, dirty. Factories don't emit or release smoke: they \"retch\" smog. Guns don't fire bullets or shoot bullets: they \"vomit\" bullets. A sack that is full is described as \"bloated.\" A pile of electrical components is for some reason described as \"vile.\" For 712 fucking pages! I don't have a problem with bodily fluids, and I don't mind when other writers describe a slum or paint a picture of a nasty scene. But in Perdido Street Station, there is no let up. I can't remember a single instance of something that was described in positive terms. Even the first time Isaac has sex with Lin, he is described as almost vomiting because her antennae were waving in such a disgusting fashion. And they went on to have a long term romance! Who almost vomits the first time they have sex with someone they love? Why describe it in this negative way? I don't understand the goal of using language in this way.\n   2. Related to the point above, the book is monotonous in how it describes the world. Everything is negative and dirty. For 712 pages.\n   3. Characterization is done in the typical spoon-fed fashion that seems to be popular in many genres of fiction nowadays. I'm thinking of one example in particular, so here it is.\n\n&gt;\"Lin and Isaac snatched furtive nights together when they could. Isaac could tell that all was not well with her. Once, he sat her down and demanded that she tell him what was troubling her, why she had not entered the Shintacost Prize this year (something which had given her usual bitchery about the standard of the shortlist an added bitterness), what she was working on, and where. There was no sign of any artistic debris at all in any of her rooms. Lin had stroked his arm, clearly grateful for his concern. But she would tell him nothing. She said she was working on a piece of which she was tentatively very proud. She had found a space that she could not and did not want to talk about, in which she was producing a large piece that he mustn\u2019t ask her about. It was not as if she had disappeared from the world. Once a fortnight, perhaps, she was back in one of the Salacus Fields bars, laughing with her friends, if with a little less vigour than she had two months ago.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She teased Isaac about his anger at Lucky Gazid, who had vanished, with suspiciously good timing. Isaac had told Lin about his inadvertent sampling of dreamshit, and had raged around looking to punish Gazid. Isaac had described the extraordinary grub which seemed to thrive on the drug. Lin had not seen the creature, had not been back to Brock Marsh since that forlorn day the previous month, but even allowing for a degree of exaggeration on Isaac\u2019s part, the creature sounded extraordinary. Lin thought fondly of Isaac as she adeptly changed the subject. She asked him what nourishment he thought the caterpillar might gain from its peculiar food, and sat back as his face expanded with fascination and he would tell her enthusiastically that he did not know, but that these were a few of his ideas. She would ask him to try to explain to her about crisis energy, and whether he thought it would help Yagharek to fly, and he would talk animatedly, drawing her diagrams on slips of paper.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was easy to work on him. Lin felt, sometimes, that Isaac knew he was being manipulated, that he felt guilty about the ease with which his worries for her were transformed. She sensed gratitude in his lurching changes of subject, along with contrition. He knew it was his role to be worried for her, given her melancholy, and he was, he truly was, but it was an effort, a duty, when most of his mind was crammed with crisis and grub food. She gave him permission not to worry, and he accepted it with thanks. Lin wanted to displace Isaac\u2019s concerns for her, for a time. She could not afford for him to be curious. The more he knew, the more she was in danger. She did not know what powers her employer might possess: she doubted he was capable of telepathy, but she was risking nothing. She wanted to finish her piece, to take the money and to get away from Bonetown.\"\n\n   Let me remind you, this book is 712 pages long. He takes approximately two pages,    from 208-209 in the Kindle edition, to detail all this information about the    relationship between Isaac and Lin. This is just bad writing. Some of this could have    been handled in short dialogues embedded in other scenes, and some of it should be left to the reader to piece together. This is an example of what Steven Erikson described as pablum in his post a few years ago about effective characterization. \n\n   4. Overly descriptive language. \n\n&gt;The great cable slipped in spurts into the water by the riverwall. It plunged absolutely precipitately into the darkness, hitting the surface at 90 degrees.\"\n\n(Perdido Street Station, p. 603)\n\nWhy, the fuck, does he describe the cable going into the water in such a redundant and repetitive way? This is not some pivotal event in the story. It is related to an important plan, but there is no need for the drama around this singular event. If I spent this many words talking about a character picking up a pencil, I had better have a real good reason for doing so. Mieville does this all the time. The above mentioned meetings with the Hellkin are another prime example. He spends pages describing the procedures for meeting them and the actual meeting, they add nothing to the story, AND they make his world seem poorly thought out. What did he gain by describing them? Hell if I know!\n\n3. Plot Structure and Pacing\n\n1. Stupid plot events. Mieville goes out of his way to show that the evil soul-eating moths are not damaged very much by regular physical attacks. And then, the first moth is killed by unceremoniously dropping a heavy weight on it, like something out of a Wile E. Coyote skit. Three of the remaining moths are killed using more appropriate means, but... Look, I know there were the infamous Milner experiments on rats where they'd press a button to get something like an orgasm, and once they could do this, they'd basically just press the button until they died. I don't know of any actual living organisms that will, for example, eat food so much that they physically explode, ignoring Monty Python sketches to the contrary. It's funny, but it doesn't seem like a realistic way to take out soul-eating creatures. \n\nAnother example is Jack Half-a-Prayer. He is mentioned maybe twice in the book, very obliquely, before suddenly near the climax he shows up and just starts helping the main characters out in the middle of a fire fight. If he had been foreshadowed more, if there were some stronger motivation than just \"Oh my main characters are in a pinch! I know! I'll have so-and-so come!\" I might have accepted this, but not the way it is done in the book. \n\n2. Pacing. This book overstays its welcome. Mieville creates too many new ideas and just throws them out without exploring their implications, and moves on to the next, and the next, and the next. (Sinistrals and Dextrals, I'm looking at you! Does anyone even remember this from the book?) Then he spends 10 pages describing the fucking Hellkin, or 20 pages revealing that one of characters was a government spy. Or the passage above where he tries to do a novelized version of a relationship montage to show the development of Lin and Isaac's relationship over time. It is too scattered and too focused on the stupidest things at the same time. Why do we need a multi-page graphically detailed moth orgy? In a 712 page book that already has too many adjectives and adverbs? By the 300 page mark, I was regularly having to psych myself into going on to the next page.\n\n4. Forgiveness. \n\nOne of my favorite fantasy series of all-time, The Malazan Book of the Fallen, takes empathy, compassion, and forgiveness as some of the major themes. I was at first shocked by how often the \"evil villain\" turned out to be someone with a tortured youth, tragic past, or some other circumstance that explained their behavior. And at the end of many of these tales, that dastardly sinner was taken off to be reformed, or taken under someone's wing to try and make up for the harm they'd caused. Yes, sometimes they were killed or maimed in gruesome fashion, but many had a chance to reform.\n\nIn contrast, in Perdido Street Station, it is revealed that Yagharek committed a serious crime among his people, for which he had his wings cut off without anesthesia. Isaac agrees to help him become able to fly anyway, and along the way we see Yagharek risk his life many times to protect this city that disgusts him (as evidenced by the large increase in those bodily fluid words during the Yagharek sections proceeding each part) and to protect his friends. Now, if we could get inside Yagharek's head during these moments, and see that he's thinking \"Oh, this had so better be worth it! I really don't give a fuck about these people and I just wanna fly again.\" That would be one thing. Near the end, it is revealed that Yagharek basically committed the crime of rape (which is framed as second degree choice theft, choice theft being an interesting sounding cultural concept, but which actually makes no sense if you try to work out the implications of how a legal system based on it would work....). Isaac is asked not to build the promised wings for Yagharek, and he ends up abandoning him.\n\nNow, look, I'm not condoning rape. I think it is a horrendous crime. As bad or worse than murder. People do horrible things. Sometimes with intention, sometimes in the heat of the moment. Of course, getting caught in the heat of the moment doesn't excuse the action. One of the problems is that Mieville doesn't reveal much about Yagharek's psychological state afterwards. We don't know, for example, if like Red's character in The Shawshank Redemption, he feels sorry for what he did as a hot-headed, stupid young man, and that every day he regrets what he did. I think a lot hinges on that. If Yagharek is really just looking for a way to void his punishment, Isaac is probably right to refuse him. If Yagharek regrets what he did, and wants to make up for it somehow, and needs something that will make his life worth continuing, Isaac probably should have helped him instead of being a closed-minded judgmental prick.\n\nGiven Yagharek's actions throughout the book, Isaac comes off as an asshole, and to the extent that his judgment matches Mieville's, so does Mieville.\n\n5. \"Political\" Themes\nI see a lot of discussion about how Mieville is very political and how he's a communist / socialist, and wants to take down capitalism, etc, etc. I picked up on a lot of that in PSS, but I think Mieville handles these themes very poorly. As a better example of a deconstruction / take-down of capitalism, I'd again recommend The Malazan Book of the Fallen, specifically Midnight Tides and Reaper's Gale, both of which examine the problem in more creative and deeper ways than Mieville does in PSS. \n\nSo that's my hot take on Perdido Street Station. You're free to disagree, but I'm tired of hearing so many demonstrably untrue claims made about the quality of Mieville's writing, in particular his descriptions and his world building as seen in PSS. I know that PSS was his second book, and he might have matured a lot as a writer since then (the same coworker who recommended him said his style doesn't change much in later books, but I can't judge them myself). But 712 pages is more than enough in one lifetime for me.",

            "comment": "Conversely, *Perdido Street Station* is an excellent book.  \n\nMost of the races (not all) are drawn from human mythology.  The bug-headed people are drawn from Egyptian mythology:\n\n&gt;Khepri (Egyptian: \u1e2bprj, also transliterated Khepera, Kheper, Khepra, Chepri) is a scarab-faced god in ancient Egyptian religion who represents the rising or morning sun.\n\nHe does this a *lot* through the book, and then tries to make a way to blend it together in a way that makes at least some sense rather than having it be entirely mythological.\n\nSure, the cactus people are never explained, but it's easy to draw a parallel between them and dryads and other mythological plant and tree beings.  It also draws upon Native American myths, such as that of Pasancana and Quehualliu, where people were either turned into cactus, or where certain species of cactus were considered to be honored relatives.  \n\nHis mix of races and such makes as much (or as little) sense as the mix in nearly any fantasy novel featuring multiple races, in fact more than many if you understand the mythological underpinnings.  He's not even subtle about it, he outright names many of the races directly after their real-world mythological inspirations.\n\nSo what if he never mentions 'God' but mentions Hell?  The word 'hell', and the concept of it is not a Christian thing, it's mythology they adopted from other cultures.  Hell specifically comes from pre-Christian Nordic mythology with Hel being the name of one of the goddesses, and nearly every culture has a tradition of some sort of underworld populated by dangerous and powerful creatures that interact with you after death.\n\nHere he is being consistent in his use of a range of different mythologies as the source of inspiration for the world building.\n\nYes, he uses 'capiche', he also has the characters speaking English, which also presumably doesn't actually exist in that world as there were no British, no Celts, no Germanic people, no Latin to draw upon, etc.  Quite literally *every* book that includes alien or fantasy, or far future, or distant past people does this in order for the reader to understand the story.  Specific words, like 'capiche', are chosen because you know what the context and implications of that are and he is using your understanding of that to let you understand the relationships in the story.  This is exactly what interpreters do and what differentiates them from translators here in the real world.\n\nHis word choice in describing New Crobuzon made you uncomfortable?  Well, *good*, that means he accomplished what he was intending, and did it very well.  The word choice is specifically meant to get the point across that the city is a filthy, dangerous, unpleasant, place where morality is rare and people only stay because in the midst of this filth and depravity there is massive opportunity as well, or they stay because they are desperate and have no other options, or because they have the wealth and power to be insulated from it.\n\nHis use of words and descriptions is extremely good and effective, as is directly evidenced by your reaction to it.  \n\nWe can literally go through your points one by one and make counters to them all, with the exception of his love of repetition of certain words and the deus-ex-machina aspect of Jack Half-a-Prayer.\n\nWe can get that you don't like it, that's absolutely fine and valid, but a good bit of your criticism seems to derive from perhaps not having a background that lets you see what he was doing and where many of the inspirations come from.\n\nOn the opinion side.... you found *The Malazan Book of the Fallen* to be more political, creative, and 'deeper' than PSS?!  I could not possibly disagree with you more as I found the *Malazan* series to be an excruciatingly badly written mess of stream-of-consciousness and obvious retconning desperately in need of a harsh editor that would have cut 3/4 of each book out and forced Erickson to focus a bit.  Personally I'll take PSS over Malazan any day, and my main complaint with the Bas Lag world is that there are only 3 books set in it, and that Mi\u00e9ville's writing got less and less creative over time.\n\nAgain, opinions vary.",

                    "comment": "You're fine having your own opinions about Malazan, but I do question your points about Mieville's use of language.\n\nI will grant you that he wrote in English - if he wrote the book in a completely fictional language that nobody in our world could read or understand, I know I would say the world would be a better place, for sure. Using the world Hell is not the same thing, though. Yes, your history of the term is correct, but it is still a concept that is tied to specific baggage in our world and I don't think using it is justified in his world without explaining more about the logic of his. Even in Norse mythology, as you point out, Hel was one of Loki's progeny, and is therefore tied to Norse gods and goddess, which are not mentioned at all or implied to exist in Bas Lag. Why not use \"underworld\" or \"afterlife\" or something else? If he's so creative, why not make up his own concept? The Weavers, I thought, were a cool idea and I would have liked to see original ideas explored and used more. The Handlings were another example. \n\nRegarding capiche...really? So if you were reading a story set in a fictional world and they suddenly mentioned the Spanish Inquisition you wouldn't bat an eye? Using Italian mobster slang is not just shorthand - it's lazy and it breaks immersion. If characters started using phrases like \"je ne sais quoi\" or \"dummkopf\" I'd say my criticism would still be valid.\n\nI take your point about being made uncomfortable as the goal of his language, but I think you slightly misunderstood my point. The larger point is this goes on for 712 pages. As an artist, if I wanted to produce some shocking effect, I need to be careful about overusing it, otherwise it gets repetitive and dull. I would say that's exactly what Mieville did. I was really interested in Yagharek's first entrance to the city, how grimy and disgusting everything was. After 100 pages in, I just started saying to myself, \"Yeah, we get it already. This is a nasty place. Move on. You're being that boring person at the party who just won't shut up about being the wen on their own arse of New Weird.\"",

There is no rule that says that if you borrow one aspect of a mythology you have to borrow all aspects.\n\nIn addition, going back to the language issue, it\u2019s a term the reader will understand. It has connotations and impact that something like \u2018underworld\u2019 lacks, and on the creativity side of things \u2018underworld\u2019 is about as uncreative as it\u2019s possible to be.\n\nThe Spanish Inquisition example doesn\u2019t make any sense as a criticism as that\u2019s a specific *event*, like the burning of the Hindenburg.

Those writers are also being lazy and unoriginal, which is one of the reasons why I enjoyed many of the races in Malazan Book of the Fallen: there're no elves, dwarfs, or goblins around; I think the only one he borrows is dragons...\n\nThe last thing I'll say about Hell is this: why does he borrow this at all? What does it contribute to the story or the world he is building? I made this same point in my write up, but he spends a good number of pages describing the rituals for accessing the Ambassador, detailing the meeting, and even the pointless speculation about which sound is the Ambassador's real voice: the smooth one or the delayed in-agony echo. Couldn't he have simply left this out? Wouldn't we have a tighter, more cohesive narrative, with less \"bloat,\" to use one of his favorite words? If he really wanted something unique there, as I said before, then he could have used his imagination and made up some more original stuff. Again, I point to the Weavers and the Handlings as two prime examples. The original ideas he does create are underutilized.\n\nNight!",

I'd agree with the philosopher Karl Popper and many others, and acknowledge that we will probably never know \"objective\" reality with 100% accuracy and certainty. \n\nI have, however, given clear reasons, and supports and examples for those reasons. The rebuttals to my points thus far seem to be:\n\n1. **\"Yeah, well, that's just like, your opinion, man.\"** This is not a coherent argument and does nothing to establish that my supports and examples are wrong, incorrect, fabricated, misconstrued, or don't reflect things that Mieville actually wrote in Perdido Street Station.\n2. (Regarding his use of \"capiche,\" Hell and Hellkin, and borrowing races wholecloth from our world.) **\"But lots of other fantasy authors do it, why can't he?\"** These other fantasy authors are, by and large, followers of Tolkien, *who Mieville himself calls the \"wen on the arse of fantasy.\"* If you want to hold Mieville to the same low standard as you apply to those authors, go ahead. I'm sure he won't thank you for it.\n3. (Regarding his too frequent use of negatively charged words and bodily fluid language) **\"You're just too sheltered and used to fantasy that makes you comfortable to handle a little discomfort.\"** OR **\"You are clearly not well-read enough to appreciate what he did.\"** These are ad hominem attacks and they don't address my points. OR **\"He choose those words to create atmosphere, dummy.\"** Everyone who reads critically knows that authors choose their words extremely carefully in order to create the precise effect they want for their readers. There is a difference between creating atmosphere and trying to use arcane magic to turn the atmosphere **turgid**, slide **rancid** lube all over its **ribbed** surface, and bash the reader over the head with it. [Look, here's an interview where Mieville himself responds to this criticism.](https://crookedtimber.org/2005/01/11/with-one-bound-we-are-free-pulp-fantasy-and-revolution/#more-2740) My criticism goes beyond the points that are mentioned, however, as he extends this use of words to guns, cloth sacks, and machines in factories (which according to him, \"rut.\"). As I've said in my other responses - he had me *hooked* the first time Yagharek entered the city. It was dark and gritty and horrible, and I couldn't stop reading. By the 1000th time he describes the water as foul, I'm just annoyed and bored.",

Not in my opinion, not according to my tastes or preferences. Objectively bad. In the same way as the Holocaust was an objective tragedy.\n\nIn which case, telling you that what you wrote is an opinion is not a nonsensical argument because I don't think you're wrong to think as you do about the quality of *Perdido Street Station*, but all you've done is present opinion after opinion. And you've done nothing to prove that it's \"objectively bad\" because you'd first have to define \"objectively bad\", which is going to have you falling into the same pitfalls you are now. And the burden of proof is not on me, but on you to prove that you are being purely objective and are demonstrating that *Perdido Street Station* is factually a bad book, which you can't do probably period, but definitely not by offering personal anecdotes and irritations. We're not even close to worrying about objective reality here, we're just talking about literature and tastes, which is incredibly subjective by its nature.\n\nThis is literally all just like, your opinion, man, and that's totally fine. Just don't expect people to accept that your opinions are capital-T true because you had them and used lots of words to describe them.",

I can see why others consider this their favorite story of all time, but the opaque motives of the characters and the florid prose just don\u2019t do it for me.\n\nI have similar problems with Hyperion by Dan Simmons and most of Alistair Reynold\u2019s books.",

I freely acknowledge that we all have different tastes and preferences, especially when it comes to fiction, music, and games. You're free to continue liking or disliking Mieville, as you please. Capiche?\n\nJust don't tell me that my points about his language use and world-building are unfounded (you can still like them!!! just don't tell me the issue has no basis in the actual written words in PSS) And please stop with the \"you're not \"hip\" enough, \"well-read\" enough or \"cultured\" enough to get what he's trying to do.\" Clearly, I've suffered from a case of Mieville-derangement syndrome, and I've been overstating my claims about my objectivity. On the other hand, in responding to people's comments, with one exception (my apologies u/InvisibleSpaceVamp for the snide comment about English grammar), I don't think that I've called into question anyone's intelligence, reading background, culturedness, or hipness.\n\nSo, there it is. I'm done talking about China Mieville. Y'all can go back to your regularly scheduled lives.",

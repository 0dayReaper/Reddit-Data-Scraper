    "postText": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m James Islington and *The Will of the Many*, the first book in my new series *Hierarchy*, has just been released. It\u2019s a heavily Roman-inspired epic fantasy mixed with dark academia, and follows an overthrown prince as he hides from the empire which killed his family. I\u2019ve seen it described as *Red Rising* meets *The Name of the Wind*, and I think that\u2019s a great high-level description of it (particularly as those are both influences and personal favourites of mine). Here\u2019s [the Goodreads link]( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58416952-the-will-of-the-many) for those who want to check out some reviews.\n\nAs far as my previous works go: my first book, *The Shadow of What Was Lost*, started out self-published in 2014 before selling far beyond my wildest expectations, then being picked up for audio and traditional publication along with the rest of Licanius. I completed that trilogy in late 2019. The series has sold more than a million copies to date across all formats.\n\nI\u2019m admittedly not often on social media but if you want to stay up to date with me, you can find me on [Twitter]( https://twitter.com/IslingtonJames), [Facebook]( https://www.facebook.com/p/James-Islington-100063640753309) or [my website]( https://jamesislington.com) (where I give quarterly updates on my writing progress). Right now, though, if you have any questions for me \u2013 regarding Hierarchy, Licanius, the self-pub vs trad experience, writing in general, other stuff I\u2019m into, whatever \u2013 then fire away. Ask me anything!\n\nEDIT: Alright, I'm done for the day! I have a chaotic weekend coming up, but I'll check back Monday morning my time for any stragglers. Thanks so much to everyone who joined in - it's been fun!\n\nEDIT 2: Done! I think I got to everyone, really sorry if there was anyone I missed. Thanks again, see you next time!",

                    "comment": "Hey! Inspiration for Licanius is hard to pin down because writing an epic fantasy series was something I\u2019d wanted to do since I was a teenager, so I had a whole bunch of ideas that built up over the course of more than a decade before I sat down to write. But mainly, I think it was a dissatisfaction with how prophecies were generally portrayed in fantasy (at least the ones that I\u2019d read to that point). It always felt like it was a bit of a cheat when there were just these vaguely worded, symbol-heavy statements about what was going to happen \u2013 I think because they\u2019re so open to interpretation, I found it hard to give them any real weight. So in a lot of ways, among other things, Licanius was my attempt to address that perceived issue.\n\nThe Will of the Many came about largely because I wanted to move on to something new after working on Licanius for so long \u2013 I really set out to create a world and a story that had a different feel and different themes to what I\u2019d done before. I had some vague ideas about the magic system already, and knew the themes I was interested in exploring\u2026 and then after I made the decision to use ancient Rome as an influence, I got a lot of inspiration from learning more about that time period, too.\n\nAnd signed special editions \u2013 yes! In the works!",

And if there was an adaption of my work, even understanding that it\u2019s a very different medium, I\u2019d want *some* level of input into how it was done too\u2026 so without sitting down and discussing specifics with them, it\u2019s actually really difficult to say who\u2019d be a good choice!\n\nBut to give a hopefully more satisfying answer - a dream collaboration would be to work with the team who made Arcane (who I believe are owned by Riot now so sadly I think they\u2019re entirely spoken for, but still\u2026) \u2013 I was such a big fan of that show. Beautiful animation and they actually seemed to care about the plot and character arcs. I genuinely haven\u2019t enjoyed a fantasy show that much in a long time. And while I know the reach of animation isn\u2019t the same as live action, I honestly think it\u2019s a better format for fantasy. It\u2019s *so* hard, and so heavy on the budget, to make fantasy look good on the screen! So, yeah. That\u2019d be my dream choice.\n\nAnd thank you!",

Look, in some ways it was actually good: it meant that I had to focus on what was important in the story, and I do think what I had to cut in the third Licanius book ultimately improved the flow of it without taking away too much. But it's definitely something I was annoyed at myself for, especially while writing The Light of All That Falls - because no matter the plan, it really is just an unnecessarily restrictive thing to have in your title. So 100%, I would go back and change it.\n\nFor Hierarchy... three? Probably? Maybe? I very much know where I'm going, but I've given myself some pretty good flexibility not just with the series name, but with how I've structured my outline. I probably won\u2019t know for sure until I\u2019ve written the first draft of book 3. But if the series does stretch to four, I wouldn\u2019t be shocked at all.",

My second time through I was amazed at how much foreshadowing I had missed that became quite obvious and how much more 'together' the book was than I originally thought (eg you seemed to have a very good idea of the whole trilogy even at that point).\n\nAfter reading  TWOTM (which I really enjoyed) I feel like it might not quite have the same level of foreshadowing (although hard to tell without knowing the rest of the series).  There's certainly a lot of unanswered questions.\n\nI personally felt like TWOTM's pacing was a bit off and things felt quite rushed near the end. Examples:\n\n* I totally missed why Vis decided to take the opportunity to run the labyrinth at that particular time.\n* The Alupi scenes felt a tad off too, but maybe there's more to that animal than I was led to believe\n\nComparing TWOTM and TSOWWL which book are you happier with?\n\nYou went with a first person view from Vis in this book, was that an experiment? are you intended to continue this through the whole series?",

But much like Licanius, it may not become clear until the series is done.\n\nTo quickly address your examples, if it helps:\n\n&gt;!- The timing of the Labyrinth run was a necessity, based on both Ulciscor\u2019s threat and the inaccessible location of the Labyrinth itself. It was very much Vis' only opportunity to run it.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!- The alupi scenes will have further significance moving forward.!&lt;\n\nI am actually much, much happier with this book than Shadow. I\u2019m very proud of Shadow, obviously, but it\u2019s my first work and there were so many lessons from writing that whole series that I've now been able to apply to this one. I\u2019m fairly confident in saying that this book is objectively better \u2013 not to say that everyone will automatically *enjoy* it more, because that\u2019s always going to come down to individual taste, but it's definitely better *crafted* (as it should be, with eight years more experience under my belt!). \n\nThe switch to first person was because I really wanted to write something that felt different to Licanius \u2013 both for myself and readers - and changing perspective just felt like a good starting point. But I\u2019ve really enjoyed writing that style. I\u2019ll be sticking with it for this series, for sure.",

As soon as I saw we were following Caeden, my body literally flooded with goosebumps as I predicted this is the only way this story can end!! All I can say is that thank God I was not reading this at night otherwise I would have been awake for hours, such was the rush of energy I got out of that conclusion - so thank you for that!\n\nQuestion: &gt;!I really enjoyed the menace of the Darklands, do you view it as somewhere physically accessible or more metaphysical/only accessible through magic? As there was no essence there I assume this place simply existed elsewhere?  I was endlessly curious when I read that beings from the Darklands aren't just powerful, but have access to 'knoweldge'. !&lt;\n\nAlso, really enjoyed the dark power and mystery of Shammaeloth, although entirely his own villain, do you think there was any inspiration between him and The Cthaeh in The Kingkiller Chronicle? I was always fascinated with the idea of the Cthaeh and when I learned of Shammaeloth I found my interest heightened due to him being similar but more dangerous due his 'activeness'. I suppose to tie both of my questions up, do you plan on exploring the Darklands/Shammaeloth anymore in your next Licanius book?",

But that's not to say I'd never tell more backstory there, either... it's just more likely to come up as an aspect of another story, rather than be the focus of one. \n\nThat's interesting! I never made that connection myself but I do love Kingkiller, so it's entirely possible The Cthaeh had some subconscious influence there. \n\nThanks and hope you're enjoying TWOTM!",

The series has sold more than a million copies to date across all formats.\n\nCould you speak to the motivations behind switching from a successful self-published arrangement to a traditional publisher?

It was a decision that looking back seems so obviously the right choice, but at the time I was close to 50/50 on because the self-published version was doing so well. I didn\u2019t actively pursue the switch \u2013 I was actually approached by my now-agent, who, as you said, convinced me that the exposure of being traditionally published would more than offset the cut on each individual sale. And he was right!\n\nSo yeah, largely it was a financial / career decision (with the added personal bonus of getting to see my book in bookstores, which I tried not to give too much influence but deep down, was also a pretty exciting prospect). Otherwise, the appeal was mostly that I could focus on writing above everything else. Funnily enough I was a little hesitant at first about working with an editor, but that proved to be a completely unfounded worry, as every editor I\u2019ve worked with has been wonderful. And things like advertising, cover design and so on I\u2019ve been very happy to have input into, but largely let the professionals take the reins. \n\nProbably obvious from the above, but it's all worked out as well as I could have hoped: I\u2019m in a vastly better position professionally, and along the way I\u2019ve had nothing but great experiences with everyone I\u2019ve worked with.

I took several years of Latin in school and noticed most of the Vetusian (Latin) grammar in the series is spot on, which from my experience is pretty rare to see in Roman-inspired literature. Did you have a personal background in the language in school, or was the linguistic element done in consultation with others who have experience in the language? I guess I could also ask how you did the translations for the few Cymrian/Welsh lines that also appear.\n\nOn a further note, if you don't mind answering, are the different nations of the Hierarchy intended to be parallels in scope and size to their corresponding Earth countries, or just nods/associations for the reader to make in terms of name, language, and culture?",

I came up with the idea before the series being turned into audio was ever in play, though, so I give myself a pass on that one. \n\nBut in terms of its purpose - it was really kind of to emphasize how Tal was thinking of Elliavia, putting her on far too high a pedestal even for someone he loved - essentially idolizing her (in the religious sense), and thus willing to try and alter the Grand Plan to bring her back.",

Where can I follow for more info on upcoming events like this?\n\nIn the event you're back on Monday I'll post a couple questions I had. Thanks for being a wonderful human! \n\n\n1. What does a plotting session for your series look like? I've never seen such sussinct, efficient storytelling and as an aspiring author I'm in awe of how much each scene does to progress the plot. I'd love to know your methodology for planning that out, as in depth as you are capable of describing it.\n\n2. Your characters are also fantastic and I can see elements of Kvothe in the way you constructed Vis, definitely a bit of Edward Elric as well. I'm curious what your approach is to combining characters and plot, do you have plot elements that you need a character to fit into, then you look for inspiration? Or do you add characters in and let their personality grow naturally?\n\n\nEven if I don't get a response I wish you all the success, about 8 or 9 of those 1 million copies sold are definitely from me because I am adamant that everyone reads your work and more than willing to put my money where my mouth is on that account, and from what I've read of Will so far I have no doubt I'll be doing the same!",

Twitter / Facebook / Goodreads (links in original post) are by far the best places - I'm not super active on social media but if I'm ever doing something like this, I'll be posting about it there.\n\n1. It starts out very messy! The main thing for me is to have a crystal clear idea of what I want to do with the story as a whole - where I want it to end, how I want it to culminate. The bones of the story get built out from there until I have a bunch of general arcs, character arcs, big scenes, themes I want to explore. And then I end up writing several drafts, with the first draft being fairly exploratory, a lot getting added or changed as I go until it all fits together. It usually doesn't make sense as a beginning-to-end story until after the second draft is done. But I really think it's that initial knowing where I'm going that allows me to make sure each scene is purposeful.\n\n2. Sometimes one, sometimes the other! Sometimes a character gets created in response to a specific plot need, and sometimes (and this happens often in the first draft), I realise a character wouldn't do what I originally outlined them doing, and so have to find other ways to make that plot point work. So to some extent I do let the characters grow naturally, and make sure not to let the plot force them into making decisions they wouldn't normally make. But because I'm always heading towards a goal, I try not to let that get the plot too off track, either. There's always a good solution - sometimes it just takes a lot of thinking to find it!\n\n(3 - your q below). Word doc. I tried Scrivener and a bunch of other methods, but in the end, a big Word document is what works for me.\n\nThank you!! And hope you enjoy The Will of the Many as well!",

I found with both series that I came up with plenty of ideas for how magic could be used creatively as I was writing a scene, rather than planning it out that way beforehand. Sort of an 'oh of course it can be used like that!' moment, and then you can use that concept moving forward. So both my series' magic systems changed in various ways over the course of the first few drafts of their first books - they kind of grew organically out of the story. Hope that helps!",

Clearly a lot of thought and foreshadowing went into achieving this. My question is was this ending, particularly how Caeden\u2019s story ends, always the envisioned end point of the story, like a core central idea from which everything else evolved, or did it develop to that point over time as you worked on the series? It just always felt like the sort of idea that pops into your head that is strong enough to build an entire story around, but I was curious if that was actually the case or not. \n\nRegardless of if you have the chance to answer or not, I just wanted to let you know how amazing I thought Licanius was.

And agreed, Michael Kramer absolutely did a phenomenal job. \n\n\r  \nTo my mind, the darker aspects of Hierarchy are about on the same level as Licanius. \r  \n\n\nWhen we started the discussion with Audible about who should narrate, the first name I mentioned was naturally Michael\u2019s \u2013 but the producer immediately (and quite rightly) pointed out that because this book is from the first person perspective of a 17 year old, his voice, amazing as it is, just wasn\u2019t the best fit. So I listened to a bunch of other narrators and suggested Euan, who we were then fortunate enough to be able to get on board.\n\n\r  \nAnd I know I\u2019m biased, but he really does an amazing job! I was so pleased. Euan\u2019s an accomplished stage actor - I believe he\u2019s currently on Broadway playing King George in Hamilton - as well as an award-winning narrator. Plus, if it\u2019s any help, the Audible ratings for the Will of the Many are sitting at 4.9/5 from 95 reviews... so it\u2019s not just me who approves. \n\nRegardless, totally understand being hesitant to try a new narrator - a bad one can genuinely ruin a book - but I hope that somewhat helps to sway you!",

Especially adult epic fantasy.  \n\nI'll be honest, the authors I know of are through reputation and not because I've read their books - not because I'm not interested(!), but simply because I don't read anywhere near as much as I used to these days. But there's Jay Kristoff, Amy Kaufman, Garth Nix, Trudi Canavan... again, I can't actually recommend anything specific of theirs, but I know they're all very popular so if you're looking for more from Aussie writers, they're definitely worth checking out!",

Australian physical release isn't until 18th July, so not before then (and then I'm actually away for a bit directly after)... but I believe there may be things in the works. I'll definitely post on social media (Twitter / Facebook / Goodreads) if and when anything's happening... keep an eye out!",

Sweeping scope, end of the world stakes, cool magic powers, good versus evil. And when I wrote Licanius, that was the feeling I was going for.\n\nLater inspirations - Brandon Sanderson, Patrick Rothfuss, and I'd put Pierce Brown in there as well now. Sanderson for his sense of plot - he basically showed me that fantasy books could have awesome, fulfilling twists - and the way he always brings everything together so well at the end. Rothfuss because fifteen+ years on, Name of the Wind is still the best 'magic academy' book I've ever read (and I find his prose is inspiring, too, even if I'm not going to claim to be trying to emulate it!). And Brown for his sense of unrelenting pace, but managing to keep his story very human and grounded at the same time. All three of them were definitely an influence on Hierarchy.",

Otherwise there were undoubtedly points at which I found the writing harder, but no more than usual - no scene or section in particular that stands out in my memory!",

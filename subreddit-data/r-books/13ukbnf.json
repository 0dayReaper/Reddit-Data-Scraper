    "postText": "I know, I'm like super late to it. I always meant to read it but my tbr list has been incredibly long for multiple years now.\n\nAnyways, about the actual book. I am INCREDIBLY unwell. Like, I've been processing it for about 12 hours now and the sad feeling in my chest keeps getting worse as more time passes. I knew Greek mythology so I knew how it would end, but oh my god it hurt so much more than I thought it would. Seeing the relationship between Patroclus and Achilles evolve over however many years they knew each other was absolutely incredible and the ending successfully ripped my heart right out of my chest. The worst part for me was how Patroclus was kept from the underworld and separated from Achilles for so long. I can't even begin to imagine how painful that situation could be. As gut wrenching as it was, though, it's seriously one of my favorite books that I've ever read. Their entire story was perfect imo. All the tender, passionate moments as well as the few times they fought or disagreed over an issue. I don't normally cry because of books or movies, but I was basically sobbing while reading the last couple chapters. I honestly think this book has completely changed my brain chemistry and I am in love with it. I probably won't ever fully emotionally recover, but honestly I don't think I want to. \n\nOverall I think Madeline Miller did an amazing job at telling the beautiful story of Achilles and Patroclus. I would love to share these thoughts with someone I know in real life but sadly my one friend who's actually read it does not like Miller's writing style so she didn't really the book.",

This one was recommended to me and, even though I knew how it would end, I was crying by the time I got there. Beautifully written.\n\nI finished it late at night and couldn't sleep for hours. I kept going back to re-read sections that had moved me, and it's definitely one I'll read again the future. Slowly. With many cups of tea.",

But they're very similar in a lot of ways. \n\nPersonally, I found myself often thinking, while reading SoA, \"This is a really solid book, but I'm not sure why anyone feels the need to re-tell this story,\" and then, bam, when the why becomes clear, which isn't until the very end, it just floored me.",

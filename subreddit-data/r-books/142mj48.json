    "postText": "I generally do not, but that seems to be unusual. Without fail, most of the reviews of the mystery thriller books I\u2019ve read say that they predicted the ending about 50% into the book. Meanwhile, I\u2019m sitting there shocked at the endings because I didn\u2019t predict it at all or I feel like the author gave me enough doubt to second-guess myself. Maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t read a lot of mystery thrillers or I\u2019m just naive. I don\u2019t have the same problem with the genre if it\u2019s a movie or tv show, but books are just different. \n\nHere are the ones I read recently with that feeling:\n-Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn\n-Before I Go To Sleep by SJ Watson\n-The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides",

I sometimes guess the culprit, but it's more of an intuition that's not based on any evidence so I just consider it luck rather than amazing detective capabilities, I don't think anyone is dumb or naive for not guessing the ending. I generally don't mind when I guess the ending, I don't think it ruins the book or makes it 'predictable'.",

This is because, the story is actually at the hands of the writer, and they have an unfair advantage over you at every point. You might have theories of your own, all to get banished at a turning point somewhere towards the end. The writer can use the seemingly unimportant descriptions made beforehand, to completely banish your speculations and leave you surprised. Maybe, that is what makes a good Mystery/Thriller writer.\n\nBut, nevertheless, you must try hard to battle your wits with that of the writer.

I don\u2019t always guess super early on, sometimes it\u2019s only a few chapters before the reveal, and I actually find that super satisfying \u2014 I get to solve the mystery on my own, but not in a way where I spend half the book yelling at the characters \u201cit\u2019s obviously them!\u201d Usually if I guess early on, it\u2019s because the author is following a particular trope religiously. For instance, I hate the \u201cmurderer is the last person the MC suspects\u201d trope because it\u2019s always so easy to pick out after having read a few of them. Oh, character B has motive and opportunity but MC never considers them even for a moment because they\u2019re so doggedly following the obvious red herring? Or, they suspect every single other character except character B? Whelp, mystery solved.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely a balance for me for enjoyment. I like trying to guess \u2014 I want it to feel like a challenge, but also an achievable one. Nothing feels cheaper to me than when the author withholds all information that supports the reveal. Like, yeah, I had no idea that character A did X, but there was also no indication that X even happened prior to the reveal, so what exactly is the payoff here? \n\nMy favorite style of mystery is where many characters are suspicious enough that even if I guess correctly, I\u2019m never totally sure of my answer until the end. Either that, or stories that have enough twists that you can guess one or two and then be so distracted by those that you totally miss the third!",

Granted, I don't read a ton of mysteries, so I can't say I'm used to the formulas like other folks are whereas I'm usually pretty good at guessing movie &amp; TV show twists.",

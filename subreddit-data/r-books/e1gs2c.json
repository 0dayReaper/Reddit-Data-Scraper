            "comment": "Glad to see this. We have a local independent bookstore in my neighborhood and it certainly seems to have a booming business. It's not large, but they have a ton of events monthly and often have authors come speak - and many are decently well known authors. On top of that, the staff are incredibly helpful, the selection is great (and they will order what you want as well) and they have suggestion tags hanging on the shelves by certain books that I really enjoy reading every time I come in. It's not always the cheaper option, but the experience is much better than buying online or going to a larger chain store.",

Then Amazon killed of the big bookstores which gave room for small bookstores to thrive.\n\nI believe Amazon and small bookstores serve different markets. If I know exactly what I want and it's a bit obscure I can order off of Amazon. If I just want a new book to read I like to go to a small bookstore where the selection is curated and I can browse and read a few pages before committing to a purchase.",

I remember in grad school I had a professor talking about how you want to be really really big (Economies of Scale, volume, etc.) or really small (customer centric, personalization). Being stuck in the middle will kill a lot of companies. The big bookstores got caught in the middle once Amazon rapidly expanded.",

The mall back in my home town had a Waldenbooks, and during their final few years they:\n\n* Refused a free sign on the front of the mall to advertise their presence. They had no sign on the main marquee, no sign on the front of the building, and refused a free one because \"then we'd need a sign for all of our stores\". Generosity on the part of the malls themselves was refused in the name of parity.\n* Refused to fund or help organize events of any kind. No author events, no big release events (even for Harry Potter), and no funding for anything the store owners would cobble together on their own time and dime.\n* Refused to allow store owners to customize their stock to match local clientele. If the store owner wanted a large section of econ books in NYC, too bad, you need to stock the required trashy romance novels in that section. If you wanted a large section of trashy romance novels for your suburban housewife customers, too bad, you need to keep the required number of econ books on the shelf.",

Places like BestBuy, Circuit City, etc. They tried to win the battle over smaller independent stores by being the one stop shop for electronics and media. However they ultimately couldn't hold a candle to Amazon in inventory and logistics of scale when all was said and done. Meanwhile you have trends for some folk to continue embracing physical copies of media and they have gravitated to the niche shops (I'm thinking vinyl and record stores) over online or big box. While the majority of the rest of the consumer base will be fine just going to Amazon or someone like Walmart who better won the mixed online vs brick and mortart blend for mass appeal.",

And although I've personally gone back to vinyl and it's now outselling CD's I still don't think that was a smart move.  At my local store they got rid of the large DVD back section and replaced all of that with kid's toys, games, puzzles, figurines, etc and moved DVD's to a couple of strips of DVD racks int he front of the store.  B&amp;N has been in trouble for quite some time and I've noticed that in places I travel to for business some of their stores have closed.\n\nI can't understand how they're surely able to recognize with hindsight what killed off Borders and don't see themselves going down the same path.",

It's not like you stock more books and then you sell more - the reading population moves at pretty in-built pace, and is not affected too much by what's available in stores (for the most part).\n\nBut it's impossible in this economy for a company to react normally to shrinking markets.

I will admit I generally just purchase through amazon as I usually have a title I'm going for and it's cheap/convenient. However many times I have ended up purchasing through a niche shop because they actually have the book I'm looking for (I'll get foreign language stuff on occassion and these I've especially found to be through independent retailers). \n\nSo in a way Amazon simply grew to a level that couldn't be matched while still maintaining massive store fronts, and they adopted the niche guys into their platform instead of having to manage inventory on low churn titles. Which allows a space to exist for those smaller neighborhood stores who can capture the brick and mortar purists while augmenting their revenue online without really needing to build some form of online name recognition.",

We'll spend 30-45 minutes with a customer finding the perfect recommendation for them just so they can say \"Oh it's $2 cheaper on Amazon, I'll just get it there\". This happens multiple times a day. This thread, not you in particular, has spawned some ideas that independent bookstores finally \"wisened up\" and started doing author events and making recommendations when that's what we've been doing all along. Barnes and Noble did not create author signings. It's some weird capitalist idea that it's all survival of the fittest, but there's really no way to compete against Amazon at all. They sell books at cost or barely above, they underpay their employees, they don't pay taxes, they own their own delivery service.\n\nPeople just like going to bookstores, and Amazon killing B&amp;T and Borders has basically forced people to go to independents. Which is good, the services we've been providing are being utilized more and more, but with Amazon now getting into brick and mortar stores, we're about to go toe to toe with the titan itself.\n\nI guess what I'm laboring to get at is that there really aren't different markets between indies and Amazon, there's a huge overlap. People like going into stores but they also like convenience. You can be a genius all you want but you'll still get crushed under the giants foot. Business is booming, but unless people stop supporting Amazon, we're next.",

At first it seemed like big box retail would win out, or at least snuff out the independents before losing to online, but given the more one stop shop approach of those places it makes sense the conveinence seekers just jumped to online options while those actually appreciating the feeling of brick and mortar (prior to box stores) have continued to gravitate to actual local establishments. \n\nI'm glad some local establishments were able to weather the storm and make it to this point.",

If you just want a transaction, you buy from the cheapest option which is big stores, or more often, Amazon. But if you want more than that - a sense of community and connecting with other readers - you go to the small bookstore.\n\nI'm pretty impressed that small stores realise that they're selling an experience and not actually competing on cost. That's why they host all these peripheral activities which strengthen the shared experience.",

Some from friends and teachers.  I had one today that was something to the tune of a father giving 20,000 leagues under the sea to his child and a nice written note dated 1915. Always fun to open them up and see what you\u2019ll find",

It was really fascinating. The tactile element of our relationship to books as meaningful objects in themselves is something that I can really relate to, as well!",

By offering better selection at lower prices, they were able to wreck the business model of the small bookstores - and many perished.\n\nHowever, Amazon in turn wrecked the business model of the large chain bookstores for the same reason.\n\nWhat remains is a small bookstore that is less a 'bookstore' than a 'third space' - a place for people to gather around common interests.\n\nTo some extent, this poses a problem for the small bookstore owner since they aren't truly in the business of 'selling books' any longer. Rather, they're in the business of creating the equivalent of the local pub for book lovers. While they'll happily take your money in exchange for printed material, what they're really looking to do is establish the book store as part of your routine where you stop by and check up on your friends - and somehow monetize that experience.",

We had tables and couches and stuff but we eventually had to take them out because homeless people would come in and camp out.\n\nI never had a problem with the homeless people who would come in and sit and read. But some would come in and just sleep on a couch, or a table, and snore loudly.  Some would come in absolutely reeking of booze or god knows what. One of the big final straws was that a guy came in, shit himself while sitting down, sat there for a bit to warm it up, then got up and left a trail of shit all the way through the store. It creates security concerns. And health concerns. And somebody had to clean that up.\n\nOf course normal people used that stuff too, and like I said many of the homeless people were just fine. But there's always some who ruin it for everybody.\n\nAs for people sitting on the floor: we also had to tell people not to sit on the floor, the reason being that it was a fire hazard and if we got a visit from a fire marshal, it would be very bad. And people were constantly sitting on the floor so we had to be kind of aggressive about it.\n\nAll of this was definitely exacerbated by this store being in a city center, not out in the middle of a suburb.",

First, big chain stores charge ridiculous prices for books. I\u2019m very poor and I don\u2019t want to spent thirty bucks on a hardcover book. Or even ten bucks on a softcover I will read in a couple of days. So I goto the indie, second hand store. They have multiple advantages: price (like five to seven bucks depending in book. Some even cheaper like three dollar) selection (they have thousands upon thousands of used books so I can find cult classics out of print instead of being forced to buy whatever new James Patterson book is out. Plenty of big chain bookstores stock mainly  the big hits and I\u2019ve read many of them.) atmosphere (the used bookstore is like a library and has that musty old books smell. Feels like treasure hunt8ng rather than shopping with the stocked shelves floor to ceiling) staff (the owner saw I bought Rebecca and asked if I liked it and if I had read anything else by the author, Daphne Du Maurier. I read his recommendations and she\u2019s one of my fav authors now. I had no expectation for recommendations or even that the owner would remember me or what I bought but he did and it was really special).\n\nThey also accept trade ins (I\u2019m not reading many books twice) and if they don\u2019t want to buy what you drop off, they\u2019ll donate it or recycle the materials into reusable pulp.)",

Books draw more people in to their site where they end up buying other products that Amazon  actually earns a profit on. This is why a book on Amazon is always going to be cheaper than the same book at your local bookstore selling at list price - Amazon can afford to not make a profit. Your local bookstore cannot. \n\nAs such, Amazon has managed to become the source of 40% + of all publisher\u2019s (big 5 and the little guys) revenue. Publishers can\u2019t afford not work with them. \n\nMore people buying books on Amazon = more local mom and pop bookstores closing = the more power Amazon wields over publishing companies. \n\nThe more power Amazon wields over publishing companies, the more they can get away with. Ex: claiming massive \u201cshortages\u201d even though companies can provide tracking proof that the books arrived, demanding even higher discounts, etc. \n\nPlease support your local bookstores. That extra $3 you\u2019re spending is so worth it.\n\nSource: work in publishing.",

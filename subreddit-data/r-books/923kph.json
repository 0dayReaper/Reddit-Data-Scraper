Encyclopedia Brown was my boy.\n\nEDIT: I love the nostalgia thread my post seems to have spawned. In a comment below, I confess that I never did give the Hardy Boys a fair shake. I liked the covers and the idea of young detectives, but I think I was low-key rebelling against my family\u2019s idea that \u201cgood boys read Hardy Boys\u201d. Or something like that lol",

            "comment": "The definition presented in the article is wrong.\n\nYeah, I'm gonna nitpick this as a linguistics (and Japanese) enthusiast.\n\nI'm not going to argue the origin of the word -- seems solid.  \u7a4d\u3093\u3067\u304a\u304f (*tsundeoku*) means \"to pile up\" and is a verb.  \u7a4d\u3093\u8aad  (*tsundoku*) is a compound with the verbal \"to pile up\" and the nominal \"book\" or \"to accrue book(s).\" The definition in the article claims that *tsundoku* is a noun -- this would be *an accrued collection of books* but that is not the definition they provide. No, they define:\n\n&gt;**tsundoku** (*noun*) buying books and not reading them; letting books pile up unread on shelves or floors and nightstands\n\nWhat's the problem? They're defining the word to be a noun with a verbal definition!\n\nAlso, if we want the concept in English, may I propose the term *booklog*, it's a fun play on the term *backlog* (\"an accumulation of something, especially uncompleted work or matters that need to be dealt with\"), which I hope is obvious, and gives us a clever way of handling nominal and verbal roles:\n\n* \"I really want to pick this up, but I have such a huge booklog.\"\n* \"I'd get this for grampa's birthday, but he's so booklogged I'm not sure he'd ever get to it.\"\n* \"Well, here's another title for the booklog.\"\n\nI know we love to cannibalize words from other languages, and I know that sometimes other languages have awesome words that express things our language lacks. I just think this is a case where a neologism is a more practical choice than trying to explain Japanese grammar and how to use *tsundoku* to English speakers. Plus, I personally hate to hear english speakers butchering words that begin with *ts* like *tsunami* or *tsundere*, so there's a personal element to this too.\n\nI don't think *tsundoku* is a useless word -- but I do think it's something that only a tiny amount of thought could be applied to and leave us with a calque of the word to make it easier to use for English speakers.",

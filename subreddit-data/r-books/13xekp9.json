I think the professor was retiring so I doubt the course is offered now but what a good time.",

            "comment": "**Field** **Notes From A Hidden City, by Esther Woolfson**\n\nThe author spent a year keeping a detailed nature diary in the last place you would ever expect that to be possible. Over the course of a year, she records the habits and changes of the natural world around her, as it looks from the middle of urban Aberdeen. The trees in her local park, the weeds that grow around the edges of pavement, the spiders and mice that share her home and garden, urban birds like pigeons and seagulls\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful thoughtful reflection on her own relationship with nature. It\u2019s also a really important reminder that you don\u2019t **have to** have access to \u201cmiles and miles of untouched wilderness\u201d to experience or bond with the natural world in a meaningful way. Many people - I would go so far as to say most people, now - don\u2019t have the luxury of exploring remote wilderness any more, which makes it really important to think about how we might experience/appreciate nature within the limits of what we do have.\n\nThe way I thought about my - intensely urban - home changed dramatically because of this book.",

Whilst this is obviously a book that covers human settlements rather than the outdoors, I would recommend it here because it helps demonstrate the beauty of nature.\n\nFeet in the Clouds - Richard Askwith\n\nA classic book about the history of British Fellrunning, covering history, a year in the life of the sport, and the author's attempts to complete the Bob Graham 24 hour challenge within the time limit. Excellent read, and partly responsible for a revival in the sport.",

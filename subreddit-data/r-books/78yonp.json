If they thought racism was a problem and we need to deal with it, the discomfort caused by the book would be entirely worthwhile, even necessary.     So banning a book on the pretext that it makes people uncomfortable also means that racism does not matter to them, or even that they think it's overblown.    ",

Fahrenheit 451 showed a world where no one wanted it.\" Both are great dystopian novels with a focus on censorship, but (thankfully) we're not at Fahrenheit 451 yet.\n\nEDIT: A lot of replies say that Fahrenheit 451 is not about censorship. I am aware Ray Bradbury himself has said the main theme of the book is not censorship. However, while most of the book focuses on lack of initiative to seek knowledge (which can be construed as self-censorship), there certainly is an oppressive, anti-information regime in place, given Montag's occupation.",

He predicted, for instance, the ways in which technology, in the control of powerful elites, can control our decision-making with social media, pornography, the commercialisation of sex, advertising and reality TV. He foresaw the ubiquitous prevalence of drugs, both legal and illegal, and how pharmaceuticals such as Ritalin would sedate growing numbers of children. Genetic engineering, euthanasia, a national lottery and even corruption at the top of world sport are all a part of his nightmare future. A more abstract (and perhaps even more relevant) detail that is striking in Brave New World is the inverted distinction between public and private. In Brave New World, relationships are out in the open. Everybody knows everybody else\u2019s business, though not in the scurrilous neighborhood gossip way. Today people put up their entire life on social media, and when everyone is watching everyone else the need to conform becomes more important. Stress is managed by the ingestion of mass-distributed drugs. The powerful end up controlling the masses not through violent oppression and fear, but by making them so completely inoculated in entertainment and short term pleasures that they don't even care to stand up against the powers to be.

Don't people understand we are living in a outlier age? never before have we been more safe. maybe that is why we have to make up enemies? don't get me wrong we do need to be carefull to not become 1984. but *come on* P.S: i do realise OP might have been joking but there are enough people who believe this that i feel warrented to give this reaction. like the stupid argument; \"what would the founding fathers say?\" who the fuck cares? they would shit their pants if they say what kind of technology we have now. their view point does not matter in the least.

Even if 95% of a districts parents don't have a problem, they will fight tooth and nail for that 5 percent. Here is the catch though, it's only for stupid, unimportant, petty shit. A parent complains about they don't like a cafeteria using gas stoves because it exposes their child to dangerous fumes? You bet the food service director got 10 emails from admins about it. A few parents complain about bad words in a book? BOOM Banned!\n\nBut if it is something that they really should care about then the administration is doing everything correctly and no changes will be made. Yes hundreds of parents are complaining about the bus routes being so fucked up that kids are not getting home until 2 hours after dismissing, but 3 parents don't like the color of the student handbook.

The officer told us how a small lady took some of the PCP and was able to fight off five large officers, and another guy took some and punched right through a window. (When I got older, I realized he probably took this story from The Terminator movie). \n\nI knew I had to get some PCP and take it at recess so I could become the small version of the Incredible Hulk and beat the shit out of everyone that made fun of me.

Such depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. While the following does not represent the Warner Bros. view of today\u2019s society, these cartoons are being presented as they were originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming that these prejudices never existed.\n\nI feel like this is the right way to approach it, because \"pretending like it never happened\" is how you end up with a lot of people growing up thinking it's not a big deal or \"just a joke\". See also those textbooks saying \"yeah Columbus came over and the people who were living here just decided to up and move out of the goodness of their hearts and everyone was happy!\" If you don't want to repeat past mistakes as a society, people need to be aware that they happened in the first place.",

I am glad students will be allowed to continue the book.\n\nFor the lovely people here who are throwing blanket generalizations over the state - Not everyone here wallows in ignorance. Some of us work diligently to make this state better. Life is tough here: This state has so many problems. We vote against our own interests constantly, and that fact leads to many of our problems. Right now, our state government has drawn a bead, to borrow Scout's expression, on public education, underfunding our schools that are lifelines for our impoverished students. Yet, I stay. Each day I hope to make even the smallest difference in a kid's life. I hate and love this state at the same time.",

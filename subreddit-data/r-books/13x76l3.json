    "postText": "I've come across a number of books that were unlike anything else I had read before. And given that I have not read as much as many of you book lovers, finding a book unique really does not really say much about the book and more about me.\n\nHaving said that, for me it was Kafka's The Metamorphosis. That was a book I enjoyed but then thought, that was such a weird book. One Hundred Years of Solitude was another book that felt like I had just watched a magic show.\n\nAn unusual book I did *not* like and could not get past the first couple of pages (because I understood ZERO) was *Finnegans Wake*.\n\nI was asking this question of my dad, btw, and he said The Bible. I had never thought of it that way but I guess that is also a strange and unique book.\n\nLast but not least, there is a book that visually was quite arresting. It's called S and it's by Dorst. And this is what the book looks like:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/0y7fvFd.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0y7fvFd.jpg)",

The narrators include Nick Offerman, David Sedaris, George Saunders himself, and MANY (100+) others. It just makes it easier to follow because you can hear the different voices and identify who is talking, rather than waiting until after they've finished talking to find out who said it.\n\nAlso, for anyone who hasn't seen it, [this video from the New York Times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuCt50JCk8&amp;t=508s) is really cool. You can click around to control your perspective as more people show up to speak.",

It's as if Cort\u00e1zar looked at the notion of 'beginning, middle, and end,' flipped it the bird, and said, 'Nah, I'm gonna do my own thing.'\n\nThis isn't a novel to passively consume. You don't sit back and let \"Hopscotch\" wash over you. Instead, you're an active participant, hopping around the narrative like a caffeine-addled kangaroo, each leap uncovering a new piece of the puzzle. It's an exhilarating, maddening, dizzying ride.

            "comment": "One Hundred Years of Solitude was definitely a favorite read. But as I think of it, the reading experience of any well written or creative book can depend on what time in your life you are reading it. For instance, as a child I learned Shakespeare\u2019s plays by sitting on my Dads lap in our Library while listening to recordings of the plays and reading them at the same time. Macbeth blew my mind at age 6! Hamlet was my favorite play at 8. \nJames Fenimore Cooper\u2019s Leatherstocking Tales at age 10 opened my mind to my country\u2019s history. \nAt 65, I\u2019m re-reading Steinbeck, Thomas Hardy, C.S. Lewis, E.M. Forester and discovering their beauty all over again. Another book for me was Truman Capote\u2019s In Cold Blood when I was in my 30\u2019s. The absolute craftsmanship of his writing stunned me. Another example for me in my 20\u2019s was taking a college class on Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings and discussing it twice a week. It was an Incredible experience I still remember clearly. When I was 18 or 19, I read 84 Charing Cross Road and it was a love story I found both enlightening and tragic. I was experiencing love for the first time in my life at the time.\nI love books and reading. I\u2019ll never have enough time to read everything I want and still sleep; I still average 6,000 to 8,000 pages a month and feel I want more.\nA great question and thank you for letting me ramble on. Reading is such a beautiful thing to do with your mind.",

Protagonist 1 is looking for protagonist 2 while P2 goes blithely about his life traveling a road through time.  When they exit the road, they're in a different time &amp; place.  Chapters are marked 1 &amp; 2 to show which protagonists timeline they're in &amp; culminate in the two meeting.  Zelazny wrote the story linearly then stapled each chapter together.  He then pulled out all the chapter 2s, tossed them in the air, &amp; randomly inserted them back between the chapter 1s.  While I got the gist of the story on the first read, it took two to really appreciate.  It's a short book &amp; well worth the time.\n\n\"Doorways in the Sand\" has each chapter start in the middle of the action, look back to the beginning &amp; then conclude on a cliff hanger. Then start the next chapter without the cliff hanger being resolved - it must be, but we don't know how. We get caught up in the new situation, only to be brought back to resolving the original situation &amp; then work ourselves back into the next cliff hanger &amp; start it all over again.  It's very effective for keeping the suspense up &amp; not as confusing as you might think to read. The story isn't that complex, so it is easily followed. Again, short book &amp; well worth the time.\n\n\"Creatures of Light &amp; Darkness\"  was an exercise for himself &amp; he never expected to publish it. He mentioned it to an editor who begged him for it &amp; was surprised that it did so well.  He said he threw everything he had at this novel, in no particular order. It is an amalgamation of styles, mythologies, SF &amp; Fantasy. Somehow, it really works. That's as amazing as is my fascination for the book, re-reading it for the tenth time or so in 40 years. It was every bit as entertaining.",

The second reads like a fever dream. The third begs to be ripped apart and pieced back together just to hear one specific characters story (which would also in turn help you solve the overall mystery). All done with extremely novel world building, characters, and humor.\n\nI\u2019ve been making an effort to not buy books anymore but had to break that rule for myself. I plan to go back and highlight/tab things to piece it all together. Can\u2019t wait to see what Muir does in the upcoming fourth book!",

Dark satire and magical surrealism with plenty to say (that couldn\u2019t be said out loud during that time) about communism, Stalin, and what was happening to the people of that time.\n\nPlease tell me someone else on here loved this book! \ud83d\ude02",

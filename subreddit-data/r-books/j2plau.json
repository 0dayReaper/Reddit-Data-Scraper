    "postText": "Just something that I find quite annoying when looking for a new book, especially when trying to pick up a classic. I don't mind if there's a few reviews or even an opening paragraph that talks about the novels success but please give me some idea of what its actually about.\n\nAn example: To Kill a Mockingbird. I've been trying to catch up on some classics and this book was not taught in my high school and surprisingly, I know very little about its plot. It's back cover and Goodreads synopsis is nothing but praise and I don't to ruin it by reading the Wikipedia plot. \n\nDoes this bother anyone else?",

I filled out a card with general information and hoped for the best. I ended up with the second Outlander book which I enjoyed. Another one I remember liking was a non-fiction book about an early expedition to Antarctica (I think it was 'Endurance'). The one that surprised me the most was around an 800 page fiction about the opium trade in India in the early 1800s. I really wish I could remember the name of that one. Worst experience was putting Harry Potter as a possible choice and receiving some evangelical fanatic's book about how Harry Potter was the devil (it even used the HP font which I thought was ballsy).",

It is about time spent doing the activity more than anything else. To spend time on it requires enjoyment though, so that is the biggest part.\n\n(Assuming reading speed of 300 words a minute and 100k words per book.)\n\nHopefully you had a lot of fun in the other activities you spent the time on. I would highly recommend audio books if commutes takes up a lot of time. If 1h commute in one direction you can probably average a book a week from it.",

Honestly though, I think if they DID go into showing more of the problems Watney experienced, they'd get into the territory of \"We get it already, his life sucks, move on!\" for a good portion of the audience.\n\nStill though....it would only have taken like an extra 2 minutes to add in the problems of Pathfinder. As the writer of XKCD put it \"Never have I seen so accurately depicted that moment of utter horror when you realize that you have accidentally just irretrievably bricked something that you absolutely cannot do without as in The Martian.\".",

The purpose of an intro or that little bit on the back cover or inner jacket *should* be to draw potential readers in with the first plot hooks they\u2019d get in the first chapter, and summarize the setting/basic ideas so that readers know if they\u2019re in for a love triangle or what. Revealing any more than the first major plot hook/twist is just ruining the book (think chosen one; revealing that the MC is a \u2018chosen one\u2019 in whatever way is usually presented as a bit of a twist/grand reveal at the beginning of the book, and can be included safely most of the time).\n\nMan, I just want to know if I\u2019m in for some Unnecessary YA Romance^TM (looking at you, Glass Throne, I just want people to be friends and be much less dramatic about it) or what.

They all happily agreed to wait until page 100 to throw the book at the wall. \n\nNone of them ever did. \n\nIt\u2019s a great book.",

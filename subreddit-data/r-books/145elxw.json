I have asked family, friends, co workers, etc. It's very rare I find someone who reads. I don't think this is correct, in my opinion. \n\nDo you think this number is accurate?",

A cookbook if you looked at all the recipes? \n\nBut let's say it's just books with mostly text - the one book per year is pretty much what I see people I know who are not typical readers do. They will get (usually) a bestseller for their summer or winter vacation or pick up the popular non fiction every once in a while.",

What were the raw results?\n\nWhether anyone 'agrees' is irrelevant. Details of the supposed study are relevant (even though results would of course have been totally dependent on self-reporting)\n\nSo no, OP, I don't agree nor disagree. I'm curious though about where you got that 'around 75%'.",

Should I change my answer every time I'm asked the same thing?\n\nAnd of course I'll disagree. Is this not a discussion? Someone challenges me, I challenge them. If this isn't meant to be a discussion than why even post on here? If I'm not allowed to disagree than this post would be silly.

But just to break it down and make it really simple for you, this is what just happened:\n\n- You: I have done my own informal survey which is inconsistent with surveys that use representative samples and a sample size likely ten times greater my own. I think my own informal surveys is correct!\n\n- Me: It is hilarious you think your unrepresentative survey would be more accurate than an actual survey using a representative sample.\n\n- You: Well I posted about it here because it's my opinion and I wanted to see what others said so I can be more accurate.\n\n- Me: Okay, but when people tell you the survey is actually accurate you say they're wrong.\n\n- You: Well, of course they're wrong! \n\nCan you not see that you're talking bullshit here? First you argued that you posted here to get more accuracy to see what people say. But then you say \"well, I'm not going to accept what they say, I'm going to disagree\". So, your first position is bullshit. \n\nAnyway, I'm not going to debate someone who's not actually interested in others' opinions but just want to rant about your own. But for the record:\n\na) From a mathematical viewpoint, it is beyond debate that a representative sample from a polling organisation/research centre like Pew is going to be more accurate than you asking people. You may be making an effort to seek a diverse set of voices, but you will not be weighting them correctly or meeting the numbers needed to have a representative sample unless you've literally asked like 400 people.\n\nb) The plural of anecdote is not data. \n\nc) And even if your own experiences are somehow more influential than a representative survey, then we have to factor in my own experiences. And I think easily 75% of the people I know have read one book a year. In fact I would say that I probably only know maybe 3-5 people who wouldn't have read a book a year.",

You're ASSUMING their survey was conducted correctly but we can't find that. So, I want to hear what others have to say. I can agree and disagree. I disagreed with many on here. But I have also agreed with others. Some people made points I didn't actually think of, which were excellent points. So I have my agreements and disagreements. I never said my own survey was correct. I'm saying through my own survey I didn't not get numbers anywhere near there's. I never gave out any formal numbers what so ever. \n\nIf someone tells me the survey is accurate than use their own family as their set of data to say it's accurate, of course i will object to that. If you noticed I asked each person on here do they think their family is a representation of America and that's what most people do? I didn't just say \"WRONG\". I asked them if they think that's the average nation wide. So again, you're using a strawman and misrepresenting what I'm saying since you don't like your opinion being challenged clearly. So what I'm saying is not BS at all. \n\nLike I said, I actually changed my mind to some degree because people pointed stuff out here that I didn't think of. Like where was the survey conducted? And 20 percent of people are illiterate. So again, what you're saying is not facts what so ever. Read everything I wrote to others instead of cherry picking.\n\nAgain, like I said numerous times. I never said my polling of people was the end all be all which is why I posted here in the first place. I'm doubting this poll because I can tell it's too high. For example, if a poll came out and said the average American eats 200 dollars worth of McDonald's a week, even if we didn't do any study what so ever we can see right off the bat something is wrong here. You might think back to your own consumption of McDonald's. Maybe friends, family, and Co workers. You might see its nowhere near that. You post on here to see other opinions and you see a few people saying \"I eat McDonald's every week around 200 dollars\" and you wouldn't question that? Not their experience but you wouldn't ask them if they think that's what the average person does? Perhaps McDonald's enthusiasts see McDonald's in the headline and they gravitate towards that post. \n\nYes, you can say that it's your opinion. That's your experiences. If you read all my comments you'll see I asked numerous times to these people with similar views where they live. Because if these people are commenting from the same areas we can get more accurate information. Someone else who worked in the city in a book store said he think 1/20 people read. He said he's from a big city. I live in the city as well. I live in both suburbs and the city. I would say he's probably about correct. I asked numerous in the city and kept getting met with a \"no\" and the culture over here doesn't approve of books. It's like another guy posted on here who is from the Midwest rural side, you get made fun of for reading. It's no different in NYC.\n\nI don't think you understand how discussions work. Don't cry when someone challenges you on your opinion. People are so sensitive these days. If you have an opinion and someone asks you a question on it don't get all upset because people have different ideas than you. \n\nNotice how I never complained ONE time when I was challenged? Notice how I challenged numerous people on here and most people did not complain when I challenged them? You're getting offended for them. It's weird. \n\nIf you can't take having your opinion criticized than this isn't the place for you. Go home to mommy so she'll be your yes man and tell you everything you want to hear.\n\nAlso, someone else just posted studies that disagreed with that study that I haven't seen yet. For example, he posted that 33 percent HS graduates do not read a single book after graduating. 80 percent of American households did not purchase a book this year. 70 percent of adults have not been in a book store in the last 5 years.\n\nSee, that's how you have a discussion. Now I can response accordingly. This is how discussions and disagreements work. Not by getting your view point challenged and than crying about it.",

What it means is that if they had a sample size of 384/385 people, there is a 95% chance that  that 70-80% of Americans read one book last year (75% +/- 5%).\n\nThis is of course based on a lot of assumptions that aren't always fulfilled. The population needs to be homogenous. Everyone in the US has an equal chance of participating. People need to tell the truth. These aren't completely fulfilled by the Pew study, but Pew accounts for this with their methodology.\n\nAlso, some studies need to be very detailed, because we need to have a very precise estimate. Like with medicine. We need to be certain that medicine will hurt no one, not 95% sure that only 0-5% of the population will be hurt.",

The majority of what our society would deem as \"successful\" people read, however there's a lot who don't.   The financially poor have similar attitudes to the blue collars but we have a strong library, Little Free Libraries everywhere, service clubs handing out books like Halloween candy so they have more access to it.

It's not in many people's cultures to do it. Or subcultures. And NY has different areas. The city is far more different than the suburbs and rural areas of NY. The city has a ton of people in it. Not making this political or anything but the vast majority of NY votes red. But the city has so many people and the vast majority of them vote blue that it turns the whole state blue. So you might see many different areas of NY but a large portion are just in the cities.\n\nThe city is full of hooligans haha its a different atmosphere over here. The suburbians do read more from my experience but the city is full of non sense. Don't be surprised if you come here and walk past someone taking a dump in a bucket haha  from what i been reading, California is worse.\n\nBelieve it or not, where you're from is far more sophisticated. Of course I never traveled there but I would put my entire bank account on it. \n\nBut even then in the suburbs where I'm from, barely anyone reads. I live in an area that is surrounded by lower, middle, and upper class people too. On average middle class. I went to a school with a mixed bunch. Nobody was reading except the \"nerds\".",

If most people don't read the title regarding books won't be any interest to them so they'll keep scrolling. Which means I'm getting those who read most and the general population is not clicking with the exception of some and then like you said most people have shared interest with their friends so they'll say everyone they know reads. \n\nIt's interesting. But for the people who swear everyone around them reads including those outside their friends group, I want to know where they live. What area they are from. Because I have strong suspicion that if I went over there and asked a bunch of people I'm going to not get the answer they are saying. Or at least I'll try seeing if there's an studies or anything conducted in that area. Or perhaps I can reach out on the internet to random people in that region.",

I absolutely don't believe this what so ever. If you were to say your family and you live in an upper class neighborhood I'd believe it. \n\nHave you ever been to a lower class neighborhood? I bounce around because I live at 2 houses. 1 in the city and 1 in the suburbs because my gf lives in the city. You come here talking about books and see if you find anyone else who does. Even in the suburbs the majority I asked do not.\n\nI absolutely do not believe you though. I knew some were going to lie, so I expected this but given all the responses yours is the only 1 that I do not believe. If you asked people from different economic backgrounds you'd know the lower class does not read books. At all.\n\nSo if you're going to respond, please be truthful.

You can say it's different outside the suburbs and city of your state. That's true, which is why I asked the question. \n\nSo where do you live that all these readers are from? Lower class neighborhoods you're talking about now? Tell me, what lower class neighborhood has these readers in it? I'm dying to hear this 1. \n\nYou're saying 10lbs of bananas is too much. Well, I say the same about books. How do you know? Did you ask others on their banana consumption? Notice how I can take something obscene and throw it back at you? You never heard of people eating 10lbs of bananas, it's rare. Same thing with reading through my experience. So how can you say 1 is ridiculous and not the other when both of us have drastically different views? \n\nAnd again, i don't believe you. You're on here just to disagree with someone.

I never said anything about this being true of all the people in my neighborhood, now or when I was a kid. I only mentioned it because you said I must be upperclass, which is a bad assumption based on shit fuck all. I answered based on _my_ experiences, and the experiences of _my_ friends, who are just small pieces of a much larger world. I obviously know these aren\u2019t the experiences of every single person, hence why I said I would never dream of extrapolating this to apply to the population at large! My experiences DON\u2019T mean anything about how everyone operates.

We might have good primary schools (depending where you live, I am in Minnesota) but adults do almost nothing to continue learning and educating themselves as they get older and become easy targets for conspiracy theories and idiot politicians and scams and all sorts of things. I wasn't saying my experience is the norm. But it's also NOT abnormal where I live. Yes, I know the stats on literacy in the US. But if you look at literacy maps, the issues are highly located in the deep south especially. So where you live will definitely color what your experience is when you are asking these types of questions. If you ask the same questions in NY or in AL, you'll get different responses I'd suspect. We live in a small town, and our public library is always busy. And the little free libraries are heavily used. But it's largely the same age groups, 40+. I don't see many 20 year olds at the library. \n\nThere is no research that is going to adequately cover 300 million people in this way. The way Pew goes about this is about as good as it gets, but it's not going to evenly apply to every demographic and location. People who like reading are more likely to participate in research about reading compared to those who can't read or don't but feel like they should. If I couldn't read and someone called to ask how much I read, I'd hang up. Whereas because I love to read I'd love to be randomly asked about it and happy to participate.",

Someone here posted they lived in Hong Kong and he would bet at most 10 percent of people read because they're busy and schooling made them hate reading.\n\nI do agree that adults don't further education after school. I only read non fiction just so I can learn. I taught myself economics just by reading a ton of economics books. Reading can do wonders for such a small price. I learned far more, not even comparable from books than I have through college. \n\nI'd agree. Perhaps it's the best we have but I think it's very misleading like you said because some people will just dismiss the study all together because they don't read. Others might lie because they might feel stupid if they say no. I noticed on here I'm getting a decent amount of avid readers who are reading 50-150 books a year. The title of this captures those who read. Others who do not won't click on it. People who read tend to be with others who read as well. So even posting on reddit I'm not getting very good results. \n\nWho knows.",

I read a lot of non-fiction as well as I always have questions about the world and enjoy learning about a lot of topics. If that wasn't the case, I'd still be a reader, but my books would go from like 60 a year to 10 (that's about how many fiction books I likely read). My husband is not much of a reader, but he does read when he finds something he really likes, it's just not a high priority for him because his job involves a lot of learning and mental stimulation and so he likes his free time to be more chill. Reading isn't, I think, nearly so relaxing for him as it is for me.",

I like getting different perspectives in there. A lot of my political views changed because of books as well. \n\nI remember in your last comment you mentioned stuff about that I forgot to respond to it. I was more  of a Democrat back in the day. Big time socialist. I had some ideas challenged and they made a good point but I needed more info. At this point I never been challenged like that. So I started reading a bunch of books. Started studying economics heavily. I wanted the right answer badly because I was so passionate about my answers but they ended up being wrong so of course anyone would feel foolish. So reading books completely changed my mind. I went from a Democrat socialist to a Libertarian capitalist. All because I read books. I learned why things are the way they are. I also studied both sides so I can hear everyone out. You can't just hear only 1 side out. I made a complete 180 all because of books. \n\nI didn't mean to make that politically you mentioned politicians and I'm just saying how my life changed because of books. \n\nYou can teach yourself so many subjects just by renting books for free at the library or paying a low cost of maybe 10 dollars per book which can teach you so much.\n\nI bought a book because it was on sale in regards to memory. It teaches you many memory techniques. Changed the way I remember things. So much benefit for only 7.50.",

That's a little under 3 books per person. This is also for adults so you have to keep in mind some of these sales are going towards young people. Making this study look less favorable for adults since that brings us down to about 250-275 million. The avid readers in the small percent of the population are buying a chunk of these books.

Even my dad, who got me into reading and loves to read, didn\u2019t get to read for years do to his work schedule and things. Recently he\u2019s been able to get back into reading and I gave him one of my kindles so he can just use my library. Surprisingly enough, my mother actually read a book this year. She\u2019s never been a reader in my opinion. First book I remember her reading was the 50 shades when every woman was reading it.\n\nBesides that, I don\u2019t know hardly anyone who reads. Just for reference, I consider \u201creading a book\u201d to be reading a story from beginning to end and reading enough to comprehend it. That\u2019s not just fantasy or fiction. Biographies are stories as well. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d count skimming as reading either. Reference books are out to. None of those are bad. I just wouldn\u2019t look at one as say, \u201cI read a book.\u201d That\u2019s my personal perspective, though. I do think audio should count, as it still meets the criteria of going through a story and comprehending it.",

My sister in law reads though along with a couple cousins. That's about a 30-4 haha \n\nSince I started dating over 10yrs ago I never dated a woman who reads. The closest I came was 1 girl who said she used to for a few years and than stopped. \n\nSo when I hear this statistic it makes me question. Maybe it's a coincidence. I can admit that.

People who do read perhaps inflated their number. They could have done this in some upscale neighborhood perhaps in front of a book store.\n\n75 percent reading at least 1 book with a median of 4-5 is unbelievable.",

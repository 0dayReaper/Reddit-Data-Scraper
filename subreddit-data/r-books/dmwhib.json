If a mind is closed to analysis, contemplation and functional learning and study then no book will help.\n\nPerception is key to learning and is shaped by belief. The closed mind and strong unchecked belief go hand in hand.",

People should be educated about different ideas and beliefs then be able to discern what to think with proper guidance. People should also be taught how to exchange ideas and disagree respectfully with one another. If more people would practice proper discourse instead of shutting each other out we'll have a much more educated and civilized society.",

In short it was how to evaluate information and study more effectively.\n\nA couple of people have mentioned to me that they had studied it or that it's in their kids schools' curriculum, they were private schools. If it's introduced in a simplistic form earlier on I'd hope that people find adopting it later in life somewhat easy and familiar.  \n\"I think, therefore I am\" has become \"I think, therefore I am right\".",

I then grew a resentment for everything I \"learned\" in school and subsequently formed a completely opposite mindset than the one they were probably trying to indoctrinate me with.\n\nexamples: i was taught that the civil war was about \"states rights\". later i learned, yeah state's rights to slaves. i was forced to try typing with 4 fingers and got better at hunt-and peck out of spite. i don't even have to start about math. i haven't used anything higher than basic algebra since high school. the most damaging one though is probably how i had every holocaust/southern racism book shoved down my throat every single year. now while i'm aware of the events and their implications, i've become emotionally numb to the concepts and feel less sympathy for people who connect themselves with those events. i resent the holocaust and slavery not for their inherent monstrosities, but for their very existence as a thing people still talk about. i'm sick of it, and it makes me a more hateful person even if ideologically i agree with people's condemnation of them.",

There was a teacher in our department who had been teaching for 10 or so and absolutely refused to teach anything that had to do with race. She wouldn't even put these types of books on her shelf for students to read independently. \n\nI am very much of the opinion that books are supposed to teach children about the real world. When *The Hate U Give* and *All American Boys* came out, I had them available for my students to read. With students I knew were a little more \"sheltered,\" I would check in with them and discuss what was happening in the books...try to clarify or put it into context a little more for them.\n\nI actually bought a class set of *Ghost Boys* by Jewell Parker Rhodes to teach to my kids. We did a study of every \"ghost boy\" mentioned, starting with Emmett Till. Not a single parent called to complain about the content I was teaching. It is all about how you present the material to kids.\n\nContext: I am in west Texas. I taught at a Title 1 school that was about 70% white, 25% Hispanic, and 5% black. We had a really interesting mix of very wealthy and extremely poor students.",

As a teaching narrative on the reality of race, however, it is helplessly facile and ill-suited. It is a story told through the voice of a white child, Scout Finch, centred on the toils of her white father, Atticus Finch, and whose conflict rests on the judicial fate of a black man, Tom Robinson.\n\n&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird\u00a0was not only written in an immature voice, but poured out of a mind immaturely attuned to racialized people as human beings who continue to exist when white people aren\u2019t thinking about them. The story\u2019s cast of white characters \u2013 Scout\u2019s family, her neighbours, even the malevolent Ewells \u2013 are actualized and living people, each with their own motivations and desires. They, and the social realities of the 1930s South, are the novel\u2019s subject.\n\n&gt;Tom Robinson, on the other hand, is a cipher. A formless void into which the white imagination can project itself. We know hardly anything of his family\u2019s grief, or their rage at the unjust society into which they were violently displaced at birth. We read nothing of the nights his mother must have wrapped her hands around her empty womb and cried out to God to save her child. What we do know is his pitiful fate at the hands of a justice system engineered to destroy him.\n\n&gt;Tom Robinson, and the black community in the fictional town of Maycomb, are the novel\u2019s object.\n\n[Source](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-no-to-kill-a-mockingbird-shouldnt-be-taught-in-2018/)",

By doing so, it let white people whose opinions hadn\u2019t been formed yet get a chance to feel and empathize with a tender and noble *human* who also happened to be white and also defied the white status quo: Atticus Finch works for principles and relationships, not money or prestige. Especially when this book was released, the notion that a white Southern lawyer might work to do what was right rather what would make him obscenely rich was nearly as subversive as a white lawyer defending a black man. Yes the defendant is a cipher. But so most every stranger from an unfamiliar culture seems to everyone else. \n\nBy writing about what she thought white people should be doing From a white person\u2019s perspective, the author was very much staying in her lane.\n\nIf someone is misguided enough to think that \u201call books about race\u201d should have any particular race as the main character, they\u2019re part of the problem.",

Atticus is reluctant because he knows what it will mean for his family and his kids, but does it anyway because it is the right thing to do.  His reluctance is understandable, and his kids almost get killed because of him doing the right thing.\n\nOutside the jail he puts himself in harms way.  It seems as though the mob has the upper hand, but they never actually do.  Atticus asks them his trademark question of \"Do you really think so?\" after the mob tells him they've tricked the sheriff, and Scout runs into the middle of everything because she wants to see Atticus serve someone up a hot slice of humble pie.  Scout does her thing, kicks a guy in a dick, talks to Walter's dad, and saves the day.  However, Mr. Underwood then reveals that he was there with a shotgun up in a window the whole time.  It's not clear whether or not Atticus knows Underwood is up there, because Scout is a little kid and has no fucking idea what's actually going on.  That said, Atticus seeming calm and asking his trademark question that implies he has the upper hand, lets us infer that he still knew he had Underwood up in the sniper's nest.  Atticus only becomes incredibly frightened when his children show up.\n\nAll that said, the story is certainly about the pain of growing up and entering the real world.  It's a bit more optimistic than you're making it out to be, though.  The book is about how people need to have empathy, even though the world is complicated, and how we all need to work a bit harder to see the good in each other.  Unless you're a total scumbag like Bob Ewell.",

It was a very conservative place and I feel like it was probably the dosage of reality that crowd could handle without throwing a fit. That was quite a while ago now, however, and I think today we would expect and hope for more inclusive perspectives even in that very conservative town.  \nYour perspective definitely makes a lot of sense. Not that it's a \"bad book\" or anything, I just definitely think there could be more appropriate choices today.",

Every character in every story isn't owed an in-depth characterization - the elements of a story are put together to create a whole and make a point. \n\nLiterally the important point to the story is that TR is black. It doesn't matter what kind of person he is, or \"how many nights his mom held her womb\" - the point of the story is how white society treats black people - and for the that you need the character to be black. That's (mostly) it. Making TR honest and likeable reinforces the point.\n\nSorry, I know you presented the argument in a reasonable way so not trying to jump on you, but I feel like this is exactly the sort of drivel that the original article calls out - creating a landscape where characters are somehow \"owed\" a backstory is asinine and makes narrative impossible. Of course characters can be and often are symbols.",

Contemporary literary criticism often makes some truly asinine statements about the way narrative structures should work. \n\nTKAM is written from a fairly limited first person perspective. How could Scout possibly know anything about Tom outside of the court? They live in a highly stratified and segregated community. It\u2019s not like she\u2019d hang out at his house.\n\nBeyond that, would it really add to the story? It\u2019s supposed to be about a young child experiencing the wretched side of her idyllic town for the first time. It is not a story about the grief of Tom\u2019s family- that would be a different story. \n\nI hate the literary criticism that examines books by the metric of, \u201cWhat the critic thinks the author should have done.\u201d",

I don't tend to complain about Americanisation in the UK but having our English class reading lists stripped of our own writers for american race issues and communism scares was VERY strange in retrospect.\n\nI also can't help but feel that books like 1984, Brave New World, Catch 22, The Trial etc. are far more useful in how they reflect the time they were written and how their messaging has a much greater long-term relevance. They are all pretty uncomfortable too.",

I had an educational assistant who is black to explain why the book should not be censored.  Then I had to read the book, with the N-word, in front of said EA.

Certainly, most people would say the opposite of hot is \"cold\".\n\nAnd they'd be correct, if you only consider the the polar opposite of the term \"hot\".\n\nBy contrast, the logical opposite of hot is just \"not-hot\". The logical opposite of a term is where the conditions fail to satisfy the requirements to be the thing described.\n\nFor example, we could hypothetically define \"pizza\" to mean \"bread, sauce, and cheese\". If all you have is bread and cheese, then in this example it wouldn't meet the standard for being pizza. It would be \"not-pizza\".\n\nSame goes for temperature. \"Lukewarm\" is not hot. So are \"cool\" and \"room-temperature\" not hot. These temperatures fail to meet the definition of \"hot\"; so they're \"not hot\", which is in logical opposition to being considered \"hot\".\n\n**Who cares about this distinction?**\n\nThe discussion between the users, above, comes down to a mistaken assumption about what the other user is describing when they say \"comfortable\" and \"uncomfortable\".\n\nOne user has improperly assumed that \"not uncomfortable\" is the same as \"feeling a sense of comfort\", which is the polar opposite of being uncomfortable. So when the one user said they weren't uncomfortable, the other user interpreted that to mean the polar opposite and assumed the user was \"comfortable\".\n\nThat user failed to understand that, like temperature, there are other feelings one can have other than either comfort or discomfort.",

I was told by my father to read the book as he thought that it was important for the my formation of my worldview. I did not read it in class and perhaps this is the reason that we feel differently about it.  I should also say that I didn't read for pleasure very much as a kid, but it was by no means pushed on me. \n\nSomething about the book changed me; growing up in rural Canada, I didn't have a great deal of understanding of Jim Crow or the struggle for Civil Rights, but I did have a strong moral compass.  The novel open my eyes to injustice that I had no part in but it made me feel vivid emotions and I was hooked on the plot.\n\nIt was the first book that made me cry when I read it.  It was very accessible to a teen, and even younger.  It was also the first book I couldn't put down; the fact that plot was so engrossing to a 15 year old boy with nothing invested that he couldn't put it down says something.\n\nI think the biggest problem with this book is that it is taught poorly in general.  Just about everyone who read this because it was course compulsory shares your sentiment.  The book was important in the time that it was written, but let's be honest; its sunject matter it still very important.",

What makes To Kill a Mockingbird so special in this respect?",

While these books may be able to lend a hand with this topics, I believe that they would be better received once the dust has settled for these young minds just a bit.  It is hard to take a lesson when you are in the thick of your own troubles.\n\nI also think that the goal should really be to create lifelong readers and learners.  These books are, in my opinion, just too heavy for many young people to read at that age - likely the very same kids who could benefit from them the absolute most in just a few more years.\n\nI think these books are valuable, but would love to see books that inspire a love for reading by appealing to their audience until it has become a habit.",

The teacher did explain it in and out though because English teachers love to deep dive books and over explain them. In this instance though my teacher did a great job fully explaining racial tensions during this time period and how unfair the system was to blacks. I guess if you are sheltered to this sort of struggle then yeah this book is uncomfortable, but for people who grew up poor in multicultural neighborhoods you knew that \"the system\" was unfair and none of the themes in to kill a mockingbird were shocking.",

I don\u2019t annotate them, unless it\u2019s something I\u2019m studying, but I bring the book I\u2019m reading everywhere with me and it looks \u201cused\u201d once I\u2019m done. I still take care of them , I don\u2019t let them get wet, dirty, I don\u2019t bend the cover but I love the look of used books, it means they are loved and they were lived. If it\u2019s something I have to study (I study literature) I do annotate it heavily because this is the best method for me to understand it and I still love the finished looks.\n\nI\u2019ve never met someone like me, everyone I met is disgusted by the way I treat book, many people I know don\u2019t even annotate textbook but leave them immaculate. It\u2019s like they think it\u2019s a sin, but in my opinion books are \u201cthings\u201d, things are made to be used and it\u2019s nice if you can se the passing of time on them, of course given that you take care of them and use them for what they are meant to be used.",

I'll also write down the page number, of passages I've marked, on one of the blank or otherwise mostly blank pages early on in the book. \n\nUsually on readings after my first I'll mark passages that give details on the characters e.g. Gandalf has eyebrows that poke out past his hat. On subsequent readings I'll use a different color pen just to know what I gained from each reading. \n\nWhen it comes to precious books, first editions and leatherback copies, I don't dare write in them. The only exception is if it's a recently released first edition, and then I'll buy two copies: one to mark up and another to leave alone.

I read by peaking to avoid it.\n\nThen a friend of mine told me it feels betrer to let go and let books be books, that they want to be /used/ (similar to what you\u2019re saying). And ever since then, I don\u2019t care about breaking the spine anymore. I enjoy reading now more than before.",

I also make sure they don't get damaged,  but I highlight, write, tab, crack spines and fold corners of pages down. the only books I'm extremely careful with are vintage books as they're kinda fragile.\nI guess it depends on what everyone's going for with their collection.",

I don\u2019t trust a lot of people with my books, I\u2019m always worry they would let food spill over them, toss them around or stuff like that",

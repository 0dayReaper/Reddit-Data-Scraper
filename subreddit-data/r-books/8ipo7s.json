            "comment": "These kind of firsthand accounts are incredibly important and the preservation of vernacular offers a lot of insight into the lives of these individuals. Sometimes I think about how recent so much of American history is. A *slave ship* survivor told his story in the 20th century, *after* World War I, during the Great Depression. This man lived through two of the biggest wars America has been involved in, the Civil War and World War I, and told a personal account of being transported from Africa to be sold as a slave in the South. \n\nI think there's often a disconnect when it comes to these periods of history, like we just jumped into the 20th century, but other people were most certainly alive to see both periods.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe very sorry to be parted from one \u2019nother,\u201d Lewis told Hurston. \u201cWe seventy days cross de water from de Affica soil, and now dey part us from one \u2019nother. Derefore we cry. Our grief so heavy look lak we cain stand it. I think maybe I die in my sleep when I dream about my mama.\u201d\n\n&gt;Lewis also describes what it was like to arrive on a plantation where no one spoke his language, and could explain to him where he was or what was going on. \u201cWe doan know why we be bring \u2019way from our country to work lak dis,\u201d he told Hurston. \u201cEverybody lookee at us strange. We want to talk wid de udder colored folkses but dey doan know whut we say.\u201d\n\n&gt;As for the Civil War, Lewis said he wasn\u2019t aware of it when it first started. But part-way through, he began to hear that the North had started a war to free enslaved people like him. A few days after Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered in April 1865, Lewis says that a group of Union soldiers stopped by a boat on which he and other enslaved people were working and told them they were free.\n\n&gt;Lewis expected to receive compensation for being kidnapped and forced into slavery, and was angry to discover that emancipation didn\u2019t come with the promise of \u201cforty acres and a mule,\u201d or any other kind of reparations. Frustrated by the refusal of the government to provide him with land to live on after stealing him away from his homeland, he and a group of 31 other freepeople saved up money to buy land near the state capital of Mobile, which they called Africatown.\n\nEdit: More excerpts from the interview in this Vulture article, courtesy of /u/lee61.\n\nhttp://www.vulture.com/2018/04/zora-neale-hurston-barracoon-excerpt.html\n\nThe interviews were conducted over three months with a man named Cudjo Lewis, or Kossula, his original name, the last survivor of the last slave ship to land on American shores.

But Johnson defanged the Freedmen's Bureau and hastily scuttled Sherman's \"40 acres and a mule\" act, and returned much of the Southern lands to Southerners, regardless of their loyalty. \n\nThere's a very telling quote by a Confederate general used in the Ken Burns Civil War series: \"The emancipated slaves own nothing because nothing but freedom has been given to them.\" ",

He lived his whole life in what was at that time a very archaic ideology. He was considered old fashioned in the 30's and onward to his death in 96'. Your initial comment about how we see time in clear-cut eras reminded me of the fact that he had older parents and they were old fashioned for their time. These minor details prevail amongst individuals but to make connections like \" the civil war and world war one are only ~50 years apart \" are significant. People born at seemingly insignificant dates during strange parts of history may have seen some things that are mind blowing to us who may feel as far removed from 1900 as we do from 1600.

Alice Walker rediscovered ZNH in the 1970\u2019s, and she got much more popular in the following years. All I meant by this was that she was virtually unknown for decades, and because I didn\u2019t learn about her until college, I was unaware she was required reading in the years following the Walker thing. I had two separate thoughts that I fused into one. Walker rediscovered her, then she became famous, the reason I called her overlooked was because for a very very long time, she was.",

He never went back home, or spoke much of his family, except for his mother's funeral. He also, according to my mother, was pretty loudly racist - we now think that was a tactic to cover his heritage.",

I am half-Mexican but white-passing and often I feel like I am never seen or recognized as part of a heritage that I am strongly attached to. My entire life I have had white people and brown people argue with me (as if I don't know who I am) about having a connection to Mexican culture. I often feel alienated from any group, with the exception of other white-passing POC (of whom there are very few). It didn't help that I only speak a little bit of Spanish. But anyway, I guess the takeaway is to make sure that she feels strongly connected to her roots and that you back her up in that connection. She should have a safe haven from the ridicule and confusion that is bound to come up. This is a strange liminal space of racism/colorism that is very stubborn. ",

I totally understand a company wanting to protect its most famous symbol... but at the expense of all this other work being unpublishable? What are they gonna do in 2042? Extend it again even further? \n\nPart of it is due to current copyright holders (estates or heirs) either not caring to publish or actively not publishing on purpose, so the blame doesn't lie entirely with Disney, but also with those people who 'own' works by important literary figures but refuse to publish it. \n\nThere's gotta be some change. Maybe copyright resides with the heirs or estate for 50 years after the death of the original creator for any work that is previously unpublished. After the 50 years, if it's been unpublished (and obvs if it's known to exist) then it's public domain. Perhaps for previously published things, if it's been out of print for 50+ years, and the original creator is gone, then it's also public domain. Maybe the estate or heirs can be given first chance at publishing and thus profiting, but if they refuse to do so then it goes to public domain. \n\nSo if a new piece of work by an author (dead for &gt;50 yr) is discovered, the estate will have first crack at publishing, but if they decline, then it's published in public domain, or a similar system. Copyright of previously published works can remain with the copyright holder, regardless of time elapsed since author's death, as long as they keep the print/edition dates within 50 years.\n\nI really want to support copyright remaining with the original creators, but if they just hold onto works and never do anything with them, I feel like there should be a responsibility to share those works.",

My grandfather could afford that because he had some land that he could rely on in case of unexpected hardship. It allowed him to take risks he otherwise couldn't have taken.

That property was his father's plantation which was built by slaves, maintained by slaves, and paid off using the profits stolen from slaves through their unpaid labor.\n\nThere is a bold line connecting my middle class lifestyle with the economy of slavery a century and a half ago.

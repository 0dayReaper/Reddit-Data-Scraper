I think they will understand as this is something they anticipate and won\u2019t make you feel like a criminal or anything for it OP so try not to feel anxious. If you don\u2019t have the money now just keep it on loan till you\u2019ve put some money aside. \u263a\ufe0f",

Honesty goes a long way when dealing with these cases. Depending on the damage it is possible that the book will be charged but it is also possible that it won't. Don't worry about them being angry at you, it's something that happens fairly regularly.\n\nRepair-wise though, using tape was the wrong call. In the library, we have a special tape that we use to repair cuts and the like, it's mostly transparent. Should it happen again, just the book as is and they will handle the repair.\n\nTake care!",

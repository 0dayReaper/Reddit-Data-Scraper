    "postText": "I've not finished this one yet, but I have to say, as someone who studied forensic psychology and still reads plenty of true crime and serial killer books, this is one of the most horrifying books I have ever read. Second only to The Road Out of Hell: Sanford Clark and the True Story of the Wineville Murders. \n\nI never really believed that orphanages anywhere were great institutions, if only because I know how humans treated other humans and how terrible documentation of events involving the less fortunate were in our past. But this is a whole other level of horrific. I have a very hard time with organized religion, and Catholicism is right up there at the top of my list. This is most definitely not a book that makes me see them in any kind of better light.\n\nKnowing how the Catholic religion has been throughout their history, the terrible things they have done and continue to do, did not prepare me for stories of children under 10 witnessing the murder of other children and then being beaten or locked into small cabinets and closets for days without food or water as punishment for simply having been present during the event. Children being coerced into helping dispose of the bodies of children and then being told to keep their mouths shut or the same would happen to them. Children waking up in the morning to see a nun yank a child out of bed while verbally assaulting them, only to find that when they tried to stand the child up, they had been dead for hours. \n\nI can definitively say that this book may haunt my thoughts for years after I finish it. But I can also say that I will finish it, because turning away from the horror never solves anything and the terrible things in life need to be known, the victims and perpetrators need to be named and remembered, else how do we continue to evolve as a species?",

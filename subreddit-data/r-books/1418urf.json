    "postText": "Here are what I learned from a book called \"The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work\" by Shawn Achor.\n\n\\- When we are positive, we make a success like doing well on an exam.\n\n\\- Shawn\u2019s to-do list for us\n\n\\- Meditate: \u201cNeuroscientists have found that monks who spend years meditating actually grow their left prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain most responsible for feeling happy.\u201d\n\n\\- Find Something to Look Forward To: \u201cOne study found that people who just thought about watching their favorite movie actually raised their endorphin levels by 27 percent.\u201d\n\n\\- Commit Conscious Acts of Kindness: A long line of empirical research, including one study of over 2,000 people, has shown that acts of altruism\u2014giving to friends and strangers alike\u2014decrease stress and strongly contribute to enhanced mental health.\n\n\\- Making time to go outside on a nice day: \u201cOne study found that spending 20 minutes outside in good weather not only boosted positive mood but broadened thinking and improved working memory.\u201d\n\n\\- Try watching less TV: \u201cStudies have shown that the less negative TV we watch, specifically violent media, the happier we are.\u201d\n\n\\- For those who worry about not knowing life\u2019s risks: \u201cPsychologists have found that people who watch less TV are actually more accurate judges of life\u2019s risks and rewards than those who subject themselves to the tales of crime, tragedy, and death that appear night after night on the ten o\u2019clock news.\u201d\n\n\\- Move: \u201cThree groups of depressed patients were assigned to different coping strategies\u2014one group took antidepressant medication, one group exercised for 45 minutes three times a week, and one group did a combination of both.33 After four months, all three groups experienced similar improvements in happiness. The very fact that exercise proved just as helpful as anti-depressants is remarkable, but the story doesn\u2019t end here. The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate. Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent! In short, physical activity is not just an incredibly powerful mood lifter, but a long-lasting one. Walk, bike, run, play, stretch, jump rope, pogo stick\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter as long as you get moving.\u201d\n\n\\- Spend Money (but Not on Stuff): \u201cSpending money on other people, called \u201cprosocial spending,\u201d also boosts happiness.\u201d\n\n\\- Use a Signature Strength: \u201cWhen 577 volunteers were encouraged to pick one of their signature strengths and use it in a new way each day for a week, they became significantly happier and less depressed than control groups.\u201d\n\n\\- Where to find the Signature Strength:\u00a0[https://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/](https://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/)\n\n\\- Align our tasks with our personal vision to see work as a calling.\n\n\\- What is the purpose of this task?\n\n\\- What will it accomplish?\n\n\\- What does this result lead to?\n\n\\- Believe in others\u2019 potential: the Pygmalion Effect: when our belief in another person\u2019s potential brings that potential to life.\n\n\\- Be optimistic: \u201cStudies have shown that optimists set more goals (and more difficult goals) than pessimists, and put more effort into attaining those goals, stay more engaged in the face of difficulty, and rise above obstacles more easily.12 Optimists also cope better in high-stress situations and are better able to maintain high levels of well-being during times of hardship.\u201d\n\n\\- Believe that you are a lucky person: \u201cA researcher asked volunteers to read through a newspaper and count how many photos were in it. The people who claimed to be lucky took mere seconds to accomplish this task, while the unlucky ones took an average of two minutes.\u201d\n\n\\- Write down three good things each day: \u201cOne study found that participants who wrote down three good things each day for a week were happier and less depressed at the one-month, three-month, and six-month follow-ups.\u201d\n\n\\- Make mistakes to grow more!: \u201cThe earlier we face difficulties and drawbacks, the better prepared we are to deal with the inevitable obstacles along our path\u201d\n\n\\- Explain your past events positively: \u201cPeople with an optimistic explanatory style interpret adversity as being local and temporary (i.e., \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad, and it will get better.\u201d). They automatically imagine alternative scenarios that make them feel fortunate, interpret setbacks as short-lived and small in scope, and see inherent opportunity where others only see foreboding while those with a pessimistic explanatory style see these events as more global and permanent (i.e., \u201cIt\u2019s really bad, and it\u2019s never going to change.\u201d) In the world of sports, studies of athletes ranging from collegiate swimmers to professional baseball players show that explanatory style predicts athletic performance.\u201d\n\n\\- Set reasonable expectations for yourself and make small success:\n\n\\- Harvard Business School professor Peter Bregman \u201cDon\u2019t write a book, write a page.\u2026 Don\u2019t expect to be a great manager in your first six months, just try to set expectations well.\u201d\n\n\\- \u201cSmall successes can add up to major achievements.\u201d\n\n\\- Make good habits: \u201cHabits are like financial capital\u2014forming one today is an investment that will automatically give out returns for years to come.\u201d\n\n\\- Passive leisure, like watching TV and trolling around on Facebook, might be easier and more convenient but doesn\u2019t provide the same rewards as Active leisure like hobbies, games, and sports. Studies have found that American teenagers are two and half times more likely to experience elevated enjoyment when engaged in a hobby than when watching TV, and three times more likely when playing a sport.\n\n\\- 20-Second Rule: Preparation for a good habit should be 20 seconds to lower resistance.\n\n\\- Form good relationships: \u201cResearchers have found that social support has as much effect on life expectancy as smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, and regular physical activity.\u201d \u201cStudies have found that people with strong relationships are less likely to perceive situations as stressful in the first place.\u201d\n\n\\- Our external circumstances predict only about 10 percent of our total happiness. It means whatever your job is, you can be happy.\n\n\\- Belief shapes our perception: \u201cOne study found that two people can look at the same picture of a friend and see two completely different expressions on that friend\u2019s face.\u201d\n\n\\- Don\u2019t worry!: \u201cAfter an initial adjustment and period of hardship, most victims of paralysis bounce back to just about the same level of happiness they experienced before.\u201d\n\n\\- \u201cOnline advertisers now conduct market research with sophisticated eye-tracking machines, determined to develop the perfect place for a banner ad on a website.\u201d\n\nLet's discuss it!",

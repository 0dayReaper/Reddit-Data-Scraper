Just because I haven't seen it doesn't mean it hasn't happened or isn't happening right now. People who work in those environments know the risk of being in a remote location and or worked REALLY hard to get those positions, so they won't jeapordize their image (I'm talking about scientists / researchers... can't say the same for everyone)\n\nPeople tend to drink in moderation, usually during festivities or social gatherings (Saturday night bonfires, movie night, 4th of July, etc.)",

Two guys with no prior experience trying to survive in the wilderness sort of thing. When you're stuck with one person for extended periods of time without time to yourself, combined with fatigue, hunger and pain from blisters and whatnot you get a very \"reactive\" environment. I started getting very irritated by seemingly trivial things and it just continued to build up.\n\nTotally irrational reaction and over stupid small things like I didn't like the way he packed the tent, walked too fast or too slow and stuff like that. I'm not a violent guy and I've never thrown a punch in my life, but after about a week I straight up told him I had the urge to punch him in the face when we had a small argument over something trivial. He told me he had similar thoughts. Talked it out and was very intrigued by the whole phenomenon. I wouldn't have acted out on it there and then, but another week and I'm honestly not so sure. After talking about it we became much more aware of it and it wasn't a problem for the rest of the time. Basically laughed about it for the last week and jokingly teased each other.\n\nI can only imagine what could potentially happen over months and years, especially if you don't get along. Scary stuff and something you need to be aware of in long-term confined situations for sure.",

That way, access to settlement is much more readily available \u2026 and we can figure out details. Again - like the starship the challenge is \"ecopoiesis\" how do we make sure there is air, water and fertile earth which can help build capacity for thriving \u2026 \"business\" is much further afield. Although we have many outposts in Antarctica none of them are actually cities \u2026 If we can organise those resources somehow, we start moving from some very big unknowns, and start responding to these challenges with things we can work with, improve upon and even reinvent.\n\nRachel Armstrong, Professor of Experimental Architecture at Newcastle University, UK, examining the cultural conditions needed to construct a living habitat within a spaceship during her AMA:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5cpza0/bbcfuture_ama_im_rachel_armstrong_professor_of/d9yv375/",

The drill instructors got wind of this  and made a guy tell everyone the ending so people would stop wasting time. The dude told everyone a dramatic intense story of what happens and who dies and why. Everyone was so pissed, I was pissed because I wanted to read it after basic. \n\nOnce I did read it, it turned out the dramatic story the guy told was an on the spot fabrication. The smug look on the instructors face after everyone looked broken was vindicated by this guys subtle turning of the tables. A hero.",

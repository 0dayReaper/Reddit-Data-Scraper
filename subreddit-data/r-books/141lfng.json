    "postText": "Not sure if anyone will care about this at all, but I wanted to briefly revisit and think about all the books I've read in the first half of this year, and just thought I'd make a post with a rating and a sentence about each.  If anyone is interested in them or wants more details feel free to ask.  I'd love to have a discussion with some people about any they've read.  I don't have many people to talk to about most of them.\n\n**The Power of the Dog &amp; The Cartel** (Don Winslow, Books 1 &amp; 2 of The Cartel Trilogy) - 8/10 &amp; 7.5/10 - gripping, violent, epic storytelling similar to Narcos on Netflix.  Engaging storyline and memorable characters, except...\n\n**The Border** (Don Winslow, Cartel #3) - 4/10 - The only DNF on this list and one of the few DNF's of my life.  Just terrible. Shocking drop in quality.\n\n**A Town Like Alice** (Nevil Shute) 10/10 - Instantly one of my favorite books ever.  Shute has quickly become one of my favorite authors.\n\n**All You Need Is Kill** (Hiroshi Sakurazaka) 6/10 - Mostly grabbed this bc I love the title and liked the Tom Cruise movie.  Quick read, action heavy, I found it less engaging than the movie, to be frank.  Didn't really like the main character.\n\n**Homegoing** (Yaa Gyasi) - 8/10 - Very powerful, generational storytelling.  Has really stuck with me.  Has a really unique structure, that works both for and against it at times.  Really memorable book.\n\n**The Fall of the House of Usher** (Poe) - 4/10 - Short story, wanted to try a \"classic.\"  Didn't get it.  Basically put me to sleep.\n\n**On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous** (Ocean Vuong) - 7.5/10 - Unique little memoir from a wonderful poet. I liked it, but it's also a bit too heavy on the poetry for me.  It's very beautiful, but also becomes a bit exhausting.  I'm more of a plot guy so all the flowery passages were challenging at times.\n\n**Small Things Like These** (Claire Keegan) - 9/10 - Powerful, moving novella about a day in the life of a simple, introspective man and how he comes to confront the local Parrish.  At 100ish pages it certainly doesn't overstay its welcome, and there's just something very calming and reflective about her writing.  \n\n**10 Minutes &amp; 38 Seconds in This Strange World** (Elif Shafak) - 7/10 - Lovely story about the enduring power of friendship and found family, even in the worst circumstances.  Maybe not as impactful or memorable as I'd hoped, but it's a good story with a good message.\n\n**Remarkably Bright Creatures** (Shelby Van Pelt) - 6/10 - Read this for a book club at a new job.  Not my cup of tea, but not terrible or anything.  Very pedestrian writing and relies on some INSANE contrivances, but has that sort of popular quality where you can easily picture the movie they'll make.  It's easy and fine.\n\n**Things Fall Apart** (Chinua Achebe) 8/10 -  A pillar of African literature, I thought I should give it a try.  Great story about family and community and the ebbs and flows of society/progress.  Ultimately quite depressing, but powerful.\n\n**The Day of the Jackal** (Frederick Forsyth) - 8/10 - Old school spy/action triller.  Wanted to read something smart and exciting and was not disappointed.  Great story with tight plotting, memorable characters, and a strong ending.  Would make a great 8 episode period miniseries if done faithfully.\n\n**The Song of Achilles** (Madeline Miller) - 8.5/10 - Seems slightly divisive  on this sub, but I really enjoyed this.  I love Miller's writing and the way she blends the real and the mythic.  Thought this was a beautiful retelling of a classic tale.\n\n**The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo** (Taylor Jenkins Reid) - 7.5/10 - Another book where it's obvious why it's so popular, but much better than Remarkably Bright Creatures.  By the end I had grown to care about Evelyn and appreciated the book.  Not sure if I will read more Reid, but I'm open to it.\n\n**The Hellbound Heart** (Clive Barker) 7/10 - Have always been intrigued by the Hellraiser lore, so thought I'd read it.  Very short, fun read.  Pretty fucked up.  Not what I expected, honestly, but a lot of twisted fun.\n\n**The Overstory** (Richard Powers) 6.5/10 - Pretty letdown by this one, honestly.  Kept feeling like it was building to something epic, a la The Stand, but it just never happened.  The structure made no sense to me, and the characters were frustrating.  Way too long and overwrought to justify itself, imo.  Had to use a dictionary for about 800 different ways to say \"green\" or \"foliage.\"  Felt pretentious.\n\n**On The Beach** (Nevil Shute) - 10/10 - Another banger from Shute.  This has one of the most depressing, memorable premises for a book.  Don't really want to spoil anything, but it's very opposite to the feeling of A Town Like Alice, but no less effective.  I love this guys simple, workmanlike writing.  Such memorable characters.\n\n**Maus: A Survivors Tale** (Art Spiegelman) 9/10 - Only graphic novel I've fit in this year.  Powerful stuff.  As humerous as it is gut wrenching at times.  Gives a powerful first-hand perspective on surviving the extermination camps of WW2.  Fuck right-wing nutjobs who want to ban this from schools.  Sickening.\n\n**The Count of Monte Cristo** (Alexandre Dumas) 9.5/10 - The longest and oldest book I've read, and an absolute banger.  If you've only seen the movie...you don't know the story.  I read the full unabridged version, which was excellent, but I wouldn't fault anyone for reading an abridged version.  It's very flowery and sometimes repetitive.  But there's a reason it's still popular nearly 300 years later.  Wait.  Hope.  \n\n**No Longer Human** (Osamu Dazai) - 7.5/10 - Shockingly depressing memoir, or pseudo-memoir (?).  Foundational Japanese literature.  Just a brutal story of a man who feels disconnected from humanity.  It's worth the short read if you're into existential depression.\n\n**If We Were Villains** (M.L. Rio) 5.5/10 - I enjoyed the setting and characters, but ultimately a big miss for me storytelling-wise.  Fairly bland writing.  Didn't add up in any satisfying way.  Main character is a moron.  I figured out the \"mystery\" pretty much immediately and was extremely disappointed to find out I was right.  Bleh.\n\n**Trust** (Hernan Diaz) 7.5/10 - I enjoyed this Pullitzer winner more than Overstory, but it still leaves me a bit cold.  I think maybe Pullitzers focus on structure and language more than I prefer.  More of a puzzlebox than a real novel.  Four \"books\" couched inside the book, and you can draw your own conclusions.  It's a great idea and has stuck with me, but it also kept me feeling very distanced and stuck in my own head.\n\n**The Breaking Wave** (Nevil Shute) 9.5/10 - WW2 story set in Australia about a wounded vet returning home and unraveling a big of a domestic mystery.  More excellent writing and memorable characters from Shute.  Absolutely heartbreaking story about the long-term effects of war.  Heartbreaking.  This guy gets it.\n\n**Circe** (Madeline Miller) 8/10 - Another cool take on Greek myth from Miller.  I enjoyed it a lot, but probably slightly less than Achilles.  Hoping she releases another book soon.\n\n**This Place of Wonder** (Barbara O'Neil) 6.5/10 - Decent, sort of middle-of-the-road book.  Focuses on four women dealing with the fallout of the most important man in their life (father, ex-husband, lover), and the circumstances of his sudden death.  It's good enough, one of those very \"California\" feeling stories.  Not a huge fan of her writing, but the story was good enough.",

I mostly avoid sci-fi and fantasy, but that's not a rule. All I want is a good, grounded, human story.  My favorite books ever are Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet.  If it's not one of the \"big ones\" that I already knew about (Monte Cristo, Things Fall Apart, Day of the Jackal), I guess it mostly starts with things Goodreads suggests or that I find myself.  Doesn't hurt to have a great title and/or cover art (that's how I found The Overstory). Or I just pick up something interesting at a bookstore (No Longer Human just caught my eye randomly) Or stuff I see on this sub.",

I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have understood it at 12.

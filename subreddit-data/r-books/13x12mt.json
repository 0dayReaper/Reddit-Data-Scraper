    "postText": "I decided to have another read through this contrnder for the great American novel because I know that Hollywood is making another attempt at a film adaptation, with McCarthy serving as a producer and John Hillcoat directing.\n\nHonestly, I loved the book for its rawness, atmosphere and its brutal look into the human condition in the old west, even though it is still a savage enough story with the extreme violence, genocide racism and other nasty themes. For me, those are aspects that make it all the more emotionally compelling considering its setting and characters, though it is also why there were at least three previous attempts at a film adaptation that caused producers to chicken out and abort a film because those themes got way too real for them.\n\nAnyway, if they stick to it this time then I will be pretty excited to see a film adaptation made but I was wondering if anyone else wanted to share their thoughts on the book's merits?",

I enjoyed other books of his more but this is his masterpiece.  My second read got rid of a lot of the disorientation and further reads will reveal even more layers, that\u2019s always something I think the greatest novels share.",

It's not like he's describing wounds in visceral detail again and again. There is violence frequently, yes, but it's generally glossed over like just another part of the terrain. Which is the point. \n\nAnd that's a quality that pervades everything about the book: total unity and harmony of the story, the language, the presentation, and even the author himself and his remote inaccessibility. It's like a book out of an alternate timeline where novelists shut themselves away for 15 years making highly researched and aesthetically uncompromising historical fiction that perfectly expresses a part of their soul and then somehow strike massive success with it. It's the secret dream of many authors and people who never became authors. I doubt anything quite like it will be produced again in our culture as many of the conditions that led to its creation no longer exist. \n\nAs for the film, I certainly wish them luck. Many have called it unfilmable, but I think it will be extremely filmable. McCarthy writes like a camera.",

I truly think that would be impossible nowadays. I also seriously doubt the willingness of the publishing industry to put material like this into the culture we have today unless coming from an already-bestselling author, which at the time McCarthy was not; this book would not have survived sensitivity readings intact, which fortunately at the time did not exist. Finally I think the economics of living on shoestring budgets while you work on your novel for decades will only become less and less feasible with time as cost of living increases across all categories and never declines",

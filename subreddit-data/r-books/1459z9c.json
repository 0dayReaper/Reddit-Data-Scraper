    "postText": "Wow. Absolutely devastating and beautiful. Thick with character development and dilemma. This was one of the few novels of Steinbeck\u2019s I hadn\u2019t read yet. I\u2019m a huge fan of his as I feel often times he is writing directly to me, almost for me. \nThe Winter of Our Discontent struck so close to home with me it was scary. I see much of myself in Ethan Allen Hawley. The evolution of my identity and manhood rife with self-deprecation, questioning, uncertainty, but unwavering in my love for my family despite our many shortcomings. I also saw much of my own kids in his, Ellen and Allen. Spirited and sassy. Tender and stubborn. What a wonderfully crafted story this was. \nIf you are a fan of Steinbeck\u2019s and haven\u2019t read this one, I highly recommend you do. I wish I could go back in time and read it for the first time.",

            "comment": "Steinbeck often wrote his novels as if they were for his sons (particularly with East of Eden) so we always have the feeling he\u2019s written something for someone when we read his books and I guess it feels so much more personal because it isn\u2019t an author writing to a faceless/nameless audience - it\u2019s an author writing to his sons, and through them to us.",

            "comment": "I recently read it, too. From a historical perspective it fits as a book emblematic of the 1950s; Steinbeck was critical of the new post-war age of consumerism and get-aheadism, and with a sense of a lost past (but without succumbing to conservatism/reaction)\n\nEthan was a great character. A guy who has emerged from a family and town with a great history, but who has petered along in mediocrity without any sense of what to do or where to go. Everyone around him wants to be rich and famous and to have fancy things, and he gets swept away by it all and abandons his values to get ahead",

Ironically I didn\u2019t particularly enjoy either of those when I first read them. Maybe bc I wasn\u2019t being forced to this time. Anyway from there I was inspired his other novels and I hope you will too. I think you would like the Pearl for example.",

According to the back it was last checked out 2 years before I was born. It was a first edition second printing hard cover copy! \n\nI started it many times over the years since then, never finishing it until now - more than 10 years later. \n\nI think just being older helped me to finish the book. In many ways I can relate to Ethan. \n\nAlso the dialogue is my absolute favorite - I love conversations between the family, especially Ethan and Mary.",

    "postText": "Meditations by Marcus Aurelius and The Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi. If you're going through a difficult time, these books might be for you. I'll break down each one briefly without spoiling and then share a bit about myself.\n\nMeditations: This book is a philosophical read at its core. The author was a Roman Emperor, and this is his personal journal. Marcus Aurelius can be described as a philosopher king. One who doesn't care much for the politics of the state, but he does his duty all the same. This book focuses on how Marcus Aurelius rationalized and processed each day with its unique challenges. This ultimately led him to a more fulfilling life. In short, gratitude and rationalizing difficulties.\n\nThe Book of Five Rings: This book focuses on a legendary Japanese swordsman as he breaks down his Way of the Warrior. It should be noted that this book should be read while practicing a martial art, but it is not wholly applicable. In truth, the book serves more as a guide for pursuing your goals and purpose. Each day you must hone your skill, and that's true for a martial artist or a carpenter.\n\nAbout me: I lost four people in 2022 that sent me in a death spiral of depression and nihilism. Each death came about every other month. It was horrific. I couldn't cope. I started doing drugs, lying to my (now ex) girlfriend, simply just giving up on existing. Not really living but hoping I would die soon. I made a lot of mistakes. But without this death and agony, I would not be here today as the best version of myself from the trauma. If you're struggling, and you look to literature for help like me, please check out these two books. Go into a martial art or really pursue an artistic passion. Journal daily. Etc. I wanted to share my story. And I'm curious how these books have changed your life too. I wish the best for you!",

I hope to keep working at temperance, moderation, prudence, decorum and self-control rather than letting situations get the better of whatever is the best parts of me.\n\nA few quotes that I find guiding posts for me, by the incomparable Marcus Aurelius:\n\n&gt;Shame on the soul, to falter on the road of life while the body still perseveres.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Often injustice lies in what you aren't doing, not only in what you are doing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Whenever you suffer pain, keep in mind that it's nothing to be ashamed of and that it can't degrade your guiding intelligence, nor keep it from acting rationally and for the common good...Remember too that many common annoyances are pain in disguise, such as sleepiness, fever and loss of appetite. When they start to get you down, tell yourself you are giving in to pain.\n\nAnd to think it was unlikely he would ever have decided to publish the collection of writings known as 'Meditations' for mankind's benefit.",

It's just not a choice, you can't be tripping off your head with fever and think straight, let alone decide to overcome it, it's just an obvious fact. \n\nI'm firmly of the opinion that CBT is frequently abusive, so.\n\nPolitical philosophy is explicitly an area of philosophy (it already is categorised by political views) and philosophers can have strong political views beyond that which are apparent in their work. It's not an 'apolitical' field, and it would be weird, say, to try to read Camus' La peste while trying not to notice the context of his WWII experiences (without which, even without it being referred to explicitly, some of it makes essentially no sense). Sartre's Le mort dans l'\u00e2me is outright set during WWII and includes discussion of communist views, among others.",

CBT and DBT are frequently used in attempts make the therapy process as \"rationalizable\" (meaning, someone with no skills or even a computer program could do it) as possible, regardless of what the client wants. DBT, especially, is used in hospital settings as a way to provide \"therapy\" that doesn't address underlying life circumstances but instead requires the \"client\" to self-monitor for bad thoughts in a way that can feel quite victim-blamey, plus it's connected to the \"borderline\" diagnosis which is an extremely degrading label to get slapped on you (basically the new \"hysteria\"). I wouldn't say it's any more abusive than other types of therapy, in fact in some ways it has less potential for abuse because it's shorter term and creates less of a bond between the client and therapist, but its overhyping as a miracle tool combined with the mental health system's overall tendency to blame the treat-ee whenever the treatment doesn't work, is a problem. \n\nThen of course there is the OTHER kind of CBT, which is *always* abusive...but sometimes guys like it \ud83d\ude1c",

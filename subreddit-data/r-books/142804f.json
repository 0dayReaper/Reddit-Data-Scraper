    "postText": "When I was young used to read quite a bit and I remember enjoying it alot I used to read this book series called \u201c39 clues\u201d \n\nAnyway haven\u2019t read books in like 6 years or so, but a friend recently recommended the book series Wild cards by George RR Martin and gave me a book in the series so I felt inclined to get the first book and start reading it \n\nI\u2019m midway through the first chapter and I feel like my brain just isn\u2019t absorbing a good portion of what I\u2019m reading, and I\u2019m just getting small idea of everything I read and what\u2019s going on in the book. \n\nIs it just this certain book or am I dumb or something? (Asking anybody whose read this book before) I really want to enjoy it and I thought the prologue was cool and intriguing but I just get lost in the words and scene changes sometimes. \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating and makes me lose motivation to keep read",

It's him. \n\nAlso, I think many of us have had that same feeling at the beginning of a book, when everything is unfamiliar and a lot of names and places and relationships are being thrown at us all at once, sometimes without all the context we need. Once you get through those introductory chapters, it usually starts to get easier to wrap your head around the story and keep everything sorted. And if you really aren't into it, just move on to a different author in the sci-fi or fantasy genres whose style you might like better. You won't have any trouble finding recommendations here. Enjoy!",

I'm not familiar with the series you are referring to, but R.R. Martin seems to be a fantasy writer, so that's why I'm making that comment. \n\nI need to be in the right mood and have no chaos going on in my life to start a fantasy book. I like to read series so once I understand the world it takes place in I can use that info for several books.",

I loved reading Edgar Allen Poe as a young adult and recently picked up a book of his short stories, beginning with **The Fall of the House of Usher**.  I struggled a bit with many of the passages, often reading them multiple times in order to derive their meaning.  It definitely took me out of the story and any feeling of terror eluded me.\n\nBut then I listened to the audiobook and it made a world of difference.  There's a rhythm to Poe's prose I was unable pick up when reading the words on a page, but the narrated version brought them to life.",

I had no ideas on the political or philosophical parts of the book, I just thought it was a wild ride and I loved it. Same with Poe, and The Yellow Wallpaper- which I randomly came across in one of my dad\u2019s college texts and was fascinated by the eeriness of it and it became my favorite short story. I had no idea what postpartum psychosis even was lol. If I tried to read Candide now, I feel like I\u2019d need to brush up on everything I\u2019ve learned about the French Revolution bc that\u2019s the \u201csmart\u201d thing to do.",

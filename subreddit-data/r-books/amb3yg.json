Even being generous and using the much higher number, that's still 7.5% of the 20000 that Australia accepts each year. Now when controlling for the difference in population - NZ has approximately 4.8 million people to Australia's 24.6 million, or ~20% of the population. So with this rough math we're getting 7.5/20 = 37.5% of the intake per capita (and remember this is after NZ raised their intake by 50% for next year, prior to that you'd be looking at 25% of our intake).\n\nNow is the way we are treating people claiming asylum by boat deplorable?

I met some of the most decent human beings in that detention centre. One of the guys there used most of his compensation money to help out ex-staff members who got fired with rent money because some of them couldn\u2019t find work after working in those conditions. There\u2019s so much to talk about and nothing I can say can accurately portray what it was like. Even though I remember everything like I went there two days ago. \nI remember walking with a group of guys to Charlie (one of the compounds that was occasionally used for classes and activities) where I held a class and it was pouring with rain. The stuff I had prepared for class was getting soaked and so was I. Two of the guys had a garbage bag that they was using as umbrellas. One guy took off his garbage bag and wrapped up all my resources and the other one took his garbage bag and insisted that I put it on so I didn\u2019t get wet. It\u2019s a memory that sticks with me, I don\u2019t know why. Maybe I was just surprised how selfless some of the guys were. \n",

You're already supporting him! Just in an inhumane and economically wasteful manner.\n\n3) The man is clearly a gifted writer, winning a $70k+ cash prize.

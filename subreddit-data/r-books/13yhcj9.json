    "postText": "First off sorry for my english and chaotic way of writing...  \n\n\nLast year I started reading Bram Stoker's Dracula, but I couldn't get though the first page. The version of the book that I bought has around 500 translators notes (I'm not sure if that's the correct therm in english, but its the notes/descriptions of words/phrases that the reader might be unfamiliar with) and all of them are on the last page. So I have to read a sentence that contains 2 words (for example one word is a city/area/whatever located in southern Romania for example or whatever) that are listed way back on the book. So I have to shuffle to the back and go again to the page I'm on. Then on the very NEXT SENTENCE there is another 3-5-20 words that have explanations to them, and I have to go back again on the last page. Some of the words were kinda obvious/familiar with, but others not really. If I remember correctly there was an explanation for the british museum or something like that, that I wasn't really obliged to read but I did. The novel was written a long time ago so some things might be quite obvious while others not really.  \n\n\nIn general I'm really interested in the story and I've read that its a fantastic book, but this keeps me from reading it. How should I proceed? Should I ignore most/some of the billions of translators notes (read only the important ones that I think should be read) try another version/copy of the book that doesn't have that problem? Not finishing a book for a stupid reason like this seems... well stupid?  \n   \nAlso why are the notes on some books (I have seen notes on the same page and have seen all the notes on the last page) on the last page? That seems extremely annoying to me. But I guess if you re-read the book it seems pretty logical for that.  \nAfter writing this rant/complaint I find the post to be very ironic... because I'm doing the same thing that stops me reading the book. I write explanations that make it hard for the users to read the post, but whatever.  \n\n\nSorry again and thank you.",

Notes are from translators and/or commentators who are trying to provide context and/or supplemental reading material about the people, places, events, culture, politics, and economy of the time. They also provide additional information in the event that Stoker's words do not translate one-to-one into another language, offering additional context for the translation.\n\nThe only time I would venture to the Notes section is if something you read has a note attached to it and it's something that you don't understand (likely due to the translation into another language).",

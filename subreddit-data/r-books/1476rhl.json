    "postText": "I\u2019m sure there\u2019s already been a lot of discussion about this book and I\u2019m a bit late, but I didn\u2019t expect to like this book so much. A few parts made me laugh but I haven\u2019t read anything so lighthearted and romantic in awhile, and it was hard for me to get into it. I just finished it last night and the ending really did it for me! \n\nI think I had a sort of dread the entire book since it\u2019s a gay story and I\u2019m pretty used to gay stories being tragic. Good storytelling or not, the endless tragedy gets pretty old. A cute, fun and lighthearted ending was such a surprise to me, and I\u2019m happy I gave it the chance to do so!",

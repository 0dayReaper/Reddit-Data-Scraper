    "postText": "I have just finished a trilogy and went on Goodreads to express my thoughts and appreciation. I did skim through the reviews to see what others thought of the books, as one does when stumbles onto the biggest book review site. What I have found is that people leave one star reviews saying *\"it has sexual slavery in it\" \"it has rape in it\" \"it has lots of mention of gay sex in it\"  \"it contains dubious consent\"* etc etc. so it contains what is otherwise known as **triggers** in it. Now, this series' description is quite clear that it has mature content, it has slavery and that this is an enemies-to-lovers, fantasy with M/M romance in it. So assuming one doesn't blindly grab books from the bookshelf/download random stuff to their e-reader it is safe to say that readers are well aware of the summary before diving in, thus giving themselves and the writer consent to deal with and read about such unpleasant or out-of-the-ordinary themes. \n\nIf you know you are sensitive to slavery then why do you choose a book that has it as a main plot driver then go online and moan about it? Nobody forced you to pick this story, nobody forced you to keep on reading. It's like knowing you don't like milk in your tea, but ordering a milky tea then complain about not liking it. Or if you are not sure whether you like milk in your tea and you want to be adventurous and order one, then realise after a sip that this is not for you, you can just leave it and have one made in a way you know you enjoy. Not forcibly slurp it up then go complain about it. \n\nLeaving negative reviews because, let's say, the writing style is not up to your standards or you find the story boring or the characters one-dimensional, that is fair enough and when you see thousands of people saying the same thing chances are their opinion has merit. \n\nWhat really grinds my gears that when it comes to less-known or rising writers working with indie or small publishing houses these, frankly undeserved reviews can cut deep. It will only encourage writers to put themselves in a carefully constructed box of mainstream, acceptable themes and stories, and that is pretty much the death of artistic freedom for the sake of what? Political correctness? If we know anything about human history is that it is full of suffering, struggling, pain and bravery in the face of adversity; all of these include and caused by things modern societies view as triggers. I don't want to live in a world where books are being censored or cleansed for the sake of enlightened modernism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo quote a classic:\n\n&gt; \u201cBut I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.\u201d\n\n**Edit**: Wow, maybe it is not such an unpopular opinion after all,but certainly a bit controversial. Thank you for the awards.\n\nAlso, many of you tried to guess or messaged me asking what trilogy I was referring to. It is The Captive Prince trilogy by C S Pacat.",

It was apparent that it had been translated into a second language and then into English which mixed up a lot of things (think \"Russian-&gt;Chinese-&gt;English instead of straight Russian-&gt;English).  It was only the e-version, and I think it got replaced online when they started making English print copies.",

On Amazon one that really amused me was a one-star review of The Song of Achilles with a picture of the book's cover torn in half by the user saying it was gay propaganda. I mean...in Iliad Achilles talks about kissing Patroclus and mentions \"the unsullied holiness of your (Patroclus') thighs\" ( see [intercrural sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercrural_sex?wprov=sfla1)) so it's not as if we didn't know they were more than just friends. Also the book's blurb explains it is about Patroclus' **romance** with Achilles.",

At the time, it was very popular to interpret the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus as homosexual. In the Iliad itself, them having a romantic/sexual relationship would not be the obvious interpretation.\n\nHowever, two characters in homosexual relationship is not 'gay propaganda' like two characters in a hetero relationship is not 'straight propaganda'.",

But then there were also negative reviews from people who don't like the Twilight books.

Maybe even to criticize the inclusion of such a scene too if it doesn't seem to fit the book. \n\nI feel like some professional reviewers might include a section of their review where they mention their opinion on certain parts after the actual review, which I'd be ok with personally.

If they have to get quantitative with it, i'd kind of prefer goodreads break star evaluations into a couple categories. Maybe something like:\n\n* enjoyable: 1-5 stars\n\n* impactful: 1-5 stars\n\n* informative: 1-5 stars\n\n* well-crafted: 1-5 stars\n\nI havent given those categories much thought or anything, they're just an example.

And I don\u2019t know how to resolve that other than, like, never producing fantasy content (or never letting it reach broad success somehow), going all frame story with the main plot being the fantasies of the people with a healthy relationship in the frame story (which might kill the mood), or an extensive forward and afterword (which most people won\u2019t read).",

You add people and have followers that want to see what YOU post in your review about the book. It's not a review published somewhere professionally or on a site where the book is purchased.\n\nSecondly, even if they were, that's not censorship or the end of art lol.\n\nTHIRDLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, OP says \"it'd be fine if they criticized the plot or said the characters are one dimensional\", but then I go and look at the reviews he's talking about and they have the exact \"fair\" type of criticism he mentions. They were criticizing the plot--- which included the weird way some topics were portrayed. Many people are open to reading about dark themes like slavery or sexual assault, hell some people seek them out, but they're going to have opinions about the specifics lol. That's the whole point of actually reading it and not just reading the summary and calling it a day.\n\nSo JUST saying that a theme is *included* doesn't tell you a lot or make any criticisms void lol. I can say my book handles the theme of racism, but obviously if that theme is more specifically \"racism is actually really cool against these specific people\", people are going to mention that in the reviews (negatively or not) lol. Saying \"WELL IT SAID RACISM WAS INCLUDED, WHY ARE YOU MAD???\" is fucking dumb. Saying your book is about racism doesn't make it obvious to everyone that the book is about how racism is COOL, specifically. You don't know that until you read it, *and* it's a fucking angle of the plot, so it's 100% completely justified to mention in a review.",

What kind of sense does that make?\n\nIf anything, the problem here is overreliance on aggregate user-scores. If someone writes a 1 star review that says \"this book contains time travel, and I hate time travel plots\", that's still useful information for someone trying to do some light vetting before reading something. \"I also hate time travel, thank you anonymous user\" or \"lol wtf is this person talking about, disregarded\"\n\nWhereas if a bunch of people hate time travel, and it all gets rolled into the average score, someone who just sees 2.7/5 but loves time travel might assume it's mediocre instead of polarizing, with a bunch of 5 and 1 star reviews.

            "comment": "\"Entertainment is about how things should be. Art is about how things are\" \n\nThere's a case to be made to ensure movies/books/whathaveyou are packaged with trigger warnings. Once I would have scoffed at that, but seeing a friend of mine having a bit of an episode and unexpectedly revisiting past trauma when a movie we were watching had a sexual assault scene that comes a bit out of left field did a lot to dispel the idea for me that trigger warnings are all just for uptight 20-year-olds who just expect the world to always be palatable and comforting for them. \n\nBut even conceding that, that'd be a fault of the publisher, not the author. If you think prospective readers should be braced for some sort of content, by all means, share that feedback, but understand that  the very presence of topics you find triggering is not a valid critique of the work itself",

The review can be especially helpful to those, of reasons are elaborated on in the review, who may also be triggered by such topics. It isn\u2019t wrong or unjust anymore than the opinion you have posted here is wrong or unjust. It\u2019s just your opinion.",

I wouldn't trash a book just because it has rape in it, but I would have serious issues with a book that shows rape and abuse as the basis for a budding romance.  I would struggle with a book that paints slavery as \"cherishing\" slaves for their sexual \"gifts\" because consent is impossible when a person is OWNED. So yes, I think it is fair to say that some people could read a book and realize they hate it, and review it accordingly.",

            "comment": "A positive review described, \"The Captive Prince trilogy is one of my favorite book series' so far. First thing I will say, it is not a book for everyone, and it rests on the literary edge of what is acceptable. The first book is a relatively isolated experience in really pushing the reader to the limits and is very morally difficult to digest.\"\n\nIt basically says the same thing as negative reviews and lets me know I don't want to read it.  If I were a parent those reviews might tip me off to not share it with a young kid.  (I remember my mom let me watch Risky Business after thinking it was similar to Ferris Buellers Day Off as a kid.)  I haven't had any trauma in my life but find book sex to be awkward and boring. That and most reviews (positive or negative) would lead me to find another series. Others with negative sexual experiences might be traumatized/triggered/whatever.  Netflix has notifications before any episode involving eating disorders, sexual trauma, and things like that.  My aunt on the other hand loves books like this and would dive in immediately.   She looks for hints of sex on the back cover.  I don't see what's wrong with giving honest reviews.\n\nI was actually just as put off by your glowing recommendation in this thread, \"~~Royalty,~~ Fantasy set in a medieval era, Court intrigue, Political machinations, ~~Sword fights,~~ Hidden identity, ~~Enemies to lovers, Sexual tension, Well written erotic scenes worth waiting for, And glorious gay romance.~~  I'd rather replace all those crossed out elements with other things.  And there are books out there that will fill that need as well as include other fantasy/fiction elements rather than romance and love scenes.  I can't think of any time where an erotic scene has enhanced a book for me.  It just doesn't interest me at all.  It would be like trying to get my mom into some of the fantasy lore I love.  It's just not her thing. Why should I struggle through this book when there's so many others from equally unknown writers?  \n\n&gt; If you know you are sensitive to slavery then why do you choose a book that has it as a main plot driver then go online and moan about it?\n\nPerhaps they didn't know and they are now trying to inform others with their review?  Maybe the underestimated how graphic it was? Or we can go with your weird sadist milk theory that they intentionally chose a bad book.  I constantly start books and movies without fully reading up on them.  I've found some great gems as well as real duds that way.  Maybe it's like a 90's restaurant that has a smoking and no smoking section.  Some would have an entirely different area for the smokers while others wouldn't even have a divider and would be filled with smoke even in the non smoking section.  I remember leaving those as a kid.  Perhaps these people underestimated just how sensitive they were or graphic the novel was.  \n\n&gt; I don't want to live in a world where books are being censored or cleansed for the sake of enlightened modernism.\n\nNo one is being censored in this situation, some people just don't like the book.  There's like 20 places I can buy it online right now.  There's tons of positive reviews.  I'd actually argue it's easier now than ever for creators to make their works available to the public with the internet.  Game of Thrones had many/all of the same criticisms and is one of the most successful series out there despite not even being finished.  If people want to consume media without triggers I'm happy they can easily use those reviews to do so.  \n\nIt stinks when something you're passionate about gets a bad review or doesn't' garner the appreciate you think it's deserves.  That's the nature of real reviews though.  The alternative is something like Amazon where they take down bad reviews so it's only the glowingly positive stuff and paid reviews making them not even worth reading.",

I really like aspects of the book (vivid landscape imagery, the cadence of character dialogue) but the incest absolutely grosses me out. I read an entire page of reviews before downloading to my Kindle and it was glowing praise and zero mention of incest. \n\nI would have really liked to have known that before I started. At this point, there is a minor character I like so I\u2019m still reading to see her story arc, but had I known what was in the book, I wouldn\u2019t have bothered. I do plan on leaving a review that\u2019s honest, but with a mild spoiler warning. Not everyone wants to devote hours to a book only to be blindsided partway in by that.",

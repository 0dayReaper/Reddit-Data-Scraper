    "postText": "This is how I look at our (as a civilization) approach to the problem of the rapid development of AI, AGI, ASI; and I concluded that we resemble the societies of Liu Cixin's The Three-Body Problem books.\n\n# Warning, slight spoilers (nothing specific).\n\nWell, we are developing technology that we do not understand the power of, just like in Liu's trilogy, people did not understand the power of the Trisolarians. We alternate between periods of hysteria, fear, acceptance; we have various media messages, from negative to positive; who I wouldn't ask has a different approach to AI development. And the effect will probably be like passing the baton to the successor of the Swordbearer. We as an innocent child with a hand in the potty.\n\nWhat do you think about this reference to the trilogy? Anyone who has read it knows what I mean.",

There's no 'intelligence'.\n\nI do think the current popular 'AI' programs are a bad thing. But that's just because of the data that those companies use to train their models. It's (mainly) data they have no rights on and should not be allowed to use.",

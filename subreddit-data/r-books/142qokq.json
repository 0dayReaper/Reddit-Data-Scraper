Case in point, I\u2019m re-reading \u201cThe Lonesome Gods\u201d and more than once he goes off on historical sea voyages and I can\u2019t see how it ties into the main story.\n\nEven my favorite book of his, \u201cThe Walking Drum\u201d, has parts that I usually skip over when reading it.\n\nAm I the only one that notices this?",

More in the style of classics like Moby Dick, Les Miserable, and Lorna Doone. Tangents were expected back in the \"old days.\" Unlike the modern era where everything has to serve the narrative or its cut. I kinda miss those days...",

If there's something in the book that doesn't interest me, I'll skim through until it's over.\n\nI don't usually let it bother me, though. I realize the tangent is probably interesting to someone - the author, if no one else - and I'm fine with it being in there, but I don't feel at all guilty about not reading it lol.",

It is, all of it, a digression with no bearing on the life (or opinions) of said gentleman. One of the funniest books I've ever read, but... goes off, and never returns, so to speak.",

    "postText": "Hi Reddit. My first book DAUGHTER OF THE MOON GODDESS was released in January 2022, and its sequel HEART OF THE SUN WARRIOR followed in November. Both books are USA Today and Sunday Times bestsellers. The duology is a fantasy inspired by the legend of Chang\u2019e, the Chinese moon goddess. There are immortals, magic, legendary creatures, dragons - but at its heart, it's a story about love.\n\nI grew up in Malaysia, and live in Hong Kong now. I\u2019ve always loved reading and writing, but never imagined I would become a writer - sometimes I can\u2019t believe this is real! It\u2019s been a busy couple of years, and am currently on deadline for my next book. Am excited to be here today, and to answer your questions! \n\nYou can also find me at www.suelynntan.com , or on Instagram @suelynntan.\n\nSue Lynn\n\nUPDATE: Thank you for all the great questions, this has been such fun! My deadline is calling, but feel free to drop any other questions and I can answer them later.\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/uetl714eou2b1.jpghttps://i.redd.it/uetl714eou2b1.jpg",

            "comment": "Hi Sue Lynn. Thank you very much for the AMA!\n\nIf you don't mind rather boring question, how old (by our years?) are Xingyin and her mother across Daughter of the Moon Goddess? I was trying to reconcile the age and maturity of immortals but found myself at a loss for context.\n\nDo you have any dream collaborations or adaptations of your work? Assuming you are allowed to divulge anything if it is underway.\n\nThank you very much for the lovely novels. I hope for all the continued success in your endeavors.",

As the story is about immortals, I preferred not to tie them down to any specific age as I imagine they would not think of time the same way as we do\u2014for example, to them, a decade might feel like a year. A large part of *Daughter of the Moon Goddess* is Xingyin \u2018coming of age\u2019, and I think of her as the equivalent of someone in her late teens, growing to a young woman as the story develops. \n\nIt's been absolutely surreal seeing the book translated into other languages \u2013 the Italian edition released yesterday, and the French one earlier this year. And it's especially meaningful to me that the book will also be translated into Chinese (Traditional). While it would also be an absolute dream to see the story onscreen, I'm am not aware of anything on that front at the moment.",

Her image would be on lanterns, mooncake boxes, and children in Hong Kong learn poems and songs about her too. This story is one that stayed with me over time, perhaps because of its tragic ending when Chang\u2019e flies to the moon. I always wondered why Chang\u2019e took her husband\u2019s elixir and though there were several reasons in the legends, I kept wondering if there might be more behind her decision. From there, I imagined what if she and Houyi had a child, what she would be like, and what she would do to save her mother.",

The legend of the Four Dragons is another one that is woven into the tale, though I took some liberties with their visualization and their role in the story. \n\nI did enjoy writing a new character outside the myth - someone whose story was unchartered, who might have inherited some of her parents' traits and legacies, such as her talent in archery.",

I must admit I cried during the writing of the story too.\n\n\rI love this question. In *Daughter of the Moon Goddess*, I didn\u2019t set out to write a love triangle \u2013 in my mind it was more sequential relationships that were not fully resolved, though it certainly evolved in *Heart of the Sun Warrior*. In my mind, love can be complicated, unpredictable, and sometimes irrational. Emotions can linger long after we want them to. I imagined how the characters might feel in such a situation, how they might react, and how it could change them. I wanted the relationships to feel organic and natural, though this situation can also lead to a lot of angst.",

This is one of my favorite stories since my childhood and I hope you'll find it interesting. \n\n*Daughter of the Moon Goddess* was inspired by the legend of Chang'e, one that is much loved and often retold during the Mid-Autumn festival. According to the myth, long ago ten suns rose in the sky, causing great suffering to the mortals. A great archer named Houyi shot down nine of the suns, leaving one to light the world. The Emperor of Heaven gifted him with the elixir of immortality, but Houyi did not drink it, reluctant to leave his beloved wife Chang\u2019e. However, Chang\u2019e took the elixir and ascended to the skies as an immortal, where some believed the emperor banished her to the moon for her theft.\r\n\nThere are several variations of the legend as to why Chang\u2019e took the elixir \u2013 whether to save it from thieves, or because Houyi became a tyrannical king, or perhaps she desired immortality? I felt it was a hard choice, and wondered what if there might be more behind her decision. It was then, I imagined the existence of her daughter, and the adventures she woudl embark upon as she fought for her mother\u2019s freedom.",

Have any of the conversations or questions you've had while promoting influenced or changed where you take the next part of the story?",

The release of *Daughter of the Moon Goddess* was a little stressful as I was also working on *Heart of the Sun Warrior* then, that was scheduled for release later that year. \rAs it was my debut novel, there was quite the learning curve as I didn't know what to expect. \n\nFor the sequel, I had already drafted the story before most of the promotion took place, along with the ending \u2013 though the \u2018how\u2019 of it, can sometimes be equally challenging. It\u2019s always important for me that the characters\u2019 actions and choices feel natural and authentic to who they are, and what they\u2019ve gone through.",

I loved how you wove an original story into the beautiful Chinese mythology. ~~Do you plan to do any future books based in Chinese mythology?~~ I see you already answered this one, so here is the follow up. Where can we follow you and learn about your upcoming books?",

I don\u2019t see myself as any of the characters \u2013 Xingyin is definitely a lot braver than me, I\u2019d have run away from the nine-headed serpent.

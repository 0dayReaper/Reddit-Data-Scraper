    "postText": "I know there are a lot of Stephen King fans on this sub. I'm not particularly one of them but maybe that's because I've only tried a few of his overlong novels - that's the idea I get from this review in Slate of his 1970s short-story collection Night Shift, which calls it \"the earliest evidence of King\u2019s greatest gift: his twisted and seemingly inexhaustible imagination.\"\n\n\"The inherent economy of the (short story) form means that the idea itself is the star of the show. Each story is like a guy who shows up to the campfire, tells the scariest yarn you\u2019ve ever heard in your life, then promptly leaves before anyone can fuck it all up by asking him to elaborate.\"\n\nhttps://slate.com/culture/2023/06/boogeyman-movie-stephen-king-night-shift-short-story.html",

The short story format kind of rectifies that complaint. I love his novels, but I can totally get why people wouldn't like them. \n\nThere's a story called 'The Last Rung on the Ladder' that's in 'Night Shift.' It's a great story! If people say King can't write good literary fiction, I point to that story.",

Revival had great payoff but the actual build-up (like 99% of the book) was not entertaining or interesting imo. But damn if he had just made a short novella focused on that payoff and maybe fleshed it out a bit more? That'd be great.",

He's amazing at bringing characters and settings to life quickly, introducing really fun/weird/shocking conflicts, and (hooray) creating meaningful endings.\n\nReally, just about any of his shirt story collections is a winner.",

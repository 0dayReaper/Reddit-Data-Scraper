    "postText": "I'm currently at the end of the fifth chapter of *Blood Meridian* by Cormac McCarthy, and I'm not really getting much out of it. It has an amazing reputation, but I'm not quite sure why. Characters don't speak often; when they do, it's with a seemingly deliberate sense of dryness. There's very little wit or engaging material in the way many exchanges are written. When characters aren't speaking, they're riding. Hoo boy, are they ever riding. Riding along through deep valleys of clay and mud, with the hue of the rock that surrounded them on all sides evoking the sanguineous happenings of the day past. And as the pale moonlight desperately searched for a surface to shine off of in the matte landscape, I realized I didn't care. I think I get the psychological effect the book is going for: it bores you with the incessant descriptions of the characters' surroundings and conditions you to seek absolutely anything as a reprieve from the so rigorously established nothingness. As such, you get into the headspace of the characters and look forward to the gross, excessive displays of violence. What's accomplished here, though? There's a tree with dead babies in it. Cool. Someone's arm is rotting and it's gross and oh, look! There are flies eating it! Gross, right? Are you grossed out yet? Is the gore nauseating yet?\n\nI went into this book looking for some sort of engaging historical piece on the American West. I wanted something philosophical and psychological, with characters maybe taking a moment to discuss the morality of their actions. What I'm getting is pages upon pages of well-written prose about venturing through dry, dusty country interspersed with excessive violence. Can someone please explain why people like this book? It's regarded by so many as a masterpiece, and maybe I'm looking at it from the wrong perspective. Thanks in advance for participating in this discussion with me.",

It\u2019s an uninhibited look at the dark side of human nature, seen through the lens of westward expansion.  The Judge\u2019s speech on war (\u201cWAR is God\u201d) is pure genius.  It\u2019s a masterpiece.",

It\u2019s been a minute since I read it, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve made it to the Glanton gang or formally met the Judge (who is the real main character of the book). You may end up not liking the book, but you have not made it to the parts that make people love the book. \n\n2) This book is all show, no tell. There is purposeful clash between subtle metaphors/allusions and crude violence/blatant themes. You are aware of relationship/purpose of the slow pacing followed by extreme violence so the next question is \u201cWhy is McCarthy so obsessed with violence and gore? What is, if there if even is any, the significance of the violence?\u201d There is not a single answer to this and truth be told you may not find a satisfying one. McCarthy is giving you a problem to think about with no particular answer in mind. \n\n2.5) This book is very philosophical, but doesn\u2019t really care about psychology or morality at all. Nobody contemplates the morality of their actions. None of the characters besides the Judge are complex. There\u2019s no internal conflict or character progression. It\u2019s biggest similarity to Moby Dick (outside of long, \u201cboring\u201d scenes) is that it is obsessed with how we ascribe meaning (or how one \u201cthing\u201d can have a multitude of meanings). The characters are there to either illustrate a specific view point or to act as physical embodiments of abstract ideas.\n\nBlood Meridian is not a book for everyone and I have many friends who it took multiple attempts for it to click. I also had friends who tried multiple times and could never \u201cget it\u201d. It may not be for you and that\u2019s okay. \n\nI think I personally got a lot out of it because I had recently read Moby Dick and Paradise Lost which, along with the King James Bible, had the largest influence on the book. I probably wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it nearly as much if I wasn\u2019t organically catching all the allusions.\n\nLate edit so OP prob won\u2019t see this: you would probably like Warlock by Oakley Hall if you want more psychology and character development. Highly under read western.",

Understanding the environment does play a part in this.\n\nIt may be that the book isn't for you, but if you've only read five chapters, it's definitely a little early to give up. Good luck!",

I read it and wasn't too impressed by it, but fast forward to years later and I realize that many of its parts still resonate in my memory. It felt like an immersive experience to read through it and feel like a character in the dark and gloomy atmosphere that the author creates.

And there are lots of folks who think it is (and a few that disagree). Just Google Blood Meridian Nihilism. Here\u2019s on review:\n\n\u201cIf you are a fan of Philosophy, specifically Existential Nihilism, please read this book! Existential Nihilism deals with the value of life. The book asks: what is the significance of one human relative to earth\u2019s existence? What is the purpose of a character or that character\u2019s actions? The book also takes a complex look at morality. There are multiple character studies dealing with this, the most important being those of The Judge and The Kid. These characters are violent and have scarce emotions on the page and their actions leave the reader asking so many questions. Questions regarding a variety of subjects: Good and evil, moral reasoning, metaphysics, the purpose of our existence, etc. This is not meant to scare people away from this book. It should make it more attractive, but that\u2019s me. (You could lure me into a cage with a good philosophy book) To expand on this, I want to reiterate the point I made earlier: this book is very maddening! There are times when a character will question the nature of reality, which in turn will make you question it as well. Let it happen\u2026 it\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\nhttps://oscarwhitewriting.com/2019/11/01/book-review-1/",

            "comment": "There is a great deal of exposition from many characters, and they do tell stories and describe their views (especially a character you really haven't met yet- The Judge- who will go on at length describing his own philosophies, which will appear more and more chilling as you progress through the story). But even with all his discussion, the Judge's intentions, his actions, his very nature, all remain obscure. McCarthy doesn't hand you anything in this book. There are no answers, at least obvious answers. But there are questions. He describes things (beautifully), things happen in a way that sticks with you, and the world he builds itself is alive with its own energy and life. There is a lot of extreme violence. There is also humor and great sadness (the image of a girl crying with a dying bear in her lap will break your heart). But you won't get a simple moral history with ready exposition from this book (or rather, you may get some of that, especially from the Judge, but that exposition will itself only raise more questions- and maybe the hairs on the back of your neck). This is the kind of book that burns away long after you read it, it haunts the edges of things, and long after you've read it you will find yourself suddenly pondering it all over again. I've re-read it a few times, even listened to it on audio, and each time I see it in a different light, the answers that seemed so clear aren't there anymore, and at the end I  only have more questions. The only book I've found to be as elusive for me (other than McCarthy's other books) is Conrad's *Heart of Darkness.* It reminds me of a physics lecture, where you're able to follow the reasoning from step to step, it even seems simple. Until you try to explain this simple thing you learned to someone else: and you find the steps that got you there are already lost, slipping away like water through your fingers.",

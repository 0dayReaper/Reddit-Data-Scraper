I personally have finished all of Charles Dickens, Jane Austen and George Orwell, however, I haven't done it for anymore authors. On the other hand, I have set myself to read more different authors, such as Steinbeck, Christie, Dexter and lately: Stephen King. But has anyone tried to do 'All books By An Author' type of reading?",

To me even with breaks their style (not just prose style but overall storytelling style, like the types of choices they make around plots and characters) tends to become overfamiliar with more exposure and I like it less.

New favorite!\n\nBook 2: 4 stars, not amazing like book 1, but solid. \n\nBook 3: 3 stars, meh, bloom is off the rose. \n\nBook 4: 2 stars. This is tedious at best, problematic at worst. I\u2019m done with this author and their obnoxiousness!\n\nGiven that, there *are* a few authors whose entire (book) outputs I\u2019ve read but they tend to be authors who\u2019ve published fewer than 5 books!",

They are not bad reads by any means but they tend to be a bit repetitive because Ishiguro\u2019s methods to incorporate the techniques of a specific literary genre (for example, the detective novel in WWWO) into his trademark style doesn\u2019t work as perfectly as with his other novels.  \nA similar case could be made for Klara and the Sun, though, which I loved.",

To me, it seemed like there were a lot of references to his previous books. Here are some examples:\n\n&gt;!There's a character called the Kid, like in Blood Meridian. There's a sibling relationship like in Outer Dark. There's stumbling upon something and getting pulled into something bigger, like in No Country. There's a description of crossing the US/Mexico border like in the Border Trilogy. The description of the aftermath of the nuclear bomb in Japan was reminiscent of The Road.!&lt;\n\nThese all felt like very intentional nods to his other books, especially with how disconnected from the plot some of them were. I'd be curious to know you're thoughts since you've read more of his work.",

Sanford and Slaughter are escapism. Like eating salted peanuts. I only the really bad ones stand out. \n\nI am in my 70s. I started \"the classics\" at 10. I actually played hooky for an entire semester of grade six and read all day.  Used my cousins Radio Flyer to bring home books from the library. I remember being on the verge of tears when a new librarian telling me that I had exceeded the checkout limit. The librarian who had been there since I got my library card interceded on my behalf. \n\nIn grade 7, I met my BFF and we set a goal of reading our entire local library. We started on different rows and shared with each other the books that we found most interesting. We have very different preferences and as adults only shared King horror.\n\nI think that my reading is a tad obsessive. At least that is what my mother thought when she discovered that refusing to let me go outside to play was not a punishment because it gave me more time to read.",

It's easy if you love a writer's style to go for just one more, but I've found that some authors get really good over time, but started off a pit patchy. Kim Stanley Robinson is a good example- I loved Ministry For The Future so picked up Forty Kinds of Rain, and hated it. I'll stick with his later novels. Other writers are consistently good, but work thematically and it's hard to live everything they do. Adrian Tchaikovsky's novels that include animal and alien intelligence I could read all day, but I'm not so interested in his fantasy stuff because although I like the genre, I don't love it. I might go back to his other stuff later though. It's a bit like David Bowie' output- you can love most of his work, but nobody ever sits at home on their own and listens to The Laughing Gnome.",

This started me on a love affair with Tom Robbins, and his quirky, beautiful outlook on life. I enjoyed his novels until Fierce Invalids from Hot Climates. His writing changed, probably a result of pretty self confessed prolific cocaine use. Became dark and cynical, less female friendly. Tibetan Peach Pie was a massive ego massage, enlightening only in that it revealed he\u2019d grown up  about fifty miles from me, in the Blue Ridge mountains of NC, and not on the West Coast, as I\u2019d always presumed. Wished I had stuck with his first five or so novels.",

Though it took a bit (by \u201ca bit\u201d I mean a lot of time) of time cause I had finals to study for plus the woman has like 70+ books. I was only able to read 16 of her short stories tho, cause I was, bored? Well not bored but I couldn\u2019t find another word. I wanted to try a different genre. I had only read 3 or 4 books, from different genres, the whole time I was trying to finish Christie\u2019s books.\n\nEdit: going to 11th grade next year and we get assigned some books to read over the summer for language classes (in my case, English, Arabic, French, and Spanish). What\u2019s one of the books I get assigned to read over the summer? Death on the Nile and Murder on the Orient Express.",

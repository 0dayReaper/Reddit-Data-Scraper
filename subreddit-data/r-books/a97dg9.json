It's a tradition to put your shoe (If you're a child) in the window and if you have behaved well during the day you will get a day the morning after, behave badly and you will get a potato (not that I ever got one, cuz I'm a good boi). They have hilarious names as well, such as doorslammer, sausage swiper and window Peeker (hmmm). You can Google \"the Icelandic Yule lads\" or \"jolasveinar\". ",

To start with, it's not just really a tradition, it's more likely just an internet lie based on a slight truth. 60+ years ago, getting a book was a great present and so reading, I'm guessing would just be the best thing to do. Today, it doesn't really happen as much. \n\nSo, to answer your question, no, not many families participate in this tradition ",

Now we do kind of like a secret santa where we pick a book especially for someone, and it is so much fun. We still get a gift on Christmas Eve, and it also shows that the person giving you the book knows you and thought about you. It\u2019s actually really special. Last year my dad gave me Z:A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald, and I gave my mom The Bean Tree by Barbara Kingsolver. We both loved our books and we got to talk about why we loved them, so it was great even after Christmas was over. I would highly recommend this tradition regardless of the legitimacy of its practice in Iceland. ",

J\u00f3lab\u00f3kafl\u00f3\u00f0 just is a word that means Yule-book-flood and means that during this specific time of year most publishers decide to flood bookstores with new books before Christmas. We have a special book called B\u00f3kat\u00ed\u00f0indi (book news) that summarizes all the books that are new that year for people to browse.\n\nEven though it is a tradition for many Icelandic people/families to give books on the 24th of december, this is not an Icelandic tradition per se. In my experience (as limited as it may be for a 33 year old), books are given to people when you have no idea what the heck the other person wants. It's a very safe gift.\n\nIn the same way giving books is a tradition in Iceland I'd argue that watching Die Hard or doing a LOTR marathon is also a tradition here. That doesn't mean that everyone does it though.\n\nIceland is great and all, but we're not magical creatures.

And I don't recall having heard anybody I know even mention this thing ever in a conversation.. \nI think it's more like an option for people who are interested in reading or want to exchange books they got for christmas and didn't want, or have read already.. or something..!!",

I want it to catch on everywhere.\n\nEdit:  \n\nWho cares if it is not an exact embodiment of the reality of Icelandic Christmas tradition?  \n\nA book list does happen annually in Iceland.  So turning a commercialization of Christmas-time publishing into something nicer is fine with me.  \n\nBooks are a \u201csafe\u201d gift, according to many commenters, so why not a purposefully literacy-promoting gift?  A nod to Iceland is out of respect for the germ of a great idea.  \n\nWe regift books we read throughout the year that we think are especially good picks for one another.  We look in thrift stores for the odd but interesting.  We do running jokes in book themes.   We end up about equal for fiction and non-fiction and it always surprises us how thoughtful the selections end up being.  In fact, the books feel far more personal than the \u201cstuff\u201d presents that are opened on Christmas Day.  \n\nWe genuinely love the day as the real treat of Christmas.\n\nWe could hardly be considered a \u201cChristian\u201d household in the first place so the religious holiday associations are not important to us.

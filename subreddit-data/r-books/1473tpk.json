Feminine without dampening her strength as a warrior, her strength as a warrior not dampening her femininity. Such a wonderful balance. Highly recommend to those that enjoy the fantasy category in a world that is not European mythology.",

They captured the fantastical element of myths so well and the characters still felt relatable. The journey of the main character felt earned which was so awesome, she didn\u2019t fall into her achievements and it was so refreshing! Great books!",

The whole point of spending time in prison is to turn out people who are rehabilitated, functioning members of society who have learned their lesson and no longer want to lead lives of crime.\n\nI guess this means we\u2019ve given up pretending that the prison system is anything other than for profit.",

There's a ton of judges that get kickbacks for sending people to specific prisons.\n\nBut even that aside, the ideology behind the US justice system, and even how the population at large views prison, has nothing to do with rehabilitation. It's all crime and *punishment* here. I've heard so many Americans scoff at how prisons in some other countries work, saying that prisons there are more like camps than anything, and that prisoners shouldn't have access to things like televions, video games, decent food, etc.\n\nThe US mentality is metaphorically an eye for an eye. If you break the law, you need to *suffer* for it. Some have a thin facade that this reduces recidivism (though they ignore all studies that suggest what these other countries are doing is *far* better at reducing recidivism than pure punishment), others don't even try to pretend. We're one or two steps below just stoning people who step out of line.\n\nHonestly, it's pretty depressing... Even people I know that support justice system reform and focus on true rehabilitation only do so on paper. As soon as a high profile case comes up all they want is pure punishment and even outright torture.\n\nIt's actually kinda... Scary... I pray I never end up in the system knowing what position it'll put me in. ",

You need to offer excellent access to physical and mental health supports, group therapy, physical activity, and opportunities for betterment. You also have to follow it up with better after-prison care - a parole system whose function is firstmost support rather than surveillance. Work opportunities. Counsellors.\n\nBut that's all expensive. It would lead to a safer, happier society but it's expensive and we don't want to pay for it. \n\nAnd would deprive the country of an enormous and INCREDIBLY CHEAP labour force that can be used to enrich corporations.\n",

These tests use cheap reagents that will fire off for all kinds of common household products found on fabrics, in cars, wherever. People have been caught for months in jail over kitty litter in their car...which ends up costing tax payers money and harming society for short term security theater etc\n\n\u2022 Evidence admission loopholes in favor of the prosecution - You can give exonerating statements to an officer of the law when they first contact you which is inadmissible as hearsay, yet anything that you say that is construed as supporting the prosecution heard in the same conversation is suddenly just fine for admission. Literally, insanely whatever you say in defense of yourself accurately and truly to an officer isn't admissible if the prosecution wants to push it, but anything taken out of context that can be used against you in the same conversation is allowed...let that sink in. There are all kinds of bizarre loopholes like this because of the \"adversarial\" arrangement of the legal system designed to preserve more the nature of \"us vs them\" then \"finding the truth\". \n\n\u2022 Political nature of prosecution, officers and general agents of the state - Prosecutors half to work with the same people all the time. They have no real power to halt a bad faith case on their own. They have to follow through with even shit cases unless there is such extraordinary evidence to exonerate immediately that it would be more embarrassing for the DA's office to not act on it. Most of the time, people get steamrolled into plea deals for terrible, lack of evidence cases just to keep the wheels turning and prosecutors can't be using their real judgement because they'd be fired very quickly for not keeping numbers up.\n\nFor profit prisons are just the tip of the ice-burg. There are tons of issues that need to be solved by updating laws and improving on the concept of the adversarial \"justice\" system. (Really a legal system...)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

In Europe the focus tends to be putting people on the right path again.  The punishment of imprisonment is part of that, but the focus is on trying to steer people the right way so that they can rejoin society and do better.  \n\nIn the USA, imprisonment seems to be much more about punishing people for what they did, not for the sake of trying to put them on the right path again, but as retaliation for what they did.\n\nAmerica's extremely long sentences for crimes that don't deserve it (like drug possession) is part of the problem, but another part is that society sees people convicted of a crime as pieces of shit who deserve it, regardless of circumstances or potential for those people to turn their lives around.  Even now, with all these prison problems in America, being tough on crime is still seen by many as a desirable political viewpoint.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that while prison reform can help in America, society also needs to be more willing to give people a second chance, otherwise ex convicts can never really integrate with society again.  As long as people hold this viewpoint that convicts got what was coming to them, regardless of how excessive the punishment was, these prison problems just seem to be part of the greater problem of focusing some much on retaliation and making sure people get what's coming to them, and focusing so little on rehabilitation and second chances.",

What they do is, create an environment where prisoners who are freed will re-offend. \n\nThey do this in a number of ways when you get out by limiting opportunities to rehabilitate while you\u2019re inside and outside. \n\n1 - Probation will control what kind of jobs and other aspect is things you can do. Generally if it\u2019s a good job, you can\u2019t do it. \n\n2 - PO - are incentivized to catch people as opposed to help them. This means that they will find a way to have you violate and go back \n\n3 - Financially cripple users to the point they cannot live a normal life or afford legal representation. For example, I believe we are the only country in the world with public offenders database. This causes people to be outcasted and never be able to enter society again. Thus, they result in being homeless (which is a crime) or committing crimes to eat.  \n\n4 - Some felons are not permitted to start their own business. So they can\u2019t get a job to feed them and they can\u2019t start their own either. They way they do is by limiting the fields you can work in etc. \n\n5 - Felons are denied passports often. This doesn\u2019t allow them to move to another country and start over. \n\n6 - Once you\u2019re a felon, any police or fed is allowed to violate your rights. Reason being, having a previous criminal record is sufficient to establish \u201cReasonable Cause\u201d.  This means they can enter your house without a warrant. Search your car without a warrant and generally make your life miserable. \n\nIt\u2019s hell for prisoners. Our founding fathers established a system where once you paid for you crime you would be allowed to enter society again. However in today day, you can and never will be able to enter society with a felony. \n\nEssentially, a criminal conviction is a lifetime conviction no matter how light or dark the crime is. You will pay for it until you die.  \n\nEdit - Plea deals  are fucking nightmare. I.e. You either plead guilty for a 6 month sentence or your risk a jury finding you guilty and you get the mandatory 5 years minimum. What kind of person would turn that offer down? Either way, your life is over. \n\nThis is done All for numbers. DA and departments want conviction rates for better funding. \n\nWe\u2019ve become so obsessed with meeting goals, generating numbers that we\u2019ve stopped caring for our fellow person and acting in their best interest. \n\n\nApologizing for typos.

I won\u2019t lie- often it\u2019s escape (so many guys wanted \u201curban\u201d books, which books down to \u201cgangsters having hot nasty sex with hot nasty women\u201d, Twilight, or anything by James Patterson.)\n\nBut others read to learn. I saw a skinhead come into the library with 88 tattoos and the rest come in to read, and left that behind as he read. I saw guys who would try to learn history, or a skill. I read books on management that serves me now as a indie tech writer and project manager (indie because then nobody asks for a background check and assumes I\u2019m going jump out the window to grab someone\u2019s joint or kid or poodle and get my freak on).\n\nWhen I got in books from family, like the entire volumes of Proust (thanks Dad), those books were subjected to a more intense anal cavity than I had the first five times they checked me as I moved from camp to camp. \n\nSure - there\u2019s bullshit books like Scientology nonsense or weirdo alien cult nonsense. But there\u2019s also books on meditation. Religious stuff and while I\u2019ll never understand Christian religious prisoners who wanted to lecture me the atheist on how to be a good Christian after selling their grandmother\u2019s jewelry to buy their hooker girlfriend a tattoo, at least it can make them think. \n\nMaybe they\u2019re getting in a lot of dreck from places who just want to offload old books. But \u201cit\u2019s a security risk\u201d is nonsense. \n\nIn my opinion. But I could be wrong. ",

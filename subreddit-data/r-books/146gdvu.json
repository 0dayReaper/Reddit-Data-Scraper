    "postText": "So for today I finished up one of Neil Gaiman's shorter novels, this being \"Stardust\".\n\nTristran Thorn embarks on a quest to find a fallen star to fulfill a promise that he made to the woman that he loves. But he is not the only one who is seeking the star.\n\nThere are other individuals who are also in search of the star for reasons that are entirely their own. And the star? Well, let's just say that the star might not be what, or who, it might really be.\n\nIt's no secret that Neil Gaiman is quite influenced of fantasy ranging from the traditional fairy tales and the writings of Lord Dunsany as well as poetry and the works of Shakespeare. \"Stardust\" is a wonderful modern fairy tale. But this not a fairy tale meant for children as it is quite adult oriented (as the fact that it won the Mythopoeic award for adult literature). Though it should be brought to mind that many fairy tales of the past has an adult element to them.\n\nBut still this is an enchanting and charming novel from a great author. Though it isn't too long (at least 233 pages long), it is still a beautiful read regardless. This book, for me, would certainly be considered as a classic of fantasy.\n\nAnd there are many people who would agree with me on that notion. Just a beautifully written story! Really a charmer!",

Apparently he wrote it for his wife who doesn\u2019t like fantasy - so it\u2019s fantasy for those who don\u2019t like fantasy. Such a great novel!",

Also for some reason I feel like Tristan was so cavalier about all the bizarre or supernatural things that happened in front of him, like when he describes the flying ship or the unicorn. I guess it was a play on his inherently magical nature due to his mothers side, but I loved it regardless lol, it made me laugh a couple times",

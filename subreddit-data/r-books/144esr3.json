    "postText": "As im writing this I just closed the book, and honestly don\u2019t know what to feel, so please excuse my plump writing as I\u2019m still having a little bit of a hard time coming \u201cback\u201d after finishing this book in one sitting. I must say that I really enjoyed the mixture between Prosa and poetry, and while it did have Kangs gentle madness and I did feel like this was intended to be more of a linguistic art work. I\u2019m sure that reading it in Korean would have had a bigger impact. I cannot stop to wonder if the women in the book is somewhat a reflection of herself and her struggle with language and lack of finding a voice as it was first written in 2011 when she felt disconnected from words. \nMuch like her the ending came somewhat fast, but nevertheless well and soft spoken, it just leaves me wondering what is to become of those two enjoying the silence with each other and the woman having her first word spoken again. With both stories written in the third person, making it almost feel like I\u2019m glancing at a much too intimate scene I shouldn\u2019t have looked at, feeling like I know them fully and somewhat not at all. While I really can\u2019t grasp what exactly I\u2019m feeling right now, I do love that well written books. What impressions or opinions did you have?",

Third person is someone recounting someone else's experience altogether, two times removed from myself, at least. \n\nLuckily you can basically filter books out by going to a shop/library and opening to any random page, or checking out a sample text/audio online.",

The conceit is that they\u2019re telling their story directly *to* you, not that they *are* you.\n\nHowever, I have a somewhat similar issue with it, which is that there\u2019s only so much perspective a person can have on themselves. (Admittedly lots of self-reflection can improve that considerably, but believably self-aware people aren\u2019t always the best fictional leads.) So being in the narrator\u2019s head can sort of obscure their personality, while third person allows the narrative to have more perspective on the character, which can bring them to life more. \n\nOf course it depends on the writer\u2019s skill in the end. If they do a fabulous job with voice then every word in the novel is  characterization, and the protagonist will be distinctive and memorable. But if it\u2019s just a run-of-the-mill voice because the author defaulted to first person without being fabulous at it, then the first person washes out all personality and runs together with every other generic first person book you\u2019ve ever read. Every word in the first person is characterization and now you have a protagonist characterized by being bland and basic. \n\nThen you have the worst case scenario in which the first person is clearly the *author\u2019s* voice but doesn\u2019t actually suit the *character*. Nothing to be said for those but \u201cwhere was the editor?\u201d",

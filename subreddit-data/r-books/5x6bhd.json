But instead of sitting there staring at the blank screen, the words often flow better.  Then I go back and add/subtract/edit afterwards without any sort of inebriation.  It just makes getting the base coat on easier.  Getting *something* down that I can then mold and shape when I have my head on straight.\n\nThat being said, over the years, I've tried (and mostly succeeded) in breaking this habit.  Because I don't want to wholly rely on any sort of substance to help stir my creativity, it's a dangerously thin line to walk.  Unfortunately, it has been one of many factors that has resulted in me writing a lot less.  \n\nBack when I use to smoke weed though, jeez, I could get NOTHING done on it.  Have no idea how anyone could.  I'd just space out and not be able to concentrate.  Would usually just give up and go watch cartoons.  Haha.\n\n\"On Writing\" was an infinitely huge help in my most recent push to get back into writing.  \n\n",

According to his granddaughter, he would write in the early early morning.  While perfectly sober.\n\nAfter that, your guess is as good as mine.  He'd get drunk, fist fight some sort of wild animal, catch a giant fish, party with Fidel Castro, and then go read in a bar somewhere while getting even drunker.\n\nBut when writing, he was sober.\n\nThose were the few hours a day, in the early morning, he would stay sober.  \n\nOr so the family says.",

At one point he'd managed the literary estate. So he was exceptionally qualified for the job. \n\nHe said Hemingway would write from like 6:00am - 10:00 or 11:00, and that was all the writing he'd do for the day. Sometimes he'd bang out pages in those hours and other times, he'd labor over a paragraph. \n\nThen, you're right, I guess he'd hit the whiskey bottle, fight a leopard, and break up one of his marriages.

It was more about the tightness of a small town unraveling than about aliens.

Thats my take, intentional or drug induced. ",

I'd heard The Shining was really good, but I also heard it was very different from the book and that Stephen King didn't like the adaption, so I wanted to read the book first.\n\nThe case that I think is a bit more exceptional is that I had no idea that The Princess Bride was made into a movie until I did a class presentation on the book in 6th grade and literally every kid in that class had seen it.",

He hit King with his van, nearly killing him. (The dog was distracting him, apparently) The brush with mortality made him worry that he'd leave his magnum opus unfinished, so he banged it out all at once.  Part of what made the first four books so good was that they were reflective of where King himself was at the stage of his life at which they were written, giving each book a semi-distinct voice.  Had he not been whalloped, and had he kept to the same schedule as the first four, the series would be finishing right about now.  So I guess what I'm saying is, someone should hit George R. R. Martin with a van?  This plan couldn't possibly go wrong.",

It's all perfectly set up but in over a year I've not spent any time in there. I haven't painted, or created anything. I'll go in there to grab a pair of scissors or a spool of thread if I need to, other than that I avoid it. Just today I came up with the idea of making it into a play room with a corner for myself so my family could be with me and I might be more inclined to go in and spend time there. Ive been searching for second hand sofas. I knew me and Stevie boy were connected. He's the only guy I've ever read. \n\nEdited to clarify my last sentence: I should have said 'only author'. I don't exclusively read books by female authors, I just don't read books. The only books I have started and finished were by Stephen king. I know this is like admitting that I sacrifice kittens for shits and giggles... There's many reasons why I haven't gotten into reading books, all excuses, of course. The main reason is because I like doing more than one thing at a time and books don't allow for that. My hands are tied up and concentration is key. Other reasons are, I am impatient, I get sidetracked, I like movies better... etc",

It's like in Good Will Hunting when Robin Williams is telling him that all Matt Damon knows is what he's read in a book.  He can't tell someone what it smells like to stand in the Sistine Chapel.  He's not living life and soaking in the details. ",

And over the last 30+ years, they've grown together like a tapestry, along with my own experiences and emotions that I have experienced reading his books at different times in my time. It all fits together, good and bad and I think his writing has made a huge impact on me, and the person that I am. ",

I thought IT was decent enough, and The Gunslinger was okay, but I could not get into The Stand - something about the writing makes me read it as if it were written by a child (I am not trying to knock King, he's clearly far more successful than I will ever be, and I realize I am in the minority here). There's just not enough beauty in the language (in my opinion) to justify the length of his novels and the tangents (something I absolutely love in other books). I am currently trying to get through On Writing, as I usually have one book about the craft going as I read something else, and I think I might just put it aside. It's so highly regarded on here, and I'm wondering why? \n\nAm I reading the wrong books by him? Is it me? If anyone has any advice on appreciating Stephen King, please share. ",

The Gunslinger is part 1 in a 7 part series, so if you thought that was okay maybe try tracking down the next few books. \n\nGive The Shining, Revival, Lisey's Story, or Mr. Mercedes a try. One of my guilty pleasures is Cell, but that one isn't nearly as highly regarded as other books, and enough movies have been done on the subject to justify giving it a pass. \n\nYou might also try taking a look at some of his short story collections, like Everything's Eventual or Full Dark No Stars. After you find yourself enjoying King, you can go back and try to get through The Stand again.",

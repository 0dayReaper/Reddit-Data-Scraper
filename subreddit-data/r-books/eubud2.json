Also libraries don't just do books, ours has people who come and do discussions, we caught one a while ago with a guy from NASA.  They have a chess club, programming club and they have a small theater for kids reading and small children's theatre.",

Shoot the state will help them with a place to live and send them to school to get their CDL if they are willing to try.  Does Denver not have programs and what not I know that city north of you Cheyenne has some wonderful programs for the less fortunate.\n\nEdit: If you want to downvote why not create a discussion as to why I'm wrong?

It\u2019s usually quite a process to get help from the church, especially if you are not a member. Many people must go through a process and check off many boxes before the church will give them even food or housing. One of those check boxes is applying for government assistance first before they can receive from the church. The members, from my experience, give more then the church does.\n\nThere are some family services, counselors, etc, but they are all LDS based and usually not open to non-members. I think the homogeneity of Utahn\u2019s religion may play a part, but I do not think they replace government resources.",

I did the same thing with insurance and realtor license.  Well the school I went to was state run and most of the people in the program were there for free and they had jobs waiting for them that paid 50k+ a year.  I grew up in California and the problem is the way they approach the situation, infact it usually feels like they encourage it.  I love California but dang that place is a mess and the slope is simply becoming steeper over time.  \n\nI spent some time in Cheyenne Wyoming several years ago and had a fair amount of free time to just wander.  At first I did not know what I was seeing as I did my city walks.  What I was seeing was the city helping the homeless with shelter, jobs and transportation to those jobs.  They had these little white busses that would show up and all these people would just be there getting onto them.  After a few weeks of hanging around the city I met a homeless man who was washing business windows for money and he got into a program that gave him a place to live and a way to save the money he was making.  He explained what was going on and after a few months this guy had his own apartment that he paid for and a beater car that was his and he was succeeding in life.  All these people were moving up and getting their stuff together, it's a beautiful thing to see a person go from hopelessness to having dreams and aspirations that previously seemed impossible.  We need to give out more fishing rods and fewer fish so people can make their own destiny and not rely on the scraps from others.  I know some people simply need help for day to day existence but far too many just want to skate along at the minimum effort.",

But that's not the only reason why I stopped reading. \n\nI started college in August in a large city. I used to live in a town of 2,000, and now it's 996,726. A couple of weeks ago I went to the county library in the new city to get a card and just check it out in general. My mind was blown away. All of the libraries around me are gigantic, nice, and have a huge amount of resources. They have study rooms, tons of computers, classes, self checkouts, GED classes, and video games!!! And there's four within a 15 minute drive of me! \n\nGoing from a rinky dink, loud, and cramped library to a large, gorgeous and quiet one is life changing. They have video games and comic books and six jammed pack shelves of DVDs and TV Series. My old library had a small bookcase (like one you would find in a home) of DVDs. My love of libraries has been restored, because I actually found a good one.",

We run kids' tech workshops regularly. Have choir performances. We try to have at least one science talk by an expert per month. We run specialist one-off presentations regularly (Off the top of my head, these have recently included 'How to keep chickens', 'Planting native gardens', and 'Financial Literacy for Families'). I coordinate educational charities visiting preschools and primary schools and high schools ( Like Engineers without Borders or the state museum etc). Run at least one directed subject adult tech class a quarter ( teaching a specifc tech skill/program). We show free movies in the holidays. Run a spelling bee for adults once a year, coordinate even more special programs with two local festivals, we run holiday kid's craft sessions. We run specialist book clubs, hold a teens-only night once a year... and this is not counting  the regular clubs that we help run but which are officially part of other groups - like chess clubs, latin classes, poetry groups... etc. There's shitloads more I am forgetting or don't have space to include.\n\nAnd my library is in a *small* town.\n\nCity libraries are *busy* and full of cool programs to get involved in. It is very much a cultural hub. I literally have multiple award-winning authors I am now on first name terms with because they tend to retire to my town... and they all use the library, then turn up to heaps of the events I plan. And sometimes ask for research help. Ditto for artists. (And when I am superlucky, they volunteer to present a program or two)\n\nLibraries are very much part of the cultural fabric. They underpin a lot of the creative work of local artists and the richness of the local cultural life.",

I could always find something that interested me. But a few years ago I moved to Boston and my god is the library system fantastic. Every single book I've looked for has been in their system, and if it's not at my branch right then, it's there by the next business day. And books are just a fraction of the services they offer. There's so many that I'll never fully utilize everything they have. It's a fantastic resource, and I sing it's praises to anyone who will listen .\n\nVisit your local libary!!

You might live 2 hours from a pro sports team but also have a library\n\nBooks are cool, libraries are cool, don\u2019t understand the comparison though",

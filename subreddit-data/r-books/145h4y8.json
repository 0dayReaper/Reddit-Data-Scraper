    "postText": "Andy Weirs The Martian is nothing more than a cleverly disguised entry into the ever-popular isekai genre. Yes, you heard it right. We might miss Truck-Kun, but his distant cousin, the rude Sandstorm-Chan, still delivers.\n\nIn isekais, the protagonist is usually taken away to another world or universe where they must fend for themselves. In The Martian, Mark Watney finds himself stranded alone on... another planet. Suddenly, our brave astronaut is forced to navigate an environment that might as well be an alien world.\n\nAlso, let's not forget the isekai trope of having an overpowered main character who possesses unparalleled abilities or knowledge. While Mark Watney may not be endowed with magical powers or cheat codes, he is portrayed as someone with a vast knowledge, not only in botany and mechanical engineering, but also on other \"science\"-stuff- He clearly possesses more expertise than your average astronaut could ever dream of. And of course, he almost never fails in his endeavors and if he does, it is never due to his own personal shortcomings, which appear to be non-existent, but rather due to external causes outside his control. Still, like your generic isekai, he perseveres, persists and perdures and emerges victorious with little to no trouble at all.\n\nWhile our hero is not collecting his very own harem like in most isekai (unless you count potatoes), he does attract a wide array of female admirers who get weirdly sexual about him. Meanwhile, his male colleagues maintain a professional respect for his exploits. Can't have any homoeroticism in our male targeted escapism. But just like in other isekai stories, side characters serve as mere plot devices, with little to no character arc of their own and distinguishable features that go beyond their roles in relation to the protagonist. All secondary characters simply get sidelined for the sake of the protagonist's heroic exploits.\n\nMark Watney loves, loves, loves the grind. I believe he even mentions it himself at some point. I distinctly remember the time he watneyed all over his crops. It's almost as if he's trying to level up his survival skills like an isekai character grinding for experience points. Page after page, I awaited a status window to pop up, displaying all his newfound skills and abilities of Mars Simulator: Potato Edition. It doesn't happen (spoiler!), but I wouldn't have been surprised if it did.\n\nIt's time to acknowledge the truth! The Martian is not just a science fiction tale; it's a clever ploy to introduce unsuspecting Western readers to the gripping genre that is isekai. By masquerading as a serious space survival story, it slyly captures readers' attention and draws them into the world of homocidial truck drivers and overpowered protagonists.",

The medium is full of way too many of them, to the point that it\u2019s hard to find a new manga that *isn\u2019t* an isekai.\n\nA lot of bad isekai have the following tropes going on:\n\n* The protagonist knows ridiculous amounts of modern stuff that happens to be really useful in the feudal, pseudo-medieval society that he\u2019s wound up in.\n\n* All the girls (or guys if it\u2019s a female protagonist) are crazy for the main character (hence \u201cbuilding a harem\u201d).\n\n* The main character is really strong or otherwise impressive by the standards of people in the new universe, despite being painfully ordinary when they lived in our world.",

Working with others would mean he'd probably pick up on a few things, or would get trained in those fields a bit.\n\nNone of the girls in The Martian are crazy for Mark Watney. And no, wanting to rescue him doesn't count.\n\nStrong and impressive are the only things he can be, when trapped alone on an entire inhospitable planet. If he doesn't engineer a way to survive long enough to get rescued, then he dies. There's no room for \"ordinary\" in that situation.",

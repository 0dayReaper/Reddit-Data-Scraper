The issue is that the local economy in western Montana, especially in the Flathead valley, has blown up astronomically in the last 10 years. Everyone I went to school with can't afford to live in the place they grew up. Things have gotten so expensive, mostly land, housing, and rent, that they don't make enough to survive, even with 2 incomes. A lot of out of state wealthy people, especially californians, have moved in with remote work and a lot of money. However, they aren't bringing businesses and jobs with them, so our lower wage jobs aren't paying anywhere near enough to pay for housing. People have watched a quiet, beautiful valley turn into a busy, crowded, and far too expensive place to live. People are losing the place they grew up in because rent has doubled or tripped in the valley. My dad is a landlord. He has two separate pieces of land that went for about 100k to 125k 5 years ago. Now, both value at around 450k each. These are small plots of land with crappy trailer houses on them. The people who grew up and made a life for themselves here can no longer afford to exist, and that's through no fault of their own. So they are very angry at the people who've moved there and ruined the economy for the locals. They feel like their homes are being stolen out from under them by wealthy Californian assholes. So don't take it personal, they're pissed and it's all California's fault to them. Also, they were only nice if you were white before this all went down anyways. It's still hella conservative and racist up there.",

But I\u2019m not going to be forced from exploring MY COUNTRY because these people have suffered due to people who are not like me and people who have done unfortunate things. You mention Flathead Valley, named for the Flathead native Americans. They were also treated despicably by the white people, and I don\u2019t see them striking back at me. None of us are blameless here when it comes to taking what is not ours.\n\nNow, do these resentful Montanans want to take action that improves their lives? Welcome tourists. Take our money. Show us the beautiful scenery. Win-win. I don\u2019t know why they would actively discourage people like me visiting their state (which is a part of MY country). I\u2019m not excusing this bad behavior. I was literally afraid for my life a couple of times, when they tried to run us off the road. There is NO excuse for that behavior.\n\nAnd as far as people moving to Montana to work from home - they are contributing to the economy through their purchases, their taxes, and need for services.",

I'm not getting into a useless argument about whether rich people driving up prices but not bringing jobs is a good thing(it's not, their need for services means we have even more of a service job economy, which even further widens the gap between those with a lot of money and those with none.) \n\nAs for the assholes who tried to drive you off the road, I am sorry that happened to you, those people should definitely face consequences for that bullshit.",

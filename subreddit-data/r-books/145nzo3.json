I couldn\u2019t visualize the characters at all and felt they had no depth. The writing also felt very middle school. \n\nI guess I\u2019m struggling to understand what the hype is. I\u2019ve been seeing that she\u2019s very popular on TikTok and Instagram, and even has a movie coming out based on one of her books. \n\nAny thoughts or opinions?",

But after giving it some thought as to why I was able to read It Ends With Us and It Starts With Us in the span of 2-3 days, I think that's what makes her books so popular. \n\nIt ignited in me that same drive to keep reading that I used to get from reading fanfiction when I was younger. The writing was very accessible and relatable and not at all deep. I think this appeals to a lot of the general public, and also lets the story take centre stage while the prose kind of turns \"invisible\". The story itself relied on a lot of the drama and tropes that I recognized in fanfiction too, like guy-from-your-past-reappears-in-your-life-all-hot-and-successful, guy-from-your-past-has-longed-for-you-all-this-time, guy-you're-meant-to-be-with-discovers-you're-being-mistreated, hot-guy-saves-you-from-your-bad-boyfriend, you're-pregnant-and-he-helps-you, etc. Stories I used to eat up as a teenager because I may have daydreamed about myself in similar centre-of-attention scenarios or being noticed/rescued by a guy. \n\nTo sum it up, I'm convinced that the books' success is due to its similarity to tropey fanfiction.",

Typically that means books are written in a YA style, but feature adult characters and more adult themes and relationships. \n\nI\u2019ve never been a Colleen Hoover fan, but I can understand why her books do well. You can breeze through them in a day or two. Her writing has the familiarity and comfort that YA does, but doesn\u2019t have to shy away from adult themes. They\u2019re not meant to be literary works of art, more like a hallmark movie",

The result was the first book in the series \"Death in Bloodhound Red\" a fun, well written, mystery with an original voice. Way better than Hoover.

I'm pretty sure there was an article floating around where she herself didn't know why her books were so popular.\n\nI don't really care if her books are trash, but I find it strange that a lot of online critics target her so ferociously.

But, as a bookseller, I appreciate that she has brought droves of people to our store who would  otherwise have never been. It is nice to see people so excited about an author. And a refreshing change from the readers who chew on Overstory or Lincoln in the Bardo or Cloud Cuckoo Land like pretentious twats. CoHo is opening up the world of reading to new people. And I lover her for it.",

The stories dont have big plot twists which make them easy to read specially for new book worms.  Also it worries me seeing young girls reading such books bcs i have seen so many of them saying they love such toxic characters(example Ryle).\n\nBut really booktok reccs arent always the best....",

            "comment": "The people who can relate to the topics she writes about, or have seen others close to them go through similar things as her characters, tend to enjoy her books. The people who have never gone through that kind of stuff (or just struggle with empathy, in the case of some) tend to dislike her books. I really do think it's as simple as that for most people. Books don't have to be super deep or detailed or have outstanding writing in order for the topics to hit home with people. It always bothers me when I see people talking about how they hate Colleen Hoover's characters for being bland or they hate the books because \"that situation just isn't realistic\" or \"they're so dramatic,\" because for a lot of people in this world, those situations ARE real. Obviously, not every person is going to relate to every bit of her books 100%. But I have both experienced and witnessed firsthand the kinds of abuse, trauma, grief, coping mechanisms, fear, isolation, etc. that she writes about. So I'll continue reading and enjoying her books because it's therapeutic for me to read about those things, in a setting far away from me in bookland, where there is a clear relief/ happy ending, because it's therapeutic for me as someone who understands and relates to those topics. You know now that maybe her stuff just isn't for you, and that's okay. It is a good conversation to have with your friends, about the sorts of things you each want to get out of the books you read, so they can recommend stuff that's more your style or just accept that you have different tastes.",

Myself from almost a decade ago enjoyed it because I was the target market of her books and most probably the same as to why she is booming right now. Though a lot of her most well known books now are IMO not her best works, I will not shy away from saying {November 9 by Colleen Hoover} is a great read. Remains my favorite of hers despite having to reread at the present time.",

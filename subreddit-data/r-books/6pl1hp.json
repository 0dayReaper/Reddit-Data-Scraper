The descriptions of the slightly buzzing voices of the replaced teachers and the occasional bulging of their skins as the beetles moved around was so creepy.",

I'm thinking that I might be sampling his wares and if appropriate pass him on to my 9 year old, who's suddenly become a voracious reader with a penchant for the spooky.\n\nSo, thanks!",

I used sleep on the top bunk and there was bulb right over my bed.\n\nSeptember was the month where you'd see a lot of moths. The bulb in itself was very annoying but then September was even worse because it's moth friends would come visit and have some sort of disco party.\n\nOne night, I was reading Goosebumps, hardcover,  in my bed, feeling scared as fuck and as usual the disco moths were there. Closed my book and with all my energy, swung it at this one fatass moth. I heard a thud and I knew it was a home run. It became a whole sport thing where every body would come to my bed and see whose moth fell the furthest.\n\nThere was only 1 rule, only equipent you can use is Goosebumps. The sport was called, Mothbumps.  Hahahhahahhahahha.\n\nEdit: Really wanted to mention this one part. It got really difficult to borrow Goosebumps from the school library. The library was always out for some reason. ",

            "comment": "I'm a writer too. I had the pleasure of meeting RL Stine at StokerCon 2016 in Vegas. The story is pretty funny.\n\nI was super nervous to meet him, and I kinda sorta went out of my way to avoid it the first day of the convention. At one point I was smoking behind the building with Linda Addison and Jack Ketchum, (coincidence, we weren't old pals or anything) and I casually mentioned how I was afraid to talk to Stine. Jack Ketchum basically called me a wimp. (He said it very nice, but the gist was \"Don't be afraid. Tell him what you just told me.\")\n\nSo I work up my nerve and walk up to Stine when I pass him again a few hours later. I get so light headed I think I'm about to fall over, because here I am meeting my childhood hero. I mean, there are a lot of writers I credit for my career, but my love of horror blossoms primarily from his books and my mother's love of B movies. \n\nI tell him that. Well, I sorta tell him that. I speak full on light speed word salad as I turn progressively redder and redder. Here's my childhood hero, and I feel like I'm going to pass out. Worse yet, I know I'm sticking my foot in my mouth. I end it as quickly as possible with, \"Man, I can't believe I'm getting to meet you. I've wanted to since I was a kid, but I never thought I'd actually get the chance. Matter of fact, you're the whole reason I'm here.\"\n\nHe smiles as he shakes my hand, looks me dead in the eyes, and says, \"Don't put that on me.\" Then just walks off like the Fonz. Two seconds later the absurdity of the whole thing catches up with me and I bust out laughing as I walk off. I feel a million times better instantly.\n\nSuper nice guy. Very funny. He also said in his speech during the banquet that when he dies he wants his ashes spread over Scarlet Johansson. Got a laugh out of the whole audience.",

Fear Street will always hold a special place in my heart, but when I want to take a trip back to 1993, Christopher Pike is where it's at. As a 30-something I see now that C.P's YA novels are a shade or two darker and the themes are much more more mature. ",

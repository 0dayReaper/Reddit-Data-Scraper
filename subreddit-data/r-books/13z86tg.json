    "postText": "I searched and didn\u2019t see a thread about David Baldacci\u2019s The 6:20 Man.   My sister was reading the hardcover when I visited at Easter and I pushed a copy to my Paperwhite.   As airport thrillers go, it was pretty good.  I can recommend it as mindless beach reading.   It\u2019s the first of a series and the next one comes out in the fall.  \n\nWithout spoilers, there was a reveal at the end and death of some of the characters that was kind of contrived but it\u2019s an airport thriller.",

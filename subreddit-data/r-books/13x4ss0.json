    "postText": "As the title says, I was rereading The Hunger Games on a whim and was really struck by how nuanced it is. The dystopian commentary feels pretty interesting, the farcical nature of the Capitol is really well realized, and the idea of constant surveillance was explored impressively. The juxtaposition between the barbarism of the Games and the entertainment/drama the spectators get from it is a really complex dynamic for YA fiction, and I think Katniss appealing to sponsors while also trying to survive was really compelling.\n\nAlso, I really liked that the romance aspect of the book was intrinsically tied to the nature of the constant surveillance and necessity for presentation. While I don't have a problem with teen romance, it's often a somewhat shallow topic by nature, and the book did a fantastic job of really deepening the relationship between Peeta and Katniss. The way they 'take turns' strategizing about how best to use their love as a tool to win support while the other is in the dark, the way it juxtaposes with their true feelings, and the contrast between the intensity of the Games and the knowledge that they're constantly being watched all are extremely well-executed and impressive concepts for a YA book.\n\nOverall, I think this book does a fantastic job of melding traditional YA themes with complex dystopian concepts. The reread really made me appreciate the depth that the book offers, and I came away feeling like the book absolutely deserved to have the appreciation and impact that it received. Anyone else feel like the series is miles ahead of other YA dystopian novels in its exploration of deeper themes?",

Well, I didn't really, I think I just forgot about the books.\n\nThat series gave me such vivid images in my mind about those magnetic hoverboards, the old train tracks, that scene where they jump off the building, the dormitories for the uglies, and then that other \"free city\"... oh and also the fireflies...\n\nMan, I'm realizing that I've never had such a vivid experience reading books than the uglies. I might have to jump into it again myself!",

The government doesn't own Boeing, but Boeing is going to fail without government contracts. The government doesn't own Exxon, but Exxon gets to control vast tracts of land dedicated to its industry.\n\nPanem is very likely an exaggeration of what we have today, and what we have today is crony capitalism where capital has amassed so much power that it has wildly disproportionate influence in government. I think that's pretty clearly what's going in The Hunger Games, too -- capitalists have become so powerful that they've essentially become the government and use it to protect their wealth and status. It's the endgame of capitalism transforming into oligarchy.",

I went from \u201ewell, stands to reason their lives are shitty, after society went bust\u201c to \u201enow wait a minute, some people\u2018s lives are pure luxury and leisure\u201c to \u201ethat\u2018s how it already is\u201c.\n\nLuxury for a minority at the expense of everyone else. Law enforcement above the law. Your privacy, your safety, your right to a fair trial, all debatable. The ruling class completely out of touch with reality. Your odds of survival directly correlated with your social status and wealth. Those who have nothing pitted against each other, so they don\u2018t realize who the real enemy is.\n\nWe may stop short of throwing kids into a televised battle to the death, but we don\u2018t give too much of a damn about children dying either. It\u2018s the price we choose to pay, and we shrug and say \u201ethe chances of it being my kid are really low\u201c. Remember that in the book, you can enter your name into the lottery multiple times to get more food vouchers? So the poorer you are, the more the odds are stacked against you. Sound familiar yet?\n\nPanem is divided into districts, but the districts aren\u2018t equal. The districts closer to the Capitol make electronics and weapons, but further down the line it\u2018s food and then wood and coal. Replace district with class, and you\u2018re right where we are. The upper class don\u2018t live a carefree life either, but they\u2018re better off than the ones at the bottom. And it\u2018s in their best interest to make sure the order of things doesn\u2018t get upset, or so they\u2018re made to believe. Which is why in the book we see districts 1 and 2 siding with the Capitol.\n\nThe name Panem isn\u2018t a random choice either. \u201ePanem et circenses\u201c, bread and circus games, was the method the Romans used to keep the poor population content and subservient. We have sports and entertainment, it distracts from the real issues.",

I think this was kind of lost on me when I read the books as a young adult, but I recently rewatched the movies (after my girlfriend went on an impromptu rant similar to your points) and it was seriously disgruntling. I live in New York City and the parallels between my day-to-day life and the Capitol are startling. I mean even New York fashion (which I appreciate) isn\u2019t all too different from the costumes people where in the hunger games. I go on Instagram or walk into my office and everyone is talking about the latest celebrity gossip or what-not, and it\u2019s easy to see how this isn\u2019t any different then everyone in the capitol drooling over the latest bit of gossip Ceaser describes on his talk show. Meanwhile, I read the real news and all of the actual problems our country is facing and I can\u2019t help but feel that we\u2019re willingly distracting ourselves from reality. Many of us New Yorkers (and I fully include myself in this) live in our little bubble unaware or willingly deluded of the reality around us just like the capitol. \n\nI love New York, and it\u2019s certainly not all bad, but I certainly see the similarities. I also don\u2019t think the capitol is strictly meant to be New York, and the same parallels could probably be applied to the wealthy class anywhere in the country. I just live in New York so that\u2019s the lens I have to compare it too.",

            "comment": "I honestly think there is a LOT of good YA dystopia people will dismiss as Hunger Games clones but in reality are great on their own and even have meta commentary on the genre. Iron Widow comes to mind as a recent one with several plot decisions feeling like they were made to directly contrast to THG and the heroine archetype it popularized (the reluctant revolutionary) which was a nice change of pace for the genre.\n\nI love The Chemical Garden trilogy by Lauren DeStefano, it gets a bad rap from people who found the slower more character driven nature of it boring but I love the entire trilogy and honestly found it a rumination on grief and how it shapes your entire life, watching an entire culture rot in the face of imminent extinction. Across The Universe by Beth Revis is a great look at how a cool/horrifying microstate could develop on a generation ship and has lots of sci-fi stuff mixed in but is mainly dystopian, the exploration of the justifications and rhetoric tyrants will tell themselves and nature of coverups, how corrupt hierarchies always have another level of bullshit once you peel away the last one.\n\nMatched by Allie Condie really makes me mad. Everyone remembers it as a love triangle book because that's how the marketing depicts it but I swear there's not even a love triangle. The entire theme is that poetry and literature are threats to fascism and learning to write poetry and read banned books is rebellion and how art can wake you up and open your eyes. Literally everyone who remembers it rips on it for something the marketing insists is there to market to teen girls, but isn't really present in the book. Annoying because I think it's poetic and endearing with themes of censorship and surveillance but people dunk on it for assumed reasons that just don't add up.\n\nThe best one nobody knows about is Defiance by CJ Redwine. That trilogy is the most balls to the wall, action packed, dragon infested dystopian I have encountered. One city state represents brutal misogyny and another is used to explore the idea of punishment, guilt, crime, etc, and did I mention it's dragon infested? The depiction of depression and grief with the character Rachel was also really good. And the action scenes hold up for me on every reread.\n\nUltimately ya dystopian as a genre deserves a little more credit than it gets tbh.",

Not only is the romance between Katniss and Peeta very well-done, but the romance between Katniss and Gale is similarly well-done, as well as the contrasts between Gale and Peeta that echo what Katniss feels and needs at different points in her journey/the story.\n\n&gt;!Also, as heartbreaking as Prim's death was, it was necessary for the story because one of its main points is that the innocent cannot be protected in war. Katniss sacrificed everything to save one innocent person, and caused the entire story to set in motion because of this action, and yet in the end her mission failed because good things cannot survive in a bad world.!&lt; (I'd highly recommend [this](https://www.hypable.com/mockingjay-why-prim-needed-to-die/) analysis.) Here's a quote from it:\n\n&gt;!\"It\u2019s clear from the beginning that Prim doesn\u2019t belong in this world. If anything close to Absolute Truth makes an appearance in the series, it\u2019s Prim. In fact, Prim embodies everything good, innocent, and pure. Peeta is a close second, but still not on the same level as Prim. After all, he is willing to kill other tributes if he must, while Prim can\u2019t let a cat die.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!\"That\u2019s why Katniss volunteering at the Reaping is even more significant. She\u2019s volunteering to save her sister, yes, but symbolically, she\u2019s volunteering to fight for and save everything that\u2019s good.\"!&lt;\n\nThere are many other deeper themes that are explored\u2014the uselessness of material goods in the face of things like life and death; the unfairness of wealth disparity; the impact of even small acts of bravery. It's a complex, timeless package of human truths wrapped in a cloak of YA fiction.",

Every time I read it, I feel like there's so much going on in the depths that I'm just not seeing because I'm so distracted by the action. I feel like other dystopian YA novels that followed it got the trappings and the look but missed the heart.",

I thought book 3, even though it was depressing to read because it didn\u2019t feel like Katniss was a hero anymore, or was doing anything really\u2026 was actually a very good representation about what happens to the figurehead of a rebellion. Katniss had no agency by book 3. She was a prop. And her mental state is in fact very realistic. \n\nBook 3 doesn\u2019t describe a revolution - it all happens unsaid, in the background. We barely see any of it, because Katniss isn\u2019t actually revolting. She\u2019s being used, manipulated, the same way the powers that be are manipulating the districts. And I did feel that book 3 described that quite well. It wasn\u2019t particularly satisfying to read, but it certainly stayed true to the author\u2019s message.",

Though the capitol looked omnipotent compared to the districts, it looks like they may have had enough decadence to stagnate their ability to respond to problems, notwithstanding their direct and century developed processes toward creating the proper game traps.

I would rank it above Harry Potter, because that deals with some of the same themes but I think because of the magic aspect of HP, some of the seriousness of those themes gets lost in the surrealism. HG is raw and brutal. There are some really heartbreaking things that come to light in the last book, things that kids and teens don\u2019t necessarily think about when it comes to totalitarian government, like human trafficking.\n\nKatniss and Peeta are my top favorite couple of all time just because it reminds me of my husband and I so much. They\u2019re personalities, mainly, but just how much they go through and still manage to protect each other and support one another, no matter what they need to do. It\u2019s realistic, even with it\u2019s not so great parts, which is what makes it realistic. He is literally the only person there for her toward the end and it makes such a difference in her personality.\n\nAnd, if you do decide to continue the series, just know that the \u201clove triangle\u201d bullshit, is just that, bullshit. The movies tried to follow the YA trend of a girl having two male lovers but it\u2019s not like that in the books. Katniss is horribly scarred emotionally and mentally and she\u2019s just trying to survive. It\u2019s not until toward the end of the second book she even considers what being in love would be like and it\u2019s all erased once she is hit with more trauma. Katniss\u2019 only concerns are Prim and, in the arena and Capitol, Peeta. But it\u2019s just, what do I have to do to keep everyone safe? Which is a lot for any adult let alone a 16 year old girl. I like that this was Collins\u2019 take on it. Silliness and \u201comg, which boy is cuter?!\u201d has no place in HG.",

Capitol residents are all portrayed as dandyish and effeminate (so, \"gay\") . Meanwhile, the District people are honorable, hardworking country folk with traditional values. I'm OK with right-wing fiction if it's entertaining and not too crazy, so the political subtext didn't bother me, but imo there was no other way to interpret the series as anything but a right-wing fever dream.",

The ostentatious styles of the capitol isn\u2019t supposed to depict them as \u201cliberal\u201d but as decadent as image obsessed\u2026they dont have to be practical and have money to spend and dedicating themselves to trends is a way to show off their wealth and status. \n\nLook at France before the revolution. Men were wearing wigs, heels, and literal make up and beauty marks. It had nothing to do being gay\u2026it was just the style at the time. There was still a literal king. You can\u2019t get more right wing than a literal King lol\u2026even if he\u2019s in makeup and a long wig. Clothes aren\u2019t what makes something left or right wing. The nobles were spending and living lavishly while pedants were starving.\n\nLooking at that as \u201cthe effeminate men are overlording it over us simple traditional folk\u201d is the type of myopic view Fox News exactly does push lol. They get people mad about \u201cthe gays\u201d so they don\u2019t get mad at the actually people in power or the actual problems or the fact that they\u2019re gonna have to go bankrupt over a treatable disease. I\u2019m kinda shocked that\u2019s what you picked up from the book lol \n\nIt\u2019s the power structure and the main players, people like Snow, who control things. And the upper class and bourgeoisie distract themselves with current fashions and material items and media \u201cbread and circus\u201d or Latin \u201cpan et circum\u201d (the literally name of the place is Panem\u201d)\u2026which is exactly mirror our modern society. The work is also heavily influenced from the fall of Rome, which if you\u2019ve studied also correlates closely to what is happening in late capitalism. They lowered taxes on the wealthy, overspent on the military, sold political seats, and income inequality grew vastly. \n\n\nThe working class works for low wages and ignores the fact that our health care is abhorrable so we can keep buying trendy bs and watch reality tv. That\u2019s the whole bread and circus philosophy\u2026we\u2019re kept entertained enough to be exploited. \n\nAnyways, if you even have to wonder about the actual intent of the author than she\u2019s not shy about her political leanings and is blatantly left. A quick visit to her Twitter shows that as well.",

I know Collins is supposedly leftist but she seems to have taken the deranged paranoid fantasies of Fox News MAGA types and used them for world-building for the series. The average trailer-dwelling Trumper is not going to be familiar with the nuances of French and Roman history. They see the world as it is in the Hunger Games \u2014 the US is dominated by the wealthy effeminate urban elite who oppress/destroy the culture of the rural traditional-values types who do all the \"real\" work, take their guns away, don't let them hunt, keep them poor etc. This series was made for them and their sympathizers, regardless of whatever Collins pretends to be. Guess we'll have to agree to disagree.",

Some people assumed that Brown wrote his book similarly either to even get published or the publisher pressured the similar theme. As the second book way different going forward. \n\nI kind of shrugged off Hunger Games as I'll admit the movie I saw kinda killed the desire but the basic premise just seems so very simple and unimportant to me.

One thing that really struck me when I first picked it up again as an adult is how carefully Katniss\u2019 trauma responses are written. They feel so real because she\u2019s not aware of them as they\u2019re happening. She just ACTS. You can see it happening in the arena, but it\u2019s major when she gets out. She gets triggered during an interview at the end and immediately hides her face in Peeta\u2019s shirt. Beginning of the book Katniss wouldn\u2019t be caught dead showing something like that. But in the moment she just does it and then mentions that it takes them a few minutes to coax her back out. Just says it like that\u2019s normal. She doesn\u2019t even question it. \n\nShe\u2019s constantly trying to figure out her feelings, his feelings, how she should act to keep them safe, but with a treacherous body that acts how it wants to at the same time. She\u2019s lucky that what her body did on instinct was things like \u201ccling to Peeta and don\u2019t let go.\u201d Idk I just love how you can see the slow breakdown of her usual behaviors in the face of this huge ongoing traumatic event and how it affects her in the aftermath without the author ever actually pointing it out. I feel like a lot of authors would feel the need to lampshade it or have the character question their actions to make sure the audience picks up on it, but in real life most people don\u2019t notice their trauma responses while they\u2019re doing them. Suzanne Collins trusted the audience to pick up on it anyway",

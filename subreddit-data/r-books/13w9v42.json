    "postText": "I speak English since I was a kid and consider myself 80-90% fluent in English. I struggle with making long sentences but I understand 100% when someone else is speaking. \n\nSo, I watched the movie Lolita years ago and I couldn't wait to read the book after reading the positive reviews. But oh man.. One page is taking me 7 to 10 minutes to read. The sentences are way too complex. I keep coming across words which I've never read before which I have to look online to decipher the meaning of them lol\n\n. Can someone else relate? Is it a 'me' problem?",

He also had the condition called synesthesia, and his writing often reflected that, with words and sounds having colors for example. Knowing this might make some of his unusual word choices seem more understandable.",

I think you've either never read the novel, or that you did, but didn't understand the literary device of the unreliable narrator. Depiction is not endorsement, and literature is allowed to make us uncomfortable. The novel is supposed to be disturbing, it's a story narrated by an unreliable, self serving monster who destroys a young girl. Nabokov was molested as a child, and Lolita was an attempt to understand the mindset and rationalization of a pedophile. He interviewed pedophiles in prison while researching the novel, and did his best to make sure that you understand that Humbert is a monster and that Delores is his victim. Did you think that it was a real story, told by the author based on his own experience? That's the only way I could conceive that you'd think Nabokov was gross.",

My daughter's and my taste and smell colors are similar but not identical. Think of it like grape soda tastes purple, not like grape. But green grapes taste white. A chest infection smell like puce but baby sick breath is chartreuse. And some scents or tastes can be mixed, like burnt umber mixed with a dark pumpkin orange. People think we are nuts sometimes.",

One of the great characters of the 20th century. Lolita is a joy to read, so worth it.\n\nhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/119456/the-annotated-lolita-by-vladimir-nabokov/",

And I shall tell you why. When we read a book for the first time the very process of laboriously moving our eyes from left to right, line after line, page after page, this complicated physical work upon the book, the very process of learning in terms of space and time what the book is about, this stands between us and artistic appreciation. When we look at a painting we do no have to move our eyes in a special way even if, as in a book, the picture contains elements of depth and development. The element of time does not really enter in a first contact with a painting. In reading a book, we must have time to acquaint ourselves with it. We have no physical organ (as we have the eye in regard to a painting) that takes in the whole picture and can enjoy its details. But at a second, or third, or fourth reading we do, in a sense, behave towards a book as we do towards a painting. However, let us not confuse the physical eye, that monstrous achievement of evolution, with the mind, an even more monstrous achievement. A book, no matter what it is - a work of fiction or a work of science (the boundary line between the two is not as clear as is generally believed) - a book of fiction appeals first of all to the mind. The mind, the brain, the top of the tingling spine, is, or should be, the only instrument used upon a book.\u201d",

Some authors are praised as challenging while they\u2019re actually pretty easy as long as you\u2019re somewhat well read or used to reading actual books. Cormac McCarthy\u2019s is one of those authors, I think. Beautiful, beautiful prose, but it\u2019s not complex, just somewhat archaic in tone.\n\nThen again some authors are justifiably known as difficult. Pynchon\u2019s work sounds amazing in theory but actually delving into it is scary because he\u2019s established as a complex one. This is also why I\u2019m still prolonging on reading even his super short book *The Crying of a Lot 49*.\n\nAlso it honestly weirds me out that this is the first time in my life I\u2019ve heard of *Lolita* being complex, and that probably stems from a fact that generally most people have read *Lolita* in their native language and not in english. Translations tend to kill the prose and make the text simpler.",

Only author I can imagine that would be harder is Joyce. I'm amusing myself now by trying to imagine like a French translation of *Finnegan's Wake*.\n\nSo yes, I imagine Nabokov in another language feels less complex because some of the density has had to be sacrificed.",

He translated \"milk bar\" but didn't give its meaning. There is no such term in russian, so reader won't understand what Nabokov meant. There is a term \"paper chase\" which was left without translation, just as russian transcription. Russian-speaking reader has no chance to understand it. \n\nHe mentions \"Reader's Digest\" magazine, but doesn't translate it at all, leaving enlglish words and doesn't mention that it is a name of the magazine. At the same time, Nabokov uses term \"blue jeans\" which was already known to the people in USSR, but Nabokov translates it as \"cowboy pants\". Popcorn became \"fried corn seeds\". Also he used 16 words to describe a \"football cheerleader\"",

            "comment": "Imagine you're a novice guitarist, you've learned your chords, you've strummed your way through 'Wonderwall' and you're feeling pretty proud. Then someone hands you sheet music for a Van Halen solo and says, \"Off you go, champ.\" Well, my friend, that's what it's like diving into 'Lolita' when English isn't your first language.\n\nNabokov isn't just strumming chords here; he's riffing, bending strings, and playing with a slide all at once. This isn't a garage band novel; it's a symphony of words.\n\nNow, think of it this way: if life is a maze, then language is a maze within that maze. Words aren't just bricks to build a wall; they're the brushstrokes of an abstract painting. And when you read 'Lolita', you aren't just navigating a maze, you're stepping into a whole different universe of language. And in this universe, every sentence is a riddle, and every paragraph is a puzzle box.\n\nWords you've never seen before? Welcome to Nabokov's playground. The man was a master of language, a lexical acrobat. Like a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat, he draws out words from his linguistic hat that you and I didn't even know existed. But that's the beauty of it. You're not just reading; you're learning. You're exploring. You're growing.\n\nStruggling with long sentences? Remember, sentences are not just words thrown together, they're thoughts stitched with words. So take your time. Unravel them slowly. Sometimes, you have to take a moment, step back, and just let the words wash over you. Like slowly savoring a fine wine or a rich chocolate truffle.\n\nYou aren't alone, my friend. Many English-first language readers have struggled too. Nabokov's prose isn't just complex; it's intricate, nuanced, and almost musical. Like a linguistic ballet.\n\nSo is it a 'you' problem? No. It's a 'Nabokov' challenge. It's a dance with words, and sometimes, the dance steps can be complex. But hey, isn't that what makes the dance worth it? So, put on your dancing shoes, and dance along. And remember, stumbling is part of the dance.",

                    "comment": "That's a really good analogy actually. To extend it further, ever since Hemmingway we have become accustomed to a really stripped down, understated form of prose where the writing \"does what it says on the tin\" so to speak - the prose serves the story and consciously tries not to get in the way . The 12-bar Blues of writing. If that's your accustomed paradigm of prose style, jumping from the 12-bar Blues to maximalist Death Metal Everything-all-at-once, assault-on-the-senses, all-guns-blazing baroque style where the meaning is hidden behind layers of allusion, linguistic in-jokes, perspective-shifts and so on - it's going to be disorientating and alienating. \n\nNobody goes from reading straightforward linear narratives to something like Borges, Nabokov, Umberto Eco, David Foster Wallace, Thomas Pynchon, Gene Wolfe and so on without difficulty because you have to come to terms with the fact that the text is fucking with you in ways that might take 3 reads through to grasp. It's rewarding when you do, but it's a different paradigm to the \"verse-chorus-verse\" structure",

Both of those gentlemen are regarded as some of the best stylists in 20th-century English literature. \n\nI think it likely that is the very fact that English isn't their cradle tongue that helped them come up with novel and engaging styles.

If you have a source material that is loved for the things it does.. why change it to something different then? Same is happening with Witcher adaptation at the moment. Same happened to Eragon, Last Airbender, Dark Tower, obviously to Percy.. did it work out anytime? Is it more uncommon to movies follow the books and be not well liked by general public and books fans? Harry Potter (even despite some changes) followed the books if it could and people love it. GoT started with following the books and it is regarded as one of the best shows with best writing so far.\n\nSo.. why change it? Obviously studios wants to earn money, but why burn it on an abomination to make a quick cheap buck that will give you less even in a short time? Let alone in a long time when you could be milking it with more movies and merchendise.. so.. why?",

                            "comment": "Hollywood studios *absolutely will not* allow one of their films to go without a romantic subplot for the protagonist.\n\nI wrote a treatment for a Lovecraftian horror movie years ago.  It was one of the best ideas I came up with at the time.  I showed it to my creative partner.  He said, \u201cGreat!  All you need is a love story in it.\u201d\n\nI was flabbergasted.  It was a horror movie, and the movie had nothing to do with themes of romance.  I balked at the suggestion of including a love story in the film, and the project fizzled out.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t know at the time, and the reason why I was wrong rather than my partner, is that Hollywood studios make movies that they believe appeal to the four quadrants.  Those four quadrants are men, women, young, and old.  A script has to seem appealing to all four of those groups for a Hollywood studio to be willing to make it.\n\nOne of the problems of Hollywood, though, is that they think all they have to do is add a romantic subplot to the film in order to appeal to women.  Not female leads.  Not films created and crewed by women.  Not films dealing with the issues of women.  Just a plot line in which a woman falls in love with a man, and that man falls in love with her.\n\nThis even applies to sequels.  In most movies, they end by having the guy get the girl for a happy ending.  But watch the sequels to those movies.  What happens most of the time is that the guy and girl break up so that the sequel can once again have a romantic subplot for the lead.\n\nSome sequels are somewhat clever about this.  \u201cThe Mask of Zorro\u201d ends with Zorro and Elena married and with a child.  It\u2019s sequel, \u201cThe Legend of Zorro,\u201d shows that their marriage is on the rocks.  It even becomes a plot point as Elena separates from Zorro so she can act as a spy against the villain, which is clever.  Nevertheless, the reason why it happened is so that the guy and girl are forced to relive their romance for the sake of the four quadrants.\n\nAn absolutely not clever example is \u201cMagic Mike XXL.\u201d  In \u201cMagic Mike,\u201d the hero gets the girl.  By the beginning of the sequel, he has broken up with her.  The reason why is so that at the end of the sequel, he has romanced a different girl.\n\nOf all the films made in Hollywood, very few do not have a romantic subplot for the hero.  One of the few films that don\u2019t have a romantic subplot is \u201cBeverly Hills Cop.\u201d\n\nWhen \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d was first in development, Sylvester Stallone was originally attached to play Axel Foley, and a romantic subplot was written into that original script.  However, Stallone wanted it to be an edgy, violent action movie rather than a comedy.  The producers disagreed and Stallone left the film.\n\nStallone made his edgy, violent action movie.  We know it today as \u201cCobra.\u201d  And the producers of \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d got their comedy.  They casted Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley.\n\nHowever, \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d lost its romantic subplot.  The reason why that movie lost its romantic subplot is because the character who was supposed to be the love interest was Jenny.  And Jenny was played by a white actress.  And the hero of the film was now a black man.\n\nSo rather than keep the romantic subplot in which a black man winds up with a white woman, they decided to take out the romantic subplot and instead have the two characters be platonic friends since childhood.\n\nSo all this tells you what the priorities of Hollywood studios are when it comes to romance in their films.",

The point is, even if it hurts the second act of your perfect but mysteriously unsold movie about a time-travelling assassin, you\u2019ve got to put a love story in your script.\u201d\n\nAs someone who\u2019s made movies, I know you can do a movie without a romance subplot. You do have to show that you can attract that quadrant without having a love story, though, which was surprisingly easy. All we said was \u201cNicole\u2019s hot. George\u2019s hot. We don\u2019t need anymore than that to sell the movie.\u201d",

I always felt like there's something missing there to give Jason the weight he's supposed to have as a character, and more Reyna is of course always a good thing.!&lt;\n* I hope we get a Magnus Chase spin-off eventually, need more Alex Fierro in my life.\n\nedit: spoiler formatting",

Like you said he's too much like Percy but isn't as fun. Maybe it was done on purpose to emphasize Jason's \"Roman-ness\"\n\nAlso, unlike the other characters it never feels like Jason ever goes on a personal journey during their quest. Even side-characters like Nico and Reyna have their own personal journey but somehow Jason just feels there and that's why he ends up feeling more like a plot-device than an actual character.",

Possibly the only compelling part of Jason, his relationship with Thalia and his familial issues with his mother, gets brushed aside with a quick meeting in The Lost Hero or in the opening chapter of Blood of Olympus. \n\nMaybe it was an intentional design choice to make it clear that Jason was letting go of his past to embrace his new (Greek) present, but it just ended up with the reader never really having any kind of emotional struggle to bond with Jason over, like you described.",

That could work with someone established like Percy or Annabeth, but not the new guy.\n\nEven Percy, who has five books dedicated to him, is getting more character development. We see that while Percy still doesn't agree with Luke he does understand him much better than he did in the original series where Percy still had a more black and white view of the world. House of Hades is essentially tear-down of Percy as he has to confront his own sins.",

            "comment": "Woah Disney will finally get its first gay character, Nico di Angelo???? Again?\n\nEdit: there's a big ass comment thread. To be fair I was poking fun at the fact that [\"Onward\"](https://www.pride.com/movies/2020/2/21/pixars-onward-introduces-disneys-first-openly-gay-character) was proclaimed to have Disney's first gay character but just two years ago [LeFou](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/news/beauty-beast-disneys-first-ever-gay-character-is-lefou-voiced-by-josh-gad-981928) was? That year [a teenager in one of their shows](https://www.google.com/amp/s/deadline.com/2017/10/disney-channel-andi-mack-character-come-out-gay-1202194584/amp/) came out and was one of Disney's \"firsts.\"  But in 2014 [Disney had its first gay mom](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ew.com/article/2014/01/28/disney-channel-features-its-first-gay-couple-on-good-luck-charlie-video/%3famp=true). They've definitely humble bragged and stirred up this idea they're somehow super progressive and amazing for having their first gay character once or twice year despite it always being a crumb of representation (and not always good rep). While it's amazing that the largest children's media maker is making queer characters and that's historically important for several reasons.... they're one of the last children's networks to work on it. Meanwhile Nickelodeon showed its [definitely and explicitly queer couple ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-jun-18-et-howard18-story.html%3f_amp=true) in 2002.... then they went on to have [Legend of Korra](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/12/legend-of-korra-creators-confirm-korrasami-is-canon/amp) end and confirm Nick's first lesbian couple, even if there's no kiss... Cartoon Network has had huge main characters in shows like Steven Universe with explicitly, loving, realistic queer couples. \n\nPassive representation of gay parents has been around and there have been many, many, many messy and implied gay characters in the past -- especially by Disney. Since Disney launched its had a complicated relationship with queer media, mostly because they nearly always [queer-code](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/news/amp21506/disney-gay-lgbt-characters-history/) their [villians](http://www.newnownext.com/disney-queer-coded-animated-villains/07/2019/) and haven't found its footing until recently. Polygon has an excellent [article ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.polygon.com/platform/amp/2020/3/6/21167960/onward-gay-character-pixar-disney-lgbtq) explaining why they're still pretty far behind other children's media (books and other). \n\nYes it is great they're including LGBT+ characters. Yes I hope they include Nico's gay angst in the show, even if he isn't explicitly out until book four of Hero's of Olympus... that would be pretty cool I think\n\nI know no one asked for my input but I figured it's interesting to learn anyways :^)",

The movies were an abomination to not only the books but decent filmmaking in general and book adaptations rarely get a good second chance if the first try doesn't take. \n\n 3. A tv show is much better suited for how much story is packed into those books and each book could be an entire season, and it opens the door for the other series by Riordan to get adapted.\n\n 4. I really hope they use some of the special effects innovations Disney/Star Wars created for Mandolorian. \n\nGoddamn this has so much potential I'm so excited.",

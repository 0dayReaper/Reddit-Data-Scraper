    "postText": "I'm baffled at how this book is not very widely read. I started off reading short stories by picking up Jhumpa Lahiri's work but for some reason, it felt more like toil than pleasure despite the great writing. I thought short stories were just not for me until I read Shoko's Smile. What a great, great work of literature! \n\nI went in thinking that it would be a fun little read but ended up awestruck by the creative genius and how such simple language spun a web of such complicated emotions. It ended up becoming one of my biggest literary inspirations and I really hope the author releases more of her work soon.",

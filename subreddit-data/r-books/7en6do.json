Text \"resist\" to \"504-09\" and it'll ask you some questions, then you're onto writing. From another thread a few weeks ago, someone posted this message, and it think it's a great one to send. \n\n\"Net Neutrality is the cornerstone of innovation, free speech and democracy on the Internet.\n\nControl over the Internet should remain in the hands of the people who use it every day. The ability to share information without impediment is critical to the progression of technology, science, small business, and culture. \n\nPlease stand with the public by protecting Net Neutrality once and for all.\"\n\nI'd love to credit the user, but have lost the comment, but please, go send some faxes, show your politicians you want net neutrality to stay.\n\n* Share away! Seriously only takes a few minutes of your time.. You can also find this Bot on Facebook Messenger \"ResistBot\"",

I updated the image myself (sorry if bad etiquette :( ). It wasn't there originally and I agreed that it didn't illustrate well that the cost would likely be more. As someone pointed out though, the point is the control they would have, not just the cost as it's illustrated here. Things could work in a number of horrifying ways. ",

Major carriers are known to collaborate on certain matters. If they want to kill off a certain site/app/service, either by blocking it or making the fees unfair, they could. What happens if they collaborate to take down a major service to fill the void with one they're all invested in (or that \"extended family\" is invested in, to avoid the spotlight).",

They're divided geographically and where they overlap they try to reach an equilibrium. No one carrier is better than the other (if you even have a choice). Competition is good for consumers, but bad for business (them). There are so few carriers (there are lots of piggy-backs that don't own anything) that they all just circle jerk each other. No new companies can be created because it is too difficult to enter the market (e.g., infrastructure costs, maybe some policy/politicians that have their hands in the ISP pocket making it harder too). It takes a company like Google to push something like google fiber, and I'm sure they'll tell you that its an uphill battle even for them.   \nWhile not technically a 'monopoly'. It's pretty darn close. The last thing they need is a way to make more money off consumers (or businesses)   \nIf I knew that new ISPs could come in and steal business away if the current ones pushed things too far, I wouldn't be worried. That's a major part of the problem though. You don't get new carriers. There is no competition. Net Neutrality is one of the only things holding back what is essentially a runaway freight train.   \nThinking about that now, that's probably why they're doing this. Their profits are probably plateauing and the only way to make even more money would be to either milk people/businesses or actually try competing with each other. ",

If you pay for X bandwidth, you can then access all of the internet at that bandwidth.\nRemoving Net Neutrality will do absolutely nothing to make the telco industry a \"free market\". It will only allow the big telcos to take full advantage of their monopolies.  It was only made \"political\" when politicians started lying about what it is and isn't, and convincing gullible people that the way the internet has worked since its inception wasn't in their interests.\"\n\nWell said DarraignTheSane.",

Comcast makes Netflix slow = people ditch Comcast for MonkeyBrains, Fiber, SnootyLoo, Blabiblah, which are now able to build infrastructure.\n\nFrom what I understand, the root of the problem is that the government is in bed with big ISPs to create monopolies, not that we need regulations on how big ISPs serve content.\n\n",

Considering that VPNs add the overhead of TLS/SSL encryption, you would have expected the throughput to be significantly *worse* using a VPN. This implicitly demonstrated that these companies were discriminating against certain traffic flows (because if the lack of 'throughput' was actually real, it would have still been demonstrable using the VPN - or they just can't properly configure rate-shaping).\n\nI work at a company that manufactures full-proxy network intelligence devices and trust me, its trivial to do a lot of shady shit to people's internet. A good example is that its pretty trivial to determine if a customer is attempting to visit speedtest.net and let them go full-speed, yet throttle access to anything else. How would you know your 'real' throughput then?",

Additionally, it ignores the impact that cord cutting from increased competition via streaming services has had on companies like Comcast and Time Warner. Net neutrality preserved the environment necessary for competition to develop in the marketplace and it has been a massive boon for consumers. Without it, telecom giants will be permitted to stifle innovation with impunity whenever some entrepreneur threatens their business model.\n\nTurning the tables on your devil\u2019s advocacy, if net neutrality changed nothing and telecoms just wanted to go back to the status quo, then why would 5ey care about repealing it in the first place?",

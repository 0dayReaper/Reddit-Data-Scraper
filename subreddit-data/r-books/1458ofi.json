Well written and reads very quickly. Flew through this in a few sittings. Basically an action packed story of how one man connects his soldier supporting neighborhood with their friends and loved ones serving in Vietnam. Amazing adventure and a touching perspective of a very nightmar-ish(??) and severely unpopular war. This book was an incredible true story that showcased an honorable man larger than life. His unselfishness and sacrifice to bring warm wishes and love to friends and neighbors serving in Vietnam was nothing short of heroic and insanely admirable. His message sharing journey turned into a mission of survival and great risk to help and protect numerous people around him. Simply an inspiring and superb piece of Vietnam war history.\n\nAbsolutely recommended!",

It is unbelievable what an incredible life Donohue lead!  The more I learned, the more amazed I was!  I did not think the writing was all that great but the story more than made up for it.  So glad you posted about it!",

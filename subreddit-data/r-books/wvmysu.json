    "postText": "I'm a lifelong reader and lover of bookstores. When I'm out with my wife and she's shopping at a seemingly endless stream of clothing stores, I find the nearest bookstore I can -- which isn't always easy -- and lose myself in the stacks. I also buy a lot of books, a dozen since July on Amazon alone. So I have a pretty keen sensitivity when it comes to relative pricing. \n\nI'd like to buy more books from brick and mortars, but the business model for physical bookstores just isn't feasible anymore. They rarely have what I'm looking for in stock, and when they do it's often more than double the price I can find for the same book online. The store can often order the book for me, but their delivery times are often longer than it takes me to get a book delivered to my own house, which is at times under 24 hours -- with free shipping. \n\nI love bookstores and will be sad to see them go. I'll miss them when they're gone. But they don't have much time left.",

Well established Barnes and Nobles are closing, leaving even more communities as book deserts. Yes they may have libraries (I am a librarian and fully support them), but book ownership is an important part of literacy too. So is the presence of bookstores as community institutions. They often provide refuge in a way other stores dont- come in! Read! Have a coffee! Ask about any topic you're interested in! None of that Amazon offers, and it is stripping it away.",

They sent me a replacement copy, and what do you know, it was also full of writing. I ended up just having to buy a copy at HPB.\n\nTheir stickers were also damaging the books and peeling up sections of the cover.\n\nI threw in the towel and just started buying off of ebay, either from individual sellers where I can at least see pictures, or from ebay stores that have good deals (second.sale has been my go-to), which usually ends up being cheaper and more reliable than thriftbooks anyway.\n\n/endrant",

I suspect he's comparing hardback on one site to paperback on the other or some other apples to oranges comparison, as there is no way that B&amp;N is selling a popular mass market paperback at 2x the list price.",

The cost for the retailer is about $5.00-$6.00. You could sell it for $8.00, especially if it's inventory you want to turn over. So I don't know where $17.99 comes from with OP. I agree, pricing with Amazon is similar.\n\nIn fact, the place where I used to work had to stop buying most supplies from Amazon because they just got too expensive. If it was Amazon's mission at one time, I don't think low prices is a goal any longer. I think people need to be more wary about supporting a monopoly and forget about the price difference they saw for \"Killing Floor\" one time.",

One aspect that stuck out for me was in places outside North America, a McDonald's would move in with extremely low prices to push out the local businesses; then once they succeeded, they would increase their prices. I never forgot that, and it's one of the reasons I choose not to support companies like Amazon.

Come into town, open multiple stores to oversaturate the area while claiming you're going to boost the local economy with jobs and reduced prices on goods, then once you've driven the local businesses out, close down the extra stores and drive wages down. \n\nOnce wages go down to the bare minimum legally required, the lower prices are no longer a **benefit** of shopping at Walmart versus local, it becomes the reason why people **can't** shop anywhere else. They can't afford the competition and potential competitors can't survive on the thin profit margins Walmart can, so they don't come back.",

They are effectively killing the mom and pops and even the few national bookstore chains. And op explains quite succinctly why. Most of us just want the lowest price and don\u2019t care how they get it.\n\nI don\u2019t buy from Amazon anymore. I don\u2019t approve of how they treat their employees. I don\u2019t approve of how they let scammers sell fake shit.  I don\u2019t want to live in a society that doesn\u2019t have independent bookstores. So I patronize them and I shun Amazon.",

And having a walk-in caf\u00e9 integrated into a bookstore, or a line-up of magazines in 20 different languages most people wouldn't ever need, is a change I for one welcome very much. Others look at those books and mags just to get looks from other people, but that doesn't mean you couldn't read them in earnest, which is what I do, and it's very much worth it.",

You\u2019d be helping the library as well as other patrons. I do that a lot! I have a secondhand kindle but I do not buy kindle books. I download from my library. I shop for some things at Amazon, but rarely books. I just don\u2019t support them in that endeavor. TBH I really only buy things on Amazon that I expect I may need to return, like clothes or shoes, because F Amazon, really. \n\nTL;DR they haven\u2019t taken down independent bookstores, and they won\u2019t.

Amazon isn\u2019t going to give you that. Yes, the price difference you describe is pretty drastic, but that\u2019s not my experience and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s typical.

Most indie bookstores price their books at list cost, which means the price printed on the cover of the book. I don't know of any stores that price higher than that. Some stores like B&amp;N can price lower because they're a bigger volume store or the books are used. The price you're seeing on Amazon might be a different format than the format you're looking at in store (mass market paperbound vs. traditional paperback vs. hardcover).\n\nIf you actually want to support bookstores then I highly recommend looking through some of the used book links below or at [bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org). They support independent bookstores, can offer lower than list prices, and ship directly to you just like Amazon, but again the money goes to indie bookstores instead of Jeff Bezos.",

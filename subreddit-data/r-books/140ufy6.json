Being from the Central Valley I loved how the landscape became majestic. I loved how we saw perspectives of so many characters. Charles, Tom, Samuel, Lee and Cal were my favorites. \n\nI laughed. I cried. I loved. I used to think the great gatsby was the great American novel. \n\nTimshel!!!!",

They wanted him to wield his considerable influence to reestablish a formula for literature that would come from American authors.\n\nThe goal of this program was to establish an affirmed US literary culture which would rise in influence. Specifically, it was made to create literature that was more grounded in feelings of individualism, personal revelations, \"write from experience\", and the like. Politics, especially those associated with Communist sympathies, support for unions and civil rights, etc., were discouraged. This is why there's such a stark shift in the sympathies of the main characters between The Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden. One is pre- and one is post-CIA Steinbeck. \n\nFor more on this I recommend the Citations Needed podcast episode \"How the Cold War Shaped First-Person Journalism and Literary Conventions\" or google \"CIA + Iowa Writer's Workshop\" for any number of write-ups on the subject.",

But propaganda is not inherently bad, it depends on the message, and the message of The Moon is Down is beautiful.  He wrote it during the opening of WW2 as call to resistance against the Nazi occupation. A printing house that worked with the French Resistance helped translate it into over 70 languages and spread it all over occupied Europe.  \n\nAnd IMO there are few more stirring odes the uncrushable human spirit of a free people in the face of invasion, tyranny, and oppression.  It functions both as a philosophical foundation for the justness of resistance, both passive and violent, as well as a fairly practical how to of waging guerrilla warfare against an occupying force by a civilian population.   Steinbeck was awarded metals by both the French and Norwegian resistance after the war.",

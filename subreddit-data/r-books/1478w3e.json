    "postText": "Hi, all,\n\nRecently I was looking for some new audiobooks when I found a free one on Audible called \"Camp Cacophony\". It's very short. a bit over 60 minutes, yet it was very funny, and very interesting. If you have Audible, check it out. It sort of reminded me a little bit of Morrigan Crow and the Nevermoor series, although I will say it's nowhere near as intense. I found it to be an entertaining and imaginative listen. Just thought I'd recommend it. A few minutes ago I discovered there are a couple of others in this series. Yay!\n\nHope to see you all back in a couple of days.",

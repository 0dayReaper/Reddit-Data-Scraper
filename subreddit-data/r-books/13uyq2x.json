    "postText": "I used to love fantasy books as a kid, but when I became a teen all the books at my reading level started to become filled with romance. I mean books that on the blurb mention a fantasy story, when in reality the plot is replaced by romantic pursuits halfway through..\n\nIt's probably why after a while I switched to sci fi, which seemed to have less of this problem, but I just got bored of it eventually.\n\nNow I want to get back into reading fantasy but face the same issue.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this? Or maybe other people don't mind, that could be why it's so prevelant.\n\nEdit: not all. I have not read every book to exist. Most I've seen are like this tho.",

Just saying, I\u2019ve seen people complain about this while picking up books clearly marketed as romantic fantasy. If not, you have to realize that romance is the top-selling genre. Publishers are going to want to select books that have that cross-genre appeal to widen the potential audience.",

I thought, if I wanted relationship drama, I could just listen to people at school. \"But romance is fundamental to the human experience\" Ok but is it really \\*that\\* fundamental that it has to appear in every book? Can we have some variety in here? I don't mind it if it's actually done well, but a lot of the time it's not. That being said, there are plenty of books without romance, you just have to look a bit harder for them.",

For example, you would expect romantic considerations to drive parts of why characters interact with each other in certain ways, even if they don't end up romancing each other.

The person I responded to said \"is romance really *that* fundamental that it has to appear in every book?\" and I would say yeah, it pretty much is, lol. Like it doesn't have to appear in literally every book...but you should go into any given book expecting it to appear, and if it didn't appear you'd assume it would be because the author made a conscious decision to ignore it. Like, even just \"ooh, this character intimidates me because they're someone I kinda want to impress because they're attractive\" counts.",

And love scenes don't really do anything for me). And this isn't new for me, either. \n\n\n\n\nI remember once in like, third grade, we were reading out loud in class. I forget what the book was, but when my turn came I had to read a part where some bully was freaking out because somebody was making moves on his girlfriend and I just couldn't do it (and the teacher knew I could read, I was reading full on novels at that point...  I even did a book report on Needful Things that year).\n\n\n\n\nI guess I kinda went on a tangent there. The unfortunate thing is that romance sells, and opens books up to other demographics.

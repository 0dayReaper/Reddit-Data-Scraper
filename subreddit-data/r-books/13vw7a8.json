    "postText": "Donna Tartt is undoubtedly one of the most well-renowned and talented writers of this generation. However, all I see is praise for only two of her books, The Goldfinch and The Secret History. I happened to find The Little Friend in Barnes &amp; Noble and give it a go- and honestly, despite popular belief, I thought the book was great. \n\nIt's a grim coming-of-age story set in Mississippi revolving around a girl, Harriet, who sets off with her friend to discover who murdered her brother Robin 12 years ago, who's death left a marked impact on their family. Throughout the story, the narrative switches between her and Danny, a notorious man part of a crime and drug dealing family and who she accuses to be Robin's murderer. Out of her three books, in my opinion, The Little Friend best executes the theme of the discovery of evil and loss of innocence. \n\nThe gradual shift from a kid detective murder-mystery to a bleak, thriller-like novel was astounding. Donna Tartt almost tests our own prejudices by seeing how like Harriet, we assign the guilt of Robin's murder to Danny simply because it makes sense for him to be Robin's murderer, later revealing that he was only a friend of Robin. In a way, Danny and Robin play as a foil for each other- Robin, who was more likely to have led a promising future with loving family and friends, dies- meanwhile Danny, who was abused by his father and raised in a crime filled family is spared by death. The constant subversion of expectations shows Harriet the real, unpredictable chaos that life actually is. She is forced to wake up out of her childlike adventure fantasies and realize- she is not a Sherlock Holmes where she solves the mystery, and the bad guys receive their respective punishment- but in a world where loss is painfully cruel and real, and when a tumble of depressing events pour down on her as she grows up, she is forced to break out of her naive view of the world. \n\nOverall, The Little Friend was a thrilling read and I believe it deserves to be held in somewhat the same regard as her other books. The murder of Robin which captivates Harriet to set off in an adventure, and the gradual hopelessness of her situation as she grows up, were written beautifully by Donna Tartt and should have better recognition.",

            "comment": "They are all great, but I think the Goldfinch is naturally an easier sell. An art heist story that takes place in a museum and cities that millions have visited is more accessible than one year in Mississippi. I lived in east MS from age 8-10 and found it incredibly on point. The poverty, religious zeal, class and racial divides, the poisonous snakes. Especially the snakes. It is a great read but I still don\u2019t know what to think about the ending. Her other two books felt so much more wrapped up, I admit I felt a little dissatisfied with the end of the Little Friend. Still in my top 20 best books though.",

I don't remember the exact contents as I read the book a while back, but I was disappointed that it was Boris instead of Theo who would handle everything with the painting and return it back to the museum. He would just end up being like his father- running away from his problems instead of confronting them face-front. \n\nI agree the ending of The Little Friend was a tad anti-climatic, but it is understandable that Robin's murderer was never revealed, because the point was to show that even if Harriet found who did it, it won't fix everything- a solved murder is still a tragedy. \n\nEven so, with the last pages of the book with the conversation between Pem and Hely, I felt it was kind of teased that Pem was involved in the murder.",

Then it sort of... meandered in the middle, then suddenly picked up again with a very dramatic ending. \n\nBasically, she's clearly a great writer, but are her other books paced a bit better?",

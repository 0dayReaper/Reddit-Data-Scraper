I honestly think that if you give your kid a game with lots of dialogue and math involved it can really help them developmentally. Also, games like pokemon (and other franchises, too) have books and graphic novels to go along with them which will broaden their minds even more. I seriously attribute a lot of my ability to read so well to just *having* to read in order to play all the games that the older kids played.  ",

Looking back, practice was practice.\n\nI also used something similar to what you are doing with your stepson on myself.

For instance, I'd be grounded until I read a Louis L-Amour Western book from the 50's/60's. As you can imagine, I did not enjoy reading very much growing up. \n\n\nSo yeah...

I loved it and ultimately the game ended up being the reason I'm now a full time software developer at the age where my friends are still in their early years of college. I wanted to make mods for it and so I learned how and put out a nice little mod a while later that actually had a couple users. Last time I checked, the latest version had over 1,000 downloads and the older versions were up around that count too. \n\nI eventually got into game development and spent **years** chasing after my dream of creating a Minecraft clone. Still hasn't happened because I suck at math, but I learned so much. All of it stemming from Minecraft. Now I make a living as a software developer. \n\nBut, my little brother. He was around 6-7 years old at the time I found Minecraft so he didn't really appreciate the game. Now that he's grown up he's super into it and man... the things that kid makes are just insane. They're not your typical \"I made this dirt house!\" structures, they're full on castles and working underground bases, etc... \n\nI don't know if his love for the game and how creative he can be will grow to do anything for him in life, but it's still impressive what he can dream up and then create at such a young age. Minecraft definitely promotes creative thoughts and forces you to think logically/geometrically if you get your kid to play it right. I'd rather he play that then what I played as a kid (CoD, BF, etc...).",

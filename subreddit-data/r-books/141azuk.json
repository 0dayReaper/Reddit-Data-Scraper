    "postText": "Burner account obviously - and also Ive never committed the crimes Alex has - r!pe and murder ect . Yet when I was younger I was very horrible and violent , being involved in \"organised\" youth crime and such.\n\nI'm really not proud of it and the shame of it I live with every single day of my life. Yet I oddly relate to the latter half of the book. For example when Alex suicidally goes into the library , only to end up beaten and attacked by the past victims that he coincidentally meets in the library. He remarks about how \" that was two years ago\" and he's changed . He even has the empathic realisation that it feels a lifetime ago for him but \"perhaps not for them\". \n\nWhen revisiting family or friends from my youth I hear about the things I did (and whilst longer than 2 years) I really relate to this piece of the book. Feeling that so much has changed for you , your environment, your emotions , the way you perceive others but people still see you as a criminal or a bastard. Furthermore Alex exclaims how he's suffered and suffered and paid equal . I think for people who have been addicts/made bad choices against others (this being me) this is actually relatable. People don't realise that you suffered because the fact that you made them suffered over rules that (rightfully I don't think myself or Alex deserves sympathy) but still this can lead to social isolation or feelings of loneliness due to the sensation that people don't see your inherent human struggle as equal as others.\n\nI guess I just really relate to the later half and wondered if anyone cares to weigh an Insight or agree. I think ideas of reforming criminals is littered throughout the book and as a reformed criminal this almost taboo subject I think is dealt with greatly and yes perhaps my insight is worth something but this is just a ramble on Reddit so who fucking knows.",

I was basically adopted by my uncle because I was kind of a problem. I spent years going in and out of juvies/jails and the best cellie I ever had in jail was this kid who was there on murder charges, gang shit. There was really nothing psychologically wrong with him, he was a product of his environment and the opportunities in it, being in jail was of no surprise to him, that was just a common pathway for young guys from his neighborhood. He was a nice guy, kind, decent.\n\nMy uncle also happened to adopt a kid from the foster system and the kid grew up pretty close to my cellie. Lil bro also encountered gang recruitment stuff when he was young. Lil bro had my uncle intervene. Lil bro now attends one of the best colleges in the nation.",

The fact that there are 21 chapters symbolizes this natural growth to maturity, as 21 was considered the age one became an adult when he wrote the novel. It's certainly difficult to deal with the cognitive dissonance of having done terrible things in the past, but still believing one is fundamentally a good person, but I *do* think Burgess intends for us, by the end of the novel, to have a certain level of empathy for Alex.\n\nWe are not our pasts.",

What about the idea of unintentionally doing bad things in your past without realizing the true impact or consequence? Obviously wisdom and age (should) bring clarity. We are fundamentally every choice we've ever made, and in some cases, choices made for us. Our past shouldn't need to define us if we've grown into better choices since and atoned in some way.

There is no such thing as \"fundamental good\" and one should not consider good and evil to be a quality that people possess or not. Good and evil are qualities that actions have. Any person, no matter how good their actions until today, is only one sufficiently evil act from being a monster. Similarly, a person with the most awful record can begin to right the balance, today, with a good action.\n\nThat's what people mean when they say evil can be redeemed, they mean that the only thing one has to do to start doing good, is start.

My main focus was in response to the book and the OPs premise of aging out of that type of behavior and an   assumed rehabilitation.  And, that reparations can lead to rehabilitation through empathy with the victim.  In the case of the book, the empathy was forced through psychological trauma, so he wasn't truly rehabilitated at that point.\n\nArgumentatively, it is proven that our form of punishment reinforces and promotes criminal behavior.  Also, the culture of toxic alpha masculinity usually associated with gangs and the crime culture prohibits the maturation referenced in the book.\n\nA great example of this is in the movie, it has been ages since I read the book, when Alex runs into his old gang mates, although they are coppers, they are still stuck in the immature violent stage, expressed through violence against Alex.",

Most, maybe even nearly all of them are at a point where they will continue on a terrible path. But to say it's always unforgivable is just wrong.\n\nA friend I play games with killed two people when he was 18. He didn't think of them as people at the time. To him, the only people were his family, and his gang. Everyone else was alive, but no more valuable than the cow that provided his breakfast or the fly he swatted on it. These people were enemies to him, not people. One of them was someone who likely killed his people, one of them an innocent stranger in the wrong place.\n\nHe spent a long time in jail, and tells me that for most of it he felt regret only for getting caught. But as he met more and more people in jail who were not his blood who he learned were complex people just like him and his, he started to realize the real consequences wasn't jail, it was the person who did him no wrong not being able to exist. It took even more time to realize the person who DID wrong him deserved to live. \n\nPeople aren't born murderers or rapists. They don't permanently transform from \"person\" to \"rapist\", changing all of their essential being. They're born as people, and they live complicated lives, lives which may have made you a murderer or rapist if you lived them. \n\nWhen you discard them all as unforgivable filth who do not matter, you're taking into your heart the very same thought they took in when they committed their crime.",

Murder can be a crime of circumstance or necessity \u2014 like if someone is economically disadvantaged and this leads to them needing to be involved with gang violence, or people might murder to escape abusers, etc. I can\u2019t 100% say that if I\u2019d grown up in that sort of environment that I wouldn\u2019t be driven to such violence too. \n\nBut rape is not like that. There is no situation in which someone\u2019s economic hardship or personal safety necessitates rape. It\u2019s just not how that works. I can say with 100% certainty that there is no situation in which I would EVER do that. No matter my upbringing or any possible detail of my life.\n\nYou\u2019re right, rapists were not born evil. I don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting that. They were born with free will, like you or I, and they chose to use that free will to commit one of the worst crimes imaginable. Not because they were pushed there by circumstance. But because they could, and they wanted to. \n\nSo maybe they can be rehabilitated. Maybe they won\u2019t reoffend. I dislike the prison system, so I don\u2019t particularly advocate for life sentences. But they are not entitled to my or anyone else\u2019s forgiveness.",

Bringing up rape would weaken my broader argument as a result, and I think actually discussing it would be difficult because it, mostly rightfully, triggers the reactionary \"ew you weirdo\" part of the brain that nobody would be able to engage with.\n\nBut while I'm here, I do want to challenge you a little on this, even if it doesn't result in much of anything. There are a lot of ways a person can rape another. It calls to mind violent, screaming, brutal assaults in an alley. Those are worse than most murders that are actually done.\n\nBut let's look at other things which are absolutely also rape. Do you think a life sentence for a particularly immature 25 year old with a 16 year old girlfriend who he doesn't realize he is harming is appropriate? Do you think he couldn't be better, or couldn't have been taught to be? Rape cases are difficult to prosecute by nature, how confident can you ever really be about most convicted rapists? \n\nAnd finally, no, I'd never violently rape a person and trust that you wouldn't either. But when I was young, I did do things that today I consider sexual assault, predatory, and without continuous enthusiastic consent. Things which a lot of people consider very ordinary if not scummy - like lying, pestering, manipulating, even downright begging.  Do you think the label unforgivable is appropriate for situations like that? I didn't think I was doing anything wrong, in part because I considered rape an unforgivable distant thing that I clearly wasn't doing.",

Neither was necessarily violent, but that doesn\u2019t make them any less traumatizing for me or despicable on their part.\n\nThe first person knew exactly what they were doing, exactly what lies to tell to get me alone, and they did it to a string of other young girls. Just because there wasn\u2019t a knife to my throat doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t a self aware, extremely harmful act.\n\nThe second person was a romantic partner who I don\u2019t believe did anything out of malice. I think they genuinely didn\u2019t think that me saying no and trying to leave meant they should stop. I struggle with this one a lot because I did make excuses for them for many years, and I do hope that they\u2019ve grown as a person and don\u2019t do the same thing to their next partner. But at the same time, this repeated abuse has severely damaged my life, my perception of self, my ability to ever feel safe with a romantic partner. While I don\u2019t think they intended to hurt me, and I hope they can change, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something I can ever forgive them for. And if someone I confided in forgave them, that would feel pretty awful as well. \n\nTo be clear, neither of these people faced any legal repercussions. Most rapists, particularly nonviolent ones, don\u2019t. You\u2019re talking as if a random coercive person automatically gets a life sentence, which is just not how it works. And as I said in my original post, I don\u2019t advocate for life sentences. I don\u2019t even necessarily know what sort of legal consequences I would want for the people who have hurt me. And I hope they can reform. But forgiveness? I have to live with the consequences of their actions for the rest of my life. I don\u2019t think they should just be able to waltz into the sunset with no care at all for the damage they\u2019ve done. Again, this doesn\u2019t mean infinite jail time. But I can hope for someone\u2019s reform without forgiving their past actions.",

But when you then take the other countries here which focus on punishment (*cough*US*cough*) into account it tends to get _very_ heated.\n\nThere's currently a case heading towards the constitutional court in Germany if a person found not guilty of a murder can be prosecuted a second time when new evidence surfaces which was not available the first time (in this case, DNA evidence which they didn't have the means to analyze back then).\n\nOne camp argues that murder is so anti social that you should prosecute it (plus obviously the usual \"family of the victims needs the satisfaction\" argument).\n\nMiddle camp is worried that if we change that for something like murder we might in the long term change that for other crimes as well.\n\nAnd camp to the completely other side argues we should use this opportunity to get rid of the statute of limitations exception for murder - something we only have as they've been dragging their feet on following up on Nazi crimes, and that was required for being able to continue prosecution.\n\nMy initial reaction was \"why would we get rid of that excemption?\", but the arguments of that side are pretty convincing - outside of revenge there's not really a reason for prosecuting something like that decades later. And in a justice system focused on rehabilitation that has no place - somebody who murdered someone two decades ago, and after that has comitted no crime is successfully rehabilitated. Going after them at that point would achieve the opposite of what the justice system is aiming to do.",

It's certainly the question the novel poses, whether or not it's better to let people have free will if it means they're capable of the horrendous things Alex does, but also robs any ability to feel good things. The book is written with enough complexity to know that both sides have compelling arguments and provides both of those arguments through Alex. I think the novel with the original publication,  does say that giving someone a chance at rehabilitation can allow them to walk toward a better future, though I think every person is gonna have a different amount of acceptance with that.",

Forgiveness from others may or may not come, and while it's great if you get it, ultimately it's all just outside voices. In the end, it's only you who's gotta live with what you've done. Sometimes that means dealing with consequences from others, but you don't need to put yourself on the list of people angry at you. Make amends where you can, apologize where you can't, understand some people will need longer than others, if they ever come around to you again. But in all cases, commit to being better.

Most of them grow to work on themselves and reform, not due to the use of force upon them by the State, but simply because they mature and \"awaken\". Alex is shown to be fully capable of commiting violence after his imprisonment, but in the last chapter has, of his own free will, become a legitimate citizen of his society that recognizes his past actions were harmful. I think the text implies that such people are worthy of our forgiveness.",

Sometimes it takes a catalyst, an event, something out of our control to give us the push to change our situation. Other times it takes self realization and a desire to do differently.\n\nMultiple times in my life I've gone through fundamental changes that required a change of scenery, a move, dropping of certain people/places/things that were enabling bad behavior along with a concerted effort to make different choices and avoid those behaviors in the future. \n\nI've reinvented myself multiple times, and these days those dark days are little more than stories of a past life.

Good on you.\n\nThat said, I have zero sympathy for you feeling lonely or isolated for your actions.\n\nEight years ago, I was woken up to the news that my niece had brutally murdered my developmentally disabled nephew in his sleep. She was a teenager, and he was in his 20s (physically; mentally he was more like a 2-3 year old).\n\nHere's how it affected me at the time:\n\nI was writing my master's thesis, and it caused an instant writer's block that lasted over a year. For the first couple of weeks I could barely fall asleep at night without being blind drunk.\n\nI went to therapy for over a year to deal with the situation, and the resulting anger issues which kept me from being able to sleep at night after the first few weeks. I'd lie awake in bed, seething and digging my nails so hard into my palms that I'd wake up with indentations on my hands after I finally fell asleep.\n\nI almost lost several friends over the murder, because they didn't know how to relate to me about it. Even though I would have been happy to just hang out, game or whatever, to try to forget for a moment what my life was.\n\nI ended up having to cut contact with my family for a while, because they were rallying behind my murderous niece - felt real great to have them trying to gaslight me about *me* being the weird one for \"still\" being angry about a **literal fucking murder** less than a year after it happened.\n\nMy half-sister (her mother) kept trying to make me include her murderous daughter in the family to the point that I even went to family therapy in hopes of it helping her realize why I felt the way that I felt. No luck.\n\nShe tried convincing me to do **exposure therapy** to **get over** her wanting to force me to hang out with someone who murdered a family member of mine **while he slept**.\n\nMy half-sister kept trying to badger me and my wife into accepting her murderous daughter back into the family, to the point that it almost ruined our wedding - she made it about herself, and how **heartless** we were for not wanting to have a murderer at our wedding.\n\nWe ended up finally cutting contact to my half-sister completely when she stormed into our house, trying to manipulate me into feeling bad about not wanting a **fucking murderer**  be an active part of my family, and then yelling in front of our toddler when the manipulation didn't work.\n\nSo yeah. \n\nForgiving that murderer, or her mother who doesn't see why we might be uncomfortable having our son or ourselves around a murderer? Never going to happen. Going to shun them both for the rest of their lives, because ***nothing is more important than the safety of me or my family***.",

                    "comment": "Long answer ahead !!!\n\nTo be honest , for myself, nothing? Fun? Joy? Excitement? Id say all these are quite fitting. \n\nFor more \"social\" and \"exhilarating\" crime or shitty act , The people I was friends with and would do these things with all got a similar kick from it . A sense of joy or shared humour . As much as we could sit and giggle at a month python sketch we could do the same watching someones head getting kicked in outside a night club. \n\nEven looking back , the act (crime violence) makes me feel quite faint or just generally opposed to\n Yet thinking about the FEELING (just the feeling not the act) that came from it is unparalleled. it's a similar hit that can be compared to drug use. for example nitrous oxide , the act of depriving your brain of oxygen sounds horrible , but the immediate euphoria that follows is incomparable. As someone who dealt with addiction alongside these , it was all the same. I could get off doing a line but sometimes a bit of \"ultra violence\" as Alex said really was the easier and stronger high . We were adrenaline junkies just of a different breed . Where one may see a great height and wish to jump , we would see a great height and laugh at the prospect of pushing another off. In no way am I bragging, it's sick and certainly a trait of myself I now destain .\n\nI never really realised where this begun and even in reflection I don't.  From a sociological stand point I think Howard Becker gets it right.  \n\nBecker proposes that the labelling society places upon an individual directly invokes or promotes their acts . For example the more you hear people around you say \" you're a criminal\" the more you'll want to be involved in criminal subculture and partake in criminal act . Or more colloquially, more you hear \" you're a geek\" the more likely you may be to seek out \" geek \" communities.\n\nAs for the less violent or \"exciting\" such as manipulation, deceit, lying. That was mix of nothing and coming from a place of self defence. Just due to shit when I was younger . To be honest as well from a reformed point of view , the violence, attacks and stuff is even culturally the more attractive. The lying and stuff that goes with it is more morbid and less attractive and I think that's because of the deeper seeded issues it implies .I think Becker is still strong here . The more I was told I'm a lying thieving junkie the more I wanted to well , lie , thieve and get high (which is a reason not an excuse) \n\nYou can summarise this all and just say a lack of care. It was fun because we didn't care about the other people , I was indifferent because I didn't care . Funnily enough for me \"anger\" was never apart of it at all , because there's a fundamental difference between types of criminals , so I can only speak on my experience.\n\nSo there ya go , apologies for such a long response maybe that will provide some insight.",

If you've been through any of that yourself, you get better at recognizing when others have really changed. It's not even necessary to have gone off the deep end and really hurt a lot of people either. Just letting regret overcome ego and you have the tools to gain control. That's what I got out of this book. Similar themes in Heart Of Darkness too.\n\nNot only that, but when you can empathize with the unreformed, despicable scoundrels, then you have a powerful tool to bring yourself back from the brink. This is something that people sometimes don't realize as the benefit of reading a book with a horrible protagonist. It's a truly cathartic experience for the writer too.",

I didn't set the world on fire or anything to that degree, but I certainly put myself before others without a thought about how it would affect them.  It affected them negatively across the board, but I didn't care, until I decided I didn't like who I was.  Now I reflect on that \"me\" from time to time.\n\nIt has been years, and I still feel the ghosts of my past occasionally, even from those who have \"forgiven\" me.  But I realize that this is something I will just have to bear because it was *me* that created this situation, not them.\n\nI guess in a way I can relate to the first half of the book as well.  Shameless lying, utterly selfish actions, disbelief that others didn't \"respect\" me.\n\nThe second part has resonance in my life in that I have, according to law, paid my debts to society (minor as they were in my case).  Trying to come to terms with the consequences beyond the legal for my actions.  Things never will be the same as before.\n\nI don't think the punishment was what made me change so much as the realization that they will keep kicking me and kicking me until I do change or resign myself to this treatment for the rest of my life (rightfully, and for my own actions).  I decided that I didn't want that.  I am not exactly a great or wonderful person now.  But I do make an effort to be decent, and sometimes even good.  \n\nThanks for the post.",

Most of them grow to work on themselves and reform, not due to the use of force upon them by the State, but simply because they mature and \"awaken\". Alex is shown to be fully capable of commiting violence after his imprisonment, but in the last chapter has, of his own free will, become a legitimate citizen of his society that recognizes his past actions were harmful. I think the text implies that such people are worthy of our forgiveness.\n\nEdit: I found the pared-down introduction of a recently published edition of the book here, you can Ctrl+F it for the words \"redemption\" or \"forgive\" and see what I mean. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/irvine-welsh-anthony-burgesss-savagely-brilliant-clockwork-orange/ I hope it goes without saying that an introduction in a published copy of a novel is typically not a fringe interpretation of a work.\"",

    "postText": "Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!  A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many \"suggest some books\" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!\n\n**The Rules**\n\n* Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.\n\n* All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.\n\n* All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.\n\n____\n\n**How to get the best recommendations**\n\nThe most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.\n\n____\n\nAll Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, we've set the suggested sort to new; you may need to set this manually if your app or settings ignores suggested sort.\n\nIf this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.\n               \n- The Management",

            "comment": "Hi, I am someone who is very interested in topics such as deliberate practice, intent, and self improvement. However, the meat grinder of books written by people who are widely known appeal little to me since the things that they bring up are rather elementary, so I thought I'd just ramble on a little in hopes of maybe someone recognizing something I said from some book. \n\nMost of the concepts I've picked up over the years in these fields have been through picking some topic I have no knowledge of and then being forced to learn about them as I go along learning a new skill. However at some point I realized that as you reach an upper percentage of understanding, the concepts, and constructions of methods etc all play out the same but rather that the niche intricacies change from field to field, to the point where I've found it easy to have conversations about these things with people from completely different fields.\n\nI understand that what I bring up might not be super helpful, so I'd like to give some of my own suggestions:\n\nOne thought is perhaps gaining a better understanding of the general human psychology might help all those other subfields. It is easier to understand what true intent means perhaps, when one understands what it takes to reach the mental state required for true intent. So perhaps something in psychology?\n\nAnother thought was perhaps a more scientifically oriented book, which tries to show how different habits or behavioral patterns lead to our decision making.Obviously this might as well be tied into the psychology category.\n\nLastly would be ideas of game theory or decision making theory, but my primary problem with this one would be that I fear it becomes too \"grad-level\" mathematically, and something I've noticed with such books is that they take beautiful at most times shady leaps of faith for their mathematical reasoning, and this becomes specially dangerous to apply alot of your knowledge upon when its not massive batches of data you're fitting to some model that can tell you that your assumptions hold quite well with reality, and instead is just me using trial and error to see whether an idea would improve my own anectodal experience in some topic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay so after reading this schizo post if any of it at all itched something in the back of any of your heads I'd love to hear your recommendations. Sorry for being so sporadic! Thank you for any help :p.",

If a quick read is what you want, you can just read a summary on the internet. But, bear in mind that if you're looking for self improvement, you're looking for new ways of thinking, essentially. And that is something that takes time, and requires ideas that are not quick or easy to digest at first.\n\nRegarding self-help books, it is true that you can get the main ideas from a summary, but they probably won't stick to you for long. And thus, no real change will happen. There's a reason why authors give so many examples and repeat things in different ways on those kinds of books, and it's basically for you to be able to relate to them in your day to day life.\n\nAfter a summary or a video, it is most likely that you're going to forget about it after a couple of days. But, after so many pages, there\u2019s definitely at least one main idea that will stuck with you for long, eventually producing the desired improvement if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after.",

But, I think, I have rather non-standard requests: I need it to not contain, let's say, \"evil\", there was no vulgarity, obscene language, and, in general, something that leaves some kind of sadness and emptiness after reading (in other words, i need a pure one). In general, I am a believer, so I ask for help in good advice. As for the genre, everyday life, slice of life, maybe it may contain some romance (but not necessarily), and sports are possible.

A lot of my reading felt fairly aimless, sporadic, and on occaisions too diverse / unfocused. I could never sit and feel involved in the reading process \u2013 I blame some of this on university. \n\nNonetheless, I'm taking a new approach and I'd love some help in establishing my reading list. I'm currently following the C.S. Lewis model of reading two old books for every new one I read. I'm taking this to mean two 'classics' for every contemporary / new release. I've also added one non-fiction book into the mix, so I'm taking things in groups of four. \n\nMy current theme is unrest / revolution in France, and these are the books I'm reading / am yet to read (and in the order I'm going to read them):\n\n* A Tale of Two Cities (Charles Dickens) \\[classic\\]\n* Napoleon at Peace (William Doyle) \\[non-fiction\\]\n* Les Miserables (Victor Hugo) \\[classic\\]\n* Scarlet (Genevieve Cogman) \\[contemporary\\]\n\nI've got a couple more themes lined up thus far: suicide, and vampires. Suicide I have fairly lined up, but I'm struggling to find non-fiction and contemporary books for vampires. I'm hoping to find two books that feel fairly contiguous to the two 'classics' I've chosen, Dracula (Bram Stoker) and I am Legend (Richard Matheson). If anyone has any recommendations for this theme, I would be so grateful. Any recommendations for themes / lists would also be greatly appreciated!",

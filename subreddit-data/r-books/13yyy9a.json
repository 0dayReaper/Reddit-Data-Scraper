    "postText": "Hello all! So I keep a Google doc of every book I\u2019ve read since freshman year of high school. My question is: let\u2019s say you get a collection that contains one novel, two novellas, a few short stories. How should I track that? Do I just count the collection as one book? Do I break it down by novel, novellas, and short story? I usually just put down anthologies that only contain short stories as a single book on the doc. I have OCD so stuff like this really gets under my skin and is really distracting.",

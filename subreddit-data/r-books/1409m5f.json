    "postText": "I have a question about the Jade City Trilogie. If someone read all three Books maybe he could help me. (Spoilers are no Problem)\n\nI have read the first half of the first Book an i can imagine the Story of the Rest. I need someone who tells me if my Imagination is right. \n\nFirst Book: The two Clans get into Conflict, maybe War and one of the Siblings dies.\nSecond Book: The war rages but we can see a bigger Threat on the Horizon. \nThird Book: The Threat is now clear, the two Clans are making a Peacedeal to fight the Big Threat, Happy End.\n\nAm i right? I hope not cause this Story would be pretty Boring. \n\n(Sorry for my Bad English) \n\nThanks for the help!",

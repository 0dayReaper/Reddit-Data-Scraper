    "postText": "Hey guys! I am reading War and Peace for the first time, and I was reading the scene at the opera. It kept emphasizing Helene being nearly naked, her bosom being completely exposed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, i am a regency fan, big Jane Austen lover, and I love period dramas and when I picture the dress they are wearing, I am simply imagining it to be low cut. ( i linked to an image). Is helene at the Opera with her FULLL bosom exposed? Am I reading this wrong?",

            "comment": "In what otherwise seemed  a good translation (I forget the translator, it was a library book) there was a scene where General Kutuzov is obviously patting a child affectionately, but it was translated as he was \"fondling the child.\" I don't know the original Russian, but a different English word probably should've been chosen.",

It's the way we use that word that's changed, likely decades after that translation was made. \n\nFondling can be loving or erotic. There's plenty of instances in books where people fondle horses and dogs or other companion animals for example.",

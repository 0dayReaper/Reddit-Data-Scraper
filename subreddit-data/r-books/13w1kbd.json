I\u2019m honestly upset with myself for dragging myself through this whole book, I got it free from the library but still want my money back it was that frustrating. It\u2019s 200 pages of non stop talk about Apple and Harley Davidson with very few relevant points. I\u2019d love to hear other opinions, I\u2019d like to know if it\u2019s that bad, or if it just rubbed me the wrong way for some reason",

They're rarely experts on the subject matter.\n\n'A More Beautiful Question' is far superior to 'Start With Why'.",

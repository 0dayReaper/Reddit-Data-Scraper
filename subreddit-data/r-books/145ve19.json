    "postText": "An entertaining story that I breezed through in two days; my favorite author's prose sings as usual. I do, however, have three major gripes with the plot:\n\n1. Too much infidelity. I get it happens a lot in real life, but it's a bit tiresome when two of your main characters are cheaters and don't get punished for it.\n\n2. Speaking of which, I disliked Anton Waker's fate. (Spoilers from here) If someone ruins the lives of others and indirectly plays a hand in *over a dozen deaths*, I want the asshole to rot in prison, not moodily reflect on his guilt in the novel's final paragraph. Fuck that dude.\n\n3. I would've liked to learn more about the ultimate fates of Sophie and the titular singer. The novel feels about 20-30 pages shorter than it should be. \n\nPerhaps I love Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul and their universe of \"actions have consequences\" too much, but this novel is sorely lacking in karma.\n\n---\n\nWith that, I have read all of ESJM's novels and have enjoyed them all to a certain extent or another. My rankings/grades:\n\n6th: The Singer's Gun - See above. Good, but her most flawed work. **B-**\n\n5th: Last Night In Montreal - Interesting and with an excellent twist at the end. **B**\n\n4th: The Lola Quartet - Gavin Sasaki is my favorite of ESJM's protagonists, mainly because he's juuuuuuust flawed enough to be interesting without being outright dislikable. The plot here is one of her tightest and satisfying as well. **B+**\n\n3rd: Sea of Tranquility - Not super original as far as sci-fi novels go, but I enjoyed it nonetheless and found its examination of the future quite interesting. **B+**\n\n2nd: The Glass Hotel - A fun excursion into the 2000s and the Kingdom of Money. **A-**\n\n1st: Station Eleven - Her magnum opus, and a work she is unlikely to surpass in quality - but never say never! **A**",

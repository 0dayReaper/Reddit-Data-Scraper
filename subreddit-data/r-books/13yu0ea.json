    "postText": "i just finished The Color of Law by Richard Rothstein and although it took me a while to finish it  I thought the book was extremely well researched and expertly written, it was also rage-inducing. I would get too angry when reading about the blatant and systemic discrimination used by federal, state, and local governments to keep areas segregated and have to put the book down for a while. If you want to understand the causes of racial segregation in our cities and suburbs, this book is a good place to start.",

A very damning book that makes systematic racism much more understandable in everyday human terms.  Sadly there are several others subjects about which similar problems (and books) exist.  One hopes the more people read about it the more aware we become as a society and tackle the problem instead of sweeping it under the rug, pretending it doesn\u2019t and never did exist.",

            "comment": "I started the book forever ago and didn't finish it but it had nothing to do with the book. I was just in a reading slump and barely read anything for a few years. I have the book and think about picking it back up often. I could tell just from the first 50 or so pages that a lot of research was involved. My knowledge of segregation and red-lining is minimal and I need to read it from the beginning so i can have a deeper knowledge. \n\nI mostly came here to recommend The Color of Compromise by Jemar Tisby as well since you liked this. Tisby is a historian and The Color of Compromise is basically a survey of race relations in the U.S. and how Christian churches and the government perpetuated systemic racism and how churches influenced the things like The Virginia Assembly and racist aws during and after slavery. He also writes about how there are several different denominations like Methodist and Baptist denominations because churches and pastors disagreed on whether to be for or against slavery and for or against segregation. The book was well-researched and engaging. The book avoided being didactic because the focus was on history and not on trying to influence religious beliefs of readers.",

If you wish to explore the subject of race relations and systemic inequality more deeply, I would recommend the following:\n\n*Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America* (Ibram X. Kendi)\n\n*White Trash: The 400-Year Untold Story of Class in America* (Nancy Isenberg)\n\n*White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of our Racial Divide* (Carol Anderson)\n\n*The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness* (Michelle Alexander)",

    "postText": "Growing up in the early 2000s, I was fortunate to have grown up in the era of Harry Potter and the phenomenon it was. I didn\u2019t quite catch on that hype train and got more into The Lightning Thief and the Percy Jackson series. Off the top of my head, there was also Artemis Fowl, The Hunger Games, and the Warriors series.  \n\n\nWhat made those stories stand out to me was the feeling that my classmates and I were growing along the characters. They were aging as we were and we could follow the progression of our lives with the progression of our favorite characters. \n\n\nI\u2019ve gone full weeb now, so I\u2019m exposed to lots of anime and manga. Even though I\u2019m past the age of the characters in these stories, I appreciate how new authors and ideas are always getting chances. \n\n\nI\u2019m obviously not exposed enough to contemporary American media and I\u2019m outside the age group that I\u2019m asking about. I understand good writing is timeless, and classic franchises like Marvel, DC, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings have plenty of capacity for brilliant stories. However, I\u2019m wondering if this generation\u2019s Harry Potter is just waiting in the wings or if there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s hit it big yet. I hope today\u2019s young readers can have the experience of a series that grows along with them.",

The Maureen Johnson Truly Devious series as well, along with Jennifer Lynn Barnes Inheritance Games.  And manga is always going out. Older series like Dragonball, One Piece, and even Sailor Moon. I can't keep manga on my shelves for a very long time. And, it might sound funny, but the Twilight Series is coming back. Maybe because the movies are on Netflix or something?",

Harry Potter was something of a perfect storm of events and circumstances that's going to be extremely hard for anyone to replicate.",

Its onto its fourth book now, and it seems to have the Harry Potter aspect of the growing sense of seriousness and darkness as the series progresses. Marvelous reads, all of them.\n\nAnother popular fictional world is the Grishaverse. I haven't read all the books, but the Crows duology was extremely gripping.",

I also still read in the age demographic so know that some popular authors are Coleen Hoover, Leigh Bardugo and Sally Rooney. \n\nAlso surprisingly enough there's a lot of 'old literature' from when I was a teen/young reader still making the rounds on social media sites such as #booktok and #booktube. Some of these include 'The Hunger Games' and 'Harry Potter' etc.",

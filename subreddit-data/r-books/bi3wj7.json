    "postText": "Let me start by saying this is the list of books that \\*\\*I enjoyed\\*\\*.  I'm not saying that #1 is better than #10, I'm simply saying I enjoyed it more.   Not all of these books have crazy symbolism and story arcs and deep character/world building, some of them were just fun reads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have read nearly every classic science fiction book available, and a lot of contemporary and non-classics as well.  Also, a disclaimer: there is no cyberpunk in here, no Stephenson or Gibson.  I have tried to read several cyberpunk authors and simply didn't find them enjoyable, despite the talent that is clearly present in their writings and world building skills.  Oh, and I haven't read the Foundation series, so that's why it's not on here (yet).   \n\n\nApologies for not doing a top 25 (or even a top 100 that was requested), I just don't have the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, without further ado, here are my top 15:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **The Sparrow (Mary Doria Russell)** **-** I addressed this in my previous post, I thought this book was fantastic. The first half is slow, yes, but the second half more than made up for it in my opinion.  A Jesuit priest and his friends discover singing coming from a planet 4-5 light years away.  The Jesuits are the first to be able to mount an expedition to this new planet, and the priest and his friends are the crew selected to lead it.  The story starts with the priest, back on Earth after the trip, and all of humanity wants him dead or imprisoned.  This book gave me a more intense emotional reaction than any book I've ever read.  I literally shouted out loud \"NO NO no no no no no no...\" at one point and had to put it down for the day.\n2. **Hyperion Series (Dan Simmons)** \\- The Sparrow knocked this out of first place, yes, but I haven't read the sequel to it, so as far as series of books go, this one is at the top bar none.  I preferred the first two books, but the second two were very fun reads as well.  7 people are selected all around the universe to venture into the Time Tombs in a mysterious planet with a violent and murderous monster on it known as the Shrike.  That's all I can say, this story is so sprawling that anything more than that just doesn't do it justice. Just an all around unbelievable experience.\n3. **The Stand (Steven King)** \\- A virus wipes out 99% of the population, and the survivors have dreams that direct them to either Boulder, CO, where civilization is starting to rebuild (symbolically Heaven), or Las Vegas, which is more a Mad-Max-everyones-killing-each-other-no-laws-type society (symbolically Hell). Whether you consider it science fiction or not, this deserves to make the list.  Loved this one.  I've heard it compared to Swan Song, so I was excited to pick that up, but was ultimately disappointed.  There's no argument to be made for SS being better than The Stand.\n4. **I, Robot (Isaac Asimov) -** I picked this book up semi-dreading the read, and just trying to work my way through the classics.  I figured it was one of those classics that everyone wants to have read but no one wants to read.  I was dead wrong.  I knew it was going to make a statement about A.I., but I didn't know how entertaining it was going to be.  Every story, every section, every word was also run to read, and the writing style kept my attention from start to finish.\n5. **Dune (Frank Herbert) -** No surprise here, it's an absolute classic. Not much to say about this book that hasn't already been said.  If you haven't read it, do so immediately.\n6. **The Forge of God** **(Greg Bear)** \\- An alien lands in the United States, and the only message he can give us before he dies is \"I'm sorry, I'm too late\" or something to that effect.  I love alien contact novels, and this was probably my favorite.  Sprawling, a lot of characters, a lot of viewpoints and different situation.  Huge action, a real page-turner.  This isn't the most philosophical or complex book, but it is a massively fun read. And the end, damn the end was crazy. I could definitely see it being made into a movie, but it doesn't have the feel of a novel written *specifically* to be made into a movie.\n7. **The Forever War (Joe Haldeman) -** I believe this was the first military sci-fi book I read.  I didn't know much about military sci-fi and was doubtful that I would like it, especially since it sounded like a parallel of the Vietnam War.  Again, dead wrong. This book has a lot to say, and it says it extremely eloquently.  Humanity is in an interstellar war against the Taurens, and the soldiers who visit home (because of time dilation) visit after huge periods of time, so it's a good take on where humanity will be in 500, 1000, and 10000 years from now. Again, this one was hard to put down.  \n8. **Not Alone (Craig Falconer)** \\- A lot of you probably haven't heard of this book, I think it's pretty obscure.  Why is it so high up on this list?  Well some of my favorite novels are alien first-contact novels, and my favorite *parts* of those novels are the moments between a group of people finding out about the existence of ETs and whole world finding out about them.  This book is that idea under a magnifying glass. A UFO enthusiast stumbles upon incontrovertible evidence that not only do aliens exist, but that humanity has had contact with them for years.  And what does he do?  He leaks it anonymously on Twitter, which of course leads to a melt down as the world sees the evidence.  Great book, in fact I enjoyed it so much I messaged Craig Falconer on Facebook after I finished it just to tell him what a fun read I thought it was.\n9. **The Sirens of Titan (Kurt Vonnegut) -** An interstellar story as only Vonnegut could tell it. My favorite Vonnegut book besides maybe his Welcome to the Monkey House collection of short stories.  If you've never read any Vonnegut, I'd still say it's a great place to start.\n10. **Nightfall (Isaac Asimov + Robert Silverberg)** \\- Takes place on a planet in a multiple star solar system that never experiences night.  Within even 15 minutes of pure darkness, residents of the planet lose their minds or even die. Scientists on the planet discover that once every 2000 years, there is a total solar eclipse that leave the planet in complete darkness, which matches up with the fact that once every 2000 years their entire civilization completely caves in.  Of course they make this discovery very close to the 2000 year mark.\n11. **Old Man's War (John Scalzi) -** Military sci-fi, the elderly can basically get a complete regeneration of their body, restoring them to their 20s, if they agree to fight in an interstellar war.  I'm not making it sound very interesting, but it was a great read.\n12. **Childhood's End (Arthur C. Clarke) -** Mmmm love me some Arthur C. Clarke. A peaceful alien invasion happens, with the result being that the aliens will share a technology, etc, if humanity agrees to end all wars, ban slavery, things of that nature.  Humans do, and the results humanity sees within themselves, and the changes the Overlords bring make quite the interesting novel.\n13. **Spin (Robert Charles Wilson) -** One night, all the stars go out.  It's discovered that someone or something has put a permeable membrane all around Earth, and no one knows why.  Of course our protagonist dedicates his life to figuring out what's going on.  I particularly liked the ending to this book.  Great read, fun.\n14. **Starship Troopers (Robert Heinlein)-** Another military sci fi in the vein of Old Man's War and The Forever War.  I think I read all 3 of these back to back.  They're sort of the heavy hitters of the military sci-fi genre, and I loved everyone one of them.  Other military sci-fi I've tried to read, and they just don't do it for me. \n15. **Footfall (Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle)** \\- Almost forgot this one, but it's about an alien invasion where the aliens aren't *that* far ahead of humans, technologically.  And they show up to our planet expecting us to still be in the stone age, so they're surprised when they see how little time it's taken us to come so far.  Extremely entertaining, and gives viewpoints from both human and alien characters.  The only thing I didn't like was how the aliens supposedly looked.  Like baby elephants, pretty much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Honorable Mentions:** Ringworld, Out of the Dark, I am Legend, The Three-Body Problem, War of the Worlds, Rendezvous with Rama, Calculating God, Roadside Picnic, The Puppet Masters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, I'm sure I've forgotten some good ones, be it intentionally or not, I'm writing this over my lunch break.  \n\n\nAnyway, that's my list.  Hope you enjoyed, and hopefully it gave you some recommendations for future reading.  Feel free to message me for specific recommendations or anything else.\n\n\nEdit: Yep forgot the Enders Game series, probably should be on there. I read it like 30 times when I was a kid and sometimes forget it\u2019s even science fiction.\n\nEdit2: Since I guess I'm on the front page now, here's a quick edit.  I know I should read the Foundation Series, The Culture series, and Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep.  I read before bed a lot and these huge, sprawling space operas can sometimes be a lot after a long day.  And I stand by decision to put Starship Troopers over Stranger in a Strange Land, but I'll allow that both Stranger and Moon is a Harsh Mistress should probably have been an honorable mention.  Also for any of you that read or have read #8, Not Alone, I'd love to know what you think about it.\n\nEdit3: All right, all right, I'll join GoodReads.

Campbell Award winner, considered by many as spiritual successor to Robert Heinlein, but very much of a different cloth - and a lot of his writing is such that the Science Fiction is, at first glance, hard to see: in fact, in the first story he ever sold professionally (\"The Time-Traveler\"), the protagonist used no technological gizmo of any kind, but was a time-traveler, nonetheless, in the MOST philosophical of senses) \n\nNeal Stephenson (Multiple award winner, very long-winded in the vein of Stephen King, but worth the read, especially ~~*Anthem*~~ *Anathem*) \n\nL.E. Modesitt, Jr. (known for multiple series in multiple genres) \n\nHope this is a start down a new road of great reading.  \nAny other suggestions are welcome. :)\n\nEDIT: First Suggestion is... that I learn to spell more gooder.",

Stranger in A Strange Land is quite ahead of its time, I think, for depicting microgravity's effect on physiology and other such details. Reading it with the knowledge it was released during the Mercury Missions it is still very prescient.\n\n\nThe 60s saw a change to \"low sci-fi\": science fiction rooted not in accurate physics or detailed and intricate descriptions of technology, but instead detailed worlds and systems. \"Dune\" did for sci-fi what Lord of the Rings did for fantasy: fleshed out worlds, legends, histories, appendices in a genre that was often seen as fringe or lacking depth. This change likely made the genre more accessible and allowed for greater depth in narrative and theme without what some saw as a constriction and limit on the artistic liberties.",

My \"list\" would be similar to OP's, with The Sparrow, Forever War, and Old Man's War near the top. I would also add Station Eleven.\n\nI found that YES, ABSOLUTELY, the year of publication had a huge impact on my enjoyment of the book, and for several reasons:\n\n* Earlier science fiction in the series tended to have more straightforward plots and characters. They often didn't flow as smoothly or have as much character development as in more modern novels.\n\n* The way women and marginallized characters are treated covers a very wide range. Generally, I found women characters more robust in later books, though this is not a hard-and-fast rule.\n\n* Books from different eras were written in different cultural moments, which are more or less relevant to today's zeitgeist. \n\nThe first and second points are just facts about an evolving genre. The third was way more interesting. You get brainy 50s books that are half-story half-philosophucal experiment (Clarke, Asimov) then switch to early 60's books freaked out about nuclear annihilation (Canticle for Leibowitz), make a hard turn to Vietnam commentary (Forever War), then go totally off the rails at the idea of computers (Neuromancer, Snow Crash). They're heavily influenced by when they were written and selected for the award, and it is super interesting.",

Banks.\n\nEDIT2: An hour later and no one mentioned anything from Egan, so I would like to recommend him (especially to Lem fans). Yes, he may be a bit more niche as he can be a bit mathy and sometimes he refers to some heavy physics, but I think *Permutation City* is both great and approachable.\n\nEDIT3: To OP: I know my question can be read as a polite version of \"Why aren't these on your list?!\", but I am also actually curious whether you read them and what you thought about them, and if you have not, then I recommend them for next year(s) :D",

Just the passage that is repeated in various forms throughout the book, and finalized as the protagonist's view of his ideology later, is spectacular, and remains some of my favorite writing ever:\n\n&gt;\n\u201cIt is our suffering that brings us together. It is not love. Love does not obey the mind, and turns to hate when forced. The bond that binds us is beyond choice. We are brothers. We are brothers in what we share. In pain, which each of us must suffer alone, in hunger, in poverty, in hope, we know our brotherhood. We know it, because we have had to learn it. We know that there is no help for us but from one another, that no hand will save us if we do not reach out our hand. And the hand that you reach out is empty, as mine is. You have nothing. You possess nothing. You own nothing. You are free. All you have is what you are, and what you give.\u201d",

I was completely unsure what made Asimov think that having the Gaia stuff overshadow the Foundation stuff was a good idea and the story suffered so much for it. It honestly felt like he wrote it just for the Robots tie in as well as the tie in for that other one (the Eternals? or something like that), but he seems like too good of an artist to do it just for that.",

I\u2019d give Sirens of Titan an 8.5/10, Slaughterhouse Five (which I personally consider sci-fi) 9/10. This trilogy, I\u2019d give between 9.5-10/10. They are a phenomenal trilogy that all deeply explore the minds and lives of their characters and make you feel genuinely attached to them. She also has a way of building up tension to the point where you literally can\u2019t put it down. I highly recommend you give them a read, and then you\u2019ll have to update your list :P",

He read when he walks, when he poops, at stoplights, at the gas pump - he\u2019d read in the shower if he could, but instead he listens to audiobooks. When we met, he owned thousands of books. He\u2019d go to a bookstore twice a month and buy as many as he could carry. He wore a denim jacket so he could stuff the pockets with books. He\u2019s had an ebook for years now, so at the very least, we don\u2019t have books crowding every shelf anymore. \n\nI\u2019m gonna save this and I\u2019m excited to see if he\u2019s heard of these books. My prediction is that he\u2019s read at least 12 of them, if not all! I\u2019ll be sure to post an update.\n\nEdit: So, I showed him the list and he\u2019s read all but two! He\u2019s now telling me how good Nightfall was and that I should read it! He said he\u2019d read all but one of the honorable mentions as well! He immediately wrote down the ones he hasn\u2019t read, so I\u2019m happy I did this! Thank you! I asked if he had any recommendations and he said he really enjoyed Souls in the Great Machine.",

            "comment": "I'm surprised by how many of this books I've read, because I usually have very little in common with other sci-fi readers, besides the classics. And I'm even more surprised to see The Sparrow at number one, an extremely good, extremely gut wrenching, very under appreciated book. Mary Doria Russel has a very unique take on the genre.  \nI don't like recommending, but since you're into first contact stories, in case you haven't read it you could check Lilith's Brood, I loved those ones so much. Also others have mentioned Blindsight, by Peter Watts, but I'll mention it again because it's honestly my absolute favorite in first contact narratives, full of uncomfortable ideas, it's sequel/sidequel Echopraxia is also very good, but the difficult parts of Blindsight are even more so in Echopraxia, Watts really wants to believe his readers are quasi geniuses, and I definitely wasn't. Now, here's the thing about Blindsight, I finished the book hating it, it was one of those things that felt almost offensive to some of my dearly held beliefs, I thought about it for a long time, read it again and fell in love, I can't think of any other book which actually flipped my viewpoint.  \nOh, and \"Story of your Life\", on which Arrival is based, is much better than the movie... well, maybe they're just different animals for different niches. Story of you Life appears in the compilation Stories of your Life and Others, and all the others are also very good. Ted Chiang has a knack for taking some odd or even supernatural concept, and refining it into scientific law and then building great stories from that. Tower of Babylon, from that compilation, is not technically science fiction, I'd say it's Myth Science, and I cannot die before I see it turned into a movie. Seventy Two Letters would make an amazing Alienist-like miniseries.",

The aliens are so alien that it's difficult to decide whether they are intelligent or not, trying to invade or not, view humans as a threat or not.\n* China Mieville, *Embassytown*.  The novel is set many years after the point of first contact, which makes the fact that humans are still struggling to understand the most basic things about the aliens even more interesting.  Language and neuroscience play a fundamental role in the conflict that comes up.\n\nEnjoy!",

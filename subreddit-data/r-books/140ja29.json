    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nMy approach to reading books used to be: \"The right way to read books is from start to finish.\" I felt that \"it doesn't count\" if I don't read from cover to cover. Most of my reading bouts were tedious, I was basically powering through books, using willpower. It felt a lot like work, a lot of the time. I remember toiling away at Thinking Fast and Slow and coming out of the battle victorious with an \"I have read Thinking Fast and Slow\" badge in my mind.\n\nA big turning point in my relationship with reading came when I read Almanack of Naval Ravikant. He said he rarely reads books from start to finish. He said he jumps around, reads only as long as a book keeps his interest, and even said books can be treated as throw-away blog posts.\n\nThis hit me hard. It was a revelation of sorts. But most importantly, perhaps, I was given permission to not read all books from start to finish and be more flexible. I used to think that all the smart people read books from cover to cover meticulously. Well, not ALL of them, I found. Here's a smart guy confessing that he has dozens of books \"in progress\", simultaneously.\n\nFrankly, that has always been my natural way of reading books: usually many books \"in progress\" at a time. But I used to feel bad about it. I felt something was wrong about it. \"Can't I finish a damn book before I jump to the next one?\" A voice in my head was probably bitching in the background. Likely a part of me was concerned that it's an indication of laziness, lack of discipline and willpower.\n\nI'd say, after changing my mindset around reading, it has become a more enjoyable activity and probably way more productive too. If I find out the book is crap or irrelevant, I stop and I read another book. As a result, I keep reading, instead of becoming a non-reader who's waiting for a buildup of willpower to do another arduous bout of mechanical reading.\n\nI'm making a case against forcing oneself to finish books. Let's fight this disease perpetuated by Goodreads Reading Challenges (Btw, I love Goodreads, lol) and \"CEOs read one book a week\" headlines. Books finished is a metric that may peak your dopamine levels and impress other people but in reality it says nothing about how much you learned from reading and how much you enjoyed the process. Focusing on this metric is yet another way we humans bully ourselves.\n\nIn fact, this metric is counterproductive if one wants to develop a genuine love for reading and read more. This kind of bullying approach to reading just creates negative associations with reading such as \"struggle\", \"laboring\", \"pain\". Reading becomes a \"should\" which probably creates subconscious resistance towards the activity.\n\nSo the solution: don't waste your precious time on shitty books (or highly acclaimed ones that put you to sleep), throw them away and follow your genuine curiosity.\n\nI'm curious what you think!",

It\u2019s exactly the kind of reading I\u2019d expect from a CEO.",

I also find it interesting to hear about why someone put down books I've enjoyed. I also think that, if a book is getting abandoned left, right, and center, that probably says something about the book and whatever it is about that book that causes people to DNF it is something that is valid to review.\n\nPushing through to the end has never changed my opinion for the better for a book I was considering putting down and I see so many people talking about how they regret pushing through in order to say they finished it. I don't really see it as a valuable use of a reviewer's time if they're just plodding through hundreds of pages so they can state the opinion they already have without offending people.",

The objective there is just to waste some time before doing something else, so skipping entire chapters will not change anything. More power to you.\n\nIf you read exclusively for learning real life skills, you DO NOT SKIP ANYTHING. You have no idea how many people make terrible mistakes because they take things out of context all the time in a book. In the academic field, context is everything. A small detail could change the meaning of an entire paper. Also, smart people rarely learn from books, they learn from peer reviewed papers or thesis. It's really hard to find errors on those things. Books, specially \"entrepreneur\" books are usually made from underpayed ghost writers for people that will never aquire true money.\n\nIf you read because you have a burning passion for literature... I mean, you COULD skip, but why would you? Sure, not every single piece of fiction will be exciting, but every single word teaches you something. Context, subtext, the beauty of the prose itself... skipping will just make you understand a completely different thing than the author intended. Discussing a book with someone that skips entire chapters or fragments is... not pleasurable at all.",

I don't think reading has to be some form of intellectual pursuit every time you crack open a cover. I think reading should be whatever you want it to be.

They're mostly just grift, first step to being smarter, not to get suckered. Usually when people talk about loving reading, they mean fiction. Ditching rubbish, and ditching tracking, are two seperate things. I'm not really sure what you're expecting, with the ideas about what 'smart people' do or don't. Academics absolutely read material relevant to their field without skipping on grounds of boredom or because it's hard to frame what they're learning clearly and/or in terms of practical usefulness (mostly books aren't easy to demonstrate the instant usefulness of. Try knitting pattern books if you want that? Seriously, you'd be better off with books that teach a specific skill than vague CEO advice. What actual qualifications do these 'smart people' have?). You won't find a magic formula but can choose to gradually build up knowledge, especially of a specific subject (which may or may not be useful), but not by reading books like you really just want a summary.\n\n(How about trying some classic fiction about the American Dream, instead of the American Dream repackaged as self-help?)\n\nI agree tracking isn't neccesary (and the figures needn't say much about the kind of books read), but some people like to, and a book a week is really not a lot. I mean, think about it, here you're seemingly not that used to reading, and you're struggling, while you're effectively putting down people who are just reading without really even thinking about it (even if they are tracking), purely on the hypothetical it might lead to *them* struggling..meanwhile they'll have been doing it for years and that hasn't happened. Maybe there's something in their approach after all?",

    "postText": "It's even better than I remember it being!\n\nI know there's a kind of air of suspicion surrounding this text nowadays. \n\nFirst, of course, because of Achebe's essay, we can't really talk about HoD without talking about this at least once. And...yeah, I'll concede that although some of Conrad's description comes off as racist for us, we shouldn't forget that there's also the strong anti-colonial impulse of this book. In fact, it's raison d'etre. \n\nWe shouldn't also forget that Marlowe, as a character in the book, is not a perfect stand-in for Conrad. We're getting the story filtered through two voices, and at times, the narrator (not Marlowe, the actual unnamed narrator of the novel) criticises Marlowe's style of narration. \n\nThere are also parts where I could feel that the author was \"psychoanalyzing racism\", so to speak, of Marlowe. One of these is here:\n\n&gt;It was unearthly, and the men\r were\u2014\u2013 No, they were not inhuman. Well, you know,\r that was the worst of it\u2014this suspicion of their not\r being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They\r howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces;\r but what thrilled you was just the thought of their\r humanity\u2014like yours\u2014the thought of your remote\r kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly.\r Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough\r you would admit to yourself that there was in you just\r the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness\r of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning\r in it which you\u2014you so remote from the night of first\r ages\u2014could comprehend. And why not? The mind of\r man is capable of anything\u2014because everything is in\r it, all the past as well as all the future. What was there\r after all? Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valour, rage\u2014\r who can tell?\u2014but truth truth stripped of its cloak of\r time.\n\nThis, to me, seems like a powerful analysis of the contradictions of racism. And at the same time, I think it's gorgeous prose.\n\nWhich brings me to the second reason why this book is now suspect: English being Conrad's third language. Many readers -- admirers and critics alike -- have charged Conrad with writing overwrought, melodramatic, and clunky English. And with sentences such as:\n\n&gt; \u201cIt was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention.\u201d \n\nit's rather difficult to ignore this accusation. But as [this New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/11/06/the-trouble-with-heart-of-darkness) points out, \"Read in isolation, some of Conrad\u2019s sentences are certainly a howl, but one reads them in isolation only in criticism like Leavis\u2019s or Achebe\u2019s. Reading the tale straight through, I lost my discomfort after twenty pages or so and fell hopelessly under Conrad\u2019s spell.\"\n\nWhich I found to be absolutely true! I don't think I can explain it very well, but otherwise clunky and ridiculous-sounding sentences don't exactly stick out when you read HoD cover to cover.\n\nSome excerpts that I would mention in defence of Conrad:\n\n&gt;The tidal current runs\r to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with\r memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of\r home or to the battles of the sea. It had known and\r served all the men of whom the nation is proud, from\r Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all,\r titled and untitled\u2014the great knights-errant of the sea.\r It had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels\r flashing in the night of time, from the Golden Hind\r returning with her round flanks full of treasure, to be\r visited by the Queen\u2019s Highness and thus pass out of\r the gigantic tale, to the Erebus and Terror, bound on\r other conquests\u2014and that never returned. It had\r known the ships and the men. They had sailed from\r Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith\u2014the\r adventurers and the settlers; kings\u2019 ships and the ships\r of men on \u2019Change; captains, admirals, the dark\r \u201cinterlopers\u201d of the Eastern trade, and the\r commissioned \u201cgenerals\u201d of East India fleets. Hunters\r for gold or pursuers of fame, they all had gone out on\r that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch,\r messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a\r spark from the sacred fire. What greatness had not\r floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an\r unknown earth! . . . The dreams of men, the seed of\r commonwealths, the germs of empires.\n\nAnd here we have a famous one:\n\n&gt;Going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings. An empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest. The air was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish. There was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine. The long stretches of the waterway ran on, deserted, into the gloom of overshadowed distances. On silvery sand-banks hippos and alligators sunned themselves side by side. The broadening waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands; you lost your way on that river as you would in a desert, and butted all day long against shoals, trying to find the channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for ever from everything you had known once\u2014somewhere\u2014far away\u2014in another existence perhaps.\n\nBut keeping the prose style aside, there's a lot to be gained in the book in other aspects as well. There's Kurtz -- the man, the legend, the phantasm. I think it's masterful how Conrad narrates his story: it's non-linear, fragmented, but still carries its power of tragedy. The text as often cited as an early example of modernism, and I think it is because of this style of narration. Kurtz haunts the whole novel, though we see him in only the final part, and hear very little from him, and most of what we hear is kind of nonsense.\n\nThe last scene, where Marlowe goes to meet Kurtz's fiancee, is also quite powerful. Again, this is lambasted by many readers as being too mawkish, but I love it. I think it's an amazing ending to the novel. \n\nAnyhoo, I'm done fanboying. Curious to know your thoughts!",

But he wrote in an era when colonialism was becoming increasingly untenable, so he was pretty spot on. \n\nAnd an outsider to the system, he seems to have seen it before others did. For example, *Heart of Darkness* was published in 1899, and conditions in the Congo didn\u2019t improve at all until 1908. Conrad wasn\u2019t the only one who wrote about it, but he was one of the earliest.",

Quoting Wikipedia:\n\n&gt;The first international protest [regarding the Congo] occurred in 1890 when George Washington Williams, an American, published an open letter to Leopold about abuses he had witnessed. In a letter to the United States Secretary of State, he described conditions in the Congo as \"crimes against humanity\", thus coining the phrase, which would later become key language in international law. Public interest in the abuses in the Congo Free State grew sharply from 1895, when the Stokes Affair and reports of mutilations reached the European and American public which began to discuss the \"Congo Question\". To appease public opinion, Leopold instigated a Commission for the Protection of Natives (Commission pour la Protection des Indig\u00e8nes), composed of foreign missionaries, but made few serious efforts at substantive reform.\n\n&gt;In the United Kingdom, the campaign was led by the activist and pamphleteer E. D. Morel after 1900, whose book Red Rubber (1906) reached a mass audience. Notable members of the campaign included the novelists Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad and Arthur Conan Doyle as well as Belgian socialists such as Emile Vandervelde. In May 1903 a debate in the British House of Commons led to the passing of a resolution in condemnation of the Congo Free State. A few days later the British consul in the town of Boma, Roger Casement, began touring the Congo to investigate the true extent of the abuses. He delivered his report in December, and a revised version was forwarded to the Free State authorities in February 1904.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrocities_in_the_Congo_Free_State",

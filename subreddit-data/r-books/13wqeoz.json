I mean, they straight-up approach them about testing out their \u201candroid-detecting tests\u201d on the new models\u2026 why not just try to take them down so you don\u2019t have to deal with the androids anymore?!&lt; I\u2019m rereading it for the first time in a good 6 years so this question is really bugging me at the moment",

They were economically and spiritually critical to the social order of the planet.   \nBesides, Bryant wouldn't have had a job if the andriods didn't stop rebelling... he wasn't the kind of guy to sabotage his own self-interest.",

            "comment": "That's like going after Ford because vehicles have car accidents. Replicants represent a ton of labor that has no human rights. They're slaves. It's the same reason plantation owners fought so hard to preserve chattel slavery in the 19th century. It's the same reason slavery persists today. Cheap labor with no rights is so profitable you can build an economy on it.\n\nAs for the replicant testing... my understanding was that the trouble with the Voight-Kampff test in the movie (I don't remember if the book is the same) was that it could only show that you were *probably* a replicant. (What was the term they used? \"Anomalous\" or something?) It could never prove you were human. We don't know what the false positive and false negative rates really are. That means it's really any better than a lie detector or an IQ test or a psych evaluation. Good enough for a job interview or to gatekeep security clearance, but not good enough for life or death. After all, Deckard presumably passed the same Voight-Kampff test himself in order to be a blade runner, and he develops doubts that he might be a replicant himself. The only definitive test was the bone test, and those are supposed to be usually done after death.\n\nThe other issue with the Voight-Kampff test is another problem with lie detector tests. You have to have a willing participant. It's a test that if you take it and fail, then you have no human rights. Why would you ever subject yourself to that willingly if you know they're looking for a reason to kill you if you're a replicant? If they refuse... well, then what?",

                    "comment": "The issue of false-positives is in the book. When Deckard first visits the Rosen Company he is invited to first interview Rachael Rosen. Afterwards he is told she has grown up on a star ship with little contact of other people:\n\n&gt;Eldon Rosen said huskily. \"The issue is that your empathy delineation test failed in response to my niece. I can explain why she scored as an android might. Rachael grew up aboard Salander 3. She was born on it; she spent fourteen of her eighteen years living off its tape library and what the nine other crew members, all adults, knew about Earth. Then, as you know, the ship turned back a sixth of the way to Proxima. Otherwise Rachael would never have seen Earth -- anyhow not until her later life.\"\n\n---\n\n&gt;\"In other words,\" Rick said with acuity, \"I'm not going to be given a chance to check out a single Nexus-6. You people dropped this schizoid girl on me beforehand.\" And my test, he realized, is wiped out. I shouldn't have gone for it, he said to himself. However, it's too late now.\n\nFor reasons they try to bribe him with an owl but before he goes he asks one last question:\n\n&gt;As Rachael started to close the door after herself and her uncle, Rick said starkly, \"You managed to set me up perfectly. You have it on tape that I missed on you; you know that my job depends on the use of the Voigt-Kampff scale; and you own that goddamn owl.\"\n\n&gt;\"Your owl, dear,\" Rachael said. \"Remember? We'll tie your home address around its leg and have it fly down to San Francisco; it'll meet you there when you get off work.\"\n\n&gt;It, he thought. She keeps calling the owl it. Not her. \"Just a second,\" he said.\n\n&gt;Pausing at the door, Rachael said, \"You've decided?\"\n\n&gt;\"I want,\" he said, opening his briefcase, \"to ask you one more question from the Voigt-Kampff scale. Sit down again.\"\n\n&gt;Rachael glanced at her uncle; he nodded and she grudgingly returned, seating herself as before. \"What's this for?\" she demanded, her eyebrows lifted in distaste -- and wariness. He perceived her skeletal tension, noted it professionally.\n\n&gt;Presently he had the pencil of light trained on her right eye and the adhesive patch again in contact with her check. Rachael stared into the light rigidly, the expression of extreme distaste still manifest.\n\n&gt;\"My briefcase,\" Rick said as he rummaged for the Voigt-Kampff forms. \"Nice, isn't it? Department issue.\"\n\n&gt;\"Well, well,\" Rachael said remotely.\n\n&gt;\"Babyhide,\" Rick said. He stroked the black leather surface of the briefcase. \"One hundred percent genuine human babyhide.\" He saw the two dial indicators gyrate frantically. But only after a pause. The reaction had come, but too late. He knew the reaction period down to a fraction of a second, the correct reaction period; there should have been none. \"Thanks, Miss Rosen,\" he said, and gathered together the equipment again; he had concluded his retesting. \"That's all.\"\n\n&gt;\"You're leaving?\" Rachael asked.\n\n&gt;\"Yes,\" he said. \"I'm satisfied.\"\n\n&gt;Cautiously, Rachael said, \"What about the other nine subjects?\"\n\n&gt;\"The scale has been adequate in your case,\" he answered. \"I can extrapolate from that; it's clearly still effective.\" To Eldon Rosen, who slumped morosely by the door of the room, he said, \"Does she know?\" Sometimes they didn't; false memories had been tried various times, generally in the mistaken idea that through them reactions to testing would be altered.",

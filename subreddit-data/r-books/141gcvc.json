    "postText": "My language arts teacher had everyone read this book for an end of school project and I say I really love this book.  (LA is my favorite class too, since the teacher is very nice and I actually got a very high A as my final average). I really recommend everyone read this book and I think it's extremely underrated this deserves to be picked up by some major film studio like Universal or Warner Bros and shown on the big screen.\n\nThe characters are just written so well but what I really love is that this book tells 2 stories at once, like the hidden bigger story is about the Congo as a whole.  The best detail when I finally realized what was going on is the fact that Ruth May literally died the same day Patrice Lumumba did!!!  No way this was NOT intentional.\n\nI also just like Leah's character development, at first she honestly annoyed me as the typical daddy's girl but I love how she actually learned to think for herself and now she's in a healthy relationship with Anatole.  I also like how religion is actually portrayed in this book too, especially Nathan Price's mindset and how it ended up damning him and Ruth May.\n\nI literally want to make an animation meme so badly with this too (not that I'll succeed I don't even know how to animate lol.)",

I read it years ago and still think of it occasionally. \n\nWhile I was reading it and for a bit after, I walked around in awe of mundane things I'd never thought about. I was astonished at hot and cold running water and amazed that I could just walk across the street and buy a Pepsi any time.\n\nThe biggest thing was realizing how incredibly lucky I am to live somewhere in the world where I have a reasonable expectation of safety at all times. I go to bed at night feeling certain I'll wake up in the morning. I go outside without considering I may be shot, because that's very unlikely. So many people in the world can't say those things. I feel both immensely lucky for myself and sad and concerned for them.",

And were keen to share with the locals their modern methods. They didn't like how chicken they bought in the local market was so tough. The local chickens were allowed to wander around.  So they made a chicken coop and put some chickens in, the restricted access they were sure would mean tender chicken. Overnight they heard some terrible squeals. In the morning they found all their chickens had been eaten alive by ants.",

I've genuinely considered either hosting a multi-animator project (it's actually smarter to do that, since more skilled people will do a majority of the work while I just pick the easiest part for myself.) or just paying someone but as a minor I don't really have the money to commission people.",

I connect with the part about how much the dad changes and bases a lot of his values on his trauma from the war.   You hear now about how there really was generational trauma from those soldiers coming back and just being expected to pick life back up like nothing happened.   It's very well written to be a story about the family and how he expects everyone to obey him and his religion but really a story about the Congo.  The entire country had generational trauma over their being treated like children who needed to just obey (though with more violence than the family).",

    "postText": "I finished reading this book and it was so well written that I finished it in one evening. I'm reading it for summer reading before I attend college and, for those who have read it, I am wondering why the college assigned it. Is it because it is young adult? A lesson that mistakes do not haunt us? Everyone drastically changes from when they are a teen to becoming an adult? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",

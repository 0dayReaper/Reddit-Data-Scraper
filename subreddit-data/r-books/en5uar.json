I just don't get how this is a problem unless you're trying to complete a set and want them to look the same, I get that\n\nI have started to see and hear people complain all over again about the Witcher series now they have released the books with Henry Cavil on the cover. Why is it a problem? Have you ever seen someone reading a book with a movie cover and thought less of them for only reading / discovering it because there's a movie? Cause of you have that says more about you than them.\n\nIt's still the same book though the content hasn't changed. I just don't see how people can care how you discovered the series rather than be excited that someone else shares their passion. \n\nNeeded to get this off my chest lol.",

It only annoys me inasmuch as if I'm looking for a certain book in my bookstore and they only have the movie cover version I won't buy it. But other than that IDC, it's all subjective.",

                    "comment": "Same! I read books for the content, but the main reason I *buy* them (instead of borrowing) is honestly as home decor. I just really like having lots of books around me, and I especially love the ones with pretty covers.   \nMovie covers often look kind of dated a couple years later, especially when the movie/show never became very popular, and it just looks like a bad stock photo. Instead, I prefer the classic look with a more abstract or illustrative cover. Obviously, this all comes down to personal preference, but I think it's a common complaint because lots of people find the photo covers to be unattractive.\n\nThat said, I've also been wanting to buy the Witcher books, and man those covers are all ugly! The pre-TV show ones either come with screenshots from the games (which I don't even mind too much, but the design around them looks like some intern did it...), or the whole cover is a realistic drawing of a person in monochrome color (almost as bad as stock photos) - with half of them showing half-naked ladies.    \nIt just kinda screams \"some stereotypical, cookie-cutter fantasy series you've never heard of\".        \nSo basically, I'm hoping that the show becomes *so* incredibly popular that they'll release some kind of collector's edition with pretty covers at some point... In the meantime, I'm enjoying the audio books. \n\nAs an aside, another book that it's impossible to find a nice-looking, non-movie edition of is High-rise. I've been searching for that for years! Ironically, ever since... watching the movie. Oh well.",

In that sense, the paper the words are printed on is, conceptually speaking, a pretty important part of the whole thing as once a book's condition deteriorates too far it is no longer functionally sharable/readable. However in the age of mass production and  digitalization that's decreasingly the case.\n\nAlso there is nothing wrong with appreciating the aesthetics of a physical book in and of themselves and, as such, disliking when they are damaged.",

The disposessed? Lanky tall African american moon person. Circe? Dark olive-skinned powerful woman in her mid-thirties, aged and hardened with cracked skin from the ocean air. Movie covers invariably have some airbrushed generic attractive actor from central casting that is so bland I cannot get the image out of the way of the story. The reason I'm reading BOOKS is because I want to cast ppl in my own head. Doesnt help when the movies are usually awful with tacky visual identity so that tints it too (cue a whisper in time poster here)",

Like putting the Carla Guigino from the Netflix series of \"The Haunting of Hill House\" on the Shirley Jackson books cover... when that character doesn't even exist in the book, not to mention how completely different the book and the TV series are.\n\nOr putting Jack Nicholson's mug on The Shining, considering that again the movie and the novel are different and Stephen King famously dislikes the movie.\n\nFinally I think the movie covers are usually shoddily done. It's just the name actor front and center with little thought for aesthetics. I am sure if they shot the covers with as much creativity and care as other book covers, it'd be very well received.",

The book was also my first experience reading a book that's told through the eyes of someone going crazy, and having their  loss of reality effect the information that you receive as a reader.\n\nI'm going to start \"The Turn of the Screw\" next, before they slap \"The Haunting of Hill House\" season 2 promo on the books.\n\n\"The Shining\" isn't as egregious when you're looking at the editions that have just the door with \"redrum\" written on it, but having aspects of the movie which are completely different than what's contained in the novel I.E., Nicholson, it starts taking away from my enjoyment of the experience of reading that edition of the book.",

The movie lets you relax and enjoy the product of director\u2019s imagination, all you need to do is literally sit and watch. The book is very different because there is always a cooperation between the author and you - author tells you stuff, but it\u2019s your job to imagine it and visualise in your head. This is work, but that\u2019s what makes reading exciting.\n\nNow, to your question. I\u2019m one of the people who hate movie-related covers on the books. Mostly because they create a very strong anchor for the reader\u2019s imagination even before he opened the book itself. I find it unfair to the authors, insulting for the readers and actually degrading to the reading experience.",

If my own mother went missing and I had to give the police sketch artist a description, we would never find her.  Similarly if the police said, \"We're looking for a criminal, she looks like *insert exact description of my mother*\" I would probably not make the connection.\n\nSo I like when I already know what a character looks like.  It means I don't have to waste time trying to envision the author's verbose description of someone's mustache, which ends up distracting me from the story.",

If I sit here and focus on it, I can imagine a person sitting on a couch, but the person is sort of an amorphous dark outline unless select and place someone I have seen before into the scene. Even then, I flicker in and out of the imagine, I can't hold it for more than half-second glimpses at a time.\n\nI'm mostly interested in the idea of generating a new person. That's wild to me. When I read about a character in a work of fiction, I *never* visualize them fully. I have an impression of them and then maybe 1-2 defining characteristics that come to mind as facts along with that impression each time they come up. For example, from the Wheel of Time, Rand has red hair, Perrin has a muscular build, and Matt is lanky. That's what I think of when characters show up in scenes. Just the impression.",

I'm simply a fan of books with a minimalist design, or some kind of unique pattern or artwork that is based on something in the book itself. \n\nWhy am I opposed to it? For me it just seems like a way to sell copies; less on the merits of the book, more on the merits of the movie. The two are separate.

I miss when they were stickers you could actually take off. I just wanted a copy that looked like the one I owned in high school, well before the show came out. \n\nAs for photos of the actors- I truly can\u2019t stand having a book cover replaced with the movie cover because many times I\u2019ve already read the book and pictured the characters a certain way. It entirely ruins my connection to the world the author created and how I interpreted that creation. I won\u2019t watch The Book Thief because of it. The actress they picked looks nothing like how I envisioned Liesel. \n\nI also think the author\u2019s choice of illustrator and cover art is a very personal choice to the author. It is, after all, what is representing and selling their book (and who amongst us hasn\u2019t judged a book by its cover?). I think using promotional photos from the show/movie cheapens this.\n\nAlso no, I would never judge someone for reading a book with a movie cover. I just personally, as a person who buys a lot of books, despise it as a trend because it makes it a lot harder for me to find books that don\u2019t look absolutely tacky as hell for my collection.\n\nQuick edit: also, as a library employee a new cover usually means new ISBN which means new record set which only confuses patrons when they go to request a book that has been made in to a popular movie/show. So we end up with a large amount of holds on the new copy when another record with more copies exists, frustrated patrons because of long wait times, and frustrated me.",

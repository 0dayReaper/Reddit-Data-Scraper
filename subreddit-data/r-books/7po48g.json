Primarily they went to prisons, because that was the only way they were allowed to get books to a prisoner: from a store. Supposedly it stopped contraband. (Still had a ton of rules and we verified all books/magazines fell within guidelines: no hardcover books, no girly mags, etc.)\n\nA friend who was in prison some years back got regular \"letters\" from friends/family: photocopied pages from D&amp;D manuals. Slowly though, as they had a limit as to how many pages they could receive in letters.",

But the prison I'm talking about banned D&amp;D because of fears \"it could lead to gang behavior and fantasies about escape.\" Other prisons in other states have banned not only D&amp;D, but all role playing games and Magic: the Gathering for similar bullshit reasons. (I had a friend in lockup who'd get me to mail him photocopies of new MtG sets so he and his jail-mates could make decks and play until it was banned, and no, the ban wasn't because he was violating WotC's intellectual property rights.)*\n\nSource of Quote - http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/us/27dungeons.html\n\nMore sources on request for anyone interested.",

            "comment": "Book Store employee here. I understand the need to keep contraband out of the prison, but that's why we have put such great lengths to work with the prisons.\n\nWhen I first started this is how we sent books to prisons:\n\n1. Friend or family member of inmate came into the store and spoke with a salesperson about which books they wanted.\n\n2. After settling the list of desired books sales person would order the books to be sent directly from our warehouse to the prison. There was absolutely no room for contraband to be smuggled into the book.\n\nThe problem with this one?  Our warehouses would sometimes use UPS and sometimes use USPS. There were some prisons which would only accept USPS packages and would return the book or just not deliver it to the inmate.\n\nAfter we threw this method out we experimented with a lot of different methods at once it seems.\n\nWe encouraged customers to have a print of of the prison's mail rules so we would know EXACTLY how to comply with them, but this maybe worked twice. Most people coming in are embarrassed about having a loved one in prison and just want to get the books sent, not do homework before shopping. (Because I've picked up on this embarrassment so often one of the first things I do now is reassure the person that they've come to the right person because I do this ALL THE TIME. It seems to put them at ease that others have to do the same thing.)\n\nHere's how to do prison deliveries now (We ended up having to take the strictest rules from all of the experimental methods to make sure every prison would get every package to the inmate without fuss.):\n\n\n1. Friend or family member of the inmate comes into the store and speaks with a salesperson about which books they want.\n\n2. Sales person makes sure that the customer has a membership with the store. If they don't we inform them that all people wishing to send books to correctional facilities must have a membership. This is actually good for both sides for multiple reasons.\n\n             a. A membership gets the customer free shipping and handling. As most people come in to do this several times a year, this usually ends up saving them money in the long run even though the membership has a cost.\n             b. Now that they are on file we have their name, phone number, and mailing address. It gives us a way to contact the customer if any hiccups happen after they leave.\n             c. It helps us save a bit of money on the extra costs that prison deliveries have come to have.\n \n3. After store membership is confirmed, and after settling on the list of desired books, the sales person orders the books to be sent directly from our warehouse to the STORE. This means there's no way for contraband to be smuggled, and since we at the store level can't communicate with the warehouses which shipping method to use, we have it sent to us and then we send it out again using USPS. (Which all prisons seems to accept.)\n\n3. We have the customer write down the shipping address in their own handwriting. We had too many troubles with computers reformatting the addresses and making the package go nowhere and with people guessing the addresses, getting it wrong, and blaming it on us. Now, IT'S YOUR HANDWRITING! WE DIDN'T DO IT!\n\n4. Sales person takes a picture of the order details, the customer's membership information, and the shipping address and texts it to every manager to keep an eye out for.\n\n5. Sales person prints a copy of the receipt, staples it to the shipping address, and puts it on a cork board in the office at the end of their shift.\n\n6. When the package arrives at the store, we notify a manager that a prison deliver package has arrived. Once we've located which receipt matches either the contents of the box or the name on the shipping receipt, we double check that all items are present. If not all the items are present we keep the package individually wrapped in the locked office until the rest arrives. If all item are present we remove the old shipping information and replace it with the shipping information that the customer left with us and use our rubber stamp of the store's address as the return address to let prison mail inspectors know that this really did come from a retailer, not an individual.\n\n7. The next day after we go to the bank we drop off all prison delivery packages with the USPS post office.\n\n\nAll that to say, that if a store is willing to go through all that, I think any prison should count them as an approved retailer and let anyone send books to any inmate.",

Most people work paycheck to paycheck and don't have any wiggle room to complain or \"vote with their dollar\". Education costs so much that even college graduates don't have much wiggle room to complain and are living paycheck to paycheck. Our voting system has been broken forever (electoral college abuse) and there is no option on any ballots in any public election, currently, that allows us to reform the system entirely. What do we do? Storm the government buildings and demand change? Or just loosely organize yelling in large groups with shit looking signs that say vague empty phrases? Theres nothing we can do. The police are armed to the teeth with military grade weaponry, we can't physically fight back. Don't blame the American people, we've been fucked by capitalism.

They had one guy to watch the 50 inmates lol. We had them packaging from pallets slippers and small clothing. They had another guy who came in briefly once or twice during the shift who was with the county. It felt really really weird as a temp making $8.25 at the time being a \"supervisor\" on a night shift with inmates. We didn't interact with them unless the attendant had a question. In their own part of the warehouse. Due to sanitary concerns that arose the following shift we stopped that program after 2 weeks. They were peeing all over the bathrooms.",

They are required to be classified as community control (one level lower than minimum security), so are the least likely to have behavioral issues. There will always be some bad actors that bluff their way into the program but that happens everywhere, even in law enforcement. Too bad that everyone lost an opportunity due to a few jerks.",

People with short sentences (less than 5 years) go to the JRCF. Everyone else goes to the USDB. Most of the people who go to the JRCF are there for a few days or weeks. Think of it as a city or county jail. Since most of these people were not going to be processed out of the service, they were given the task of refurbishing the helmets. The fabric casings were made by people at the USDB (think of it as a federal prison). Trustees (sic) from the USDB were charged with quality control of the helmets, installing the fabric cover, and boxing and shipping the final product. The helmets were noticed to be faulty by the Trustees. They make $1 an hour. The other people start at 15 cents and can work up to 80 cents. It could be argued that having someone who makes 15 cents an hour make equipment for literally the person standing between them and their liberty is probably not the best idea. ",

I had to pay 140/week just to be on the work release block and I haven\u2019t seen a penny from my leftover pay (I have been out almost a year now). That being said, I had it good (12/hour). A local trash collection company has a contract with the prison and they hire 80-90% of the work release people and pay them minimum wage 7.25/hour regardless of the position. So there were guys riding the back of the trucks making the same amount as a diesel mechanic. It was nice to get out, and since my sentence wasn\u2019t very long, I\u2019d say I got a good deal. \n\nWhile that is not slave labor, the people on the work block (not work release block) who work inside the prison, they are essentially slaves. You get 14/week when you have a \u201cjob\u201d in the jail. Whether it be serving food, cleaning up blood/cum/shit/vomit, kitchen, laundry or landscaping (if you want to call it that). \n\nTo put it in perspective, 14/week gives you just enough money to buy jack shit from commissary. Just enough to make you starve a little bit less. Luckily I had a good lawyer who convinced the judge to let me stay out for another month to make some cash so I wouldn\u2019t go there broke, so I had plenty of money to buy junk food and what not. They also charge you 50 dollars just to go to jail and if you don\u2019t have it when you are booked, it comes out of your pay.\n\nMy opinion on how they get away with this is due to the fact that it\u2019s not about the pay. It\u2019s about getting off your block for most of the day, or in my case, get on a bus and leave that bitch for the day. It helps you forget you\u2019re an inmate when you\u2019re working on the outside. \n\nJail sucks. Like I said I was only in county but it\u2019s not a nice county. Right outside of a major city. I was looking at state time (state prison with death row and shit) but my lawyer brokered a pretty expensive yet good deal. I\u2019m on parole for the next 4+ years but I\u2019m finally getting over the fact that I came within inches of ruining my life, instead I just severely inconvenienced myself for the next few years. \n\nMy story is long and I don\u2019t feel like typing it all so I\u2019ll just leave it at don\u2019t drink and drive. Those \u201cdui you can\u2019t afford it\u201d signs are the truth. Shit cost me about 30 grand and fucked my family/friend/relationships up. Get an Uber. It\u2019s cheaper than 30 grand and you don\u2019t go to jail.",

Once we were there we were immediately put on the line sorting recyclables. Mind you, this is the dead of winter. It is windy and snowing and no matter how many layers you put on, you\u2019re still cold down to your bones. The center is open to the elements. There are 3 guys walking around whose sole job is to find people who stop sorting and scream in their faces like a drill sergeant. \u201cGET BACK TO WORK YOU UGLY PUSSY PIECE OF SHIT!\u201d After a few hours they call you for your first 15 minute break. But no one is allowed to have a watch and they have to make their daily tally. So the 15 minute breaks get shortened to around 5 minute breaks because.. fuck them, they\u2019re inmates. Back to work, everything is disgusting and smells horrible, the PPE they DO give you is horrendous. The disgusting trash soaks right through the cloth gloves that they give you. We get hardhats though. Hardhats that SAY on them that they are not hardhats. They are \u201cbump caps\u201d because they don\u2019t meet OSHA standard for what a hardhats is supposed to be. So we\u2019re making our way to our second break. By now you\u2019re covered in this garbage. It has soaked through every cloth on your body. But hey, another 15 minute break! Time to get warm! But no, just as soon as you get downstairs they push you all back up like cattle because there\u2019s \u201cNo time\u201d. So we\u2019re back to work. It\u2019s lunch time. They don\u2019t trust us to eat all at once so we stagger. I had to go first. I go downstairs, covered in filth and the only bathrooms are port o potty\u2019s. There is no where to wash off. So you sit down to eat your bagged lunch which is a bologna sandwich and a piece of fruit. And you\u2019re eating the garbage that you have been sorting. It\u2019s needles and shit and puke and anything that you can imagine, going from your fingers right onto your bologna sandwich. Which you eat 6 days a week. After (less than) 30 minutes you\u2019re back to work. But you ate at 11am so you\u2019re definitely going to be starving by the time we leave, AND there are no more (shortened) breaks. It\u2019s just you and the freezing cold until 6pm. If you have to use the bathroom it\u2019s timed and they strip search you before you can even go in. No more than 5 minutes. Any more than twice per day and it\u2019s excessive and you\u2019ll be fired. I thought I was going to get frostbite. You can\u2019t feel your hands or toes and you\u2019re not sure if you ever will again. But hey, we made it to 6pm! We get to go back to the jail and relax! No, not really. Wait an hour for the bus. 40 minute drive back. Wait in line for an hour to be strip searched and dehumanized all over again. Everyone fighting for a phone to call their loved ones, everyone fighting for the shower to wash off the disease. Everyone fighting to use a washing machine to wash our clothes. Most guys are so tired they just fall asleep right then and there, dirty clothes and all, and I can\u2019t blame them. But hey! It\u2019s time to sleep, right? Wrong. The CO\u2019s come in and do a contraband check. First thing they say is how terrible you and everything you own smells. They toss everything you own around and you have to spend the evening sorting it out of they\u2019ll take away your good time and you\u2019ll be there for longer. But surely we can go to sleep NOW? No. You have to clean the entire unit. Mops and all. Now, FINALLY you get to sleep. It\u2019s almost midnight. You lay down and just as you start to fall asleep all of the lights come on. It\u2019s shift change. Head count. We have to change back into our jail jumper for count. Takes 20-30 minutes. But after THAT.. yes. You get to sleep from 12:30am-4am. And you get to wake up and do it all over again. 6 days a week. That place is hell and I still have nightmares.",

And IIRC, these particular prisons are undergoing a *state-run* pilot program to see how book purchasing systems work to restrict contraband (reading between the lines, this also allows state facilities to restrict access to content they don't want inmates reading by simply making it difficult for inmates to financially access certain books rather than banning those books and more directly running afoul of the 1A).\n\nThe reality of the prison industrial complex is that, while the prisons themselves are rarely privately owned (something like 8-9% of state prisons across the country), it's the *services in those prisons* that are very, very commonly privately operated. Medical care is a particularly egregious example, for the simple fact that it is designed to make a profit at these facilities, so they try to treat as few people as possible and to treat them as minimally and briefly as possible. Horrible medical care cases have been coming out of *state*-run prison facilities. Another big one is food. The kitchens are getting privatized, and they're cutting every corner they can find. The food is getting saltier, fattier, less nutritional, and less hygienic. Maggots abound at these places. And the third one is phone communication. Families are paying out the ass to talk to an inmate for a minute at a time because these phone companies have figured out that phone time is like a drug -- it's got pretty much no overhead cost and it's an inelastic service that inmates and their families will pay virtually anything for.",

I agree with you that the contractors brought in for commissary, phone services, etc are all trying to squeeze as much out of people as possible but at least for us the County eats about half the cost on average.  But that's because a package of top ramen is $0.22 at Food 4 Less and commissary thinks it's okay to charge $1.50 for it.  So if the County gets grievances about it and wants the vendor to change the vendor just says fuck off and since they're contracted for a number of years the County just ends up agreeing to subsidize the cost to get it lower for the Inmates.  And so far at least we have but that's just putting additional costs on the tax payer while these contractors make hand over fist.\n\nAll that aside though I can empathize with someone deciding to cut off certain kinds of donations or groups.  For us deliveries have to come direct from an approved list of publishers or it has to come from one particular charity organization.  Who for us just happen to be the Catholics because no other religious or non-religious entity in our area proved trustworthy enough to not try and smuggle meth inside.",

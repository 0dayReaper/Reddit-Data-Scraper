Clearly he was mostly just pissed he had to pay $500 in taxes a year to support a service he didn't like, with a side bonus of getting a boost to his Amazon stocks. Typical mentality of follks: if I don't use it, it must be a wasted service and we should get rid of it!\n\nWell, Mr. Economist, I don't use the roads in front of your house. Let's get rid of those, too, I'm tired of my tax dollars supporting your driving habits.",

Besides all the events you mentioned it also has a bunch of teen centric events (like journaling, anime, and writing groups) as well as all-ages events like their monthly board games group. It also serves as a severely underappreciated homeless support service in the winter during daytime hours since it's one of the few places homeless people can come into and warm up without fear of being run off.\n\nIf I could direct all my taxes to my local schools and library I would elect to do that in a heartbeat. I don't even have kids but I believe that public schools and libraries are the most important services a community can offer and would love to support them even more then I already do.",

Their existing library is small, shitty and in need of some serious updating. There was a vote on whether or not the town should build a new library. \n\nPeople lost their god damned minds. It was like they were proposing public executions of every first born. People fought so hard against the library. There was a couple of popular reasons, but the most popular by far was \"I don't need it, so I don't want to pay for it.\"\n\nIt was really sad. The town did need either a new library or some serious work to the existing one. I follow your logic exactly, just because we don't use something, it benefits everyone in the community indirectly. \n\nIt's unfortunate because otherwise it's a nice community. We're looking to move in a year or two, but since we have kids and use the library it means we won't be buying in that town. \n\nI don't have pets, so why does my town need an animal control officer? I don't drive on Maple Street, so surely we don't need to clear the road after that hurricane. Why does my local PD need a flat bottom boat for search and rescue, I don't boat or swim in the lake. ",

Here's a snapshot I recovered using the [Internet Archive:](https://web.archive.org/web/20180722200130/https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/07/21/amazon-should-replace-local-libraries-to-save-taxpayers-money/)\n\n-----\n\n**Amazon Should Replace Local Libraries to Save Taxpayers Money**  \n^(Panos Mourdoukoutas, Contributor)  \n^(Jul 21, 2018, 09:00am  #GettingBuzz)  \n\n\nAmazon should open their own bookstores in all local communities. They can replace local libraries and save taxpayers lots of money, while enhancing the value of their stock. \n\nThere was a time local libraries offered the local community lots of services in exchange for their tax money. They would bring books, magazines, and journals to the masses through a borrowing system. Residents could borrow any book they wanted, read it, and return it for someone else to read.\n\nThey also provided residents with a comfortable place they could enjoy their books. They provided people with a place they could do their research in peace with the help of friendly librarians. Libraries served as a place where residents could hold their community events, but this was a function they shared with school auditoriums. There's no shortage of places to hold community events.\n\nLibraries slowly began to service the local community more. Libraries introduced video rentals and free internet access. The modern local library still provides these services, but they don't have the same value they used to. The reasons why are obvious.\n\nOne such reason is the rise of \"third places\" such as Starbucks. They provide residents with a comfortable place to read, surf the web, meet their friends and associates, and enjoy a great drink. This is why some people have started using their loyalty card at Starbucks more than they use their library card.\n\nOn top of this, streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have replaced video rentals. They provide TV and movie content to the masses at an affordable rate. Actual video rental services like Blockbuster have gone completely out of business.\n\nThen there's the rise of digital technology. Technology has turned physical books into collector's items, effectively eliminating the need for library borrowing services.\n\nOf course, there's Amazon Books to consider. Amazon have created their own online library that has made it easy for the masses to access both physical and digital copies of books. Amazon Books is a chain of bookstores that does what Amazon originally intended to do; replace the local bookstore. It improves on the bookstore model by adding online searches and coffee shops. Amazon Go basically combines a library with a Starbucks.\n\nAt the core, Amazon has provided something better than a local library without the tax fees. This is why Amazon should replace local libraries. The move would save taxpayers money and enhance the stockholder value of Amazon all in one fell swoop.\n\nMy recent book *The Ten Golden Rules Of Leadership* is published by AMACOM, and can be found here *[Amazon sales link redacted]*.\n\n-----\n\n**Edit:** Restored the last line of the article without the Amazon link, per /r/books rule #3.",

They offer classes in language, technology, finance, even writing, which may have benefited Mr. Mourdoukoutas.

They agree on a fixed annual fee that the city pays the company, and they also agree on what level of services they require (you must be open this many hours a week, you must provide these services, these are the policies and fee schedule, resident surveys must average this high, et cetera).  Residents are always worried that the private company will jack up fees and strip the shelves, but if the company does that it's because the city already sold you out.  Anyway, on an agreed-upon date the city employees take similar jobs with the company and the company takes over occupying and running the libraries.  \n\nAs for why a city would do this, basically money.  The library system becomes a fixed cost, and usually less than they're paying now.  The library contractors of course have an incentive to keep costs below their contracted fee, so they look for efficiencies in the system.  For example they might try to optimize business hours to reduce redundant staffing, or they can use the company's size to get quantity discounts on materials.  However, another big way they save money is by getting the staff off of the city payroll.  As you might imagine, private company emoyees don't get the job security and benefits package that city employees get.  ",

    "postText": "I\u2019m incredibly sad by the passing of John Prine, a wordsmith who managed the hardest of all lyricist obligations, managing to be plain-spoken, colloquial, unafraid to be Stories would take. His best songs have an authentic, unaffected quality, that of  someone talking to about some odd thing that happened them, recent or in the past, setting a scene, establishing an attitude, a personality at the beginning of the story, giving you an idea of where he was going with it all, an idea of what the moral of the tale would be, but then he concludes or at least stops his story at some point you didn't expect.He could be colloquial without being unclear, idiomatic without resorting to cracker barrel cliches; this was  someone you knew perhaps not intimately, but  who you knew well enough to have an ongoing conversation about the weather, sports, women, bad jobs, celebration and tribulation and come away with a feeling that you had just tapped into  a larger Life Force. This writer wasn't, though, a preacher, a saint, or an expert, or at least not  an expert on anything beyond his experiences and the blessings or consequences of them. He didn't \"drop knowledge\", he didn't advise, he didn't moralize. He just told you what he knew and admitted what he didn't know and leave you a strong inclination to lean closer and observe longer and perhaps glean some incidental insight as to how to remain teachable after you've learned all the answers. That was a huge part of my attraction to his music and lyrics, their complete lack of pretension. \r  \n\r  \nPrine was less a poet, capital \"P\" than were some  of his contemporaries, than he was storyteller, but with the sense of structure of a great short story writer like John Cheever or Raymond Carver. John Prine was a romantic with good sense of the hard , real ground even dreamers must walk.  He was a fatalist who could accept either a good or band hand dealt him by a world that paid his expectations no mind. But wouldn't dive into a murky, sticky self-pity, a critical flaw in many a singer/songwriter's work. Jackson Browne, for example. His music was such that it revealed a well-balanced ambivalence to circumstances and outcomes.  He kept a sense of humor, allowed the events of his life to mature into genuine wisdom. He continued to pursue his call.  Prine wasn't a happy-go-lucky naif, he wasn't cheery when matters hit the skids or if his expectations weren't met.  He acknowledged his feelings, he would pause and rise to his feet after a while and continued his path. An element of his tales, his loves, and heartaches, is this mastery of the Long-View, the unexpected but welcome shift in perspective that provides what the lesson was of experience, if there was any. Nothing preachy, nothing of the old man attempt award wisdom drawn from travels and travails. Pine sounded like he was talking to you, in a living room, over lunch, at a bar, over a backyard fence. And, as I said, he had a sense of humor. He has a song called \"When I Get to Heaven\" from his 2018 record THE TREE OF FORGIVENESS:\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWhen I get to heaven, I'm gonna shake God's hand\r  \nThank him for more blessings than one man can stand\r  \nThen I'm gonna get a guitar and start a rock-n-roll band\r  \nCheck into a swell hotel, ain't the afterlife grand?\r  \nAnd then I'm gonna get a cocktail: vodka and ginger ale\r  \nYeah, I'm gonna smoke a cigarette that's nine miles long\r  \nI'm gonna kiss that pretty girl on the tilt-a-whirl\r  \n'Cause this old man is goin' to town Then as God as my witness, I'm gettin' back into showbusiness I'm gonna open up a nightclub called \"The Tree ofForgiveness\" And forgive everybody ever done me any harm\r  \nWell, even invite a few choice critics, those syph'liticparasitics Buy 'em a pint of Smithwick's and smother 'em with my charm\r  \n'Cause then I'm gonna get a cocktail: vodka and ginger ale\r  \nYeah I'm gonna smoke a cigarette that's nine miles long\r  \nI'm gonna kiss that pretty girl on the tilt-a-whirl\r  \nYeah this old man is goin' to town\r  \nYeah when I get to heaven, I'm gonna take that wristwatchoff my armWhat are you gonna do with time after you've bought thefarm?\r  \nAnd then I'm gonna go find my mom and dad, and good oldbrother Doug\r  \nWell I bet him and cousin Jackie are still cuttin' up a rug\r  \nI wanna see all my mama's sisters, 'cause that's where allthe love startsI miss 'em all like crazy, bless their little hearts\r  \nAnd I always will remember these words my daddy said\r  \nHe said, \"Buddy, when you're dead, you're a deadpecker-head\"I hope to prove him wrong... that is, when I get to heaven\r  \n'Cause I'm gonna have a cocktail: vodka and ginger ale\r  \nYeah I'm gonna smoke a cigarette that's nine miles long\r  \nI'm gonna kiss that pretty girl on the tilt-a-whirl\r  \nYeah this old man is goin' to town\r  \nYeah this old man is goin' to town \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThis is the greatest of all American literary personas, the knowing hick, the bucolic philosopher, the country ironist, a figure that is from Mark Twain straight up to Richard Brautigan and Kurt Vonnegut, an unlettered man, apparently, with an indefatigable self-confidence and Panglossian who, aware that he is dead and in the clouds with his Creator, shakes His hand and sets out to do what a heaven of his imagining would be, to have his favorite cocktail, smoke copious amounts of cigarettes , stick it  to his nettlesome critics by compelling them to sit through his nightclub act, reunite with this family not for tears and regrets but for good times and real love... You can go through his catalog of songs and parse his lyrics any number of ways and marvel at the sweet subtleties he created with such clear, unmannered, and unfussy language. He was an Everyman who was appealing because he wasn't trying to impress anyone or blow them away with Big Stories with Big Message, messages that were hackneyed, ala Harry Chapin. Prine's ambition seemed not much more than to be the best songwriter he could be , someone surprised that a great many others over the years admired his rich body of work",

Angel From Montgomery was later a mega- hit for Bonnie Raitt and I still sing along every time I hear any version of it. Paradise, Spanish Pipedream, and Pretty Good are some notable favorites and those are just from his debut of a long and celebrated life of music and storytelling. He's a hero to a lot of writers and musicians.",

I'm extremely proud that I broke the school-night rule to take my son to see him years ago, and it seems sadly fitting that he was one of the first \"visible\" Americans to die of covid.   \n\nhe's one of those artists that have millions and millions of silent fans.  you can mention John Prine in just about any gathering of 20 or 30 people, and at least two people will turn out to know him.   and those who know him *know* him.  we can all sing sam stone and illegal smile and paradise and dear abby without even stopping to think.   \n\nI sang please don't bury me to myself when I heard he had died  \ud83d\ude0a",

When he died the song Fish &amp; Whistle really spoke to me. Soothing in tone and the lyrics... let God forgive the sins of humans, and let us in turn forgive God for all the pain of the mortal world. 'Til we both turn blue. Wouldn't that be satisfying? If there is an after to this life, I hope Prine is whistling and fishing in heaven. My dad too.\n\nI appreciated your thoughts.",

John got back up on the stage and played seven songs, and then went to the bar for a beer. When he came back, Kris made him go back up and play all seven song again. \n\nThere also a quote attributed to Kristofferson, that he told someone that Prine was \"so good we're going to have to break his fingers.\"\n\nIf Kris Kristofferson is praising your songs, you're off to a pretty good start.\n\nMy wife and I cried for days when Prine passed. There's nobody else like him.",

You could say Bob Dylan was a better lyricist, but he wasn\u2019t as funny as John. Dylan, Prine, and Robert Hunter all brought forth a unique American voice in their works. Sam Stone is the best Vietnam war song as it pulls no punches and the lyrics and melody are equally as somber.",

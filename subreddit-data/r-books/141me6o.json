    "postText": "Just finished this. It was practically impossible to find people online who have had discussions on this anywhere. So I went in blind, except a lot of comments of goodreads saying some stuff about inverted detective story and especially \u201cperfect murder\u201d.\n\nThe hero of the story is very interesting down to the last page. The author\u2019s talent at writing shows and does not cease to surprise you. If you read it for the sake of a well done character study and artistic writing, you have got the right book. But, \u201cperfect murder\u201d, it is not. It\u2019s actually stupid how the hero doesn\u2019t realise things for what they are, until it\u2019s too late. He tries very hard for getting the wrong details right. But in the end, it\u2019s the way a book is written that makes all the difference. And its ending, although very surprising, felt just right that &gt;!he was hanged for something that might not even have been his own doing, something he never even saw coming his way.!&lt;\n\nI so much wanna see how others see the last few pages of the story. Because for me, it surely has got to be one of the best written endings of any crime thriller.",

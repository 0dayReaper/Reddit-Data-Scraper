    "postText": "I just read Kurt Vonnegut's masterpiece and now I'm just kind of sitting here, staring off into space. Thinking about humanity's complete and utter destruction at our own hands. \n\nIts not just the apocolyptic ending that makes the book so depressing, because while that's the ultimate sort of punch line to the book, we're long convinced by that point that humanity is fucked. \n\nWe have on one side scientists blindly seeking truth regardless of what comes of that newfound understanding, or what evil intentions those funding this research into the unknown might have. On the other hand we have religion which is meaning and understanding built upon lies from charlatans trying to control us through \"harmless untruths\" or Plato's famous \"Noble Lies\" which gives meaning to the meaningless in the form of order supposedly ordained by God. \n\nThese two facets of our society lead us to seek gratification, adulation, and stimulation above our own welfare, making us fanatical towards ideas that are blatantly wrong, stupid, or just outright lies because it makes us feel good, and gives us meaning. Ultimately this can only lead to our destruction, because the society we've made is fundamentally rotten. Even when we get what we want we still don't accept it because that truth and understanding we were so fanatical about is ultimately meaningless, and this just drives us crazy. \n\nI don't know if I'm exactly right or wrong but that's how I saw it. Overall its definitely one of the less funny Vonnegut books, not that there isn't humor, or that the jokes are bad, its just that the bleakness of the situation outweighs the humor which isn't as crazy as say Dr. Strangelove to really break through the darkness that hangs over the novel. You just are left with a scientist's curiosity ending the world, and a religious leader still trying to write his holy texts and give all this death meaning, even though nobody is left to give that meaning too.\n\nI feel like this is one of Vonnegut's more bitter works, like he took a look at the two core institutions in our society, religion and science, technology, meaning, and the ultimate search for truth, and just washed his hands of all of it, which is very interesting considering how pro science he was in his life. I just got the feeling of anger throughout the book, a hopeless melancholy of satarizing the worst traits of humanity and displaying it to all of us in a very compact, bold, and dense format. \n\nI'd give this book a 5/5 imo, its just as good as SH5, and carries a lot of the despair for humanity that you find in most of Vonnegut's work. As sharp and witty as the man was, I think his empathy was his greatest tool, and it really is on display in Cat's Cradle, varying at times between reproachful and hauntingly foreboding. Its message resonates throughout humanity and is and will forever be relevant. Don't skip it!",

The book has sad parts but the end is not sad, it more makes sense and ties everything together but makes you feel empty. I'm not sure what word would describe it\n\nThe book is fantastic though, really his best work",

For one it's very funny, but for another the whole point of the Bokonism angle is saying that we can find happiness even despite all of the awful truths out there. We just need to worry more about what is empathetic and less about what is objectively/scientifically correct. The ending comes about from the obsession with technological progress at the expense of human progress, and Bokonism posits that it is possible to focus on human progress, instead.",

If we could see the consequences of our actions would we still act the same? Our set patterns and mechanisms hurt not just ourselves but others around us. This book was written from a place of love, deep and abiding love, not anger or bitterness. It\u2019s a love song to the closed loop system that ties us all together, a map to the pattern and puzzle. I\u2019ve read it probably 50 times, I\u2019ve even read it to my kids, so I encourage you to read it several more times and see what changes for you on subsequent readings. Humans are flawed and intrinsically connected and there are endless possibilities because in the end there is always humanity.",

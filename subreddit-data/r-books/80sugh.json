My favorite thing is that most of the books have a flap in the back of the book with talking points you can use before, during and after reading the book with your child.  \n\nWe don't receive books from her foundation, but I do buy used copies of the books from eBay.",

In terms of quality, it lies between Six Flags, and DisneyWorlds Magic Kingdom. Leaning towards The Magic Kingdom. It's staff is mostly elderly because it's hard finding a job as you get older and they help with that (atleast, that's what I've heard). It has some of the best rollercoasters imaginable, and it's overall a wholesome experience. Plus, the park really pushes the local economy the town lives off of. ",

I bet I watched it 30 times and even made my dad video tape it so I could watch it at home. ",

Nobody talked to each other unless they had to. When my wife and I got here, we were broke, unemployed, and her car battery died within 2 weeks of arrival which left us short one car to go job hunting in. Anyways, when it went out, she limped it to the nearest parts store to find out how much it was going to cost... 100 bucks. We didn't have it, so I figured I'd just go pick her up and have her car towed home and we'd just have to carpool. Nope. By the time I got there 10-15 minutes later, the guy in line behind her at the store had paid for her new battery without saying anything. I tried to get him to give me his phone number or an address where I could send the money. He wasn't having it. My wife cried. I have never been in a place that is more generous and happy to help than Tennessee, and I am humbled by it. This is a place that inspires me to pay it forward every chance I get. I love Tennessee.",

The people were really friendly and I bought a child\u2019s guitar (I was young) and there was a guitar playing street performer dude taught me how to place my fingers on the guitar and taught me how to play a note. I still remember to this day. \n\nBut it was really great. I really want to go back and visit the music museums and go with my grandpa to Memphis to fangirl/boy over Elvis haha",

This was not spiritual, nor was it sexual. It was healing or comforting. Gene listened, and said, \"Roger, I felt the exact same thing during my interview with her.\" We looked at each other. What did this mean? Neither one of us ever felt that feeling again. From time to time we would refer to it in wonder.\"",

There are lots of volunteers who make this possible, many of them putting in their own money, and of course the organization accepts donations. ",

Many of the certificates never got redeemed. The school then began busing the students to the bookstore as a field trip to assure students got their book. Then the school opened a 'free bookstore' in a spare classroom, filling it with books purchased at thrift stores and garage sales and the bookstore exprience was expanded to every student, every month.",

Dolly's nonprofit is a sort of middleman, ordering books using money that local nonprofits in your community pay for through their own fundraising. Through a program like Scholastic, you can skip that step and choose/buy books directly.\n\nIf someone knows that the books Dolly's program gets are different/better, then that would be a difference and a reason to use the middleman. In addition to parent-teacher organizations, many civic organizations have outreach efforts to youth causes... Rotary, Lions, Kiwanis, etc. Kiwanis is specifically focused on helping kids.",

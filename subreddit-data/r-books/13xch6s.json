It\u2019s a vampire type book, where a girl is thirst from her normal world into the vampire world she thought to be fiction, and is experimented upon due to not being able to be compelled. I wrote it after finishing the Vampire Diaries and Vampire Academy book series, and just felt a hole in my heart. I\u2019m sure people can relate \ud83d\ude02",

            "comment": "Just finished reading, and am still processing, Timothy Egan\u2018s new book about the KKK in the Midwest 100 years ago. Title: A Fever in the Heartland. Pub date in April.\nWhile there are obvious parallels with recent political events in the US, I think that could be a distraction from the more general application of the story. You wonder, sometimes, how it is that humans are capable of following some of the worst representatives of our species, and doing so with stubborn persistence, no matter how badly that person behaves. \nThe main character in this book was truly monstrous, yet he and the ideology he espoused had hundreds of thousands of followers. In Indiana, for example, which had lost 25,000 Union soldiers in the Civil War just 60 years before, hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers joined the KKK. Some of these KKK members were the children and grandchildren of those who died fighting slavery.\n\nEgan has written about racism before. He was part of a team with the New York Times that won a Pulitzer for a series of reports on racism. He is a very engaging writer, and has reams of research behind his books. This one reminds me a bit of Helter Skelter, the book on Charles Manson and his crimes, by Vincent Bugliosi. \n\nAnyone who says \u201cit can\u2019t happen here\u201d hasn\u2019t read a shred of history. \n\nThe good news is, there are some real heroes in this book, whose work finally ends up taking the bad guy down, and putting him in jail. The irony is, it\u2019s the jailed leader of the KKK who finally brings it down. He was angry that the followers he put in positions of power lacked the loyalty and commitment to spring him from jail.\n\nSobering read. Highly recommended.",

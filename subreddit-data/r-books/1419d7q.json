            "comment": "Finished:\n\n**The Steppenwolf, by Hermann Hesse (transl. Kurt Beals)** \n\nYes, *The* Steppenwolf - Beals argues for this in his introduction. I like his approach to this translation, and the result is excellent. Steppenwolf itself is great, of course - perhaps less revelatory than if I had been born 70 years earlier and read it shortly after its release, but still. Much is made of how to read Steppenwolf and whether parts are supposed to be taken literally, as metaphor, or both - it's \"easier\" in that respect than Journey to the East, though, &gt;!particularly if you're already used to the idea of psychological archetypes, the now-common trope of various parts of the subconscious manifesting themselves as different personae, etc.!&lt;\n\n**The Norse Myths, by Caroline Larrington**\n\nAn overview of Norse myth rather than a (for example) Gaiman-style retelling, Larrington's book is lucid, informative, and quite funny at times, despite its academic approach. I like that she traces different versions of the myths, where relevant, instead of taking one version the way that narrative retellings (once again, like Gaiman's) do.\n\nStarted:\n\n**Provenance, by Ann Leckie**",

Owen King (of whom I didn't realize who he was until googling him) is absolutely not his father in terms of talent.\n\nMoving on to **Salman Rushdie's Victory City**.  Hopefully it'll be better.",

Many comparisons to draw to modern day issues. All in all a good read. An insightful leftist glance at modern economics for anyone to read.\n\nStarted: The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck\n\n-never read this and absolutely should have. Im not even a fifth in, and am already loving it. I remember not being the biggest fan of the only Steinbeck novel I\u2019ve read so far, which was In Dubious Battle. The writing is so much different and much improved from that book in this. If you haven\u2019t read this, it\u2019s place as an American epic is absolutely deserved, and it\u2019s narrative is necessary in understanding a key part in American history.",

Extremely conceptual and not always easy because of the vignette style of the cityscapes. Definitely worth reading even for the language alone.\n\nStarted: Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates, by Tom Robbins\n\nThoughts: I just finished reading Jitterbug Perfume by Robbins earlier in the year with my husband. Robbins is as funny and captivating as Vonnegut IMO. His books are incredibly fun. I\u2019m enjoying this one very much so far. A character drops XTC and his eyes are described as being as dialated as the burners on a dollhouse stove. Just a great talent for language.",

Though it is short it completely focuses on character building and background of our main protagonist while also moving forward plot. I thought this was more fantasy series than horror when I started, but I was wrong. He still has his eerie writing style in it that could make a fun scene freakishly chilling. The reason I am not going to the second one just yet is because I started this on my kindle and decided that I wanted to read it on paperback so I am waiting for the whole collection to come in from Amazon. I recommend it for any fantasy series fans out there. Just maybe read it with the lights on... lol\n\nStarts: The Midnight Library by Matt Haig",

As a guy, and hearing some people talk about the romance portion of the book, I thought that it would be like a Charolette Bront\u00eb book. And I\u2019m not hating on romance novels, I just hate it combined with all prose that Bront\u00eb uses. I can deal with all the prose, hell, I loved A Picture of Dorian Gray. So when I started reading it, and then these characters started jumping to conclusions and showing their pride, it made me want to tell the characters \u201cyea, perhaps you need to take a step back!.\u201d That was the moment that I was like \u201choly shit, Jane Austen, you are on to something here.\u201d \n\nIt is a criticism of the time with parents wanting their daughters to marry out of money/status, while showing how dumb it was back then to see someone a few times before getting hitched, parents who don\u2019t care and aren\u2019t focused on their children, etc, but to me is was more an exploration of behavioral psychology and on logic.\n\nI mean, I can keep going on and on about this book. \n\nI will say, that I love tragedies. Many people hate it when the hero or lovable character dies or when an ending is ambiguous, which they will say that it was a bad ending, but I love them. Yet, this was the first book where I was heavily rooting for Elizabeth and Darcy to end up together(and Jane and Bingley too). I would have been massively crushed if they didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I can say the same for other books.",

I like how much some of his stuff ties together behind the scenes, and some of it doesn't hide the connections at all. There were some bits in here that make me question King's mind, but also, he has always been inventive and tends towards some truly WTF kind of stuff so, not that surprising. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Starting Soon:*\n\nI'm not entirely sure, I do know I'm going to read something light as a palette cleanser, and I'm taking a one or two book break from my road trip(I've finished everything East of the Mississippi, so I think I deserve a teensy break from it); so something where those two objectives align.",

Hoping to read the next one this week or next based on library holds.\n\nFinished: **The Spy, by Paulo Coelho** \\- This was for my book club's monthly theme (any book by Paulo Coelho). I know very little about Mata Hari, the real person who apparently did some crazy stuff during her life, and I thought the way this told the story (from her perspective, in letter(ish) format), was interesting and compelling. I didn't get a full message from it, but I enjoyed the read and the writing style.\n\nFinished: **Gideon the Ninth, by Tamsyn Muir** (The Locked Tomb #1, audiobook) - This is the 2nd time I've read this book; I wanted to listen to the audio and OH BOY was it amazing! 17 hours of listening is a huge commitment, but I am so happy I took the time.\n\nStarted: **The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne** \\- You guys, I'm gonna be honest, I don't know if I can read this again. It's for my book club's July theme, which is a reread of a book you hated (likely in school) but seriously? I'm staring at a 45 page Introduction apparently written by the author for his own work and I think I dozed off twice so far. I'm going to power through, but when I get bored I've got a couple others next up in the queue:\n\n**Spy x Family, Vol. 6, by Tatsuya Endo**\n\n**Flux, by Jinwoo Chong**",

I read Song of Achilles after and definitely felt it wasn't as good. I do wonder if it's because we all know the story of Achilles, and we have our Hollywood heroes who've played the roles, but with Circe this story is fully told, with snippets of stories it crosses.",

I only realized at the end that all the girls in this book were the same age as my oldest child.  It was very well-written, but she has an obvious agenda and made a couple of statements I see as pretty dubious (chiefly, that 11- and 12-year-olds don't understand that death is permanent), and also pretty much relegated the victim to footnote status after the crime.  She was only mentioned a handful of times, while her would-be murderers got the bulk of the text.  Which, on the one hand I sort of get that that's where most of the story was since the author was making a case against trying such young adolescents as adults, but on the other it felt disrespectful to the one person in the book who did nothing wrong.\n\nStarted:\n\n**The Hidden, by Melanie Golding**: Fairly interesting, but not earth-shaking.  For some reason this is classed as a thriller, even though it's very slow-moving and has some elements of fantasy.  There's some tense-jumping I'm not very fond of, but it's holding my interest.",

    "postText": "4/5 stars\n\nThis book is the first of what would become a trilogy from the same author about the Chinese continuous struggle from the overthrow of empire in 1911 to the communist victory in 1949. As the dates on the cover suggest, the timeline covered is far too much for such a tiny book, so it will mostly deal with chronology and uniform details. By the time you reach the end, you already forgot the beginning.\r  \n\r  \nThe text is adequate but focus mostly on the Nationalist faction. Given they bore the brunt of the fight from 1928 to 1945, that makes sense but there is a lot of duplication regarding uniforms and 3 (three!) tables of ranks for the Republican Army (followed by the warlords), the Nationalist Army, the Manchukuo Army with lengthy descriptions of colours that could - and should - have been done far more easily in the plates. The soldiers are mainly poor guys forced into one army or another and, as part of the dance of politics, are forced into the armies of the victors (if they are not shot, that is).\r  \n\r  \nThe main quality of this book is to give a visual guide and structure of the period, and that I can say it does very well. From the Westernized Imperial Army to the motley Warlord armies, to the more recognizable pro- and anti-Japanese armies of the end of the story. The weapons came from all around the world but there were always more men than guns (artillery was a luxury), so you see lance-armed soldiers in the 1940's. Child soldiers, bandits, beggars, warlord officers that are no more than mafiosos, White Russians, professional soldiers... We have it all. The Warlords dressed like peackocks and \"would design their own awards and hand them out to their officers and friendly fellow Warlords like trinkets\" and ruled like brutal feudal lords.\r  \n\r  \nThe creation of the Nationalist Army creates a rethink: the Warlords would never relinquish power and this lead to the idea of an army to enforce the rule of law over all of China. The Nationalists defeated the Warlords in 1928, by being institutionally stronger and becoming the dominant power in China; but would get encroached by the Japanese already in 1931. The Nationalists would be hailed as national heroes for their heroic stand against Japanese bullying in Shanghai in 1932. The author says in a caption they beat-off the Japanese, which they certainly didn't, but their resistance was embarassing for the Japanese. They still lost, but the seed of nationalism was planted.\r  \n\r  \nA very welcome surprise was the introduction of the \"puppet\" armies, with Manchukuo and the other pro-Japanese forces, but beyond uniform and equipment there is very little. The plate of puppet Emperor Pu Yi was a great choice. The organisation was also a good addition. The author then short-sells the Nationalists for the rest of the book and presents the Communists in a way too positive light, omiting the armoured Nationalist forces equipped by the Americans and how those same Americans pushed them in front of the Japanese onslaught in Operation Ichi-Go. There is also nothing about the Nationalist parachute forces created in 1944 - again, space. But the overall product is positive, even if it is just a primer.\r  \n\r  \nThe author published the second book covering the 1937-45 timeline, but by shoving the Civil War into it the book was squandered with uniform fluff and repetition. The third book is about the Warlord armies from 1911-1930, that gives a more manageable subject-to-space ratio, which can be augmented by a larger 260-page book \"The Armies of Warlord China 1911-1928\" that is also a good reference; Philip Jowett also wrote \"China's Wars: Rousing the Dragon 1894-1949\" with a larger 400 pages.",

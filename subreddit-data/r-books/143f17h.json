    "postText": "I've got about 25 pages left of this book and I am incredibly conflicted. I am interested in how others who've read it feel about it. Being honest, I'm hoping someone can point out some reason I shouldn't feel like I've wasted so much time with it. I hate getting to the end of a book and wishing I had that time back--especially when it's over 700 pages of time. Disappointment is not a common feeling I get at the end of a book.\n\nHere are my thoughts about regretting the book: Mostly, I'm feeling like this could have accomplished the same thing in 300 pages. I was hoping for (and expecting) a book delving into the philosophical, ethical and moral fallout of both sides of the story when someone commits an act of violence against another. I know that there are ripples that impact a family and community, and I wanted to read how someone brought those up and where they took it. Instead, I feel like this scratched at it but never developed it. I have other problems with the book, but that was the main disappointment.\n\nThoughts from other readers? And did the parenthetical comments distract you? I've been trying to find ways to read them for the entire book. Read those comments first? After reading the sentence without them? Try to read them as they pop up without forgetting what was written first? I'm happy to be almost done so I can move on to something else, and that is a book feeling I rarely have. ",

            "comment": "I read the book when it  first came out, which was many years ago.  I do know I did enjoy it and found it a great read.  I don't recall specific details.  I feel the book showed what extremism can lead a person to do.  It showed how these  extremes destroys not just the person killed.  It also the destroys the family of the person that was killed and the family of the person doing the killing.  \n\nJoyce Carol Oates is a HUGE fan of pro boxing.  That is why she went into such detail about boxing.  She knows her stuff about the training etc...\n\nJoyce is not a philosophical writer, I feel she wanted the reader to make up their minds as to what they felt about either side.  She wasn't going to \"preach\" both sides of the fence.",

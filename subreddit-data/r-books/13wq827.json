    "postText": "So I work at a library in the circulation department and I saw this book while I was emptying the book drop one day. I have never seen the movie but heard really good things about it. I decided to read it and it is without a doubt one of the best children\u2019s novels I have ever read. I was very impressed with the depth of how the author explored the ethics of experimenting on animals and how different civilizations struggle to survive. If the book is this good, I\u2019m looking forward to watching the movie! Anyone else ever read it?",

It made a really strong impression on me because of how it treats loss and decline - it was one of the first books I read, or at least one of the most memorable, that didn't have happy endings for everybody. &gt;!The owl who knows his tree will fall one day but is too old to leave it. The rats who mostly survive in the end but have to abandon everything they've built.!&lt; It doesn't pluck at your heartstrings, it just lays out in simple language what is happening and what it means to the characters - inviting you to sit with their losses, present or future, and simply experience them as the characters do.",

I've often stated that Mrs Frisbee is probably the most human character I've encountered in fiction--how she makes logical deductions which are sometimes right and sometimes wrong, how she makes moral decisions, and is determined. Especially, because when she is saved by a dues ex machina moment, she hasn't given up; she didn't freeze in terror, but kept fighting, knowing she was getting weaker and her struggle was futile.\n\nI've never heard anyone speak about the smaller moments in the book like you did, but I love it, and you're right. For a children's book, the characters are adult, the concepts are adult. It's a brilliant work of fiction\n\nEdit: i checked. It lives in the esteemed very favorites section of my bookshelf, not the 2nd favorites section",

There's a number of things that would read as racist, ableist, sexist, etc to any modern reader, but they were actually considered correct at the time the book was written. So it's one of those that adults need to read with a critical lens, and children should discuss with an adult(also might need explanations for some technology and old-fashioned terms).",

The movie definitely deviates from the book, especially towards the end, but I wouldn't say one is necessarily better or worse, just two different approaches to the same story. One is more Sci-fi, one is more fantasy so while you might prefer one over the other, on their own they are both excellent. \n\nIf you have any love for hand drawn animation the movie is an absolute joy. Don Bluth is really the only animator outside of Disney to do Disney quality animation in the US.",

Who's to say at the end of the day whether that decision was driven more by story or marketing. I can understand either to varying extents but will also understand fans of the book not liking it, and back to my original comment, there's a certain point where once you change a story so much for an adaptation it could just be its own idea",

I love that it pulls no punches with the ending, but leaves the reader feeling a bit sad and wistful. \n\nThe movie is also one of my favorite movies, *but* it is very, very different from the book. The book is fairly realistic sci-fi with a slight fantasy flavor (talking animals), whereas the movie adds a whole magical/mystical element that I think is unnecessary. However, the animation is beautiful (I particularly love Mr. Ages' home/ workshop), and the voice acting is excellent. Even the soundtrack is good. You just have to go into it not expecting it to be faithful to the book.",

It also was notable at the time because it portrayed a female protagonist (a mother in addition).  \n\nThe movie has beautiful animation and music, but it doesn't follow the book precisely.  I still appreciate the Don Bluth animation work and how well they animate animals.",

I had read ahead even though we were encouraged not to. I was sent to sit in the hall and told to sit down and shut my mouth. \n\nI deserved it but I didn\u2019t talk the rest of the school year. Not a peep. Teacher had to call my mother about it and everything.\n\nAnyway, loved the book! It was fantastic. No spoilers here.",

It's still fun though.",

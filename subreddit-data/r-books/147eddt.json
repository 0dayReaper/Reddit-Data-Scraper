    "postText": "After much discussion and careful consideration we moderators of [r/books](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/) have decided to join in solidarity with Redditors and moderators, who feel recent changes to third party support will negatively or irrevocably impact their ability to effectively use Reddit. By shuttering our subreddit for 48 hours we wish to show support to those individuals without whom Reddit would not be the place it is today.\n\nWe had hoped that after concerns were brought to the attention of Reddit administrators a constructive dialogue could take place. Nothing we have seen since the announcement has made us feel that the concerns were heard or that they will be addressed.\n\nThis choice was not made lightly. We hope that those most affected by this shutdown will understand.\n\n[r/books](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/) will be suspending normal activity and the mod team will be changing the subreddit to restricted for 48 hours, starting 12:01am ET June 12 and ending 11:59pm ET June 13. During this time period no new posts or comments will be able to be made.",

    "postText": "I'm learning German so I have just read an adapted version in German. At first I thought the main character, Else, was super annoying and immature and that the whole situation is ridiculous. I also didn't like how 5 chapters in a row she basically kept discussing with herself the same thing over and over.\n\nBut that's just me not being the brightest. I truly sympathized with her closer to the end, when I finally got the true meaning behind the plot. Her internal dialogue is not a flaw, but a whole *point* of the story, and it actually left me sad and excited and wanting to think about it. I would even reread the original version some day.\n\nAll in all, I really liked it. The last story that resembled this one was Nastya by Vladimir Sorokin, a story about a 16 year old from privileged family. The plot will make you horrified for sure. But both stories are kiiiinda similar and both make you read between the lines and think about it further on.",

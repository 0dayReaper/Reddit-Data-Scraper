Maybe it is reading a series out of order, or telling them to read it from \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_-perspective, or to skip certain sections of the book.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy best example: I adore the Six of Crows duology, but every time I recommend it I always say \"skim or skip Chapter 1. Chapter 2 can be confusing, so the only characters you need to remember are Kaz, Inej, and Jesper; feel free to forget the rest. The story is going to focus in a lot more in Chapter 3 but the book doesn't hit it's stride until around Chapter 7.\" I love the series, but I feel like the first book has a slow/confusing start that I like to warn friends about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat books do you often give instructions for?",

That being said, I have gotten over half a dozen friends, family members, students, etc to pick up the series and the feedback I always get from them is \"wait, what was going on in the first chapter?\" and \"there are so many people introduced in chapter 2 who were not at all related to chapter 1, it confused me.\"",

I feel like it\u2019s one of those books that just really comes to life when you understand where Jackson was at when she wrote it. I also just recommend checking out one of her memoirs before or after reading to get a handle on her humor and dry wit. Neither is probably going to change how you feel about it if you didn\u2019t like it, but I think it makes a world of difference for 3 star raters who just feel like they didn\u2019t really get it.",

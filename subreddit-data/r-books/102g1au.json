It\u2019s what Steam pays your average creator for a game sale, it\u2019s what Amazon pays on ebooks, it\u2019s what Apple pays for apps downloaded. (And they\u2019re getting heat for taking as much as they are. Rightly so.)\u201d Sanderson explained. \u201cAudible pays 40%. Almost half. For a frame of reference, most brick-and-mortar stores take around 50% on a retail product. Audible pays indie authors less than a bookstore does, when a bookstore has storefronts, sales staff, and warehousing to deal with.\u201d",

The only series I still support off Audible is the \u201cCradle\u201d series by Will Wight, and that\u2019s mainly because I simply cannot *not* finish the story, I\u2019m too emotionally invested at this point. After this series is through, I will never buy another product through Amazon, period.\n\nExclusive rights should be against the law. I should absolutely be able to find good indie authors on Audible, and then have the option to purchase their books or audiobooks off the authors own page. I **want** to support indie authors, I read 3-4 books a month, but I refuse to feed the dragon that is Amazon.\n\nIndie authors, if you\u2019re reading this, setup a Patreon or something. I\u2019ll hoist the black-flag, and kick you a share of the spoils I plunder from the nethers of the ether! You do all the work, yet Amazon takes the lions share. Fuck that.",

A few of the ways libraries get raked over the coals when it comes to ebooks are:\n\n* Having to pay WAY more than a regular user to buy an ebook\n* Having to purchase multiple \"copies\" of an ebook to be able to check it out to more than one person at a time\n* Only being allowed to check it out a certain number of times (I'm not sure of the exact number) before having to re-purchase\n* At least one publisher has tried to embargo libraries from buying their ebooks for several months after release, hoping that impatient readers will give up waiting and buy a copy themselves\n\nAll of which is to say, I can fully believe that some publishers at least might try to stop libraries from buying audiobooks at all, if the market became more competitive.",

When I check out a book on my Libby app, whether it's an e book or an audiobook, it's only for three weeks, same as our physical copy restrictions. Only difference is the app will automatically return the book on its due date unless I renew it ahead of time, which you can't do if there's a wait-list. It's a fantastic system and I wish publishing companies weren't so shitty.",

The Shards do not qualify for this and neither does Adonalsium. Similarly, he will never state whether their is a true afterlife in the Christian sense. This is precisely because it would invalidate the beliefs of someone like Jasnah. [Here](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/332/#e9596) is an example of one of the places he talks about this issue (quoted below as well).\n\n&gt;Questioner:\nAfter people die, in this universe, where exactly do they go? Because, at first they appear in this one world, and then they go somewhere else.\n\n&gt;Brandon Sanderson:\nSo where do people go when they die. *laughter* In the cosmere. One of the things that's very important to me as a writer, when I am writing stories, is when we get to these kind of fundamental questions about faith and religion and things like this, that the narrative is allowing multiple characters' viewpoints to be plausibly true, if this makes sense. For instance, I am not gonna come out and say, \"Is there a capital-G God of the cosmere, is there an afterlife?\" These are not questions I'm gonna answer, because in-world, they can't answer them. What they can say is, your Investiture will leave what we call a Cognitive Shadow, which is an imprint of your personality that can do certain things. And that most of those fade away, and you can see them, glimpse them, and then watch them go. But, are they going somewhere? Or are they not? Is that simply the Investiture being reclaimed, Is it more of a Buddhist thought, where your soul is getting recycled and used again? Is it nothing, you return to, you know, being-- yeah, is it a different type of matter? Or is there a Beyond, is there a capital-G God? Things like this. These questions are not answered. I'm never gonna answer those.\nNow, the characters will try to answer them. But it's important to me that both Dalinar and Jasnah can exist in the same universe, and that the story is not saying \"This one is right, and this one is wrong.\" The story is saying \"This is how this one sees the world; this is how this one sees the world.\" It's very important to me from the beginning to do that, just because-- Like, I hate reading a book where someone espouses my viewpoint only to get proven wrong by the entire structure of the narrative, and in that universe, that person is wrong. But I'm like, \"In our universe, I don't think that I am. Just the way you constructed everything makes it so that I have to be wrong, if I were living in your universe, even if it's a universe that's not a sci-fi/fantasy one.\" If that makes sense.\nThis is just kind of for respecting my characters and for the people who hold the viewpoints of my characters, in particular if they happen to be different from my own viewpoints. I feel there are certain lines I'm not gonna cross.\nSo, the answer is: who do you believe? Which of the philosophies in the books do you look at and say \"Yeah!\" Or, even better: listen to lots of different ones, and maybe these different viewpoints are all gonna have interesting points that'll give you things to think upon.",

We, of course, see plenty of people interact with Shards and Splinters and whatnot, but most people in the Cosmere won\u2019t truly know there\u2019s a form of deity and an afterlife until they, well, are heading for it. \n\nThe god Jasnah didn\u2019t believe in was the Almighty. Now, of course, we know the Vorin church modeled the Almighty after Honor, but if you actually listen to the teachings of Vorinism, it\u2019s full of just as much made up bullshit as our current day religions\u2019. Her logic for her atheism is just as sound as real life atheists. \n\nOn top of that, she begs a question I don\u2019t see many people asking, even now: Just because a being with supreme power exists, does that make that being good/worthy of worship? You needn\u2019t look past Odium to get that answer (in this fictional universe). Hell, Honor was \u201cgood\u201d and incredibly flawed - so flawed he got himself, a (vessel to a) shard of infinity, killed.\n\nEdit: Oh! Magic!

Then i watched and read reviews of it (which I always like doing *after* finishing a book) and was astonished to see that *everyone* was under the impression that it was about a guy with depression.

His universe operates on its own rules that are inspired by real life cultures and religions, but are not subordinate to them. Plus he seems like he is super interested in mental illnesses and human weakness, so his characters are often deeply damaged, sick, or flawed, but he writes them with a lot of empathy. \n\nIn the Stormlight Archives every single character is suffering from some severe mental illness, trauma or other source of pain, and their growth is never about \"just getting better\" but about understanding and forgiving themselves.

The guy raised over $40m for 4 books that had zero marketing. His company Dragonsteel Productions has been making a weekly podcast for years (Writing Excuses) - he works with a professional voice actor (MRK). I mean in a way he should take them on.\n\nI'm not a fan of his work, and I am leery of his relationship with the LDS, but what Sanderson is doing here is a genuinely good thing, a brave thing.\n\nBut here's the rub - Amazon has had waaaay too much power for waaaay too long.

Patrick Rothfuss could walk right past me on most days and I've *met the guy,* unless I recognized his voice he's just another guy.\n\nAuthors just don't have public visual recognition in the same way actors do.

It's ok so far in that they offer 1 credit/month for $15, but you have to go to their website to select a book rather than through the nook app you use to listen to the book. If you read more than 1 book/month it's a bit more expensive as well because you can't buy more credits the way you can in audible. \n\nI'm trying out Spotify next as a backer of the Sanderson Kickstarter. If I like it I plan to give Spotify a chance for a couple months as well.",

Looks like author still gets a bad share of revenue same as with Audible. And in the examples they give it depends on how many people borrow the book, but using the average of 8 borrows quoted then Authors are better off financially when someone buys through Audible then borrows through Libby or Overdrive. \n\nOne thing I learned reading this article is Libby and Overdrive really aren't library books as we think of them. The books in these systems are paid licenses that expire and never become part of a collection. So really library purchasing departments are facing the same squeeze everyone else is where everything is becoming subscription based.",

At the same time, if the average borrows of eight is anywhere near the actual average, then physical copies definitely hold up for way, way more borrows.

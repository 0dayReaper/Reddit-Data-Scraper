It burned its way through a foot of concrete floor and chewed up another meter of sand and gravel beneath, completing a day that I\u2019m sure no one involved ever forgot. That process, I should add, would necessarily have been accompanied by copious amounts of horribly toxic and corrosive by-products: it\u2019s bad enough when your reagent ignites wet sand, but the clouds of hot hydrofluoric acid are your special door prize if you\u2019re foolhardy enough to hang around and watch the fireworks.\nI\u2019ll let the late John Clark describe the stuff, since he had first-hand experience in attempts to use it as rocket fuel. From his out-of-print classic Ignition! we have:\n\u201dIt is, of course, extremely toxic, but that\u2019s the least of the problem. It is hypergolic with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water-with which it reacts explosively. It can be kept in some of the ordinary structural metals-steel, copper, aluminium, etc.-because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride which protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminium keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire. For dealing with this situation, I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes.\u201d\n\nhttps://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2008/02/26/sand_wont_save_you_this_time",

It didn\u2019t have any insights about natural selection that aren\u2019t already taught in high school today with plenty of nuances that Darwin didn\u2019t know about. However, it does give a good idea of how much people knew about ecology/ biology in the 1800s. It turns out, a lot more than I expected. In addition, the popular narrative that Darwin came up with his theory after seeing finches in the Galapagos completely disregards the vast amount of academic research he did before developing his theory. In fact, if the finches came up at all in that book, it was barely a footnote.",

Levenstein production method is the one that the current generation of terrorists use to make their mustard compared to the way the US Army created Mustard in the intra-war from 1920-1945 period. \n\nLevenstein Mustard was based off the original Patent from Dow Chemical. \n\nThe Army's way was considered a classified secret because it used up less resources that Levenstein method, and could be manufactured quicker. It was a literal national secret since us being able to make more quicker might be the tiebreaker in event of a stalemate in the next war.\n\nDow's patent was released to the public in the 30s after it lapsed like every other patent that isn't actively managed. The US Military's method never became unclassified because it could still be considered a threat against us and we don't feel the need to advertise a way to mess us up. \n\nJust something to think about.",

If someone tried to use him now it would probably play out that Disney takes you to court and the expensive legal fees shut you down, BUT, you would probably win  if you could afford to make it to the end either financially or just out of spite.\nAgain, if this is true.\n\nHe's my favorite character and this just makes him even more of an interesting and storied past.",

Also a wide popular movement that they can tie it into.\"\n\nThe internet flexed its muscles with SOPA and the TPP.

You might have the rights to print a book in hardcover in Europe but you didn't have the right to other form factors, nor other markets.\n\nWhen digital came around it caused mass confusion. Some contracts specified \"all rights\" while others didn't, which left many publishers thinking they had the rights to digital versions when they really didn't. \n\nIn many cases, publishers have intentionally tried to obfuscate the public domain status of their works by sticking in a modern Forward to the book. So let's say the book was published in '63 and not renewed. The forward was written in '85 and the book's copyright will claim 1985. But the only part actually still copyrighted is just the intro by itself!",

Ideas about what is important to teach change over time, and so does the level of technology allowed/required in the classroom. Between constantly varying expectations of what students should get out of a calculus class, and constant struggling to engage students who don't learn for whatever reason, books keep changing to keep up with the demands of the day. This is not even considering the profit motive.\n\nOf course I'm just talking about calculus here, but any \"timeless\" subject fits in the same framework.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a pretty young person with a pretty bad depression. I\u2019ve always loved reading, but recently I haven\u2019t been able to do so much, even the less than challenging works or short stories. I suspect it can partially be because of strong meds jn high doses I\u2019m taking (already scheduled a doctor\u2019s appointment abt that but I don\u2019t really expect much). I\u2019ve lost most of my ability to concentrate and motivate myself, pleasant things included. Even when I do force myself to grab a book or listen to it, it feels\u2026chore-ish now, despite literature being a lifelong passion of mine. \n\nI know I can\u2019t be the only one, and I\u2019m really not happy about the fact I can\u2019t read much. So does anyone have tips for kind of easing yourself into reading while struggling with mental issues that affect your motivation, energy, focus and stuff? Also I know I don\u2019t have to read haha, I just want to (and do actually have to sometimes)",

            "comment": "We recently experienced a loss in the family and it completely changed me. Since I now don't have the same bandwidth I used to, I can ONLY read fluffy, fun, magical/fantastical, smutty romantic stuff that has a guaranteed happy ending. I am really into fanfic. I check comments and reviews before reading to ensure this. \n\nMy overly detailed advice: \n\nLook through your bookshelf and pack up or donate anything that you look at and think \"I SHOULD read that...\" because those books are not for you in this season of your life. Now your collection is less intimidating and guilt inducing. \n\nIf you had a 2023 reading goal on Goodreads, abandon it. You are working on handling depression; the last thing you need is to add arbitrary pressure on yourself. \n\nWhen getting new books: get a stack from the library that interests you (not in any educational or professional development way but in a FUN way-unless economics really does tickle your pickle. Be honest with yourself about what is fun for YOU). Pick up the first book that draws you and read the first page. If you're not into it, try the next one. Read one or two of the books you got and take the rest back (i.e. allow yourself to DNF books and never feel bad about it because that's just silly). \n\nNow at this point you hopefully have found something you are really into, which means maybe you have a new author or genre to follow, or even just rediscovered stuff you loved when you were younger.\n\nIf reading means a few sentences before bed, then do it. It's a muscle that has to be worked out again, and like everything else, it is an activity that ebbs and flows in your life. \n\nUltimately, I hope your doctor visit (and continuing self care) goes well. I wish you the best!",

Depression is difficult because it's hard to get motivated to even start getting motivated. I've found that listening to books that I would find comfortable are rarely helpful. I'll recommend Terry Pratchett's 'Going Postal.'  I've found it has a way of tricking me into getting worked up enough to get stuff done",

Diaries and collections of letters also work well. Franny and Zooey, which is basically two short stories, is my go to book when depression is winning and I need something hopeful. You can also begin working your way up to novellas as concentration improves. Becky Chambers Robot and Monk books would be a good, positive read.

When I want to read, I try to make sure I\u2019m relaxed, somewhere quiet, with my phone on airplane mode and nothing electronic around to distract me (unless I\u2019m using an e-reader, in which case I make sure the wifi is off).  When it gets especially difficult, I read quietly aloud, or turn on an audiobook and read at the same pace as the narrator, which slows me down and helps me take in the content better.\n\nAt other times I struggle with the \"slump,\" which I define as a period of time where nothing seems appealing.  When that happens I try to select a nonfiction book on a topic that usually interests me, because I find I can sometimes convince my brain that a book I\u2019m not drawn towards because of depression/med fog/etc is worth reading right now because at least it\u2019s something \"real.\"  Silly, but it works more often than not.  Trips to the library or a thrift shop can help too, because the dopamine rush of finding a book you want to take home can override the slumpiness sometimes.  Trying five pages of a bunch of books also works for me when all else fails - you never know what your brain might latch onto and want to read when it\u2019s struggling.\n\nBest of luck, kind stranger.

If you do, you\u2019ll start having negative feelings towards reading and when you\u2019re well again you might not want to read because of it. Just take your time. Work on you. Maybe have a few different books on the go - ones that really motivate you. When you feel up for it, give it a go. \n\nBut most of all know that this is only temporary. With the right treatment (whether that be meds or therapy or whatever), you will be able to do the things you used to love again. Good luck and stay well.",

I love reading but sometimes I can't read, I just stay in my bedroom all day doing nothing (sometimes walking around the room) and looking at my shelves and unable to even grab a book and open it. Sometimes my anxiety is so strong that it makes me afraid of reading books that have some conflict, where bad things happen to the characters, even books I like and want to read.

The past two years I haven't read much, because for a while I was really depressed and from internet usage my attention span dwindled, so even when I was better I didn't read as much, which made me more depressed because reading and writing were the two things I loved the most. Thankfully I've gotten over that in 2023 and am now happier than ever, and my attention span is coming back. \n\nMy best advice is to just take it slow. There's no need to rush through your readings - enjoy the experience. Also, you don't need to read for hours at a time. Set small goals for yourself, and after a while, raise them slightly, and continue that process.\n\nAs for books that I loved and which helped me regain the habit, I read: Moby Dick; Hamlet; and Mrs. Dalloway. All are books I absolutely adored, my favorite being Moby Dick, and my second being Hamlet, though I read them while I was feeling happier, just with my attention span vanished. I don't know your taste in literature but if those sound appealing, go for it. They are more challenging though so take it slow and don't expect to understand absolutely everything.",

If you feel hooked, by all means continue reading, but feel free rereading an old favorite of yours, or even pick up a young adult or middle grade book that feels easier to get through (I read a lot of middle grade for my job, and I've been really impressed by how good a lot of new stuff is being published).

I keep a novel I read when I go to the little sitting room down the hall. I keep a non-fiction book by the recliner to read while my dinner settles. You don't have to read chapters or entire books in a short time. That's what bookmarks are for.",

You may have to get on an SSRI till your symptoms calm down. I know they are band-aides but it beats feeling unmotivated. It\u2019s not fun so I would continue the medication if it you can tolerate them",

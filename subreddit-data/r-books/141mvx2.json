    "postText": "I just finished reading Lapnova, and I've also read My Year of Rest and Relaxation and Eileen. Her books are so fucked up, and I love it. \n\nThe biggest theme in Lapnova I feel I can identify is the contrast of the sacredness (or the alleged sacredness) of religion with the tragic absurdity of being trapped in a human body that defecates and copulates and suffers. She never wants us to forget that we are animals.\n\nAnyone else a fan? Would love to know what others think of her work.",

Kleeman is more surreal, though, and she's very much bringing something unique to the table. Kleeman depicts a different sort of utter despair that is much less detached and more like anxiety-inducing, I had a friend that liked the book for instance but said she couldn't *really* like it because it made her feel awful.",

    "postText": "One of my favorite book-related YouTube channels, The Library Ladder, just released[a video about the Ballantine Adult Fantasy Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqr1wsiYhQw) (BAFS for short), so I thought I'd share it here. The BAFS revitalized a number of pre-Tolkien fantasy authors, such as Lord Dunsany and George MacDonald, while also promoting some then-contemporary writers, such as Katherine Kurtz. Is anyone else familiar with the series? What are your favorite books or authors from it? If not, are there any you think you might be interested in?",

At some point, my siblings lost interest, and Dad was going to give them away. They did take up a lot of room. I took all of them, them and squeezed them into my tiny bedroom (my first one by myself, after sharing with my sister for so long). At some point, I didn't use/need them anymore.  I was sad about donating them, since they were with me for so many years.",

In 4th grade (10 years old) we would have to do weekly reports on a single subject using a world book. So every week we would have to go to the library to check one world book encyclopedia out to finish the report. A year later my mom convinced my dad to purchase a set. I believe it cost $750 (a months rent in Los Angeles) I can absolutely say that it spurred my love of knowledge and reading and it has made all the difference in my life.",

While the info in a Wikipedia article may be accurate, several times I have found myself having a hard time understanding it because the article makes no effort in making the info understandable or accessible to most people. \n\nThat's what I like about \"formal\" encyclopedias, you know the info there is trying to be as accurate and neutral as possible.  \nAlso, most of the time, I have found the articles are far better written and accessible than a Wikipedia article.",

I've always found the notion of encyclopedias itself to be fascinating, with the aim being to create a singular resource that draws together the sum of human knowledge. \n\nA while back I did some research on the history of the encyclopedia and it was quite interesting. I really think it's a shame that physical cyclos are nearly extinct. I appreciate the fact that World Book is still going. (They need to issue an edition with a classic look every year, though.)\n\nThe biggest disadvantage is that, for practical reasons, many articles are either way too short or, for some topics, there simply isn't an article. Still, despite their limitations, I still think it's a good idea to have a physical set of encyclopedias around the house.",

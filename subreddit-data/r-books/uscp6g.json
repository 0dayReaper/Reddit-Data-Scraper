She prescribed similar treatments for abortions. Describing wild ginger she explains \"a pregnant woman will eat it, either on account she languishes or she aborts an infant which is a danger to her body, or if she has not had a menstrual period for a time period so that it hurts.\"\n\nIn the 1st century the Romans harvested silphium to extinction because they were using it as monthly birth control and to terminate pregnancies. They used lots of other plants to that purpose, as Dioscorides wrote of wild lentils being \"available for all cleansing for a woman, but the most wicked women (making a pessary of it) apply it and use it \r\nas an abortifacient.\"\r\n\nAbortion is healthcare and always has been.",

Even before the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade brought Africans to the British colonies in 1619, this influx of \"transported\" English, Welsh, Scots, and Irish was a crucial part of the American workforce. The Virginia Company also imported boatloads of poor women to be sold as brides. The numbers of these all-but-slaves was significant: by the middle of the 17th century, at a time when the population of Virginia was 11,000, only 300 were Africans, who were outnumbered by English, Irish and Scots indentured servants. In New England, one-fifth of the Puritans were indentured servants. More indentured servants were sent to the colonies as a result of insurrections in Ireland. Oliver Cromwell sent hundreds of Irish Catholics to British North America during the Irish Confederate Wars (1641\u20131653).[31]\n\nIn 1717, the Parliament of Great Britain passed the Transportation Act 1717, which allowed for the penal transportation of tens of thousands of convicts to North America, in order to alleviate overcrowding in British prisons. By the time penal transportation ceased during the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783), some 50,000 people had been transported to the New World under the law. When the American market closed to them, the convicts were then sent to Australia. In total, 300,000 to 400,000 people were shipped to the North American colonies as unfree laborers, between 1/2 and 2/3 of all white immigrants.[31]\n\nThe British conceived of the American colonies as a \"wasteland\", and a place to dump their underclass.[32] The people they sent there were \"waste people\", the \"scum and dregs\" of society. The term \"waste people\" gave way to \"squatters\" and \"crackers\", used to describe the settlers who populated the Western frontier of the United States and the backcountry of some southern states, but who did not have title to the land they settled on, and had little or no access to education or religious training.[1][33] \"Cracker\" was especially used in the south.\n\nThe first use of \"white trash\" in print to describe this population occurred in 1821.",

They wouldn't have thought of it as code, exactly. \n\nCertainly they knew there was a connection between \"stopped courses\" and what they eventually recognized, several months later, as pregnancy. The latter never happened without the former. But they didn't actually know what was going on inside someone with \"stopped courses.\" \n\nWhat they did know was that it often resolved itself with time or with the use of common herbal remedies, and that what came out looked just like normal menstrual flow: there wasn't anything in there that resembled a baby. That definitely was not the case in a definitive pregnancy proved by the quickening (when fetal movement could be felt).\n\nThey also knew that menstruation could stop without resulting in a pregnancy: older women eventually stopped menstruating permanently, younger women sometimes stopped as a result of ill health (malnutrition, illness, extreme stress), and affected women could not get pregnant if they wanted to. So there was a valid reason to connect menstrual regularity to health, especially reproductive health.\n\nThe exact meaning ascribed to \"stopped courses\" seems to have depended on whether or not the affected person wanted to be pregnant, and also on whether or not the treatment worked.",

Yew trees are known as the tree of life and death and used long before Christianity arrived on these islands to induce abortions. A lot of the churches were built directly over pagan religious sites with Yew trees. There's one of them in England thats at least 2 or 3 thousand years old. There's also a line in the bible about taking your wife to the priest to drink a milky liquid to test if she has been unfaithful. If she has an abortion she was unfaithful. The bible and Christianity provide the instructions on abortion and they've got the poison out back. In my opinion one of the biggest reasons Christian leaders are mad about abortion nowadays is they can't use pregnancy to control women as much anymore.",

            "comment": "In the US, opposition to abortion is largely a modern American Evangelical thing. The idea to punish the killing of an unborn child was common because if a man killed his pregnant wife, the courts had to decide whether he murdered one person or two. The same applied to executing woman. The courts had to decide if a pregnant woman could be legally executed if the unborn child was considered a person.\n\nThe common rule was that if the unborn child \"Quickened\" he/she was a living being, because quickening meant the child was moving inside the womb.\n\nLaws against abortions became a thing later largely because it became extremely dangerous and operations tended to kill woman. Courts then had to decide if the doctor could be held responsible for one death or two.\n\nAmericans, up until the late-1800's, were Protestant Christians who were totally fine with abortions. Even today, Protestant groups like Lutherans, Episcopal, Baptists, consider abortions necessary if the life of the mother is at risk. The dynamic changes with the mass immigration of Irish, Italians, and Spaniards who came from Catholic nations. By the 1900's, Anglo-Saxons began discouraging abortions because they feared they would be replaced by the Catholic immigrants who prohibited abortions.",

There were treatments for it that modern medicine has identified as abortificants, but the people prescribing them at the time only thought of them as period restoratives.

Pregnancy at this time in the colonies was divided into two stages, pre and post quickening.   The quickening was the moment the woman feels the movement of the baby.  Only at this time was it considered a viable pregnancy.  Historically there was very little attempt to intrude into pre quickening terminations in Europe and her colonies.   However post quickening terminations have been debated for a long long time, including considering it homicide.   Depending on a number of factors the quickening usually is at around 15-20 weeks.  \n\nAgain though, it's very very important to understand the declinations of pregnancy at this time to interpret historical works.",

    "postText": "As a paraeducator who works in a lot of English classes, my days are filled with students who have all sorts of reactions to the things we make them read.\n\nWhile I've always loved English and went on to get a degree in literature by choice, there were definitely books I hated in school. A lot of them I still hate, but there are a few where revisiting them has made me really love them. \n\nOne example for me is beloved. Im not sure if a high school classroom is the right environment to really engage with that book, it's the kind of text that requires all of your focus and is extremely harrowing to get through. In college a few years later I was assigned the book again, and was totally blown away by it!\n\nWhat books were like this for you (if not love, maybe books you appreciate or respect) and why?",

If there was nobody in it I could identify with, I was too self-centered to be interested.\n\nBut YA didn't really exist as a genre then. My AP English teacher had to give us books like *Lord Jim* and *The Red Badge of Courage* and *Wuthering Heights* because they starred young people. But they weren't written FOR young people. (I still dislike all three.)\n\nI wish someone had told me about *The Outsiders* and *A Tree Grows in Brooklyn* and *Little House on the Prairie* and *Old Yeller* and (much more recent) the *Lockwood and Co.* novels. There's brilliant young adult fiction out there, and it works just fine for adults, too.",

It took me a decade+ of speech therapy to be able to speak at all and I'm still a stuttering, stammering mess, especially when pronouncing words I've seen but never heard.\n\nBut *seeing* plays, as opposed to dry and/or half-terrified readings?

    "postText": "Been an enthusiast about this book. My folks were the last generation who had to worry about polio thanks to the Salk and I guess Sabine vaccines -- seems like Salk is better known and perhaps his vaccine was more widely used.\n\nI was told by them about the things you saw in Nemesis, how people avoided things like public pools in the summer and I guess any public place. I believe my folks knew other kids who got it.\n\nI believe i have met people who had mild cases, but these people were significantly older than me.\n\nLooks like just last month they announced the director. I suspect it has taken so long for more than one reason: (SPOILERS)\n\n1. It is one of the saddest books ever. No happy ending, people do manage to deal with the illness and its results, but hard to imagine a sadder thing happening to the main character and IIRC one or two other people who caught the disease that summer.\n2. Ironically, Covid: I think they wanted the epidemic to be over -- that the epidemic occurred might make the movie resonate with people but showing it during the height of the epidemic, when people were not going to theatres anyway, would have been brutal.\n3. Besides polio, it deals with some other serious stuff -- antisemitism is a theme, not dominant IIRC but dealt with frankly and it was very unpleasant if honest. WW2 is in progress when the story starts.\n4. I think casting may be a huge challenge: It has many child characters and yet it is certainly not a kids' movie. The kids who have speaking roles will have to be very good -- they have to show that they are scared and they also, if this is done authentically, need to have the right accent and speech patterns for ww2 which were different than today. Accents were much stronger then, I believe.\n5. One interesting point is the main character is a young man, young enough in 1944 that he could have still been alive in 2010 when the book was published, but it is hard to imagine, in part due to health problems survivors have, him still being around in 2010 -- he is part of a remote and long-gone past now, especially since polio itself is, at least in most of the world, just a bad memory.",

To be frank, not being Jewish or concerned with Jews (maybe an antisemite would like Portnoy's Complaint also) and certainly not born in the mid 1930s, I would say I actually disliked those first-mentioned books or would if I read them now.",

                    "comment": "I do not have a feel for just how many were affected. I think that the disease was so devastating potentially that people were extremely careful -- I do not know if anyone in an \"iron lung\" is still around but some people lived for decades that way.\n\nNemesis was certainly a sad book, with a sort of oppressive tone (IIRC and that is really the right term) -- I think I could tell from page one that there was nothing humorous whatsoever and there would be no happy endings. Late in life, Roth told us about another thing that perhaps dominated his childhood thinking, just as ww2 and the concerns of a little kid if things did not go the right way in the war, gave us what I am sure is his most exciting, interesting book, The Plot Against America. Heck of a miniseries also.",

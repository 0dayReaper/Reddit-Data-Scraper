By that time of day I was at the end of my rope, the kids were tired and whiny, and trying to force us all to read was just super stressful. \n\nBUT, I would wake them up 10 minutes early every single morning and read to them before they got out of bed. It was such an amazing way to start the morning - from the time they were toddlers until my youngest was in 6th grade, every morning I read to them while they got their brains back online for the new day. \n\nI wish more moms and dads would realize that reading every day is the important thing, not the time of day. We feel so much pressure to do it at bedtime, but for some families that\u2019s just not a good fit. That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s perfectly okay to read in the morning, or while older sis is at karate, or after dinner, or *whenever!* Just read. \n\n**EDIT:** Since this comment is getting a lot of views, I'll throw in part 2 of what I did when my kids were little.  Once we got to chapter books, after we finished a book (not every book, but a lot of them) we would do an activity that related to that book.  So when we read *From the Mixed up Files of Mrs. Basil E Frankweiler,* we went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art; when we read *My Side of the Mountain,* we went camping; when we read *Kavik the Wolf Dog,* we went to a wolf sanctuary; when we read *Misty of Chincoteague,* we went to Chincoteague.  We went on dozens of weekend/day/afternoon trips/activities based on the books we read over the years.  Those are some of my very favorite memories of their childhood!",

The number one reason to read to a toddler is so they associate reading with positive feelings and will enjoy books later. So don\u2019t worry about not getting through a whole book. Also, I use to work for ECI and the speech therapist I worked with taught me that with toddlers it\u2019s all about building vocabulary. Don\u2019t worry about reading every word on the page, point to and identify pictures, make animal sounds when you see an animal, act like you\u2019re picking up and eating the cookies off the page etc... And, eventually- they\u2019ll listen to the whole thing. ",

Even if they like reading graphic novels. It's way better than video games.\n\nI worked at a bookstore, and holy, the difference between kids who loved reading vs hated reading was jarring. You know the ones who loved reading? Mostly girls, who liked reading about princesses/puppies/horses. No parent objected to that.  \nBut when it came to boys? It was so critical like \"Yeah you're not reading that\" or \"No that's immature.\" etc.  \n(Talking about the 6-12 age group)\n\nThe boys wanted to read stuff like Captain Underpants and Diary of a Wimpy Kid and honestly, the parents who allowed them that, were having kids who were open to reading more books when they turned 9. (And actual novels) vs kids who were 9 who barely read who were intimidated or hated reading because their parents fostered this hate for the books they would've loved.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I checked out the 2 yesterday and he's already almost done with them, he also shares them with other classmates and I think I started an underground manga ring in the 5th grade.\n\n\nEdit: he picked up the books Friday afternoon at like 4:30pm, as of 10:30pm Saturday night he was done with both books. I think each book was like 200 pages.",

The presence of the \u201cgutter\u201d (the white space between panels) forces the reader to fill in whats going on, a great mini exercise in critical thinking.  ",

Thanks for sharing this great tip Wishyouamerry.\n\nSeeing books, holding books, looking at print (not just in books but on street signs, and restaurant menus, etc.), singing, playing, listening to stories, and telling silly stories is a critical piece of early childhood literacy. So, if you\u2019re strapped for time or exhausted...build early childhood literacy activities and opportunities into your daily schedule in ways that fit your schedule. Keep books in the car, toy box, or diaper bag, etc. Toss board books into the backseat for toddlers to explore while they babble and you drive. Pull them out in stores while you wait in busy checkout lines. Narrate your morning routine (Who is wearing cardigans or corduroy? Or explain what you\u2019re doing while cooking. Talk about what arugula and sourdough bread and a pinch of salt so that kiddos ears are exposed to high vocabulary words. Make a game of it and call it witches brew. Ask them to help. \n\nDrop by your local library and ask about \u201cplayaways\u201d or \u201creadalong picturebooks\u201d for the littlest kiddos and listen to the story CDs in the car, or around the house. You have give them the book so they can turn the pages to follow along with the CD. The juvenile or children\u2019s section of your local library will have audiobooks for older kids that the whole family might enjoy listening to. \n\nToddlers, especially, are pretty wiggly so it may seem like they aren\u2019t listening and then move, dance and wiggle...but their brains totally are! Don\u2019t have a CD player? Not to worry! Your library might provide access to digital downloads services available via apps, such as Libby by Overdrive or Hoopla! They may even provide access to https://www.tumblebooks.com. Or try http://storytimefromspace.com for free. \n\nThere are so many ways to promote early literacy with kiddos. Just pick a way that fits your family\u2019s routine: morning, noon, or night or on the go. :)\n\nEdit: Typing is hard with fat fingers and excitement. Books are my drug and I\u2019m stoked to hustle!",

It was lovely to light the candles on the wreath, have dinner, and after that listen to her reading a story. Great family time, and a way to make the holidays more special! ",

He's almost 5 now, but we do it every night, without fail... it's just part of the bedtime ritual. In fact, a couple of months ago we started reading The Hobbit together after our regular bedtime story. He likes it because he can just close his eyes and listen (which is usually when he falls asleep). \n\nMy wife and I switch between nights... but even if I've got a bunch of housework to do or I'm super tired, I make time to read to him. It's important, I think. I don't know what your friend's sister's situation is - and maybe she *really* can't afford the time, but I find that hard to believe. It only takes an extra 5 or 10 minutes to read a story. ",

Eventually I could read that stuff on my own and didn\u2019t need them to read to me anymore and at that point I was reading all the time and buying books constantly. I\u2019m pretty sure it contributed to my reading level as a kid. I was put in the academically gifted program at school.\n\nThen once I was in a high enough grade, school started requiring you to read and do book reports and it killed my love of reading almost instantly. You can only read so many dull, uninteresting books before you don\u2019t want to read anymore. Also book reports on books I got to choose still killed my enthusiasm to read. I choose to do other things in my free time like video games, movies, TV. If my reading time is taken up by books I hate, I\u2019m going to lose interest in reading books I like. I don\u2019t like being forced to do things. It always kills my enthusiasm. I honestly feel like being forced to do book reports in school did more harm than good. I stopped reading altogether until after I graduated high school and my reading skills diminished greatly.",

When he was 5, we switched to chapter books, and now I'm getting to slowly work my way through some of my favorites with him. But I started dating this woman last spring who has 2 boys the same age, and she NEVER reads to them. I started reading them bed time stories because it's such an easy way to get them calm and ready for bed, and they loved it! They would beg me to stay and read to them.\n\nThe woman and I ended up having a daughter without planning it, and things have gone south. I had to file for shared custody because she decided I can only see the baby 2 hours a day, for 5-6 days a week. It's excruciating. But worst of all is that she's not reading to my baby! I read to my daughter whenever she wakes up, and she loves it, but she's not getting it as much as she should.\n\nPeople, it is SO IMPORTANT to read to your kids every night. Some people prefer to do it in the morning, but it has such a nice calming effect for them before bed time. But just importantly, infants and children need to be talked to as much as possible. No they can't understand you right away, but it's the ONLY way they'll learn how to understand you. Talking to kids is a crucial part of development, and reading to them is an excellent way to do that.",

I didn\u2019t think she was paying much attention, just listening to my voice while she fell asleep. But this morning, a full year or so after we finished the series, she referenced Dumbledore\u2019s Pensieve and how she could pull memories from her mind to view them again later. \n\nI have long wanted to start a Twitch channel where I just read stories for kids who want to listen to someone read to them before bed. Does this sort of thing exist, and what is the legality around doing something like this?",

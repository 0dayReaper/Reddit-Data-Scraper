    "postText": "We have a book club of 7 people and we try to read 1 book every month with progress updates and discussions every week.\n\nWe decide on a certain number of chapters every week, but often times that number does not stay the same. What I mean is, some people end up reading the chapters a lot earlier than others, while at times some aren't able to finish the read. So accordingly, we end up either increasing or decreasing the agenda. \n\nAs a result, we end up having a bi-weekly discussion regarding this over whatsapp -- which isn't exactly ideal. It's a hassle and really hard to keep track of. \n\nMost of us have goodreads, but I think all of us can agree that using it has been less than ideal recently. We were wondering if there is some other website that could simplify this workflow for us.\n\nAll advice is greatly appreciated. If you have any other tools that you would like to suggest, we'd be more than happy to give it a go.",

It\u2019s mostly a blogging platform, but obviously that will allow you to keep everyone updated on upcoming chapters, stuff will be sent to subscriber emails, and it has a native chat and comment feature",

    "postText": "\nInitially, my med proff recommended us this book but while i was listening i assumed it was all about how we care for the elderly in our society. I found everything he presented very interesting and thought-provoking. I mentioned it to my parents. To my friends,It actually caused me to really think about this for my own aging parents.\nBut then the book turns to the decisions we make upon receiving a detrimental diagnosis - - and how doctors handle giving the news and talking about steps forward. About what, exactly, we want in life, even at the end of it, regardless of our age.\n\n\nI know my description on this is lacking. But this book was powerful to me. It has reshaped my thinking on A LOT. About things we'd all rather not think about.\nI think every med student and doctor should read this book (the author is a surgeon, so it's very informative and comes from a place of knowledge and experience).\n\n\nBut I also think there's a lot of value in everyone reading it.\n\"In the end, people don't view their life as merely the average of all its moments... For human beings, life is meaningful because it's a story... And in stories, endings matter.\"",

A point I recall being particularly struck by that he made was that when people make housing decisions for their aging relatives, they prioritize safety over anything else, but when it's the people making decisions for themselves, they want to trade some safety to retain some independence.",

I found it helpful and insightful when a close friend was dying of cancer, and my husband and his siblings read it when both of my in-laws suddenly became very ill and no longer able to live independently.\n\nAll of his books are great though \u2014 you will get something from \u201cThe Checklist Manifesto\u201d as much as you would from \u201cComplications.\u201d",

Being Mortal is incredibly well written but like you said, it's about things we'd rather not think about so I couldn't quite finish it when I started reading it, I found it stressful.  This has inspired me to get back to it, it was a great book.",

A useful read for those who soon will become a caregiver, or will have difficult conversations with adults in their lives requiring care. Lots of small and large factors and decisions to consider, which may be best reflected on and digested gradually. Sometimes you don't know what you'll decide until you're in the position of having to decide, and when you feel choiceless, helpless and exhausted. This book prepares one for that situation.",

It's nice to read the thoughts of a medical professional witnesses the slow degradation of care even as the capacity for successful treatments continues to make strides. Between Being Mortal and When Breath Becomes Air, there's plenty of food for thought.",

I recommend it to everyone I have even a casual relationship with when the opportunity arises. It\u2019s been a few years, I should read it again",

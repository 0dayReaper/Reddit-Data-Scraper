The apparatus of China's Internet control is considered more extensive and more advanced than in any other country in the world. Western internet is somewhat available (minus Google from 2014 onward), but overwhelmingly Chinese internet users prefer to use their own search engines, content providers, communities, and utilities. The governmental authorities not only block website content but also monitor the Internet access of individuals and China routinely participates in VPN disruption and lobbies the largest Western tech companies to remove SSH, VPN, and other privacy functions from their products (see Apple's compliance with Chinese requests in 2017). \n\nSo while the banning of Animal Farm may generate some bad press and discussion in Western society, there's a good chance no one would hear about in China.",

The government was starting to figure out how to restrict VPN traffic and block SSH port forwarding in 2014 - which is crazy - Government does deep packet analysis and uses machine learning to find heuristics to guess which TCP connection or UDP stream is likely being used as a VPN. When the algorithm thinks there is a high probability a VPN is detected, they simply start dropping all the packets.\n\nThe most recent I looked at the Great Firewall of China was 2015 and you had to disguise your VPN traffic to look like plain HTTPS. The people who design VPN software in China are some of the best hackers and infosec guys in the world. It's insane to get a VPN working in China.\n\nhttp://blog.zorinaq.com/my-experience-with-the-great-firewall-of-china/\n\nThis is a great writeup of one infosec dude's experience with the GFWoC",

The Chinese government keeps them running because it's easy to monitor, gives a false sense of security, and as soon as 1 means of bypass is closed, developers and users migrate to more sophisticated methods. The NSA has broken SSL, as have Chinese government. Infosec in China is fascinating and fucking crazy. So people have been using Shadowsocks proxies to bypass the Firewall because everyone's connection looks a bit different. It's harder for the deep learning shit to pick up on the identifying protocol fingerprints. Honestly, it's looking like censorship is becoming one of the greatest innovators in infosec and computer science. ",

They reversed the ban pretty quickly from what i've heard, so clearly somebody laughed at them and they realised how fucking stupid an idea it was.\n\nEDIT: Just imagine a string of chinese characters forming a sentence, with n&gt;2 somewhere in the middle. Thats why it stands out, and i guess why they moved to ban it before they flip flopped.",

What I understand is that now there is no longer limit to how many terms the Chinese president can last (I don\u2019t think the correct term is \u201cpresident\u201d but basically this refers to the most powerful position in the Chinese government). I don\u2019t like the current president since day 1, because he seems to be very focused on propaganda and self promotion, to the point of encouraging people to call him Dad so he could be seen as a patriarchal figure. I was too young to experience the cultural revolution and the crazy propaganda filled times before that, in the late 50\u2019s and early 60\u2019s. But I\u2019ve read a lot about that time, and how those empty praises and pretended devotion destroyed a whole country and probably forever corrupted the minds of the youths at the time (who knows, considering Xi Jinping is of the \u201clost generation\u201d \u2014 didn\u2019t learn anything at school, only propaganda \u2014 that\u2019s probably why he\u2019s resorting to that method of control). Reading the news and opinion pieces from the Chinese official news outlets have been very difficult for me in the past few days. They were all shamelessly praising the change in constitution, how wonderful the great leader is, and how everyone loves to be on the right track for the \u201cgreat China\u201d. The bots and drones are running crazy in the comment sections to throw in praises. I don\u2019t think anyone would even bother to speak their own minds even if they don\u2019t care about the consequence. ",

It's really a critique of how power corrupts, and the failings of the Russian revolution and the Stalinist takeover. \n\nIf you really were a benevolent well meaning communist government animal farm would be near the top of your ideological reading list.

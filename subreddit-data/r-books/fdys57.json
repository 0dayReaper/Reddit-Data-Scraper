                    "comment": " George Orwell\u2019s enigmatic first wife was, it appears, an exact inversion of his second wife. Eileen O\u2019Shaugh-nessy married an unknown writer and then worked herself to death to ensure his fame, while Sonia Brownell married a dying writer in order to ensure her own fame. The names say it all: Orwell was christened Eric Blair and Eileen therefore called herself Eileen Blair; their son, Richard, was also Blair.  Sonia, however, who married Orwell on his deathbed, adopted his nom de plume and kept it even after she remarried.\n\nWe know a lot about Sonia and nothing about Eileen. Because the correspondence between herself and Orwell has not survived, Eileen has become what DJ Taylor calls \u201csomething of a black hole at the centre of Orwell studies\u201d. Orwell\u2019s friends found her defensive and elusive, Eileen\u2019s friends thought her playful, untidy, and a tad malicious, and Sylvia Topp \u2013 Eileen\u2019s first biographer \u2013 concludes from her subject\u2019s handwriting that \u201cshe had a need for attention and sometimes put an act on to impress others with her intellect\u201d. Eileen, however, described herself as \u201cvery much like Eric in temperament which is an asset once one has accepted the fact\u201d. Their shared temperament might be described as stoical and combative, with a turbo-charged death-drive.\n\nLetters discovered in 2005 to a college friend, Norah Myles, confirm two things about Eileen: that she might have been, as everyone agreed, a writer herself, and that her character was completely unreadable. In the first of the letters, sent five months after her marriage in June 1936, Eileen apologises for not writing sooner, but she and Eric have \u201cquarrelled so continuously &amp; really bitterly that I thought I\u2019d save time &amp; just write one letter to everyone when the murder or separation had been accomplished\u201d. To what extent was she joking? Could even Norah tell?\n\nIn another letter, Eileen describes the Blair family\u2019s response to their marriage: \u201cthey all adore Eric &amp; consider him quite impossible to live with \u2013 indeed on the wedding day Mrs Blair shook her head &amp; said that I\u2019d be a brave girl if I knew what I was in for, and Avril the sister said obviously I didn\u2019t know what I was in for or I shouldn\u2019t be there\u201d.\n\nWhether she did know is a moot point. On the one hand, Topp stresses that Eileen was \u201cnot willing to be a subservient wife\u201d and Orwell was uninterested in subservience, and on the other she argues that Eileen chose \u201cto abandon her personal pleasures\u201d in order to live Orwell\u2019s life to the full, a sacrifice he took completely for granted. Regardless of whether she was \u201cthe making of George Orwell\u201d, as Topp\u2019s bold subtitle claims, we are left with the strong impression that Orwell was the breaking of Eileen.\n\nEileen O\u2019Shaughnessy was 30 when she married Orwell in 1936, and 39 when she died. Dark-haired, blue-eyed, with a cat-shaped face and pale Irish skin, she read English at Oxford and was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d to not get a First. Giving up her dream of academia, she set up her own typing agency and then began an MA in psychology at University College London. It was then that she met Orwell at a party.\n\nTwo years older than Eileen, Orwell was a 6ft 4in maverick with a \u201cmoth-eaten\u201d appearance and deep lines on his face. During their nine-month courtship he worked on Keep the Aspidistra Flying (1936) and The Road to Wigan Pier (1937), while Eileen gave up her MA and all human comforts to live with him in a tiny 300-year-old cottage in Wallington, Hertfordshire, with a 4ft 6in-high front door, chronic damp, no electricity, one cold tap, an outside privy and a cesspool that became blocked when the wrong toilet paper was used. They got a goat to milk and some chickens for eggs and ran a grocery shop from the front room.\n\nWhen Orwell, who bent himself in half to get through the door, used the paraffin light for his writing, Eileen had to type his manuscripts in the dark. The kitchen flooded, the food went mouldy and Orwell, in denial about his tuberculosis, was permanently ill. Eileen confided to Norah that she \u201ccried all the time from pure exhaustion &amp; partly because Eric had decided that he mustn\u2019t let his work be interrupted &amp; complained bitterly when we\u2019d been married a week that he\u2019d only done two good days\u2019 work out of seven\u201d. These, Topp says, were the happiest months of their marriage.\n\nThe honeymoon over, Orwell went to fight in the Spanish Civil War, where Eileen joined him and had an affair with his commander, Georges Kopp. The couple celebrated their first anniversary in hospital, where Orwell was recovering from a gunshot wound through the throat.\n\nA central source of information about Eileen is her best friend Lydia Jackson, who claims that she was \u201cnot happy in that marriage from the very beginning\u201d. But Lydia, who had an affair with Orwell when he returned from Spain and was writing \u2013 with Eileen\u2019s help \u2013 Homage to Catalonia (1938), is an unreliable narrator. What was going on with these affairs? Topp vaguely explains that \u201cOrwell and Eileen seem to have agreed on a somewhat open marriage\u201d, the words \u201cseem\u201d and \u201csomewhat\u201d need further clarification, particularly given that Orwell\u2019s affair with Lydia was conducted in secrecy.\n\nIn the second year of their marriage Orwell suffered a haemorrhage and went to recuperate in a sanatorium. Here he wrote book reviews and planned Coming Up for Air (1939), while Eileen, whippet-thin and clearly unwell, milked the goat, fed the chickens, ran the shop, typed the manuscripts, and made, every fortnight, the ten-hour round trip to see her husband. Having narrowly survived the Blitz, she reluctantly agreed to adopt the baby boy Orwell had longed for. Their son was a year old when Eileen died while undergoing a hysterectomy. Orwell, meanwhile, was working in Paris.\n\nThis biography is meticulously researched. Like a mathematician, Topp shows her workings and thus loads her pages with evidence of her time in the archives. For example, we get the transcript of every school report and every tutor report for all three years of Eileen\u2019s English degree at St Hugh\u2019s College (\u201cMiss O\u2019Shaughnessy has a sense of style and when she translates correctly her work is quite good\u201d etc). It\u2019s fun for the biographer to discover these titbits but they are less fun to read, and should be condensed or confined to the endnotes rather than displayed like a centrepiece.\n\nThree anonymous articles in the London Evening News, that may or may not have been written by Eileen, are similarly quoted in full; we are given the exact wording of Eileen\u2019s father\u2019s will and copies of his correspondence as collector and surveyor of customs in South Shields. \u201cIf it is possible to cut a word out,\u201d Orwell counselled, \u201calways cut it out\u201d: according to his rule, entire pages of Topp\u2019s book should be excised.\n\nThe deluge of detail mars an otherwise moving and important book, and obscures the central question: what did Eileen Blair want? The sphinx has kept her secrets.",

Great story, depressing as fuck...\n\nBut The plague for example, is well, very depressing too, in terms of plot. But the way he provides context to that plot is incridibly touching and strangely uplifting?  I wouldnt call it hopefull, but more of a sentiment of not being alone in facing the absurd and suffering. And that there is great value in that bond of facing the absurd together.",

Trash has always been circulating the literary market since the spread of the printing press. We have more trash in the market now, but we also have a lot of amazing post-modernist writers.  I can think of many contemporary writers who have crafted beautiful works that easily compare to those that have been canonized.

Why we recoil from the dull. Maybe it\u2019s because dullness is intrinsically painful; maybe that\u2019s where phrases like \u2018deadly dull\u2019 or \u2018excruciatingly dull\u2019 come from. But there might be more to it. Maybe dullness is associated with psychic pain because something that\u2019s dull or opaque fails to provide enough stimulation to distract people from some other, deeper type of pain that is always there, if only in an ambient, low-level way, and which most of us spend nearly all our time and energy trying to distract ourselves from feeling, or at least from feeling directly or with our full attention. Admittedly, the whole thing\u2019s pretty confusing, and hard to talk about abstractly\u2026but surely something must lie behind not just Muzak in dull or tedious places any more but now also actual TV in waiting rooms, supermarkets\u2019 checkouts, airport gates, SUVs\u2019 backseats. Walkman, iPods, BlackBerries, cell phones that attach to your head. This terror of silence with nothing diverting to do. I can\u2019t think anyone really believes that today\u2019s so-called \u2018information society\u2019 is just about information. Everyone knows it\u2019s about something else, way down.",

Newly married, when Jeff came up with the idea for Amazon, she went along with it, upending their cushy Manhattan jobs, relocating across the country, and doing lots of the business grunt work for early Amazon (such as serving as the accountant) when she was qualified to do much more at much more pay.\n\nIt retrospect it worked out great, but it was a HUGE gamble. Bezos would not have built his fortune without her. The partnership is what made it work in those early days.",

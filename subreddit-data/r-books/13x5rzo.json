    "postText": "[SPOILER WARNING: This post contains plot points from Neal Stephenson's \"Cryptonomicon.\"]\n\nHello fellow Stephenson readers,\n\nI've noticed an intriguing thematic parallel in \"Cryptonomicon\" that I'd like to discuss. It involves two specific storylines: one about Bobby Shaftoe's recollections of his grandfather's perspective on the Spanish invasion of the Aztec Empire, and another about Goto Dengo's experiences with a cannibalistic tribe in the Philippines during WWII.\n\nIn one of the narratives, Bobby Shaftoe recalls his grandfather's justification of the brutal Spanish invasion of the Aztecs. His grandfather argues that the extreme brutality and human sacrifice of the Aztec culture warranted the Spanish intervention. The idea here seems to be that a more \"civilized\" society has the right \u2014 perhaps even the obligation \u2014 to disrupt a \"brutal\" one.\n\nHowever, later in the book, we're introduced to Goto Dengo's experiences in the Philippines. Dengo encounters a native tribe that practices cannibalism. The horrifying twist comes when his fellow Japanese soldiers brutally slaughter the entire tribe, using the villagers as practice for bayonet charges. The brutality exhibited by the Japanese soldiers far exceeds the cultural practices of the cannibalistic tribe.\n\nI feel like Stephenson was trying to show how justifications like the one made by Shaftoe's grandfather can often justify horrific actions if they're not examined properly.\n\nThis parallel has been running through my mind a lot because of how vivid and gruesome the descriptions were, even though I read the book a while ago... I haven't seen any other discussions of it. Has this stuck out to anyone else?",

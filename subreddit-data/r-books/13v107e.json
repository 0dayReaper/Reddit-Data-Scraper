I\u2019m impressed by his history of World War I, *The Sleepwalkers*, and I expect this will also be good.\n\nEDIT: And for Orwell fans, D.J. Taylor has written [a new biography](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Orwell/D-J-Taylor/9781639364510) of him. I\u2019m reading it now.",

A few that appealed to me was The Age of Vice, Dennis Lehane's new novel (Small Mercies) set in Boston during the uproar regarding busing of children to comply with the Brown v. Board Case. My Father's House by O'Connor sounded equally great about a Vatican envoy who helped Jews escape fascist Italy.",

I personally wished I hadn't read it and would have waited until all came out to decide whether to get into it.\n\nGreat list overall and the variety is good.",

It still wasn't amazing because it was repetitive between the various character povs and could have valued from a bit more editing.  It just ended in a way so it could be a standalone book, but very rushed.  Knowing it's likely going to be a trilogy, I rather it ended on a big cliffhanger and it would have felt like a better read.",

    "postText": "So I recently decided to study applied mathematics and IIT seems like the best option for me. From what I\u2019ve heard, they really set students up for success and they have such a good outcome. \nI currently attend a community college in a town not too far away. As applied mathematics doesn\u2019t seem too popular, what are my chances of being accepted? Especially as a transfer student. \nAlso, any recommendations on what to work on, like what will make me more appealing to the university? I spent the last couple years lost with no direction really and I\u2019m really passionate about this and for once I\u2019m really sure of it.",

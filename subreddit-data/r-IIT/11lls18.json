Additionally, a picture of Iron Man with some arrows and buzzwords like \"nanoparticles\" really doesn't communicate the idea you're trying to get across. I think you're trying to have a mass of aerogel that can be modeled into a certain shape using magnets? However, that's not how magnets and \"magnetic fields\" work.",

Tempered glass is very strong but will still shatter if you hit it with a hammer.  Also it's not magnetic. Introducing something to make it magnetic would mess with the structure leading it to be less strong, heavier and even more brittle. Introducing polymers to make it ductile would just introduce points of failure making the whole thing as strong as the polymer you're using. Also the amount of energy you would need to pump in to create a magnetic field strong enough to repel meaningful physical objects or EM radiation would itself be a hazard. Also, magnetic fields aren't magic, there is no such thing as an only repulsive magnetic force, so objects thrown in the direction of this magnetic field would likely just reorient themselves to align with the field lines and attract to it instead. If you want to actively manage the field response to objects around it to keep it repulsive, I guess that's theoretically possible but it would require a huge amount of processing power and near instant control over an already impossibly large amount of energy.   After all that it still does nothing against non magnetic objects. Bullets are usually not magnetic so that doesn't make this approach super practical",

            "comment": "Someone has MRSA. From the Provost:\nLast Thursday a student sought treatment at a local urgent care facility for a skin infection that was tested and confirmed late yesterday as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, commonly referred to as MRSA. The student does not live on campus, and no additional students have contacted Illinois Tech\u2019s Student Health and Wellness Center (SHWC) exhibiting MRSA symptoms.\n\nUpon notification, Illinois Tech closed Keating Hall and hired a professional cleaning service to deep clean the facility. Cleaning is expected to continue through this evening, and the building is expected to reopen tomorrow at noon. The closure of Ekco Pool last week is unrelated to this incident; the pool was closed due to a broken pipe.\n\nIt is important to note that this is an isolated incident\u2014not an outbreak\u2014and that the response was thorough and prompt. The Chicago Department of Public Health has been notified.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), MRSA is a type of staph bacteria that is resistant to several antibiotics. Approximately one in three people carry staph in their nose, usually without any illness. Two in 100 people carry MRSA. MRSA is treatable; there are antibiotics that can kill MRSA germs.\n\nTo reduce the risk of MRSA infection, the CDC recommends that individuals wash their hands often and clean their bodies regularly, especially after exercise. It advises individuals to avoid sharing personal items such as towels and razors, to keep cuts and scrapes cleaned and covered until healed, and to seek attention immediately if an infection is a possibility. Symptoms of staph skin infections, including MRSA, appear as a bump or infected area on the skin that might be red or swollen.\n\nFor more information about MRSA and MRSA prevention, visit the CDC website. Students may also contact the SHWC, located in IIT Tower, 3rd Floor, at 312.567.7550 with questions.\n\nFrances Bronet\nProvost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs\nIllinois Institute of Technology",

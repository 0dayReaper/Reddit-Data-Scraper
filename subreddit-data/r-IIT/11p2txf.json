    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nabout me\n\nI am a 17 year old from the Southeast who became interested in the Chicago Area for college. I have been accepted to Loyola, UIC, DePaul and IIT. I am hispanic/latino and come from an low-average income household. I have a 3.4 GPA and a 1120 SAT score.\n\n1. Which school is better for job placement in the CS field?\n2. Which would look more impressive when looking for jobs after undergrad?\n3. Which has a more solid CS program?\n4. Which would be cheaper after aid?\n5. Which has the best location in the city?",

            "comment": "I pretty much agree with the other commenter about the locations. What I will add is that for 1. job placement is I don\u2019t believe Loyola or DePaul are CS accredited programs, whereas both UIC and IIT do have accredited CS programs. Also 2. most impressive for jobs doesn\u2019t matter a lot if you\u2019re considering UIC or IIT; DePaul or Loyola however it might matter slightly, for the same previously mentioned reason. You should be able to find out about 4. by doing research and applying for FAFSA. For disclosure, I graduated from IIT. Didn\u2019t love the campus, and social life wasn\u2019t as good as the university I transferred from. But courses were decent, and I had a couple great professors. Now I work in fintech. What\u2019s more important than the prestige of your university are the internship(s) you do and/or the projects you pad your resume with.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, while attending IIT, I lived with friends in Lincoln Park. They all went to DePaul and my commute was a bit long, but I still think it was well worth it.",

            "comment": "The best location would be DePaul or UIC. UIC is basically located very near downtown. The campus is lively but there are still a lot of commuter students, so it\u2019s not like a ton of kids live on campus. DePaul is located in Lincoln Park, a beautiful, safe neighborhood on the North side. Plenty of things to walk to and do around there. \n\nLoyola is probably 3rd for location as it\u2019s near the lake but very far north. The neighborhood is not as nice as Lincoln Park. Last would be IIT. It\u2019s south of the city and a pretty sleepy campus life. It is near the South Loop area (by bus) which has more to do in the neighborhood.",

            "comment": "1. IIT from what I\u2019ve seen. Did a transfer leadership class last fall and a former IIT student talked to us and she was employed at Tesla and another student was employed at Amazon.\n\n2. Your experience will matter more than your Alma mater. Do projects, hackathons, internships etc., but as one commenter correctly put it, only IIT and UIC have legitimate accreditation so for that I honesty wouldn\u2019t consider those schools if you are certain you want to do CS. Loyola and DePaul are good business schools though.\n\n3. IIT/UIC. If you look at both course catalogs they are very similar and offer a lot of the same courses. DePaul has some interesting CS courses but again, accreditation is important.\n\n4. Most likely IIT or the other 2 private schools. Despite the sticker price, private schools typically give out much more generous aid packages and have a larger endowment to work with. I\u2019ve known people that transferred there from CCC and many of them said after aid they were paying what they would have if they went to UIC. UIC is really affordable and a great quality school as well. Scholarships will be more competitive to get since the student body is so large and there are many more applicants per scholarship. \n\n5. All of them except IIT. IIT\u2019s campus is one of the most depressing campuses I\u2019ve ever seen (especially for an architecture school) and it\u2019s location in the south loop is not all that lively. UIC is basically downtown so it\u2019s always interesting and you get a nice view of the skyline which is unbeatable. DePaul is in a pretty good neighborhood and Loyola is right on Lake Michigan.\n\nHope this helps and congratulations on your acceptances!",

            "comment": "If you're looking to take school intensively, IIT can allow you to take as many credits as possible with teacher permission each semester. So instead of the 18 cap, you can exceed it to 21 or even 24. Benefit of this is that your tuition is **FLAT** rate, meaning you dont pay more for less or more credits on your transcript, price stays the same. Take all 120 credits in 1 semester and you'll surely die from overworking but it would only cost you one semester (avg \\~20k) \n\nFor reference I had a 3.8-3.95 gpa, and a common to low score on ACT and still got decent scholarship. 70k per year total, 35 per semester, I got roughly 20k in scholarship. \n\nChoose wisely \\^.\\^\n\nalso our campus has a thriving greek life (which I am apart of) and a pretty mid campus social experience. Give it a tour for your personal sentiments but remember the food at the food court is the BEST it will ever be, not the average or potential mid.\n\nFor reference I had a 3.8-3.95 GPA, and a common to low score on ACT and still got a decent scholarship. 70k per year total, 35 per semester, I got roughly 20k in scholarship. . at the food court is the BEST it will ever be, not the average or potential mid.. housing / food is different cost than just edu tuition though so consider the options. the cheapest currently (might dissapear since bldg is old) is called MSV and goes for 8k per year (approx 9 months) so 900/month rent. But you share with your roommate.",

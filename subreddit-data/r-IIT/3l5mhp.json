    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm currently going to a c.c. and I'm looking to transfer after my second year. My major will be in mechanical engineering. I'm debating on whether to pick Illinois Tech or to go with UIC.  \n\nThere's something about Illinois Tech that draws me in, but I'm worried about the amount of companies recruiting from the school. Can you guys shed some light on whether it's a good choice or not? From what I'm hearing, it sounds like most graduates tend to get good paying jobs. How does it compare to UIC's spectrum of companies that recruit on their campus?\n\nEventually, I'm looking to move out to Washington or California. Would I be making a bad choice by choosing this school or will it not matter past my first engineering job?\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI'd really appreciate some input. Thanks in advance.",

You should target graduating not only with a degree, but also with relevant *work experience* and with at least one or two contacts in some industry (a.k.a. \"networking\").",

            "comment": "I am in your same position OP. Honestly I would say you would be better off looking for a school other then IIT or UIC. If you're going to a CCC currently you should visit the transfer office and see what better places you can transfer to. A lot of people have gotten into places such as University of michigan, Georgia tech, Northwestern, and Cornell which are top engineering schools and will help you out career wise alot more then IIT or UIC will (also all of the ones listed besides georgia tech offer a LOT of aid).\n\nIf you are set on attending UIC or IIT though I would suggest IIT. UIC is okay but they have a lot of their classes taught by foreigners so it can be hard to understand and in alot of the beginning CS classes you'll be in lecture halls of 150+ most of the time which imo sucks. IIT offers smaller class sizes, better specializations and their IPRO program is amazing.\n\n",

If I were single I would surely be considering those out of state options. I'm 25, married and have a son so it complicates things. I work as an IT analyst on a midnight shift for Loyola University Medical Center (pay is decent but no degree makes it hard to move around) so I have in-district tuition at Triton, which is why I'm going there.\n\nI think Triton should have transferable credits to Northwestern but I'll double check when I get home. Do you know if Northwestern has anything like the IPRO?\n",

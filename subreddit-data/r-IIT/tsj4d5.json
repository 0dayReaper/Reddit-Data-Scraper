I try to check every few days and remove those posts, reporting them so they show up in my mod queue helps. \n\nUnfortunately sub names are forever so changing it isn't an option. When I updated the color scheme and the description I was hoping the Indian Institute of Technology posts would decrease but here we are. \n\nOpen to any other suggestions.",

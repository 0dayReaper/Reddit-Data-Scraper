It's pretty easy, I just don't check reddit that much anymore and would like to put this sub in the hands of someone who has more time to make sure spam posts don't stay up too long.\n\nRequirements are that you are a current Illinois Tech student. I'll ask you to prove it by sending a picture of your hawk card (name and picture scribbled out for privacy) with your reddit username handwritten next to it. This will prevent IIT India from taking over the sub.\n\nDM me if interested.",

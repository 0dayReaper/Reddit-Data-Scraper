    "postText": "Hey, I am a recently accepted student to IIT for the Information Technology major. I had originally planned on going into the Information Security field, but I've changed my focus. I now want to do data science, but I mainly want to do Qauntaive Research in the future (trying to get into the stock market). I heard that is difficult to change majors in the school and I want to change to Computer Science. Should I still consider IIT?\n\nP.S. Information Tech was my second choice major and I'm not that interested in it. My first choice was Computer Science.",

The ITM advisor would probably also be happy to help you figure out how to make the switch.\n\nFor reference, I almost ended up switching to CS a few years ago but gave up on it when I totally flunked out of Calc II.",

    "postText": "If you are the child of a work visa holder (H1B, L1B) affected by the green card backlog or other visa holder (E2/other), please check out \\[Improve The Dream\\]([www.ImproveTheDream.org](https://www.improvethedream.org/)) , a youth-led organization that is advocating for 200k+ children of long-term visa holders (Documented Dreamers) who grow up in the US without a clear pathway to citizenship.\n\nDue to long green card backlogs, many children on H4 and L2 visas \u201cage-out\u201d of their dependent status when they turn 21. Other children on E2 visas \u201cage-out\u201d due to the visa not having a pathway to citizenship at all.\n\nWe are advocating for change that permanently ends \"aging-out\" and provides a path to citizenship for every child who grows up in the United States. Through connecting with Congressional offices and holding meetings with legislative staff, we ensured our inclusion in the Dream and Promise Act and the introduction of our standalone bill, [America\u2019s CHILDREN Act.](https://ross.house.gov/media/press-releases/representatives-ross-miller-meeks-krishnamoorthi-kim-introduce-bipartisan)\n\nIf you are a Documented Dreamer (on a dependent visa or have aged out and switched to another status), please fill out our **survey** ([www.ImproveTheDream.org/survey](http://www.improvethedream.org/survey)) and receive a Slack invite to join our advocacy team and network of 350+ Documented Dreamers! If you are a parent or supporter, please share this survey with anyone you may know in this situation.\n\nHere are some recent articles about children of long-term visa holders and Improve The Dream\u2019s efforts: [Verge](https://www.theverge.com/22585007/h1b-dependent-visa-age-out-documented-dreamers-immigration-reform) , [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/young-indian-americans-aged-out-parents-visas-appeal-path-citizenship-n1272817) , [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/01/1023393351/documented-dreamers-live-their-whole-lives-in-the-u-s-then-face-deportation-at-2)\n\nIf you would like to stay updated, follow our twitter ([www.twitter.com/ImproveTheDream](https://www.twitter.com/ImproveTheDream))",

If you can't/forget/whatever, don't worry too much, it's not a life or death situation :)  \n\nThe part that interests me most is toward the roof at the corner - the way Mies used materials and a gap/reveal makes it look like the entire North wall is resting atop the West brick wall and just hangs down, like a curtain, from the steel that runs along the top.  I'm not sure I'm describing it very well, but hopefully you'll see what I mean when you look at it.    ",

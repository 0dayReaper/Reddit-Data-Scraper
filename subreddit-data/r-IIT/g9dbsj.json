Rush university also does a joint program with IIT which results in an MD.  I went to school with several people who went the biomed eng. route and went on to med school. I'm not aware of any dedicated premed program though.",

Specific info [here](https://www.iit.edu/academics/pre-health-pre-med/dual-admission).   \nThe majority that do the pre-med will do it bc of the financial incentive.   \nThere is research opportunity but you need to self -initiate yourself. People will not hold your hand in college.   \nSame goes with extra circulars. The way things are with IIT - it's the way you make it. If you put the time in, you will get the reward.  If you want to make a club and are dedicated, you can do it. Idk what extra circulars you're into, but IIT has some niche stuff around and a decently dedicated gaming community. Can answer more if you have a specific one you're looking into if you reply.   \n\n\nIdk what defines a good mental health school but IIT always gets rated as a 'sad school' but when I was there the only thing that made me sad was that taco thursdays were every other thursday and not every thursday.   \n\n\nCampus life is also again what you make of it. They lottery raffle sport tickets, have big fairs/carnivals once a semester, and occasional music tickets. There's usually a helicopter tourist trip they offer that sells out instantly too.",

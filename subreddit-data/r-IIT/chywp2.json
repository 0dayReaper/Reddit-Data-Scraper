I\u2019d really love to know some tips and tricks to get an internship. How did you get one? What did you do? \n\nPS: Did you had projects on your resume?\n\nYour response is appreciated!",

            "comment": "The four \"keys\" to getting a CS internship are CS meetups, hackathons, projects, and career fairs. I'll try to break down each of these. \n\nCS meetups: All IIT students have a UPass, which grants them unlimited rides on CTA trains/busses. Our campus is within the vicinity of downtown Chicago, so please take the opportunity to go to meetups. There are a wide variety of meetups you can find on meetup.com. Try to find ones that are of your particular interest (mobile app development, machine learning, data science, etc). Meetups tend to be held after 5 pm on weekdays, or on weekends, so they may be compatible with your course schedule. At meetups, you'll be given the opportunity to pick up new skills and converse with software engineers. I've received business connections and job recommendations solely by striking up conversations with people at events. I recommend [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org).\n\nHackathons: Hackathons may seem intimidating if you're not familiar with any particular programming language, but that's not a big problem (I still urge you to learn at least one language, though). Hackathons are offered all throughout the school year. They typically last the duration of an entire weekend, so plan accordingly. If you're eager to participate in Hackathons, I strongly urge you to join our ACM organization on campus. ACM participates in several hackathons throughout the year and provides free transportation to them. At Hackathons, you'll be able to socialize and create projects that are worthy of being noted on a resume.\n\nProjects: There's no particular golden rule for projects. If anything, it may be best to make several projects of varying topics, so that you can display your range of skills. However, if you're adamant on focusing on only one field of interest (i.e. ML, mobile app dev, databases, etc) instead of many, that's fine too. If you don't already have a github account, create one now. Github is an industry standard tool in the software industry, so take some time to learn it now! You can use github to \"log\" your projects and show them off to employers.\n\nCareer Fairs: The Office of Career Services offers a Career Fair in the Fall and the Spring. You'll have the opportunity to meet representatives of many companies, so it's a good idea to brush up on your communication skills. Career Services also offers a \"Career Fair Prep Night\" where students can go to have their resume reviewed. Additionally, they have a photographer that can take professional headshots of you for free. I suggest dropping by Career Services every now and then for internship advice.  They'll help you to their heart's content for free, it's their job. Outside of IIT, you may find career fairs being hosted downtown. AFAIK, 1871 hosts one.\n\nIn your case, it would be fairly difficult to find an internship by next summer, but it's not entirely impossible. I assume your only CS knowledge by that time will be up to CS 116 or 330. You might want to at least complete CS 331 because you may run into data structures problems at interviews. I would recommend taking CS classes next summer, but you do you.",

            "comment": "I am just finishing up my first internship, about to enter my Junior year at IIT.\n\nFirst of all, getting internships isn\u2019t as scary as some people make it out to be. I feel that people are afraid of it just because it does require some work to set everything up. I did 3 main things to get my internship:\n\n1.\tWorked really hard on my resume\n2.\tWent to the IIT career fair both semesters\n3.\tApplied to internships online.\n\nThat way I got both offers from companies at the career fair, and online. \n\nResume: The career services are really helpful when it comes to perfecting your resume, even when you dont have any prior work experience. All I had on mine were non-tech related jobs (pizza delivery, grocery clerk), and school projects. It\u2019s all about showing that you care, and that you are willing to work. So if you have something on your resume, its not about whether its something very big, its about you being able to talk about it with passion. \n\nCareer Fair: Everytime the career fair is coming up, I download the fairs app, look through all the companies that im interested in, i apply to their internships, and then during the fair itself i try to make a good impression! Career fair is NOT a job interview. You are not trying to get hired, you are trying to be remembered so when the company reviews all the intern resumes, they remember you. Ask them about the company, why they like working for it, and how the internship program looks like! Make it a nice,friendly, interesting conversation. Not every recruiter will be like that (some are just there to hand out pamphlets...), but i believe that is the way to go! \n\nOnline: I personally used indeed.com. Obviously you have higher chances of getting an intenrship if you apply to more places! Go on a job searching site, look up internships in a field that intrests you (or just type in computer science to get all the results), and look through companies! Once you have your resume, applying is easy. Its just very tedious, so dedicate an afternoon or two for applying. It\u2019s never too early to do that! \n\nLong story short; create a strong resume and review it few times with career services or with a friend that has previous experience. Apply to internships for companies that are coming to the career fair / companies posting on job sites. Leave good impressions by sending out thank you emails, being interested in the company, and showing that you are passionate about what you worked on!\n\nI read through /u/M1A8 \u2018s comment and I recommend taking that users advice too! Everyones path to internships / jobs is different, and he had a lot of good things in his comment that i never experienced (like hackathons) that would definitely shine on your resume! \n\nFeel free to DM me if you want any further info or help with the internship search! We can even meet up on campus once the semester begins.\n\nGood luck, and don\u2019t worry! If you put in some work, you will get an internship for sure :)\n\nEdit: Fixed some wording. Typed on mobile, sorry for any typos I missed!",

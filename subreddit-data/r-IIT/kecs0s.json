    "postText": "Hey guys. So one thing that\u2019s scaring me about IIT is a lot of people saying students there are generally depressed, the campus is grey, and there isn\u2019t a social scene whatsoever. Is there any truth to this? If so, do you any of you current students have any tips on how to counter this? I really don\u2019t want to have a lack of social life.",

But I tried making as many friends as I could in my first year and now I have a great social life (well before Covid I did). I would recommend joining a bunch of group chats your first few weeks and going out into chicago for some adventures with them, the city has so much to offer and staying on the IIT campus all semester will get old fast. You'll be fine, the people who complain about lack of social life just don't put in the effort to find those experiences.",

If u plan on going to a school to meet new people and experience that college life UIUC will be better",

But, that's because I went to student org events, joined group chats, and found people to explore the city with. Now I lead a club, have friends in all my classes, and will probably stay friends with many IIT people after I graduate. During covid times, your best bet is to reach out to people in your classes, or sign up for student organization emails. I will say that iit's social setting isn't for everyone. We're not a party school, and most people tend towards a smaller, deeper circle of friends, versus a larger circle.",

I mean it depends on your interests, if you\u2019re looking for good parties IIT is not it in my opinion because I hate parties that are solely centered around beer pong and just standing there talking. Depending on your demographics the school is either fits like a glove or a fit from hell, and for me it was hell and me questioning why I never transferred. I think it just adds to why we\u2019re the top 10 schools for most depressed",

I guess more alternative/goth type things but I doubt IIT has students of different subcultures. But again, is that actually a real stat? Is there a source?",

Don\u2019t get me wrong the school is very diverse however depending on what type of diversity you\u2019re looking for is the challenge (for me the school had very little black culture) but you get to meet a lot of people from everywhere and I do believe there are a bunch of alt students. So it really just depends",

If you're more interested in partying and clubbing, that  exists there too but you have to know where to look. Moreover you're in reach of other college campuses like UIC and Loyola if you're looking to expand your social footprint that way",

There aren\u2019t parties on campus super frequently, but if you want to go there\u2019s always a guy who knows a guy who\u2019s inviting people to UIC and Depaul Parties. If you\u2019re looking for good friends and close relationships iit\u2019s greek life will definitely provide that. If you\u2019re not in greek life you can still stay very social, I was my first semester, it\u2019s just that with COVID right now there are dozens of restrictions holding that back. Hopefully by the time you start, things will be mostly back to normal. Hope That was helpful \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

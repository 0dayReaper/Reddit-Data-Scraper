    "postText": "Hi! I'm going to go to IIT this fall but I was wondering where the best place would be for me to dorm. I am hoping to dorm with a friend. \" First-year students can choose between living in Cunningham Hall (new in fall 2021!), George J. Kacek Hall, Rowe Village (formally known as State Street Village), and McCormick Student Village. \" are the options. Any advice would be great! Thanks!",

            "comment": "This is what I have heard from other students. Gonna keep it at impressions/vibes.  Only ever spent a semester in MSV. \n\nMSV: It is a collection of buildings that each actual hall is different. Kinda of a hit or miss. Some people like their hall others don't.  Overall not the worst choice but not the best. Several ears to hang out. You will typically see someone else. For sure the stereotype of basic college living. Simple rooms but large desks and enough space to be comfortable.\n\n\nCunningham: Currently in the process of being renovated but will be the exact same as Kacek. \n\nKacek: Was recent gutted and rebuilt for Fall 2020. I hear the walls are thin and the desks are not very big. But there is large study spaces on each floor. The shell of the building is the same as Cunningham just renovated. Overall not heard many complaints.  \n\nRSV: Long live SSV.  Building was built in 2003. Most people are happy living there.  Also has a small study lounge on each floor looking over the L. Rooms are fairly large with plenty of space to move around.  Is normally a competition to get into.  Pretty clean and you don't really head the L that much.\n\nEdit: confused Cunningham and Carmen",

However it's kinda falling apart. Not horrible but also the butt of a quite a few jokes.\n\nRSV: Socially not great, and expensive, but damn if the rooms aren't nice as fuck. Pretty good desk sizes\n\nKacek: Haven't heard many complaints but the desks are fuckin tiny. screw that.\n\nCunningham: I genuinely have no clue.",

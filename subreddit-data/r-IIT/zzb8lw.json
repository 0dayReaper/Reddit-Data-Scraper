    "postText": "I am an out of state prospective student try to figure if it's worth attending the Camras Scholarship conference. IIT job placement for engineering seems pretty bad compared to many other colleges. Most colleges I'm looking at are 90%+ and have connections a lot more notable companies than IIT at only 81% placement. Are there many good opportunities for mechanical/aerospace engineers here with paid coops, internships, and job placement?",

Unless you're going to a top 10 engineering school an ME degree is an ME degree. You'll have to do your own legwork to meet recruiters and go to career fairs and stuff but as long as you have good grades and can interview well you should have zero issues getting placement.",

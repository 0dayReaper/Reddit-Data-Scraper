    "postText": "I was an IIT international student from 2017 - 2021 and I received room and board scholarship from 2018-2020. I am trying to file my old taxes. Are there any international student here at IIT who received room and board scholarship, and received form 1042-S from John Kirsits? I found out that he is the one who sends out 1042-S, but I haven't received my 1042-S. I have been contacting payroll office and John Kirsits since last year but no responses. Does anyone know who to contact to request one? Appreciate any help!",

He didn\u2019t really know how to use blackboard when it went online so we had like a whole week to do tests lol. I\u2019d recommend just looking at professor Leonard\u2019s calc lectures on YouTube.",

I would say that he is approachable, gives great, in-depth lectures, assigns a reasonable workload, and is always available during office hours. I learned a lot in that class. \n\nReading these other comments, though, it seems like he's having trouble switching to online which is unfortunate because it was a really good in-person class.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a first year in his class so my only experience with him is in online classes and so far it\u2019s not going well. \n\nHis explanations are difficult to follow and he doesn\u2019t turn on his mouse pointer so we don\u2019t know where on the page or presentation he is referring to. Half the material is just through self learning.\n\nA week ago he told us to take a quiz at the beginning of class and then left the zoom call. He didn\u2019t come back and didn\u2019t tell us anything. We were all confused and most kids just started leaving the call. \n\nIdk maybe he\u2019s a better in-person teacher but for online classes he is really confusing.",

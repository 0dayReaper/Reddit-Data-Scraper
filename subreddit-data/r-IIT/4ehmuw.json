    "postText": "Hey guys,\nI'm a transfer student studying Electrical Engineering at IIT from Fall 2016 onwards. I'm a chill guy who also happens to be a Marine Corps officer candidate. I finished my freshman year at UT Austin and my sophomore year of college at Oakton Community College.\n\nThing is, I haven't found anyone who is motivated as I am at Oakton except one guy. (This guy also applied to IIT, got accepted, rooms with me now)\n\nDoes IIT have a fraternity that is known for being a party frat? I'd like to shy away from that one because I've got way too much on my plate to be drinking my way through college. I like meeting people who happen to be serious about what they study and stuff like that.\n\nI want to pledge during my first semester and I'd like to know what frats you'd recommend. Knowing that there are only six frats at IIT, I'd like to know more about each one.\n\nThanks for helping me out. Cheers.",

Fraternities are what you make of them. within each one there are people who party and there are people who are motivated to do schoolwork. Talk to all of the fraternities on campus, see where you fit in the best. ",

Triangle is a fraternity of engineers, scientists, and architects, with about 2/3 of the house majoring in engineering. All of the fraternities on campus are unique and have their own strengths and shortcomings",

            "comment": "I was in a fraternity at IIT from '07 to '11. As other comments said, the attitude towards studying and partying is not a universal label you can apply to each house. In my experience fraternities change trends with every generation - a serious and organized majority will be taken over the party people and back again probably within a decade - that's how it goes. Also, IIT is a tech school full of nerdy people and it's a small campus - it's not the kind of environment where an Animal House fraternity thrives, so any of the houses are usually a good bet.\nThe best thing you can do for yourself is to participate in Rush Week at the start of the semester. That's when all houses put on public events to attract new members. Every house will be very eager to meet you and talk to you at these events. Everyone's aim is to recruit quality men during this time. You can use this opportunity to judge if the people in any house fit with your values - after all, you may have to live with them for the next 4 years.\nUltimately, joining a fraternity at IIT is usually worthwhile. I found my experience to be a good bridge between being a clueless teenager and becoming an adult. ",

I've learned more about life living by myself and going to community college than when I lived on campus by myself with a bubble around me. I believe greek life exposes you to everything out there that you'd need to know when you're \"adulting\".",

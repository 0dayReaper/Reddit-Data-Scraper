            "comment": "IIT has multiple cyber sec degree options \u2014 the E.C.E department has a B.S. in Computer and Cybersecurity Engineering, the Information Technology Management Department has a B.S. in Applied Cybersecurity and the B.ITM (Bachelor's of Information Technology Management) which has a cyber sec specialization option and feeds into the co-terminal B.ITM/Master's Cyber Forensics program, which let's you get a Master's in Cyber Forensics and B.ITM in five years. \n\nThere's a lot of gaming that happens on campus just in the dorms, and a pretty healthy E-Sports team. If you can find the email for the president of the E-Sports team, I'd reach out to him w/ any questions. Know him personally, and I'm sure he'd be responsive to you reaching out. \n\nDorm-life varies a lot by where you end up. SSV is a lot nicer than MSV, the latter of which is fairly decrepit and suffers from a plague of fire alarms (around a dozen a semester, almost always in the middle of the night). Neither dorms get particularly wild as a party scene or anything. People tend to just make friends w/ the people on their floors and keep things low-key, so far as I've seen.",

I\u2019m myself not a cyber security major so I cannot comment on that but I feel IIT has a good set of faculty and connections with chicago tech scene",

If you\u2019re going for architecture major, gaming pc would help as you\u2019d have to use different type of illustrators, etc. I guess same for mechanical and electrical (though I\u2019m just guessing, do your research). Our esports club room isn\u2019t overwhelming I guess and you could go there to play during the business hours but if you want made some friends who are into gaming, then with your laptop you guys can play in yours dorms...",

This will allow you to get your master\u2019s a year faster than you usually would.  Also, a bachelor\u2019s in CS offers an information security specialization, which will help you get your master\u2019s in cybersecurity faster (there is some overlap in the courses required for both), if that\u2019s what your interested in.",

            "comment": "Very big gaming community on campus. Have a dedicated center/arena now with 14 setups (alienware, hyperx, the works) where students can come by during regular business hours to play and hangout. Evenings are usually reserved for esport practices and games for competitive teams. Big titles we do include Rocket League, League of Legends, Overwatch, Rainbow6, Smash, Fortnite, Overwatch. We do viewing parties, retreats, and other mini get togethers to build a tight-knit community. \n\nDoesn't matter your skill level either, will always be able to find someone with a game interest with you usually. \n\nIf you want to join the group's Discord you can at &lt;[discord.gg/iitesports](https://discord.gg/iitesports)\\&gt;. Good place to ask any questions about gaming or school stuff.",

    "postText": "So long story short, I got accepted into IIT about a month ago. Got my aid package and it was for 35k. I would still have to pay the other 25k a year in federal/Private loans. \n\nQuestion I have for you guys, do you think the education that you're getting from IIT would be worth me paying that much? I've tried asking current professors/dean but their answers are obviously bias'd since they work there. ",

I can't speak to the quality of the Computer Science department, but from what I have heard, they are quite good.\n\nAs to whether or not IIT is worth the cost for you, my inclination would be to say that it isn't. That isn't really a statement on the quality of IIT - as I said, I think it's a great university. But in my experience, IIT gets very expensive very quick. My freshman year I was paying $10k out of pocket. But over the past few years tuition has increased every year while my scholarships stayed the same. On top of that, the rigor of my program made it that I needed to attend IIT for an extra year to get to the point where I felt confident in my chosen major - which is a fairly common occurrence at IIT. All of this combined has left me with about $120k of college debt. \n\n$25k a year out of pocket is a lot of money no matter the university, and regardless of the quality of IIT, I would explore other options. Tuition at many state schools is less than $25k, which doesn't include scholarships you could get. I don't think any university is worth going into six figures worth of debt.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to DM me. I'd love to answer any questions you have! ",

With the amount of classes I would have to take there I would end up needing to take out almost 95k in loans, not including interest. And that just didn't seem worth it to me.\n\nDo you think the internships that you got in the summer helped offset the cost of tuition? When I talked to professors last month they made it sound as though IIT interns at various companies were paid 40-50/hr.",

Remember that it's not as if all students are guaranteed internships - you have to try hard and get pretty lucky to get one. If you manage to, you have to hope it's one that pays decently and not one where \"the experience is more important than the money.\"",

            "comment": "I am going to be attending IIT in the Fall for Computer Science with a similar situation -- around 25k in loans. However if you look at the breakdown of costs -- the Housing &amp; Food plan are what is making it so expensive (considering scholarships/aid awarded). After Freshman year, I plan to live off campus where the housing is significantly cheaper and where I can prepare food at a fraction of the cost. So after the first year, if you factor in your net tuition after financial aid/scholarships, and new housing and food costs, it's really not the bad. In fact, it was only marginally more expensive for me than going to my state university if I lived and ate on campus there. Again, despite my state university being affordable tuition-wise after scholarships, the room &amp; food plans drive the cost up.\n\nYou may need a 25k loan for Freshman year, but I don't think it will be like that for the other three/four years.",

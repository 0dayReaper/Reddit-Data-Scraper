            "comment": "Neither of these schools are great. With that said, rankings don't matter as much when it comes to job placement. If you're good at what you do/courses you take  or are able to learn independently then whatever you choose is fine. Interviews will test your knowledge and not ask why you didn't go to x y and z schools.  However, I personally wouldn't recommend to go to IIT. Bad experience mixed with school administrations that will do anything to make you miss registration at their own fault. Various errors on administration. No one picks up the phone or responds to emails if you need something fixed. Teachers are below average to mediocre (most aren't that concerned with teaching but are more research oriented). Campus is so glum. I would just pick Houston. Run from IIT and don't look back ugh such a bad experience. IIT is small but definitely not mighty as they claim.",

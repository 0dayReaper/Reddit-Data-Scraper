    "postText": "I've been admitted into the applied economics major. IIT offered me a $20,000 scholarship per year to attend (is this common?). I really love what I've seen of the school thus far, but, again I've only been acquainted with it for a little over a month. How is the economics program? is the 3:7 female to male ratio odd? If I went to visit what are some must-see spots both on and off campus that I should visit? Thanks! ",

A vaaast majority of students get something, but that does not diminish the fact that it is very helpful in paying for your education.\n\nI'm in the business program ( which shares some classes with economics) and we have some great professors and some not so great ones. The female to male ratio is better in these classes than the CS/ECE etc departments, and isn't too bad.\n\nThere aren't a TON of places on campus to see, because it is pretty small, but the roof of SSV north is beautiful in anything but winter. ( it's cold and I'm grumpy about it.) If you can get into an office or open room in the IIT tower on one of the upper floors, you're in the tallest building around and can see in any direction for MILES. We're close to the lake and a couple of stadiums as well.",

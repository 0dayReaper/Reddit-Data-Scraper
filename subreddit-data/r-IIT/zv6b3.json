    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI live in Lincoln Park and currently live with my boyfriend and one other roommate, and I am seeking a second. The apartment is a 3 bedroom apartment with 2 full bathrooms, enclosed porch, kitchen, breakfast bar attached to kitchen sink, Landry nook, Dinning room, Office, Living room and a coat closet.\n\nWasher/dryer is In-Unit, no fee. Dishwasher is also in unit. Enclosed porch used as a bike room. The dinning room is mostly unused other than storage and can be converted to your liking if you wish. We are on the 2nd floor and the apartment is close to fully furnished by my roommates and I. (2 ladies and a guy) We are pretty big gamers/geeks that keep to ourselves and are mostly at our computers (but we're not unsocial).\n\nThe available bedroom is 10'6\" by 10' by 12' tall. The room has a 5ft wide closet with with a built in shelf. Then an addition loft space that is 5' by 3' by 4'.\n\nRent is done by square footage: the vacant room is $680 plus utilities which averages about $47 each person for 4 people splitting evenly.\n\nSend me a message if you would like to meet up and see if this would be a good fit/check out the place.\n\nNote: Landlord lives on the first floor and does not allow any parties, nor do parties appeal to us. So NO PARTIES in the apartment, but feel free to come home drunk, just clean up after yourself. No Smoking, not 420-friendly, and no pets. (Though we like pets)",

    "postText": "Hey guys. I just got my acceptance letter (email). It states if I received any funding I'll get a separate email. Does this usually come immediately, or some time after? I'm extremely concerned about cost, considering how expensive the school is/how much rent is if I need an apartment. I have no idea what I will do if I receive 0 funding/aid, or if I'll be able to afford this at all.",

            "comment": "Hi, I graduated in 2010 with this degree- then jumped into a web dev job, transitioned into mobile dev, and have been doing iOS/Android work ever since.\n\nMy first 3 years I was on track for a Computer Information Systems degree, then I did a semester abroad in Stockholm. When I returned from that, I ended up switching  to ITM in my final year and finished with that.\n\nI think I made the switch because ITM offered a bit more hands-on web dev related classes at the time.\n\nOverall I was happy with the whole experience.\n\nI'll note though, there was no mobile dev classes while I was there, or at least I never saw any, but that's the career path a ended up in anyway. The degree prepared me enough to pick up those skills on the job and just keep running.\n\nIf you've got any specific questions I can do my best to answer. ",

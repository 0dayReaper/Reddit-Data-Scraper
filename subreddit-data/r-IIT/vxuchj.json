I activity did worse in his class than in physics 1 in highschool(which was basically the same class - the \u201ccalculus\u201d part is just a scam lol), and that should indicate the gravity of his inability to teach. Others have had the same experience - https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=457625\n\nI would recommend checking out rmp for all classes, especially in the future. Everything above a 3 is considered \u201cgood\u201d, and you should aim for 4+. \n\nFor physics, there really aren\u2019t any good lower profs unfortunately. But Kaplan is definitely the worst. Avoid at all costs.",

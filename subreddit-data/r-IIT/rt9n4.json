    "postText": "So I was recently accepted to IIT's PhD I/O Psychology Program, I've never been to Chicago but everyone I know that's been loves it and I would really like to attend here, but with the lack of funding available to students, I was wondering how students make it affordable, or if they just go into debt? I spoke to an adviser about internships and things of that nature, but between tuition and housing, it seems that schooling will be very expensive. I work for UPS in Louisville, KY who pays for my tuition at U of L, and I know Boeing has a similar tuition reimbursement program. However, I don't know if anything other than internships with the company would be options for working with them. If anyone is willing, can they give me an idea of their total cost for school?\n\nThanks so much Reddit!",

            "comment": "Recent B.S. grad here, so I can only speak from undergrad experience. I would estimate that a huge chunk of those attending IIT pay their way through using student loan debt. Some receive partial scholarships (such as the Heald); others get a full ride (Camras, Leadership Academy, ROTC). The school itself doesn't offer too many handouts, and I think most apply only to undergrads anyway. As far as graduate admission financial assistance goes, [this](http://iit.edu/graduate_admission/faq/tuition_and_funding.shtml) is probably the only useful page on that topic.\n\nYou have to take into account that IIT is a private institution and not a state school like U of L and also smaller (taking into account Main campus only). This tends to make the school's financial aid options limited. Your options are probably as follows:\n\n- Find a job that pays for classes as part of the benefits package. There are probably few of these in psychology compared to engineering, they only pay for 1-2 classes at a time, and you are splitting your time between work and school. IIT pays for your tuition if you work for them full-time. Still, you have to find that IIT job and split your work/class time doing it.\n- Save up working elsewhere in the field and then come back to school. A sound financial option, but I would imagine delaying is not something you want to do.\n- Suck it up and take out student loans. You will probably have to ask yourself if it worth it before you do (how quickly will you find a job after school? will it pay enough to cover the debt and living expenses? is the phd going to give you a financial advantage over working now?). The school might offset some of the cost with a scholarship or two. Digging around might produce some more money here and there in scholarship form. Still, you are going into the red for a while, and paying more than you took out.\n\nPersonally, I went the student loan route, but it was due to lack of knowledge and time to decide. Also, I had no other means of funding. The school gave me the Heald and I think something else small. After 4 years, I racked up about $60-70K in debt and now I am paying it off. Luckily, I have a well paying engineering job (my second one since graduation) and can deal with the payments without worrying too much. It was totally worth it for me. This, obviously doesn't happen to everyone.\n\nThere are two ways you can probably offset a bit of the spending. First, try to find a part time job, at least for pocket money so you are not paying for entertainment and food with your loans. Second, move off-campus into Bridgeport. It will be cheaper than the dorms and will give you more freedom. Some students rent apartments together for ~$400/person.\n\nGood luck! Chicago is a great city to study and live in, and you will hopefully enjoy it for the diverse experience it provides.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for all the suggestions and help. I didn't know IIT paid full tuition if you worked full time for them. I do believe they give you a stipend when you work for them, so that would help with food and entertainment spending. I'm also glad to hear its possible to live in Chicago for around $400. I didn't know if that was possible without living in a shithole. I've been offered $5000 a year from them and am the next spot in line to receive half-tuition if someone else decides not to attend IIT. I do think I would be able to pay off the student loans after graduation from the research I've done regarding average salary and average pay right out of school. But its still a huge amount of money to take on and the way you hear about people never getting out from under that debt is kinda frightening. I also imagine Chicago is a great place to make contacts and work with large companies that you might not be able to get in with if you attended a school in a smaller city.",

Its more that taking some classes (usually max of 2 a semester) is a benefit of employment by the university. Whether or not you can easily translate those classes into a degree eventually varies by the university, no idea what IIT's policies are like. I know a few people who took classes while working at IIT but none that actually finished their degrees there, they mostly transferred elsewhere and were using IIT as a short holding pattern before going to their actual grad school.

I think that's how PhD's usually work.\n\nIt's generally cheaper to live off campus.  Bridgeport is decent and has some reasonable rents, though you'll want to do some footwork and check out places before you commit to them (some places are junk, some are pretty nice, and cost is no way to judge).\n\nGroceries can be handled relatively locally.  There are some small grocers in bridgeport.  There's a Jewel (I think, it's been awhile) to the East of campus.  When I used to live by it, we called it ghetto Jewel, and with good reason.  Target is one El stop away or 5-10 minutes by car, and they have pretty good grocery selections these days.  \n\nI'd be happy to talk to you more about living in Bridgeport or around campus if you had questions, I did it for 3 years.  If you want cheap housing on campus, MSV is the best bet, but you also have access to the graduate housing and I'd recommend checking that out.  SSV is nice, but expensive.  ",

            "comment": "I'm recent grad in Psych but I'm also currently a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon. I'm in a department funded gig so I can't directly sympathize but I would spam the crap out of fellowship programs. Not only would that help you pay for living costs but it also looks good to future employers that you know how to apply for funding. It kind of sucks that IIT doesn't provide good resources to find what's available but [here](http://www.cmu.edu/fso/prestigious-%20scholarships/national/index.html) are some I get from CMU, everyone in my program is required to at least apply for the GRFP from NSF. A few of those are specific to CMU or PA but its at-least a start. I'm also in more of a CS field now so I don't know the landscape of Psych funding resources but I imagine some companies would have assistance programs, particularly if good I/O people were useful to them.\n\nAs far as living you can find a place in Bridgeport (the neighborhood across the highway) for ~$400/month + utilities. You might be able to find cheaper but the place I was in wasn't bad. Cermack food is definitely where you want to shop, the quality/price ratio is pretty optimal for college living and its right nearby, you could also just go ramen style if necessary. Most of the places in the IIT area are pretty reasonable for city living, at least compared to other parts of town. \n\nGood luck on the program, hope everything works out.",

                            "comment": "I had a car for a bit and parking it in Bridgeport is generally free with the exception of a couple places, the only problem is that parking it anywhere else generally isn't. I mainly used it for grocery runs before the new close Cermack foods was there, also occasionally for going a few places downtown that were more convenient by car than EL but that was pretty rare. You're also really close to white sox park and that makes driving and parking a total bitch on game days but if you rent in the area you should be eligible for a resident parking pass for the neighborhood which alleviates that somewhat. I assume grad students get U-Passes so you'll have free ride on all public transit during the school year and that gets you most places you ever need to go. I don't know if they've changed the system but you probably still get screwed over the summer. For the most part my car was used to defend the prime location it was sitting in.",

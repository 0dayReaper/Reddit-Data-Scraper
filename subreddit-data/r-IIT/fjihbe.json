If it is, does the school do sth to help the students find a new accommodation?\n\nBTW, I'm deciding between colleges and if someone is happy to chat with me, share about life at IIT and all, it would really help!\n\nThanks!",

Student here; IIT has been doing relatively well at being transparent during these past few weeks, with emails and a website (https://www.iit.edu/COVID-19)\n\nWhile classes are going online after our spring break this week, Illinois Tech knows it has a significant international population, so dorms and (at least) one dining hall will remain open. Unfortunately many student organizations and events seem like they will need to be postponed",

    "postText": "I applied for the Applied Math graduate program and got a conditional acceptance. They want me to enroll as a non-degree seeking student and take CS 401 &amp; 402 (where I have to get a B or above) before transferring into a degree program, since my undergrad degree isn't in STEM. For reference, I've taken Intro CS &amp; a semester of Java, plus Calc 3, Discrete Math, &amp; Linear Algebra. \n\nDo any of you have experience taking these classes, or with transferring after being a non-degree seeking student?  Unsure if I should accept or continue applying elsewhere. \n\nThanks in advance!",

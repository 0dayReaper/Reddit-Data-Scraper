I Read a few reviews from unigo and niche and I wanted to see if anyone here can tell me about their personal experience as well. \n\nI have a few questions: \n\nHow are the faculty and students? \n\nAre there opportunities to network with others?\n\nDoes the environment feel friendly and welcoming?\n\nHow are the facilities in general and for engineering/physics in particular?\n\nThanks in advance!!",

            "comment": "Hey OP! I see you're getting mixed and negative responses, so I'll chime in. IIT's campus does have a unique style -- specifically modernist, as designed by a famous architect called Mies van der Rohe. It's a bit of a minimalist Wes Anderson vibe, but of course, this means the buildings lack the Harry Potter gotchic panache of somewhere like U Chicago or Virginia Tech. In fall, spring and summer, it's pretty in its own way, but in winter the concrete and snow and lack of campus life is indeed depressing.\n\nIIT is a medium campus, so not huge like flagship state school, but not tiny like some of those small Christian colleges here in the midwest. I went to a similarly-sized campus (to IIT) for undergrad and it was a good experience for me, but there's also part of me that wishes I had started at a more top tier school. However, going to a medium one gave me opportunities I wouldn't have had with the competition at a huge school (e.g. scholarships, jobs, free trips, etc.). The key is to get engaged with stuff, because opportunities abound that many students never take advantage of. I'd agree student life seems quiet, but I am a young researcher so take all of this with a grain of salt. Of course, you can make friends if you join clubs or activities or live in the dorms, and downtown Chicago is a short train ride up the road, which is a huge opportunity in its own right if you're adventurous and have a little spare cash to go to shows, sporting events, or comedy clubs.\n\nI'd say the physics program is pretty good and there are some great faculty doing work here, good colloquium speakers every week, and nice students to  work with, although I don't personally know how the classes are.\n\nIt seems your parents are pushing you to make certain decisions about where to go. This may come with conditions on financial support and stuff like that, so we can't decide for you. However, it's your life, and yes the debt from a school can follow you, but your experiences and friendships will follow you too. Once you're 18, the truth is, they can't \"make you\" go anywhere.\n\n  \nQuestion - do you have choices at the moment, and are you willing to share what options you have? Or are you still waiting to hear back from a lot of schools? If you want to, feel free to PM and I'll be glad to tell you more.",

It's literally a few crappy buildings with no amenities. It feels like a high school building rather than a college\n3) Most teachers aren't great. There are only a select rate few that are decent. I had some bad experiences with teachers here. One of them literally said I couldn't go take my exam for the next class because I didn't finish their lab by the time the class finished even though I asked if I could come back after the exam to finish it. They just said its not their problem and wouldn't let me leave\n4) you'll have to self teach yourself. I learned nothing from the teachers but from YouTube videos. \n5) scam. They have no problem taking your money. They make so many mistakes on my account but if you dare be a day late, they will threaten to withdraw you from any registered courses\n6) All they care about is money. Not a single outside vendor for food and beverages. Everything is IIT owned. They are too cheap to hire vendors like subway or coffee vendors. Meanwhile UIC, NW, U Chicago is like a luxury place to learn for comparable costs. \n7 if IIT was free, go ahead and take it. Otherwise, please be aware, it can take a toll on you physically\n8) Just a gross school to be at (not a valid reason but just though I'd note it.",

Internationals come here with other internationals and the domestic students have friends from high school. So no one really mixes with anyone else unless it's to use you and your knowledge for academic purposes so that they don't have to do the work.  There are also people who simply don't want friends and are there to quickly get their degree and leave. In terms of faculty, they have their own lives and care very little about you. Their purpose for being there  is to get paid.",

Most teachers there are so called \"research\" professors so they don't really care about the teaching portion. You'll have to self teach yourself. They are smart but teaching others is meh",

I have found that the campus is great for networking opportunities. Kaplan hosts talks all the time with professional speakers coming in and talking about subjects like autonomous driving or hypersonic vehicles etc etc. The technical clubs like the rocket club or automotive club is filled with very ambitious and aspiring engineers. If u ask me these are the true networking relationships u should try to form.",

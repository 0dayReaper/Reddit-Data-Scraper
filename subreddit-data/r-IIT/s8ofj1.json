I\u2019ve submitted everything IIT asked for and whenever I ask how long till I know I never get a helpful answer. I really need to know because it\u2019s based on how many credits transferred that\u2019ll decide if I do end up starting IIT this summer. It\u2019s very stressful not knowing cause I currently school in Canada so it\u2019s a big move for me. Any helpful comments is really appreciated. Thanks",

As soon as the undergraduate office receives them from your high school counselor, your student academic page will be updated.",

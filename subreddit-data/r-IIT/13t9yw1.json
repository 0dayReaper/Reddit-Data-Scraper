Any tips, suggestions in registering courses would be much appreciated.\n\nThe classes for fall 23 are almost full right now and i was told that new classes for registering will be open in July, is this true?\n\nAnd what subjects according to you are a *must* and which ones to avoid. (Based on the faculty and the pass percentage)\n\nApart from these if you have any suggestions please drop them below.\n\nThank you :)",

    "postText": "I was recently admitted to the Landscape Arch + Urbanism master's program at Illinois Institute of Technology and wanted to see if anyone had any insight, experiences, advice about the program/school. I'm incredibly thankful for the acceptance and was even offered a scholarship, possible teaching assistant fellowship, and paid summer internship. I've read a lot of mixed thoughts about the school online, but plan on visiting soon to see it in person. \n\nIf you attended grad school here, how was it? did you enjoy the program/teaching style? professors? social life/extracurriculars? how was employment during and after the program? are students cooperative/helpful with each other?\n\nAny info helps, thank you",

Someone there might have some insights. (My daughter goes to IIT, but she's in a completely different academic area, so I don't have any specific advice for you. But my younger daughter is planning to get her BLA, and the LA subreddit has been great for getting info!)",

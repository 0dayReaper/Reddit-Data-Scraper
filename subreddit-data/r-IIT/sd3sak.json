            "comment": "As a first year architecture student at IIT, I would first like to say that the architecture professors are amazing, they are very helpful, and extremely knowledgeable in the field. Studio is project based, and it is truly the main bulk of architecture school. The equipment in shop is amazing, and the studio atmosphere is, although very hectic and work intensive, is unlike any other major. You are constantly with the same 100 or so people, and each architecture class is effectively like a family to an extent. The main advice I would like to give to you, and I guess the main disclaimer about going into architecture is the workload. It is by far the most intensive out of any program at IIT, and I myself spend probably an average of 40-60 additional hours a week at studio outside of class. However, I am one who always is working on studio, and it is very common and sufficient to only spend around an additional 15-25 hours a week in studio. The other courses in the curriculum are very enjoyable and extremely rewarding and interesting.\n-Nate Silverman",

IIT is definitely my top choice right now and I will most probably enroll in the coming few days as well. Thank you again for the information. Hope to see you on campus!",

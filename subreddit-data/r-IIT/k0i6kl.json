    "postText": "I'm about to finish undergrad, and I'm applying to the MS in CS and AI programs. My GPA isn't fantastic (most likely around 3.2-3.4 when I finish), but I have two majors (CS and Stats) as well as two internships in software development, with a third coming up in the spring. I wish I had research experience, but unfortunately at my university those opportunities are pretty few. Anyone have any insight? I see plenty of info on how competitive the undergrad admissions is, but not much about graduate.",

            "comment": "I got into the ITM master's program online and loved it. Best two years of my life. Walked away with a perfect 4.0 this past May. I honestly feel like my GPA got me in, it was a 3.7. I also was transferring from a PhD program in CS to master's in IT because I found I couldn't cut it at research. That last fact makes me a huge outliner I would think. The CS program at IIT has two tracks a professional one and a let's call it pre PhD track. You sound like a more applied person from your post so I bet the internships will look good. I am terrible at standardized tests thanks to anxiety so bombed the GRE multiple times so just didn't submit it and applied for a waiver. If you are good at abstract thought and could ace the quantitative section of the GRE it could off set your GPA which isn't terrible by the way. I think you stand a good chance of getting in! It might interest you to know that the ITM department has a software development track as well and also has slightly lower admission requirements compared to CS and can be done entirely online from anywhere in the country.",

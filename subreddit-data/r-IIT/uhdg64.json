I think that one reason that you may be getting limited responses is due to the limited nature of your inquiry.  They are good questions but I am not sure how many MSCS students are active here to answer them.\n\nGood luck in your decision making and I hope that you enjoy wherever you end up attending.",

Its truly  what you make of it. It's competitive in general to get internships and jobs but that's in any major city or school. For jobs you are competing against the world.",

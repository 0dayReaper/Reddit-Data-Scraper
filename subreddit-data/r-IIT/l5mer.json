    "postText": "Wondering if there are any MTG players on campus who are looking for a casual play group. There are 4 of us who currently play reguarly whenever we can and we'd like to get some more people.\n\nWe play mostly casual stuff that is non format but also play a lot of EDH/Commander. We also play a little Legacy and Modern. Arch enemy and a few other multi play styles get mixed in quite often as well. ",

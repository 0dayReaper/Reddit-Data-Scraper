    "postText": "I just finished my first year at DePaul (cs major) and I have a 3.6 gpa. It was previously 3.75 but I got a C+ in and a B- in 2 of my major classes. I had a really rough month and messed up on my finals. I got into IIT senior year of hs but didn't go bc people told me that it sucked but I really hate DePaul and it isnt really that good for what I'm studying. I'm also really poor so scholarships matter a lot. Do I have a shot at transferring or did I just mess up everything for good?",

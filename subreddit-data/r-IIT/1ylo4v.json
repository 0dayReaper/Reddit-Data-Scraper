We\u2019re hosting a recurring Ruby on Rails meetup at our space, [Blue1647](http://blue1647.com), beginning March 8th (2p-4p) directly after our cohort of web &amp; mobile development classes.\n\nWhether you\u2019re well-versed in RoR\u2019s, or interested in learning web or mobile development, you're invited! There will be other students from other places (our TA is an intern at a Dev firm and UIC student), and aspiring developers\u2019 from our web development classes. We think it\u2019ll be a great opportunity to network, socialize, and learn from local developers in a dynamic space for free. \n\nWe\u2019ve hosted Hackathons\u2019 before, and if anyone is interested you are more than welcome to invite others!\n\nLastly, I cofounded a few programs there, and I\u2019m more than happy to offer any opportunities from discounts on hand's-on programming classes (weekends, beginning march 1st), to meeting space for fellow students or organizations and more \u2013 just ask. Really. Feel free to message me, and I\u2019ll send my contact info. \n",

            "comment": "Program itself is strong - you'll get a good grasp of the field with a variety of classes, and can cater 2-3 specific classes towards your interest in your senior year \\[ex: energy, design, environmental etc\\].   \nFrom what I've been hearing the staffing has been an issue for the past few years, with new professors taking over making the material sometimes inconsistent. I was fortunate enough to have relatively good experience(s) with all mine. \n\nProfessional networking is meh where the career services dpt lacks in holding onto really strong connections, however if you go out to companies on your own and mention IIT the name will carry you through those first steps in the recruiting process. Last bit of advice would be to get involved as much as you can to build your network - professional socieities, rec clubs, interest  groups - IIT is private so expect small class sizes and interest cliques. People aren't super social but it's not too hard to find a group that fits you.   \ntl;dr good academics, average extracirriculars - make a strong effort in leadership, sub-par professional network (imo)",

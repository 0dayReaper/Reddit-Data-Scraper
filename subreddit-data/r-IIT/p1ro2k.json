    "postText": "Hi everyone! Welcome to campus, and welcome back if you're a returning student. I hope everyone had a relaxing or exciting summer break. \n\nCampus is pretty quiet right now, but as you know we'll soon be hurrying across the lawns and sprouting mushrooms to get to class or our research labs. If you've been out of Chicago, things have been much more back to normal this summer than last year, but covid is still lurking out there and campus is having an upcoming town hall to discuss how they'll handle it for the fall semester. Remember to bring your masks and take your vitamin-D+K (studies show it helps big time!), and to get your vaccine if you haven't yet.\n\nSee you in a couple of weeks!",

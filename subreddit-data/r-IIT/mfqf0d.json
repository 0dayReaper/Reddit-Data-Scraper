    "postText": "Hey everyone, hope you're doing alright. \n\nI have received an admit from IIT for masters of computer science and I'm strongly considering joining. I was looking over at the housing options on campus(since I got a housing scholarship) so it appeared to be more affordable. However I'm not sure about the boarding fees and all that. Is it necessary for a grad student to get a meal plan, or can I just make my own meals, and what all does the board fees entail. If anyone fould help me in this regard that'll be awesome. \n\nGo hawks!",

            "comment": "It depends what housing you get.  I personally lived in both MSV and Gunsaulus.  Gunsaulus is apartment style and we had our own kitchen.  I highly recommend getting housing with a kitchen so you don't need a meal plan.  The food they have isn't bad, but you can cook food that's better and less expensive yourself.  I felt having a kitchen was a huge boost to quality of life.  Some dorms don't have a kitchen though so be careful which housing you pick.",

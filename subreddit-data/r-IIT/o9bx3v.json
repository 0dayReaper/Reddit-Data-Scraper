    "postText": "Hi, I'm a high school senior now and inquiring about the Mechanical Engineering discipline. I live in Wisconsin and my parents don't want me to go too far. IIT is one of my few legitimate options.\n\nTo begin, my first question is a general one. How is campus life like? Is it one that is very lively or otherwise? Do you feel that the ME curriculum is one that thoroughly prepares you for the career field? Are the professors the chill type, engaging, and make your learning fun and help you retain what you learn? Of course, there will be some challenging professors. But I believe that the professors play a crucial role in the development of a student and whether they can make it out of college. If possible that you please give me a brief overview of the ME curriculum? (i.e. the main topics that you cover. Such as, how much math will I learn, and to what extent will I learn physics.)I want to know what I'm getting myself into. Your input will be heavily valued when I decide which school I attend.\n\nForgive me if my questions aren't formulated very well. I try my best.",

            "comment": "Thanks for stopping by! \n\nBit of background: Mech.Eng Grad2018. Masters of Engineering Degree (no thesis) and Bachelor's in Mech.Eng. Got a third degree in eng mgmt. From the suburbs in the area (not out of state). \n\nCampus Life - what you make of it. In general the organized ones hosted by the school are pretty vanilla. Movie nights, reduced sales on sporting events, maybe a food tour if you're lucky. The student orgs are strong during my time. Student leaders come in/out with a vision to create a club (hobby, leadership, special interest etc) and usually get to skip a lot of the normal red tape that goes in making clubs as opposed to a big school. Def not your typical college experience when it comes to having fun here. \n\nMEng Curriculum - standard. Undergrad will have you scrape the surface on a variety of topics. Thermo, manufacturing, design/cad work, fluids, systems etc. Yes I use the knowledge I learned in these classes in my full time job (associate in an engineering firm). But the firms have their own specific industry (mine's energy/powerplants so lots of thermo/fluid/cad work). \n\nProfessors - have changed a lot since I graduated but there are 2-4 that I would consider the 'old guard' who are still there that when I was a student. Some will have office hours/attitudes that you will enjoy learning the material. Others will have you hoping to just get the passing grade :(\n\nCoursework -  Hardest math will be multivariable calculus and diffeq. Physics will be mechanics and Elec&amp;Mag. If you've done AP Physics C you're set. If you've done AP Calc BC you're already halfway there for math. Common to have students get those gen-eds out of the way in community college etc. \n\nMEng Strengths - imo the biggest strength to get your foot in the door with big companies is the name. IIT Eng still holds some weight in the industry (esp chicago) with a lot of veteran employees that have done 30/40 yrs in industry graduating from here. Do well on those core classes like statics/fluids/thermo and get involved with professional societies like asme. Use career fairs and build networks to find what kind of eng you really want to do. MEng always gets labeled as the most general of all eng. You have a lot of options with that degree and have the freedom for some unique electives to get more breadth in cousework besides surface level knowledge like advanced manuf, robotics, finite element analysis etc.",

In the city, there's quite a bit to explore and always something to do, even if it's not always on the campus proper.  Another of IIT's advantages is that because it's relatively small, there are opportunities to get to know other students fairly well and have a sense of belonging to a community.\n\nWhile I cannot comment upon the ME program itself, I will say that many of the classes (apart from a few seminar-style courses) will be small enough that you should be able to closely interact with your professors.  Don't be afraid to leverage their available office hours (even for the larger classes).  Best wishes in your future plans!",

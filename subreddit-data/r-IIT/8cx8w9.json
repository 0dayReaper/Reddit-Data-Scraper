(AeroE was 21st in the nation when I was there). The school name alone won't get you shit, but if you put in the work and have internships during your time there your job prospects will be better than a lot of other schools",

They understand and get their hands on projects and assignments that enhances their level of understanding in the subjects that they pursue. \n\nThat could also mean, you are preferred above the regular pool, but only by merit.

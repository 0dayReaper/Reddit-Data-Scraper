I\u2019m in the final stages of deciding on a school for my Mechanical Engineering undergraduate, I was accepted as an international student from Canada, and IIT is among my final choices.\n\nIt\u2019s exactly as the title says.\n\nWhat should I know about the school? What are your favourite parts of the school? Why did you attend the school? How\u2019s the student life? Are extracurriculars/club opportunities good?\n\nTell me about anything!\n\nThanks you!",

            "comment": "First off, your experiences at IIT or RPI would be very different than at UIUC or UW-Madison which are large state schools.  Smaller schools and larger schools each have their own advantages and disadvantages.  A big part of your decision making should be based on which school size do you like.\n\nI got my BS from IIT in the early nineties and had a really great experience - great education, experiences and friendships.  Access to Chicago was a huge plus.  I had three great job offers within a short time of graduation.  That experience helped me move up through many engineering firms to the point that I own my own firm.  I have hired many IIT grads (some with only a BS and some with an MS).  I have found that those with a BS are more prepared then those that I interviewed from UIUC (though the UIUC graduate programs balance that out somewhat for graduate students).\n\nSome of things that IIT does well are:\n\n1. Small classes, including freshman classes.\n2. Very good student/faculty ratio.\n3. Opportunity to take some upper level classes that are only offered as graduate classes at UIUC.\n4. Very few classes are taught by TAs.\n5. Good relationships with regional employers.\n6. Provide very good financial aid packages.\n\nI think that one of the biggest knocks on IIT is that because it is a STEM-focused schools many of the students are more introverted than those that typically choose state schools and IIT does not really do a lot to promote social activities.  Plus, the athletic teams to not really get much support which is a big source of school pride for large schools.  If you want to have social activities readily available for you just by walking our of your dorm room, then consider UIUC or UW-Madison.  If you are willing to take control and make your own activities (start or lead a club, join a fraternity, find off-campus activities in Chicago) then you can do well at IIT (or RPI, though Troy is not the most exciting town).",

Deciding between WPI and IIT.\nThis is some of what I've found about Chicago and IIT.\n\nRent is expensive than the average IMO. But many choices exist off campus.\n\nCity is really cool, many things to do. So if you make it to have friends, you won't be bored.\n\nMany students have described IIT as depressing, it seems that there aren't plenty of activities in the campus, there is no feeling of the traditional US college (Fraternities, clubs, etc) , faculty is sort of cold (not friendly). Check their Instagram account, not frequent posts. \nInstructors are very smart in their fields but not willing to teach but to elicit research.\nThe campus is not as big as others, some students describe it as a high school but more expensive \ud83e\udd2d.\n\nThe good thing at least in the area of Master in information technology, is that the program offers multiple specializations, looks competitive. The campus has many green areas, modern building, close to everything.\nHope it helps",

            "comment": "As a current mechanical engineering undergrad, I think IIT has been worth it for me. The curriculum is challenging but I have heard it's easier than UIUC. I would say about half the professors I have had were actually decent instructors. All of them know their field but others are just awful at teaching. I would say there have been plenty of on campus events to attend. There is even a free bowling alley/ arcade called The Bog were they occasionally host stand up comedians. I am also a brother at Triangle Fraternity. There are a few different fraternities on campus and only 2 sororities. It is MUCH cheaper to live at one of the fraternities rather than the dorms, and you will make friends for life at them. I am involved in a few different build clubs: a high power rocketry club, a remote controlled plane design and build competition, and one that builds a robot to compete at NASA. These are just a few of the extra curriculars I get involved in but there are ones for theater, music, intramural sports, art, running, ect. So there are plenty of ways to get out and meet people. The campus is historic, but also a little run down. They are slowly conducting major renovations to each of the buildings.\n\nI hope that helps. Sorry for shitty formatting/grammar. I'm on my phone/ American. Let me know if you have more questions.",

            "comment": "The campus has changed drastically since I was a student there from the late '80s into the early '90s, but hopefully some of these things will still apply.  First, it's in Chicago.  Therefore, if you have any free time outside of your academic life, there are unlimited activities to do in Chicago, museums, art galleries, music venues, festivals, food, plays, zoo, did I mention music or food??  The El runs right through the middle of campus, so you likely don't have to worry about driving, and parking in Chicago.  I did have a vehicle while attending school there, but I rarely used it.  The El would take me nearly anywhere I wanted to go.  Chinatown is not far from campus, and one restaurant, if still there, is open until like four or five in the morning.  I would recommend the Beef with Oyster Sauce served over Pan-Fried Noodles . . . so incredibly succulent!  Just down a little further on the main street through Chinatown is Ricobene's ([https://www.ricobenespizza.com/](https://www.ricobenespizza.com/)).  They have a large menu with many Italian items, but I tried one thing, and never strayed from that item, a Breaded Steak Sandwich, which USA Today claimed was the \"Best Sandwich in the World\"!  I don't know if it is the best, but it is definitely up there!  Also, Comiskey Park is located directly across the Dan Ryan from campus in case you are a baseball fan, or better yet, a White Sox fan, or perhaps just curious to attend a baseball game sometime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, more relevant reason to choose IIT is that from my experience, and observations, they provide a significantly better education than any state university or college does.  Also, the professor to student ratio was really low.  I don't know what it is today, but in my time it was about 17:1, which I feel creates an environment more conducive for learning, and provides easier access to your professors should you ever have a need to speak with them on a one-on-one basis outside of the classroom.  I only had one class during my freshman year where the number of students was significantly over thirty.  Wow, I can not even recall what class that was, but it was a Freshman course.  All of my classes besides that one were around thirty or less students.  There do have a really strong Engineering program from what I remember, along with Architecture, ID, and a few others.  However, no matter what you major in, if they offer it, then you should receive a good education.  I could provide a long list of little things, but the main strength of IIT I feel is the quality of education they are able to provide their students.  I would mention the cold Chicago winters, and the wind ripping in from off of the lake, but with you being from Canada, I think you are likely prepared to deal with such climate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever institution you decide to attend for your higher education, I wish you the best of luck!  Just don't fall in love while pursuing your degree, and then, have relationship problems develop, like so often happens in young love, and become chronically depressed to the point where it affects your academic performance.",

Also, if you want to have a relationship while attending college, your education should come first, and your significant other should understand that because your education will affect you for the remainder of your life, and if your significant other remains with you for the remainder of your life, then they should be able to wait a couple of years for them to feel as if nothing else comes before them . . . however, they should be aware that putting your education before their immediate desires isn't actually placing something in front of them, but instead it is doing what is necessary to provide them to the best of your ability.  Even though your education will affect you for the remainder of your life, odds are that a relationship you have while in college will not last for the rest of your life.

Merit scholarship of 20k and housing 5k. \n\nI did my O levels under Cambridge Curriculum (primary final exm before high school) and got 5 A 2 B\n\nHigh school for cambridge students is separated into 2 parts - AS level and A level where A level is the last examination.\n\nHad Maths chem and physics on both these exams.\n\nIn AS I got 2 A 1 B\n\nIn A level 3 A\n\nDid SAT and Ielts both. Sat score was 1450/1600. Ielts was 8/9\n\nGave my ielts results instead of sat. \n\nMy highschool class mocks went great with pretty good improvements so transcript from high school was a big asset.\n\nAnd thats more or less it. Starting in spring. I got admission in other good uni aswell but those starts from Fall next year. Dont want to waste a year.",

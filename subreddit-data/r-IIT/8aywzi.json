It's a very nice quiet neighborhood that's starting to get some neat restaurants. Halsted is the main street where all the stores are if you want to live near some restaurants and the closest grocery store. \n\nThe apartments above the Starbucks on 35th and state are pretty nice, but there can be some questionable characters that loiter there sometimes. I think that's kind of true for most of Chicago that's not in the loop. Just be smart and vigilant. Dont walk around in the evenings and nighttime alone and you should be fine. ",

            "comment": "The campus's location is fairly safe and there's a police station adjacent to the campus. Crime is definitely not uncommon around the campus. Most of the instances of crime on the campus are muggings and burglaries. Also, anything south of 35th is sketchy.\n\nRegarding the neighborhood, /u/bacoon is right. Options for food or drinks are limited.\n\nI recommend moving to somewhere around the South Loop or Near South Side. IIT is located between a CTA Red Line and a Green Line stop (Sox-35th and 35th-Bronzeville-IIT respectively), so you can easily commute to IIT by train within 10-20 mins.\n\nIf your budget doesn't allow for you to live in that area, I would suggest taking /u/sojuqueen's advice and stick to Bridgeport.\n\nI wish you the best of luck on your work.",

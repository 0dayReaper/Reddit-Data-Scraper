This will allow you to get your master\u2019s a year faster than you usually would.  Also, a bachelor\u2019s in CS offers an information security specialization, which will help you get your master\u2019s in cybersecurity faster (there is some overlap in the courses required for both), if that\u2019s what your interested in.\n\nAlso, IIT has a some kind of national certification for cyber security, so completing the program will likely be beneficial for a cyber security job interview.",

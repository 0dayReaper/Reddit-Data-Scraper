I'm a third-year student who commutes, and I opted-in to the U-pass system, nothing has appeared on my account, and it hasn't activated. It's getting costly to travel to class every day and back, I will be down $25 by the end of this week if this continues :((",

They sorta tried putting the blame on me even though there was no argument to begin with, I just wanted to see if they could activate my card since I opted-in a while ago. They also told me to call the number on the back of my card... That has never been part of the process for activating it nor for it to appear on my student account. I'm at a loss for words, thee old acaps email would have been far more helpful",

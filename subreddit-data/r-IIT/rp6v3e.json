    "postText": "So I know that for the Spring semester, the first 2 weeks of classes will be taking place completely online. But once that's over, I'll still have one class that takes place completely online and an in-person course ten minutes after that (at Siegel Hall) in my schedule. Also, I'm a commuter and it definitely takes me longer than ten minutes to get to campus from home. Does anyone have suggestions for good spots on Mies campus to take online classes?",

And if you\u2019re an ARCH student nobody would have a problem with you taking your online course during non studio hours in the studio!",

    "postText": "Hey I was wondering if anyone could provide some insight on RA living arrangement and situations. I\u2019m a law student at IIT Chicago-Kent interested in becoming a RA but as my school workload is demanding and I\u2019m a little older I\u2019d prefer a living arrangement that\u2019s more private and apartment style. \n\nDo RA\u2019s typically get their own room? Or is it more dependent on which dorm you get into? What would be the best dorm situation for an older student not really looking for the \u201ccollege-freshman\u201d environment?",

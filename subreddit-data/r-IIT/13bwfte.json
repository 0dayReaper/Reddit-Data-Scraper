    "postText": "Hope everyone's doing well!\nI had been admitted to IIT Chicago to do an MS in Finance. \nI'm an international student and my objective is to secure a job while I do the master.\nI don't know if IIT is very known or if it's worth going because I asked some of my friends from the US and nobody knew about IIT even if it's pretty decent ranked University in a lot of pages and for what I saw their Finance MS is ranked top 24th nationally.\nI'm waiting for DePaul and Marquette but I have to accept IIT before May 15th!\nCan anyone tell me if IIT Chicago is worth for Finance and for getting a job?! Finance MS is a STEM program so in theory I'm elegible for an OPT!\nThank you so much and hope you can help!",

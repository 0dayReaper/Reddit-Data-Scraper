The site is lackadaisical and lackluster--quite a bore really.\n\nThe five reasons are actually two--it's not blackboard and it's an online planner.  The market is exhausted with tried-and-failed products, and yours doesn't differentiate.\n\nWhy should I use this product over my planner and text messaging?  Was this an IPRO (ew)?\n\n/e\n\nI thought about it a bit more.  Relevance of koala?  None.\n\nColor scheme?  Bland.\n\nIdea?  Nothing new.\n\nFeatures?  Blackboard meets Facebook.\n\nIntegration ability?  I foresee none.\n\nIgnore the dickish comments and focus on the main goal of this project.  You present an alternative to the conventional planner, but why?  Is the planner broken?  Is your solution revolutionary in meeting deadlines?  This project needs to be reconsidered.\n\nBRING ON THE DOWNVOTES.\n\n/e\n\nObviously the downvoters have never been in an ipro.",

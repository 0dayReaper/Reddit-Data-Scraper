    "postText": "Hello, IIT friends! We've always enjoyed seeing so many of you at VandyHacks events in the past, so we wanted to make sure you know that we are back on **October 8th-10th** with a hybrid hackathon!\n\nIn addition to hacking, you will have the chance to network/potentially interview with companies like Asurion, IMC, Capital One, and more. We're also excited to host fireside chats with leaders like Quincy Larson, the founder of freeCodeCamp!\n\n**Register before October 3rd at 11:59pm CT at** [**vandyhacks.org**](https://vandyhacks.org/)! Come alone or with friends; there are plenty of opportunities to meet new teammates and learn \"How to Hack\" if you're a first-time hacker. Beginners and all majors are warmly welcomed as always. :)",

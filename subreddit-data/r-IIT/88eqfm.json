Definitely some issues with crime, there were quite a few muggings while was there, but public safety is always there to help out.  People are great and inclusive, while I was there I had a great time partying with people from Brazil, China, Americans( I am from India). almost 30 - 40% are international students(Mostly Indian and Chinese) so there is lots of diversity. Dorms are very comfortable and safe. The food is good, but the timings are really weird, the mess closes at 7 PM If I am not forgetting. There is a L station in the college which is very convenient and can take you to Downtown in 10 mins. So yeah solid B+. ",

The thing about crime in the city is that you just have to be aware of your surroundings, of course IIT is not in the best area of Chicago but it is definitely a better place than 50% of other areas. Im a Civil Engineering major so I cant say much about Computer Engineering but I know a lot of people who really enjoy it. ",

Some of the stuff you learn here is good but if depending on what your goals are, you will have to work your ass off (outside academics) to be successful. If you aspire to work at big companies after graduation, good luck because no top companies come recruit here. Some students do land jobs at big companies like Google etc but that is only because they are extremely smart or they worked their butt of during interviews. Having said that, being in Chicago is a huge plus and if you are willing to network - you can hit up the local tech scene for opportunities; but again, you'd have to do that outside academics. \n\nThe advisors are also hit or miss. Some advisors (like mine) do not answer their emails at all.  \n\nIf you plan on going to grad school after, you will have decent chances of being accepted if you do well in your classes here. There's also opportunities to do research so that's great if you want to go to grad school.  \n\nApart from that, I don't know, Iamsaltyingeneral.",

I wish the school was more academically rigorous, but really it's what you make of it. \n\n\nAll engineering majors I know, who decide to stick with engineering, are happy with IIT. It really is an engineering/architecture school, so you won't go wrong going to IIT. ",

Has the high internation student ratio been a great thing for you?\n\nI'm thinking of applying for the upcoming fall. It'd be nice to hear from a current student.",

Undergrad population of international students is about 20% but most of them live on campus, whereas most of the american students from around chicago live off campus. International population of graduate students is about 70%, and since most of them live on campus too, it looks like it is only attended by international students. \n\nMostly the students are from China, India, Korea, with some EU students in the graduate programs. Architechture and Engineering tends to attract most of the international crowd, though there are some international MBA and MPA students that attend stuart but live downtown. \n\nMy country of origin: India.

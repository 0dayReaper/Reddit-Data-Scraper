            "comment": "Hi you dm'ed me and I found your other post which has questions you'd like to have answered. I'll try to answer the best I can and I will probably throw a lot of things at you. I hope it won't be overwhelming!   \n\n\n \n\nI am an incoming freshman with the intention of majoring in mathematics (or applied mathematics).\n\n1. Could any math majors fill me in on what classes they have taken? This is a list of courses IIT has offered in the past several years, and will most likely be the structure of how courses are scheduled for the next few years:  [https://www.iit.edu/applied-math/student-resources/future-course-schedule](https://www.iit.edu/applied-math/student-resources/future-course-schedule) More details about specific courses can be found here:  [http://bulletin.iit.edu/undergraduate/courses/math/](http://bulletin.iit.edu/undergraduate/courses/math/) \n2. How are the classes in terms of difficulty and homework? Is the curriculum rigorous? Each class gives one problem set due each week. Intro courses aren't bad. After you start 300 level courses, it gets a lot harder. It is important to learn proof skills early on, in the first three semesters to succeed. \n3. Have any undergraduates taken graduate courses? Yes, regularly undergraduates take graduate courses. It is not difficult to ask for permission to take these courses. There is some overlap between graduate (500 level) and undergraduate (100-400) level courses. \n4. Any undergraduate research, if so, how did it go, what are you working on, etc.? Yes. I have had a wonderful experience as a research assistant, and I do get paid for the position. I do research in Computational Algebraic Geometry, specifically Groebner Bases. Not all research assistants get paid. I know only a couple of other undergraduate students doing research in AMATH, but this is not bad considering the department is small. There are summer research stipends for summer funding and other research programs you can participate in though these are with outside institutions, notably the REU program. I haven't published a paper yet at IIT, but hopefully soon.\n5. How is the applied part of the applied mathematics major going? How are those classes designed/structured? I don't enjoyed AMATH. I chose the wrong program for that reason. If you enjoy AMATH, IIT's math dept may be more rewarding for you. Figure out if you like the CS side or the Math side better. IIT's AMATH  primarily consists of five areas: discrete, statistical, stochastic, computational, and experimental. I'm not quite sure about the last one's presence in the dept, but the first four do have classes. The most numerous are statistics classes. Machine learning and data analysis are becoming bigger things, and we have a project-based course at IIT called MATH497 which incorporates these concepts. If you get enough students interested in a course, plus a professor who is willing to teach the course, you can make the course happen. \n6. What would you change about the math department at IIT and what is your favorite part about it?  \nI would personally want more \"pure\" courses at IIT. I think if you actually enjoy AMATH you will be happier here than I am. My favorite part about IIT's math dept is probably the handful of professors who I think are truly wonderful human beings. \n\nI hope you found this helpful!\n\nYou can message me again if you have more followup questions.",

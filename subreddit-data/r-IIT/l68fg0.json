Speaking with friends and colleagues, Purdue is a higher quality program but not by much, and Embry Riddle is a lower quality program but they have inroads with industry that will allow you to actually work in aerospace while in school. IIT has some great research opportunities if you make that a priority and they're pretty good about internship opportunities as well. Campus life is meh, but you're in a giant city with other colleges nearby if your want to expand your social reach. The coursework is going to be a long and difficult process but it will be worth it in the end.",

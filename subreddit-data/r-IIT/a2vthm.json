    "postText": "Hi , \n\nTo all the people in this sub Reddit , I am a student aspiring to pursue my masters in US(I'm from India).  There are a lot of consultancies here which charge a ridiculous amount of money to evaluate the profile of a candidate and try send them to a university which is somewhat of a lower reputation than the student can aim for.  I was planning on setting up a platform preferably a website or an app for students to connect with the current students of various colleges and get a realistic view of their profile and probably proof read their SoP for absolutely no charge.  I was wondering if anyone could volunteer . \n\nPls DM me if so. \n\nThanks .  ",

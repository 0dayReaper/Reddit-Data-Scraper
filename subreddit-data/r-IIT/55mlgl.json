Despite the \"collection of trivia\" approach taken by a lot of chemistry-for-the-masses courses, the heart of chemistry is: What's a universal rule I can deduce from a specific example?  Chemistry isn't so much about the trivia of lions going \"ger!\" as it is about a way of thinking about things.",

I know lots of people that just go and sit like all day and do their work and then when they have any questions, there's a tutor there to help them out. It's pretty neat. \n\nYou can come in basically any time today and there'll be a tutor. ",

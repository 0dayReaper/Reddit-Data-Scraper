    "postText": "I was looking to apply for a master's program that I thought looked interesting and based on my undergrad major. However, I was curious on the hybrid format. Would it be possible to take all online or in-person? Or is there a mandatory blend of both? I would appreciate any clarification, thank you.",

            "comment": "D41 is right about every department/professor handling online/hybrid/in-person differently. However, you should also be aware that the school will likely start removing remote learning options once the pandemic is beginning to slow. Not saying that will be soon, but I would factor the possibility of in-person only into your decision.",

            "comment": "If the class is marked as hybrid the option is yours if you want to go in person or take it online.  Professors should no be forcing you to go in person if the class is marked hybrid.  Some lectures I have seen are hybrid/virtual but the lab section is still in person. If the class is marked as virtual then it will be 100% online.  It dose seem like every department and professor is doing their own thing on what classes are hybrid, virtual, or not. Hope that clarifies your question.",

Hopefully it can be similar to UIUC, the master's civil program, where there is an online alternative for each course. Most of the classes, I would expect, would be lectures and could be online even when it is not during a pandemic.",

That would honestly give you a better idea on what is going on. I would assume most professors are not going to change for next semester and the school has not officially made any changes.",

I'd like to know how fast the wifi at the classroom is like. Does anyone know about this? Please let me know thank you!",

With so many people in one spot it sometimes can be less than desirable. I think what you are looking to do can be done I have done it before with my computer's but my desktop was plugged into Ethernet in a fraternity house which have much better Ethernet.  The WIFI in classrooms will be fine your issue will be more to do with the dorms.  What you are doing can be done but expect for it to sometimes struggle to work for no reason.",

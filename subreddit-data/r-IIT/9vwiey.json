    "postText": "I'm been accepted to IIT as a CS major undergrad student, and interested in the co-terminal data science program, internships/research opportunities, and perhaps an applied mathematics minor. However, I am also looking to continue pursuing dance both competitively and recreationally. Does Illinois Tech have many other hip hop/urban dancers? How busy should I expect to be with what I plan to do?",

            "comment": "Hey, I\u2019m a freshman from the CS department and I feel like the workload can be as heavy or as light as you want it to be. It all depends on how long you plan to graduate and/or how much time you want to socialize/have fun. So far I\u2019ve had a 17 credit hour semester and a 15 hour one and I can say that the work is definitely manageable and I\u2019ve also had ample time to go out and chill.  (The max number of hours you can take is 18 unless you get department permission to go higher) \n\nHowever your situation is clearly different since you plan on dancing competitively which I assume is going to take up a lot of your time. I know that it\u2019s doable since I\u2019ve seen the athletes here also manage a full course load but then still train/practice everyday.  \n\nIf you go on the IIT website you can actually find a list of student organizations and hopefully you\u2019ll see a dancing organization. I will say though that IIT is not known for their dance programs so if that is what you\u2019re looking for maybe it\u2019s a good idea to look at other schools as well! \n",

Sounds good, and I would be fine without a prestigious dance team, so I'll look at the different organizations off the website. \n\nSlightly related, how easy/hard is it for new students to get connected to things like research and internships or other extracurriculars? Also, what are some ways you prepared for IIT CS? ",

(I\u2019d say once every 2-3 weeks I would get an email from a local company looking for candidates for internships/part time jobs) \n\nAlmost all the professors at this school are doing some form of research project and I would estimate ~50% of them don\u2019t mind less experienced people like freshmen/sophomores helping them out. One example I can give is that when I had CS350 Professor Hale (really awesome professor by the way) actually looked for students to help him build a Doom-like game and help him with his post doctoral research in C etc. \n\nMy roommate (who was Chem Eng) also had a summer position lined up where he was running experiments in his professor\u2019s lab and actually helped publish the paper a couple of weeks ago if I\u2019m not mistaken. \n\nInternships on the other hand are much harder to get (just my personal experience as an \u201caverage level\u201d CS student). Most companies look for juniors or seniors who have some core classes (CS350, CS331, Calc 3 etc.) and a portfolio to back it up. People who manage to secure internships in their freshman or sophomore year usually have connections in the company, are VERY talented or network extremely successfully. However despite me saying this, IIT graduates have pretty good job security because the curriculum is of good quality, things are just harder because IIT doesn\u2019t carry the same weight as a name like MIT or UIUC. \n\nIn terms of prep I had about 3 years of experiencing programming in java but it is definitely not needed. There are introduction classes like CS100, CS115, CS116 or CS201 which do a pretty decent job of preparing you for what\u2019s to come. (although I will say nothing prepares you for CS350 and CS331. These two classes fucked me up and there\u2019s pretty much no way to prepare for it) ",

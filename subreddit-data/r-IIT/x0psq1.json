As part of this year's Homecoming, students and alumni are invited to participate in our first annual game jam event. Teams have 2 weeks to design their own game from scratch based on a prompt provided at our kickoff event. The jam begins on Thursday, Sept. 1 and ends with an in-person demo on Saturday, Sept. 17 during Homecoming, so sign up today. Join as a team or as an individual and be assigned to a team - no experience necessary. Prizes given to the most popular games!\n\n[Register here.](https://host.nxt.blackbaud.com/registration-form/?formId=9957724a-bd38-4f30-b564-ec0e5a441430&amp;envId=p-eedIiK9_DUuz9aUDcc2V6g)",

I would sleep most of the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst thing that would happen would be someone pissing and shitting in a car. That was pretty rare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes people would run shell games, also pretty rare.",

There\u2019s your fair share of people asking for money or just cars that smell like drugs.\n\nJust be cautious of your belongings. My ex got her wallet stolen during rush hour while people were going in and out of the car. Sitting on the front cars closest to the conductor is typically the safest place to sit.",

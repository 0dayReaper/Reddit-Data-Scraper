    "postText": "I\u2019m an international student. I got accepted to MSCS program for Fall 2022 at IIT Chicago and ASU Tempe. I received scholarship from both institutions. The tuition and living cost will be almost same for me at both these institutions. So, financing is not a concern at the moment.\n\nI looked into the curriculum, faculty and research at both departments\u2026 and liked them both. Now I\u2019m not sure what to choose. Hence, I want to know how these two institutions are viewed by recruiters. \n\nWhich one will be better? And which one will be better if I want to go for PhD after MS? Please share an opinion on this.\n\nThank you!",

The teaching is below average, no vision whatsoever. Buildings need maintenance but they don't get any. Very limited food options. Grad students are not paid enough to survive in Chicago. School has zero social life! It is depressing and miserable af here.",

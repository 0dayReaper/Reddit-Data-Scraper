(I couldn't find that information elsewhere) \n\n4) Is Vegetarian food easily available? \n\nThanks in advance! \n\nUpdate: I've paid my deposit and I will be entering in fall 2014! Thanks for all the answers ",

Find all of them early and arrange for substitution, exception or otherwise. bug the hell out of your adviser and if needed, your department head. Also, there's a difference between a professional masters and a masters of science. this will be part of it too. \n\n2)yup. you'll never use it for anything good though. \n\n3)Job placement is alright but don't expect to be rolling in  the dough right out of the gate. Entry level engineer salaries start 40k and average at 58k. within 5 years expect about 60-70k. \n\n4)Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten Free are all available basically at all on campus eateries. ",

But you said you have credits (hopefully they transfer) so that might take a year off or at least make each semester less stressful.\n\n2) iPads: I'm pretty sure (iPad mini were given out Fall 2013).\n\n3) Engineering in general will guarantee you a job right after graduation. Pay will star low but get higher. Interviews for internships are important.\n\n4) Yes, the Commons has a vegetarian section. (vegan, salad bar). A good variety.",

It took awhile for me to find out about this as the original co-terminal was just a professional masters.\n\nFinishing in 4 years: It would depend if you did the thesis option or non-thesis option. Thesis option you would not be able to finish in 4 years. Non-thesis option, since it is just course work you may be able to finish in 4 years with credit coming in, and taking classes over the summer. I would recommend taking the full 5 years and use your summers to do internships. Internships will help out a lot more than just finishing school quick. \n\nAs for job placement for ECE, it depends what you want to do. If you want to be a software engineer then great! The career fair is heavily focused towards programming jobs. For me, I am doing computer hardware and never got a job through my school connections. Your experience may be different. \n\nI got a job and the starting salary didn't seem to be influenced by going to IIT. It had more to do with location, the degree (MS vs BS) and the companies average starting salary for a specific job. Look on glassdoor.com for starting salaries for job positions or company. However, IIT does have some statistics out there for starting pay and mid-career salary and they are good.\n\nEdit: Google \"iit median pay ranking\" and the first couple links all have statistics on salaries. \n",

I started by looking at top companies in my field, and then eventually through lots of Google searches I found smaller companies. \n\nMy final internship I got just by applying online. This last one was as a hardware engineer.

I haven't have that experience at all. Even doing a co-terminal degree I have found plenty of time to hang out with friends, explore Chicago, and other typical college activities (although not anywhere close to what a State school would offer). All while maintaining a high GPA, all it takes is some time management skills. \n \n* School Experience: My Junior year I started questioning if I went to the right school since I had spent 3 summers as a power engineer intern and could not break into the microelectronics industry. I talked with friends at more prestigious/bigger/better schools and they were all having the same problems, so it didn't have much to do with school but the job market, it is so competitive that it is really hard to get into.\n\n     Things started to turn around once I took a special problems course (an individual one-on-one class with a professor, highly recommended once you get into higher level classes) where I started diving into design and testing. I started putting this on my resume instead of my previous internships and it started to get a lot more attention. \n\n\n* TLDR: Overall good experience, but had it's ups and downs. \n       \n      ",

All in all, I'd say it was worth it, and not much more difficult than most of my friend's 4 years.\n\nThe school \"helped\" me look for jobs, ultimately it felt like that was a huge time sink, though. I wound up getting a job at the school through social connections, and not through the school, so, I think that should speak volumes about how good the school is at helping you look for jobs. Looking back on it, the one thing I wish I had done better was make social connections. That is the single best way to get jobs.",

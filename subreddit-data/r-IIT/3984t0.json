Ultimately I'm interested in becoming a DBA or doing something related to that. I'm looking at IIT, Loyola, and DePaul. Can you tell me why IIT would be my best choice?",

When I move on to a Bachelors program I'd rather spend more for a good quality education. It's an investment, I feel.\n\nI was told that with my GPA I should be eligible for some scholarships that I wouldn't be at IIT that I wouldn't be at the other two..",

Get involved. Go to startup events and hackathons. Those will help a lot.\n\nBut looking objectively I don't know the level of Loyola or Depaul's CS program. Illinois Tech's is good and i know many people who have gotten jobs but the rising costs of tuition I would highly recommend trying to go somewhere that won't cost a lot. ",

The Green line and the Metra Rock Island line run through campus as does many bus routes. There are also bike paths going into campus as well. \n\nI can tell you that I enjoyed living on campus and that I felt I grew the most by not living at home with my parents. \n\nAs for IIT, I loved my time there and got a great education. However I did not take any database classes so I can't really comment there. In general IIT CS classes are not straight programming classes as they use math and science in the form of algorithms and optimization a lot.",

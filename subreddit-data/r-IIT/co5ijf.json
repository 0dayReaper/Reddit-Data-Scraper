            "comment": "Any on-campus job is going to be tough for a commuter.  \n\nComputer lab stuff is usually pretty low key.  Manage printers, help people who can't log in, etc.  \n\nWhen I was a student I worked for the Campus Conference Center doing event setup.  You'll start as just productions staff setting up chairs and tables, etc.  After a bit you might become a building manager and be in charge of the events during a shift.  You work in 3 buildings primarily (the HUB, MTCC, chapel).  It can be a bit more physically demanding but it's pretty easy for the most part and at least when I was there the admin staff were all great and understanding when it came to scheduling.",

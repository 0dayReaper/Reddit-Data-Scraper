    "postText": "I've found some info about undergraduate experience at IIT but very little about graduate experience. \nYou know expectations of undergraduate students is not the same as Graduate students.\nI don't care much about partying or joining clubs and social activities. \nI care about the faculty (Reviews show it's terrible experience), about the campus facilities (also not so good) I mean enough places to relax, focus and be motivated to study ?\nAny advise on housing for a family of three cheaper than 1k?\nIs the program of information technology Worth it? Competitive? I'm a International student from a latin American country though.",

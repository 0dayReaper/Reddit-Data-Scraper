And do you think it's a good idea to take loan? I will be majoring in MechE if I join iit. (International student)\n\n(Will I get fin aid after I submit my financial affidavit?)",

Maybe it's changed, but when I was admitted IIT was very generous with giving out scholarships. That is, if you were a good student and deserving of a scholarship.\n\nHowever, it may be different for international students. Not really sure on their aid situation.",

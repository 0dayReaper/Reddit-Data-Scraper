Or have you heard what students think of the program? \n\nHow does everyone like Chicago? I'd really like to get a student's perspective about the campus, area, school in general if anyone feels like discussing it with me. \n\nThanks so much!\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all of the information! I really appreciate you all responding. I'm stoked to come see the campus and travel Chicago. I still haven't heard anything directly from a Design graduate student if there are any of you out there :)",

Not as crowded as NY or LA, and there's tons of things to do, places to eat, things to see, etc. There might not be as many stars in Chicago, and there really isn't a major fashion vibe like you get from NY, and there's a bunch of little nuances with the city, but all in all, it's great. Though, you'd probably hear the same thing from someone from LA or NY about how great their city is. You'd best visit all three to decide, but my experience has proved Chicago the best.",

A couple people have mentioned the crime rate (though I think every city could have that comment made). Any thoughts on this? Crime on campus, etc?",

There's also two police stations nearby, including one of the main headquarters for the City PD.  There are problems occasionally, almost always from locals as opposed to other students.  But as long as you pay attention to your surroundings and travel with people at night, you'll be perfectly okay.  I've lived in a few different places off-campus, and never had any problems while biking back and forth.  Bridgeport is a nice neighborhood to the West.  \n\nYou should visit the city to see if you like the feel of it.  The parks are great, there are tons of different places to eat and things to do.  The people can be friendly or a bit cold-shouldered, depends on the day.  Chicagoans are a proud bunch, so if you insult them, don't expect it to be taken lightly.  \n\nI'd be happy to answer any other questions you have.  ",

I know that the design program is very well regarded and have no idea what the world thinks of the business school. Granted I never had much contact with either of the two so not sure how helpful that is. I will also second that Chicago is the best city in the US. Totally worth a visit, if not an extended graduate stay.",

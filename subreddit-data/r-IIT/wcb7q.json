Safe now, but watch out for that\"\n\nIIT alert is for threats, not incidents. They aren't there to report, hey, someone got robbed. They're there to report there is a chemical spill, stay the hell out of E1 or there's a dangerous person on campus barricading themselves in a building, etc... The correct response is for IIT to send out an email acknowledging the incident. There's still some time for that to happen. ",

Rather, why don't you focus on the fact that it happened ON campus, on 33rd and State, the center of IIT?\n\nI don't understand the implications of condescension, or the reason why you decided to write your major and graduation class, but the fact that something of this extent--two men, a man with a machete and his accomplice--occurred on our (read: YOUR) campus and there were little to no preventive measures.\n\nAlso, I'd like to point out that this week was ORIENTATION for the freshmen class.  I'm sure you understand the implications of that.",

I was not being condescending, but rather trying to show that there are a lot of things to think about once you get past this happening to begin with. I don't agree with the fact that students weren't notified, but do we even know why they weren't?\n\nDownvoting implies that my comment didn't add to the conversation.",

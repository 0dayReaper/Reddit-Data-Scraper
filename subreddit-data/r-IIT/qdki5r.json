Will it be refreshed next month for 2022 - 2024?\n2. I haven't seen anything regarding wifi. What and how do one register for wifi/ internet connection in the residencr hall? \n3. What are the long term vacations in which I can visit my home country? \n4. Where do I get the hawk ID from? \n\nRegarding SOAR, it is also not showing for January sessions.",

You dont need to register.\n\n3. summer, and winter. you can see the IIT schedule online, but its about 6 weeks for winter break and like 10-12 (?) weeks for summer.\nthere is also a week for spring break and about a week for thanksgiving.\n\n4. after uploading a portrait, an physical card will be produced at the start of the semester, and you will be able to pick it up from ACAPS in Herman Hall. orientation will go over how to do all this.",

In the web page, it is said that I also have to purchase iit insurance from a website called Aetna but I can't seem to find any place where I can purchase anything",

I'm not an international student so there may be more you need to show them but I do know the school wants a record of immunizations and stuff at least.\n\nEventually, you will get an email from the school telling you want they need. Thats generally true for everything - they email about covid vax proof, health insurance, hawk ID, etc. There's very little that you need to \"figure out\" on your own, so I would just say don't worry too much and just wait to be contacted.",

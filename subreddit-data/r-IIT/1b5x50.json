Thanks everyone for their input.",

            "comment": "I'm a bit older, graduated with a CS degree in '02 but I think this story is still relevant: When my first boss hired me (in the middle of the dot-com &amp; post-9/11 recession) he told me it was because I went to IIT and it made me stand out from other candidates. IIT might not be MIT or Caltech, but an IIT degree holds a lot of weight, especially in the midwest. \n\nCampus life is a harder sell. IIT is a tough school, classes can be hard and you can get a lot of homework. IIT used to show up near the bottom in lists of party schools. The male to female ratio is skewed, and everyone's nerdy to some degree which stunts social interaction. However, there are plenty of groups/activities/communities to get involved in, and you're in the city of Chicago, which is one of the best in the world. 10-11 years later and I still talk to and hang out with friends I made at IIT. If you make a point to get off campus and enjoy city life and make friends from other colleges (Loyola, DePaul, UIC, etc) you can have a great time. A lot of IIT kids spent all their time in their dorm room which I always felt was a waste. \n\nIn short, if you're willing to put in the work, IIT will reward you. If you want to party or you're not up to working hard and earning a fairly tough degree, you might want to look elsewhere.",

There are a lot of opportunities for internships and job opportunities after college here too. The key is to get to know professors. You can do this through office hours or joining a club like the SAE electric car club and getting to know the club advisors. They will write letter of recommendations or recommend you to other employers if you earn their respect.",

            "comment": "I graduated with a CS degree in '09 and I'm currently a Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech doing computer security research. Honestly, I hated on IIT a lot while I was there and after, but there are some undeniably good things about it:\n\n* Even the terrible CS students got jobs when they graduated. No idea how, but it's true.\n* The good ones got _good_ jobs and I have friends making $100k+ 3-5 years after graduation. The CS program is pretty decent and my eng friends seem to have performed similarly well.\n* Chicago rules. Great music scene, great bar scene, gorgeous summers. IIT gives you unlimited travel on the CTA and it goes just about everywhere.\n* People in Chicago tend to know and love IIT grads. I believe this is true for neighboring states as well.\n\nIf you plan on going to graduate school, IIT was mostly a strike against me since my competing applicants were coming from places like Berkeley/MIT/etc. However, due to the school being small, it's easier to get involved in research as an undergrad which _will_ make you stand out when applying to PhD programs. My research experience at IIT got me a research gig at Berkeley, which in turn got me a publication, which made getting accepted to GT and other similar schools way easier. I felt a little bit behind my cohort in some areas due to lack of coverage in undergraduate (in CS this was mostly architecture-y stuff like pipelining), but I'd say I was mostly prepared.\n\nSome tips to stay sane:\n\n* Make friends at: columbia college and loyola (mostly if you are a guy. pretty much the opposite guy-girl ratio, and a larger proportion of the guys are gay if that's your particular orientation)\n* Similar to the above, the architecture department is rock solid at IIT and the people tend to be more--ahem--social.\n* Leave your dorm door open. Don't play WoW all day. Someone on my dorm floor my first year dropped out (I think) because of an addiction to free EverQuest servers. Don't be that guy.\n* Live in Bridgeport asap. Bridgeport is probably one of the coolest neighborhoods in Chicago _right_ _now_. Take advantage.\n* The administration is largely dysfunctional, but it's mostly due to understaffing (at least when I was there). Make sure your financial aid is correct every semester and don't slip through the cracks.",

Damn.\nI graduated with ynadji and everything he speaks is true. \n\nThe worst part of IIT, to me, was the amount of WOW playing that occurred and how hard it was to rip people away from their 'raid party'. Because of the social life and feeling like I missed out on certain experiences, I sometimes wish I would have gone to UIUC. Then I remember some of the great friends I did take away from the experience and living in the city for four years, it doesn't seem like it was that terrible.\n\nSo IIT wasn't that bad, but you have to try pretty hard to have good experience.",

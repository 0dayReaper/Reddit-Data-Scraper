The research done here is also extremely applied. I only know of two profs in the CS dept who work in theory. More than that, you get the Chicago experience and the proximity to the city lets u get startup jobs easier than universities like uiuc. The name recognition is a problem tho. Really creeps up on u but like I said if you know ur shit and learn ur shit, u can make a very good career out of it.",

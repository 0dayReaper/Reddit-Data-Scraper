            "comment": "So usually yes you can choose your roommate and usually you get to set a preference on which residence hall you want to live in. Everything is up in the air at the moment with the whole COVID situation.  What happened this fall was that they allowed students to do all classes online and from home if they wished (waivering the living on campus two years policy). They also gave the option to live on campus with a single room (at no extra cost) or with a roommate for the same price. I am unsure if they will offer the single room option next fall because im pretty sure they removed it for Spring 2021.",

There are single gender floors, bigender floors and gender neutral floors to choose from in all of the dorms, more or less.",

            "comment": "In a typical year IIT requires that freshman spend their first 2 years living in a dorm. The only exception is if you live within a specific distance from school or move out into Greek Life. Dorming alone happens if the school has the availability or if you have a medical accommodation. If you get a double room as a single you will have to pay for that other person that is not there. When you sign up for housing you can select a preferred dorm but is not guaranteed. On that form you can also request a specific roommate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou might also find some information here: [https://web.iit.edu/housing/returning-residents-selection](https://web.iit.edu/housing/returning-residents-selection)\n\nLast year's pricing chart: [https://web.iit.edu/sites/web/files/departments/onestop/pdfs/2019-2021%20Room%20Rate%20Sheet.pdf](https://web.iit.edu/sites/web/files/departments/onestop/pdfs/2019-2021%20Room%20Rate%20Sheet.pdf)",

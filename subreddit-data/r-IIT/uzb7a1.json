    "postText": "Is there a specific app or website that you guys use to sell textbooks after a semester is over? I have a few books that I bought from Amazon and have no use for anymore. I also have a couple books that I bought from the IIT bookstore, and I heard that it used to be an option to sell books back to them. I asked about that recently, and it seems like they don't allow that anymore. Any suggestions?",

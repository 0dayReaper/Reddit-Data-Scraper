            "comment": "I am not trans or anything but I know probably over a dozen trans classmates, mainly from clubs - PRISM is the lgbtq+ club on campus, a LOT of great people there, then there's plenty of lgbtq people (over 60% of active members) in illinois tech robotics club for example, almost every club and person is super cool with the lgbtq+ community. IIT's population is pretty... gay tbh. I heard a statistic somewhere that i have **no factual backing for** but honestly it kinda checks out - apparently (as of a few years ago) 40% of IIT students who identify as female also identify as part of the lgbtq+ community. You will very easily find friends, who are trans or gay or just really good allies, without even looking. I can personally name 3 first year comp sci trans students for example. And a few second years, and third years, and I know a 5th year... that's just in CS, and just people that I, a cis male, personally know.\n\nThere's definitely people who are... disrespectful to say the least, but I've at most encountered a nasty sign in a dorm window (that got taken down) or there's this one weird club that's pro-guns and other stuff that nobody really likes or supports. \n\nThere's always annoyances and BS with getting your name/gender changed in IIT's system (and most systems, I'm sure you're aware) and stuff, so *ideally* that should already be done before you even apply (they create an account for you the moment you are accepted). Though, its not like its impossible, I've seen names get changed in even the most obscure places at the school so YMMV.\n\nIf you'd like, I can point you to some trans people you can talk to who can give you better insight, could probably even get a zoom or discord call with someone.",

            "comment": "I was closeted/questioning most of my time there and came out during my senior year - also a trans girl CS grad. The school has  amazing LGBTQ+ representation and I never had any issues, even from my roommates, at least one of whom was relatively conservative at the time I came out. Prism is great, and there's representation in basically every student org too. I was in Illinois Tech Robotics and by the time I graduated maybe 25% of the members were queer in some way. For all its issues - the food kinda sucked, and the administration could be a pain to work with sometimes - I really enjoyed my time there. \n\nThe campus is nice, kind of a green oasis in the city - some of the buildings are really old and run down, but others are nice and new. Never really had any safety concerns. There's easy access to downtown with the Green and Red lines a very short walk away, and a ton of bus routes that go through campus. If you're there over the summer, there's a public beach a couple of blocks away too. If you like bikes, the lakefront trail is there as well and the city's bike share program offers a steep discount for students.\n\nIf you want to do a Discord call or something you're welcome to reach out via DM\n\nEdit: was just told that Illinois Tech Robotics is much much gayer now, like I think only one maybe 2 members of the executive board are cis/het",

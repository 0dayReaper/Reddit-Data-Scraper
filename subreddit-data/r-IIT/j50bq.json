            "comment": "Miller's Pizza Co, at 31st and State, in the same plaza as Jimmy John's, is really delicious.  If you ever get a chance to hit up the Pritzker club in MTCC, go for that.  It's incredibly delicious, and I believe they have some sort of Friday lunch deal goin' on.\n\nI know it might be farther than ten minutes, but if you've got a car, head over to 35th and Archer.  The Archview Diner is a fantastic place that's open 24/7.\n\nFor cheap and not quite as healthy, check out.. I think it's called Maxwell Street? at 31st and Canal.  I only know it as \"Ghetto Dog.\" \n\n31st and Morgan gives you the Bridgeport Coffee House, and it is about five to ten minutes out by bike.\n\nIf you're more into bars, there are three that are new within the past couple of years:\n\n* Rocky's is at 31st and Wells, just over the Dan Ryan.  I went there with a group of friends a couple years ago a few months after they opened.  The owner and the bar tender that night were incredibly friendly people.  I think we were able to get them to start taking out ads in TechNews.\n\n* Turtle's just opened up at Wells and 33rd, but I have not been there yet.  They did draw a huge crowd from Cork &amp; Kerry, though, which opened up maybe a year ago, now.\n\n* Cork &amp; Kerry is at 33rd and Princeton, practically right next door to Turtle's.  I have been here only once, but it had a nice atmosphere and friendly servers.\n\nThere are a ton of Chinese delivery places, but you'll be inundated by their menus if you live in the dorms.\n\nI have heard great things about Franco's at 31st and Princeton.  Freddie's Pizza and Pancho's Pistolas, both at 31st and Union, are fantastic places to eat.  Pancho's is currently my favorite, cheaper, Mexican restaurant.\n\nI've also heard great things about Nana's at Halsted and 33rd, but I have not been there yet.  I think they used to be breakfast only, but then slowly expanded into Lunch and now Dinner.\n\nThose are the only places I can think of off the top of my head.  There are probably a lot of other, little, awesome places floating around here, too.",

Its good for special occasions or taking parents who are concerned that you live in a bad neighborhood. There are a bunch of other good places up and down Halsted, its a bit of a hike to get out there for a quick bite but there's a lot of options.\n\nI can't actually remember the name but there is a grocery store in the middle of Brigdeport that sells awesome sandwiches and locally produced pop. I want to say its Uncle Jonny's Grocery at 32nd and Normal but I only discovered it the week I left the city so that might be wrong. Also if you do go to that area save yourself the time of wonder if First Base is a good bar, its not. That's about all I can think of beyond what you listed.",

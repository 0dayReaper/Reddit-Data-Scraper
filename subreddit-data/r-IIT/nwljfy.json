I wish to know some good places around the college where I could find a room.\n\nAlso, what would be some good apps other than Air Bnb to find places to stay at?",

There are a couple apartments directly south across the street from IIT, those couple blocks of apartments are good, I just moved out of one three weeks ago. It's like 800 for a room and a large apartment that you'd share with someone else (I know our neighbor was a teacher and he had two rooms open in his unit).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be looking at Bridgeport. They have lots of student apartments and are cheaper. Check out zillow and other apartment apps.",

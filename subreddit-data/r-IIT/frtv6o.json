One thing I did notice when I compare IIT CS professors to WPI/Rose is that they seem to come from prestigious ivy schools with education and experience from there at IIT. I am hoping that should be good news for IIT. But don't know if that is translating to benefits for students.",

            "comment": "**1) Why is IIT ranked so high in this list for Professors Get Low Marks, least happy students. How is quality of Computer Science professors? Can someone clarify**  \nThese metrics are based off of several factors such as Graduation rate, GPA, number of students employed after graduation. Trust me, the professors are horrible and you'll definitely have several hard lows at IIT because of their attitude towards their discipline. Most professors at IIT are doing research as their main gig and teaching because that's what PhD candidates have to do. So you'll be getting a teaching level from people that usually will be pointing at the slideshows more than anything else, and that can be tough and boring. I am **not** saying that all professors are like that, but in my 4 (9 semesters) years at IIT, I've only had 2 professors that really got my attention in class. That differs from people to people tho.  \n\n\n**2. How easy it is to get access to professors for individual appointment on regular basis for things like tutorial. How long do you have to wait?**  \nYou definitely have a lot of resources, from Office hours, TA Office hours, the Academic Resource Center (ARC). It is easy, and most professors' office hours are walk-in, unless they specify that you need to set an appointment for it. Usually, this question is not really an issue.  \n\n\n**3. Do you have situation where some professors are not good and you have to look for tutors outside of school?**  \nThis is going to be your main issue at IIT. 90% of the times, we have to rely on websites like Chegg, or the Academic Resource Center (who do a really good job most of the times). Ideally, you'll form a friend group out of frustration for that class, and you'll end up studying together at the library.   \n\n\n**4. Do you have challenge with registering for courses that you are interested especially during Freshman, Sophmore years for high demand classes?**  \nYes, but this is generally a problem at every school. If a class of 100 students will have a demand of 200, IIT usually creates a second class session. In my experience, I've been on waitlists only for humanities classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reason why IIT is in our top list is because of the CS curriculum which seems to have interesting and latest up to date developments in CS field though IIT is less known/branded compared to WPI, Rose Hulman etc..**  \nIIT has also announced that they are started the College of Computer Science. So that has the opportunity to become something great.   \n\n\nGood luck with your college application, and if you choose IIT, I hope you have a great time in Chicago. Stay safe, and don't hesitate to throw questions",

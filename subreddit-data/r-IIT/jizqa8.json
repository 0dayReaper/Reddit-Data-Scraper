    "postText": "I am an undergradute student at IIT and I want to start doing some research. However, after navigating through the IIT website, I was soon overwhelmed by the amount of different research opportunities that the university has. Elevate, funded research, engineering themes, armour r&amp;d: MIND and PURE, research institutes, and faculty reasearch were all of the many different options available to undergraduate students.\n\nI am having trouble deciding which one to apply for, however, I would like to work for a faculty member and help him/her out with their research. I would like to apply for an undergraduate research assistant position, but I don't know who should I contact/approach for this? I also wanted to know if the faculty members ask for other records: experience, major, gpa and etc. when considering a student to do research under them.\n\nI do not want to participate in research that requires funding from my own pocket, but would rather be inclined to work as a volunteer or get a paid position if possible.\n\nCan anyone explain to me how the process works?",

Find a professor that they think is doing interesting research and then contacting that professor about it. Each professor is looking for something different when selecting research assistants. It also depends on the research on if they can have them or not. Hope this helped.",

I did two semesters of research at IIT as an undergrad and used them to substitute for a class I couldn't fit into my schedule. Professor Nash in the MMAE department he had me assist a visiting professor in the materials lab, researching magnetic coercivity in steel. I essentially just ran a bunch of materials tests and analysed data at his direction. The result of the course is usually a research paper for each semester although your professor may have a different arrangement. Not a bad experience",

            "comment": "I was part of the PURE program last year. Both PURE and MIND are part of Armour R&amp;D.  Elevate is it's own program separate from the two above.\n\nA professor directly reached out to me about an opportunity. If you don't feel comfortable asking a professor you like directly, you can also seek information from your advisor, or the department chair. I don't believe you can apply for PURE or MIND without a faculty sponsor. Both programs are only a semester long afaik.  \n\n\nTypically you will get paid a small stipend, \\~$500ish for the semester. They will likely look at a resume, your GPA, and how far along you are in the undergraduate program. It is *unlikely* you get a research opportunity if you are not a Junior or Senior by credits, and have lower than a 3.0. Typically major only matters to the faculty member who's sponsoring the research. At the end of the program you submit a short scholarly article (1-2 Pages) and present your work at the Undergraduate Research Expo. Last year's was virtual, but you had to design and submit a poster.",

Though, what would you say is the process for getting an undergraduate research assistant position, and working for a faculty who is also conducting a research (doesn't matter if it'spaid or unpaid)? Is it similar to this?",

(I finished undergrad in Spring '20, and am currently a Master's student here.) There really aren't enough opportunities avalible to support that; Graduate students have a hard time getting that kind of position/funding.",

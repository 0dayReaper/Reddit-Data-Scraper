Being a junior from UIUC, there's a lot of things about UIUC that I wish I knew as a freshman but that kind of advice isn't very helpful. What's something you know now, that you wish you knew your freshmen year?\n\nEdit: Also should mention, he got accepted into Computer Science",

It really is the single best way to meet people and get information about everything.\n\nThe other dorms on campus are nice for once you have made friends, but people who lived in the SSV dorms their first year don't really meet many people because they don't really see anyone for that first crucial week before classes start.\n\nAlso, we you get to know a lot of people it is pretty easy to ask around for help and information for pretty much everything. I don't know how I would have gotten through my first semester without that community of people living with me.",

            "comment": "Have an open mind about the fraternities on campus. Fraternities at IIT are nothing like fraternities at other schools. The fraternities have a focus on education and also building leadership. Yes they party at times and have fun, but they also recognize they are at school to learn and focus on  learning. I would help younger members with their homework. Many people would study together in the common areas of the house. \n\nI learned so much about leadership by living in the fraternity. You learn what works and doesn't work just by watching others as they grow into their roles. Than when you get the chance you make mistakes and learn from them. Now that I'm working in the real world I can see new leaders that haven't learned the lessons I did i  college, and watch them struggle. I've gotten great reviews from management as I've been able to take control and manage various situations without needing management's help. \n\n\nThe other thing I would recommend is getting a part time job on campus. If your brother qualifies for federal work study he should be able to easily get a job. Work for the campus and conference centers setting up and breaking down events. As he gains experience he can transition into managing the building and events. You learn great interpersonal interaction skills from this job. \n\nOther jobs available are working at the rec center. When I worked there I would do homework for a couple hours while managing the register and then play pool for the last couple hours of work. \n\nVarious departments also hire students to do office work. \n\nAs for the CS department, it was OK, not anything special. I was Computer Engineering and I took most of the CS core classes. I was always able to finish the final projects but there were many of the CS majors that couldn't get them to work. \n",

                    "comment": "This is pretty good advice and it's the route I happened to take during my time at IIT a few years back - fraternity life and campus job. If I had to tell my freshman self what direction to go with my time at IIT, I would definitely reinforce those two.\n\nA few more thoughts to add:\n\n- I found my time in a fraternity to be a comfortable and educational middle step between being a an inept teen and becoming a functioning adult. It's like being handed part of a manual on how to be an adult and practicing lessons from it. You instantly gain a house of roommates and friends. You then learn how to sort out your emotions in dealing with these new roommates/friends. Your living quarters will be both be better and weirder than the dorms. You do chores and learn how to fix things around the house. You get fed better than you do at the Commons (usually) and you have a full kitchen to try your hand at cooking on the weekends. If you fail and reach out, someone will help. If you are being a terrible person, someone will call you out on it. All of this while gaining great stories and only embarrassing yourself to handful of people.\n\n- I think more valuable than life and leadership skills is the fraternity's ability to provide job connections. Your brothers and alumni will no doubt work in the industry and your personal relationship with them with be of greater value to an employer than some Joe Shmoe fresh off the street with a degree and nothing else.\n\n- Your brother will ultimately have to decide for himself whether he wants to be part of a fraternity or not. I would recommend being open-minded and attending some of the rush events that happen in the first week. He would be an idiot not to go just to meet other freshmen eager to make friends. It gets somewhat tougher to do after classes start.\n\n- If he can get an on campus job, absolutely do it. I too happened to work for CCC, but I found it to be a bit too backbreaking and unrewarding at times, though I have learned a great deal about AV equipment and you get the power of handling keys to buildings and expensive equipment. I would instead recommend getting a door guard, welcome desk or rec desk position, because you get paid to sit there and do homework and you don't have to rely on your fellow student coworkers as much.\n\n- I too was a CpE (as well as EE) and took some CS classes. I found the professors to be a lot better than what I had to endure in EE, so I personally think compared to other departments, CS has some really cool staff.",

            "comment": "The fraternities are often cheaper than regular housing and offer a way to make more friends.  There isn't any hazing or much partying.  Just think of them as alternative housing.  A difference is that in the frats you'll have to do a chore every night to keep the place clean since there are no janitors.  But you get a lot more in return for your work, like your own room, lower costs, often better food, and additional friends.  Really look into it with an open mind.\n\nKnow that campus is much more active in the fall than the spring.  In spring people tend to focus more on summer jobs and don't care about campus activities as much.\n\nFor fun, be a tourist of Chicago.  Just do touristy things even if you're from around here.  Like go to museums, zoos, look out from the Sears Tower.  Oh and try all the food.  Especially China town cause it's only one L stop away, which is super close.\n\nWhen I was new here I didn't know what to do with my time, or how to find out about things to do.  I suggest just getting up and going to workout at the gym.  Introduce yourself to people on your dorm floor and be tourists.  Let yourself get rushed by the frats (they have all sorts of events), they won't be mad if you ever say no to joining.",

            "comment": "* join a frat if that's your thing. Great community\n* live in the dorms your first year. Someone already mentioned it, but choose MSV\n* academic resource center = good free tutoring\n* hit the gym, for. real.\n* take good notes, and rewrite them and rewrite some more.\n* get to know at least 2 people in your class just in case you miss lecture for some reason.\n* read the syllabus, it is the instruction pamphlet to succeed\n* make yourself known to the professor. I always thought this was beneficial. Professors are humans. Making easy conversation before lecture, just asking them how their day is going or something. \n\nGood luck! IIT is pretty cool :)\n",

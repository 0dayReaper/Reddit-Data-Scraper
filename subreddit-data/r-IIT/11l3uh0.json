    "postText": "Hello! I'm currently a freshman in high school and I live around an hour away. I've heard of other people having success emailing professors for research opportunities over the summer. \r\n\r\nIt's pretty early but I think it would be great for me to experience it as I'm considering a career in STEM! I've always been a tech guy so I think CS/Engineering is a possibility for me (I was able to get a good science recommendation and will be taking Intro to CS over summer and AP CSA early next year). I have little experience but I'm beginning to learn on my own and willing to put in the effort! \r\n\r\nAlso, I find STEM in general interesting so any research opportunity would be great for me to explore. How should I go about emailing these professors? (Also, is this the right month to email them or am I doing this too late?)\r\n\r\nThanks!",

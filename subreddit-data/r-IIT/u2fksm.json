    "postText": "Hi, I am a high school senior strongly considering attending IIT for undergrad. I was wondering how safe the general area is and whether you would recommend living in a place like Rowe Village or commuting directly from an apartment in The Loop or within the Chicago suburbs? I was also just wondering how safe the Rowe Village area is? ",

            "comment": "Rowe Village is not being offered as a housing option to incoming freshman next year; only Kacek and Cunningham.  You should look into the school's on campus living requirements before pursuing an off campus apartment.  I think that they require to years on campus unless you will commute less than 20 miles from an existing residence. \n\nA large number of the students will be staying in those dorms next year so foot traffic should be fairly high and safe.  The center of campus and west (Armour Square and Bridgeport) are fairly safe as well.  East of Michigan Ave. and south of 35th Street can be dicey, especially in the evening.",

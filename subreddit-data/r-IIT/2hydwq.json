    "postText": "I got a bachelor's in history a couple years back. To make a long story short, I am now interested in pursuing an MS in Computer Science, possibly at IIT - is there anyone on this sub who has completed this degree from a non-traditional background who could offer advice? Specifically regarding funding but also regarding how difficult the program was coming from a non-CS background. Taking pre-reqs over the next year. ",

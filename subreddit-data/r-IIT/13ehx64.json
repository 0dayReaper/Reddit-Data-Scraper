If you cannot visit because you are international student, avoid IIT. \nIn many cases undergraduate curricula across schools in the US is similar and there is nothing remarkable about it at one school or another. On the other hand it is way more more important to develop social acumen and make good friends, especially if you did not acquire these skills earlier. This also applies if you are introverted and/or if you are from outside of the country where cultural norms that govern social interactions are different. It is way easier to accomplish all of this when you are in school with large student population and good social environment compared to small school with large international population and skewed gender ratio. \n\nOn the other hand, I think IIT is worth considering if you are want to do architecture.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.",

While IIT might not be as good of a school socially when compared to FSU, I still think it's what you make out of it, and Chicago is quite diverse with many people to meet at the end of the day.\n\n If you get the chance to go to IIT for a STEM program and are willing to put in the work, you will receive a great education.\n\nIn my opinion as a CS and AI major, our university is  underrated, classes are challenging and assignments seem to never end, but the effort is more than worth it at the end of the day.",

Their difficulty level is mediocre. You can verify it by taking any course at IIT and compare it to analogue course from tier 1 or tier 2 school. \n \n&gt;everyone I know is getting internships or full time positions (the salaries are quite good from what I've heard). \n\nAnd so students from any other school of similar caliber.

In fact, the college itself has more of a high school and in general  just has a glum feel. I personally didn't have a great experience there. College anywhere is what you make of it. The curriculum will be the same type of courses no matter where you study within the states. If you do well and understand concepts in the courses then you will get opportunities. At the end of the day, where you go doesn't matter. It's the skill that matters. In interviews, they won't ask why you didn't go to this school but will test your knowledge on coding and algorithms.",

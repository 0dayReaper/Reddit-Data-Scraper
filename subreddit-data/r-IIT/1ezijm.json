I spent a good portion of last spring looking at how to develop an on campus Student Veteran Organization, now I just need to see if anyone is interested.  If you know anyone that is a veteran, please let them know I am looking for them.  You can contact me on here or at n.wright@shimer.edu\n\nThanks",

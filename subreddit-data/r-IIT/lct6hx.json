    "postText": "My daughter as accepted to IIT but our primary concern is her safety.  I hear that the campus is in a bubble and on campus crime really isn't much of an issue.  Obviously the bigger concern is if she needs to travel off campus.  How bad are things to the south and north?  Any females have issues with safety?  She'd be on a 100% scholarship through ROTC so it'd be a great opportunity (she wants to major in ME), but we're really concerned about the neighborhood.",

Practice basic awareness - not looking at your phone while walking, loud music etc/do dumb stuff to bring attention to yourself and you'll be fine.\n\nThere's a bad stigma that students will say 'never go past 35th' but I've done it and there's no issue. Lived in apartment across highway and \\*\\*was  fine. If there's issues about walking you can access jewel/target/groceries etc via greenline if one isn't confident in walking to nearby markets by foot on campus.",

I lived on campus for 5 years and while there are isolated incidents of people getting their wallet stolen, I didn't feel uncomfortable being out on campus at all hours of the night. The CTA red line is the 24hr option to get to and from campus so it is a little more dicey at night but its no worse than UIC or Loyola or Depaul.",

The campus and Chicago as a whole are plenty safe, arguably more so than my small rural town. \n\nAdvise her on general safety tips if she isn't already knowledgable. Be aware of your surroundings, don't walk alone with your headphones in at 2am, have a check in buddy if you go somewhere you're uncertain about, trust your gut instincts, etc.",

As a 10yr old girl I never had much trouble, and I sometimes took the train there since I lived a bit farther south. It's really just a matter of knowing your landscape and basic safety protocols. \n\nJust like you shouldn't go into known hunting territory during deer season, especially without safety precautions like wearing blaze orange, you should know what blocks are unsafe and you should take an umbrella, pepper spray, a buddy, etc when you're going far.",

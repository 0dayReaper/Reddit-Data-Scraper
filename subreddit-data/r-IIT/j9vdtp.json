            "comment": "I commuted to IIT for two years.\n\nFor my first year of commuting, I primarily rode the CTA trains to campus from the northwest suburbs. I had to drive 10 minutes to my local station, hop on the blue line, then transfer to the green line. My commutes averaged around 60-90 minutes. Excluding gas money, this method of commuting was free because I used my U-Pass, which granted me free rides on CTA trains/busses. The CTA trains were almost always unreliable due to the CTA's inconsistencies with commute times and frequent construction. You can reach IIT via the red line (35th/Bronzeville) or green line (35th-Bronzeville-IIT). Both are relatively safe during the day. You may see some interesting characters on the train and the occasional panhandler, but there's nothing to worry about. However, I would be cautious about boarding CTA trains at night. I've boarded CTA trains as late as 11 PM for when I've had late night lectures and club meetings, and while I've never been mugged or harmed, I still felt uncomfortable by the sketchy people boarding late night trains. If you're stuck at campus at night, I suggest calling an Uber or getting a ride from a friend, or calling campus security to transport you home for free (although they'll only go as far as 2 miles). \n\n**I would not recommend the CTA as a mode of transportation to campus unless you need to board a single line to reach the campus, or if you're looking for a frugal way of commuting.**\n\nFor my second year of commuting, I drove to campus. My commutes averaged 25-35 mins with no traffic, or 45-65 mins with heavy traffic. Parking is $6 a day, or $230 a semester. I've heard from friends that there are free parking lots near campus, but you take the risk of not having on-site campus security watching over your vehicle. Having a car on campus can be extremely beneficial. Bronzeville has the misfortune of being a food desert, so finding restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance of campus can be challenging. Having a car allows you to expand your options for meals. A significant drawback of commuting via car is the brutal commute times, especially in the mornings and after 4 pm. Additionally, you'll have to factor in gas money. Parking is free at all IIT parking lots from 7 PM to 7 AM, Monday to Friday, and free on the weekends, so if you're attending night courses or visiting friends every weekend on campus, this may benefit you.\n\nQuick side note: I've had one instance where someone dented my hood while I was in class, and another instance where someone broke into my vehicle but didn't steal anything. I've contacted campus security in regards to both matters but they've done nothing to assist me.\n\n**I would recommend driving to campus if you have a car and are willing to fork up the money for parking.**\n\nCompared to IIT, UIC is situated in and around West Loop, Greektown, Little Italy, Pilsen, and the Taylor St. neighborhoods of Chicago. While these areas may have been frightening in the 90's, they've since flourished to become the homes of fashion boutiques, nightlife, businesses, and restaurants. There are still sketchy neighborhoods nearby, but you shouldn't worry much, as long as you don't stray too far into unfamiliar territories and don't go outside alone during the night. UIC and IIT are about 3 miles away from each other, so their commutes aren't quite different from each other whether you're driving or commuting by train. However, I would strongly argue that the blue line is significantly safer compared to the red/green lines, especially at night.\n\nIn contrast to IIT's food desert, the options for restaurants near UIC (within walking distance) are plentiful. They've got Jim's, Al's, Joy Yee, Ghareeb Nawaz (although it's terrible compared to their Devon Ave. location), a ton of chain restaurants, and many amazing family-owned Mexican/Latin restaurants nearby, in addition to the tons of nearby bars.\n\nParking is significantly more expensive at UIC. I believe the daily rates for parking are $10-15, and semester parking passes cost $371. UIC does have roofed/multi-level parking, which can help to deter anyone from robbing your car.\n\nPlease don't let my comment discourage you from attending IIT. If you're choosing to study CS at either university, I would suggest IIT. I've had to make to this same decision too, and I have no regrets picking IIT. Both schools are not social playgrounds by any means. UIC is a commuter school, meaning the campus is dead after 4 pm. IIT is blessed with a large international student body living on campus, but IIT's rigorous curriculum has lead its students to prioritizing studying over socializing.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions.",

                            "comment": "I'm sorry to say this, but commuting from Elmhurst is painful and excruciatingly long, regardless of whether you're attending IIT or UIC. Your only commuting options are to ride the Metra (which is not valid with your U-Pass), or to drive down a good chunk of the I-290/294. I knew a freshman who lived a bit west of Elmhurst, in Lombard, and he had to endure a 1.5-2.5 hour commute everyday on the Metra. It's not fun.\n\nLuckily, you have a car. If you're willing to make the drive, I believe your commute would be more than an hour.\n\nIf your commute is longer than 20 miles, you may have to live on campus, as per the university's \"[Two-Year Student Live-On-Campus Residency Requirement](https://web.iit.edu/housing/two-year-student-live-campus-residency-requirement)\". This is a common rule instituted at many universities, including the University of Chicago. I don't believe this is the case with UIC, but don't quote me on that.\n\nI strongly suggest that you consider talking to your parents/guardian about living on campus. Also, please consider talking to both universities about student housing scholarship opportunities. I believe Illinois Tech's [Camras Scholarship](https://www.iit.edu/admissions-aid/tuition-and-aid/scholarships/first-year-student-scholarships/camras-scholars-program) and the [Duchossois Scholarship](https://www.iit.edu/admissions-aid/tuition-and-aid/scholarships/first-year-student-scholarships/duchossois-leadership-scholars-program) both provide free room and board.\n\nThe colored lines that I mentioned represent specific train lines within Chicago's \"L\" train system. [Here's an image of the train's map](https://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/6/ctamap_Lsystem.png), so that you can get a better understanding of what I mean.",

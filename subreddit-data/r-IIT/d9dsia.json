    "postText": "Hello, i'm currently applying for a masters of energy systems. I've completed my BSEE with a 3.3 and am currently working in the engineering consulting field. I'm curious as to how heavily GPA is considered, is a steady job considered at all?\n\nI'm looking at this program over UIC's master as it has many more courses related to what intrigues me. Any information or insight would be greatly appreciated. TIA!",

That can help off set a lower GPA. I got admitted into the ITM IT master's with an undergraduate GPA of 3.7, an in my opinion terrible admissions essay, and I deliberately left off my GRE scores cause I felt they were a little low. Best of luck man and I hope they see your passion and let you into the program you are looking to get into. They seem to be able to spot passionate people with a love of their field easily.",

So with that goal in mind if someone meets minimum entry requirements I don't see them denying entry so I think your chances are good! Hope you get in. I think it's a good school, it has problems like any other school but more days than not I am proud to say I go to IIT!",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am an international student who recently applied to IIT for Fall 2022. I got an email saying I need to submit a Copy of Passport and Financial Affidavit to get an admission decision but the form for the Financial Affidavit has a section where I need to fill the scholarship I got. How does this work ? I will get a scholarship after I get accepted but I need to send this form to get accepted. Please help me.",

I got accepted and than my scholarship was shown. \n\nI would strongly suggest you to contact thardy4@iit.edu because he would be the best person who can help you out. \n\nFYI he is the main international student counselor of the college",

            "comment": "My daughter just completed her first year at IIT as a ChemE student and really enjoyed it.  She does not use Reddit but her are some of the things that she told me.\n\n1.  The department is small.  Her incoming class had about 15 students.  Some changed majors taking the number down to about 12-13.  She heard that in recent years they do pick up a handful of transfer students and typically graduate 15-20.    \n2. She has met and talked to many of the professors and they do appear to be accessible and accommodating.\n3. The student chapter of American Institute of Chemical Engineers is pretty active.\n4. She felt that the department and students do promote a collaborative environment as opposed to a competitive one.\n\nHopefully one of the current students will run across this post and can give you the information that you really want.  If not, I hope that this is a good starting point.",

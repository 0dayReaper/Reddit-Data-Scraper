    "postText": "Hi! I'm in the final stages of deciding on a school for masters. I have gained admission for M.A.S in Information Technology Management with a concentration in Cybersecurity and upon plenty research, it seems the majority consensus for the school in general is quite underwhelming. I was wondering however, if their ITM program is good, with good lecturers, and all other things being equal, if there are good chances for employment?",

There were some classes and professors that were pretty bad but overall the class experience was good. I also had several solid job opportunities including an offer from a FAANG company. I know it\u2019s slightly different from the Masters program but I thought I could share my experiences. Feel free to DM me with other questions.",

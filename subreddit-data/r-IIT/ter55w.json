I am looking into a single-room apartment at Cunningham Hall (as I do like my privacy), but I am also curious about what everyone thinks of the dorms. Also, what is student life like at IIT? \n\nThanks, everyone\\~ I really appreciate it!",

Not a great place for partying.  \nThe people *are* nice though, or at least all the ones I\u2019ve met have been, so if you\u2019re willing to play the outgoing part it should not be hard to make friends.",

I think we are all struggling with housing. That's probably because fall 22 is still far. So landlords might not know yet what will be available by August.\nI'm looking for a one bedroom house/apartment, I'm moving with my wife and son. Do you think I could find housing cheaper than $950? The stipend of my scholarship is very limited.",

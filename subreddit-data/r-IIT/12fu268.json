My experience with finding internships and a job after graduation was that IITs job fair and career services were good for practice at interviews and resume building, but all my internships and the job I landed after school all came from my own search efforts by going to other job fairs at conventions around the US. IIT had a scholarship that helped pay for travel to those conventions so i Appreciate that",

I think no matter what university you go to, you'll find that the Univeristy doesn't just \"place\" you into a position. You'll need to figure out which industry you're interested in, what you want to specialize in, and what's available in the location you want to live in. It requires a lot of work on your part to build your resume through more than just your education. By the time you graduate,  you should have not only a decent GPA (at least higher than 3.2 is good), but you should show that you worked on different projects, participated in competitions, joined extracurricular groups that interested you, and have some internships along the way. \n\nIIT has over 200 student groups to be apart of. I my self was in AIAA, ACS, Illinois Tech Rocketry, and SHPE. Professional organizations like AIAA, ACS, and SHPE go a long way at helping prepare you for professional life after college. \n\nIIT does have a career guidance center that can help you when it comes to building your resume and prepping you for interviews. But it comes down to your motivation at finding internships, research positions, and landing a job after graduation.",

UGA is a very good school with a very good social life. Penn state  has the best computer science program out of all. But penn state is in the middle of nowhere so less internship and connection opportunities as you would have in a big city. I don't have much say about Drexel. In my opinion UGA would be the best option it is an outstanding school and it is an hour away from Atlanta. You can get good internships and connections to land an excellent job fresh out of college.",

Honestly crown hall is a pretty shitty building and the rest of the halls and residences are poorly maintained and eye sores.",

            "comment": "The campus is nothing but dull, drab and disgusting at times, and anyone who vehemently disagrees must\u2019ve attended a much different IIT than I. It was honestly depressing. It\u2019s okay during the summer/fall thanks to the nice weather and the trees, grass, etc adding the much needed color, but man when it got into the heart of winter, nothing but black, white, and and shades of grey. And that\u2019s not even counting the state of the buildings. I can\u2019t think of a single building  on campus that has been maintained properly, Kaplan included with its cracking concrete floor weeks after opening, constant leaking and flooding in E1/Rettaliata, the general disarray of the Tech buildings and the Tower with improperly maintained elevators (seemed like at least one was always down every other week or so), mold taking over at least North Hall in MSV, the unfinished \u201caesthetic\u201d of MTCC, Stuart looking just absolutely run down, Siegel hall not too far behind, etc. I could go on for a while. With all the money IIT pulls in, I think the board can take a pay cut to provide the students with the facilities they deserve for the price they pay. At least match UIC or DePaul ffs. I understand their buildings are in different locations and benefit from better development around them but hell. \nThey could be treating the buildings so much better but then again I guess they\u2019re treating them as well as they do most of their degree programs save for their precious architecture program so I guess I can\u2019t be surprised. Can\u2019t afford 10k for proper barebones PCs for ITM students to learn to build PCs on but let\u2019s put more money into keeping Mies\u2019 buildings from falling in on themselves. \nIIT fostered a terrible environment for learning by reflecting how much they care about their students in how they maintain the buildings.\nSorry for going a bit off topic, but always happy to see someone share the same mindset about IIT\u2019s \u201carchitecture\u201d",

The homes surrounding IIT still stand and keep out water unlike the Miesian building of IIT. It's almost like the university likes throwing students money away on fixing these buildings that weren't designed to 2022 where as buildings built in the 1800s and early 1900 can be retrofitted easier and cheaper and maintained better. I worked for four seasons hvac and worked in the neighborhood putting in furnace and acs those homes are castles and built like castles the only reason they would be destroyed is egotism and racism.",

Granted I\u2019ve only ever seen photos of the buildings that once stood where Mies\u2019 buildings now stand but I think they\u2019d absolutely bring a much vibrant and better atmosphere to the campus, especially if properly maintained.\nIt is very ironic in my opinion that for a school that prides itself on its architecture and it\u2019s corresponding program, it can\u2019t even maintain their buildings properly or even build new construction without it degrading mere weeks after being opened.\nThat\u2019s the funny thing isn\u2019t it? Buildings and homes that saw the Mies buildings go up will probably still be around and kicking once the Mies buildings collapse in on themselves, either due to the shoddy design or the combined weight of the hubris of the Mies society.\nI do like minimalist design here and there, but it just does not work in the long term, least how it was implemented.",

Especially given Armour used to be gorgeous (and the OG campus) and is literally nothing now. \n\nEven ignoring that IIT is on top of a bulldozed historically black community, the whole campus is a dilapidated copycat of an outdated architect, which is upsetting given our status as an architecture school. The amount of mold and asbestos students have been exposed to is literally criminal, and the fact that most of the buildings and student housing are either sinking or not up to code is just embarrassing given the number of architectural and environmental engineers we put out.",

There are many other chicago buildings older and less maintained that are in better condition. I think it's time for the architecture community to admit Mies was a shitty designer who ruined the character of the southside.",

She already declared majors and  our dad refuses to pay the remaining balance of 9k unless she has a major worth it according to him. How hard is it to switch to a STEM major at IIT when it wasn't one of your options given to you when IIT accepted you.",

As far as I know, only a few majors require special admissions requirements, such as architecture.\n\nI recommend contacting her academic advisor and asking them, they helped me switch majors really quickly.",

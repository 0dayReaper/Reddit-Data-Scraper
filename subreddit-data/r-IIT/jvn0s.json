    "postText": "I'd totes be up for Frolf Thursday and Tuesday mornings. The only problem is, I only have discs for myself, so, I've tried scouring the maps for locations close to buy discs. Problem is, there really are none. So, the best bet is to buy them off of Amazon. Look, I know it'll be a little bit of money to get into the actual thing. A beginner set on Amazon is $20 bucks. But think of all the hours you can spend, hanging out, just throwing some discs at nets?",

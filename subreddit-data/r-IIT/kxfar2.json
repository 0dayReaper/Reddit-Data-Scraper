    "postText": "Hello, I was recently accepted for CS and I'm going to be receiving 25,000 in a transfer scholarship and 5,000 for a PTK scholarship. Is the price difference worth it? I mean, the tuition here is already (like) 40-50 thousand dollars in difference. Are the opportunities after graduating better?\n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "I will say that IIT ended up being free for me to attend thanks to scholarships, and that's the only reason I chose it.  If there's another school that would be cheaper for you, I'd highly recommend going there.  Aside from our architecture and aerospace engineering programs, we don't have any standout departments that would make a huge difference in your education, and institutional support for pursuing internships and post graduation employment is almost nonexistent.  Whatever your career ends up being after IIT will be 100% up to you and your personal connections; all of the recruitment fairs from the past four have gotten abysmal for students, because companies quite frankly don't know about us and don't care to recruit from us.",

            "comment": "It depends on what you\u2019re applying for after college, your experience, skill level, etc. Lets say on an entry level software engineering job you make 50k/year (lower end), can you take pay off the loan of ~100k? (Probably more, tuition always goes up). \n\nThe degree is a cherry on top when applying for jobs, go where ever you think can get you the most knowledge and professional experience possible. Employers want great people, not someone who went to IIT compared to UIC or really any school.",

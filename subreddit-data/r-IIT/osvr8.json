    "postText": "Hi, let me introduce myself first, I'm a redditor from Barcelona and I'm coming to IIT to do my MSc research. The thing is that looking for an apartment from here is pretty difficult and the other day someone mentioned \"Guest houses\" on Gunsaulus. Would someone kindly help me a little? I'd be coming wih two classmates from here but I think we could survive in a one bedroom if it's only for a short time, no?\n\n**tl;dr:** exchange redditor looking for landing apartment",

But I don't think anyone can live with you unless they are also grad students or you are married. \n\nThere are a lot of apartments near here and around Chicago that other people can recommend. I'm not too familiar with the non-campus housing available.",

I am from the US, but not Chicago, and registered for the apartment online from the My Room page (it should be on one of the links from the last post). You will need your CID (it should be a letter+number combination on your admittance information), but you can do it all online.\n\nYou can also e-mail housing@iit.edu directly with questions - they are generally helpful and responsive on these matters.

You generally want to look for things in the Armour Square/Bridgeport area. It technically lists campus as being in the Douglas neighborhood but you totally want to live west of campus over the highway, much nicer area. ",

I had him last years of that class, he's the best but if you're gonna take Dr. K for CS 116 after a class with Hanrath, be ready to learn some stuff on your own.\n\nAlso, random hint for Hanrath's class. When he guesses all the people who are left-handed, tell him it's cuz he watched you guys during the exam and memorized all the left-handed people. ",

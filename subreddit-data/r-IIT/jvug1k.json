Because of corona I\u2019m stuck taking my classes from home which is really boring, but also good since I saved a lot of money from room and board. Because of this I don\u2019t know much about how campus life is like. \n\nI\u2019m a CS major and I think my CS classes are really interesting and easily the best part of my schedule. I took MATH251 (aka Calc 3) and my prof is really bad at teaching online so our class has been forced to self learn the content which sucks but we\u2019re doing okay so far. The rest of my classes have been pretty easy and I found myself to have a lot of time on my hands for the most part, probably because my classes are online. \n\nI wish I could give you a clear answer but my perspective is only from online classes so that\u2019s all I know. I hope that somewhat helps",

Because of covid they even have an option to have a whole room for yourself instead of having to room with someone, for the same price. The school took a lot of steps to keep everyone safe but I still stayed home just because it was the cheapest option. Most of my classes were online anyways so I saw no point in staying on campus.",

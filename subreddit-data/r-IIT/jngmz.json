With architecture, theres a huge studio culture of designing, working, late nights, and shenanigans ;) the program is really good because students are also taught the practicality of building design and structure.. Not just aesthetics. Socially, the campus is really vibrant with students from all over the world which is really freaking cool. One of my favorite things about campus is that there's always room for improvement, so students can actively create the change they want to see :)",

If not so much, maybe not.\n\nIf it wasn't obvious, I'm speaking from experience of being a (lady) engineer at IIT, and liking my classmates well enough, but never really fitting in much. None of my good friends are engineers.\n\nOh, and I recommend at least trying out the sororities. Most people I knew there with any active social life were involved with them. But still, 'active social life' is a relative term when talking about a school with (totally making this up) probably well under 1,000 American students who live anywhere near campus.",

It's not bad... even relaxing if you're into that. it took me a month or more to stop wearing makeup constantly like I had to in high school to 'fit in'... it was nice to stop. \n\nIIT sororities are pretty excellent, they are like study parties on wheels... it is also important to have nongreek friends, of course. \n\nThe odds are good but the goods are odd.

My perception is that it has significantly changed the way that outsiders view the school and also the way that students relate to it. I believe that it is, for the most part, well used and enjoyed.\n\nThis building seems to be pretty successful compared to the student unions at schools that I attended and when it comes to criticizing buildings housing schools of architecture, don\u2019t get me started. Among the more conspicuous failures is Paul Rudolph\u2019s school of architecture at Yale. A seminal work in the \u201cBrutalist\u201d style (brutality in architecture being considered a good and clever thing at the time!) it was so well loved by students that they tried to burn it down. Unfortunately, being made of concrete, it was not consumed in the blaze and has since been \u2018restored\u2019 several times to little effect by other famous folk.\n\nYou can always fix a roof leak but you can never repair ugly.\"\n\nUs IIT kids are notorious for complaining. This was an excellent rebuttal of what happened. Water is a building's worst enemy.",

            "comment": "So I see the neck beards of IIT have invaded this comment section!\n\nIn all seriousness, while they make good points, IIT is certainly better than they're making it out to be. Everyone at IIT isn't some social outcast, in MSV alone there's always groups of friends hanging around the lounges and such. SSV has become more of the same recently. There is practically no party scene, but it doesn't matter for me since my friends and I go into downtown every Friday/Saturday night and find something cool/chill to do. IIT is located in the heart of Bronzeville, IMO a beautiful neighborhood with a lot of cool history behind it. Sadly, IIT is filled with sheltered gamer white suburban kids (who probably browse /r/PewdiepieSubmissions and /r/dankmemes) so they immediately dismiss it as 'crime filled' and 'dangerous' because there's a lot of black people. Of course crimes happen, but Bronzeville is making improvements every year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot of faculty that suck, but there's a lot of great faculty too. Reingold, Hale, Saelee, Bauer, Hanrath, etc are great teachers in the CS department. The food has gotten considerably better since Sodexo left IMO, although I live off campus so I mostly cook for myself at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCome visit IIT for yourself and form your own opinion.

I had a 3.6 GPA in high school, 31 ACT, and I went to a low tier public high school in Chicago. They awarded me with full tuition, and some room and board scholarship. I work part time off campus so I can afford an off campus apartment, so at this point I am paying nothing to attend the university. Ask/DM me any questions, and also check out this previous thread for more financial aid input: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IIT/comments/7lzfj6/uhh\\_does\\_anyone\\_still\\_use\\_this\\_subreddit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IIT/comments/7lzfj6/uhh_does_anyone_still_use_this_subreddit/)",

I agree with some of your points about the school, however I also think that you may be a bit biased since you are literally paying close to nothing for going here, as I\u2019m falling into significant debt even though I got a 35 on the ACT and had a 3.9 gpa. (To where I may be a bit more cynical, I admit that). \n\nIf I was paying next to nothing to go to this school I would probably not complain about anything whatsoever, as I said in my previous comment, the school is great if they give you a lot of financial aid options. \n\nSimply saying to someone to who may be attending the school that the social scene isn\u2019t great (especially coming in as a transfer student in CS) I don\u2019t think makes me a neckbeard. I think it\u2019s a fair thing to bring up. Maybe you were targeting the other long comment in this thread, but you did say \u201cneckbeards\u201d\n\nI too get off campus and I mostly spend time with my gf and her friends from another school close to downtown or with my coworkers from my job here on campus. It\u2019s very possible to have a great social life while attending IIT, you just may need to try a little harder for it compared to other institutions, especially as a transfer student. \n\nRant over, basically I\u2019m just upset that simply because someone has a different opinion than you (mostly due to financial reasons) about the school then that doesn\u2019t give you the right to over generalize and INSULT them. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting a great, cheap education here at IIT, and I\u2019m sure it will make you go far in life. Just please try to think a little more before over generalizing and insulting a group of people. \n\n",

The CS building is located directly adjacent to the projects, and occasionally you could hear people fighting from there.\n- Instructors are hit or miss, there\u2019s good professors (like Kyle Hale and Michael Saelee) but there are some _really_ bad ones as well\n- Quality of life sucks. The dorms look like Cold War era Soviet tenements, especially Gunsaulus. For an architecture school, you'd think they would have buildings that look better [than this.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gunsaulus+Hall,+3140+S+Michigan+Ave,+Chicago,+IL+60616/@41.8370965,-87.6234088,3a,75y,266.3h,93.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slXDZljMBL25hQjNP78g1tA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x880e2c736693be1d:0x44500882e3cf8f03!8m2!3d41.8370776!4d-87.6239224) Dorms at MSV are also very depressing and have tons of basic issues\n- SSV is overpriced and not even that good compared to other schools\u2019 options\n- Food sucks ass, they changed providers recently but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s still shit.\n- Incompetent administration\n- No party scene whatsoever.\n- Limited on-campus housing options. You get your pick of MSV or SSV as an underclassman, and you also get the choice of Gunsaulus junior year onward.\n\nIf you consider going to IIT, know the student quality of life is atrocious. I don\u2019t know your personal financial situation but you guys deserve an informed opinion.\n\nThe quality of the education you get overall is pretty decent, and during my time on campus I could tell the faculty were taking steps to make sure the CS curriculum continued to be relevant and useful. You\u2019ll be able to find a job after graduation if you go into CS.\n\nIf I were you I would do everything in my power to see if I can't get in somewhere else and get a decent financial aid package. I'm sure there's something else you can find.",

You do not care/mind there being little to no social scene and are there solely for the education. Try to make friends welcome week as they will probably be your friends until you graduate (just speaking from personal experience and from what I have seen). This isn\u2019t just an IIT problem, but a tech school problem as well as seen in other institutions. \n\n2. They offer you a significant financial aid package if you are taking out any sort of loans. I\u2019m fully finding my education here via government student loans and even with getting about 50% of my tuition off from scholarships I feel like I am paying too much for what I\u2019m getting. I would not pay more than 10-15k a year at most for everything. \n\n3. You have a backup school in mind that will take most of IIT\u2019s credits if you want/need to transfer. If you are in the CS department you should be okay but for other departments enrollment is WAY down and funding is being cut, so it\u2019s unclear as to what\u2019s going to happen there. CS gets tons of grants so that shouldn\u2019t be an issue though, just know that IIT certainly isn\u2019t at its peak. \n\nOverall, the school is okay if your going into cs and you get a lot of aid. Find some friends day 1 to help you get through classes because the curriculum certainly isn\u2019t easy (from a mix of bad professors as well as from great professors challenging you and thus making you learn a lot). If you put in the work you will leave here ready for a CS position at even the top companies. Let me know if you have any questions. \n\nEdit: In regards to your financial aid question, I\u2019ll be completely transparent and say I came in as a freshman and my mom didn\u2019t work and my dad made around 65k a year and I got about 50% off tuition. My GPA was similar to yours. ",

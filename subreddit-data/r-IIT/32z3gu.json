    "postText": "I will be a Civil Engineering student this coming fall and having a tough time finding a good laptop, and not knowing much about computer hardware doesn't help.  I know that CAD programs demand a lot of resources from a computer ( http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/inventor-products/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/System-requirements-for-Autodesk-Inventor-Products.html) and buying something to fit those specs of whatever current program you guys use won't be cheap.  However I also want to do some gaming on the side.  I could bring my Xbox but I would rather not lug that half way across the country.  GTA is a game I would like to run on my computer( https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/203428177-Grand-Theft-Auto-V-PC-System-Specs).  So my question is this, since you guys know what programs you are using and know what laptops can handle them what do you recommend that is a 2 in 1 package that is good at both? Thanks in advance for the help.",

The only software you'll use is AutoCAD, Mathematica, MATLAB or notepad++ in the first 3 years.\n\nBut most of the PCs in the labs have the software I mentioned.\n\nI have a laptop from around 2010 that can run all these and LOL.\n\nMy advice is either wait another semester or two and see if you really need a high end laptop.For now buy a basic one that might be able to run older versions of some of the software. \n\nIf you really want gaming, buy a gaming computer.",

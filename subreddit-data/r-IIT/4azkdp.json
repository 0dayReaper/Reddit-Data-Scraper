    "postText": "I might be starting this Fall and I would like to know more about IIT. Firstly, I would like to know how intense the program is and how does IIT support specifications of architecture (for example, I heard it's function and technical oriented, is that true?) \nSecondly, What is the social life like at IIT? I mean in terms of being an architecture student! I've heard that IIT is not that social compared to other Universities, but being an architecture student would definitely isolate you from the outside world (at least from what I've heard) and does anyone have an option besides joining Greek Life because I'm not really interested in that kind of thing, but I don't want to go off as anti-social either. \nand lastly, MOTIVATIONAL advice that will get me thru college would be helpful LOL THANKS",

            "comment": "Congrats! I second what postpostmodernism says. I was there pre-Wiel Arets, but it is definitely intensive. Learn the boundaries of your body and mind, and know when too much is too much. Go above and beyond when you can, you will stand out to professors. I never pulled an all-nighter, that's just ridiculous. Find a way to be efficient with your time as soon as possible. Seek out a mentor. Get involved in student organizations, that shows a LOT during college, and when you graduate. There are a lot of opportunities for scholarships and awards during your time at IIT, so the more you can get involved on campus, the more you can put on your resume (leadership scholarship and awards, etc) Architects are as social as you want them to be. I was told I was one of the more social archies (friends with engineers, etc), and I'm proud of it. Archies usually end up socializing with themselves. I would recommend not dating an architecture student, as there is too much competition involved, and if things go bad, you have to deal with them for 5 years. Greek life is an option for social life, but get information from student activities as soon as you can to find an organization that can be the right fit. You can always start student orgs as well. If you feel you have time for an on campus job (somehow I did) thats a great way to meet people as well. Utilize and explore the city of Chicago as much as you can, it'll make you a better person. Enjoy the art and architecture life it has to offer, your experience will be more enriched. Private message me if you have any further questions! - Graduated 2011",

I don't know why you rule out Greek life without actually experiencing it. It seems like a preconceived notion with no bearing, especially after you noted that IIT social life isn't comparable to other schools. Plus, you'll be near the city. You have plenty of opportunities to meet people outside of school. It all depends on how you look at things. \n\nGo Greek\n\nPs I was there during the Mies and arets curricula. I'd be happy to answer specific questions. ",

            "comment": "I can't comment on the current program as much since the dean changed to Wiel Arets after I graduated, and I heard he has changed a lot.  \n\nArchitecture school anywhere is intense.  Lots of late nights working.  Most of your friends will end up being other architecture students unless you make an effort to get out and meet others.  IIT students do tend to be less social overall, but there's a mix of everything there.  They also tend to be more driven, so if a group of them all like something there's a good chance they'll start a club for it or actually get involved in it.  How involved you are in this sort of thing is up to you to put yourself out there.  The greek life isn't as bad as the kind you'll see at state schools - even our greek kids tend to be pretty nerdy and relatively quiet.  They do still have parties and stuff, and that wasn't my scene personally back in college, but it's not as bad as you might expect.  I had a lot of friends (through the arch program) that were also in greek life and enjoyed it.  ",

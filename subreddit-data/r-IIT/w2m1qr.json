I'm getting my visa within the next 2 weeks. \n\nI cannot enquire for you, no one can except you. \n\nDid you check your application portal and see if u even have been admitted or not?\n\nIf you have been admitted than you should be seeing \"Admit!\" And also flight visa input options aswell as scholarship amounts. \n\nQuickly email ugaa@iit.edu right now. They are the undergraduate office and they will ofcourse email you back soon. \n\nTo be honest, u won't be able to attend 15th August and you will have to defer your semester to spring 2023. \n\nNo way you will be able to get a F1 visa interview in the next 2 weeks. \n\nIf this is your first time than u still have the option to defer. First see if you are admitted or not than contact the email I sent you. \n\nPls don't rush with visa interview. You won't be able to make it in 3 weeks. Best to defer semester and get an i20 with a semester start date of January which is the spring semester.",

            "comment": "IIT offers potential students ostensibly good scholarships. The reality is that it is not worth exchanging some extra scholarship money from tier 3-4 school for a four years of misery, depression, and damaged mental health, unless you are some kind of special case. Also, if your social skills are lackluster, avoid this school like a plague. Go to school that offers healthy social environment, it is way more important.",

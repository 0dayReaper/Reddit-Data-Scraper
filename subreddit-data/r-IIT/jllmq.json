    "postText": "IIT is trying out a new program, called B-cycle. It's sort of like the car sharing systems, except you can ride the bike to another location and drop it off. ONLY for this year, you can get a pass that's good for the *entire* school year for $25. You don't have to worry about bike repair or if someone steals it, because insurance is included in that 25 bucks. \n\nLong story short, IIT is trying to figure out if having a bike program on campus is worth it... is there enough students on campus who would use it?\n\n\nHere's the link for more info and to see other b-cycle kiosks in the city:\nhttp://chicago.bcycle.com/",

            "comment": "I  think it is totally worth it. I was up at Museum Campus over the weekend and did not want to train or bus back to IIT, so I grabbed a bike, rode the lakeshore, and made it back in no time. If I recall, it was pretty cheap, too, since I only had it out for like twenty minutes.  \n\nThe only times I can see myself use it are when I'm in situations similar to the above: I got somewhere without my bike, but biking back would be easier/quicker/cheaper/more fun.\n\nOtherwise, if I'm explicitly going biking, I will use my bike.

Probably because there are a million fantastic uses for it.  Wanna go checkout downtown with some friends, but don't wanna take public transit?  Bcycle.  Grab groceries from the ghetto-Jewel or Cermak in Bridgeport?  Bcycle.  Hit up a local bar?  Bcycle.  And probably a million others, too.",

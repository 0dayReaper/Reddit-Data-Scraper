I want to know what the interview is like, what kind of questions to expect.\n\nI've done interviews for job applications, so is it the same kind of questions for MS?\n\nThe interview is part of their On-Spot Admission program, so if anyone has experience in this, please share.",

They just asked me to introduce myself and a little about why I'm interested in the course. Then I was offered the admit with a scholarship. Hope this helps, and if you're already done, hope it went well :D \n\nDM me either way if you wish",

They asked me to talk about myself and then they asked me why Masters in CS specifically in IIT.\n\nI don't have interests in doing research, I just talked about what I wanted to do with this Masters degree at IIT",

I have read some news about the area's safety.   \nWhat are some tips? Also what would be the best mode of transport, is it a cab like Lyft only?",

It's a big, wonderful city, and the majority of the violence you hear about is domestic and gang violence.\n\n If you need to travel during the night hours, it's best to do so in a group, but that doesn't mean that anyone traveling alone at night is automatically going to get robbed. Just be mindful of your self and your surroundings. Dont walk our headphones in, and walk confidently as if you know exactly where you are headed. \n\nIf you hear gunfire close by (I only had this happen to me once in my 15 years in Chicago), drop to the ground and get as low as possible. Once it's safe, remove yourself from the area. Don't stick around waiting for the police to show up.\n\nAgain, this city is awesome, and there is SO MUCH to do here. A lot of those things happen in the evening. So don't be afraid to go out and experience those events!",

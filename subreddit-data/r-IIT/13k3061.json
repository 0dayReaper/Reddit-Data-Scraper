            "comment": "Not a lot of traffic here now that the semester has ended.   I graduated with BSCE in 1994 and my daughter is currently a ChemE student there so I cannot answer to much about the current CE program other than that there are still a handful of professors still around from my time.  However, I have worked with and hired many IIT grads over the years and found that most were very well prepared for work with just the BS (we targeted Purdue and Iowa State grads for this as well).\n\nI have never hired or worked with (to my knowledge) a UIC civil engineer.  It is not an inditement of the program but I have just never come that many.\n\nI have worked with a few NU CE grads.  However, only one was actually working as a licensed engineer.  Most of them used the BSCE as a spring board for a law degree (Environmental Engineering to Environmental law, Construction Management to Contract/Construction law, etc.)\n\nHopefully this gives you something.",

However, most were working in WI and I did not start working them to they were out of school for several years so I am not sure what can be contributed to the MSOE education vs. work work experience.  \n\nIt seems to me that MSOE does have a little more limited regional appeal to hiring companies (all of the engineers that I know live in WI) so I would look at their outcomes and what companies hire MSOE grads.  Is there a geographical concentration that would pose a problem for you?  If not, MSOE is ABET accredited in Civil Engineering so I would consider it a viable option if you like the feel of a small, private STEM university.",

Geographically Im hoping to work in the Great Lakes region, so regional prestige and network is more important than National for me. \n\nOther than that looking at programs that will provide me with the best skills to hit the ground running. But with IIT being so close to home that\u2019s looking like a pretty good option. Also cool that Iowa State produces great engineers since that\u2019s my wife\u2019s alma matter.\n\nAgain, I really appreciate the guidance from an experienced Engineer!",

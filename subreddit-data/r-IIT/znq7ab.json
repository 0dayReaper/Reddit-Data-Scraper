    "postText": "My application tracker has had a status of \"pending decision,\" for about a month. As I was filing some emails, I realized that I didn't click all the links in one that was sent Nov 23. The link is to a page with a video for accepted students and offering me congratulations. There is no indication of my intended major nor have I received any information about setting up a school portal/email, etc. So, was I admitted or did they just send me an email with a bad link? Seems like a silly question so I thought I'd put it to the crowd before I go make a fool of myself. TIA!",

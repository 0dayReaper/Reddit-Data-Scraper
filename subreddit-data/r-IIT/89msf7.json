If anyone can give their input on it, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you!",

            "comment": "CS major here. I think it's pretty darn good. They say Stanford is the west coast IIT. But seriously, while it's not like MIT, tons of the course content is taken from classes from places like Stanford. The classes are appropriately challenging at each level, and there's a lot of good CS faculty. You learn everything from assembly to high level software engineering.\n\nI am in the coterminal program that will net me a masters in CS as well with only 2 extra semesters. It's pretty OP if you'd ask me. The 500-level masters courses let you specialize in fields and a many undergrad courses are critical to the job market.\n\nI have friends at other universities in the area, and when we talk about our programs they usually feel like they're not learning good stuff while I feel like I'm learning too much good stuff here.\n\nAbove everything you should be passionate or at least very curious about how computers and primarily software works. Side projects are crucial at any university.\n\nWhat area are you from? Let me know if you have any questions.",

                            "comment": "UNIX and the POSIX standards are explored pretty heavily here (for good reason). With that being said, many of the core courses in your first few semesters will involve writing in C in a linux environment (C is taught alongside architecture/assembly). In the OS course, you will master the inner workings of unix by modifying xv6, a unix replica.\n\nBesides the core OOP classes, which you should skip out of if you do well on the AP test, Java is not a main focus. The data structures course is in Python. You are free to use any applicable programming language you desire in your remainder of classes.\n\nAs for theory vs practice, I think it's a good mix of both. I'd say there is some theory early on with discrete structures and algorithms, but after that you're doing lots of real-life stuff.\n\nHope I make sense; let me know if you want me to clarify anything!",

Also there is some paperwork during your first co-terminal semester that you need to fill out so they know you have a plan and are aware of any financial aid differences.\n\nWorkloads are just right most of the time. What makes it properly challenging is that the programming assignments are advanced enough that lectures won't teach you how to do them (that would make them easy, and you wouldn't learn to solve problems on your own), you must take your own time playing around in the system at hand to understand it and implement what you need to implement. The real learning comes from doing the assignments. I think I've become a better programmer from courses that do it this way. I will say it's a lot of work though, and better teachers could make things much easier.\n\nTeacher-wise, there are a few really good teachers in the CS department that seem life-changing, but many not so inspirational. A main problem for me at least, is a good chunk don't have English as their native language, which makes it harder to express concepts, and they tend to have bad slides.",

This means that you will not have employers reaching out to you and hosting campus events in the same way that you would at CMU or something. So while you might end up with great skills, you'll need to put a little more effort into building your career than students at those schools.",

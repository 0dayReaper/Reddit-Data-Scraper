    "postText": "I'm an international student and recently applied to IIT through EngineeringCAS since I didn't have a program passcode. I started my application on 2nd December. I submitted all my documents in the engineeringcas portal. This morning I received a mail stating that some documents were missing and it needs to be submitted directly to Illinois Tech in pdf format. However in order to submit it through the myIIT portal I need a passcode.",

I got admitted to spring semester and I'm now getting ready for my visa. so all my requirements are done and I might be able to help u down the road if u want :)\n\nEdit: i think you are talking about a pin right? That pin will be given after you talk with an advisor which will be provided to you after you deposit your enrollment fee. \n\nYou have to provide the materials through e-mail to ugaprocessing@iit.edu",

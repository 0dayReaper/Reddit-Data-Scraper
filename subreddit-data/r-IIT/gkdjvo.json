    "postText": "Just as the title says. \n\nI'd like to know your thoughts on IIT's CS program. What does it focus on? Is it more theoretical? \nI've heard from a Math professor at my CC that he only learned more theoretical CS. Has IIT's program changed over the years which would make it a viable option in actual programming? \nWould you say its CS program prepares students for a Software Engineering role once they graduate?\n\nAnd finally, why the lack of requirements? Is there a variety of electives? \n\nP.s. Also, what is the institution known for? (Ex. Architecture, medicine, engineering, computer science)",

            "comment": "The institutions most prestigious program is certainly architecture, however we have a pretty decent engineering and law program. \n\nThe CS program is fairly good, and IIT has a very good selection of electives to take with the lack of requirements for CS.",

I didn't have much dealings with the CS department but from my understanding it is less applied than the ITM department but not overly theoretical.  Again not an actual CS student so take with a grain of salt.  You might try to schools facebook group, it has a lot more traffic than this Reddit sub.  Overall I was very satisfied with my experience in the ITM department 10/10 would recommend.",

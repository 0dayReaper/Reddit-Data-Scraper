    "postText": "So I just attended scholarship weekend and was really impressed with IIT.  It was an awesome school.  Anyway, I was considered for the Camras scholarship and I feel confident with my interview however the fact that I have to keep a 3.25 GPA scared me a little.  I have taken a few Syracuse university classes but only for american history an economics.  I have not taken any AP courses.  A lot of the students I meet had taken multiple AP courses. This doesn't mean I'm a bad student I have high grades in the honors classes I do take but my consideration for the scholarship probably fell on the fact that I am an Eagle Scout.  So my question is how hard was it to adjust to the learning style at IIT and maintain that GPA?",

And if you are chosen they believe even more. Plus you can appeal if you have a bad semester. So relax don't worry about the requirement too much. ",

Get involved on campus and make friends with similar goals. Having friends who want to succeed at school just as much as you is a huge help when you are studying for a test or something along those lines. ",

In the past if you have an off semester they will put you on probation and usually the student does well the next semester and is above a 3.25 again. ",

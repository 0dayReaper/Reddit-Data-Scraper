I believe it's a fairly new program and it's essentially a CS degree with a specialization on machine learning and artificial intelligence, but the degree is pretty special as IIT is one of only a small number of schools offering this type of program. It was just created last year so I'm not sure if you'll find anyone who's done the whole program yet.",

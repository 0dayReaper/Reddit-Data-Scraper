    "postText": "Did anyone else's Google account storage decrease from unlimited to 500MB? I checked my email for any announcement but didn't find anything. It must have happened over night because last night I was editing a Sheet and then went to edit it this morning and was hit with a \"you're out of storage, you can't edit this\". I graduated in 2016 and have had unlimited storage since then, and it was my understanding that this was an intentional benefit, not like a loophole kind of situation. This frustratingly affects my work today, and I could've at least prepared for this situation if there was some kind of notice.",

Now all of a sudden it stops working? \n\nI don't know if we were ever promised a certain lifespan for this storage capacity, but getting told that we don't have storage all of a sudden is ridiculous. No warning in advance. Maybe someone could write to the IT front desk or whatever it's called and ask what the deal is?\n\nedit: just sent them an email. Will report back when i get a response.",

Alumni will only be allowed 500MB of storage in Google going forward.  If you have reached this limit, we recommend that you start moving your data to other cloud services.\n\n&gt;Please note that you won't lose data currently in Google Drive, however, you will not be able to add anymore until you are below the size limit.\n\n&gt;Thank you.\n\n&gt;OTS Support Desk\n\nthis sucks",

There should have been an advance notice about this unless Google didn't give IIT any notice which I highly doubt.\nThey also turned off access to my.iit.edu a few weeks ago about which there was no advance notice either.",

            "comment": "IIT like any school is going to be what you make of it. The campus tends to be pretty quite. Don't expect some big party every weekend but with that said you have the rest of the city to explore. If you are somewhat sociable you will have no issue finding people/orgs both on and off campus. With that said if you expect IIT to make you a sociable person it will definitely not do that. I joined a fraternity and they are in general more sociable. But also have their own list of pros and cons. If you have questions about Greek life feel free to DM. One suggestion I would make is go onto https://hawklink.iit.edu/ and see if there are any active groups you are interested in.",

UIUC offers more of a traditional college experience while IIT is more city life. Consider which one you would like to experience more.",

I made some great friends there and it's really fun to go into the city late at night or go out to bars, but the school really sucks at putting on events and the frats don't put on any open parties. I transferred after 2 years Ann's just finished my 1st year at Ohio State and I enjoyed it so much more. If you want to pm me you can. Some people will disagree with me and I get that my opinions can be pretty strong on this topic",

    "postText": "I'm trying to decide between IIT and CMU, and the cost for both are similar enough in price with IIT being somewhat cheaper. So now I'm more concerned about other factors:  \n\\- quality of the programs  \n\\- social scene/campus life  \n\\- job/internship opportunities during and after school  \n\\- overall comfort at the school  \n\\- getting the most out of my time and money at either school  \n I should also add that I visited both schools and while I prefer the campus at Carnegie, I really liked Chicago and could see myself living there in the future, and a plus for me is that if I was to work in Chicago after school I'd already know people there",

            "comment": "IIT's architecture program has changed a lot since I was in it (2013), but the best thing about the school is many professors have a full time job in addition to teaching. It's a B.Arch, which is a five year undergrad program that leads directly to licensure. (Looks like CMU has the same degree) There are typically lots of internship opportunities and job opportunities because of the professor's industry connections. \n\nDon't listen to the other person calling it a 'sketchy' part of town. IIT's neighborhood is plenty safe, there are just more people of color than white people so the racial bias comes in strong. \n\nThe comments about the social life being dead are 100% true. Def go to Carnegie if you want that.",

It's a big city; the more people, the higher chance of crime. Just because 'a crime' happened does not make a neighborhood \"sketchy\".\n\nMap of Total Reported Crimes:\n\n[https://chicagopd.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=96ca65e89cd54b8c808b136a66778369](https://chicagopd.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=96ca65e89cd54b8c808b136a66778369)\n\nMap of Violent Crimes:  \n[https://chicagopd.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/8ed0652c9b2a4bc6bf1173e6aae6add4](https://chicagopd.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/8ed0652c9b2a4bc6bf1173e6aae6add4)\n\nMap of Known Gang Territories 2022:  \n[https://gis.chicagopolice.org/pages/gang-maps](https://gis.chicagopolice.org/pages/gang-maps)\n\nOh look, crime is everywhere! It's in fact higher in downtown than it is in IIT's neighborhood! Maybe do some actual research before making a claim based on your own internal fears.\n\nBig cities require you to be more aware of your surroundings and pay attention when walking home at 2AM. They don't require you to be racist.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t comment often but without a question you should go to CMU, and you will miss out on so many opportunities if you choose to go IIT. Obviously both arch. programs are great, but CMU\u2019s is better. Campus life at IIT is dead compared to CMU. The fact that CMU is a pretty prestigious university recognized by the best of companies means that applying for jobs will be very easy. A CMU professor asked his class if anyone was interested in interning at Meta and my friends were given the internship without even interviewing solely because they went to CMU. Now you will definitely have to work harder at CMU than IIT because coursework will surely be harder. I don\u2019t mean to put down the uni I went to, as it is definitely more than possible to make it and be just as fine at IIT, it will just be more effort from a career/job standpoint. Hope that helps",

            "comment": "Social scene and campus life is LITERALLY non existent at IIT. It\u2019s in a sketchy part of town. But Chicago is a wonderful city to live in. CMU has a traditional college experience as it is in decent sized city. Social life is going to be top tier. CMU is ranked the 12th best school for architecture in the US while IIT is ranked 35th. I am not too sure about internship and job opportunities but Chicago will definitely have plenty because it\u2019s a major city. Im not too sure about Pittsburgh. If you want a more traditional college experience at a top architecture school I\u2019d recommend CMU. Personally I wouldn\u2019t consider IIT because it\u2019s in a more \u201csketchy\u201d part of town and campus life is dead.",

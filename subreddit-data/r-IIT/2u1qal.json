    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nTomorrow will be my first day (and every Thursday from now on this semester) where I plan to stay on campus from 0830 to about 2130 due to my three classes and one lab being staggered throughout the day.\n\nI only live about a 10-15 minute bus ride from home, but find it tedious in a way to go home and back when my longest wait is only about two hours.\n\nWhere is the best place to sit back/relax/kill time?  During the day, I usually just set up in the MTCC, but I can see that getting old and was wondering if any of you had any other suggestions other than sitting behind my laptop/waiting it out?\n\nIf there's really nothing worth the time, I guess I can just go home for about 1.5 hours and then come back?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Also try getting into SSV, 5th floor have some nice large lounges and when it's warm you could go out and work on the balconies. Another option off campus is ride the red up to jackson and go to the main brain of the library. That place has all kinds of awesome workspace. I go there just to work and I commute from the burbs. 9th floor is the best there, but often rented out to events because of it's full open space and glass ceiling. ",

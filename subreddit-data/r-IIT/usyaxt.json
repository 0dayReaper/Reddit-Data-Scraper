Will it be easier to commute?\n\n\nEdit: Okay, So I had to turn down the housing because my campus is in downtown and the commute involved me travelling through underground tunnels, which I don\u2019t think Will be safe at night \ud83e\udd72\n\nI need options now, so kindly help me out TIA \u2728",

            "comment": "Hi, mies campus here, I live right off the campus (near the starbucks) and it\u2019s pretty decent. I\u2019ve heard some great things about Bridgeport as well, just when scouting out houses make sure you can\u2019t see the Sox stadium, because right around finals week they shoot off fireworks almost constantly, plus it makes traffic a living hell. Other than that the area is *generally* regarded as safe, and has a super pleasant community. I highly recommend checking out Stix n Bricks cafe for lunch and/or dinner",

Hope that helps!",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm thinking of taking a course in IIT. I'm interested in getting Computer Engineering. I know some of the colleges have different rate/cost per unit of subject and International Student have high cost. For IIT, how much is it per unit?? I tried to look in their website but I cannot find. Also, I'm trying to see how much the cost of the overall programs but can't find it. Can anyone guide me on this one?? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!!",

But I would suggest reaching out to the administration at the school to discuss - either the heads of the department you want to go to or the general school administration.  They'll be able to give you the most accurate information and also be able to answer other questions you might have.",

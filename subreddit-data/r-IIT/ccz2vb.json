    "postText": "I am a student from BITS Pilani and will be graduating in a year. I have my placements next semester and I am hoping I get placed with a good package. However, if I don't get placed with a good package I was thinking to pursue [M.Tech](https://M.Tech) in CSE in IITs. Here are a few things I would like to know (Anyone IITIAN here? Your answer will be very helpful, however, anyone who knows what I need to know, please answer). Also if anyone has any placement statistics of IITs for M Tech in CSE please do share.\n\n1) What is the average and median salaries for people doing M Tech in IITs in CSE?\n\n2) I have heard that some people  5-10 LPA and some get 20-25 LPA? Which one is true? Also, I have heard that many of the M Tech students are fired within a few months after getting hired?\n\n3) Does the M Tech degree from IIT CSE matter more or experience in industry matter more for getting a high paying job?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.\n\nHope you have a nice day!",

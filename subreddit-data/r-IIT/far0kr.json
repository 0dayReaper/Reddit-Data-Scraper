    "postText": "I\u2019m a high school senior (pursuing Civil Engineering) that received the Camras scholarship. IIT was never meant to be my first choice but because the scholarship covers the tuition, it might be more practical for me to go there. I originally really wanted to go to UIUC but they didn\u2019t give me any scholarships at all soooo rip. Aside from that, the only thing that\u2019s discouraging me from being 100% sure about IIT is the social scene. Is it really that bad?\n\nLike say, if I was engaged in a lot of clubs, I\u2019d be able to make friends and all that stuff, right? What about parties? How often do they occur or do they even exist? (I don\u2019t want to join a sorority tho) Surely not everyone is all introverted??\n\nI\u2019m honestly concerned with the diversity of people as well (personality-wise/extrovert or introvert). I\u2019d really love to make friends with different kinds of people but I feel like IIT has people with the same quiet personalities. \n\nSomeone please prove me wrong lol. I was really looking forward to having a good social life in college.",

If the social life was one of your prime requirements for a school, you might want to consider a different university or look at off campus life when you are able to move.",

If you're not going to take advantage of Chicago, it's probably not worth it tho. Campus is pretty boring  so taking advantage of Chicago is a must",

I was an Archie and actually mostly had friends who weren't archies. I thought they were more fun and didn't take their work as seriously. You can join the Greek scene for sure. Definitely get involved in the Student Government because that's where you'll find the most extroverted people! It doesn't have sports or 'tailgating' culture like big 10 schools have, but I was never deprived of a social life. You'll be closer to Chicago and other universities vs being stuck in a cornfield for 4 years. Join a meetup or book club with other people with same interests.",

            "comment": "Congrats on both acceptances. I was in a similar situation when deciding between the two - Camras scholar graduating in 2018 in MechEng.\n\nI ended up choosing IIT largely because of the Camras aid. Many Camras scholars do a choose your own adventure when it comes to academics. A lot of us come with decent amount of  ap credit to help us start off as 2nd yr UG or 2nd sem UG. Some of us speed through the coursework and end up graduating in 3 yrs. Others will take their time by looking into a coterminal degree (masters program without thesis) that takes 5 yrs and which Camras covers the extra year with, or a 2nd bachelors degree etc.\n\nYes - I would say the social scene isn't your typical stereotype, but in my experience, IIT has tons of small circles that you can jump around. There's a decent amount of social events dedicated to Camras scholars ourselves as well. Lot of clubs that exist and fairly easy to set one up on your own if you don't find what you're looking for. I also wouldn't count out greek life - again, IIT's pretty unique, and the greek life is unique as well as opposed to other greek org events I've been to at other schools.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI need to move out of my apartment early and am looking for some to take my spot in the lease. You would get a bedroom and share the rest of the house with two other people. The address is 625 E Groveland Park and your rent would be $660 a month not including internet, gas, and electricity which is divided among the tenants.\n\nPlease you can contact me at: [ddewolf@hawk.iit.edu](mailto:ddewolf@hawk.iit.edu) if you are interested, please use your hawk email to contact me so I know you are a student.\n\nThe place would be available on December 1st.",

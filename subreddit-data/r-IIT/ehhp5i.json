    "postText": "Hello, I am currently a sophomore at IIT.   I have a 4.0 GPA, and am receiving a $25,000 dollars from the Heald scholarship and $4,000 from a housing scholarship.  I was recently caught with alcohol in my dorm by an RA and security guards.  What do you all think my punishment will be?  I have no prior offenses on my record or at IIT.  What are the chances of me losing my scholarships?  Any information is greatly appreciated!",

I believe his punishment was to meet with a member of the administration (in regards to the IIT's policy for alcohol) and be subjected to a year of probation.\n\nYour mileage may obviously vary, but I don't think the administration will go to the extent of withholding your scholarships or granting a suspension, unless you repeat the same offense.",

I got into many colleges in CS(wayne state, UAB, UHCL, SLU) too. Cost is a factor for me. Even after 10k$ scholarship at IIT I'm unable to decide. I'm compromising on course for cost, am I doing a mistake?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/13wlcqs)",

                            "comment": "Let me provide some additional context that u/Successful-Network66 didn't mention. Yes, there are issues when it comes to the campus, It's not great, but It's not that bad.  Campus life isn't good as well, but it's not hard to make friends as long as you have basic social skills, plus you are in Chicago so in my opinion it doesn't really matter since it takes 10min to go downtown with the train. From my experience, and what I've seen from others, is that students that generally enjoy CS/their major KILL IT, and have jobs lined up before graduation, even in the current state of the tech industry. Being in Chicago is definitely a plus, and believe me that companies in Chicago have a lot of respect for IIT grads and connecting with alumni that work in good companies shouldn't be challenging.\n\nStudying a major such as CS at Illinois Tech is definitely a good choice, and the program is better than UIC for instance, which the user I just mentioned talks about even though it has nothing to do with the post, just by looking at some of the classes I can tell that UIC has less rigor, I've met students that transferred to UIC and told me that it's easier, my conclusion is that IIT students are overall stronger (UIC is a good school either way). One negative about CS is that professors can be hit or miss from what I've heard, in AI-related courses, my professors have been pretty good though.\n\nOverall if you do like the major you are studying and hustle at least a little bit, you will do really well in the future. My personal opinion, the individuals that complain about the academics at IIT and the opportunities, are those that don't realize that you need to put in additional effort outside of class, which literally every single student does no matter what school, i.e. they are lazy (a lot of students are unfortunately here). You didn't land at a bad school, it's actually the opposite, just learn in class, pick good professors, use career services to get prepared for professional events, and apply yourself outside of class.\n\nGood luck!",

                            "comment": "Not a great one. Campus is so glum and terrible. No place to sit and study. It's literally just a bunch of small empty buildings with hallways and 2 or 3 cheap chairs in the middle for 6000 people that attend the school. It's more of a high school feel. Besides the aesthetics of the campus, administration is another issue. They will constantly put holds on your account by their error (no fault of the student) and getting them to remove it is a big hassle. They don't pick up the phone or answer emails and when you go in person they say oh we will take care of it and then they don't. This causes you to miss the first few days registration. Teachers are below average to mediocre at least for CS (I can't comment for other majors). I would recommend any place else. The course structure will be the same anywhere you go. At IIT, you just want to finish the class that you have to self learn anyways and go home. There's no desire to stay on campus and study. IIT is very cheap (not for students that pay but when it comes to providing for students). There's no vendors to even eat proper lunch. Everything is IIT owned. There's 1 coffee shop that IIT owns because they are too cheap to hire vendors for food. They try to do everything themselves and hire student workers so that they don't have to pay outside vendors such as subway or any other lunch vendors. There is a Starbucks but that's technically off campus and not even affiliated with the school. Campus life is terrible. UIC is much better in terms of academics and campus. It only makes sense to go here if it's a financial reason. Other than that, run away from this school and don't look back. Also, if you are by chance coming from a different country, why would you want to come to a lower tier school like this. Not worth the money or time.",

Same goes for professors. Find the good ones and get to know them. A couple of my professors landed me some awesome job offers.\n\nFinal advice, based on what the other guy said (I didn't experience this myself), stay on top of your immigration-related administrative stuff. Anything you need to do in terms of OPT, work visas, etc., research then well and get started well in advance.\n\nGood luck!",

Tons of places to sit and talk to friends and study. Professors were great and very helpful at office hours. IIT is a couple of stops from Chinatown and I went there with my friends all the time and loved it. Student orgs were great. I actually met my now wife there thanks to a student org. \n\nSome of what you said were true back then as well. On campus food sucked. It did feel glum at times especially in the winter. That was about it though and it sucks to hear it's gotten worse in the last few years.\n\nI was an international student and it was awesome ROI for me at least doing Aerospace. All my Aero friends went on to top tier Aero companies which allowed me some great industry connections that also landed me a great job. My CS friends all got into either FAANG or big fintech companies in Chicago.",

You will still go through the courses and get a degree.  It's a school and you'll do the work and go through similar courses. It's just not a great experience compared to other schools (facilities, teachers, campus experience, etc.  I was in CS so professors in aerospace engineering dept might be better idk. Administration has definitely gotten worse. You are truly treated like a number there in my opinion. In terms of jobs and internships though, it really doesn't matter where you go. As long as you have the skill to do what's in the interview, it will be fine. Most educational institutions in the USA have the same curriculum.",

I was able to get a job in AI and I must say that the courses in the CS department at IIT not only allowed me to be prepared for interviews, but also be a major contributor from day one without any previous experience at this kind of work.\n\nOne BIG problem at IIT is that there is a considerable amount of lazy people, this is a problem because IIT isn't a top 20 school in CS therefore you have to like CS and put in effort. This is the population of students that complains about IIT from an *academic* perspective, which I assume you fall in.",

                                    "comment": "Wow, okay. You call a portion of the population at IIT lazy without knowing them and question their intelligence. Nice argument. When did I say smart people aren't at the school? Any school you go to there will be smart people. Theres a lot of people that  can't afford college and go places that offer them the best financially. To your other point, even people in Chicago don't know what IIT is at times. I took Ubers to school a lot and they haven't even heard of the school. My primary doctor didn't even know where IIT was.  They all know UIC, UChicago, UIUC. I'm not saying it's a bad school to go to. You still learn and go through similar courses that any school does and get a degree. In my opinion, where you go doesn't matter as much. it's the effort you put in. So why call people lazy and categorize me into that category. Dude, you don't even know me or where I come from. All I'm saying is that any college you go to, you will  learn but don't expect much from the facilities, campus, or administration. There are other institutions in Chicago specifically that offer better and at times for less money depending on the financial package.  Good for you for being a \"major contributor\". That definition is vague. Everyone that has to support themselves or support their families contributes to society one way or another.",

Calling you lazy might have been a reach though, so I apologize. It doesn't matter if an Uber driver or a doctor knows what IIT is, what matters is if a manager at Amazon that is interviewing you knows what it is. The financial side of things is an important factor as you point out, IIT is worth it only if you are on a good scholarship, because it is expensive, although the ROI is quite worth it. Being a major contributor isn't a vague description, I am simply pointing out that I was overprepared for the position. \n\nP.S. Facilities, campus and administration do leave a lot to be desired every now and then, but its not that bad. At the end of the day if I was accepted to a school like Northwestern or UIUC I would go there in a heartbeat, but I am very satisfied with my experience at IIT, at least from a professional standpoint.",

Teachers will max give you a 24-48 hours for late submissions and take 10 percent off each day it's late. After that it's a zero. The only exception is if theirs a traumatic event which requires some type of documentation. All the CS courses I took at this school had this policy or something similar and I have taken the majority of CS classes that they offered. Thanks for retracting your statement about categorizing someone you don't know as lazy. Some of the statements you made before are like saying you received an 80 on the final but if you weren't lazy, you could have gotten a 100 but in reality you studied weeks in advance and did hundreds of practice problems. It's the same exact thing as saying you didn't get a 100 percent because you were too lazy to study that type of problem but in reality it's a combination of time, complexity, nerves, blanking out during the test.   I'll accept the apology and leave it at that since I know what you actually mean. I worked at Microsoft 7 months after graduation and they didn't know what IIT was.   The location isn't in Chicago though but even the interviewer doesn't care what school you went to. And trust me the title of IIT had nothing to do with the job. In fact the interviewer asked me if that was in a suburb area or in Chicago itself before we went into the technical round. They just care about whether  I got the degree and if I was able to do the whiteboard problems given to me. Where I went was irrelevant. Anyways, I know what you meant and can agree with you on some things and I'll just leave it at that.",

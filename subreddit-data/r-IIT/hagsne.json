SSV north has the same style rooms. SSV south has apartments. i think the apartments have a few different sizes but each person gets their own room and an in unit kitchen, laundry is still shared with the rest of the floor.\n\ni lived in SSV north and the rooms are much larger than doubles at most colleges. i thought it was pretty comfortable.",

So if the pictures are of end rooms, they may actually be bigger than what you saw on tour, because that one isn't an end room. People are randomly assigned, though; I just got lucky to get an end room.",

            "comment": "When I was a student I lived at MSV, SSV, and Gunsaulus.\n\nMSV has small standard college dorm rooms, but it's really easy to spend time with your friends since you can leave the doors open and live in close proximity to each other. The bathrooms for each floor were generally nice right after they were cleaned, but were often quickly destroyed by other students, YMMV. There was also a *huge* problem back when I was in MSV (2012-2014) with the fire alarms *frequently* going off every time someone used the microwave incorrectly. I have no idea if they every actually fixed it.\n\nI lived in the part of SSV with two connected rooms and they were reasonably large. We had your own bathroom that's shared with the adjacent room. The shower sucked because there was very little directing water actually down the drain and it got super mildewy. The toilet and shower are also in the same room that's shared by all 4 of you, so schedules will need to be worked out accordingly. Due to the weight and automatic locking system, the doors can't really be left open like they are in MSV, which in combination with the concrete walls really creates a prison feeling. There's also a community kitchen on each floor, but I wouldn't trust anything I cared about to be left in the fridge there.\n\nGunsaulus was byfar the best, it's basically a standard studio apartment. The only real downsides were that the air conditioning was a loud window unit, and, at least when I was there (2014-2016) a lot of rooms didn't give you access to a *working* wired internet connection. That being said, in hindsight, an off campus apartment in Bridgeport may have been the smarter option financially.\n\n-----\n\n\ntl;dr Bridgeport &gt; Gunsaulus (and similar buildings) &gt; MSV &gt; SSV",

            "comment": "We aren't the most well known department, but I can say that we are one of the best in terms of professors.  There's wayyy more resources for struggling students here than other departments; even the \"mean\" professors genuinely work hard to make sure everyone can at least pass.  Talking with students about their experiences with advisors and professors in other departments really opened my eyes to how lucky I got with support.  The classes are absolutely challenging, but the professors are here because they want you to succeed.  As long as you try and don't bs them, you'll find a lot of support if you're struggling.  Being a super small department is another plus; you can get one on one help for your classes very easily, and you'll know basically all your professors after your sophomore year.  The only con I can think of is it is physics so it's a challenging program, and it can be difficult to find research outside of the university if you don't already have experience or are a superstar.  But internal research is plentiful, even for freshman.",

At the beginning I was a little frustrated because I had been accepted to higher tier programs with less financial support, but that went away by my sophomore year. I was accepted into a pretty prestigious internship program that year that meant I would have to take a semester off, and my physics advisor (Prof. L) moved heaven and earth to make sure I could do the program, graduate on time, and not lose my finaid. That program changed the course of my career and put me into contact with some very high level people in the industry, and had I not gone to IIT there\u2019s no way I could\u2019ve done it. The admin people I had talked to weren\u2019t much help, but Prof. L designed an online course for me to make sure I could I had the credits I needed and wouldn\u2019t need to take an extra semester. I\u2019ve done internships and REU\u2019s with people from much more well known programs, and I\u2019ve heard a lot of horror and stress stories that have made me think I would\u2019ve switched majors if I hadn\u2019t had the support from the department. \n\nI know I\u2019m talking it up a lot, but in my opinion this is legitimately one of the best departments to be at in terms of undergrad support. Take it with a grain of salt because this is just one person\u2019s experience, but I know my friends in the department have all had similar support. \n\nI would highly recommend reaching out to some professors if you wanna learn more about research or classes. They all enjoy hearing from prospective students and are more than happy to help.",

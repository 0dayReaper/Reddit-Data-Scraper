    "postText": "I am a prospective visiting student to IIT this summer. I am intending to take the \"Intro to Algorithms\" course. Couple questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. How is the instructor, Lan Yao? I can't find her rateMyProf page.\n2. Generally, how is this course during summer? Any historical grading data (Num of people getting A's, B's...)?\n3. Is there any public archive website where I can query historical grading data?\n4. Does IIT summer course usually have a fixed timeframe for final exam, even if the course is hold online?\n\nThanks guys!",

            "comment": "Yao is a caring and sweet professor, she is willing to help and cares for her students BUT she has an accent and doesn\u2019t always explain things well and people struggle because they misunderstand a concept and feel bad asking her to explain things again. Also summer courses are pretty hard at IIT, recommend u form a study group especially for 430.",

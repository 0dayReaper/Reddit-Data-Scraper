Would you also tell me if you applied to outside/private scholarships? Did you win anything. \n \nThanks. I hope I didn\u2019t make you uncomfortable.",

That\u2019s basically all I got in scholarships. \n\n(2) Nope\n\nIf you plan on applying to IIT, I urge that you apply before early action, as a lot of scholarships are only given if you apply Early Action/Decision. I made that mistake and could have saved myself thousands of dollars per year, but was lazy and decided to apply late. Worst decision ever.",

    "postText": "You can be as blunt or as honest as you want :) I'll start!\n\nI have a couple (yes, sorry, I couldn't choose):\n\n1. There is a very wide range of people from all over the world, and many are open to sharing their culture with you if you're open to learning.. which is really cool\n\n2. Change is a very known word around campus, and if you want to make something better, there's a good chance you can make it happen if you get the right people on board!\n\n3. The city is super close and amazing\n\n4. Our sustainability program is growing incredibly fast, with lots of potential.\n\n5. There's a lot of guys on campus (hey, for a girl, this is nice). Some may be nerdy, some might be mean, and some might not be interested... but when you find a really good looking dude, you know he's going to be smart! ;)\n\n6. I know my advisor and past teachers really well, and can stop by to say hi whenever! I LOVE THIS!",

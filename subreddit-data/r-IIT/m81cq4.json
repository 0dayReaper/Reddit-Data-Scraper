    "postText": "Hi, I am not an alum but I have a family member who is, and I got a text addressed to that family member claiming to be an Illinois Tech student saying that IIT is \u201cchecking in on many of our alumni to see if we can help them in anyway\u201d and asking me to verify that this is a good number to reach the alum. \nI have no idea where they got my number and this feels like a scam to me! I googled the person\u2019s name and they appear to be an IIT student, but I\u2019m also worried that someone is using the student\u2019s name without their knowledge. Not sure what to do here\u2014does anyone know if this is legitimate?",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm planning to pursue a BS in CS program starting Fall 2021, for which I will be applying this coming Fall. I suffer from a mild case of Dyslexia and ADHD, although I am good at academics. Can you please tell me about the CS major at IIT and how manageable it in general? Thanks.",

            "comment": "I'm only starting my third year so I can only speak on my experience so far, but I would say CS is pretty manageable. It doesn't require as much textbook reading as some engineering majors do, but it will require a lot of practice and individual studying. Most of the faculty is pretty good, but there are a few classes with notoriously difficult profs (making friends in these classes is key!). If you've already practiced coding with dyslexia then you'll know how difficult that will be, but I can't say if it will be much harder with ADHD. Good luck, and hopefully some others will be able to provide some other advice.",

First two years\u2019 of courses are interesting and super manageable, but some of the 400-level courses (CS 450, CS 440, etc.) can be tough. Some professors are known to give a ton of work and not explain anything well at all, and others are just amazing resources for the course. Overall, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it - it\u2019s a very fair program and you\u2019ll do great!",

Some extra tips are go to every class, start projects early, and work with groups of students. The last part helped me immensely to get through IIT and make a bunch of friends along the way.",

You can contact the disability office for more info.",

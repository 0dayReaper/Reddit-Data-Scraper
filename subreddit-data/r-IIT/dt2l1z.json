                    "comment": "Hmmm, I didn't make it with the intention of other colleges using it, but it should actually be pretty easy, you just need to modify 2 things:\n\n1. The classes folder needs to contain all of the class information in a JSON file. I made a helper script that generates these automatically for my school, so I would recommend figuring out how to do that for your school. The general structure is:\n\n```json\n\n    {\n        \"Teacher1\": {\n            \"UniqueClassID(CRN)\": {\n                \"name\": \"Class Name\",\n                \"crn\": \"UniqueClassID(CRN)\",\n                \"course\": \"CLS 100\",\n                \"section\": \"01\",\n                \"link\": \"Link1\",\n                \"term\": \"Spring 2020\",\n                \"type\": \"Lecture\",\n                \"instructional_method\": \"Traditional Instructional Method\",\n                \"credits\": 3,\n                \"catalog\": \"Link2\",\n                \"instructors\": [\"Array\", \"Of\", \"Teachers\"],\n                \"classes\": {\n                    \"T\": {\n                        \"start\": 915,\n                        \"end\": 990,\n                        \"location\": \"Classroom 123\"\n                    },\n                    \"R\": {\n                        \"start\": 915,\n                        \"end\": 990,\n                        \"location\": \"Classroom 123\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n2. Edit the `classes.json` file to contain all of the **course** names. In the class above, this was `CLS 100`.\n\nThose two changes alone should make everything work!",

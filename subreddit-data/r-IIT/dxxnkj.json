In the application portal, it says I can longer submit my application since the deadline is passed. Is that it? My dream of attending this school is over? Someone Help!",

Worth at least shooting your shot and calling up Graduate Admissions a.s.a.p. (9-5 C.S.T. tomorrow)",

Graduate admissions uses TargetX's Recruitment Suite, according to the online app's URL. I tried using the customer support chat option on TargetX's website to get clarification on whether the info/recommendations/etc.'s retained when an app is re-opened, but nobody messaged me back :( I'd suggest digging around online, if you're against just waiting it out 'till you can call tomorrow and find out",

            "comment": "Full text, in case it throws you to a paywall the 2nd time you visit:\n\n&gt;Illinois Institute of Technology President John Anderson is ready to ditch the low profile he has kept for the past six years\u2014now that he finally has something to talk about. \n&gt;\n&gt;There's the $250 million capital campaign\u2014the university's first major fundraiser in nearly 20 years\u2014that is more than halfway toward its goal. There are plans for a five-story innovation center, the first new building in a decade on IIT's main campus. And he has hired a new chief financial officer and a new provost, and replaced three of the school's eight deans, recently adding Dutch architect Wiel Arets as head of the architecture school. \n&gt;\n&gt;Now, administrators say they want to increase undergraduate enrollment by at least 20 percent over the next five years to more than 3,300. At the same time, they hope to lift the school's national ranking from No. 113 on the U.S. News &amp; World Report list and compete for students with Carnegie Mellon University (No. 23), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (No. 46) and Purdue University (No. 65). \n&gt;\n&gt;While the bulk of IIT's undergraduate class comes from Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan, administrators realize the school needs to draw from both coasts to gain national attention. (That's not a problem for the graduate programs, where the bulk of students come from outside the United States.) IIT also is bulking up its sports program\u2014joining the NCAA and adding women's lacrosse\u2014as well as honing marketing materials and increasing outreach to high school guidance counselors.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;John Anderson\n&gt;The proposed 100,000-square-foot innovation center will house classrooms and labs to help students create their own businesses and give startups access to academic research. A groundbreaking has yet to be scheduled. \n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cI think IIT could be, to paraphrase a musical, the very model of a professional school,\u201d says John Rowe, chairman of IIT's board of trustees and former CEO of Chicago-based Exelon Corp. \u201cNot in less than 10 years, though.\u201d \n&gt;\n&gt;There wasn't much to brag about when Mr. Anderson, 67, became the university's eighth president in 2007. Undergraduate enrollment was down 16.6 percent from its peak of 3,094 students in 1983. The then-$338 million endowment shrank as the private school continued to use the reserve to help pay for expenses, a decadelong practice that finally stopped last year. Its credit was poor after decades of heavy borrowing and little revenue growth. \n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cThe first year was one of the toughest years of my life,\u201d says Mr. Anderson, who joined IIT from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, where he was provost. \u201cIt was frustrating inheriting a negative budget and a negative debt rating.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;SHAKE-UP\n&gt;\n&gt;He took two years to hire key administrators and deans, recruiting heavily from Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon, where he had spent nearly 30 years, including a stint as dean of the engineering school. He took an unpopular stance to managing IIT's expenses by freezing salaries for a couple of years and limiting tenure grants and promotions. Mr. Anderson even cut the basketball program, which will be restored this year. \n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cI bet everybody would like to have a bigger raise and everybody would like a new computer and everybody would like a new comfy chair,\u201d says John Snapper, associate professor of philosophy and chairman of the faculty council. \u201cMy base salary is $70,000, and that's considered shockingly low.\u201d On the other hand, he says, \u201cI think people are pleased with the shake-up. From a faculty point of view, he gave us a bunch of deans that we like to work with.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt; Mr. Anderson won't publicly share fundraising goals for scholarships or new endowed professorships after failing to meet his self-imposed goal of doubling IIT's endowment to $600 million by 2014. The current endowment stands at $203 million. He is, however, winning praise for delaying a major capital campaign until he was able to hire key academic leaders and balance the budget. \n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cThe worst thing is to bring a lot of attention to a bad product,\u201d says Rob Moore, president and CEO of branding firm Lipman Hearne Inc. in Chicago, which consults for universities among other clients. \u201cThat will sink it quicker than letting it die slowly.\u201d \n&gt;\n&gt;Not every idea from Mr. Anderson's team was a winner; there was a fleeting suggestion to rename the school to emphasize its ambitions to be a leader in science and technology education. \n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cWhen I came, I thought the answer was to make it Illinois Tech,\u201d says Alan Cramb, IIT's provost. \u201cIt took me a while to realize that doesn't work for the architecture school or law school or business school.\u201d \n&gt;\n&gt;The to-do list is far from complete. Mr. Anderson badly wants to renovate two dormitories built in the 1950s, but borrowing millions to do so would further damage the school's debt rating. Moody's Investors Service Inc. has a negative outlook on IIT's $232 million of outstanding debt because of its \u201cvery thin liquidity.\u201d \n&gt;\n&gt;That project and more, Mr. Anderson says, are for the next strategic plan.",

I'm not sure if you're aware but apparently the foundation of the building started shifting and after an inspection was considered unsafe to occupy. The shifting is believed (by those I spoke with) to have been caused by the construction that was done on the Metra line several years ago. The cost of repairing the foundation was deemed to be too expensive by the administration and other costs took priority.",

This school will not increase its enrollment without first taking care of these essential resources. Kid's who see a school with nice dorms, a strong greek system, and successful athletics are way more likely to attend.",

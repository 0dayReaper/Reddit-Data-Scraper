    "postText": "The nonprofit I work for is hosting a free Frog Call Monitoring class in February in Lincoln Park as part of our Biodiversity Program. This is part of an effort to get volunteers to become citizen scientists and active in biodiversity.\n\nWhat's involved: 1) Participate in the Monitoring class Saturday, February 20 from 10am-12:30pm in Lincoln Park. 2) Learn and memorize to the best of your ability the frog calls on the CD we give you. 3) For monitoring, you\u2019ll need to identify a location near water and 5 listening points at that location. You\u2019ll need to record air temperature, wind speed, GPS location, etc. Monitoring takes place at dusk, so choose a safe, comfortable location and, if you\u2019d like, bring a fellow monitor or friend. Visit your location at least 3 times: once between March 1-April 20, again between May 10-May 30, and again between June 20-July 10. 4) Upload all your data into the frog monitoring website, or return it to us, so we can use the information you worked so hard to get.\n\n[Our Website](http://lincolnparkconservancy.org/)\n\n[Flyer](http://i.imgur.com/CyJwg0V.png)\n\nPM me here or contact the e-mail on the flyer if you have any questions.\n\nThanks and stay warm out there!",

Personally speaking as a queer and trans person on campus, in general IIT is super accepting. You\u2019ll have the occasional classmate or professor who isn\u2019t, but they\u2019ve never been too big of a problem for me, even while I was still in a versions obvious transition on campus. \n\nThere is gender neutral housing, however we\u2019re not entirely sure the extent of it since there\u2019s a new housing form and they haven\u2019t said how much of it will be gender neutral yet. The housing department has been working a lot with Prism and SGA (student government) to get those implemented and improved for this upcoming school year. \n\nAlso, feel free to send me a message or reddit chat if you\u2019d like to hear more in a bit more private situation.",

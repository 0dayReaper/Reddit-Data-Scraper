    "postText": "I\u2019ve been admitted to both UIC and IIT\u2019s psych program and I\u2019m curious to know your thoughts/opinions as to which is better. In the future, I would like to have a medical profession similar to a physician\u2019s assistant. I really enjoy the research part of psychology and that\u2019s why I\u2019m leaning more towards IIT, but UIC also has good things to offer.",

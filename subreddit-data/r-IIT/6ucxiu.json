    "postText": "Hi, I'm going to be starting my freshman year soon, and I was wondering if there are any sort of free student services that the school provides that I might not know about. Things like free printing or free movies at x theater, or other stuff like that.\n\nAlso, if you have any other advice for an incoming freshman, I'd really appreciate it. Like actual advice on things I wouldn't have any way of knowing about. Not really looking for advice like \"take your classes seriously\" or \"join a club to meet new people\" or something like that. This advice is already all over the internet and easily accessible. But something that only an experienced student would know. Thanks :)",

I can give you tips in CS or similar majors since that's my area of expertise. ",

    "postText": "Hi, everyone, \n\nI've received an admit from IIT(Mies Campus) and am considering joining from Fall 2023. I will be moving to a new city and country for the first time. I'm trying to get an idea of what the living expenses are so I can budget accordingly.\n\nI'm interested in the following expenses for one person:\n\n* Rent\n* Food\n* Transportation\n\nHow much do on-campus jobs generally pay/month and how hard is it to get them?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

Living off campus (or on-campus apartment and you provide/cook your own food) would likely be cheaper but budgeting for the school-provided services would give you a conservative number.\n\nI can not really help with travel costs.  That depends on where to and from you plan to travel and how frequently",

Some students shared 3 bedroom apartments with 3-5 people and their rent costs were about 4-500. All those places were 15-20 minutes walk from campus. \n\nI spent about 2-300/mo on food (grocery only, I didn\u2019t go to restaurants). I didn\u2019t have any transport costs because IIT provided a transit pass (paid for in tuition) and I used it to take the bus/train for shopping and weekend fun.",

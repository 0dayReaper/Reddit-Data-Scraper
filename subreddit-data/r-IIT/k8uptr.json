I was looking at Tailor lofts &amp;&amp; saw the rent is like $1600 for a studio. Where do most grad students live because I feel like that\u2019s super high!!??",

South loop is a good place for IIT students, much safer but a quick 7 min train ride. Just get roommates cuz it\u2019s pricy, but still you could easily find a 2/3 bed apt for less than 1600 for your rent share in South Loop.",

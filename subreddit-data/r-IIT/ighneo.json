After posting this thread, I contacted their admissions office and found out that they made a mistake - they seemed to think that I failed to submit my professional statement. Luckily, I had proof that I did (I left nothing blank in my app) and have received my admission letter this morning! I am planning to defer to Spring 2021 since the classes for the Fall semester have already started.",

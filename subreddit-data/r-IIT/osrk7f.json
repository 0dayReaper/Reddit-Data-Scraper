Nothing any CS major is doing is really requiring tons of power, the biggest thing you\u2019ll want it easily being able to carry it to class and take notes on it. \n\nFor languages, it\u2019s all over the place. 115/116/201 are all Java, 331 is usually (but not always) python, 351/450 are C, and everything is generally whatever the professor wants. If you\u2019re doing a class that requires some special tools (like matlab or something) or power, you\u2019ll be given resources on campus and online to use them, like the virtual computer lab, an actual computer lab, or a remote server you can connect to.",

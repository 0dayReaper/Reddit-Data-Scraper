    "postText": "Former IIT student here. Had some luck posting in /r/Chicago so I figured why not post in some college subreddits!\n\nI'm a licensed cosmetologist in the advanced training program at Tailor Men's Salon in Wicker Park/East Village looking for guys to come in for training days on Tuesdays and Thursdays for a free haircut!\n\nModels will receive a full consultation, shampoo, cut, rinse, and style for free. The only catch I will say is that you may be sitting there for an hour to an hour and a half because it is a training where I will be critiqued by a lead educator and corrected throughout the service. This is not a \"take what we give you \" haircut, there is flexibility discussed within the consultation based on your needs and what you like.\n\nSo far I've had some great success with having folks post to a Google doc spreadsheet to schedule yourself in with an email/reddit username. You can find that link [here!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fd1jJXlGwvDkO_izyvxoQGpReq1MqDxFHj7RLWOdD2c/edit#gid=0)\n\n\nFor any further questions, feel free to shoot me an email at foxthebarber@gmail.com\n\n\nThanks guys!\n\n",

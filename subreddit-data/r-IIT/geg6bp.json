Got any cool tips you'd like to share? \n\nI'm eager to hear from you all, and I hope this thread goes on for a while to help out all the other incoming undergrads. \n\nHave a good one, and thanks in advance.",

            "comment": "I've had a great time at IIT so far! I've met some great friends, had some really fun experiences, and learned a lot in the last 2 years. \n\nAs far as my advice and tips for a new undergrad, I'll say this. Try to meet as many people and be social during welcome week (provided it's not cancelled by corona), I met a lot of great people during this time and it made the first few semesters of classes way better because I knew some people already. If you have to, literally just ask a group if you could sit with them, 99% of the time they'll say yes and you could meet some lifelong friends (this is actually how I met all my really close friends, just happened to sit with them one day). \n\nAnother tip is to take advantage of Chicago. It's a great city with a lot to offer, but you won't see much of it from campus. So take advantage of your free CTA transportation and explore the city (also very fun with friends!). Some places I recommend are Chinatown, museum island, downtown, Navy Pier, Logan park, and wicker park. Also there are a lot of free events in the summer (again, maybe not rn due to corona) so take advantage of those too! Oh, and the union board also gives out a lot of super cheap tickets to stuff during the semester. Follow their insta page to find about about this stuff, I've been on a helicopter tour and done indoor skydiving for only $15!\n\nFinally, join some student orgs and get involved in campus. A lot of people complain about a lack of campus life, but those people also rarely join orgs or try to find any sort of campus life at all! The bog is a lot of fun too (free bowling!).\n\nHope this helps get you and any other freshmen excited for your first semester, good luck and stay safe until then!",

            "comment": "Hi there; welcome to IIT! I'm a MechE co-term; so far some of the most valuable experiences have been my time in extracurriculars. IIT can provide lots of financial support directly to clubs, allowing you to focus on personal and club development rather than fundraising. Project based orgs can be time consuming but extremely educational and fulfilling. Greek life orgs at IIT generally defy the stereotype; because most people are school focused in hard majors, they become an awesome support network.\n\nThere are lots of undergrad research opportunities at IIT (even by sophomore year). Take advantage of those (sometimes they find you, sometimes you just email a professor doing cool stuff and ask if you can help), and you'll learn a ton and have good experiences to speak about when interviewing for jobs.",

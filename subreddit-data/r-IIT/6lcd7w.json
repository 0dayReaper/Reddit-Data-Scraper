Unless things have changed you will be forced to purchase a U-Pass when you start in August. It's awesome, unlimited CTA rides on the L and busses. \n\nJump on the Red Line and head north 1 stop and you will be at Chinatown. \n\nOr jump on the Green Line and head north 1 stop and you will be at the Roosevelt stop. Meander south through the booming South Loop, or North into the city or west towards all the new shopping places or east to the Museum Campus where you can visit many of the famous museums in Chicago.

You can usually feed two people with a single order.",

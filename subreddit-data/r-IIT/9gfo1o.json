    "postText": "Every time I walk around the lobby or some other areas some group is always playing D&amp;D. It seems that if there was a club based on my limited understanding of the system they would get some sort of funding which could be cool for making campaigns more fun, and it would bring more members to play together. \n\nI know that where one of my friends goes to college they have a d&amp;d club that meets over the weekend and they play a campaign with 5-7 members per table. And they play in the same world just different regions.\n\nDo people think that would sound fun, and would people be interested in joining a club like that. ",

You might be able to start one up if you get enough demand. I'd go around asking people and stuff since this subreddit is basically a ghost town. Hopefully since social gaming club isn't around anymore, hopefully you can easily form the club, although if you don't initially succeed, maybe make the club broader, more general tabletop games, rather than just D&amp;D and similar systems. Best of luck!",

I don't know how big IIT's D&amp;D community is, but I know some people in ITR have their own private campaign going on.\n\nI've got no clue how late you can form a club so you may have to be unofficial this semester if you decide to go through with it.\n\nShoot me a PM if you need any help.",

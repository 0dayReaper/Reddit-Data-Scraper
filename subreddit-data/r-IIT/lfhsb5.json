    "postText": "I was accepted for Fall 2021 freshman entry but have a large amount of community college credits (out of state). I know they take up to like 60 something credits, but are they picky about the classes they take? I am graduating with an associates degree but have to get my transcript eval as a freshman. Can anyone speak to their experiences transferring in classes from another institution? I\u2019m not too worried about things like Chem 1, but I want to make sure my more specific IT courses like Network Security will transfer over.",

The IIT website says \u201ca maximum of 68 applicable credit hours is transferable from a two-year institution.\u201d Does 1:1 just mean that it\u2019ll replace one of my degree requirements?",

So like when I take it, the first half of the semester will be review, so that credit didn't really help.\n\nBut as long as IIT offers a matching course, you will get full credit for it.",

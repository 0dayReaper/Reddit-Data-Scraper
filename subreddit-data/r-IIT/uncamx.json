            "comment": "I attended IIT for the past two years as a Computer Engineering major. I'm transferring out this semester.\n\nI hated my time here. There are a few decent ECE professors but there are some that are just godawful. I took ECE 311 last semester and literally no one understood the course material. The average on the final was probably like a 40% and the class got curved super hard. Pretty much everyone I knew Chegged the homework assignments (and the professor didn't even care) and copied answers from exams in previous years. Most of the labs are also extremely annoying and tedious and most students just BS the labs and get passing grades.\n\nI am personally very interested in ECE as a major but I felt like I barely learned anything about it from this school.\n\nAlso, the social life here is atrocious. Every year, IIT consistently gets ranked as one of the [top 10 unhappiest schools in the whole country](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-10-colleges-with-the-_n_1116156). I started to have severe depression and suicidal thoughts because of how lonely I felt.\n\nSo please do yourself a favor and do not come here. If you can get into UIUC you should absolutely go there instead. If not, then I would recommend UIC as it's ranked very similarly to IIT and it's a much larger school (which is a very good thing as you will get more options for classes) and much more social. It has plenty of other advantages like being in a much nicer location and having larger career fairs.",

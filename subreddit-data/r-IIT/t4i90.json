I realized pretty quickly I don't feel comfortable walking over there at night, though other people will swear on its safety. Personally, I'd suggest South Loop. Craigslist usually has roommate wanted ads with prices comparable and usually a couple hundred less than campus per month. The nice thing about high rises as well is that utilities are usually included and sometimes (especially with gas and heat/ac) unlimited :)",

    "postText": "Hi there! I'm a 4th year Mechanical Engineering student at UC Davis right now, and I'm considering IIT for grad school in Design. I'm going to be in Chicago soon, and have very few plans from Friday the 3rd until Tuesday the 7th. If someone's willing to show me around campus or the city in general, I'd really love it. My current plan is to just sort of explore on my own, but it seems a lot more fun to go with someone who knows the area. I don't really care what your major is or anything, I'm more interested in meeting some people, finding out what campus life is like, and having a good time. Any takers?",

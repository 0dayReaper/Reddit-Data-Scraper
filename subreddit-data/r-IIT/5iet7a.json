My goal if I were to attend grad school is to get my shit together basically and land a better job. Just want to make up for what I didn't do during my years in undergrad. The reason I am considering coming here in the future is because I live nearby haha.\n\niS there any Formula SAE or any design teams or research programs here? If so how are they.\n\n\nYes I have looked up on the internet already. Just asking how are they?\n",

I was just going to find another job, and then go back to school.\n\nWhat are your suggestions?? Right now the way my resume looks, I am not getting desirable jobs(due to lack of experience, lack of joining clubs in college, etc)), and I don't wanna be a downer here, but I am learning my lesson lol. Dont screw up bachelors I always tell others this, because if you do you wont really be getting these jobs at these desirable industires or whatever....idk thats how i feel about it.",

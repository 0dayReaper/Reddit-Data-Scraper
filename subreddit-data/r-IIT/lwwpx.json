But I was smart and prior to landing this job, I made sure to apply to a wide variety of options (peace corps, teaching math/science abroad, research, etc), that way if one opportunity failed (as research did), there's always a backup.  Spending a little time doing something different will only expand your mind. \n\nHowever! I did have friends that suffered - civil engineers and architects for example.  There was no market for construction, so all hiring ceased.  Many of them went back to school or got some coffee shop job.  \n\nMy suggestion is to keep your eyes, ears and options open, try a variety of sources, and most definitely talk to head hunters!  The first job out of college doesn't have to be your dream job.",

The rest of the answer is very well put as well.\n\nYou increase your chances every time you learn a new field-relevant skill on your own, every time you do a field-relevant 'hobby' project, every time you have a real (not LinkedIn) connection at some company, every time you show interest in something and have physical proof of that. Everything you do outside of class is probably more important to getting a job than focusing only on lectures and homework. The rest of your chances hang on luck and circumstance. Make honest connections with peers, try to impress those who offer jobs, and then cross your fingers.",

BME's get a very broad range of skills and only touch once on everything, without getting a whole lot out.  Halfway thru, I decided the EE part would give me some more tangible skills (which really boosted my resume), and if I failed to get a job as a BME, then EE was promising.  \n\nI also felt that minors were useless, and although the double was an Incredible amount of work, I have a solid degree to be proud of (in fact, I have two), and a strong work ethic. \n\nGood luck to ya!

It's super laid back, I can come and go as I please, wear what I want, take days off on a whim, get paid more than I could have ever wished for, and Damn, time? What's that? I finally have some to do Fun things when I'm not working (unlike school).   \n\nAlthough I spend my day on a computer, my job is incredibly stimulating.  Then I get to bike ride home, go rock climbing, stop at the gym, do some yoga, and come back to work thankful that I have a desk job! Something I learned recently is that you don't need to find all your happiness in one place.  A little here, little there and life is good. :)",

IIT is going to be in the top colleges for decisions so I really wan to know what it\u2019s like there. \n\nWhat are some of the biggest positives and negatives IIT has?\n\nWhat is student life like at IIT?\n\nHow tough are classes and how easy is it to make friends?\n\nAny information is appreciated and welcome.",

It\u2019s quite the introverted campus.    \nStudent life isn\u2019t entirely dead, but if a thriving student life is a must-have for you then IIT probably isn\u2019t the best option.",

I don't recommend going at sticker price. \n\n\nEngineering is a tough track but CAE is one of the easier departments. There's social life if you can find it. At least when I was there there's a good number of things to do on weekends around campus and in the city. Make friends at other city schools like UIC or DePaul  to expand your options if that's what you're looking for.. Overall I thought they prep you well for the profession and give you opportunities for internships and research. A good amount of my classmates were able to secure good paying work out of school. \n\nDownside is it's a relatively unknown school nationally so it doesn't carry any prestige if you plan to work out of town or outside engineering.",

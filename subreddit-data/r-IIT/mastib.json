            "comment": "I have not taken all of the courses on that list, so I can only say from personal experience for some of them. For the first set, I've taken CS525, CS546, and CS553. Of those, CS525 might be the easiest, if you have a good team to work on the assignments with. The exams are difficult, but they follow the same format each year, so they are straightforward to study for. If you don't have friends to be your teammates, CS553 will probably be the easiest. All three are quite programming assignment heavy.\n\nFor the second set, I've taken CS542  and CS550. CS550 is a really cool class, but CS542 is definitely much easier. If you take it with Dr. Chlebus, there is no programming, simply two written assignments and two exams. CS550 with Dr. Lan requires a lot of programming.\n\nFor the the third set, I've only taken CS536 because I am really not a serious CS theory person. I will say that I found CS536 the most baffling and useless class I've ever taken. I have not met a single person who would call this class easy. Hope this helps!",

I am in the process of selecting courses for my first semester and I wish to take ML courses so I am planning to take courses according to that. Just hoped to get an insight on which courses you took and how you found them, if possible... any insight or advice about courses, professors will be welcome!",

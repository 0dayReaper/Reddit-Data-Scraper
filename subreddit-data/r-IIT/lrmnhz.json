    "postText": "Incoming Fall '21 grad student for Computer Engineering, now planning tentative schedules based on previous semesters' course availabilities. One of the core courses for my degree is CS 551, and while it is listed in the academic catalog I cannot find the course in Blackboard after the Fall 2018 term nor can I find any faculty listed as having taught that course after that term. I had a bad experience with \"weirdly scheduled\" courses during my undergrad, so I want to make sure I don't miss anything here.\n\nI contacted my faculty mentor with a question about the course's availability, then after a week I contacted the CS grad office with the same question, and another week has passed since then with no response from anyone. Does anyone here have any information about this course and its scheduling?",

I can't comment on the CS department specifically. You'll definitely need to keep advocating for yourself and pushing through the problem.",

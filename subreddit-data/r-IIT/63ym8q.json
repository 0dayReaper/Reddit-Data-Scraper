    "postText": "I am a graduate in Genetics from Penn State University. I have gotten into Illinois Institute of Technology in the MS in Data Science. What will the job prospects like? I hope to get a role of biological data scientist. I have also gotten into UIUC in Information Management, which isn't as rigorous a course as the one at IIT. It seems like I am steering blind right now, so any help will be much appreciated!",

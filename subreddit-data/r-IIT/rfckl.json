On the wikipedia page for him, you'd have to scroll down to the bottom to see some of his buildings, and crown hall is down there. The point I'm making is that they chose that certain building, great, to celebrate his birthday but there wasn't really anything related to what the building in the doodle was. A link to the school where the building is, or even the name of the building wasn't there. ",

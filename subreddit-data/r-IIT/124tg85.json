The email I received informed me that the deadline to accept the scholarship is April 1 and the deadline to submit my enrollment deposit is May 1. \n\nI am unclear if I am committing/binded to Illinois Tech if I accept the scholarship. I emailed undergraduate admissions, but their response didn\u2019t clearly answer question. Does anyone know the answer?",

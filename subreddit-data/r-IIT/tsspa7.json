            "comment": "Gregory Pulliam is a super nice guy. I had him for COM309 pre-covid and it was a pretty easy class. He did require attendance somewhat strictly so that is something to consider. The homework was mainly short readings and maybe 2 papers total.",

            "comment": "Gregory Pulliam is great! He really tries to encourage natural discussion in his courses, so be prepared to speak up during lecture. HW and papers are graded leniently, but you typically have to prepare a short discussion point about the readings before class.",

It was basically an asynchronous class with the occasional Zoom meeting together once every few weeks to discuss the homework. She is pretty laid back overall and would say it\u2019s an easy A as long as you do the homework and readings. The exams can be challenging if you haven\u2019t done the readings or homework because she doesn\u2019t give you very much time.",

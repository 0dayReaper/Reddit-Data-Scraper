    "postText": "Hey everyone! I am considering Illinois Tech to get my graduate degree in CS. I want to build my research profile which is non existent so far. Is this university a good choice for that? The research groups are limited according to the website and so are the papers published by faculty. I don't have any research experience so I probably won't be getting into any fancy grad schools so my options are kinda limited. Are the faculties supportive? Do we get good resources? Do people here get opportunities to go into industrial research? All insights are welcome. Thanks!",

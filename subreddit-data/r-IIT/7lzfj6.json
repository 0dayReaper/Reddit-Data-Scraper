Want to go to a school with a good campus life and cool people outside of class? Maybe look somewhere else. \n\nIIT prides itself on its academics, but the campus experience is easily the worst I\u2019ve ever experienced. It\u2019s an architecture school yet it has some of the ugliest building designs you\u2019ll ever see. The volleyball court is an eyesore; I feel like I\u2019ll get ringworm just by looking at it. They\u2019ve shut down most of the historic buildings and chose to keep the buildings that look like tin cans open. It\u2019s in an extremely unsafe and secluded part of Chicago, so you\u2019ll have to keep to certain areas. There are virtually 0 restaurants in walking distance of the school, so good luck finding some place to eat outside the cafeteria. The cafeteria is awful, btw. It\u2019s what I imagine prison food is like, and I\u2019ve never met someone who thought it was good. There\u2019s only one dining hall despite other schools having multiple. The dorms are also equally shitty; MSV (the cheapest dorming option) could easily be confused for a crack house. Most hallways there have a distinct smell, and rooms are extremely small; not much bigger than a walk in closet. SSV isn\u2019t much better; it looks and feels like it was designed as an achitecture experiment rather than a place for a students who miss home to live. The walls are cold concrete, and rooms are designed in a way that discourages being social. It\u2019s also expensive, and the crappy dorming scholarship won\u2019t work there. Did I mention that it\u2019s a private school, so tuition is really expensive? $40,000 per year yet schools like Loyola have a similar tuition and are a million times better in terms of campus life? It really makes you wonder where all the tuition money goes.\n\nIf you live in Illinois, I implore you to consider UIC if you want to save money. Almost everyone I know who went there didn\u2019t take loans out at all. Or just go visit these campuses. Even if it\u2019s just Google Maps street view, you\u2019ll see what I mean. I feel like I\u2019m missing out on a crucial part of my youth because I chose to go here. ",

If you take the Red Line to 63rd (Englewood), the atmosphere is *very* different.  I also wouldn't call it secluded, since we're between two L lines.  It takes a long time to get up to Logan Square or whatever, but downtown is pretty accessible.  Up in the northwest side, between the blue and green lines, it's a lot harder to get anywhere.\n\nBut I agree that campus is pretty shitty.  I'm moving off campus to Bridgeport next year, and I think that'll make my experience a lot nicer (and cheaper).",

(I've visited friends at at least 5 other schools and took many a campus tour before I came here a few years ago) The neighborhood isn't \"extremely unsafe\"....thats laughable. It's right on 2 rail lines so it isn't \"secluded\" We often go to China town to eat (takes a few minutes) or go downtown (takes all of 10-15 minutes). \nSounds like you're bitter about something, but your expereince isn't mine or that of any of my friends here.\n\n",

All of the architecture feats look like design experiments, not spaces for college students. Take the massive staircase near global grounds in MTCC; sure, it may look interesting, but it\u2019s extremely impractical. This massive stairwell takes up so much room, and during the lunch rush their often isn\u2019t enough room for everyone as a result. \n\nTo address your \u201c90% of rooms are are as small as MSV\u201d comment; I went to UIUC for a year and there worst dorms were bigger than IITs. I haven\u2019t actually gone through the measurements but just about every other in state school I visited had larger freshman dorms. And the more often than not had dining halls *inside the dorm*. And it\u2019s funny how you ignore pretty much all my other criticisms of MSV. The pipes running through the walls and strange smells are unignorable. \n\nNot extremely unsafe...I don\u2019t know what to say. Did you not get the email last week of the 7/11 in MTCC getting robbed?\n\nHaving to take a train to go anywhere interesting is a problem of itself. UIC has Chick Fil A, Panda Express, several some local restaurants etc. all in walking distance. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re getting downtown in 15 minutes. It\u2019s like a 5 minute walk to the green line from MSV, waiting for the train for about 8 minutes, sitting on the train for 20 minutes, and then walking to wherever your destination is. It could easily take an hour if the place you\u2019re looking for isn\u2019t near the train.  \n\n\nAnd I am bitter. Like I said, I went to UIUC for a year, so it\u2019s not like I want to switch schools again. Going to another university really helped me see what a good campus life is like. I\u2019m upset IIT\u2019s is so bad. ",

IIT isn't a larger school and it's setup is VERY typical for a school its size. Personally I LOVE the architecture, I think your dislike comes from that bitterness you admit to. \nAs far as the smells, honestly I think you are looking for issues. IIT isn't a party school and doesn't have nearly the long term baked in puke smells that a lot of dorms have (yeh I'm looking at you Ohio State).  And yeh, Pipes run through the walls on every dorm building, thats how plumbing works. \nThe most important thing to remember is Campus Life is whate YOU make it.

Camras, University (35k/year), and probably Duchossois scholarships have a thing called Scholarship Weekend where you interview for them. Note that you need to apply by the priority deadline (whenever it is) for that.\n\nI don't think specific criteria for the merit scholarships is available anywhere. I got Camras with a 35 ACT, shitty GPA like 3.6 or 3.8, and decent extracurriculars of robotics and tech stuff. This sub is pretty quiet, but you might have some more responses trickle in.",

I forget when scholarship weekend is, so you might have a chance at one of the big ones.\n\nPersonally I'd explore other options. IIT is nice enough but it's not a superb school - if your parents make a lot of money (I get 0 need-based aid at $90k parent income) or if you think you'll have trouble getting loans (e.g. parents who don't want to co-sign), I'd look at some other schools. It'd be shitty to pay a lot to go here. IIT is also pretty lax with transfer credits, so you could look into going to community college for two years. It sounds like a death sentence but to save $50,000 or whatever you could do worse things. ",

There's a [page](https://web.iit.edu/onestop/undocumented-students) about it; you should talk to an admissions counselor and/or financial aid about your situation.

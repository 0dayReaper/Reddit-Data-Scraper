I transferred out of IIT engineering to Ohio State and had friends in architecture at both schools and the work load seemed similar. I transferred out of IIT cause I hated the school, but if you're doing architecture it's probably worth it",

You will be spending most of your time in studio, and trust me when I say you\u2019ll be spending SO much money on materials. The campus is lowkey depressing, and there\u2019s not a big social life unless you meet the right people.",

    "postText": "A few days ago, I got an email congratulating me \"again\" on my admission to Illinois Tech and saying that I had been selected as a finalist for an Emerging Campus Leaders Scholarship. However, the decision status on my application tracker still reads as \"pending decision\". Does this mean that I have received admission but my offer letter is taking time to be processed?",

It was mentioned in that email that I need to submit these documents for the offer letter. The last date to accept an admission offer is March 1 (I applied in Early Action). Also I am an international student, the requirements might be different for domestic students.",

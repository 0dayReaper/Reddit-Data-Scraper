    "postText": "Hello,  \n\n\nI recently got accepted to IIT Chicago, but as I also received another offer from a university I chose to not attend IIT.   \n\n\nIn the intent to enroll form, I selected the option \"I do not wish to attend IIT\", then it asked for a reason and I selected that I chose another university and hit submit. A few minutes later I got an email saying, \"Thank you for submitting your intent to enroll\".   \n\n\nNow I am confused, did I reject my application or not? When I log into the application portal, it says \"no application submitted\". But when I check the app tracker, it still tells me to upload my financial documents.  \n\n\nHow can I verify whether I have closed the application fully or not?",

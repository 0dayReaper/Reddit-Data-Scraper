I would contact IIT financial aid; they're happy to help even if you're not a student yet.",

I'll link it below.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is a viable option for your situation, but I suggest giving it a shot. I would contact the Office of Financial Aid beforehand for more information regarding the form. The deadline for this semester is November 5th, but fill it out as soon as possible. These forms take some time to process.\n\nIf you do decide to submit the form, remember to check your email for any updates. You may have to call the Office of Financial Aid to check in on the progress of the application processing (they may forget to update you on the status, it's happened to me before).\n\nDon't expect this to cover an entire $50k tuition. At best, it'll cover $5-$10k (split between both semesters), depending on your parents' financial situation. That's still much better than nothing.\n\nGood luck.\n\n[Application for Additional Financial Aid Consideration](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://web.iit.edu/sites/web/files/departments/financial-aid/pdfs/Additional%2520Financial%2520Aid%2520Consideration.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjh5ajrxfPcAhUkzIMKHW64Ct4QFjABegQICRAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1HrhnFNEtKYhq4dALKkbwu)",

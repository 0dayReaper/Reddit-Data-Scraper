If so, I'd suggest that you choose the thesis option.  The research and writing skills needed to complete the thesis will be beneficial to you as you pursue these other endeavors.  Best wishes!",

Since you mention you are not really into research, you should take the non-thesis. You can always switch later, but it's really only for people pursing a career in upper academics or research. If you're looking to get an office/field job after graduating it's not worth your time.",

To get an answer to your specific question about the thesis option, my suggestion is that you ring the appropriate program director at IIT and talk to them directly\u2014I'm sure you're not the first applicant with this inquiry.\n\nMy initial graduate program at a different institution didn't involve writing a thesis, and upon deciding that I wanted to do so, I learned that I needed to switch to a slightly different program.  My school was fairly accommodating, as they still had an academic MA program in their catalog which was technically closed to new applicants (as they were focusing on some newly established doctoral programs), but they grandfathered me in anyway, so it all worked out.\n\nGood luck on the whole process!  I'm sure you'll do well.",

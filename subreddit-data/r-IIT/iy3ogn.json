    "postText": "What\u2019s going on r/IIT,  your moderators have given me their blessing to ask you all for some help, so I hope you\u2019ll bear with me for the duration of my little pitch.  I\u2019m a student intern with a website called CollegeVizzy, and our mission is to help students who have an otherwise limited capacity to visit colleges.  In the past, this meant a focus on primarily FGLI applicants, but, given COVID, the utility of our site has taken on a new dimension.\r\n\r\nWhat CollegeVizzy is, in a nutshell, is a platform where college students can make prompted social-media style posts about their college campus\u00ac\u2013and where prospective students can compile and share notes and impressions of universities they\u2019ve visited.  The end result, we hope, will be a resource that provides a somewhat more comprehensive look at colleges than a virtual tour or an Instagram page might give by itself.  And now, more than probably ever until this point, high school students could use as much information as possible to learn about the schools they are considering.  \r\n\r\nOf course while this is a nice idea, we still need a strong, content-creating user base.  And that\u2019s where you guys can help.  If you\u2019re interested in making an account and telling us about IIT, the site link is below.  Everything is free, there are no ads, we sell no user data, and making a post will enter you into a giveaway that we\u2019re running for a $150 Uber Eats gift card.  \r\n\r\nTell us anything!  Show us your favorite spots on campus, your dorm room, or whatever you think prospective students should know.  If you have any questions about the site or about posting, or any feedback, leave it down below.  I didn\u2019t want to talk (write?) your guys\u2019 ears off, so if there\u2019s anything that doesn\u2019t make sense or isn\u2019t clear I would be more than happy to follow up in the comments.  Thanks!\n\nLink! https://collegevizzy.com",

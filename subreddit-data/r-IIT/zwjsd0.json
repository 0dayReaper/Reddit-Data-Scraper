    "postText": "I applied to IIT and until now have gotten almost a full scholarship with merit and financial from other universities so I\u2019m hoping for the same here. Thing is that I keep hearing that everyone that goes here are just white neckbeards. It seems like a good university to me and I don\u2019t mind the fact that Greek life ain\u2019t big but I also appreciate having some school life/spirit yk? I don\u2019t wanna hang out with some boring crackers for 4 years yk? I appreciate hanging out with people that have niche interests but I need a mix. Like can I have a good couple of years(study,hang around/make friends,date, etc.) or is it gonna be some lonely shit where I\u2019m friends with 1 guy I hate for 4 years cuz everyone else is in their own world?",

Ik a lot of people get pissed when you bring up race or ethnicity but I\u2019m a mixed person from Puerto Rico and I feel an extreme culture clash with more traditional white Americans that can sometimes feel alienating. That\u2019s why im more interested in a university like this in the city where there\u2019s more diversity. At the end of the day im just trynna find mfs to vibe with yk.

My friend group was always very diverse - white, black, hispanic, indian, turkish, iranian, etc. You just have to put yourself out there tho - most people don't do that. If you don't put yourself out there, at least make friends in your classes.\n\nDating-wise - ehhh it's a bit awkward if you wanna date multiple people over the course of the years (ofc no one plans for that but it really depends on you whether you'll get laid often or not) because it's a small school. if you live on campus, you'll see the same faces on a weekly basis.\n\nIIT gets a bad wrap, but post graduation looking back, I have a lot of good memories and great friends.",

It's a nerdy school, you have to go out of your way to be social unless you want to hang out with neckbeards who aren't putting in any effort. Only transfer students will be able to give you a good picture of how it compares to other colleges though.\n\nRace-wise? Mixed. About a third of undergrads are international (mostly Indian, Chinese). They tend to stick together. Of the domestic students, about half are white. Nonwhite students are probably clustered in different orgs. I wasn't in orgs like that, but they exist: the school is 5% black but I only had one black fraternity brother out of 60, so there must be spaces in the school that are more black than that 5% \"average\". Had a few Mexican brothers, and of course a bunch of Indian and Chinese guys from overseas. Been out of school too long to tell you demographics of any particular org though.\n\n&gt; can I have a good couple of years(study,hang around/make friends,**date**, etc.)\n\nmuch easier if you're gay. Not a lot of girls at IIT, though it's gotten better in recent years. Of course you're in Chicago and you can swipe on SAIC girls on tinder, party with friends from other schools, go clubbing or whatever.\n\nGood luck on your aid package",

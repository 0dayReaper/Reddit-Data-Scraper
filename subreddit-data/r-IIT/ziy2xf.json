For the upcoming Spring semester, final exams end on 6 May 2023.However, there is a Spring Degree Conferral and Commencement on 13 May 2023, is this a physical event which requires us to be on campus? Or do we even need to attend this?\n2. Is there any disadvantage of selecting online courses rather than physical MIES campus courses?",

If you are graduating, it is your choice to attend. Most graduates choose to go because it is a great accomplishment and they want to celebrate that.",

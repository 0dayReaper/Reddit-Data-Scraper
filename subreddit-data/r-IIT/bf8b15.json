I heard that it's not much of a party school which is fine with me as long as I can make some friends. I'm mostly just looking to get my education and not feel too lonely.  Any thoughts?",

Not much going on on the weekends, but the location is great for day trips in Chicago. Not a CS major, but a lot of friends are and they say the department is pretty good, but there are some bad profs. If you just want an education and a no-frills college experience, IIT is pretty good.",

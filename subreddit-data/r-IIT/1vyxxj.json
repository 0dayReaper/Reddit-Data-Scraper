We're currently working with tons of companies such as SparkFun, Electric Imp, the Illinois MakerLab, Oso Technologies, etc. so that we can have a lot of hardware at hand and so that we can offer hardware specific prizes. Hardware is going to be its own section with lots of supplies and technical mentors. \n\nYou're allowed to bring an existing project, but you'll only be judged on what's actually done at HackIllinois. Once full registration goes live, there will be a section asking for hardware requests if you want to start a brand new project. \n\nSo, please tell everyone about HackIllinois!",

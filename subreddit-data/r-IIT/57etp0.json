Infact, they ostly seek to introduce you to the important concepts in CS. Anything you dont take before you transfer can be made up by taking the required courses for the program here. All undergrad programs assume no familiarity with the subject so you should be on equal footing.\n\nThat being said, your gen ed courses - math, logic, etc - would be good to look into how they transfer so you dont get stuck retaking courses. Infact, all credits you want to transfer should be checked out. Transferring credits, rather than preparedness, will be your biggest challenge ",

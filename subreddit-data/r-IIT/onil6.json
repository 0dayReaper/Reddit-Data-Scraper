    "postText": "My parents are planning on visiting in the next couple months and I am curious what would be a good, relatively inexpensive hotel to recommend them. They're flying in and are unfamiliar with the city, so it would be nice to find one near a L stop. Any suggestions?\n\nAlso, where would be good to go for a decent dinner? I know there are a bunch of tourist places downtown (Hard Rock, etc), but what would be a good authentic Chicagoan place (that is not particularly expensive) I can treat them to?",

Poncho Pistolas is a great mexican restaurant especially if you like Margaritas. There is Franco's if they like upscale Italian or try Freddies or Ricobene's if they want more dive atmosphere. \n\nI really suggest if you are new to IIT or the Chicago south side that you go someplace in Bridgeport. If your parents are anything like my parents they will appreciate seeing that it is not just ghettos and gangsters.",

There's also the Travelodge off the Harrison red line stop. You can find rooms in these hotels for ~$100/night, sometimes less, and they are the cheapest in the city unless you downgrade to a hostel.\n\nCheck out [/r/chicago](/r/chicago)'s sidebar for great dining options.",

Just because IIT recommends it doesn't mean it is actually the best idea, a cheap place in the actual south loop would be a far better consideration as they would have very easy access to the trains as well as being within walking distance of many fine places to eat and see. Not to mention due to the much greater frequency with which the red line in Chicago operates vs bus service they would actually most likely get on campus in the same time. \n\nEDIT: To be clear I am just opposing the South Loop hotel idea. If the family is alright with staying in Gunsalaus that is a fine idea. ",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I got accepted into IIT as an applied math major and got a good scholarship with it. I\u2019ve been interested in the school and recently I started researching it\u2019s opportunities after graduation and I noticed how a lot of people said how IIT doesn\u2019t give the best opportunities and don\u2019t cooperate with helping their students achieve this. \n\nAny advice on that? Especially since people say the school will only benefit you if you go into engineering related majors.\n\nAlso the area seems to be known as a bit ghetto and so me being a small female, it brought concerns to me, what do you all think about the area around IIT?\n\nAnd lastly but not least, do you all think it\u2019s worth going to IIT based on my circumstances? I want to get into tech with my math degree but I don\u2019t want to have to drag on getting my degree for 5-6 years when I could get it faster somewhere else if that makes sense.\n\nOverall I\u2019m just concerned about the safety and opportunities iit has for its students sooo yea please anyone just hElp \ud83e\uddcd\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

            "comment": "I think a lot of your academic/professional concerns will depend on how willing you are to seek things out. I've found that many individuals and student organizations on campus are very willing to help people find opportunities during and after school. But you have to actually ask people about it. I don't have specific experience with Applied Math as a major (I'm 4th year CS). However, I know that there's a strong Association for Women in Mathematics chapter on campus you could reach out to. Many professors are also really nice and have connections to research labs etc. that they can connect you with. If you want to get into tech, I think IIT is a great place to pursue both. You could minor in CS I believe, or ITM.\n\nAs far as the location, the fact of the matter is that it's a big city. I lived on campus for two years, and now live in Bridgeport (across the highway). I've never really felt unsafe as a female either in Bronzeville or Bridgeport. You should take some precautions (walk with an awareness of your surroundings, find a buddy if you're out late at night), otherwise I think it's pretty safe. Again, Chicago, there are always going to be fluke shootings or muggings, so you have to make that call for yourself.\n\nAll that to say, I personally recommend IIT highly if you are willing to put in the time to make your degree work for you. If you want your school to give you more personalized guidance on everything to do (this is a very valid desire), IIT might not be the right place. But, IIT does want you to do cool stuff, you just have to ask for it, and help make it happen. I hope that helps, please ask followups if that is vague haha.",

I've been out of my undergrad for about 6 years now, decided to enroll at IIT because they are offering the Pathway scholarship and I'm WFH indefinitely. I already have a career built, but I figured why the hell not?\n\nI signed up for one class (ECE429) and have to say its hands down the worst educational experience of my entire life. I went to a public university for my undergrad which isn't exactly known for esteemed academics, and this single class at IIT somehow managed to be as worthless as the WORST classes during my undergrad years. The course costs **$6400**, and it kind of amazed me people are willing to pay for it. I didn't even pay and still feel like I was ripped off. Completely asinine waste of both time and money. It's a required course for the degree and I genuinely feel bad for anyone who is forced to waste hours of their life doing this.\n\nObviously YMMV, this is one class in many, but its bad enough to have made me completely withdraw from graduate school. It's like everything shitty about academia all rolled into one course, which is not what I would have expected from a private university, especially not when people are paying $1600 per credit.\n\nIf you need a graduate degree, from my experience, just go to some public university where the classes cost 1/4 what they do at IIT.",

Any neighborhood you will find people saying don't live there for the same reason. Much of the stigma for IIT stems from the old Robert Taylor homes that were just off the south end of campus.  Of course like others have said use your brain, take a buddy, tell people where you are going. \n\nAs for finding opportunities the math department does a lot for their students to find jobs.  The actual number of math majors at IIT is not very high so it is a close group.  I know a few people who graduated as math majors and had no issues getting jobs. One took the actuarial route and the other does analysis.",

            "comment": "So I wasn't able to figure out if you are talking about undergraduate or graduate classes, but I'll assume undergraduate in my answer because I don't know much about the graduate program.\n\nYour English is alright, and it is common at IIT for students not to have perfect English. We have a lot of Chinese and Korean students and resources for international students so it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nThere are many resources to help with classes and work, but whether you're happy at IIT depends mainly on if you are able to get to know people and are alright with terrible Chicago weather.\n\nThere aren't a ton of activities on campus; IIT isn't really known for its partying, but there are things to do pretty often, so you shouldn't get too bored.\n\nI probably spend 4-5 hours on average per week studying/working, but that probably varies A LOT from person to person. Also, I work more when papers and projects are due and less when they aren't. Studying depends on the person more than anything, so you get out what you put in.\n\nGood luck!",

I mean, do they help you out and support you?\n\nI'm assuming this question pertains to the question above. There are a lot of international students here so I would assume that the support is great. I used to work for the international center and as far as everything else (immigration, job search, maintaining status) we are very good with helping you out with paperwork and deadlines! I do not know much about the language help though, you can email onestop@iit.edu any inquiries about that.\n\n&gt;There is some kind of activities and parties or some thing like that for students?\n\nIIT does not party. Yeah, they have fraternities and sororities that say they party, but personally I don't consider that partying. However, there are people I know that do party. I live off campus and have met people just by commuting, and the friends I have met don't party as much as I thought or partake in activities that I like to do. But hey, you are in Chicago. I have fun here. A thing I love about Chicago is the music scene, so if you're into that you'll have a lot of fun. \n\n&gt; How much time do you actually spend studying in your home per day?\n\nI take very good notes, go through them here and there. On average everyday I spend 2 - 4 hours. Some days more, some days less. Come exam time, I study 2 weeks ahead of time, and try to get at least 6 hours every other day. And on those alternating days I keep to 2 or 3. If I have to cram, I live at the library. (10 hrs). \n\n\nSorry this is long, but another thing I want to add. I thoroughly enjoy my time at IIT. I personally enjoy that IIT isn't a huge college scene, especially if you live off campus. I just do my shit, go home, and have my own fun. I can't tell you much from living on campus, but I'm assuming it can't be that bad. It's a good education, generally friendly helpful professors, and city living. :)",

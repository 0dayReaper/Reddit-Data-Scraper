A lot of small assignments though. Devon Cook has a really good Book of Mormon class that I found to be pretty easy as well. I also think Brent Top teaches a few different relgion classes as either has no final or it is pretty easy. I do know he requires you to do some big project, but the project can be anything related to the gospel really. I did a mural on my apartment door.",

I would never want to dismiss someone's concerns over this topic or any other challenges to their faith. I believe it's factually incorrect to represent that the entire JST came from Clark's commentary. \n\nYes, there's enough overlap to  conclude it played a significant role. Yes, Haley Wilson did leave the Church. However, from her own remarks, it wasn't the only reason she left. It did play a big part. Her professor, Thomas Wayment didn't leave. He's been on record saying the findings only further increased his testimony of the JST and revelations surrounding it. \n\nThe work they did on this subject is fascinating and worth the study. Haley has dismissed the rumors of any attempted cover ups or efforts to suppress their findings. I find it admirable, both from an academic and religious perspective that the University published their work. I appreciate your comment helping to educate others who may not be familiar with the topic. I just don't agree that it's as one sided as your comment makes it appear.",

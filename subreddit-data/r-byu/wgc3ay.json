    "postText": "What are some of the better places to live overall. I will be moving out to Provo in June of next year and starting school the following semester. I wanted to ask what is everyone's opinion of a good place to live that is close to campus. Social aspect would be nice. I am a 22 year old returned missionary so a complex with less freshmen / 18 year olds. Also when should I start looking for housing if I am coming in June? Thanks a ton!",

Apartment complex management is notoriously awful in places like liberty. My friends are always telling me horror stories about contract issues or straight up having no hot water for days\u2026 there are lots of nice places to rent in the neighborhood south of campus.",

I hear that the social life for Liberty Square is pretty good too. If you are coming in June, I'd look around near the end of winter semester (April) for people trying to sell summer contracts.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m looking for housing for myself and some of my friends who are getting off their missions for Fall/Winter semesters of 2023-2024. I\u2019ve been at Heritage this year (I\u2019m currently a non-RM freshman), and it\u2019s alright, but it gotten to feel kind of prisoney and less home-like just because of the surveillance, visiting hours, etc. So far we\u2019re thinking of rooming at the Riviera since it seems to be cheap and has decent amenities. Is there anywhere else I should look at (ideally ~$400 or less, off campus would be preferred, but needs to be BYU contracted). Also, does anyone know exactly what the rent at the Riv, what it\u2019s like to live there, how are the cleaning checks, are there RAs, and how the parking is? Also, does anyone know of it will change a lot now that it has been acquired by BYU and I guess will be considered On-Campus housing now? Thanks!",

We do have RA's. Management isn't great but cleaning checks aren't bad at all. I wasn't here before it was acquired, but it seems like one change is just that there are more younger students here now than there were before.",

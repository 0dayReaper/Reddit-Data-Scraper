It says that you need to do those to \"receive full consideration for all scholarships for which you may be eligible.\" You need to fill out the FAFSA for eligibility for a Financial Aid based scholarship, and the essays are for other scholarships (like if a donor said to use this scholarship on students with x condition specifically, they check for that using the essays). Still great to do both, because you never know what you may be eligible for, but it seems that OP is primarily concerned with academic scholarships.\n\nFor academic scholarships, they just take each individual school at BYU, say that there are X amount of scholarships available, and take the X top GPAs. You still have to \"apply,\" meaning you can just log in, check the boxes for the semesters you want to be considered for, and then submit, but nothing other than GPA is considered. I worked at BYU Enrollment services from 2018-2020 and we got \\*a lot\\* of questions about this, it's not the most intuitive process.",

You should still do FAFSA, but you can finish it after submitting the scholarship application. \n\nJust so you know, it's not just 4.0s that get scholarships. Depending on your department, you can get 1/2 tuition with about a 3.75 and full tuition with about a 3.95 so you should never stop applying even if your GPA drops a bit. BYU wants to reward students that take the academics seriously.",

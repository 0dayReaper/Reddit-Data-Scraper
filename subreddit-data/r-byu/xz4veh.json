Especially with my ethnicity and religion? How hard would it be to access halal food and other stuff I might need as a muslim?",

Out of a population of over 30,000. \n\nGiven that, students at BYU are pretty welcoming and friendly. Students generally mean well and among my Muslim and Arab friends I don't remember hearing about outright racism or anything. One of my friends said that dating was a big challenge because a lot of people are looking for an LDS partner, but BYU and UVU are big schools so there will always be people that don't care.\n\nProbably the biggest thing will just be dealing with Church stuff constantly. You have to take all of the religion classes, and they are much harder when you don't have an LDS background or mission experience. Plus, while most people will respect your beliefs, there will be a lot of people trying to convert you. So do with that info as you will. Overall, I my Muslim friends were pretty evenly split on being happy or regretting coming to BYU.",

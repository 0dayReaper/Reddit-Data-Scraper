I just think they're quite expensive and would love if they were cheaper. I was gonna go to either UT Austin or Texas A&amp;M but the financial aid they were offering (particularly at UT) was abismal. BYU offered to cover a quarter of the tuition my first year and has covered full tuition since.\n\nYou can find party culture and substance abuse here (though definitely a lot less substance abuse). You can also find people that are on campus until 11 PM every day studying or working at any of the schools you listed. I don't see BYU as being particularly unique academically. Culturally, it is unique and has its pros and cons, but I don't look down on any other university.",

There is, however, a sense that Latter-Day Saint students are likely to have pretty extreme difficulty fitting in at schools other than the BYU schools and maybe a dozen or so others, just because the typical American college campus culture is so different from the religious culture. I grew up in Texas (and have since moved back) and I knew enough about the party culture here to know that I would be really uncomfortable if I went to college here.

            "comment": "I\u2019ve actually thought about this a ton lately, especially with the way BYU is depicted/perceived in a lot of social media spheres. On TikTok, it seems both the Church and BYU are the punchline of jokes about soaking (no one in their right mind actually believes soaking is a loophole for the law of chastity. That is bonkers), isolated and homogenized culture, and religious fanaticism. \n\nWhat I find so fascinating about these depictions is that BYU is honestly\u2014at least to me\u2014just like many other universities. My professors are genuine academics with graduate degrees and years of research experience in their respective fields. Administrators worry about enrollment diversity and creating belonging on campus. We have a ton of niche clubs dedicated to various political ideologies, a plethora of hobbies, sports, music interests, and major and career related fields. The students I\u2019ve interacted with, though predominantly white, are diverse in their perspectives, beliefs, interests, and yes\u2014if they are members of the Church\u2014their \u201cflavor\u201d of Mormonism. \n\nI honestly have to chuckle at the way many outside of BYU (and even a few students at BYU) view the university because, for me, it\u2019s just not that weird. \n\nWe certainly have problems with racism and homophobia on campus that, in my personal opinion, are heightened by aspects of the school\u2019s honor code. But the honor code generally strives to create a clean and moral campus community, even if it falls short at that goal in various ways. To that degree though, I\u2019m inclined to believe that other predominantly white institutions of education also struggle with racism/prejudice/ignorance. The majority of students I\u2019ve met at BYU are trying to learn more, be better, and use their presence in the campus community to make the marginalized feel more seen, heard, and included\u2014something students at other PWIs are striving to do as well.\n\nI\u2019m personally weary of those who paint the university in broad strokes, because like any other university, it\u2019s not a monolith. It\u2019s 33,000 students and hosts of different professors trying to make sense of the world we live in, and that\u2019s a messy process in any higher education setting. The ONLY thing that makes BYU different is it\u2019s striving to ground that experience in the gospel of Jesus Christ\u2014and notice I say \u201cstriving\u201d because that effort is humanly faulty. But they try, and I think that counts for something. \n\nIn terms of a self-righteous attitude toward other universities, I\u2019m sure select students suffer with that delusion\u2014but most don\u2019t. And most are just here to get their degree and get on with their lives.",

But it\u2019s not an arrogance thing, it\u2019s just some universities have higher standards than others, and both schools can be great fantastic schools and that\u2019s ok. No one really rubs that in that there are high standards at BYU. Maybe we\u2019ll brag about a specific program, but not the standards because that\u2019s kinda weird.",

It\u2019s not something I or any student I know would ever brag about. And we don\u2019t look down on anyone else either. It\u2019s not a sense either it\u2019s just a fact of the matter that there\u2019s an honor code here so you are forced to live cleaner than you would somewhere else. I\u2019m sure there are other places that may have even more strict honor codes: are they morally superior? Factually yes, but it\u2019s not a competition. \n\nSo anywho, I\u2019m sure many people will miss understand and freak out that I\u2019m claiming a school with an honor code is more moral, but it\u2019s not really an opinion, I\u2019m just speaking the truth of it all and not trying to judge other schools as bad because they don\u2019t have one.",

In my experience, most BYU students think BYU is one of the most wholesome universities and thinks other colleges are places where people get drunk and hook up all the time. Whenever I\u2019ve watched movies about normal colleges with friends or roommates there\u2019s generally conversations about BYU\u2019s safety and security from this culture. \n\nI don\u2019t think everyone thinks that, or even if they do if they look down or think these universities are absolutely evil or inferior per say. But there definitely is slight air of superiority for BYU student in most conversations when they are talking about other colleges and frats and parties. \n\nBYU is a religious university that has such tight rules and connection with the church that it isn\u2019t surprising that most students speak that way about other college students who are having a normal young adult experience. At church they\u2019ve taught us since our youth that even small amounts of alcohol, and drugs will bar you from heaven and ruin your life. Hooking up and partying is portrayed in church videos as a temptation from Satan or just a really bad decision. \n\nI know of some students who attend parties, drink, use drugs or hookup but it has mostly been really secretive. Everyone knows that these behaviors are against the honor code and will get you kicked out, losing credits you\u2019ve earned and possibly creating huge family drama if you come from a churchy family.",

Lots of very explicit racism, homophobia, and transphobia, sexism, and sometimes antisemitism. This is especially a problem in the engineering and business schools. \n\nThat being said, when I was touring colleges for undergrad a few years back, I was absolutely horrified by how segregated UT Austin and Texas A&amp;M were. In Texas (idk about other states), they straight up called the frats \"the white frats\" and \"the minority frats\". Knowing the history of both schools, it's just discomforting for a person of color like me. I'm very glad there are no frats or sororities here.",

We have the best accounting program in the nation and a top 20 business schools, not to mention several other high ranked programs. And we place one of the largest groups of alumni in Ivy League and other top schools. Regardless, many students choose to come here because it is very cheap for a very good education.",

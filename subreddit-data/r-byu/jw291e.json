    "postText": "This month our team has been doing some research on the BYU housing market, talking to academics, emailing local real estate brokers, digging through off-campus housing rules, and looking through business records. Everyone knows BYU housing has problems, but it\u2019s time we have a real discussion about the root causes.\n\nHere are a few excerpts from \u201cThe Provo Housing Racket\u201d that summarize our findings pretty succinctly:\n\n\u2014\n\nToo often, BYU students are over-charged, abused, and taken advantage of by their landlords. And, despite good intentions, BYU is one of the greatest culprits behind Provo\u2019s broken student housing market.\n\nBYU places significant hurdles in the way of would-be landlords, limiting the supply of available housing and costing students more. First, BYU contracted apartments are required to physically segregate male and female designated units. Since most apartments in the U.S. are gender-neutral by default, a large chunk of housing is written-off on that basis alone. Second, BYU contracted apartments must be located within a certain distance of campus, limiting the geography for BYU housing to a mere 2.7 square miles. That area includes established businesses and married housing, as well as streets and greenspace.\n\nAs a result, many BYU apartments are thirty, forty, even fifty years old. Building new is expensive, and the pool of non-BYU contracted housing within the zone is limited. Most newer developments are on the premium side of the market (The Village, College Place, etc.). If students had a wider range of affordable options to choose from, rent would fall and quality would rise.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that BYU has built a system primed for exploitation\u2014a system where the rules of supply and demand no longer apply, and landlords can count on a captive audience of vulnerable renters. What\u2019s worse is the way that BYU has abandoned its responsibility to protect students. Last winter, BYU moved classes online and told students to go home. Students on-campus were released from their contracts in the dorms without penalties. Students off-campus, however, were left to fend for themselves. BYU did little to pressure complexes to release students from contracts, even though the university could have threatened to rescind BYU approval for non-compliant housing. \n\nIf BYU is going to require students to live in BYU contracted housing with all of the drawbacks that entails\u2014special rules, higher rents, lower quality\u2014BYU needs to do more to protect students. This means:\n\nNo more 12-month contracts: require complexes to offer fall/winter contracts since most students leave Provo in April. \n\nNo more monopolies: limit the reach of companies like Redstone Residential that exercise unfair control over the housing market.\n\nFinally, pick sides: when crises like COVID-19 break out, BYU needs to side with students. The university has played neutral for far too long.\n\nOr better yet, BYU should let students live where they want and let the problems work themselves out.",

It's the fact that BYU is doing more harm than good in creating an artificial, geographically constrained captive market. And for what net benefit to students? We still deal with the same issues we would otherwise with landlords, aging properties, etc. Like others have said, BYU isn't a judge: their only leverage is their ability to pull approvals from landlords. As the COVID situation has proved, BYU doesn't really have the power to protect students in the way I think many student thought they did. What is the real benefit of the OCH program then vs. business as usual property rentals? Students are basically asked to sacrifice flexibility and freedom on the open market for what, a standard lease agreement? The option to use arbitration at BYU to resolve conflicts? Seems like a poor trade-off. Is BYU's implementation of OCH policy just a way to enforce HCO policy then? If so, it was doomed from the start as policing student behavior is an impossible task; we are pretty good at beating the rules if motivated enough.\n\n$400 a month can get you a decent apartment...if you are used to living in dingy, shared $300/month units. The nicer private units in Provo are trending towards $500+ and even decent shared units are trending $350+ now. My roommates (3 brothers) and I were lucky in that we were approved for a waiver. We moved to a townhouse Vineyard (i.e. MUCH nicer than 95% of housing in Provo) and pay $400/month each. We are so fine with a 10-minute longer commute in exchange for that and have honestly had fewer issues out of the property manager than we did in Provo, despite *gasp* not having the protection of BYU's standard residential lease agreement.",

Unless something has changed substantially in the last six months, $400 a month can get you a pretty nice apartment at BYU.\n* Old dilapidated apartments with slumlord owners are a feature of college towns, not something exclusive to Provo. UVU gets away with nice, new apartments because UVU was literally a fifth of its current size twelve years ago. Give it twenty or thirty years and UVU's housing scene will start to look like Provo's.\n* BYU isn't a court. Unless there's a legitimate contract dispute, OCH doesn't have any authority to cancel a contract between a tenant and a landlord.

We have spoken to students in a variety of different college towns, and we believe our assessment is fair. Let\u2019s look at an example: a shared bedroom at Liberty on Freedom (one of the larger housing complexes) is $400/month. Each unit has two shared bedrooms, a total of four residents altogether. The four tenants share a small bathroom, the kitchens don\u2019t have dishwashers, and the complex is generally quite dilapidated and run-down. I am happy to provide more examples.\n\n2. Crumby apartments are certainly a feature of college towns, but most colleges allow students to choose where to live. BYU students should be able to choose to live in those nicer Orem apartments, for example.\nEven Provo has better housing options if you look outside of BYU-approved housing. \n\n3. BYU isn\u2019t a court, but the university writes most off-campus housing contracts. They also decide which landlords to approve as BYU contracted apartments. If BYU is going to force students to live in BYU contracted housing, then BYU should have forced BYU landlords to be more lenient with students attempting to be released from their contracts. That would be fully within their rights as a private institution. \n\n4. The fact that UVU students live in BYU housing is a negative for BYU renters. To improve conditions, BYU landlords need to be competing for tenants. Many of the largest BYU complexes boast 100% occupancy year-round, reducing the incentive to offer better deals for renters.",

If you don't like the examples of Stanford and Penn State, take my hometown in Texas -- the University of North Texas and Texas Women's University are not particularly expensive universities, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a shared anything for less than $500 a month. Getting away from college towns, I did an internship in Los Alamos one summer. I paid $600 a month for a bedroom in a house.",

Even including internet and utilities, I never paid more than about $310 a month. The complex was a little older, but it was very well maintained and regularly updated. In fact, I never paid more than $330 a month in rent and utilities for any apartment I stayed at in Provo, and I know a number of people who paid even less for their apartments. It's a pretty well known fact that if you want a pleasant housing experience in Provo, you stay away from the likes of Liberty (overpriced, rundown) and the Village (overpriced, packed with summer sales bros).\n2. Better? Sure. Cheaper? Not usually. There are a handful of complexes very close to UVU that offer competitive rent with BYU housing, but most of the places I see in Provo are still in the $400 to $500 range, even if you cram two people into every bedroom. And if you open up that market to students, I'm sure you'll see prices jump in those areas.\n3. BYU can choose not to renew an off-campus housing contract with a particular complex, but that is literally the extent of their legal authority, and it's more like a slap on the wrist -- as long as the complex keeps their apartments up to snuff, there's absolutely no reason I can think of that they won't get reapproved as suitable off-campus housing.\n4. You won't hear much argument from me here--less competition would mean better prices. But I still haven't seen anything in Provo that suggests apartments are any more expensive than apartments in any other college town.",

This type of behavior is not unique to the BYU housing market. \n\nIn my experience BYU students love to complain about BYU problems as if they were unique only to BYU when, in fact, they exist at literally every major university (yes, I know this is a huge overgeneralization, but it is true for a lot of things that BYU students complain about).\n\nAlso, even if BYU were to get rid of all of their OCH policies, I bet most students would still want to live close to campus in the same complexes they live in now, and I highly doubt it would decrease rent prices. The reality is that the \"monopoly\" of off-campus housing exists in Provo because of the proximity to campus and the social life of living in a student complex, not because of BYU's policies.",

To avoid jacking up rents and getting everybody angry at them, they transitioned to a 'cheaper,' year round contract model. However if this was no longer an option they would start charging more money for F/W and we would still be losing.

You can blame BYU for creating a closed market through their approved housing system. If a landlord decides to rip students off (Which does happen, all the time, I promise you), students don't even have anywhere else to turn. There isn't anywhere else to live. As someone said in another comment, once the good places are filled, the bad places have to be filled. And they are always filled, because there is no competition. That's how I ended up living at Glenwood my first semester after my mission, where I don't think the clubhouse area had been cleaned in years. That's how students end up having nowhere to turn when landlords set quotas for their cleaning checks to guarantee a certain amount of income. Despite what the intentions are, the OCH office doesn't protect against these things, even though that is the intention. \n\nThe existence of BYU approved housing is the problem here. Everyone can see that. It's repeated every time this issue gets brought up on this subreddit. It is the thing to blame. If it disappeared, housing for students would improve tremendously.",

But I think it\u2019s naive to blame every problem with the off campus housing industry on on BYU. Do they play a huge role in it? Of course. But are they solely responsible? I don\u2019t think so (and that\u2019s saying a lot because I have very strong feelings about BYU, and they\u2019re not great.) \n\nI think that the issues are the fault of many - BYU, management companies, and property owners alike. \n\nThere is a lot of misinformation that is spread on this sub, and I think it\u2019s important to address it. I no longer work in off campus housing so I have nothing to lose by talking about this stuff anymore. There are no quotas for cleaning checks, the complexes hate them as much as the residents. In fact we often would lose money because the cleaners were insanely expensive. We had one move in where we spent 21k on cleaning and we most definitely did not cover that in charges to the residents. BYU requires cleaning checks for contracted housing and it sucks all around. \n\nAlso, many complexes struggle to fill. Glenwood is still not filled and I know of many complexes (some of the Liberty props included) that struggle to fill. Lib Square is an anomaly, and that\u2019s because people want to live there and will pay higher prices to do so. Most complexes run lots of specials and concessions at the end of the summer for that reason - they need to fill and have trouble doing so. So this whole idea that there\u2019s a monopoly and that all the complexes can charge more because there are more BYU students than beds is just not correct.  Not trying to be disagreeable, it\u2019s just fact. Again, I have many many of my own gripes with BYU and the management/owners of some of the complexes.

It would make my life sooo much easier in many aspects. It costs a lot of money to get a property to where it meets all of BYU\u2019s requirements and that of course gets passed on to the residents. \n\nI often compare the housing leases to a car lease. It\u2019s pretty straight forward - if you lease a car for 5 years instead of 3 your payment will be less because it\u2019s spread over a longer period of time. It\u2019s the same with housing contracts. \n\nAlso, if the complexes offer 8 month leases they will need to cover their costs for the summer months by increasing costs for shorter leases. You can\u2019t expect the complexes to take losses over the summer and not try and make up for that somehow.

In my own experience as an owner of my own rentals and as a third party manager, many things play into price. I was paying $350 a month for a 2 bedroom apartment simply because the owners were an older couple and hadn\u2019t looked into local pricing and never bothered to raise the rent over many years. \n\nIn your example for instance, it\u2019s quite possible that the first ownership had the property paid off or their mortgage was significantly lower than Redstone\u2019s mortgage when they purchased it (assuming they purchased it and didn\u2019t just take over management). Also, when a third party management company is hired the owner then has to pay management fees and may need to raise rent to cover those. \n\nOf course I don\u2019t know the exact situation of the complex you\u2019re referring to, but those are just some things that could have led to the increase in prices. Management companies aren\u2019t going to come in an arbitrarily raise prices, they need to stay competitive to lease the units and do extensive market research to come up with rates.",

                    "comment": "The idea behind the post is that if BYU is going to require students to live in BYU contracted housing, then BYU contracted housing should offer special protections to students--like the option to choose fall/winter or a 12mo contract. Prices would go up during the fall/winter term, but it would likely be cheaper to rent for 8-months at a premium than 12-months at the current rates, if Provo history is any indicator.\n\nAs far as releasing students from contracts during COVID, our argument is that BYU could have threatened to rescind BYU approval from complexes that are not flexible with students who need to get out of their contracts. \n\nBasically, if students can't gain access to the open market, then BYU should do more on behalf of students to compensate.",

                            "comment": "I\u2019m sure you know this already but landlords do not care who lives in their complexes. I was not a student living in a BYU approved complex. I knew several others that were the same. The landlords I\u2019m sure communicate with one another and they know that BYU can\u2019t rescind BYU approval from all of them. While BYU would like to have more control they really have none at all.\n\nThe situation with COVID was unfortunate but it was like that throughout the country (as well as in many parts of the world). Just because COVID hit shouldn\u2019t require any landlords to release students from their contracts. Landlords have had enough of a problem when the government forced them to not be able to evict anyone.\n\nBYU will also never be able to keep monopolies from happening. They have no legal status to keep a company from buying up a lot of the properties. The same thing happens in if they lose their BYU approval then there\u2019s not enough approved housing to go around. \n\nThe landlords will always have the power over BYU when it comes to major issues that affect the entire market or situations like COVID. The only time BYU will have control is if one complex decides to no longer segregate students. \n\nThe other issue that I see is that this only affects people for 2-3 years. Very few students deal with this for all 4 years. Most will live on campus for a year, live with family, transfer or drop out of school, or get married prior to dealing with off campus housing all 4 years. Trying to get anything to happen will take more than several years in my opinion. Therefore most students will just deal with it and move on with their life rather than fighting for change long after it no longer affects them. \n\nThe only way any of this changes is for BYU to no longer require living in approved housing.\n\nIf you want to continue to fight for students long after it affects you then more power to you. The chance of getting students that will really say or do much past the time it affects them will be minimal at best. Look at the protest regarding the Honor Code. They got maybe 100 people to walk around with signs for an afternoon and that was it. Most students are too busy with class and work and dating to deal with most of these issues. I mean the whole beard issue and shorts at BYU-I hasn\u2019t been able to be changed and the issue with housing is a whole lot bigger than those. Good luck but I think you\u2019re fighting a losing battle.",

You need to get the city on your side and have them start pressuring BYU or raise the standard of local code.\n\nOne thing to do is also to just start your own rental company, non-profit, or co-op and improve things. Doing research and acknowledging problems is great, but you have a lot of power to change it if you are willing to put in the work. Most (including myself) were not and just wanted to get an education and get out.",

A real estate investor with four apartment complexes in Provo isn\u2019t going to go hungry if a few tenants are released from their contracts. Redstone Residential actually received $2-5m in PPP loans (which are effectively grants). Aspen Ridge received a few hundred thousand. \n\nThe mom-and-pop landlords that own a unit or two are a different story, and I think a balance would need to be struck.",

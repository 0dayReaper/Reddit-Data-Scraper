    "postText": "Hello, I am a Korean student who wants to transfer to BYU for the fall semester of 2023. \n\nI have a GPA of 3.97 (It was evaluated by the IERF) and have a TOEFL score of 90. \n\nIn the transfer essay, I wrote 2 company internships, in-school presentation competitions, army experience, and 2 volunteer activities I did in high school and university. \n\nAlso, I wrote down my experience of playing tennis in college and having a debate on my activity list. \n\nThe most serious problem for me in BYU application is my credits.\n\nI currently took 99 credits in university. \n\nI am aware that BYU does not prefer students who have completed more than 90 credits at the previous instituion. \n\nIs it meaningless for transfer students with 90 credits or more to apply for BYU?\n\nOn top of that, If there is no possibility of passing BYU, I also consider BYUI.\n\nIs it a good idea for me to apply for BYUI?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry for not writing well because it's my first time writing on Reddit.\n\nThank you for reading!",

You could talk to [Enrollment Services](https://enrollment.byu.edu/registrar/transfer-evaluation) and ask if they could evaluate your transcript before transferring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I also consider BYUI.\n\nI think the important thing to consider whether to apply to BYU or BYU-I would be, \"why?\" Why do you want to go to Utah or Idaho? What are you hoping to achieve by applying to BYU or BYU-I? Are there majors that you want to study at both schools?",

I got an evaluation from IERF, do I have to get another evaluation from the university? I mean, it's already 99 credits, but I don't know what kind of evaluation you're talking about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I think the important thing to consider whether to apply to BYU or BYU-I would be, \"why?\" Why do you want to go to Utah or Idaho? What are you hoping to achieve by applying to BYU or BYU-I? Are there majors that you want to study at both schools?\n\nI am currently majoring in industrial engineering, and I hope to study manufacturing engineering in BYU and BYUI. I am aiming to get a bachelor's and master's degree in the United States and get a job at a local company (If I go to BYU, I aim to complete my undergraduate and master's degree at BYU. If I go to BYUI, I aim to complete my bachelor's degree and master's degree at BYU). The reason why I consider BYU or BYUI is complex. The biggest reason is that the tuition of the two universities is cheaper than other universities and provides high-quality education. I'm not financially wealthy, thus I can't afford to consider other universities. Also, the safe campus of BYU and BYUI is one of the reasons I chose. I heard from a BYU Korean graduate that these two universities are safer than other universities. \n\nAnother question, do I not have enough grades to apply for BYU or BYUI?",

IERF isn't BYU, it's a separate entity, they just make sure that there grades are standardized for students applying from all over the world. BYU enrollment services is the one that decides if you get in or not, so the OP was suggesting that you talk to them about your situation for better answers. \n\n2. Judging from your situation, it'll be better for you to just apply for grad school since it sounds like you are almost done with your undegrad, what year are you in? If you are going to complete your master\u2019s degree with BYU/in the states, an American bacelor\u2019s degree won't be of much importance to your future employer, provided that you can get in grad school (not that hard judging by your GPA). Which means you can save money by not paying for BYU undergrad, keep in mind living expenses here is around twice as expensive as East Asia. BYU is miles better compared to BYUI in terms of education and job opportunities, so def come here, BYUI reminds me of a community college. Are you a Latter Days Saints?\n\n3. Your grades are almost perfect, I won't worry about them! DM me if you have questions, I can probably get some Korean students to help you out!",

International is a different story because BYau can be accused of \"stat bumping\" by recruiting high level foreign students at the tail end of their degrees. It's case by case.

Apply for the diversity green card lottery. Don't know if S.Korea qualifies. \n2. Work at Samsung, and ask to get transferred to US office. \n3. Apply for graduate program at smaller universities in US near Silicon Valley or other cities with high tech industry, and try your luck then. It would be cheaper than doing undergrad in US. \n4. Come to BYU, join the LDS church and get married to US citizen, and get green card instantly. \n\nKeep in mind that it is very difficult to get a work visa (H1B) to work in US, and it is currently a lottery system.",

            "comment": "99 credits means you are most of the way to graduation. (Engineering majors tend to be long- like mechanical engineering takes many people 5 years starting day 1) and so they don't really want students who are basically done- sort of resetting and starting from the beginning. Transferable credits are different than what they fill at a specific university (i.e. classes toward graduation requirements- GE or major classes) Most colleges will not accept students with high credit transfers because then they did most of their school elsewhere but want to claim the prestige of the degree-granting university with a diploma.  BYUI is almost open enrollment, and doesn't really have as much in engineering. BYU is competitive. I would consider finishing what you started and plan to pursue a masters. I think a conversation with admissions could help you.",

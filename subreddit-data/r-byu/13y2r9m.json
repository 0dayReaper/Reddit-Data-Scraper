You learn a ton about how computers work, how online information is secured, and even get a taste of \"hacking\". It's not that hard, you just have to be willing to try things that you've never done before and have a hunger for knowledge. \n\nAnother is CS 110. It's called \"How To Code\" and is a super basic overview of coding. It is applicable in basically any field now, as you can use the stuff you learn to Automate parts of you job. It's not \"easy\" necessarily, but it's not hard if you can logic your way through a problem. \n\nOutside of computers, SFL 260 is Family Finance. It is super interesting, and taught me a ton about how to manage money in real life. \n\nIf you want a religion class, World Religions with Greg Wilkinson was amazing. It's very different from other religion classes, and really opened my eyes to the world. \n\nAnd of course, there is always GEOL 100. Dinosaurs. Pretty much universally loved by everyone who takes it. It's also basically impossible to fail.",

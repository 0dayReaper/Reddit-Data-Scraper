    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm about to graduate next week. During my time at BYU I looked deeper into concerns about church doctrine and history, fully intending to find faithful answers, but came away with the clear conclusion that the church is not true. \n\nI know five or six other current students who are in the same boat, and I know first hand how isolating it is to be surrounded by people you used to feel a connection to, but who would think you were evil or \"tricked by satan\" if they knew you no longer believed. \n\nI know we have an office of belonging, do they do anything for ex-believers? A few of my friends still have a couple years left, two are planning to transfer but at least one plans to stay a couple more years until graduation. Do any of you know of groups or safe faculty that apostates can hangout with?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I will be honest here it is not in BYU\u2019s interest to provide support to those who have lost their faith. Likely as a former member of the faith you won\u2019t feel particularly inclined to become a donor to the school as that would be equal to still providing support to the LDS church which based in your brief description of your Faith journey seems like something you would not wish to do. \n\nWhile it is true that many LGBTQIA+ students at the Y will also not be future donors, the optics of supporting them through the Office of Belonging and the adherence to laws regarding their protective status creates that type of need for the university. \n\nIf the University offered this support it would be targeted towards getting you to return to the faith as that benefits the University the most. It would also likely be something hand by the ward and bishopric of the students rather than the administrators or professors. \n\nThat is cold comfort and perhaps not the most Christian of attitude regarding lost sheep but it is the way of things. \n\nIt would be best to transfer to another school rather than stay on for the mental health if the former believer. \n\nLosing your faith means you have lost a part of your identity and being surrounded by other\u2019s who still hold to that identity can be triggering and lead to stress, depression, and other negative experiences especially as you are rebuilding your identity after deconstructing it. Having somewhere new and safe explore and build a new part of yourself is something that should be sought after. \n\nI am sorry the University cannot/will not provide you with the support you need and that many will need to make the choice to leave or stay and endure. \n\nWhatever the outcome of your path though know that there are staff, professors, and administrators who still love and care about all of the students even if their faith paths diverge and though they often cannot be open about it want to continue to support any they have taught. \n\nBest of luck on your journey towards finding your happiness.",

I\u2019d believe that a full third of graduating students don\u2019t consider themselves full members of the church, but of course BYU doesn\u2019t want people knowing there\u2019s other people questioning, so being public about your beliefs will lead to you getting kicked out. It absolutely sucks, and I\u2019ve only made it this far by finding solidarity with other people in the same boat. Especially when I was first questioning the church and hadn\u2019t found those friends for support, it was terrifying just walking around campus, wondering if anyone knew and might report me. Which kept me quiet, which served BYU\u2019s interests to keep any dissent to the church quiet. \n\nBut I also get what you mean about loving it here. There are some really wonderful people at BYU who, having shared the experience of being a queer Mormon eventually leaving the church or some variation on that, I have uniquely strong relationships with. I\u2019ve gotten a good education here. Really the only problems at this point are the mind-numbingly boring experiences that every interaction with the church is at this point, especially religion classes, and occasional dumbasses like seem to unfortunately exist on this sub expressing their derision for abstract versions of my own experiences. But such people aren\u2019t anywhere near a majority of students I\u2019ve interacted with. \n\nI do wonder what efforts could be done to make BYU a safer space for apostates, I think it already is safer than it was 5-10 years ago (Covid seems to have changed dynamics around enforcement of the Honor Code for the better), but institutional spaces like the Office of Belonging certainly won\u2019t provide that safety. There are good queer spaces that have cropped up, and those have been a substantial help for me, despite continued discrimination from the institution itself, so I think there\u2019s hope for the future. Maybe I\u2019ll write a letter or something to someone in power and publish it somewhere, just as a rallying cry for others. Not that I would have any interest in heading such a movement myself, but supporting others in similar efforts for sure.",

Give it a listen if you want! I'll add a link\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-exmormons-cant-leave-the-church-alone/id1626915660?i=1000567194316",

Ultimately, anger solves nothing and that loss must be processed to continue to live a healthy life. Hanging onto that resentment hurts no one but you.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m talking about actions in congruence with choices. Nothing of what I said disparages the choice to leave, only your actions *since* you\u2019ve left. If you\u2019re out, be out.

That\u2019s three years that he\u2019s taken advantage of a system he no longer contributes to or believes in.\n\nAnd literally 11 days ago you made a weird post about an apostle that is frankly based on nothing. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s a lot to criticize about Bednar.

Given his position as a moral leader I think it\u2019s fair to point something like that out. \n\nWe\u2019ll have to agree to disagree on the tuition thing, but consider that a person losing their belief still paid tithing in the past and quite possibly has parents and grandparents who continue to pay tithing. It\u2019s just not as cut-and-dried as you make it. And if there was an option for people to simply switch to the non-member tuition rate (vs getting kicked out) perhaps more people would come out of the woodwork. It\u2019s a difficult situation.",

It seems like the school is generally apathetic to antagonistic towards apostates depending on the person and situation (depending on whether or not our existence is acknowledged). If someone removes their records they're kicked out of the school, and I think bishops can just remove ecclesiastical endorsements at their discretion. There's a form somewhere to bypass the ecclesiastical endorsement if that happens, but I don't how well it works.  \nIt seems the general sentiment is to not let the administration/faculty know anything, and just find friends in similar situations for support.",

    "postText": "I will be going to BYU after I graduate this year and my goal is to become a speech pathologist, which has me taking communication sciences and disorders for my bachelor's. But, you have to apply for the program and they only accept around 100 each year. Has anyone applied? How competitive is it? How hard is it to make it into the program? I couldn't find any statistics on how many people applied.",

            "comment": "In general, you need a B or above in the pre-requisites. Usually, everyone who has applied can get into the program. The classes are Statistics 121, Human Anatomy, Acoustics (like sound physics), and a Intro to ComD seminar. The intro to ComD seminar has a cap of students to it per semester that is close to the number of students allowed into the ComD program each semester. \n\nI did the program and had horrible grades. Great program, I'm just a bad student. I think we had 110ish applicants that year, and I was allowed in with C's for Stat 121 and a C+ in Anatomy. \n\n ComD has an application process so that they can give high grades to students instead of having to grade them on a curve. From my understanding, general education classes need to have an overall class grade average of a B or B-. This does not apply for classes that are locked behind an application system like CommD, so everyone can get an A or A- average instead of having a strict curve requirement. \n\nIt's more complicated than that, but you'll be fine. Just take the pre-requisite classes, give them a good genuine effort, and you'll do great!",

And now they're all \"students are lazy now, what's up with that?\" instead of \"we haven't adjusted our student wages in maybe a decade, and students are responding to the job market and going places that pay them enough to survive. Maybe we should do pay our employees more.\"\n\nWhat's sad is that $12 is $2 more than what rates were for custodians pre-pandemic, and $0.70 more than I'm making now. It's not enough.",

A majority of people realized it was a light hearted attempt to get people's attention.There is, indeed, a shortage of workers across campus and the country.\n\nIf you think the flyer inferred that people playing video games are lazy, that was your inference. \n\nIf you disagree with the wage, that's fine, but the job currently pays more than most on campus jobs and the supervisors DON'T control those wages. Administration does. The wage does fit within the national average for such work. It's even higher than many places. \n\nWhat I find most appalling are the harassing and disgusting texts that this supervisor received from BYU students. People sending anonymous texts show their true personality. What is truly offensive in this situation is the lack of Christian love when one disagrees. And guess what? It had nothing to do with race, orientation, gender, gun control, politics or any other sensitive topic. If this is how students react in such a low key situation then I'm disheartened for the future of BYU campus. \n\nThe students working for custodial are generally amazing students who are a cut above all the whiners and harassers.",

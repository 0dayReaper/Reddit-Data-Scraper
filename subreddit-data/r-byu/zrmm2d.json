    "postText": "When I first visited Provo in the mid-2000s, my bishop mentioned to me that his daughter had enrolled at UVSC (as it was then known) because she didn't have the grades to get into BYU, but still wanted in on the Provo social scene. \n\nShe ended up transferring after just one year.\n\nHer UVSC classes were so easy, she felt like she was getting a fake education. It was easier than high school! \n\nAnd sure enough, when I was a freshman at BYU, I would always hear people call it \"UV High\" or \"that BYU-reject school\" because they mostly attracted marginal students who couldn't get into BYU.\n\nBut, in the past few years, I'm seeing a change: several local tech companies are hiring UVU CS graduates left and right and now they even have an engineering department. \n\nIs UVU becoming a respected public school on par with USU and the U? Have any of you attended UVU before? How does it compare to BYU?",

They don't care at all where you got your degree.\n\nThe main draw for elite universities isn't the quality of the education, it's the strength of the alumni network.",

It matters less as your career progresses, but you better believe a company will consider the MIT new grad more than the SLCC new grad during that resume filter stage. You might not even get to prove you have the skill set if you get filtered up front.",

You're not only paying for the education but the access to the University Network. The University has built up that network through Alumni, business partnerships, and reputation. UVU will lag behind for a while because both BYU and UofU have had over 150 years to build that reputation as Universities and their students benefit from that right out of the gate. It's easier to find a reference in some big companies if you have a connection to someone already working there from your alma mater. That's the advantage of established university brands.",

UVU's approach is a more hands-on practical skills-based approach, while BYU's program is more theoretical. UVU nursing students will have more experience out of the gate than BYU nursing graduates as they begin clinical rotations earlier in their program. BYU nursing is more selective, as UVU accepts more than twice as many students annually, and selectivity plays very much into how programs are ranked. But if local employers are favoring UVU nursing students when they hire, that says a lot. Source, I know students and faculty in both programs.",

Compared to BYU which has about 61% which is just shy a couple of points of the national average. Where the UofU has about 56% for the same numbers. Likely this is because UVU has a more generous admittance policy so it is more likely to draw on a wider array of folks that college might not work for and end up finding other ways to complete their education or start their career.",

Not to bash on the Church leadership but that is the outcome of that policy and inevitably will diminish the school. \n\nAs to being a non-member your opinion of your BYU experience is valid and your comments have added to this discussion.

College isn't for everyone and it doesn't need to be. Rather than dumbing it down and focusing on producing numbers, they should focus on producing quality graduates.  \n\n\nMaybe they can begin by having application criteria that demonstrate some degree of past academic success. They don't need to be as rigorous as U of U or BYU, but I think that's a change that could help. Or, if the goal is to make college accessible for all (not a bad goal), require anyone below a certain GPA or within other appropriate criteria to enroll in a first-year program that helps them develop study skills and that helps them understand and develop the skills they need to succeed in a university setting and beyond.",

The assumption was that local kids would still go to an in-state school with a high number of LDS students and a good institute program and have similar opportunities for spiritual growth.  Utah County kids at BYU were either faculty kids or had ACT scores in the 95th percentile, while students from further away had average scores around the 75th percentile.\n\nLocal kids went to UVU and the enrollment grew so much that the state had to give it more money to finance its growth.  UVU is a public school with open enrollment, so BYU students thought that UVU students were stupider because they couldn\u2019t get in to BYU and UVU students deferred because they mostly liked BYU and assumed that someone at BYU would be like one of the smartest kids from their high school who who passed 6 AP tests and was a Sterling scholar who got into BYU.  \n\nBYU has changed its admissions practices so it\u2019s easier for locals to get in, possibly because locals weren\u2019t bothering to apply because they didn\u2019t think they\u2019d get in.  Quite a few locals are resentful of BYU based on past BYU students being smug assholes from out of state, being happy with their own college experiences at UVU/USU/UU.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a huge difference between most BYU and UVU grads.  There are pockets of mediocrity in BYU\u2019s faculty where some programs put out mediocre graduates compared to other schools.  There were also big cuts to public funding of higher education about a decade ago so there weren\u2019t as many teaching and research positions at universities, there\u2019s a big cohort of PhDs working as adjunct faculties at multiple schools.  The same adjunct instructor with a PhD from an Ivy League school might be teaching the same class at BYU and SLCC and UVU.",

They offer doctoral degrees, they spend a ton of money on research programs (BYU mostly for undergrads, Utah mostly for their graduate students), and they specifically hire faculty with that in mind. A lot of the kids that go to BYU and Utah end up doing graduate school at some point (BYU is in the top 5 in the country for students who go on to get PhDs, if I recall correctly), and their programs are tailored with that in mind.\n\nUVU is focused on getting local kids into the kinds of jobs Utah needs. If a kid wants to go to grad school, that's great, but that's not the focus. If a kid wants to do research, that's great, too, but the options will be very limited; better apply for a summer REU at someplace like BYU. The primary goal is just to get the kid a degree and enough technical expertise to get a good job right out of school.",

I would be lying to you if I said I was planning on going to UVU for my undergrad, but due to some finical reasons I decided to stay in state. I was accepted to every university in the state (excluding Westminster) and I\u2019ll go down the reasons why I chose UVU over BYU \n\n1. UVU\u2019s ability to find niche programs is outstanding. As a National Security Major, I\u2019ve been able to work with some really impressive clients. UVU is the only school in the West Coast that supports a National Security Program, and it has punched well above its weight in terms of representation. Also the cyber/ai/vr degrees are getting a ton of investment, and are improving rapidly \n\n2. I think there is a pretentious culture at BYU that has inhibited their growth. When I interact with both students and faculty there (obviously i\u2019m generalizing a little bit) I feel they project the quality of education is significantly better then most just because it\u2019s BYU. I think that has slowed the growth at the university \n\n3. This is more a personal reason, but I didn\u2019t feel welcome at BYU. As a inactive member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints (attempting to honor the name) I didn\u2019t feel welcome by a lot of the BYU students I met. Though UVU still has a large religious population I personally feel that it prioritizes a open flow of ideas that really makes it a more welcome environment.",

            "comment": "BYU is an LDS college. 40% of Utahans aren't LDS and 60% of the US members are inactive. Equating that last number to Utah could be maybe 30%. Thats already a ton of people not wanting/able to go there cuz its a religious institution. Not to mention UVU serves a much diverse base of students due to not having a history of predijudce. People from UVU are hired over from BYU because the only difference is UVU actually provides for its community while BYU a biggitoted institution.\n\n Also, basing a schools ability to how \"hard\" someone thinks a class is is a poor standard. People consider things hard usually in college because the teachers don't teach well, that says more about BYU than UVU. U of U has recognition due to its research, UVU due to its consistent expansion and community accessibility, and BYU (this post here is an example) is know for being arrogant. You can get a degree in sociology without having to take a gender studies course at BYU. Gender is the building block of social relationships and interactions. The school is so far behind, UVU isn't getting better. Its alway been good and BYU is just falling behind because it can't catch up with the times.",

I would say it\u2019s quite respected. 3rd or 4th for Utah, it\u2019s competing with Utah State rn. \n\nBetween that and what I perceive to be a slow decline in respect for BYU I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if in 20 years UVU is seen as the more favorable school. \n\nAnd honestly it deserves it IMO. It\u2019s a nice place nowadays\n\nFor my major BYU is objectively better (Geography). But for a growing number of majors that isn\u2019t true, for a couple UVU is better.",

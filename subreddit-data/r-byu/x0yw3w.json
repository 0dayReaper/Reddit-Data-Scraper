It\u2019s a trek getting to the WCCB and it\u2019s not worth it to go back to the main campus to only be there for 30 or so minutes just to walk/shuttle back. Are there any established study spaces there or is sitting outside or the hallways the best option currently (I\u2019ve heard people saying they\u2019re planning on making something to that extent but I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s already something available)?",

It's located behind the Art and Design department office. You can find it by going down the hall where advisement is or the hall south of the art and design main office.",

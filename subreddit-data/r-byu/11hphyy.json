When I was applying to college, I had a huge stack of fan-mail from all of those top-notch schools. I didn't even apply anywhere other than BYU. I was grateful to be accepted and loved my time in Provo. 12 years after graduating from BYU, I have no regrets about that decision. The value relative to the cost was a huge factor for me.",

Their parents worry that they will leave the LDS church if they go to a different school. This happens all the time, though it's probably more likely that their children were *already* leaving the church and thus chose to go to a different school.\n2. Their parents can't/aren't willing to pay for out of state schools. BYU is definitely the best school in Utah.\n3. They're told the most  important thing in their life is to get married. Where else can they find faithful people to marry?\n4. It's trickier to work out missions with other schools.\n\nUltimately, BYU is a decent school--I'd probably place it in the top 40 in the US--but I don't think yield rate is the best metric to measure its quality.",

If they could go to MIT, Caltech, Stanford, etc. they would love to, but financially they realize it's impossible. So they end up with BYU as their *only* choice. And it's a great choice. But that doesn't mean the average accepted applicant actually wants to go to BYU more than the average adMIT.\n\nI think graduation rates show this pretty well. Only about 59% of BYU students graduate, vs. 95% for MIT. Maybe a more conservative culture means many students drop out to start families, but certainly not 35%!",

Realistically, you should swap the 4 and 6-year rates for 6 and 8-year rates to get the same picture. BYU's 6-year graduation rate is just above 60%, and their 8-year is just shy of 85%. Their freshman retention rate is 90%, so realistically you're only looking at losing an additional 5% over the next seven years.\n\nFor example, I left on my mission in October 2013, got home in October 2015, and thus didn't start school until January 2016. Due to my intention to go to graduate school, my advisor and I mutually agreed it was better for me to extend a semester (and then a summer so that I could keep working as an RA for him) rather than graduate in December 2019 and have eight months of downtime. But even if I had graduated in December 2019, I wouldn't have been included in the 6-year graduation rate as I was admitted as a student (and actually registered for classes until my call came) in 2013.\n\nEDIT: grammatical typo",

For example, I took 4.5 years to graduate from BYU, but I didn't enroll until five semesters after I was admitted because of my mission. Depending on when you start counting, I might not show up until the eight-year graduation rate.",

I definitely toned down my original post as well before submitting it.\n\nI would like to correct a misconception, though--I don't dislike BYU. Personally, my time at BYU was great. The campus is nice, the people are kind, and the professors care very much about their students. Ultimately, however, I had to leave when I realized that the LDS church is false. I didn't want to live a lie, and I knew that I'd get kicked out if I didn't.\n\n  \nWould you mind explaining which parts about my first post you don't think are true and I should correct? Thanks.",

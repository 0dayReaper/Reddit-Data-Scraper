It is especially problematic to assume that a set of rules for one group might mean it is doctrine for another. This is how BYU Dining services choice to not serve caffeinated beverages as conflated as church doctrine. It's not uncommon that these policies become a hedge around the law and then are assumed to be doctrine. It is unfortunate that this rule was implied to be a standard for the church. \n\nWhile the ASB was a dedicated building, not as a building for church services, there are many dedicated buildings where you can wear hats. Additionally dedication does not equal that something is a church. Apostles and priesthood leaders have dedicated monuments, visitors centers, graves, and even sports stadiums. I'm not sure you'd convince anyone to take off their ball cap at the Baseball fields or at LaVell Edwards Stadium (Honestly that place needs some shade)  \n\nAs to church buildings themselves, nowhere in any of the current church handbooks are there references to a prohibition on wearing hats. Even in our doctrine there is nothing referencing removing a hat to pray. We are only encouraged to show reverence. There are many religious practices we inherited from our ancestors and those outside of the faith. They are not bad things and can do many good things but if they lead us towards judging others as unworthy because they don't do something the way we do then they are a stumbling block to our progression.   \n\n\nSo there is not doctrine against wearing hats in dedicated buildings or even church  and camps-camplike programs have asked their participants to not wear hats.    \n\n\nSo if the OP wants to wear a hat on campus and even in buildings they are welcome to.",

Today I found that if it is enabled, LearningSuite immediately errors and won't let me access the site until I turn it back off. Anyone else seen that (or any OIT workers have some insight)?",

I don't work in the department that would probably do that, but its not something I hear anyone talk about at all. We use our own VPN for work-related things anyway, and there are other campus VPN's (such as the CS VPN). Not sure how they could filter between 'good' VPN's and 'bad' VPNs.",

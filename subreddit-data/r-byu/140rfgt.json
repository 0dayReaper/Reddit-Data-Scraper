            "comment": "Like others have mentioned, BYU has already selected a new president.  Moreover, because the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints owns BYU, the Church\u2019s leadership selects a president.  In a 1996 interview with Elder L. Tom Perry (one of the church leaders at the time) said, \u201cWe were united in the opinion that BYU is different from any other university. It has the charge of building faith in the gospel and achieving high academic excellence in its students. Our first requirement for the president of the university was to find a person who could provide leadership in both areas. The second requirement was to provide a strong administrator who had both an academic and business background. BYU is a big business operation and requires large financial support from the Church\u201d (here\u2019s the article I got the quote from: https://magazine.byu.edu/article/selecting-a-president-an-interview-with-elder-l-tom-perry/).\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s not an application to be president for BYU because the process for finding a new president is different than how public universities may find their candidates.",

If you play your cards right (make sure everyone in your stake pays their tithing and your stake spends less than other stakes) you\u2019ll be elevated to area 70 and then to 70\n\n4) At this point start preaching to powerful executives and see if you can get them and their corporations to donate to BYU and explore partnerships with BYU. \n\n5) Cosy up to the 12 Apostles",

He has a PhD in statistics from Texas A&amp;M, turned down offers to work in the private sector, and has never been a general authority or even a stake president (is a counselor is a stake presidency). \n\nBut the 12 do love him I\u2019m sure because he is genuine and cares very deeply for the BYU community, and has been involved in a lot of awesome transformational work around campus. Took his Stats class and it was amazing.",

But if you look at those before him, the majority had huge law or corporate careers, along the lines of my argument above.\n\nAnd out of all of them, Bateman was the one who took BYU into the 21st century with his focus on technology, something that the following presidents didn\u2019t understand as much. Hopefully Reese will push more in that direction.",

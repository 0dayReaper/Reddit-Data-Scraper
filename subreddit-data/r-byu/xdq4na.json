    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nJust got a board again after a long hiatus. I know you can\u2019t skateboard on campus, but do you know of any covered basketball or tennis courts or anything close by (like maybe at a school or something) where I could skateboard while it\u2019s raining? \n\nNot asking for anything indoors, but just a covered area. Don\u2019t want to miss out this fall and winter just due to rainy days and not having a garage due to living in an apartment. \n\nThanks!",

They have more regular security patrols though.",

Maybe it\u2019s because the campus was so barren this early I was too easy to see? I have a 9 o\u2019clock class that I was heading to. Are you skating in between classes more in the middle of the day?",

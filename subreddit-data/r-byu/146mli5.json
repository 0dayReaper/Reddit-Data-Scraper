I heard Heritage has a new basement bike garage system, is there anything like that at Heleman? Just trying to find a way to store my bike somewhere it won\u2019t get stolen.",

You probably didn't due to the weekend but calling and asking for the specific building would probably be your best option.\n\nRegardless of how it's stored, consider registering it with the BYU police. They have a form to record information in the case it is ever found.",

My dad says that his scholarship was upgraded from half to full his freshman year after he committed and thinks it\u2019s possible for me too. Lots of my friends with similar high 30 act scores didn\u2019t receive a scholarship at all. Do you guys think BYU is just being stingy with plans to give more money later?",

Many freshman have high 30s ACT scores and near perfect GPAs, so scholarships are very competitive to get. You can definitely apply for a full-tuition scholarship after a semester/year if your GPA is high enough (plan for a 4.0 GPA).",

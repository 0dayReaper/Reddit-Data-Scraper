Is it? Are there better sources to check of? Thanks in advance!",

Jeff Hanson is kinda as good as it gets though (which is fine since he teaches amazingly). \n\nCCE 203 is a hard class. You'll get a lot out of videos, but make sure you go to the TA lab often. If you plan on becoming a structural engineer, this class is the foundation for everything you'll do the next couple years.",

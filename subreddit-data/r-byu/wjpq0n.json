    "postText": "Hey friends. If anybody can answer these questions, I would appreciate it.\n\nLong story short, in February a signed a lease with a BYU-contracted off-campus housing complex, for the 2022-23 school year. Shortly after they became non-BYU-contracted. I am a transfer student. I now know students are required to live in BYU-contracted housing their first two semesters. Hence the problem, lol. But-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I filed a petition with the housing office explaining the situation- what are the odds they approve me living in non-contracted housing?\n2. If they don't approve it, can I just pay a fee? I've heard there's like a 30 dollar fee. If that's the case, no reason to worry lol.\n\nThanks y'all.",

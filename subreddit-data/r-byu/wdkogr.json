My wife and I are students and bought the ROC pass last year but ended up only using\nit to attend the football games and nothing else. With the ROC pass costing $150 is it cheaper to buy individual tickets to the six home games? Thanks in advance \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

Last year my dad had one guest pass and bought individual tickets for my brother (he'd even buy nosebleeds and have my brother squeeze into the ROC), and the guest pass definitely won out. The Utah game alone basically.",

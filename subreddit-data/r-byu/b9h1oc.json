The Honor Code office needs a complete 180 degree shift in its nature. Rather than their purpose being to police students and enforce the honor code under threat of expulsion, the honor code office should exist as a neutral safe zone for students who need help living the honor code. Basically they should dissolve the current office and replace it with a bunch of therapists that can serve as a resource to students for mental, emotional, and behavioral wellness. No more Pharisees and replace them with a more Christ-like love. \n\nThis would also qualify as a return to an actual HONOR CODE, where students are expected to maintain standards on their own honor as opposed to having \u201chonor\u201d forced upon them. \n\nI think your ideas maintain the \u201cstudents vs honor code\u201d nature. We shouldn\u2019t need an attorney with our own honor code office. ",

Protesting is not polite, it\u2019s not convenient for anybody, and it doesn\u2019t make those in power happy. That\u2019s the point. The administration will never provide a viable alternative for changing things because they have no incentive to change the structures that protect their positions. They will say there are better, more civil ways to voice your concerns, but will fail to show how those alternatives actually produce results. So, protest it is. ",

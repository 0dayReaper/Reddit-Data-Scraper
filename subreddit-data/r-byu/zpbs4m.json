    "postText": "I was a lazy student in high school, did terribly in my one semester at BYU-Idaho 4 years ago, that was 13 credits and I had a 0.88 gpa (ouch).\n\nSince then, I have served a mission, and have went back to school at one of the most reputable community colleges in the country. I have maintained a 4.0 GPA in multiple honors courses, with a total of 33 credits at this institution.\n\nI worry that my one semester at Rexburg is forever going to be an inescapable albatross. Will BYU admissions take into consideration my mission and complete turnaround?",

You really should try to get an associates or be as close to an associates as possible. 33 credits isn\u2019t a great indication academic performance even with a 4.0 and honors. I transferred with a 3.9 and one credit short of an associates and no trouble getting in.",

Then I joined the Church, went on a mission, and came home and have a 4.0 from Ensign College. I think if you can tell a compelling story in your essays you'd be a great candidate for BYU. I think you definitely have a shot to get in. They ignore your high school grades if you are transferring with more than 24 credit hours.",

If you can't get these insecurities off your mind, consider writing an extra essay about why your grades were lower than you thought.\n\nI would also say in this case, consider finding an essay reviewer/ application coach online (only if you can afford it.) Your essay is really going to come in clutch. A powerful essay can change the entire game. It wasn't an essay but I remember when I applied to private school in high school I got 99th percentile on the reading part of the standardized entrance exam test, and the admissions officer paused the interview to walk around to the other offices nearby saying \"look at this! look at this!\" The people holding the door open/closed to BYU are human, and everyone has a chance at getting in.\n\nHope you do get in cuz it's clear you really want to.",

Just make sure you mention how your overcame the struggle of bad grades and talk about why BYU. We all do mistakes and you improving shows makes a solid case of why you should get admitted. Just admit failure and write you overcame it.\n\nEdit: Best of luck and hope you get in",

Came home, retook 2 of my bad classes, did 18-20 credits of engineering each semester, and got my institute diploma (HIGHLY recommend if transferring to BYU). Applied to BYU with my AS at 3.7 and got in. I was friends with an editing major that proof-read my essays. So maybe look into taking your essays to your school's writing lab if you have one.",

I tried to stress in one of my essays that even though I don't have as many accolades as other applicants, my transcripts reflect my journey as a student/person and where I am now. If you incorporate something like that in your essay try to be specific in what you learned and how you've grown. I think examples help show authenticity. If you just say I've changed without giving some clear examples of what you've learned it won't hold any weight.",

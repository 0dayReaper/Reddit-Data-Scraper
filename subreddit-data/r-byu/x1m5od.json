I wasn\u2019t planning on going to school right away, I\u2019m going on a mission first, but I do plan on applying again. Does anyone have any advice on how I could get in this time around?   Is there anyone who got rejected once and then was admitted later on. Any anecdotes or advice would be appreciated.",

It really sucked though honestly, because it was truly one of my favorite classes.

I had undiagnosed anxiety and ADHD, which meant that I just straight up didn\u2019t even start a lot of those papers. I would avoid and avoid and avoid, until it was impossible for me to complete any kind of paper before the deadline. \n\nThat was really hard for me to swallow, because I felt like my lack of completion on the essays and subsequent terrible grade in the class did not reflect my level of learning or interest in the course at all. I could handle the bad grades in the other classes, but my D in American Heritage stung especially hard.",

I got rejected in high school, planned to go to BYUH instead, went on my mission, reapplied while on my mission, then got accepted about a week before I came home. I think the big difference between my two applications was the quality of my essays. I obviously put effort into my essays while in high school, but I didn\u2019t get them proofread, I didn\u2019t ask for suggestions from family, and I didn\u2019t tailor them to BYU. Second time around, I made sure to get them proofread, I accepted suggestions without allowing myself to be offended by their corrections, and I made sure that the topics I chose for my essays would show BYU that I would be an asset to THEIR school. You need to give them reason to accept you over other applicants. What are you going to bring to their campus? Anyways, GPA and ACT were the same of course, but somehow they liked me better the second time, and I think that has everything to do with essays. I know that isn\u2019t the general rule for everyone, but that\u2019s how it went for me.",

She also was a bit more thoughtful about who to have write her letters of recommendation and provided them with a ton of info about her and her accomplishments.  About two weeks ago she was admitted for winter semester so it seems to have worked.  Her GPA was 3.65 so she knew she was kind of right on the bubble anyways.  So My suggestion would be to look at your application and try to find those places where you can strengthen things.  You probably can't change grades, but you can improve essays, improve test scores, get different letters, maybe involve yourself in projects/activities that would help you stand out, etc.",

The admissions decisions that BYU makes may not make sense to us, where 2 students with the same grades and test scores have one get in and the other rejected. BYU is a great school, but it\u2019s not the only school. Don\u2019t put your life and future career on hold based on some arbitrary decision made by someone who doesn\u2019t know you.

Get good grades (all A's) there and then reapply and you'll have a much higher chance of getting in. That's how my friend and I did it after we were denied.",

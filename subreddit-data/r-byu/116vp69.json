I assume her status probably changed on the backend from applicant to student, so now it's requiring 2-factor.  But she's never enrolled with DUO previously, and it's not obvious how to do that now.  We have been to the [duo.byu.edu](https://duo.byu.edu) website and it's not helpful.  Any ideas?  Do we have to wait until the IT office opens on Monday??",

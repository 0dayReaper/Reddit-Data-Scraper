It\u2019s a higher ranking school. What are your reasons for wanting to transfer? If you are getting Bs on average at BYUI, you will very likely get somewhat lower grades at BYU. Some programs you have to get into, and you wouldn\u2019t be able to do that with those grades. But, many programs are open and grades don\u2019t matter nearly as much. I wouldn\u2019t say you have no chance at all, but administration at both schools might not think it\u2019s in your best interest to switch either.",

I was able to tour around BYU-P but was unimpressed by the university and unprofessionalism that I experienced. I bit the bullet and decided to test my luck again with BYU the following cycle. Luckily I got in and my experience has been amazing. The spirit flourishes here, something I didn\u2019t quite feel at BYU-P, I would strongly recommend staying at BYU where education is the schools #1 priority.",

It\u2019s a heavier load than the individual normal class would be, but the combination of all the classes makes it super interesting and compliments each other. If you\u2019re looking to do acme then definitely consider taking it, but be sure that\u2019s what you want because it is a ton of math and heavier concepts",

It would prepare you for acme much better than cs 142, and I think it also fulfils that requirement in a much more friendly environment.",

At the same time, learning C++ felt like a huge boon for my later computer stuff. As great as Python is for research applications and ease of use, I can't imagine what going to a CS course like 235 without any C++ background would be like.",

            "comment": "I took the program several years ago and I\u2019ve generally kept tabs on the program ever since. I agree with the other person that the professors are great. The department picks some of the best professors to teach the classes. \n\nI disagree that the load is heavier, but it\u2019s good to get multiple perspectives so that you can make an educated choice. Sometimes the professors teaching those classes will put in new topics that they love that you won\u2019t see if you took the class regularly, but aside from those additions (which are mostly cool, not hard workload-wise) I didn\u2019t really feel like the classes were harder than the regular version. I didn\u2019t take the regular version though, so I don\u2019t have anything to compare against. You\u2019ll also have a built-in group of 20-30 people that you\u2019re taking 3 classes with, so it\u2019s super easy to make study groups and regularly do your homework with others. In the past they\u2019ve had an entire study room just for EMC2 students, which they\u2019ll probably continue into the future. I found the social part of EMC2 especially helpful my freshman year. I\u2019m still friends with some people I met through the program.\n\nWhen I took the program, I felt like I had plenty of time. Not all the time in the world since I was, after all, a college student, but certainly a lot more than I had in later years. I only worked a few hours a week though, so I don\u2019t know how difficult it would feel if you wanted to balance 20hrs a week with school. The combination of 2 math classes + 1 math adjacent class is also pretty common for math majors (especially acme), so you\u2019ll have to get used to that load eventually. \n\nAside from the great professors and community, the biggest addition that the program gives you is the Python coding labs (math 495r). The labs especially are really helpful for anyone going into acme. The acme labs are in Python, and EMC2 even stole a few labs from the acme program. The labs typically go along with the content in the math classes, which can also help you understand the math at a better level. One con though is that I don\u2019t think that the labs count a lot towards graduation (for math I was only able to count 2 credits of 495r as elective math, and acme may not even take it at all towards anything). But the payoff that you get from learning how to program, especially learning it for math contexts, early on in school is very very high, so I feel like it\u2019s worth it. You might also be able to get 495r to count for any computer science class requirements for acme, but I\u2019m not 100% sure how that all works. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t programmed at all, the beginning of the semester can be a little bit rough in that class, but a lot of students haven\u2019t programmed before so you won\u2019t be alone in that. If you want to make that go a little smoother, I\u2019d recommend trying to learn a little bit of Python now. There are probably some online tutorials you could find. Trying to solve some of the first ~50 or so problems on projecteuler.net is a great way to built some mathematical programming skills. The problems are sometimes tricky, but usually rewarding. You could show up the first day never having written a line of code and people would help you learn, but I personally think the \u201cbaptism by fire\u201d on the coding front is probably the hardest part of EMC2. I had fortunately learned some Python in high school, which made the labs less frustrating (but still hard). There\u2019s also a grad student who runs the labs that you can ask for help. \n\nOverall, I absolutely love this program and highly recommend it to everyone that can take it. (I\u2019m also probably a little biased because of this love, so definitely read other people\u2019s responses.) If you decide at the end of the program that you hate math or something, you\u2019ll also have completed a math minor and most STEM math prereqs, so pivoting isn\u2019t too bad.\n\nThanks for reading my essay, haha.",

The past few years it\u2019s been 12-2pm (not sure if that\u2019s the case this year but probably so). In my experience most of the social stuff is in the evenings, like clubs and any ward activities. The only thing you may miss is any on-campus activities like \u201cthere\u2019s free cookies at xyz quad\u201d but those types of things usually run over multiple hours so you can probably snag some anyways.\n\nHonestly though, I think you\u2019ll run into this kind of schedule with any classes you take. The vast majority of 3 credit required classes are MWF (unless you\u2019re in the business school\u2014I think they have Fridays off for networking events). Most students are running on this kind of schedule, so everyone is going to be planning their social events around their classes. You could always skip class of course\u2026but you really really shouldn\u2019t get into the habit of doing that your first year because your grades will suffer.",

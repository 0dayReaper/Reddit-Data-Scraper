    "postText": "I know the past few weeks have been rough for BYU and BYU Athletics (and, just as a caveat, I 100% agree with our recent statement that we all need to be better and work together to create a safe, inclusive environment at BYU).\n\nHowever, going to the BYU Baylor game last night reminded me of what makes BYU great\u2014I believe that \\*most\\* BYU fans, at their core, are kind (if imperfect) people who want to make the world a better place. \n\nThere were so many things to love about last night\u2014the enthusiasm in the stadium was insane, and I sat by a bunch of Baylor fans who told me that we were the nicest fanbase they've ever interacted with (which is so good to hear!)\n\nThe best part of the night, though, was at the very end, when Jaren Hall walked over to Jake Oldroyd, who was bawling his eyes out, and gave him a huge hug.\n\nFor context, Oldroyd had missed two field goals (one at the end of regulation, one in the first overtime) that would have won us the game. I'm sure he was absolutely devastated as we headed into the second overtime. That kind of mistake can weigh heavily on a player. \n\nWhen we won the game, you could tell Oldroyd was absolutely relieved. Jaren Hall walked over to him and held him. What a stellar leader and teammate!\n\nAlthough BYU fans aren't perfect and we definitely have lots of room for change and growth, I also believe that my time at BYU taught me how to be a better person, leader, and friend. I hope moving forward that we can all emulate Jaren's example, because that is the kind of BYU that I want to represent!!",

He was on his phone for most of the second match, and after she notified BYU, they sent a police officer to stand by him (who never heard him say anything). Two of my friends were right in front of him and never heard him say anything other than regular BYU cheers. I think it's totally possible that the Duke volleyball player genuinely misheard the racial slur in the heat of the moment. She didn't play well, even before the match where she said she heard the slur, and our student section was very loud. I can see how it would be so easy to hear that word in a constant chant of \"Go Cougars.\" Two of her teammates (one of them who is Black) even went on the record to say that they never heard it (but that they stand by her). Our security team/ushers were on high alert after the second match, and we had a Duke administrator in our student section as well. I simply don't believe we could have multiple students chanting it over and over with no repercussions (or without someone filming it on their phone; it's 2022 for heaven's sake). Especially because a bunch of our Black basketball players were front and center in the student section the whole time. I think it was most likely a genuine mistake. Not sure how much more thorough this investigation could be, honestly. BYU has invited people to come forward multiple times and no one has.",

On top of that, everyone's lives and experiences are unique and can't be generalized with the rest of a community or population.\n\nReligion bashing is very popular on Reddit and the exmormon/athiest user base is very active and many of them would love to watch the church burn and then have BYU secularized into a state school with a name change.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m planning on taking one of these 2 classes this summer to fulfill an engineering requirement for my major at another institution. Does anyone have any advice about which class to take? I\u2019m confident in my understanding of calculus to succeed in physics with calculus, but it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done physics. All I need is a C so I\u2019d like to take whichever class I can get through as quickly an easily as possible. Any thoughts?",

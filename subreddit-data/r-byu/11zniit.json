I'm surprised they still manage to make this event work given the recent climate of brotheren trying to tighten up the school's directioon to be more orthodox than before. Props to the students and faculties that make this conversation possible and pray for our LGBTQ students in the BYU community!",

Does make me sad though that queer event fliers have to have quotes from a general authority and can't use rainbows at all. I appreciate everything that y'all at PEN talks do, I just wish admin would make it easier for all of us trying to help students at BYU :(",

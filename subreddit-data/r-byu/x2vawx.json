I believe it should be the other way around. Don\u2019t you think this whole incident has been gaslighting then fan who was banned from all byu sports venues for being scapegoated? There\u2019s no evidence anyone yelled a slur. If anyone was dumb enough to yell a slur loud enough for the players to hear (which would be loud enough for the fans) then I know for certain people would tell them to stop and phones would immediately be pulled out to film it. Police are begging for people to bring forward a video showing the slur. No one has come forward. Why? Because it didn\u2019t happen! \n\nThe reality is byu did address the situation quite a bit when unlike the initial reports. They took it seriously. The reason the lack of action from police or fans was because it didn\u2019t happen. Further, it\u2019s a horrible look for byu that they banned a fan before finding any evidence of the accusation. \n\nShe said at one point the threats intensified but the police report says he was on his phone during that part. \n\n I would say I know for a fact people would tell I only feel bad that she has a godmother who probably pressured her to make this claim so her campaign can get a boost. Her godmother is also a total racist.",

I also believe in innocent until proven guilty, so until I see real evidence, I won't believe that he actually said it but I also won't believe that the Duke player just made everything up to hurt BYU. So far they both could easily be innocent in my mind.",

I waited until all the facts were out to make my judgement on the matter. Now it is clear to me that she is a liar with much to gain from all of this press. None of her story amounts to \u201ca simple misunderstanding\u201d. She was very specific about the increasing intensity and frequency of the slur. Which over 100 people have confirmed is false. Along with the BYUtv 24 channel mic setup. Along with the correlation of no bystander video. Or intervention from duke staff, or the neutral line judges. Or the police.",

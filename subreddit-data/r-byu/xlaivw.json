Shop fronts would bring their wares out into the streets, restraunts would universally have outdoor seating, and the space was there for anybody to enjoy. With car dominance taking place over the decades after WWII, these public spaces were taken and converted to extra lanes for traffic. So long as these events keep occurring, those in charge of our infrastructure are responsible for the killing and maiming caused by cars",

BYU students are known for being careless on the streets, whether on foot or by car. They'll walk right into the street without looking even when there's no crosswalk, but they'll also barrel right through crowded streets where there are crosswalks without thinking twice.  \n\n\nBoth automobile drivers and pedestrians need to be more careful on the streets.",

Those things are a pain to navigate in wheelchairs or with other mobility issues.\n\nThe answer lies in physical infrastructure changes that force cars to go the speed limit. Signs do nothing. Raise the road up to sidewalk level at intersections to serve as speed bumps and a reminder that the space is prioritizing people, not cars. Make the roads skinnier. Add trees to make a tunnel-like feel that causes people to naturally slow down. Stuff like that.\n\nWe've sacrificed walkability all throughout the country so cars can get where they're going 30 seconds faster. It's time to take the streets back for people, not metal monstrosities.",

Most people who are jaywalking are looking for a gap and no that they shouldn't be crossing so they wait. If they are at a crosswalk then you have time to see them approaching and can stop most of the time\n\n I think that the timid pedestrians are way way worse. I've come to a complete stop for a pedestrian, as I'm legally required to do, and they look at me, think about crossing, and then wave me passed because they don't want to cause me any inconvenience or something. I'm already fully stopped, just cross already.\n\nAlso, you can start walking while I'm slowing down. So many people wait until you have come to a full stop when they would have already gone across and back if they had just gone when they saw that I had seen them and started to decelerate. \n\nAnd another annoying habit they have is to wait for all the cars to come to a complete stop. I've been stuck at an intersection while 8 cars drive through the other way because the pedestrian won't go until everyone in the area comes to a complete stop. I used to be upset with the other cars but then I noticed that you're only required to stop for adults on your side of the street so it is 100% the fault of the pedestrian.\n\nI wish that more people would just walk out in the appropriate crosswalk but drivers keep hitting them because they aren't paying attention and scaring them into wasting the time of the drivers who are aware.",

So definitely drive the speed limit and be actively looking for people approaching the crosswalk. Don't be the jerk who sees someone waiting to cross and doesn't stop.\n\nHOWEVER, as a pedestrian, even though you have the right of way, you don't necessarily have the right to step directly in front of oncoming traffic when entering the crosswalk:\n\n\"You cannot create a hazard by abruptly entering the path of a vehicle\" (41-6a-1002).\n\nAs another note, it isn't illegal to cross a road without using the cross walk in all situations:\n\n\"Jaywalking is defined as crossing at any point other than a marked crosswalk if you are between two adjacent intersections with traffic lights\" (41-6a-1003).\n\nIntersections include 3-ways which is what a lot of the South side of campus entails. Many of those intersections do not include lights, meaning it's actually legal to cross at most places on that road. However, as a pedestrian you MUST yield to vehicles when crossing at a non-designated location:\n\n\"When crossing outside a marked or unmarked crosswalk, you must yield to all vehicles on the roadway\" (41-6a-103).\n\nIn brief, just be smart.

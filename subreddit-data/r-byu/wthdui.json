I read there are underground bike storage on campus but on the housing website they didn\u2019t elaborate that much on them. Is this a smart idea.",

I know some people cover their nice bikes in duct tape or something to make it look worse without actually damaging the frame, but I was talking to a university officer the other day who said that thieves have figured out that trick and have started targeting taped bikes, so I dunno.",

I have a pretty hefty lock for it that I thread through the front wheel, the frame, and the bike rack whenever I park it. There are lots of good places to do this on campus. I had the same worries you do, so I wrapped the frame in black electrical tape to make it look kinda crappy. Nothings happened to me yet, but there's always a possibility something will happen.",

There are few places close to Provo but most of the good places are going to be a few hours of Driving and so there isn't a high need for something nice. If you really have a hankering you can rent a bike (Not the best in the world but adequate) from Outdoors Unlimited.",

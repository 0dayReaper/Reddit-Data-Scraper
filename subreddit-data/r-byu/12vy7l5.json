    "postText": "I\u2019ve been at BYU for a few years now, and I just submitted my final project and assignments for BIO 100. What an absolute joke of a class and a massive waste of time. I can confidently say that I learned absolutely nothing at all, and essentially felt the exact same as the English class I took my junior year in high school. Not a single speck of information was new to me whatsoever, and the last biology class I took was my freshman year of high school in 2013. I BSd more essays for this class than probably any other class I\u2019ve taken in my life, including the freshman writing class. I put in minimal effort because I found that there was nothing to get out of the class, and I didn\u2019t even do the last weeks assignments because my grade was so high I\u2019ll probably still end with an A. What an absolute waste of time of a class.\n\nEdit: I am not at all saying I\u2019m a genius in biology or something or that school is easy for me. It\u2019s not. I\u2019m complaining that I paid money to go to school and I signed up for a required general education class that was taught by a graduate student who genuinely did not seem interested in teach at all.",

            "comment": "I took BIO 100 last year, and I 1000% believe it should remain a required class. On top of learning about the world around us (just a little important), it teaches you how to THINK. My class spent an entire lecture learning about how evolution and the Church can and do coexist, and a lot of people were surprised to learn that. It answered questions for me that I\u2019d had for a very long time.\n\nYou\u2019re making the exact same argument kids in high school used to make about not needing to take math classes because they were never going to use them. It\u2019s not about what you\u2019re learning necessarily, but those classes teach you how to learn; how to look at things analytically. Same thing with this class. \n\nI\u2019m a psychology research assistant, and let me tell you right now that the things I thought I wouldn\u2019t use from that class, I use every single day, even in a different area of study from biology. Please check your ego, realize that you are not all-knowing, and hope that your cockiness about your grades does not come back to bite you in the butt.",

But really, that's not a problem with BYU. It's just a problem with GenEds as a concept, especially the courses that are designed to be GenEds. They are made expressly for the lowest common denominator, and that's not bad. They are the minimum that someone should have the experience of learning or coming into contact with, even if the rest of what they do in the rest of their education or career never has anything to do with it. \n\nYou are majoring in something math and science heavy, yeah? I'm assuming you didn't just suddenly find an interest in science and math in between high school and college. So you probably actually paid attention in high school when you were taught biology. I did too. But I know I didn't care about history one bit. I phoned in history constantly and barely did enough to get the grades that I wanted. Similarly, there are those who, while in highschool, couldn't have cared less about biology, or physics, or math or whatever. And they are taking the Bio100 class to fill a requirement now, and the requirement is there to try and give them an opportunity to have a basic understanding, maybe learn some skills that can be applied to things outside of biology, and so on and so forth.\n\nThat is to say, really I think it's your own fault. You chose the first option that comes up on MyMap for the requirement. These classes are not designed to be super challenging. The reason why people can find GenEds to be harder than some of their more advanced major courses is because they are interested in their major and their not interested in the GenEd. Or because they have already invested hours upon hours in learning about their major and they haven't done so with a GenEd topic. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong. Maybe you actually hate biology and hated it in high school. But I think that really you're disappointed you didn't learn more because you actually like the subject. So for future reference, if you like the subject, find a more specialized class to take. It'll be more technical and aimed towards teaching more domain specific stuff. Scroll through the options and read some. Be active in your education. First year writing would be just as boring for an English major I'm sure. GenEd music would be worthless to a music major. \n\nAnd the professors will be more enthusiastic in the non default classes since they get students who actually care!",

I took the basic one because my other classes are absolutely killer and I didn\u2019t care enough to take a specialized course but I did still want to learn something, not just be handed a bunch of busy work and not taught anything.",

Just realize that a GenEd will not be especially advanced in any way. I don't know what kind of work you had to do, maybe nobody in your class had to learn anything and maybe it was all coloring sheet of cool looking animals or something. But let's face it, you took the most basic class that would fulfill the requirement. \n\nIf you're upset at the amount of work you had to do I agree with you. I think it's dumb to give work for the sake of work in most cases, especially though for GenEds. You said you spent 10 hours a week? That you had to write an essay every week? Yeah that sucks. I hate classes like that too especially when every class I've taken takes ages to grade anything that can't use a straightforward answer key. \n\nBe that as it is, a lot of people will genuinely struggle to understand certain concepts without being dumb -- so they can excel in their major but struggle in GenEds. I know a lot of people who struggle with science when it gets too abstract and invisible. I know I struggled with writing growing up because there wasn't a right answer, per se. For those people, having something, anything, that they can do to shore up for their weaknesses is a huge blessing. \n\nAnd if your problem is really just that you don't feel intellectually enriched then it sounds like you're just complaining about how you were prepared. Which I guess sucks for you. You already learned biology to the 100 level. And there wasn't anything new for you in your GenEd biology class. Sorry you were bored. \n\nAnd my point with all this is you can learn something from this. Try and evaluate your level against the lowest common denominator. If you know next to nothing or never took a course in the field before, go for the basic GenEd. Or don't! We have so many choices, and like I said, actually the more specialized you get, the less work you have to do in a lot of cases! The class sizes will be smaller, the professor will have fewer TAs, and so they'll assign less work. The reason why these aren't GenEds is because they're not good entry points generally. But you're not entry level.\n\nYou can complain about the highschool system. I didn't take bio in freshman year, I took AP bio as a junior. So for me it's been about 5 years since I took the class. If I were to take bio again now I bet it'd be an exercise in remembering things rather than learning them for the first time. But yeah, most people don't remember most of their highschool classes, especially not ones from freshman year.",

Most people in the major are super egotistical, and look down on anyone that struggles in a class that they deem \"easy\".\n\nLet me give you some advice. I was once in your shoes. I had to fill my Humanities credit, and took an intro to Humanities class. At first, I hated it because it felt like a waste of my time. I was at BYU to learn about computers, so why did I have to sit through two, hour-long lectures every week about film, art, and architecture? I hated the class. But then, I heard a Senior in my program talk about how his favorite class in college was something outside the major. It was like film studies or photography or something. I really looked up to this guy, so hearing this made me curious. I decided to change my attitude and just see what (if anything) I could get out of my stupid Humanities class.\n\nI tried my best to go in with a new perspective and attempt to learn anything at all. I ended up really enjoying the subject once I had given it a chance. I had gone in with the idea that it was going to be a stupid class that I learned nothing from, and that was the case until I changed my perspective. I ended up gaining a lot from the class, and even went back and took the second one with the same professor.\n\nYou now have the ability to learn and grow just like I did. No one can force you to get outside of your shell. But I want you to really reflect on a question. Did you get nothing out of the class because there was genuinely nothing to get out of it, or did you get nothing out of it because you decided, before you even got a chance to find out, that you were not going to get anything out of it? Really think about it, and try to have a better attitude towards education in the future. You are in a spot in life where you have the ability to learn anything your heart desires, but you have to be willing to try new things and look at the positives, or else college will be nothing but a piece of paper in the end.",

PS 100 covers physics, chemistry, geology, and astronomy, but there are always a few students at the beginning of the semester that have taken enough good high school science classes to get a 75% on the challenge exam, which is what is required to skip the class.  I imagine you can probably skip BIO 100 if you got a 4 or 5 on the AP Biology exam, but a lot of high schools have good quality biology courses that aren't AP, so I think it's odd that you can't challenge out of it.  \n\nAnyway, as a professor at BYU (in another field), I apologize.  I think they try to make GE requirements a little  more flexible than \"one size fits all,\" but there are limits. I agree that basic biology is something anyone who graduates from college should be familiar with, but it seems like a challenge exam for a class that usually has a high school counterpart isn't too much to ask.",

When I was an undergrad I took a class that fulfilled a science req and an arts &amp; letters that was a combination of the science behind the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and the seminal science fiction lit of the last 2 centuries. It was taught by a lit professor and an astronomy professor who were both having way too much fun. They have new offerings every semester in the different sections, but the course title is Unexpected Connect or Connection, can\u2019t quite remember, but I do know they\u2019re still offered. \n\nAlso, sorry about the disappointing experience with your instructor. They can really make or break a class.",

We had good discussions about pseudoscience, vaccines (way before Covid was a thing), and had a module all on local wildlife and birds that can be seen and recognized on campus and around Utah. \n\nOn top of that, we covered all of the basics of BIO including cells, DNA, etc etc. \n\nI still remember the birds we learned about to this day and it's been fun to have that random knowledge rattling around in my head with all of the nerdy CyberSec stuff",

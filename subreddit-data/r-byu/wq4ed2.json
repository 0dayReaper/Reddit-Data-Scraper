Does anyone know what the admission process is like for grad programs (outside of the endorsement)? How is the housing situation like?",

            "comment": "For graduate admissions, from my experience (electrical and computer engineering graduate degree) and the other grads in other programs I've talked to, knowing the professors matters a lot. I would start getting in contact with professors you are interested in, look at their research, etc ... Then reach out to them and try to work something out before even applying. If a professor wants you in their lab, as long as you meet the other minimum requirements, you'll get accepted.",

            "comment": "My wife recently did the school psych program at BYU. She was worried her GPA wasn't competitive enough, but what really helped her was fantastic letter of recommendation from a professor she worked with during her undergraduate. \n\nAlso, someone else mentioned that it is important to get to know the professors who do research in school psych. While this definitely won't hurt, this doesn't seem to carry nearly as much weight in school psych as it does in other programs. School Psych has a much larger focus on the class work and in-school experience needed for accreditation than research. That being said, it is still required to lead a research project and write a thesis, so if that's not your cup of tea, it might be a good idea to look into programs that don't require a thesis.\n\nAs far as housing goes, you have two main options. The first is student housing that is relatively close to campus. This housing typically consists of younger college students (with a median age of probably 20), but you can find some complexes that are older (like Millrace).  The student life near campus is usually more lively. Plus campus is usually either within walking distance, or there is a nearby shuttle that will take you to and from campus at least every hour. Rent is usually $400-$500 a month for a private room, but can go higher depending on the complex.\n\nThe second option is housing that is further away from campus. There's a lot of different options here. The cheaper options are basement apartments, old quadplexes, and old apartments, which can be found both in Provo, or in surrounding cities (Orem, Springville, etc...). These usually range from 900-1100 if you want a two bedroom. This might be a viable option if you don't mind dealing with driving to campus (which includes the nightmare that is parking at BYU), and can find someone to room with so you can split rent. If you have the money, there are also some much nicer apartments that are much more modern, but the rent tends to get too high for the typical student. \n\nGood luck with applying to grad school!",

I don\u2019t know if it was just my experience, but it seemed BYU took the longest to inform me I was accepted. I had received acceptance letters from 3 other colleges before BYU. \n\nHousing is pretty bad, as it is over crowded everywhere in Utah county, with Provo and Orem being the absolute worst. You will definitely need to plan/make arrangements in advance to guarantee a good rate.",

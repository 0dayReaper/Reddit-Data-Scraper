Anyone with a green card can enlist, but only citizens can serve as officers.

There were definitely students involved who were not of US birth, but there are certain requirements that need to be met for military service. This is a question to asked to one of the officers in charge of the detachment. If there is any place to send in information on the site, I would direct your questions there. In my experience they are very prompt, but you\u2019ll probably get a response only during business hours.\n\nJust for note, the ROTC detachments here are top notch.",

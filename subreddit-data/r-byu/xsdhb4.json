Can be muddy. \n\nMy favorite one is Meadow Hot Springs. Super pretty. Multiple pools of varying temperatures, but it\u2019s an hour 43mins away. The hottest pool is like 30 feet deep in the middle. Way fun to explore",

If you're willing to drive a bit (1- 2 hrs) there are the usually less crowded Baker Hot springs and my favorite the Meadow Hot Springs. Meadow Hot springs are much deeper and interesting, but maybe not as good for easy lounging. \n\nIf you're willing to pay there is also the Crater in Midway where you can actually scuba dive, snorkel, or just relax but it's not really hot so much as warm.",

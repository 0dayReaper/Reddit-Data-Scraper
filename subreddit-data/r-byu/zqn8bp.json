    "postText": "I'm a temporary faculty staff planning to visit BYU next year. I've been searching for an apartment I could stay at for the first couple of months till I settle down. Could you point me to some resources/websites I could take a look at. \n\nI went through a few websites expecting Airbnb like facilities and couldn't decide on any specific ones either due to the distance or the cost. Because I'm not used to transacting in US dollars, the prices throw me off a bit too. What's the average cost of rent like around BYU for a basic single apartment and do you guys have any suggestions on areas that might have such temporary arrangements that for around a month?",

            "comment": "For a one bedroom apartment, I'd say the average price is probably about $1100. You can definitely find stuff for cheaper (\\~$850), but you have to look hard and it'll be an old basement apartment or further from BYU.\n\nThe best place to look is Facebook Marketplace and [KSL classifieds](https://homes.ksl.com/rent/search). A lot of these require you to sign a year long contract, but you can probably sell your contract when you leave. Good luck!",

Or in summer lack of air conditioning can make it\u2019s miserable to sleep at night. Also public transport if you will not have a car etc. \nand especially if you are visiting BYU and Provo for first time there is a lot of culture shock to process and having a comfortable place to live would help. I would suggest private room with on campus housing or sharing a two bed apt on campus.",

In fact, I'm noticing now that some of the cheaper spaces I shortlisted were basement apartments.\n\nUnfortunately, I've been informed that on-campus housing will not be available. So that's out of the question. Some of the other answers have provided websites that I think will be helpful. \n\nI'm actually visiting the US for the first time too! So I'm certain I'll take quite some time to settle down. I read your answer a couple of times and I've decided to take a friend from BYU along when I go house-hunting. I think I'll miss out on other nuances too if I don't have someone local.",

Why are you visiting BYU? \n\nFor students:\n- As a 18-year-old or first year student: heritage halls, rivera apartments, Helaman halls and language immerison student residence\n- As a 19-year old student (or older): heritage halls, wyview park, rivera apartments, Helaman halls and language immerison student residence.\n- Off campus housing: I heard some really good things about The Colonies and Campus Plaza. Maybe you can try them?\n\nWhat currency do you use? That would help with pricing. What is your budget?",

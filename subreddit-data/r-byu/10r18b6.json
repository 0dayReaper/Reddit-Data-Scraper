But now it\u2019s out of our budget, so we tell them we\u2019re rescinding our application then\n\n- Now they tell us the refund for the fee will be available for us to pick up as a check from their office once it\u2019s processed in 40 days\n\n\nI mean, at least we\u2019re getting the money back but goodness, this city and these companies are a pain to deal with",

            "comment": "Unfortunately, this is not just a Provo problem; this is a consistent issue in most college towns. I started grad school at Penn State a few years ago after graduating from BYU, and I can't believe what some of the landlords try to get away with; there are some places in downtown State College charging $1000/month for a private bedroom in a four-bedroom high-rise. There's a particularly infamous management company here that makes the slimes at Redstone and Continental look like absolute saints; we're talking management so bad that there have been negligent death lawsuits filed against them because they simply don't maintain their properties.\n\nI also grew up in a college town, and while I don't recall hearing the same kinds of stories (I left before it was really a common topic of discussion with my peers), rent is extravagant in the area, particularly close to either of the universities. It's an unfortunate side effect of managers and landlords realizing that most of their clientele will either just take out more student loans or get more roommates to pay the bills.",

Easily could have charged $1500/mo given the location and size of the apartment, but chose not to.\n\nSerious role model. I couldn't believe it when they told me.\n\nMeanwhile just about every other landlord I know in Provo cranks up the rent on their tenants at least $100 every year because \"it's amazing, they just keep paying it\".",

Doing a quick google search of student rentals in Provo will yield nothing but those mega-companies and their scams. Instead, make lots of friends, ask them where they live, find people who live in smaller complexes that are maybe family owned. It seems like the only way to rent at one of those smaller places is to know someone who lives there and have an \u201cin\u201d. \n\nOr, go walk around and find a place that is nice and knock on the doors asking how to get a lease there, etc.. it takes more effort on your part, but renting with those kinds of places are infinitely more enjoyable than redstone type places. \n\nI\u2019ve rented in Provo for over 6 years and have had both kinds of experience. Trust me, it\u2019s worth it to find the \u201chidden gems\u201d",

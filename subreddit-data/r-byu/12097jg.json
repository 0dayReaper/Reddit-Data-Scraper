Professor Spencer knew these historical figures extremely well and it made for super interesting lectures. \n\nThere is a bit of reading (40-60 pages a week) and sometimes it\u2019s hard to grasp. But Professor Spencer is super chill and would give us full points if we attempted to understand the material (honestly it seemed like he wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of grading). \n\nOverall, pretty easy class. Interesting material. I came out with a pretty comprehensive understanding of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud. \n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any other questions!",

It's a fantastic experience, and perhaps one of the only classes I've been in where so many students are eager to contribute dialogue to the discussion.\n\nThe homework is almost entirely reading comprehension, and you *will* need all the listed textbooks to do it. The exams are essentially longer, more free-form versions of the homework, where you discuss a prompt in support of or against the philosopher in question. Sometimes the readings make less sense but Professor Spencer does a good job providing help where needed.\n\nProfessor Spencer himself does well with teaching, and understands the value of a discussion over a rote presentation. If you're engaged in the learning process during class, you may find this to be one of your best class experiences.",

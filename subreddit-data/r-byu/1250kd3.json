    "postText": "It'll be my first time visiting Utah later this week to visit BYU Law School. I was planning on taking the SLC Express from the airport directly to Provo, but the times don't match up with my flight, so now I'm looking to take the train. From what I understand, I must take the TRAX Light Rail Green Line from the airport to North Temple Station in downtown Salt Lake. Then, I would take the FrontRunner Route 750 train to Provo. \n\nDoes anyone know if this is accurate?",

            "comment": "Yes that is accurate. Green line to north temple and then frontrunner to Provo station. If you want to get to campus then you can take the UVX bus that runs from Orem Station to Provo station and passes by BYU\u2019s campus.",

            "comment": "Yep, I can confirm since I do that trip once every few months. Check the timing because the green line from the airport runs every 20 minutes but most days in the afternoon the frontrunner only runs every hour (depending on the time of day, but just double check the schedule). It\u2019s pretty straightforward, but just be aware you could be waiting close to an hour if you get unlucky with the trax/frontrunner timing",

You can probably take UVX from the Provo station to get to wherever you're going, too. \n\nLike others said, check the schedules so you know what to expect. I used to ride FrontRunner every day, and it sucks missing the train and then discovering the next one doesn't come for an hour. Of course, the nature of this kind of travel is that you do just have to wait sometimes, but it's good to minimize it if you can :)",

    "postText": "I want to take it bc it is one of my required classes for graduation. Has anyone done it? How hard was it? Would it be better to take in a semester? Also I meant to say CALCULUS 2 not 1.\n\nThanks!\n\nPs. I am not that good at math and I get very nervous when I have to go to the Testing Center. So I prefer to avoid taking tests there if possible.",

They either get behind, or try and rush through it and just don\u2019t learn anything.\n\nPlus, there are a ton of resources available to you to do well in 113, like your TA, the Mathlab and like 200 other BYU students all learning calculus together.",

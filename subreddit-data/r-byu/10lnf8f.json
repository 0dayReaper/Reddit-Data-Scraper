    "postText": "Im taking chem 105 as a filler class because i needed more credits for my fafsa financial aid (long story). However with 15 credits i feel like im dying. Should i withdraw and then have to pay back like $3800 from my fasfa and scholarships (i got a refund because excess) or should i fail the class to keep the $800 (i literally cannot deal with it anymore and i already fulfilled the GE requirements \nAlso i couldnt get 4 hours of 2nd term credits\n\nId also most likely go on academic probation since im on a warning rn, unless i did well enough in the other classes to have a 2.0 or higher (its possible if i get Bs) but idk, all i know is i CANT do this class, i need out",

Why? \n\nIf you needed more credits I highly recommend taking SWELL classes, like bowling, indoor cycling, martial arts, etc. It\u2019s a good way to take a break from school and have fun.\n\nChemistry 105 is one of the weeder class for engineering. That\u2019s saying something about this class. I took this class my freshman year and I died doing it. \n\nNext time, talk to an academic advisor and do your research over a course before taking it as a filler course.\n\nGood luck OP.",

They'll help you come up with a plan.\n\nUntil then, I recommend living in the TA lab for chem 105. I recommend going to their test reviews. Everything. If you don't understand something? Get a TA. Chemistry is hard so do not procrastinate on anything.\n\nAlso, pro tip: I failed every single test in chem 105, I still got a B- because I got the homework done. It's possible to not know what you are doing and still get a good grade in the class. So don't get to hard on yourself if you fail at something. You got this.",

You need 12 credits to be a full-time student, and you wouldn't get more money by taking over 12 credits because the tuition would be the same; thus, Pell Grant would be the same amount. The same with the scholarship; you only need 12 credits to keep the scholarship. You should talk with Enrollment Services (801-422-4104) and double-check if you need to pay anything back if you withdrew from CHEM 105 and had 12 credits.",

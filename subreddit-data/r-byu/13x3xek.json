Not nearly as spread out as I've seen others but I wouldn't make a [ratemyprofessor.com](https://ratemyprofessor.com) score the primary variable in establishing my schedule. \n\nThere's a lot of things you have to take in to account. For example, do you plan on getting a job or not? What are your study habits like? Can you study between classes effectively or do you do better with long uninterrupted blocks? Are you living in the dorms or in an apartment off campus? \n\nI'd take a lower rated (slightly lower. I'm not talking about a terribly rated) professor over having my day broken out too much. Being on campus all day long is tough and if you do plan on working, having your classes blocked together more is going to make it much easier to find a competitive job. \n\nI was an older freshman who lived south of campus and worked. So for me, I valued flexibility in my schedule. \n\nBut all that being said, there's nothing that screams out major problems with what you've put together. Best of luck!",

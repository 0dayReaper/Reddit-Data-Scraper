That being said, they don't give a lot of opportunities to non-majors because the acting/mdt majors need the credits. \n\nEach semester the advanced directing classes produce one-act plays that are more inclusive of other majors. There is also a student directed full production most semesters. \n\nYou can also just get involved in the community, local theatres include Lehi, Scerra, Hale, Springville, and Draper. \n\nYou'll hear about most auditions from posters in the West Campus Building, but they also have a newsletter. Get in touch with the theatre office to get added to their list.",

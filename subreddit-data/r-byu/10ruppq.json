I\u2019ve been able to sell mine in the past starting in March, but typically had to drop $100 off rent per month for someone. It\u2019s definitely a buyers market by about end of March once people know their summer plans.",

Carriage Cove is up there, selling my contract there was a piece of cake (as opposed to the branbury where I had to pay someone to take it). Or if you luck out into a house south of provo, selling will be easy",

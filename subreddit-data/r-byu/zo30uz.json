    "postText": "Hey all, I'm actually not a BYU student but ended up picking up a copy of the Foundations In Applied Mathematics series that you guys use for your ACME program. \n\nI really really enjoy the book, to the point that I'm looking for more info on the Modeling With Uncertainty &amp; Data + Modeling With Dynamics &amp; Control course materials. \n\nFrom what I can tell, these topics would be covered in Vol 3 and Vol 4 of the series, but those books haven't been published yet. In the meantime, do you guys just use a standardized set of lecture notes then? \n\nIf so, would anyone be willing to share them? Also, anyone know when they're planning to publish the other 2 volumes?",

I\u2019m fairly positive I\u2019d get in trouble if I shared them, but if you are very enthusiastic about reading them I\u2019d recommend asking Jared Whitehead about Vol 4 and Emily Evans or Tyler Jarvis (all BYU professors) about Vol 3. They might be able to share a copy with you.\n\nVol 3 seems fairly close to being published. Maybe a year or two from now? Vol 4 is a ways away from being published.",

    "postText": "Hi, I almost couldn't have had worse luck while trying to record the major tearings from the HFAC today! I set my computer screen recorder to the HBLL view before coming down, and then I had my camera on tripod with the battery saying it had 47 minutes left. And then this big collapse/sag happened and it was somewhat spectacular compared to any previous tearings that I had seen of that building!\n\nBut then I discovered that my stupid battery was already dead anyway! UGHHH!\n\nAnd then I get home hoping that my computer caught it, but my stupid capture box pulled one of its stupid random stop stunts only a bit later than an hour and a half from when I started it (so it only got to about 10:15 even though I had PLENTY  of disk space! DOUBLE UGHHH!\n\nI'll ask the ass't dean, who I'm told is the guy who set these up, if his system also records real time while he builds a time-lapse version of it, and if so, then if he would please give me a copy. But meanwhile, as I wait for his reply, who of you in here were standing over there while that stuff came crashing down?\n\nThanks, if so, and happy demolition-watching!Goodbye, HFAC. Nearly 6 decades old, yet we hardly knew ye! (Well... some of us, unfortunately.... \"Wait... what? TEN pipe organs? Ya gotta be kidding me!\")",

It drives me insane!\r  \n\r  \nAs of just NOW I have ordered 4 new batteries for this camera and they should be here in just a few days, in time for the next few or several collapses! Meanwhile, the old faulty (but still mostly good) batteries are being recharged, so I should be good in the interim, but I'll just assume that once they get down to about an hour left, it's time to swap for the next one because now that's their new \"zero.\"",

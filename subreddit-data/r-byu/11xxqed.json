From my understanding he was involved in removing trans voice therapy and other trans resources from BYU. \n\nI personally know people who could have benefited from it and felt the removal of it was sending a message to queer students at BYU. \n\nIt was definitely disheartening and a lot of us are scared it could lead to the removal of other queer resources or protections especially now that he\u2019ll be the president of BYU. \n\nHope this helps!",

BYU has a historical record of following the world on LGBTQ issues. Whenever there's a conservative backlash, BYU tends to follow. And right now there's a conservative backlash against transgender people. As a transgender person at BYU I am wary of him but am hoping things will turn out okay. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.",

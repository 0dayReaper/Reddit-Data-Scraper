But your MCAT, GMAT, or LSAT scores are also very heavily considered.  Law schools and medical school are first going to look at LSAT and MCAT scores before they look at what school you went to and what your GPA is.   \n\nYes, BYU is more rigorous and you might end up with a lower GPA than at BYUI, but you might be better prepared for those other exams. \n\nI graduated from BYUI in 2006, no post-graduate education.  I'm a working professional and really good at what I do.  No one cares where I went to school.\n\nYour degree gets your foot in the door at your first job.",

Despite clearly indicating on my resume which school I went to and after correcting my boss dozens of times after two years he still thought that I went to BYU in Provo. Most don't know the distinction and think that they are the same school.\n\nMost companies are going to teach you 99% of what you need to know via OTJ (on the job) training so the actual school is not going to matter much. I've been seeing discussions saying as much on LinkedIn recently.\n\nAs far getting an MBA in my case my employer paid for it and the school didn't even want my transcript or GMAT score once they knew who I worked for and that they were getting paid upfront.\n\nWith all that being said if you are going into a highly specialized field than the prestige of the school very well may matter. Law may fall into that category, but I don't know.",

If you want a better education and experience, go to BYU and put in the effort to get a good GPA.

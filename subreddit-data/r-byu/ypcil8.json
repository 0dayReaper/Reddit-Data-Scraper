For some they find that person easily and it appears to be \u201cstorybook perfect\u201d, others long and question why nothing is happening regardless of their efforts; but I don\u2019t see a lot of people asking people on dates to get to know someone. It\u2019s either all or nothing. Or a few and then ghost. And I\u2019ve had my share of disappointments and quick lived successes, but there isn\u2019t this great cultural energy around the culture of making friends to dating people. \n\nWhy do you think dating culture is so weird? Why aren\u2019t guys asking gals on dates? Or should gals ask more guys out and how? Is it the pressure of school and work that keep people focused on staying alive and just staying in their friend groups?\n\nDoes age, mission status, and majors play into who you decide to date? Are there turnoffs for you based on those?\n\nDo you feel people are looking for a \u201cspark\u201d or a hint to their \u201csoulmate?\u201d \nWhat do you want a gal/guy to do to help kickstart that excitement of dating people and spending quality time one-on-one? To help create that good culture of dating many people and not getting too serious too fast? Is it Asking you in person? Eating lunch with you? Getting to know you? Etc.?\n\nAre people afraid of the drama or just want to create it? Is the dating culture a roll over from covid lockdowns?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on just one of these questions? I\u2019m genuinely curious and want to learn how I can be better. \n\nFreshman to grad students, and recently married couples, and us single Pringle\u2019s, pitch in!",

            "comment": "The problem is the environment is super charged and it ends up more like a speed\ndating circus. 1. You have returned missionaries feeling pressured by their exit interview where they are told to find their next companion as soon as they can. 2. Especially for women this creates a lot of tension because they feel every interaction with a man is about marriage rather than about dating. 3. For the men, not all, if things don\u2019t click right away they move on to the next because that\u2019s how they\u2019ll find the one. \n\nSo you don\u2019t have people taking the time to get to know each other but instead they\u2019re moving on if they meet resistance because they perhaps figure there are plenty of fish in the sea. It makes things weird as people don\u2019t really get to know each other but instead are just going on a series of practically blind dates rather than getting to know the other person. \n\nSo here is the advice i got back in the day. \n\nFind a hungry samurai \n\nWhat does that mean? \n\nIn the Akira Kurasawa film 7 samurai there is a village of peasants who are being harried by bandits. They don\u2019t have gold to hire Samurai to defend them but they do have rice. Ultimately they are able to find Samurai who want rice and not gold and they hire their defenders. \n\nYou are like the villagers. You have something to offer but you haven\u2019t found a Samurai who wants what you have to offer. \n\nHere is the thing. There are lots of people offering gold out there and you can\u2019t compete with your rice. (No value judgement here Gold does not equal looks or money or whatever) You won\u2019t attract people looking for something you don\u2019t have to offer. So find people looking for what you do have to offer. \n\nFor me I realized I was trying date any girl who talked to me but what I really needed to do was find a girl who was geeky like me and wanted what I had to offer. When I reset my priorities I realized I had known the perfect person for two years at that point and had never asked her out. When I did we hit it off right away and because of our friendship we already knew so much about each other. \n\nNow that\u2019s just what worked for me but if you focus on what you have to offer rather than just what you want your prospects are bound to improve. \n\nDon\u2019t stress though. Building a strong relationship takes time and maturity something that is hard to make happen in a few short years at BYU. Don\u2019t rush into something you will regret because you are convinced you need to be married by a certain age or date. That\u2019s what leads to unhappy marriages that stay together for the wrong reasons. You\u2019re looking for not just a short term thing. \n\nFinal piece of advice. Be happy being yourself. Be willing to accept that you are wonderful as you are and do not need to define yourself by a relationship. Sure it would be nice but you are awesome on your own to. Find that peace and know yourself. \n\nYou are right dating in Utah Valley is rough but you cam survive and even if you leave that doesn\u2019t mean the door is closed there\u2019s a world of people out there and opportunities yet to be explored.",

            "comment": "22m here and I totally agree, dating culture here is weird, especially if you compare it to most other schools which have more of a party/hookup culture. Here it's closer to the \"asking people on dates to get to know someone\" thing but not quite there.\n\nI've seen that lots of people take it _too_ seriously and only become friends with the intention of dating, not just to become friends at all, and then pass up on becoming friends with perfectly good people in hopes they can find and date someone more attractive in some way. That has been my own experience as well as that of many of my friends.\n\n&gt; Why aren\u2019t guys asking gals on dates?\n\nThey're scared, and usually for good reason. They've been shot down too many times, or lost a friend because she figured he was only in it to try to date her and she wasn't interested in that so she cut him off completely. After rejection after rejection it's hard to find motivation to keep trying to date, so you just stick to making friends with gals and never ask them out in fear of ruining the friendship.\n\nIt's easier to ask someone out the first time I meet them after a short conversation, especially if she isn't in my usual friend group. Best case we become friends, and she knows where I want to take it which gives her a chance to be upfront about what she wants, worst case she says no and I don't have to see her again. That still takes guts and it still hurts when you get rejected, but isn't nearly as painful as losing someone you spent a lot of time and effort building a genuine friendship with, catching feelings for them, and finally building up enough courage to ask them out.\n\n&gt; Or should gals ask more guys out and how?\n\nAbsolutely, it would take a lot of the pressure off if gals asked us out more. Guys rarely get asked out (in fact 90% of guys guys rarely even get compliments) so if you were to ask out a guy you have a pretty good chance of getting a yes. If there's a particular guy you're interested in, don't wait around for him to ask you out, there's a good chance it'll never happen because he doesn't want to ruin the friendship y'all have by making it awkward. And don't think your hints are gonna help, guys are oblivious/trying to be careful so unless you make it extremely obvious it'll go right over his head.\n\n&gt; Is it the pressure of school and work that keep people focused on staying alive and just staying in their friend groups?\n\nFor lots of people, yes. Outside of work and school, lots of us simply don't have time to meet others outside our small circles. Some get lucky and find their person in one of their classes or their ward...others just don't.\n\n&gt; Does age, mission status, and majors play into who you decide to date? Are there turnoffs for you based on those?\n\nAge does. I'm 22, if she's a freshman straight out of high school that's a pretty big turn off. I'm sure there are some very mature freshmen out there (and I have friends who married freshmen and things worked out and they're happy together) and I apologize if I'm generalizing too much here, but I know too many freshmen who think it's fun to play games and mess with feelings and I'm not looking to play those games. I also have younger friends who are great people and want to do things right and not hurt people, but they tend to be the kind of people who really want to serve a mission and it feels wrong to get in the way of that. RM status doesn't make a huge difference to me (other than RM freshman don't trigger that red flag). I can't be picky about majors but if she doesn't care about education/has a crappy work ethic that is also concerning.\n\nTake this with a grain of salt as I've never been in a relationship and not sure if I'm being too picky.\n\n&gt; Do you feel people are looking for a \u201cspark\u201d or a hint to their \u201csoulmate?\u201d What do you want a gal/guy to do to help kickstart that excitement of dating people and spending quality time one-on-one? To help create that good culture of dating many people and not getting too serious too fast?\n\nI don't think there has to be a super strong spark but at least the desire to get to know each other as friends first. If we're on a date and I get the vibe that you're bored and would rather be doing something else, I become less interested too because I don't want to waste your time. \n\n&gt; Is it Asking you in person? Eating lunch with you? Getting to know you? Etc.?\n\nI feel like asking in person is the way to go because you can at least get to know them just a little bit and that'll change your perception of them. I've gone on dates with women who I probably would have swiped down on if I saw them on mutual but I met them and had a conversation and realized they were really cool. Some of them I'm still friends with even though being more than friends didn't work out. I'm sure the opposite is true too, and some of the women I've gone out with would have definitely swiped down on me. Lunch is a nice first date because it's low key, you can spend that time getting to know each other (as opposed to a movie or something where you aren't talking) and it's not so outrageous/expensive that the other person feels obligated to go on a 2nd date even if they don't want to.\n\nAgain, it hasn't worked out for me yet so I'm not sure how much of this applies to anyone else.",

I have picked up exactly 2.5 times in my life when a girl was dropping hints and was interested in me, and 2 of those times I did pick it up were by girls who were so blatant about it that they may as well have been holding up signs saying, \"Please date me.\" (The 0.5 comes from a girl who was kind of awkward and may not have meant what she said to come out the way that it sounded.)\n\nWe don't pick up on it. And if we do, we still usually won't do anything because we hate being wrong more than we like being right.",

Dating woes plague people all over the place, but Provo has its additional quirks.\n\nYou sort of alluded to the thing that I see. We often grew up hearing stories of \"I knew they were the one on the first date\", \"my roommate got engaged on their second date\". We grew up hearing fairytales, and I've noticed that a number of people (not all) expect it to be that fairytale and nothing else, which means those people are often not willing to put work into building a relationship or even put effort into dating. People often get their feelings played with and led on then suddenly cut off.\n\nAnd there is still sadly an unhealthy pressure to get married. You should feel it is ONE of your next steps in life, but you shouldn't feel pressured into it. This pressure often discourages people when they don't get the fairytale.\n\nAll this means there are many very good people here who simply no longer have the mental energy to deal with the dating world. Many good guys who are tired of having no energy and effort returned and many good gals who are tired of first date after first date.",

            "comment": "22m RM 4th year here\n\nA problem I have is that I don't feel attracted easily. I'm very picky, and at this point I sick of dating for fun. Dating has honestly never felt fun, its felt stressful even as a teenager. At this point, I know what I want, so the idea of dating for fun has lost appeal to me because when I see people do that, its because they don't know what they like. I do. \n\nMission status does play a part in who I am willing to ask out tho. Like my freshman year before my mission I didn't date at all. I made the decision I was gonna serve and didn't want a chance of getting dear john'd. Now, when a girl tells me she is planning on being a missionary, its not a \"red flag\", I call it a \"red line\". \n\nThere is this one girl in my asl class. She's cool, drop-dead gorgeous, funny, checks off a lot of my boxes, but she's gonna be a missionary. I knew several guys and girls in my mission that were certainly distracted, and all had the same thing in common of writing home and just trying to make it to P-day so they could email their SO. I don't want any missionary living their service like that. You get *this* much time to be a missionary, \"don't count the days make them count\" is my motto.\n\n\"why don't guys ask girls out?\"\n\nIts because we have enough problems as it is, we don't need the words \"you're a great guy but...\" going through our heads along with everthing else",

What I mean by deterministic is that you can control the outcome. Maybe not on a day by day basis, but even short term we have much more control over our dating lives than we let ourselves think.\n\nAnyway I gotta sleep, maybe I\u2019ll flesh out my response tomorrow.",

As if a lot of women see their purpose within the context of their connection to men. (could be completely wrong tho once again)\n\nAnd I feel like with men its almost seen as a necessary quest to fulfill prior to death which is an odd way to view love.\n\nFinally I can only imagine what it must be like for individuals who fall out of the cis het box.",

I was so shocked at the number of girls who I thought I was friends with but just vanished as soon as either they or I were \u2018off the market\u2019.\n\nEven people I had classes with and sat next to. One girl showed up with a ring and I said \u2018oh congratulations! When did you get engaged?\u2019 And that was just about the last conversation we had despite being friendly, if not friends, and sitting next to each other in several classes.\n\nIt was weird. A friend gets engaged and they disappeared. I start dating someone and a bunch friends that are girls pretty much vanish overnight.\n\nOne last experience. I was dating someone and went to a small dinner party. My girlfriend couldn\u2019t be there. No big deal. I start talking to someone I didn\u2019t know. She\u2019s married. Her husband is out of town for a while for work stuff. She knew most of the people there, but NOBODY else was talking to her because they were all single. The single women were only talking to the single guys. The single guys were only talking to the single girls. Completely oblivious to the fact that there was a person there (a friend to a bunch of them) who sat by themselves for most of the evening.  Who probably felt extra lonely because her husband was gone.\n\nIt\u2019s truly ferocious out there.",

Stopped hanging out with his old friends because he was trying to better, \u201cget to know\u201d her and before long he had dropped completely off the radar. Five or six years later when he started to try and reach out to people he had to rebuild everything from scratch because they had moved on. \n\nThis is one side. The other is when the newlyweds refuse to hangout with single folks unless they cam try and hook the single folks up with one of their friends. This is awkward too. \n\nPerhaps all of this is associated with transitioning into married wards from singles wards and it creates a weird dynamic. Whatever it is it doesn\u2019t feel healthy. Especially because in the first case many controlling spouses force the other spouse away from their friends and eventually isolate them making them dependent on the controller. Even to the point of abuse. Not\nHealthy at all.",

We were getting our home set up, finance in order, figure out couple schedules (now two people needing to use the car), etc. A few years later kids come in the picture and it's a completely different story.  \n\n\nI just don't think the \"married people become less available\" occurrence is necessarily unhealthy or a sign of abuse in the great majority of the cases.",

A lot of good points in this thread but I think a big problem is people don\u2019t know how to turn themselves into a catch. \n\nStop and think for a second. Would someone really enjoy spending eternity with you? Do you have interesting hobbies? Are you a good conversationalist? Do you care about your appearance to a reasonable extent? Are you active? Do you know how the opposite gender thinks and how to treat them? Are you interesting? Do you have goals? Do you have any emotional baggage you haven\u2019t dealt with? Do you have a good work/life balance? Are you clean and hygienic? \n\nI certainly can\u2019t say I\u2019m meeting all of those expectations. Few people are. But we should still try. Being hot is not enough if you want to have a happy relationship. I can\u2019t tell you how many attractive girls I have taken out just for them to have nothing else going for them.\n\nThere\u2019s this weird self acceptance culture that preaches we are perfect just the way we are when in reality we are often stagnant and not reaching out potential. You can\u2019t change everything about yourself but you can become the best version of yourself. \n\nBottom line is there are a million fish in the sea, if you aren\u2019t putting in effort to stand out you won\u2019t.",

Everyone is expected to be the best at all times, while not looking desperate. The church encourages this behavior unfortunately, if unintentionally. My advice is to set your standards high and not just settle for someone who 'checks all the boxes' (RM, boy scout, etc.) Rather, focus on the individual behind the accomplishments. I've known Peter priesthoods who are liars and abusers, but keep up appearances. Follow your gut, and be yourself",

At the time I felt it was worth it, because it was 2 hours each time, 2x a week, so 16hrs a month getting paid to sit on my phone.\n\nLuckily I never had any medical issues as a result, some people pass out or get arm pain, I never did. It also motivated me to watch my diet a little better and drink more water in order to have optimum flow. The money ended up being nice, I think in the 1.5 years I donated with my SO (who wasn't quite as regular) we cleared about $7k-9k overall.\n\nAs a college student, if you can find the time, it can really help out with your finances.",

Definitely get the details of what the study consists of when you talk to them, and look it up on your own to see if you're comfortable with it. Some are pretty hard-core, but all that I've done have been mellow and have had a history of successful trials without issues. \n\nIt's pretty sick though, you're just locked in their facility up in SLC for the duration and I would just sleep, watch Netflix, and do homework. Great gig if you're okay with a bit of risk. \n\nAlso shameless plug, if you or anyone ends up wanting to do it, dm me and throw me in as a referral for that sweet, sweet referral cash.",

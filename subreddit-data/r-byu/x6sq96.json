The remodels this year made the units a lot nicer.\n\nI believe both are managed by redstone now so don\u2019t expect a good management experience with either.",

Nice, albeit crowded floor plans, a nice clubhouse, hottub, swimming pool, and everyone's pretty social. I also liked living right next to the Provo River Trail, and the UVX bus stop is only about a 5 minute walk away, plus it has a Ryde bus stop to campus right on Freedom Blvd.   \n\n\nSince I moved out though, everyone I've talked to who lives there hates the new management though. Redstone has mistreated the residents quite a bit, and you can read more in Raintree's recent Google Reviews.",

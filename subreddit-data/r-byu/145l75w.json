    "postText": " Hello r/BYU\n\nMy name is Tanner Bennett, I\u2019m a 24 year old student and I\u2019m running for Provo City Council!\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m extremely excited for this opportunity to participate in the democratic process, and wanted to tell you a bit about myself, my campaign, and why I\u2019m running.\u00a0\n\nLink to socials: [https://linktr.ee/bfp2023](https://linktr.ee/bfp2023)\n\n# About me:\n\nI\u2019m a full-time student at BYU studying political science and Mandarin. I\u2019ve spent my whole time at BYU studying about politics and the political process and felt compelled to try and participate when the opportunity presented itself.\u00a0\n\nI am a global sales executive at a company in pleasant grove and have an extensive work history/background in building, working for, and running nonprofits.\u00a0\n\n# Why I\u2019m running:\u00a0\n\nProvo is Utah\u2019s 4th largest municipality with about 115,000 residents, 40% of which are age 18-25 with most attending BYU, UVU or one of the other colleges/technical schools located nearby. This 40% of Provo\u2019s population has been repeatedly shafted by our City Council and major concerns of this population are completely ignored. Why is that? Frankly, **students don\u2019t vote**. When I asked incumbents why they don\u2019t campaign to or talk with college students it\u2019s because we are not engaged. This is for several reasons that range from how busy we are in this stage of life, to complete apathy for government and I completely understand it.\n\n**However, I want to change that but I need your help.**\n\nI\u2019m running as a moderate independent, trying to be a voice for Provo\u2019s silent 40% on both sides of the aisle. This means that I care about:\n\n1. Living within a budget (but also setting a budget that realistically can achieve what provo actually needs)\n2. Acting as a voice for renters against abusive/manipulative landlords and providing concrete reporting methods and fines against landlords that refuse to resolve major issues for their tenants.\u00a0\n3. Promoting active transportation and increasing Provo\u2019s walk/bike/scooter friendliness.\n4. Increase the level of shuttling and public transport offered for areas further from the universities\n5. Continuing to fund, maintain, and improve Provo's trails, biking paths, and conservation/sustainability efforts! (Also improving our leash laws and improving their control/implementation-- nearly been bitten a bit too much!).\n6. Improving the parking situation all over Provo while focusing on increasing our greenspaces.\n7. Working to further improve the level of inclusivity for members of the LGBTQ+ community in Provo.\n8. Focusing in on developing sustainable housing solutions for Provo\u2019s growing unhoused population.\n9. Attracting more businesses to Provo and helping our current businesses to continue to grow and develop.\n10. With more to come!\n\nPeople seem to hate that I'm running on a \"moderate independent\" platform, but at the same time hyperpartisanship is preventing us from achieving solutions that work, are cost-effective, and are based in science and research. According to Gallup research, 37% of Americans identify as moderate, more than conservatives (36%) and more than liberal (27%). I'm hoping to bring both sides closer to the middle and actually work to get things done.\n\n# My campaign:\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m running a **$0 campaign** which means I am not seeking donations and I\u2019m not spending any money beyond what was required to register. This means I\u2019m not spending money on:\u00a0\n\n* signage\n* hand bills\n* advertisements\n* campaign managers\n* etc.\n\nWhat I *am* doing is trying to use social media to educate, promote, and share about the importance of civic engagement and trying to get the 40% people who for sure live in Provo 3/4ths of the year to register here and vote for someone who actually cares about them and their needs. I know what it\u2019s like being a college-age student in Provo because I am one! In office, I hope that I can keep this platform up to share updates and news in a way similar to how Rep. Jeff Jackson has been doing, I think this kind of campaigning and communication is the future.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this long and this sounds like something you would support, I ask that you please take the time to like (or upvote), follow my social media accounts and help share my message! Together we can keep money out of politics and do a lot of good for Provo!\u00a0 \n\nEven if I\u2019m not the person for you, I sincerely hope you\u2019ll register and take the time to find someone who you do want to vote for! In municipal elections, your vote matters more than in any other.\n\nI appreciate you taking the time to read this and hope that if you have questions you will reach out! Thanks again!\n\nLink to socials again: [https://linktr.ee/bfp2023](https://linktr.ee/bfp2023)\u00a0",

            "comment": "I think a big reason you don't see more student participation in local politics at BYU (or other university towns) is that students have limited \"skin in the game\" when it comes to local political decisions. Students generally don't own property, pay local taxes, have kids in local school districts, and are there for a few years. Also, many students are only registered to vote at their permanent address (typically wherever their parents live). While I think these reasons will make it difficult for you to get support beyond the handful of students who might be civically engaged enough in local politics to vote for you, I wish you the best of luck.",

What I am doing I hope will attract enough attention and garner enough support that I can win not only students but permanant residents as well! These things don't just serve students, they serve all of Provo! As for registration, it's super tricky. Most people from out of state don't want to get a Utah license (totally reasonable) and don't see the point in registering in Provo when they will be gone after 4 years. However, I would like to believe that enough people will see the benefits for themselves and maybe younger siblings, friends, etc. and do something to make a difference! Thanks for your comment!",

Effectively preying on students. Is he still on the council? Is he an incumbent? Are his policies still there? (Maybe ask some local towing companies, or ask around?)\n\nI think a lot of students would be motivated to vote if they see how they have actually been taken advantage of not just how things could be more student friendly.",

The city council is responsible for appropriating funds for improving transportation infrastructure on city roads. Want it to be easier to walk to BYU from your apartment? (better crossings on 500 and 800 N, better sidewalks, etc.). Want better renter protections from predatory landlords? That\u2019s the city council. More restaurants, grocery stores and entertainment options closer to where students live? City council. Paid parking in Joaquin and other neighborhoods? Also the city council that would make that decision.\n\nStudents and young people in Provo deserve a voice that will advocate for their interests.",

This is much more a question of allocation of funds than it is of raising our tax burden. Last year Provo city's budget was 374 million dollars and it wound up spending just about 390 million dollars. I'm advocating for pursuing the various items while not asking more from our citizens. The state of Utah recently passed SB 185 which allocates funds to contribute to active transportation projects so I would rather pull from this money than from your property taxes. As for public transportation, there are things going through with UDOT that should generally improve things while keeping taxes where they are. We have to be reasonable and live within a budget, take care of what we need, and then explore what could be possible with what is left! I hope that answers your question! If you would like a breakdown of how your taxes have been used historically, you can find the budget [Here](https://www.provo.org/home/showpublisheddocument/20680/637956540216500000).

I think establishing a basic living standard that if violated can be pursued at the city level. Meaning that if a landlord is not taking care of something like water, mold, smoke, structural stuff, etc. the city will assess fines on the landlord daily until the land lord provides proof that the issue has been resolved. People too often are seeing provo as a \"get it and forget it\" investment when being a landlord needs to be much more. That's also nothing to say of the larger property management companies that we all hate so much. Landlords also are overrenting a lot of their spaces and I think instituting and policing measures that prevent land lords from leaving too little sqft per person in apartments or not providing enough guaranteed parking needs to be addressed. Aside from those I'm still working on additional ideas to help make rent more affordable. Ideas are welcome!",

Unfortunately in Provo the rental market is an issue of scarcity, meaning we need to help relax the scarcity either by partnering with neighboring cities and expanding UVX and other public transit options that are affordable for students, or by opening up zoning in our own city. Rental controls would be a really crazy thing to go after, but I'm not against it if it becomes necessary. It is definitely something I will be addressing if elected.",

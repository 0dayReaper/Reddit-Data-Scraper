    "postText": "Currently rocking a MacBook, but I\u2019m on the fence if I want to swap to a PC solely for the finance core. I currently have a windows desktop and am already very familiar with excel and the shortcuts that are native to windows, but I\u2019m worried about how excel-intensive the program will be especially during classes. \n\nIs this something where I can cruise by with a MacBook and just use my desktop outside of class(at my apartment) when needed, or would you highly recommend just eating the cost of another cheaper windows laptop so it can be used in the library and other places where a portable pc is needed?",

I know that some programs needed for some classes required a PC. However, most of the times those with MacBooks just partnered with someone with a PC (You usually work in groups quite a bit).\n\nIt\u2019s nice to follow along in class with excel, but you should be fine with a Mac for all of that. I think you\u2019d be fine to use your desktop out of class and have the Macbook for in class.",

The rest of the core really isn't that excel heavy, FIN 401 there are a couple of cases that you work in financial statements (which you can do from your desktop), Fin 453 and 411 aren't excel based at all.\n\nTLDR I wouldn't worry about it, I survived with a mac just fine, and have had weeks of training in my corporate job on their laptops to get used to windows shortcuts.",

    "postText": "BYU! Serious question that I am asking in regard to the placekicker. Usually, when a player messes up in a big game they are benched. I'll admit it was a touching moment when Jaren Hall gave Oldroyd a hug, but shouldn't BYU be looking for a new kicker? I understand that he has had a history of success with the program, but he didn't come through in the most important situation. Being new to BYU, I want the Cougs to win a national championship. Having experienced SEC football as a native, it seems  this kicker wouldn't get a second chance (third actually) in the SEC. In fact, Nick Saban pulled Jalen Hurts out of the National Championship game at HALF-TIME a week after he won offensive MVP of the semi-championship. I get it. It's a nice story, but if you want to win then don't you need to make hard decisions? This isn't the YMCA. There is ACTUAL money and prestige on the line. If Oldroyd misses another game winner, that isn't on Him. It's on the Coach.\n\nIn the words George W. \"There's an old saying in Tennessee -- I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again.\" Place kicker position needs to be up for grabs. If Saban benched a future NFL QB mid-game, then BYU's coach should have the courage to bench a placekicker on a Tuesday.\n\nIf I'm wrong and there are no other alternatives, then let me know. Maybe the kicker does deserve a third chance?",

That's one of my favorite presidential quotes ever. I used to have a pretty good imitation of Will Ferrell's W imitation and would drop that all the time.",

This has been the first season in a long time where we BYU fans are actually excited for a potentially consistent (not hail Mary) winning season after the WAY above average start we have had.\n\nIt is a good start to the season, but there is a lot of football to be played still.",

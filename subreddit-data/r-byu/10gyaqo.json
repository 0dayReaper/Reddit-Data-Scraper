Not all of them got interviews even though they were all good applicants. It seemed like the ones who did had a connection with some of the professors in the program",

As someone who applied to 4 MFT programs, got into 2 ( 1 no interview), 1st round interviews for 1(which I was rejected) and 1 interview is tomorrow I can give you some insight on mine. \n\nThe first way to stand out is reach out to the perspective school\u2019s program director or faculty (fill out an inquiry form, someone will reach out) I also attended open houses, meet and greet etc. This way the program will be looking out for you app. When you do this please have a set of meaningful questions to ask. This step is tedious, but also is necessary because you don\u2019t want to ask them questions that you can find on the website. When you meet with them via zoom make into a conversation rather than a Q&amp;A. Tell them things about the program that you thought was interesting. \n\nYour LOR needs to be from professionals who can speak about you academically and professionally. \n\nExperience is a plus. I\u2019m currently working a research assistant for a National study so I was able to speak about it in my personal statement. I also have ABA experience as well as my research topic in undergrad. \n\nYour resume doesn\u2019t have to be long. My resume was very simple. \n\nI believe reaching out to the program really really helped me. Good luck. I hope this is some great advice.",

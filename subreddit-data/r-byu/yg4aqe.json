They give you decent instructions but it takes doing and redoing sewing projects to get them good enough to get a good grade. If you don't have a sewing machine you'll be spending a lot of time in the lab outside of class as well.",

I took 376 from Busby and I really enjoyed his teaching style 95% of the time. Have to write a paper and take 2 tests, but the class is amazing and he takes students questions anonymously and answers them. I took prep for marriage from chelom leaving, it was alright. She pushed mindfulness a lot since that\u2019s what her research is on, she\u2019s nice and the class is easy, I just would have taken it from someone different",

And even here in the USA, they are making great strides in the south and east coast, where it was a lot harder in the past to find a church to attend. Even BYU sports have a lot more Black players and have always catered to Polynesian players!  The leadership has been predominantly white, but that is changing as well. The way things are organized, it may be a while before we see a person of color as the prophet, but there are a TON that are General Authorities. \n\nBut the church doesn\u2019t make selections for their colleges like the rest of the world does. They don\u2019t look at the \u201cwoke\u201d principles they profess or how the candidate can best bridge the divide between those who want to be in a religious university because of their beliefs, and those who want to see the beliefs change to fit their own sinful, anti-Christian beliefs while they attend the college in protest. \n\nThe church relies on personal and church revelation to its leaders. And you can bet they got some input from the heavens before making their decision. \n\nSo if students don\u2019t like the decision of who they put in charge, they have an easy way to make life less stressful. They can apply for any of the hundreds of universities out there that offer their area of study\u2026probably even more woke than they can ever imagine, and go find a school that is fine with their ideology. BYU won\u2019t mind a bit to see you go. There will be other students who desire to follow the gospel and get a stellar education at the same time.  They\u2019d love to take your place.",

Did you happen to watch the video two years ago of a BYU student destroying chalk art murals with a water bottle while saying \u201call faggots go to hell.\u201d? That is simply a recorded example of the kind of homophobia I have heard and seen during my time at BYU. Thankfully, most students I\u2019ve interacted with are sensitive and care about being kind to those who don\u2019t fit the perfect Mormon paradigm, or are simply different from them. But there are plenty of bigoted students here who have not just unkind things to say about queer people, but violent tendencies toward them because they view the community as a threat to the gospel and the church. I\u2019d say if you\u2019re not a queer student at BYU, you\u2019ll never even begin to understand what it\u2019s like to exist in that space. It\u2019s not just difficult because gospel teachings are hard to square with being queer; it\u2019s difficult because there are students at the university who genuinely believe queer people should be kicked out of the school and/or banned from existing there in the first place. \n\nI can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re asking this question with genuine curiosity or with facetious condescension. If it\u2019s the latter, you should reevaluate your commitment to Christlike love and charity.",

I\u2019m 100% sincere here.\n\n&gt;Should LGBT+ have no right to expect a safe space \n\nAgain, the answer to that hinges on the presupposition of what *safety* entails. If a \u201csafe space\u201d refers to the same protections afforded to all students of the university against assault, theft, etc. by campus as Provo city police, then certainly. Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, et. al do not lose those same protections on account of their sexual desires. No special privileges are needed.\n\nIf, however, a \u201csafe space\u201d refers to an environment where those same sexual desires are not only accepted as morally valid but also celebrated, then no, I don\u2019t think students have a right to that. Rights *to* things require obligations on others to fulfill them.  Obligations which, in this circumstance, would require the violation of religious conscience. \n\n&gt;[should] homophobic students be allowed to say legitimately rude words to LGBT+ students \n\nNo, but the norms and standards for what constitutes taboo speech should not be dictated by those whose tendency is to view anything short of celebration as offensive. \n\nIn response to question 2:\n\nCertainly it *is* by definition a vast difference of opinion (about as vast a difference as one could imagine). Per my previous answer, I think that that incident fell outside of our norms and taboos, and that discipline was warranted. \n\nShould gay students view everyone without a rainbow flag pin as in league with that isolated individual? No. \n\nWas that incident violent?

Is this a personal definition/legal definition/BYU campus rule definition/LGBT+ student definition/ Activists definition? \n\n&gt;If a \u201csafe space\u201d refers to the same protections afforded to all students of the university against assault, theft, etc. by campus as Provo city police, then certainly.\n\nThe Police are not private security and cannot always prevent violence from happening. They are used for enforcement of law, hence law enforcement. And there is recent history of how the campus police and Provo police have done a failing grade level of enforcement when it comes to sexual assault cases at BYU. \n\n&gt;Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, et. al do not lose those same protections on account of their sexual desires. No special privileges are needed.\n\nNo special privileges are being asked. Equal protection is being asked. Not sure why this gets confused so much when it comes minorities asking for equality in society. \n\n\n&gt;If, however, a \u201csafe space\u201d refers to an environment where those same sexual desires are not only accepted as morally valid but also celebrated, then no, I don\u2019t think students have a right to that. Rights to things require obligations on others to fulfill them. Obligations which, in this circumstance, would require the violation of religious conscience.\n\nIts not like sexual desires of heterosexual  students is celebrated on campus, is it? Being a gay man doesn't equate instantly to celebrating that person's sexual desires all the time. There is more to a gay man than his sexual desires, just like a heterosexual student's life is not all about his/her sexual desires. Also there is a difference between sexual orientation and sexual desires eh? \n\nAnd when it comes to the term \"right\", it often gets cited in legalese terms, as if people will demand it from someone else. While some may go that route, I would think the vulnerable minority people in the society just want to be left alone and just want to be treated equally by everyone. BYU doesn't require every student to believe in LDS religion based on significant non-LDS student population and even the prayer rooms it offers on campus for many of its students. Why not treat LGBT+ students similarly and let them just be. \n\n &gt;No, but the norms and standards for what constitutes taboo speech should not be dictated by those whose tendency is to view anything short of celebration as offensive.\n\nSo who should dictate offense other than the people being targeted? Is calling someone faggot and hoping they all go to hell, and desecrating supportive art considered just a difference of opinion with no possibility of violence? \n\n&gt;Should gay students view everyone without a rainbow flag pin as in league with that isolated individual? No.\n\nHave BYU LGBT+ students demanded that or said that? Maybe one or two may have but I don't am not aware of that. Rainbow pin/flag or rainbow art just informs the LGBT+ student that they will not be discriminated for who they are and thus the use of the term \"safe space\". \n\n&gt;Was that incident violent? No. Speech is not violence.\n\nOf course speech is not violence. That's just pedantic and treating conversations as a court trial. :) \nSpeech where threats are made are to be taken seriously. Threats of violence are taken very seriously by US government and attempts to provide protection is made. \n\n\n&gt;With regards to the sidewalk chalk incident, if you feel otherwise, I would urge you or those with proper standing to seek legal redress in a court of law to get the justice and compensation you deserve.\n\nEfforts are already made and not everything needs to be drawn out in courts and through legal route. I don't think people enjoy lawyers or court rooms as much as watching them on TV shows. :) \n\nAnd again the intent is not get compensation or legal redress, but the intent is for equal treatment and creating an inclusive environment where LGBT+ students are treated equally as cis heterosexual students. I don't know why that is so hard to do. LGBT+ people are significant minority in our society and more so on campus. Why not let them just be? \n\nThe one fun thing that I always keep in mind is that for every gay student out there, it just reduces the competition for dating. So it should be a win win for male heterosexual student population who struggle with finding their partner on campus. :)",

Those are behaviors which will if unchecked almost always escalate to physical violence. The school refused to protect those students, or made them so fearful to come forward with concerns that they felt the need to leave. \n\nThe guy from the video had guns and nazi memorabilia in his room. One of those things is against the rules. I\u2019m sure that others who hold similar hatred masked by \u201copinions\u201d are still in attendance at BYU. \n\nAllowing hatred to fester unquestioned WILL inevitably lead to violence. \n\nAnd that\u2019s not to mention the higher rates of suicide among certain minority populations, which such speech and actions can only exacerbate. \n\nIf you think BYU should stay in the 50s, that\u2019s okay. Just say it loud and clear and don\u2019t try to use free speech to justify hate speech and vitriol. Those things lead to violence. Unquestionably and undeniably. \n\nYou want to make people who don\u2019t think or act like you hurt. Say it LOUD, so everyone can see your arguments for what they are.",

I haven\u2019t taken 388 or 382 so my options are\u2014\n\nAntitrust Law and Regulation 420\n\nLaw and economics 421\n\nMonetary theory and policy 453\n\nUrban economics 468\n\nGame theory and economics 478 \n\nDo any of these stand out as particularly interesting, useful, or easy?",

The material is interesting and it is cool to see how econ and law mix.  The course work is another thing. There are four dates during the semester where we had to memorize summaries of appellate court cases and we were randomly called on to deliver the summary of one case which was not horrible (10-15 cases each time). Then we had 5 homework sets that were comprised of multiple chapters (20-50 questions), but you get like 2-4 weeks to do them. There is a paper due at the end of the semester (7-10 pages). The test were ridiculously hard, but that is what Kearl is known for. You will not know your grade until Kearl submits them at the end of the semester so that is a little stressful.",

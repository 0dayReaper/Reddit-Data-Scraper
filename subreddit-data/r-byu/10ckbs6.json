It\u2019s a really big course load (I decided not to do it because of time), but if you\u2019re interested in the intersection of math and computing, that\u2019s your best bet. My other piece of advice is to just get a computer science minor if you\u2019re worried about when you\u2019ll graduate. The minor can go all the way up to the 400-level classes, and is really good.",

You can do just about anything with ACME - I'm applying to PhD programs right now, I have friends in government research positions, and others on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley, and even medical school. The program consists of prerequisites, a two-year core, and a concentration of your choice. There are around 28 official approved concentrations, and CS is definitely one of them. My understanding is that a CS minor only requires one or two more courses on top of the concentration requirements, so it's really easy to do.\n\nAs far as looking impressive goes, the biggest thing you need to figure out is how to communicate your skills and knowledge to employers or grad schools. This is especially important when you're looking at applied math - for some people, \"applied math\" literally just means ODEs, PDEs, and Dynamical Systems, which are a part of ACME but definitely not the whole thing. The more you're able to market yourself (and I really just mean being able to talk about everything you learn in school) the more recruiters and admissions will understand what you can do and the more opportunities you will have.\n\nFeel free to DM if you'd like to talk more. ACME should be holding some recruiting events soon, too. Keep your eyes open for 'em.",

            "comment": "BYU is really picky about double majors. My understanding is if you can't show that you can complete the coursework without delaying your graduation, they generally don't approve it. I was in the physics department, and virtually everyone who successfully completed a double major had to pick one or both of their degrees to be a more applied program that let them use required classes in one program as electives in the other. For example, ACME/physics, CS/applied physics, and math/applied physics were the most common pairings I saw. It's going to be much the same story in math and CS.\n\nCS is 74 credits, pure math is 53.5, and I counted up to 26 overlapping credits with a careful choice of electives. You'd be able to count CS 235 as a math elective, and you could count MATH 410 and 485 as both math and CS electives. You'd also need to pick STAT 201 on the statistics option to count for both programs. The total would be a 101.5 credit program, which is comparable in length to the chemical and mechanical engineering programs (which take most people five years to complete). If you've got credit for both PHSCS 121 (calculus-based Newtonian mechanics) and MATH 112 and 113 (Calc 1 and 2), you can potentially drop that down another 11 credits to 90.5. That's still a lot, but it *might* be doable in four years if you have enough GEs out of the way.\n\n&gt;I have experience with juggling lots of classes\u2014I took 6 APs last year (two of them online)\n\nTake it from someone who entered with a lot of AP credit, had a great ACT score, and had a perfect high school GPA -- BYU classes are a lot harder than AP classes. You also have to take into account how your coursework overlaps. You don't want to be that kid that ends up taking CS 240 at the same time you're doing MATH 341 or 342, which is an entirely conceivable scenario inside a double major.",

When people hear I'm doing this, they often ask why I didn't just do ACME, but honestly I'm really interested in both math and computer science, and so I didn't feel like I would be fully satisfied just doing ACME, as I would miss out on a lot of the pure CS classes, but I also didn't feel satisfied just doing CS, since then I would miss out on the theory and mathematical rigor that you get from the math major. \n\nThat being said, the double-major is definitely a lot of work and I've had my hands pretty full with school ever since beginning at BYU. Depending on how much credits you got during high school, it will be easier or harder. I was lucky enough to be able to get an associates degree during high school as part of a concurrent enrollment program, so that really helped me get a leg-up, as I don't have to worry about generals. But that being said, I was left with a bunch of heavy math and CS classes that I had to take at the same time, which can be a little rough. \n\nTLDR: All in all, I would say if you really love math and computer science and are like me where you can't even dream of divorcing the two, then go for it! But do keep in mind that it is a demanding course-load and will probably not be easy. Sometimes I regret my decision to do a double-major because of the amount of work that is attached with it, but all-in-all, I think this regret will be much smaller in comparison to the regret that I would get for not fully pursuing my dreams.",

Math classes are a time commitment. Calc 1 and 2 are 4 credits each, mostly because of the amount of homework you get. Upper division courses are quite time consuming as well, despite only being 2-3 credits. Compsci can also be a big time commitment. If you're okay with taking about 5 years or doing Springs and Summers (even with your AP credits), I'd say go for it, otherwise consider the minor option. \n\nThis is what minors were kinda made for. You can decide which one you want to be your focus and have the other be a minor. You can even take classes not required for your major or minor for fun (you'll never get tuition this cheap again).\n\nJuggling a lot of classes in high school and juggling a lot of classes at BYU are different ball games. To do well in college I typically tell people to put their max effort into the fewest possible number of classes. First semester of freshman year is very important, since you have the highest probability of getting a scholarship if you do well at the end. Try doing 12-13 credit hours instead of 15-18.",

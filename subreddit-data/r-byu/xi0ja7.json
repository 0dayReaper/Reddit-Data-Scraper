I feel like everywhere I go, especially to any Church-sponsored event, there's crazy pressure to get married. It's to the point where as a single woman who isn't dating because I'm simply trying to keep myself afloat, I feel less than married young adults. It's hard to find data or much evidence of BYU's toxic pressure. Has anybody else felt there's suffocating pressure at BYU to get married or even that we should put dating above our mental health?",

            "comment": "I had a similar mental health crash on this topic about two years ago.\n\nUnfortunately, I won't deny the culture exists. However, I would say the pressure is lessening with each passing day. I am not saying what I have noticed applies to everyone.\n\nPersonally, I don't get pressure from my peers anymore. The viewpoint for much of the younger generation appears to be shifting away from this mentality.\n\nMy parents have even stopped after I explained why my mental health had crashed (there were other factors, but the dating pressure was the largest).\n\nIt's reached the point where my YSA Bishop even hesitates to give a lesson on dating, and even if he does he gets lots of input from the Ward Council on how to proceed.\n\nWe grew up hearing fairytale like stories from our parents and grandparents about knowing they were \"the one\". Heck, we grew up with all the literal fairytales being produced by Disney and other companies. Gratefully, we are starting to realize the instant fairytales are not a common occurrence.\n\nMy tipping point is when I finally realized it is MY life, and I make the choices. I had the financial means to really begin exploring my hobbies, and in time I became very happy with who I was because I absolutely knew I was making the choices I thought were best for me, not what the society around me thought was best for me.\n\nSo yes, the pressure and culture does exist. Yes, it does seem to be getting better. No, I can't exactly tell you what can help you to shoulder and ignore the pressure, but maybe my experience can help you or someone else begin to lift their slumped shoulders again.",

I have so many ppl asking me if I'm dating anyone/why I'm not dating etc. I'm not in school to get married, I'm here to get a degree and start my career. If a relationship happens then great, but you have to prioritize yourself and your future first. \n\nI know so many young female professionals from byu that aren't married either and they are very content in their life. \n\nTo be honest, if your feeling pressure at ysa events etc, just don't go. The whole point of them is to try and encourage the whole dating sphere and that's not my vibe so I'm just as happy chillen by myself. I find I'm way happier doing my own thing then being forced to do cringe get to know you games.",

I promise you that here in the bay area it is very much the norm for people to not be married, and no one is viewed as lesser. \n\nI definitely know what you mean about feeling lesser when you're not married in Utah. BYU really pushes that narrative too, giving married students higher privileges in choosing housing. It felt like getting married would move me to some higher social standing, and that whenever a friend got married they were suddenly too good for me. \n\nIt's very much a Utah thing, from my experience.",

            "comment": "You are not alone in feeling that pressure. Long ago when I was an undergraduate our stake presidents wife wisely counseled us to stop trying to find a date on Sunday. I believe the line she used was, \u201cChurch is not a meat market and we don\u2019t shop on Sunday.\u201d \n\nThe pressure is sometimes unconscious or intentional as most of these events are being planned by your peers. This gets especially toxic when it\u2019s young men who were told by their mission presidents that the next step is to go home and find their new eternal companions. It can be very tiresome. \n\nHowever here is some advice. \n\nTake care of you and get to a place you feel stable and content with who you are. Finding personal happiness with who you are and your needs will help you more in the long run than rushing into marriage. Then once you\u2019re happy with you I am sure things will fall into place for what you need in a relationship.",

I stayed like 8 more years. Single.\n\nFor what it's worth, the pressure to marry evaporated when I turned 30 for some reason. But as a single, you never get treated like an adult. The kicker was going with a bunch of late 20s/early 30s to a dance *chaperoned by a 22-year-old couple!*. Evidently, marriage (and not life experience from age) is what makes someone mature in LDS culture.\n\nIt gets better when you move away. SL county is better. Out of state is best.  I'm still single at age 37, but here in California that's totally normal and okay. Girls don't see me as damaged goods.",

I was a physics major and spent a lot of time in a ward that leaned very heavily toward STEM majors -- after a few feeble attempts, the bishopric and ward council gave up and decided they were happy just to see us talking to other people outside of a classroom.\n\nPerhaps some of that is also because we rebelled. On one occasion, the FHE committee decided it was a great idea to have all the FHE groups prepare videos about dating for a group FHE. Absolutely none of them were serious, and at least a couple of them were just various jokes about carbon dating; we all knew it was stupid, and the idea never got used again.\n\nI do remember the occasional talk from a member of the stake presidency encouraging us all to date more, but they usually fell on deaf ears. The guys and girls who were trying to date a lot still dated a lot, and those of us that were more concerned with trying to stay afloat in our classes were still trying to stay afloat in our classes.\n\nBut it does get better. I moved out to Pennsylvania for graduate school after finishing my bachelor's at BYU, and the expectations are quite different. The topic still occasionally comes up, but it's much less frequent and with far less force behind it (\"Are you interested in anybody?\" vs. \"Why aren't you dating anyone?\" or \"You should go out on more dates!\").",

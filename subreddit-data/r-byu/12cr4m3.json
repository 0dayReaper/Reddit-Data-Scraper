    "postText": "So I was still largely undecided about whether or not I should come for the Fall semester after getting accepted; however, I finally made my decision to come for the Fall semester and I'm not sure if housing is still available to 18yr Freshman. Do I need to go on a waiting list for on campus housing? I'm still very new to this whole process.",

BYU\u2019s off-campus website will have a list of BYU Approved Housing off campus that you can apply to if you\u2019re interested in that",

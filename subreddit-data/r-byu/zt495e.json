Idk if you\u2019ve been following me but it has not been going my way in the NFL. I\u2019m currently making this comment from the sideline of the game tonight and it is rough. I\u2019ve only thrown for 84 yards through 3 quarters and I think I\u2019m gonna get benched (again) for Joe Flacco. Anyways here is my list:\n\n1. Respect women: All women deserve respect but especially mothers. They have a lot they can teach you just trust me. \n\n2. Just say no to drugs: I can proudly say that I have never done any drugs and don\u2019t plan on it. Had a cousin that died from injecting a marijuana. Scary stuff. \n\n3. Clean language: I have never said a cuss word in my life. I get some strange looks from my teammates when I say stuff like \u201cfetch\u201d or \u201cshiz\u201d but it is worth it. \n\nSorry that\u2019s all I got for now, gotta get back on the field. Good luck with your project!",

    "postText": "Thank you so much for having construction work right in front of the library during finals week! Am I the only that finds this annoying? I really don\u2019t have access to many places with good wifi and I really love the quiet area but they decide to have it during this week out of all weeks of the year? Maybe it\u2019s because this is my second semester but I really hope this isn\u2019t the norm",

Thanks to the extremely wet winter we had this year, the roof of that section of the library has been leaking. BYU is replacing the old waterproofing membrane in order to stop the leaks. The timing is unfortunate, especially with the demolition of the HFAC and the construction of the new arts building, graduation, etc., but the work needs to be done. We were told it will take about 8 months.",

The Library had been mainly finished with the HUGE hole in the quad filled in and the library massively expanded.",

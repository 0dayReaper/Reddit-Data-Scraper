    "postText": "I have to take MKTG 201 this upcoming fall or winter to apply to the business program. The only 2 professors available for fall are Swenson and Rackham and both of them have terrible rate my professor reviews. Are there different professors in the winter? What was your experience with them? Looking for the easiest one because I am also taking Econ with Platt or Pope.",

Retook it with rackham at the salt lake center, and found his tests to be slightly easier and his stories way more interesting.  Be sure to attend his class, because the stories he tells are used on the exam.",

He\u2019s not too bad and if you\u2019re applying to the business school and got good grades in accounting or finance, then you\u2019ll be just fine in his marketing class. I also took Econ from pope and enjoyed his class!",

The tests were a little tricky but I got a good grade. I made some test quizlets, so if you end up taking it from him let me know and I will hook you up. If you can memorize terms you\u2019ll be fine",

In my experience they\u2019ve involved more busy work then just doing them in person as well. Anthropology 101 is super easy if you end up taking it in person but I\u2019m not sure IS",

Motivation is key, but just try to keep yourself on a semester plan. I recommend Tech Writing through IS, for sure, as well as other English classes. Def do the work well before the end of the time - some profs take forever to grade assignments that you need back to finish a final paper or project.",

I'm a senior now and am currently taking History of the Soviet Union. I LOVE IT! I'm only about halfway through but it hasn't been too hard. Lots and lots of reading and papers, but it's really engaging.",

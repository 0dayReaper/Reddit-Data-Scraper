I'm not too worried ab the fact that they'll be an RA, but I do kinda want to get in touch with them to see what they're like and to figure things out with the apartment. when I go to the housing page, it doesn't say who I'll be living with- it just says \"not available\". does that just mean no ones been assigned there yet or is that not how I find out who's there? is there any way I can figure out who I'll be with before I move in?  any advice appreciated (:",

I would contact BYU housing directly and ask.\n\nIf it helps, in my experience RAs are almost all super chill and they get the best rooms so I wouldn't worry too much about living with one.",

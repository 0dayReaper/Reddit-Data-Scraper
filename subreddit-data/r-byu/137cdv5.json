    "postText": "I\u2019m asking this a bit preemptively, as my last semester will be Winter 2024, but I wanted to get ahead on thinking of classes so I\u2019m not stressing out during the fall. I\u2019m a psychology major, but the only class I\u2019ll have left that last semester is my capstone. I\u2019ll also be in Women\u2019s Chorus, so that puts me at 4 credits for Winter 2024. I need a full 15-credit schedule to have enough credits to graduate. I will also have all my religion credits and gen ed credits completed. So, what are some fun and fairly easy elective classes I can use to fill the gap? I would prefer 2 or 3 credit classes, as I don\u2019t want to go overboard with the number of classes I take. Any and all advice is appreciated; thank you so much!",

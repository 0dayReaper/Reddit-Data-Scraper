    "postText": "I am a sophomore and I was thinking of taking precalculus 1 and 2 this summer on BYU online independent study and was wondering if this can be done reasonably during this summer. I want to do this to do calc bc junior year. I feel that I am pretty strong in math, honors algebra 2/trig for me this year has been a breeze I barely studied. What are your guys thoughts? Should I do this?",

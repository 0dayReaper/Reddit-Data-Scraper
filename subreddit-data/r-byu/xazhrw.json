    "postText": "Hi all,\nI want to take Math 113 at BYU Independent Study and wanted to know that, upon completion, would the credits transfer to a University of California school (UCI in my case).\n\nI also wanted to know how fast I can complete the course. Is there a minimum amount of time I have to be enrolled to receive credit? Or is it possible if I can finish everything and receive credit after a few days?\n\nIn addition, I also wanted to know how fast it takes to send credits from BYU Independent Study to another school and how long it takes for credits to be established in my BYU academic record.",

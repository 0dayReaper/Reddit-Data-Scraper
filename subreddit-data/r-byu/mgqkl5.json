Truly unethical academic behavior, not swearing or drinking which are common at nearly every other university. You are saying you wish his life was ruined.\n\nBefore you come for me, I'm having a hard time with my faith for a variety of reasons, but I'm still a member in good standing and a BYU Alumnus.

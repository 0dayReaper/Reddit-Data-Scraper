The honor code office should not have the power to pull your ecclesiastical endorsement after you\u2019ve repented and your bishop says you are okay. The honor code office is encouraging students to not go through the process of repentance for fear of being expelled, which only promotes sin. How is it that we can work through issues with our bishop and be okay with the Lord, but the \u201cLord\u2019s school\u201d can say we didn\u2019t repent enough and punish us for it? ",

Much of the tattling culture at least in my experience revolves around those dress and grooming rules. If people got in trouble for cheating on tests and found out then that's wholly expected, but roommates tattling on other roommates because they saw them wearing short shorts or because a girl stayed over in their living room later than curfew is just childish. \n\nIn the end, why are students being held to a higher standard than the one required to go to the Lord's house? If you can go to the temple while having a beard, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to go to school with one and so on with all the other standards that are just there because of the school president in the 70's.",

So students can only be disciplined in their university status by being convicted of committing a sexual crime such as rape or sexual assault. Also students should not be disciplined for drinking alcohol or using drugs but instead will be encouraged and assisted to seek help with counseling and drug or alcohol treatment if their alcohol use or drug use is impairing their ability to succeed academically. The only violations regarding alcohol or drug use that should jeopardize academic standing and university enrollment should involve giving alcohol or drugs to another person for the purpose of exploiting them sexually or as a part of committing a crime such as distribution of controlled substances.  The honor code office, if it is allowed to exist at all, should be involved in serious cases of academic dishonesty by students and faculty and sexual harassment and exploitation on campus by students and faculty.

The petition is trying to change the honor code that that BYU administration has set. Instead of getting all fired up and complaining about the honor code why don\u2019t you just go to another university if you don\u2019t agree to or if you can\u2019t live by the honor code at the BYU. When you applied to BYU and you were at were excepted and each time you get your endorsement done you promise that you\u2019ll live by the honor code and if you think it\u2019s so hard to live by it and you think it\u2019s \u201coutdated \u201c because the BYU honor code has it\u2019s standards and not the world\u2019s standards then go to another institution. BYU is a PRIVATE institution. If you don\u2019t agree then transfer to another university or apply for a different institution that fits you.",

Why does BYU think itself more 'holy' than the house of the Lord?",

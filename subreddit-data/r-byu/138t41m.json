    "postText": "Quick question. I am an incoming freshman to BYU coming from high school. When I originally applied I sent BYU my concurrent enrollment credit earned from my junior year of high school from Weber State through Student Clearinghouse. I would like to transfer the credit I earned senior year as well. Does anyone know if I need to send another transcript or should they already have access to it because I sent it when I applied? Any info helps ty!",

I would assume that getting the credits from another school would be a one-time thing and that there's not much of a need to tie your records together in separate systems.\n\nBut talking to the registrar's office would be the only definitive answer.",

In the short drive home from the creamery to my apartment, I counted three different times I had to brake so I didn't hit someone jaywalking. I know waiting for the light is annoying, but you know what's even more annoying? Medical bills and physical therapy to learn to walk again. \n\nRant over, stay safe out there",

The bike safety class I went to said that it's more dangerous to ride on the shoulder because car traffic will pass by you only one or two feet away. If you ride in the lane (close-ish to the edge), then the cars will pass you the way they pass a car--changing to a different lane--which forces them to get much farther away when they pass.",

It's dramatically safer to take the lane.\n\nI suppose you have a different risk tolerance when deciding between dealing with the constant danger of being clipped while riding on the right with the very rare occurrence of someone running you down from behind (which would likely still happen anyway if you're on the right side of the lane and an inattentive driver decides to murder you).",

Yeah, it's crazy rude to jaywalk when other vehicles are waiting for you, but if you're going fast enough to where breaking on time is impossible, you ought to be held legally responsible for driving that fast (or often distractedly) in a crowded area. I see way too many distracted and fast drivers on campus roads that make the area so much more dangerous for a non-driver like me",

I didn\u2019t see her because of the cars parked along the side of the road. She didn\u2019t look up from her phone once. Had to slam on my brakes. It pissed me off but I didn\u2019t engage with her. \n\nThe people in Provo live in a different world so they see no problem with walking around the roads looking down at their phones. The drivers are obnoxious and run red lights and never yield to anything. Most importantly - the city was planned by a four year old. Every turn lane is 20 times shorter than standard, unnecessary roads randomly have 6 lanes. Stop signs are placed around at the most unpredictable places. People are constantly getting hit in this city and that\u2019s not okay. I\u2019ve driven in many other cities but only Provo feels like a terrible Sims City run. \n\nSometimes when drivers are assholes or pedestrians are complete idiots, I have to just take a deep breath and credit it to the city planning. I feel like it\u2019s hard to blame just ONE party here, everyone loses.",

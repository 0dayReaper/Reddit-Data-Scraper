    "postText": "I'll be doing military training this whole summer abroad but still need to knock out some credits this spring term. Any recommendations for a religion class I could knock out every Sunday in a couple hours?\n\nI need to take Foundations of the Restoration and two random religion ones, like survey of Christianity or Survey of Judiasm &amp; Islam.\n\nIf you could give a specific professor that's easy as well (especially their on-demand course), that'd be extra clutch. Thanks!",

I loved that class and could usually do it all over the weekend, except for a couple of assignments here and there of course. Ended up being one of my favorite religion classes though cuz he\u2019s just the best professor.",

It\u2019s the kind of exam though where you have a comprehensive study guide and as long as you know the entire study guide you\u2019ll be fine.",

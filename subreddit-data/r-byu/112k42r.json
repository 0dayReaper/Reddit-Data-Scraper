Furthermore, BYU professors and students just published a report explaining that there needs to be emergency measures to save the great salt lake. I\u2019m not sure why you bothered posting this here considering BYU is one of the main proponents of saving the lake \n\nhttps://pws.byu.edu/great-salt-lake",

Ben Abbott, a Brigham Young University ecologist and a devout Mormon, calls it \u201ca shockingly prophetic directive\u201d \u2014 a directive many modern Mormons conveniently overlook.\"",

Or to talk about what a theocracy Utah is, \"it's the church running the show there\". How much feed grown in Utah is used in Utah? How much livestock raised is consumed in Utah from herds in Utah? Point where on the line excessive meat consumption is. This piece is crap.",

But these are pipe (or pipeline) dreams. Only the immediate and severe reductions in water use from the rivers and creeks that feed the lake will save this resource.\n\n&gt;Reductions will hit agriculture the hardest, because farms use most of the water. Roughly 85 percent of Utah\u2019s water goes to agriculture \u2014 the vast majority to a single crop: alfalfa, used to feed livestock. Though nearly 70 percent of Utah\u2019s diverted water goes to alfalfa and hay, the crops account for only 0.2 percent of the state\u2019s gross domestic product.",

            "comment": "Closing 3 grafs:\n\n&gt;Somewhere along the way, Mormon culture devolved from embracing stewardship of the land to accepting nearly unfettered development. Mormon conservatism blocks appropriate zoning of urban expansion and precludes meaningful restrictions on water use. Politically, Utah is not equipped to tell farmers and developers what to do \u2014 yet the Great Salt Lake might live or die based on this spring\u2019s legislative session.\n\n&gt;The best solution at this point is the simplest one: buy the water rights from enough Utah farmers to stabilize the lake. This would honor private property rights that are so important to Western conservatives, while moving quickly to save a priceless resource. A prosperous state pioneered by conservationist Mormons, Utah can afford this answer and learn to love it, too.\n\n&gt;Abbott, lead author of the dire report, and others suggest that the destiny of Mormons is to care for this vast, beautiful, fragile land \u2014 not to drink it dry and reduce it to toxic dust. The pioneering people who sought refuge in the valley of the Great Salt Lake left a legacy that can help save the West from its own success. The environmental crisis unfolding at the Great Salt Lake is a microcosm of the climate realities of the entire region, where the Mormon story has sown both the seeds of a crisis and of a solution.",

Your rebuttal to the first part of my argument is a dual fallacy.  Red herring and straw man.  You attempt to equate Young with the \"founding fathers\", which is both distracting, and unfair to Washington and company.  Not one of them claimed that they spoke for God.  Young, however, did make this claim.  Young, claiming to be the mouth-piece of the Judeo-Christian God, preached that blood atonement (which could be voluntary or otherwise) of all parties (and resultant children) was the only path to divine absolution for interracial marriage,  that all people of color were cursed by God, and excluded them from eternal salvation by denying them the rites of the \"priesthood\".\n\nSo,  to answer the only part of your rebuttal that is relevant, yes.  BYU is racist for continuing to honor a uniquely racist man, who claimed authority from God to condone violence and institute systemic racism in the church which directs BYU, 150 years after his death.  They are also racist for honoring all the racist men who led Young's church and perpetuated Young's teachings after his death.\n\nDo you have any more questions that are actually relevant?",

We'd do it because not hurting others is the right thing to do, and not to appease Twitter users or the NCAA (who expressly forbids it and can sanction the university if it happens again).",

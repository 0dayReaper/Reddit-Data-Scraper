Any opinions on which of these would be most beneficial to a manufacturing engineering major, which professors are good, which professors to avoid, or which class is the easiest? Thanks!",

            "comment": "As for MCOM 320, It is decently heavy. Lots of lengthy assignments that you have to be very precise and thoughtful in your writing. That being said, if you just want to pass with a B/B- and don\u2019t care about getting a great grade, its curved like most business school classes and you can pretty easily get a middle of the pack grade.\n\nI will say, it is an incredibly useful class and you might want to consider waiting until you can have one of the normal professors. My professor (K Newell) was one of the best professors I have had at BYU. She helped me improve my writing and communication skills in a way that was super fun and engaging. It has undoubtedly been the best non-major course I have taken at BYU. Super helpful if you have any desire to be in management down the read.",

I spend maybe an hour per work on the class, if not less. \n\nI\u2019m taking it from Deborah Galley. She has a STEM background and does a great job of explaining the writing process in a succinct, technical way. 10/10 would recommend.",

You will have class or a semi mandatory lab every weekday. You will likely spend a lot of time on the homework or in the TA lab. Studying for tests is brutal and the two hour review sessions are very important.",

I got out of AHTG but Phys121 I've taken - the material is dead easy if you've taken physics before but the tests are worded terribly and the teachers are meh at best. It was time intensive but not mentally intensive.\nIn general, you need to find what a good workload is for you, which tbh will jsut atk esome experimentation. Personally, 15 or 16 credits is my sweet spot, but it depends how much time you want to spend socializing and how fast you want to graduate, etc.",

Even if you are working &lt;5 hours, I'd still say that it is fine.\n\n235 is difficult if you have little experience with data structures in general (though I took it under Roper, who has left the class IIRC and had a very different schedule for the class, so take that with a grain of salt).\n\nI'm a former 260 TA and can assure you that the class content is rather easy- it just has the busiest work out of any CS class (as in small busywork- lots of smaller projects as compared to a couple of big ones).\n\nReligion classes are rather unpredictable in their difficulty, and I never took Math 113, so I can't speak from that angle. Overall though, I think you could fit 121 in there pretty well.",

I would highly recommend getting ahead with projects when possible and visit the TA's as soon as you have a question about anything. That helped me a ton. However, my professor told our class some things in CS 235 are changing next semester as they move from teaching the course in C++ to python to make the transition from CS 111 easier so your mileage  with this advice may vary.\n\nAs for Math 113 and Physics, there were a surprising number of people that took both classes at the same time which made finding people to do study groups for both classes a whole lot easier. Like others have said, there is a big time commitment for both classes (about 2 or so hours of homework for Math 113 per lecture day and about the same per homework in Physics plus time for studying for the midterms every other week). My advice for both is to utilize the TA labs as much as you can and keep on top of things. \n\nGood luck!",

I just took 235 and 260 last semester haha.\n\nCS 235 isn't conceptually hard, but just make sure to start the labs early because they can take a while. I survived in that class by visiting the TAs regularly. There are a lot of them and if you visit early enough you can get the help you need. Trying to get TA help can get hectic right before labs are due.\n\nCS 260 also wasn't very difficult conceptually, but the coursework was a little much imo. It felt like one week there would be a lab due and the next week there was a creative project (pretty much a second lab) where you do something you want using what was recently learned in class. It's totally doable, but it can feel like a lot. (This might vary with the professor. I took it from Dr. Clement and this was how the class was organized).\n\nI didn't have much trouble with Math 113, but I think it depends on the professor. It is time intensive with both online and physical homework. Make sure to stay on top of the material because learning series can be the worst. Also, make sure you get a study buddy. It's really helpful to review with someone else right before midterms and the final.\n\nI haven't taken physics yet, but I personally put a cap on STEM classes at 3 a semester. They can get pretty heavy with coursework and I like having flexibility in figuring out what needs to be done and when with various due dates. If you want another 3 credits, I'd recommend a GE. I took a civ class last semester and it was a nice change-up from my CS classes.\n\nHope this essay helps haha. Good luck! You got this!",

Personally, I found the theory half of 235 to be a little difficult but the coding wasn\u2019t terrible at all, you\u2019ll do great if you just don\u2019t get behind and attend class (I got bored of my prof and stopped attending lecture, definitely not a good move in retrospect)\n\nAll in all, I think you\u2019ve got a good schedule right now and will probably be able to handle adding that one more class",

I've taken upper level math and 113 isn't that bad conceptually, but the daily homeworks, recitations etc are pretty demanding. Physics on top of that might be a lot to juggle since iirc when I took it there were like 6 midterms. If I were you, I'd opt for an easier GE (I had a good time with arts and letters for example) but it all depends if you are targeting a specific major/focus area.",

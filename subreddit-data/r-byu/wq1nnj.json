    "postText": "I just transferred to BYU and am having a really hard feeling settled on my major. I am currently a Psych major. My original plan was to become an Attorney, but after working as a Paralegal in a law firm, I was exposed to a lot and became very disenchanted with the profession to say the least.\n\nI think I'm just scared of picking something and then figuring out it's not the right fit. With my transfer credits, I have fulfilled all my electives requirements and nearly all my GE requirements. \n\nMy concern with my Psychology degree is it seems like there is not a lot you can do outside of becoming a therapist. It seems like something I could like, but I am deterred by it because my sister is a therapist.\n\nMy other dilemma is picking something I can actually make money in. I don't have to make buckets, but I want to be at least financially stable and not always stressed about money.\n\nRight now I am also interested in the Dietetics Program and the Advertising Program. I am also looking into Physical Therapy. I have already met with an advisor for major exploration but they didn't give me a lot of information. \n\nAny career advice/insights greatly appreciated!!!!!!!",

            "comment": "The reality of Psychology degrees is that everyone and their mother gets them, and the overwhelming majority of those who get them end up in careers where their degree doesn\u2019t matter, the job just wanted you to have one. So how much money you make with the degree (unless you go to grad school) is really more dependent on what other skills you pick up than your actual degree, and if you only know Psychology chances are that the jobs you get won\u2019t pay particularly well.\n\nNothing super wrong with that, it\u2019s the same thing that happens to people who get other \u201cuseless\u201d degrees like History or Philosophy, Studio C sketches not withstanding. Honestly your time is probably better spent going to a trade school though; a good electrician usually makes more money than pretty much anything else I mention in this post.\n\nI don\u2019t know much about the dietetics program.\nAdvertising (or really anything business related) is a solid choice for getting a decent career.\nPhysical Therapy is a good and important career, but Physical Therapists are criminally underpaid for the amount of schooling they go through because the government and insurance companies don\u2019t understand how important physical therapy is.",

I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re all equally bad (they\u2019re not), but nothing is as glamorous or black and white as it seems from the outside.\n\nI grew up hearing that you should pick something you love to do for your career, and that way you\u2019ll love going to work every day. My real world experience has been the opposite. That mindset just made me stressed out, because I never did find anything that I \u201cloved\u201d. When I reset my expectations and just accepted that work is work and doesn\u2019t need to be something I\u2019m really passionate about, I actually enjoyed it more. I got rid of the expectation that I had to love it\u2026 I just had to be good at it. I ended up earning a lot of money and used it to be generous and to have the time to do non work things that I do feel passionate about. \n\nGood luck in your decision!",

You can also probably pick up a minor in something like business or something else you are interested in to round out what you are doing. You can also look at graduate programs which don't require undergrad work in the program. I have a friend who got a degree in one topic but ended up doing graduate school in another area.   \n\n\nYou could also go into education. You might look at the instructional design and psychology program which is about designing curriculum and finding ways to help people learn. BYU has a Graduate and PHD program in that. The Design minor is also pretty fun looking at the class options.   \n\n\nSo don't give up there are lots of ways to make your degree work.",

I believe the career counseling office should still offer it. \n\nMost people get a degree that stretches their brain in some way, and then they go work for a corporation. It's a big funnel that scoops up people from every background. Some people will disagree, but sometimes it comes down to picking a field you are engaged in enough to accumulate a handful of really rewarding experiences\n\nI studied economics and statistics, was a spreadsheet jockey for awhile, went back and studied public administration, launched a startup, worked a few marketing and account management jobs for software companies. Now I work in travel publishing and consult with a few startups on content strategy. I rarely use the methods I learned in undergrad, but I benefit every day from the exercise I put my brain through.",

It\u2019ll probably take twice as long as they quote, too. \n\nIf you want cheaper, same-day repair then see if there\u2019s a Ubreakifix in northern Provo that would probably do it in-store and charge less than Apple, but the screens likely aren\u2019t official Apple screens. But you also won\u2019t find official Apple screens for less than Apple/an Apple certified service center would charge.",

If you do that make sure you have a new water proof seal ready and screen adhesive, you can buy some off of the ifixit website unless you know of another vendor.",

Last I checked an OEM XR replacement will cost you about 180$ at an Apple store. You could do the repair yourself and it would run you close to 100$ for the screen and you should be able to do it, but unless you have an Apple screen configuration, tru tone and the pen function (didn\u2019t know the XR could use the pen) will not work upon instal of the new screen. Your best bet would be the Apple repair shop on campus but that is going to be expensive, sorry man.",

There is always a social or cultural event going on, everything from formal to informal. There\u2019s always dances, parties, get-togethers, clubs, pick up games, activity clubs\u2026 While  I went there, I played soccer both in pick up games and in intramurals, I took dance classes, went country, swing, and pop dancing, did Disco rolled skating, played volleyball, basketball, and football, went to games, went to hundreds of get-togethers of some sort of another including FHE, saw theater plays and music performances, and generally had a blast. I describe it as a four year youth conference with homework and finals.\n\nIf you are into wholesome, clean fun, there\u2019s not  better place on earth.",

            "comment": "A lot of what you see on Reddit that is negative about BYU is exaggerated. Reddit has a disproportionate number of people who are ideologically opposed to the church that sponsors the university so you get a lot more negativity here than you see in the real world.\n\nThat said, the most incorrect assumption I think is that everybody is judgmental or whatever. Obviously that exists, but I don't think it's nearly as bad as is sometimes implied. There's also the recent controversy related to the alleged (but unsubstantiated) racist things said at the volleyball game and the claim by said ideologically opposed people that the school is somehow a haven for racism. I've heard bad stories but I've also talked to minorities at BYU who have never had any kind of racist incident while at the school.\n\nThere are things that are true that you should probably be willing to just accept. Yes, a lot of students here are married and the dating scene can be a little weird. Yes, you will be expected to live according to the Honor Code on and off campus. If you're not willing to abide by the Honor Code I'd recommend not going because you will probably just be happier at another school. Most people don't care at all about rules like the beard rule but there's a chance you'll be called out on it by certain campus services. The school is also overwhelmingly composed of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with all the cultural quirks that come with that, so if you're not a member of that religion it'll be a considerable culture shock. If you're a part of the LGBT community, I'd advise you not to go yet because the school is still wrestling with how to balance its religious principles with regard to that, both culturally and institutionally.\n\nThat said, there are also great things that you may or may not have heard about BYU. I've observed that there is a culture of academic integrity here. People here are honest as a general rule, I've never heard of an incident like I've heard of at other universities where entire classes have gotten in trouble for cheating. Students at BYU are also there to learn, there isn't a party scene like at other schools. Classes are challenging and interesting, I've never taken a class where I've left feeling like I learned nothing. Even general education classes are more challenging than you might find at other schools, which can be great and also annoying.\n\nPerhaps most importantly to me is how much the professors care. At BYU, most professors are getting paid considerably less than they would be if they were working at other universities or in private industry, so if a professor is here it's because they want to be here. All of my professors have been heavily invested in their students' education and care deeply about the subjects they teach.",

I'm a white guy, but I've heard way more n words coming from white people at byu than I had ever heard in my life. To be fair, that number before coming to byu was 1, so the fact that I heard it from literally anyone that wasn't black was appalling to me and I can easily see how someone would think byu is racist.\n\nI agree that people here aren't nearly as judgmental as people say they are, but I think it's the 10% that actually are judgemental that can make it a living hell for some people. \n\nAs an example, I'm very much at odds with the church for personal reasons, and all of my close friends know I'll be leaving the church as soon as I graduate. I've never been criticized by anyone after opening up to them about that, but I have a pretty long list of people that I associate with that I would likely never feel comfortably opening up with about that stuff. The stress of having to pretend to be someone I'm not every day at school combined with constant jokes/insults I here about people who leave the church or \"sins\" that I commit pretty regularly now can be taxing. I know none of them are intentionally trying to make me feel isolated, but they definitely do. \n\nIf you find a good group of friends, though, it's tolerable.",

Many of my peers went on to top graduate schools. Just be prepared for an extensive GE program with large classes. \n\nBe careful about who you choose for your (mandatory) religious classes. Some of the teachers are very good and try to aim for those - if you're not careful you'll end up in a glorified Sunday School section taught by a Biology professor who drew the short straw. \n\nThere is actually quite a bit of world culture to explore, even if a lot of it is second-hand from people who have served missions and brought the food/language back with them; so the on-campus culture is filtered through that lens. But if you are interested in having an international experience, there are many opportunities to get out and do that.\n\nThere is a certain prevailing political culture and you're not going to get around it. I went through the Econ undergraduate program, and there was a strong libertarian angle to everything. Many Mountain West LDS people grow up hearing grievance politics and may look down on the rest of the world - if you cross paths with someone's hot-button inherited beliefs, you will get defensive push-back. There is plenty of self-righteousness everywhere, and you're likelier to encounter the conservative version in Provo. But I truly enjoyed most of the other students I was able to spend time with - I do believe that college is THE place for people to start exploring territory outside of their worldview and reshape their beliefs about one another. So try to give people a little leeway.",

UIUC is routinely one of the best STEM/accounting schools out there and those programs are *insanely* hard to get into. The acceptance rates for *majors* at UIUC are polarizingly different between disciplines.\n\nAlmost all the STEM programs are like top 10 good.  STEM is like sub 25% (I'm told CS is like 12%, mechanical eng is like 17%, civil eng is like 15% and condensed matter physics ranges from 9-20% depending on the year). Anything STEM-related, you are looking at 10-25% acceptance rate. If you are looking at something humanities-related, you are looking at ~90% acceptance rates. If you get accepted to UIUC, you have to apply to your desired major with those acceptance rates. The 65% is basically an average.\n\nSo, like you said, those numbers depending on the context can be disguised, but potentially in *completely* different ways. BYU isn't terribly hard to get into *overall* but I'd expect a few programs to be harder to get into, and many others slightly easier. UIUC on the other hand is polarizingly different.\n\nSource: BYU alum, but lived in Urbana, did STEM research at UIUC, asked professors and friends.",

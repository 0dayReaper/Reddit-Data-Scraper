You can contact international student office at BYU and see if they can help connect you with scholarships available specifically to students from Brazil.  \n\nUnlike other universities in USA,  BYU requires US $4000 deposit which is not covered by scholarship. https://enrollment.byu.edu/international-student-deposit\n\nAlso keep in mind, if you intend to work in the US after your education, a degree from Music College will not help. You have to get a degree in STEM major to get a work visa. Of course there are ways around it - 1) marry a US citizen while at BYU 2) apply for asylum of sorts 3) green card lottery. :)",

You are at immense disadvantage compared to US citizens when it comes to jobs in US even during the summer break. And BYU does not have a large international student population compared to other universities, so you may feel isolated when you see your peers who are US citizens getting jobs easy and telling you \"why can't you find a job just like us\". Many of them don't know the challenges of International students in the US in terms of jobs, visas etc.",

Go to the nearest US consulate office and ask them if they have a University section there. If you are LDS, ask anyone with American contacts to connect with you people who have navigated the work visa process in US. \n\nHere are some web searches that you can do on your own. \n-&gt; Companies that sponsor H1B visa. \n-&gt; Companies that hire interns who are international students. OPT visa. \n\nAnd if you eventual goal is to leave Brazil and immigrate to a first world country, I would recommend looking at Canada which offers a much easier route to legal immigration than US.",

However, I also have some dear friends in the administration of the religion department at BYU (which is the department that, let\u2019s be honest, really struggles with this sometimes) and I just wish everyone knew how hard they are trying to change things and be better. Some older professors are pushing back on these types of trainings, but I promise that a LOT of the other professors are trying to shift their mindset and biases to be more inclusive, understanding, and loving. There were several LGBTQ students that attended church history tours this summer, and that was truly an empathy-building experience for the professors. I\u2019ve seen firsthand how much they really want to be better, and it can be really discouraging when they are trying to improve and all they hear is, \u201cyou guys will never change! You\u2019re so homophobic!\u201d So please extend grace, be encouraging, and have conversations that can help others create change! \u2764\ufe0f",

To some that could constitute sexually attraction to one\u2019s own sex, whereas to others the term requires the additional caveat of engaging in gay sex. \n\nIf the definition you use is the former, then *being* gay is neither here nor there in terms of the Honor Code. In the abstract, many eccentric desires are y scrutinized by the Honor Code - sexual and nonsexual alike. \n\nIf your definition is the latter, however, then such actions would be violative of one\u2019s contractural obligations with the university, regardless of religious affiliation. \n\nIn my estimation, the reason BYU allows adherents of other religions to attend, regardless of their personal beliefs in the divinity of Jesus Christ, is that enrollment of such students provides them with an opportunity of accepting the Restored Gospel. \n\nBy the same token, and for their continued attendance at the university, it is incumbent upon those who have already entered into the Covenant of Baptism to keep the faith. \n\nPeople frequently gripe about the fact that (for example) a Muslim student, who never converts to Christianity and the Restored Gospel, can happily attend the university for four years, obtain his degree, and be on his merry way without ever accepting the divinity of Jesus Christ, whereas a covenanted Latter-day Saint risks expulsion from the university if he chooses to leave the Church. \n\nIn this matter, the different consequences for the two hypothetical students are a result of the different covenants and obligations to which the students have entered into. \n\nFor the Muslim student, disbelief in the divinity of Jesus Christ and no formal affiliation with His Church is that student\u2019s default status upon admission to the university. For the purposes of the university, any deviation from that status quo would only constitute a move in the positive direction (i.e. conversion to Christianity and to the Restored Gospel). Consequently, given that a deviation from the status quo would fulfill one of the purposes of his admission to the university, such a student would in no way be penalized. \n\nFor the already baptized Latter-day Saint, however, the status quo is a preexisting conversion to the Restored Gospel. For the purposes of the university, any deviation from that status quo would only constitute a move in the negative direction (i.e. leaving the Church). Consequently, given that such a move would go contrary to the purposes of a Latter-day Saint\u2019s admission, the university has a motive to discontinue such a student\u2019s enrollment. \n\nThus, saying that the university doesn\u2019t care about one\u2019s belief in Christ is inaccurate, as it does not account for the differences in status quo ante among the student body.",

That is a major part of being gay. \n\nIt seems we\u2019re in agreement that, each of the various definitions of the term *being* gay involves attraction to one\u2019s own sex. Perhaps our difference in definition is only a difference in degree - that the ancillary romantic pursuits of one\u2019s own sex need not rise to the level of intercourse itself, but can constitute lesser emotional and physical involvement. \n\n&gt;To forbid that is like telling a Mormon \u201cyou can be Mormon, but you just can\u2019t DO anything Mormon. Just keep it to yourself.\u201d\n\nHence the dilema in defining an immutable identity on the basis of freely willed actions.\n\nA more apt analogy would postulate an identity that is benign, per se, composed of a core element of praxis that violates the contractual obligations of the Honor Code and the dogma of the Church. \n\nSuppose that coffee enthusiasts felt compelled to identify themselves as being immutably inclined to the consumption of the beverage. \n\nIf such a person were to attend BYU, he would be under the same obligations as any other student to abstain from coffee for the duration of their study at the university. That hypothetical student\u2019s consumption of coffee prior to and following his enrollment at BYU would fall outside of the jurisdiction of the contractural obligations within the Honor Code. \n\n&gt;And why can\u2019t \u201cmoving in the right direction\u201d be used for gay people?\n\nIt certainly can. Inasmuch as \u201cmoving in the right direction\u201d constitutes the progression from the status quo ante onto or along the Covenant Path, all are free to do so. \n\n&gt;Like a gay pastor friend of mine. He wouldn\u2019t be allowed to join, despite having all the same qualifications as a Muslim.\n\nIf by *join* you mean to be enrolled at the university, then it depends, once again, on the definition of *being* gay. If the modifier is used to connote exclusively the pastor friend\u2019s sexual attraction, then he would indeed be on the same footing as the Muslim student (i.e. a non-Latter-day Saint applicant). \n\nIf, however, the modifier is used to additionally connote freely willed praxis, then the pastor friend would need to abstain from such behavior for the duration of his study at the university in order to remain in compliance with the conditions of admission.",

If it was going to change you think you would get hints, instead of modern apostles digging in deeper (such as Christensen saying the law of chastity will never change).\n\nIf it happens I\u2019ll accept it, but I see no such indications it ever will apart from the desires of some members not in policy making positions.",

Originally, Apostles and Prophets were not capitalized, and given that Joseph Smith said this 5 years before the Quorum of the 12 was even organized, does not refer to the presiding bodies of the church. Rather it refers much more broadly to priesthood holders (and we can reasonably infer their wives as well, since the basic unit of the church is the family and not the man alone). So yes, the fundamental principle of the church is indeed Faith in Jesus Christ by its members.\n\nBut why did Jesus do what he did? Who sent him, and for what purpose?

Sometimes things are unchangeable, sometimes their foundational, etc. it\u2019s a semantic game that doesn\u2019t actually benefit anyone, just allows us to wiggle out of the important questions. \n\nNow, your question, why did Jesus do what he did?

John 3:16 tells us it was so that we might not perish but have eternal life. \n\nBut I\u2019ve shared direct quotes from scriptures and prophets.

Elder Holland has spoken at least once on the difference between the currently more common Apostle vs the lower case apostle, as they are two different things. I went into that detail to show that Joseph Smith was talking about faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nDoctrines and principles are sometimes difficult to distinguish with blurred lines between them it\u2019s true, but in general a principle is something we do while a doctrine is something we know. God\u2019s identity is clearly a doctrine while faith is clearly a principle, but if you ask me which the Law of Chastity is then the answer is sort of both. Point being, saying that something can\u2019t be the fundamental doctrine of the gospel because a prophet stated something else was the fundamental principle of the gospel doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nIt\u2019s a somewhat crude way of putting it, but yes, Christ came so that people could be married forever and pop out infinite spirit babies. I leave straight out because non heterosexual marriage is an oxymoron; marriage is between a man and a woman and anything else simply doesn\u2019t fit the gospel definition. \n\nBoth John 3:16 and that scripture in Moses state that this is the reason that Christ came. He came so that we could have Eternal Life. Eternal Life has a specific meaning in the gospel, distinct from immortality. It does NOT mean living forever like immortality does. Eternal Life means exaltation as eternal families, so again, despite my finding what you said a crude way of putting it, it is actually accurate.

If the church loses members who are too bigoted to accept gay and lesbian brothers and sisters we should not allow that to prevent us from following the second greatest commandment to love others.

I think it's fair to follow modern prophets in that regard.  I also think the earliest pattern of man and woman is marriage and togetherness, not celibacy.    \n\n\nYou can disagree with someone and not call them a heretic.  There's also a distinction between what a person says as their own opinion and when they are acting in the office of prophet or apostle. I think BY said \"A prophet is only a prophet when he is acting as such.\"  \n\n\nIt's more like different rules for different people at different times.  Jews had their OT law Christians have NT law.  Latter-day Saints have latter day law.  The church won't lose members, they'll retain their faith but there will be a division unlike we've seen before.    \n\n\nA commandment is to love, but there are other commandments to follow as well.  We can't just excuse everything under the banner of the great commandment.  We are covenanted to God, and the proclamation to the world is a position statement on where we sit on gender, family and marriage.  It came at a time well before LGBTQ was even on the publics radar.  There's wisdom in it, and I hope it isn't budged by a small number of activists.",

If the church is simply a bunch of old men doing their best to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ as recorded in the scriptures, then the doctrine on LGBTQ probably will change eventually (even if it takes 100 years).  This seems to be the view of nearly everyone who is pushing the church for changes in LGBTQ teachings.\n\nHowever, if the church is actually led by God who gives leaders revelation when they, and the church, are ready to receive it, then it's highly unlikely that a doctrine as fundamental to the LDS church as Eternal Marriage and the Law of Chastity will change. Previous doctrinal changes have largely focused on doctrine that isn't nearly as fundamental.\n\nNow obviously, there is definitely improvements to be made with how church members, and to some extent, the church itself, treats members who identify as LBGTQ. However, I agree with OP that even if every person in the church shows perfect kindness and compassion to those in the LGBTQ community, it will never be enough without a complete reversal on doctrine.",

    "postText": "Hello guys! I'm a BYU student about to enter my Junior year and I could really use some advice on which path I should take in tech. I want to be able to be a software engineer and then go into tech management ultimately. I've already been admitted to the Information Systems major but I don't officially start until September so I can change it.\n\nThe two paths:\n\n1:\n- BS: Information Systems\n- MS: Information Systems Management\n- Enter the workforce\n\n2:\nMinor: Business\n- BS: Computer Science\n- Enter workforce\n- Return to school and get an MBA\n- Re-enter workforce\n\nThanks in advance!!!",

            "comment": "I'm a CS major but would actually advise you to continue on your current with the IS program. I know several former BYU students who got IS degrees and have been able to get SWE jobs pretty easily. BYU has a great IS program, and especially since you want to get into management, IS is a really good mixture of both the technical and business sides of tech. I'm a software engineer working for one very large SaaS company this summer, and I've met a large number of software engineers at my company that don't have CS degrees (or even any degree, for that matter).",

Otherwise, it's hard to argue against an IS degree as BYU's program is top notch and the degree is more flexible allowing you to pivot more easily as you advance in your career.",

CS majors will probably have a slight advantage to actual programming out of their undergrads but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s something you can\u2019t learn and be just as good or better at. \n\nThe term \u201csoftware engineer\u201d is fairly broad and there are no shortage of jobs available all across Utah and the US. If you can solve problems programmatically and demonstrate that, you\u2019ll be fine. \n\nIm very glad I went the \u201cengineering\u201d undergrad route and then a more business focused masters starting here in a few weeks.\n\nIf you stick around in the IS program, ill probably see you around at some point! I feel like an outlier coming into the program that seems to be a mostly integrated program with &gt;90% of students going right from IS into the MISM program. So we\u2019ll see how that goes\u2026",

I would however join the competitive programming club to sharpen your coding skills and prepare for technical interviews. Perhaps a minor in CS would also be beneficial since you\u2019ll learn more about software engineering and algorithms at the end of the minor.",

Keep in mind though, you would need some mastery of software or technology before you get into tech management. While management is all about navigating work politics and power hierarchy, you will get eaten up if you can't talk shop. \nFor what its worth, your degree will not matter much. You can major in History, but if your work experience shows managing tech products or engineers you will do fine. MBA may be unnecessary these days as it you can get that experience on the job. \n\nIt also helps to have you personal life sorted out in some fashion too. Because you can easily burn out if you take on a lot at an aggressive schedule. \n\nGet a therapist who can coach you and keep you aligned on your goals. \n\nGood luck!",

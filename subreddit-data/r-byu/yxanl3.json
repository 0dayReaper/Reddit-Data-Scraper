Do an on campus internship, find something related to marketing at a club on campus, or find a job off campus. \n\nYou should also do relatively well in the prerequisites, attend marketing association events, and try to meet professors and current marketing students.",

But in all seriousness do more research than a simple google search before you put people down and shame them for their career choices. The reason behind the low salary is that ~30% of grads from the marketing program go into sales. The average base salary for a first year SDR is $56,000, but with commission they make around $90k. The program also has a large number of students who choose to remain in Utah, which has jobs with below average starting salaries. \n\nThis thread was created asking for help, and your snarky comment was not needed. Let people study what they want, what interests them has nothing to do with you or your opinion.",

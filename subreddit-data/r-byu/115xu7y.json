Enjoy!\n\nThe tithing subsidies equates to:\n\n* 78% tuition scholarship for BYU Provo\n* 92% for BYU Hawaii\n* 31% for BYU Idaho\n* 61% for Ensign College\n\nNote: the data is based on audited financials, available online here:\n\n[https://facdissem.census.gov/Main.aspx](https://facdissem.census.gov/Main.aspx)   (search by school name in the \"auditee\" field)\n\nWe estimate the BYU system subsidy is \\~19% of the Church\u2019s entire annual cash budget.\n\nThis is a huge financial investment w/ likely strong returns in the form of a generation of long-term tithe payers.",

Part of the reason why I transferred out of there tbh just felt like I was being inauthentic going there and was holding a spot there that would likely be a spot for someone who\u2019s more active and actually pays tithing.",

Applying this to BYU means that the Widow's mite is being spent on people who are better off. If the church doesn't earn a return on the BYU subsidy, it is using tithing funds to make help those who are better off rather then those in need.\n\nMilton Friedman discussion:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3-_r_t7AZU\n\nIf the church makes a return on this investment, it is no longer a \"welfare\" benefit to people who are better off but an investment in future tithing revenues.\n\nI would think that from a believer perspective, getting a return on the funds would be the preferable outcome from an optics point of view rather than it being a middle class subsidy.",

If half of those stay in the church as full tithe payers, that\u2019s $21 million per graduating class per year in tithing. \n\nNo one\u2019s made a comment as to whether this is good or bad, or whether that is the motive behind the church\u2019s investment in BYU. However, it does seem hard to argue that this investment doesn\u2019t yield strong net positive financial results.",

Please take a look at our [synopsis](http://widowsmitereport.wordpress.com/taxquestions) of the recent heated media coverage over taxes and tithing in Canada and Australia. In their accusations, none of the media bothered to actually go through the numbers in context. And we show correctly how to track the use of some Canadian tithing to BYU is both perfectly legitimate and reasonable. Australia is more complex on the other hand, and it may end up the Church has to change something. There, we have tracked the numbers in context and show that complexity as it is currently understood. So you could look at that small microcosm of our effort and call it +1 and -1 if you\u2019re so inclined to keep score.",

You\u2019re assuming that all exmormons have no interest in unbiased information about the church, and only want things painted in a negative light? I\u2019ll counter that and say that there are many ex-members that are interested in the doings of the church, positive or negative, because they dedicated so much of their life to it. Especially if they are in Utah and the dealings of the church still impact their life, whether that be in politics or socially.\n\nI haven\u2019t read the OP\u2019s comment history, I don\u2019t really have time for that and I don\u2019t think that at all impacts the objectivity of the information provided (seeing as no claims about church motives are made). However just glancing at their post history, it seems most of their posts are various reports on Church finances. If posting at all in the exmormon sub(a sub definitely interested in topics such as these) is your baseline qualification for being a bad-actor, you\u2019re going to be dismissing a lot of information without bias",

And many of those changes including coming to terms with your sexuality which you are born with. If it were a choice, it would be easy to follow the gospel which many want to when they enroll at BYU. \nThe challenge here is that BYU being special as it is builds a Stockholm syndrome type situation, since you can't just transfer off to another schools easily for various reason. \nAnd to this thread you notice that the brethren are happy to subsidize tuition at BYU but loath paying more taxes to subsidize tuition at U/USU/UVU.",

The investment in BYU is made to balance the university budget while keeping tuition rates very low, well below market rate. Economists would say BYU tuition is artificially low.",

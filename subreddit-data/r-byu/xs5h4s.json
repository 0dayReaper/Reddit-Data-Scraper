    "postText": "Okay, here\u2019s an idea. Club cheerleading at BYU. Think about it, there is a club/intramural team for just about every sport that people may have done in high school, but what about the cheerleaders? After high school, if they don\u2019t have the skills/time/experience required for the BYU cheer team, then that\u2019s it\u2014there is no other option for them, their time enjoying their sport is just\u2026over. Those who couldn\u2019t be on the BYU soccer team? They can just get a bunch of buddies together and play a game, but cheerleaders\u2014you need an organized team for that. If there were a BYU intramural team, they could cheer at the other sport\u2019s games. \n\nAlso, this team wouldn\u2019t just be for those who did cheer in high school or middle school, this team would give those who never got the chance to try out cheer to give it a shot. Those who regret never giving it a chance don\u2019t have any options for them to try it out in provo, I\u2019d know, I\u2019ve looked into it myself.\n\nHaving a club/intramural cheer team would be a fun and safe space for those who want to continue their cheer experience or to try it out for the first time. I believe there would definitely be enough interested people to have a full team, so why not?\n\ntldr;\nIs there any interest being a part of a cheerleading club / inter-mural team for people that either have experience or desire to cheer but can\u2019t anymore because they aren\u2019t part of an organization?",

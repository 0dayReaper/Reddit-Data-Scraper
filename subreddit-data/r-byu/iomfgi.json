            "comment": "Real talk...\n\nZach Wilson is overrated. He had a \u201cmeh\u201d game against a very mediocre defense. Romney is the better quarterback, hands down. They played much better last year when he was the starter.\n\nThey played a Navy team that hasn\u2019t even had a full contact practice.\n\nOffensive line looked good, but again, against a very mediocre team.\n\nThe receivers are useless. Lost track of how many drops from catchable balls there were. Too much focus on defensive recruiting that they\u2019ve lost a lot of talented players to transfers because of lack of playing time. The loss of Bushman is also huge. I won\u2019t be surprised if we see the running backs get more receiving yards than the receivers this year.\n\nDefense looks solid. Higher hopes for this group this year.\n\nIndependence will kick them in the butt. Since the NCAA is not awarding a national championship this year, all the other teams have to play for is the conference championship. BYU doesn\u2019t have one. The players have essentially nothing to play for other than some pride or increased draft stock (if any are even considered).\n\nAs a side, can we address the blatant Honor Code violations? So much long hair, beards, etc. It\u2019s a dumb rule, but BYU would solve a lot of their issues if they were just consistent with everyone.",

                    "comment": "This is such a cold take. Zach was 75% last year even before his season ending injury. His shoulder issues are all healed now. He has looked fantastic in several games in his career, and pretty bad in others. We\u2019ve also had a young O line and RB corps that made his life hard. Injuries and lacking position groups have made him look inconsistent. There\u2019s also a reason you don\u2019t typically start young QBs like he had to. Don\u2019t even get me started on the inexperienced coaching we\u2019ve had since his start. \n\nBaylor looked good against Boise State, but Zach has looked good against teams that were just as good (and much better). Personally, I\u2019m trusting the coaches that see them every practice on this one. \n\nAnd you may be the only person that would complain about the receivers in a game where we had 5 receivers catch a pass of at least 15 yards, averaging 17.4 per reception.",

    "postText": "I usually try and study late at night for my classes, and it's hard to do so in my room at Helaman because my roommate is a light sleeper and goes to bed early. I try and study in the library and the Wilk because they are open until Midnight. However, I was wondering if there are any other buildings or places on campus (or off campus) that are good places to study and open past 12?",

There is a large stepdown louge on the ground floor. Btw, only full time officers can make you leave the building, not student officers. If you get a Caedm account, you can get access to the caedm computer labs and it's pretty regular for people to be working late in there. You can also try to use the mezzanine in your building, when I stayed in helaman it was usually quiet.",

You can stay late as you want in these labs as long as you don't try to re-enter.  Spent many a nights up till 2-3am during my Senior year but I took 15 and then 16 credit hours my last 2 semesters to graduate.",

There's also the weird room every Helaman building has on their second floor that has a printer, and I believe the Cannon Center has study rooms you can reserve that late as well.",

The main lounges were always empty by 1am (except on the weekends). Plus, being close to home means you can study longer ;)",

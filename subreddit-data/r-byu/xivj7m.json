    "postText": "Hello, I am an Oregon Duck Law student and I was at the game in the student section. I heard the \"Fuck the Mormons\" but since seemingly hundreds of people were participating I assumed that I couldn't do anything about it and just refused to participate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was disgusted though, and I want to apologize from the bottom of my heart for that garbage. It was cruel, out of bounds, and inexcusable. I am sorry that I stood idly while kids chanted, and I want you to know that most Oregonians, including the stereotypical liberal Oregonians, were disgusted by this and would apologize to you too. I have *tremendous* respect for how the Cougars carried themselves, and I deeply appreciate the Oregon flag and the Spencer Webb-honoring flag y'all carried. I will root for you the rest of the season and likely after that.",

I like to think of other people pretty similarly, and I prefer to keep an open mind, give people grace, and not assume what how person may believe or act before I see it for myself. It's really nice to see comments on Reddit that really resonate with my values. \n\nI know how intimidating it can be to stand alone, and I don't think anyone rational would blame you for not taking action in those moments. It shows a lot about your character to see that you're trying to take time to have empathy &amp; understanding of other people, and you're willing to take your own time to try to mend bridges. Thank you!",

We know there were many there that did not condone the action of a very vocal bunch of students. \n\nThe \"Mormons\" as a whole have dealt with persecution since the restoration of the church.

Unfortunately, it is not.\n\nIt has blood on its hands.  From its inception all the way up to 2022.  All the general authorities are stained by it.  Many in local leadership are stained by it.\n\nA few recent examples:\n-Homophobic/transphobic rhetoric and policies.  For an institution centered in Utah,  where the leading cause of death for individuals ages 10-24 is suicide and knowing that LGBTQIA+ teens are especially vulnerable,  this isn't just tone-deaf.  It's malicious and violent.\n-Child sex abuse cover-ups.\n-Hoarding $100billion+ of funds marked for charitable use that could be used to save or radically improve the lives of so many of the hungry or homeless, or sick.\n\nThere are a lot of run-of-the-mill Mormons who treat others with more dignity than their \"church\" does.  Unfortunately,  many of these same individuals also idolize their leaders while ignoring their immoral behaviors and contribute monetarily to the institution, perpetuating the harm.\n\nSo... it is my opinion that \"f*** the Mormons\" was 100% fair play.",

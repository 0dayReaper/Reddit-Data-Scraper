I remember having people come to classes to talk about how cool they are, offer scholarships, etc. I went on one, and it really was amazing, but people just don't want to do them or can't afford them that often.\n\nMeanwhile others like the Jerusalem center have hordes applying. \n\nIt just depends. 10/10 would recommend though, it's worth applying even if you don't get it. There are tons available so you're guaranteed to get something if you really want to.\n\nhttps://kennedy.byu.edu/isp-program/japan is highly recommended. Also if they ever bring back the China study abroads as well, I've heard are amazing.",

I speak from interacting with many of my fellow engineering students) from an engineering program have usually taken a full load Spring and Summer every year. Most of us take 5 years now and take Spring/Summer off to work/intern. Doing a study abroad is very low on the priority list for a number of us.",

Many engineering students take study abroads and still graduate in 4 years, with summer internships.\n\nI did. I also worked 20 hours a week my entire time at BYU. You're forgetting that many study abroads are classes, many of which count towards your generals. Very possible if taken your freshman or sophomore years.\n\nIt's absolutely feasible for most engineering students.",

I would imagine that there are very good legal reasons for BYU to not discriminate on the basis of gender, not to mention moral reasons (which doesn't prohibit them from recruiting males). But it's true that most study abroad programs have far more female participants. Long story short, if I were OP I wouldn't worry about denied admittance to a program because of gender.",

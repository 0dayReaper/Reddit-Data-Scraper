            "comment": "The formal textbook or the collection of readings? You won't be able to find the readings together like that online, they're compiled by each individual professor each semester, and BYU charges for them to cover copyright. If you want to find each reading yourself, you can, but they're also sometimes abridged by the professor specifically according to what they want to focus on. It's definitely easier to just spend the $40 or however much it is. \n\nIf you need it, though, copies of the textbook and the collected readings are available in the American Heritage lab in the library, so you can definitely make it through the semester without purchasing them as long as you don't mind reading on site.",

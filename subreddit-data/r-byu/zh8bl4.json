    "postText": "Looking for a little bit of guidance here while having a panic attack in the library, haha. My housing options for next semester have all fallen through and I have nowhere to live come January (or family nearby). \n\nThe biggest issue finding a contract is finding something that ends in April. Everything seems to end in August, but I plan on attending a study abroad. I don't want to take the risk of trying to sell the spring/summer portion of a contract. I'm part of all the Facebook groups, but I've had no luck.\n\nWhat complexes in the area offer contracts that end in April? I would love help compiling a list so I know where to look and ask! ",

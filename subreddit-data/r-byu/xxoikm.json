    "postText": "I'm currently pondering the option of taking Spanish classes at BYU as a non-Spanish-speaking RM. I'm a teaching major and feel like learning basic Spanish would be pretty useful down the road. I don't have my GE Lang. of Learning yet and realize that in order to fulfill that req. with Spanish would mean me taking quite a few classes. \n\nIf I take SPAN 101, 102 and then 105, 106, and eventually 205 to get the GE is it worth it? Like will I have learned enough Spanish to actually be able to use it as a teacher with some of my students who don't speak English as their first language? I'm thinking of doing the term accelerated SPAN 101, 102 track as well. Are those accelerated classes too much work? \n\nThanks for the help!",

If you took 2 years, it\u2019s recommended to start with 105. 205 gets you to an intermediate high level, which is basically defined as being able to talk about the things you encounter in regular life and creating with the language",

Also, that's a ton of classes to take for one GE... I'd say it's not worth it, and not worth the high stress in BYU's language classes.\n\nIf we're being honest, BYU's language classes are built to give RM's credit for their mission language and not to teach the language. Some people might disagree with me, those who are really good with languages, people in super easy majors where language classes are the only hard classes they have to take, or people who are just super school savvy could probably make these classes work. I'm not one of these so I might just be biased.... but yeah. Something to consider I guess. Make sure to look at the RateMyProfessor stuff.",

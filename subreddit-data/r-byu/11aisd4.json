    "postText": "So I think this will be a long shot but I found a iphone buried in a planter box in the JFSB. It was dead. When I charged it, the date showed as November 1. It has a sim card in it but isn't connecting to a network and won't update. And it needs a passcode to do anything. Just taking a shot if any one happens to be missing one or might know who it could belong to before I turn it over to the lost and found.",

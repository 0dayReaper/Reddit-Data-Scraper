Does that mean I won\u2019t get a scholarship sophomore year or just means I have to keep a decent gpa?\nAlso, it lists the scholarship as Brigham young. Does anyone know what scholarship this is?",

You have to reapply for scholarships each year to continue to receive scholarships. Maintaining a good gpa is definitely good for scholarships and regardless, but most important is that you reapply each school year. It could be need-based, which you would still need to reapply for but you would likely still qualify for need based even if you don\u2019t have a \u201chigh\u201d gpa (as long as you are still in good academic standing/whatever the specific scholarship qualifications are). Call enrollment services, they can probably give you more specific info!",

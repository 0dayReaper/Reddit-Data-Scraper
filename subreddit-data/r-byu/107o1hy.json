You needed to read like 3 novels through the semester but I used audio book so that was pretty easy. He is a super thoughtful guy, and offers really cool and valid perspective on things",

            "comment": "Depends on the professor, but generally be prepared for many essays. I had Prof. Isom-Verhaaren who approached from a very feminist angle, which was unique to history classes because we ended up examining a lot of primary sources that would probably not show up in a typical history class. That being said the exams were very essay heavy and done in blue book, which was a huge pain in the butt. Plus a huge binder of papers we had to read from as our text book basically.\n\nOverall, the class isn't really that hard. It's general history. I doubt Kerry would do much to make it extremely different from the class I had. Just do the readings and regurgitate the politics/opinions of the professor and the points they make in class about the sources and you'll do fine.",

I wish efforts could be focused on making sure the youth\u2019s program is effective and efficient first. \n\nI don\u2019t think I could ever attend this without feeling treated like a child. Some sort of YSA excursion might be fun to some people, but I feel like this doesn\u2019t really meet the needs of the YSA. \n\nFSY is already a horny enough atmosphere with staff as is. The sexual repression is going to be palpable in Nauvoo that week! \ud83d\ude2c",

                            "comment": "austinchan2 really hit it on the head! Scheduling was all last minute, every week felt severely understaffed, and travel was inconsistent. Training felt like a big fluff piece to get everyone excited and prepare for spiritual experiences, which in of itself is not bad, but we definitely needed some more training with logistics and real world issues. \n\nWorking as a coordinator, I always felt drained. It was hard to have any sort of spiritual experience because you\u2019re occupied dealing with the host campus, angry parents, and youth that are in trouble. \n\nExamples: The campus would be angry about noise levels or a youth who broke something, parents would be upset that their youth weren\u2019t allowed to just go to bed at 6 everyday, and youth would be fighting or confessing suicide attempts or that they\u2019d been raped at home. \n\nI slept on average 3 hours a night all summer, including weekends. I don\u2019t regret the job, since I feel like as a team we were able to touch the lives of so many youth (and also be the first in many situations to report and get the ball rolling on investigating abusive situations at home). \n\nI\u2019m not opposed to the program itself! I remember my EFY experience from 2016 and treasure it. It was instrumental in me deciding to go on a mission. I think the other guy said it well: too much energy and effort had to be spend on covering up a train wreck behind the curtain.",

Everything is going poorly, from the technology side to the scheduling to transportation to training. Honestly every counselor that has worked it knows that 50% of your effort is making it a great week for the youth and the other 50% is hiding and compensating for the mismanagement so the youth don\u2019t see what a train wreck it is behind the curtain.",

There are also those who go on one date a month, and usually they're the one asking (I fell into the latter category). And there are those who go often enough but not a ton. The prolific daters stand out more, but they're not the majority.",

I suspect few women are going on dozens of dates a week, but recognize that it can feel overwhelming. It is absolutely a culture thing. The solution is probably to ask out lots of women. Plan inexpensive, fun dates like hikes, frisbee golf, game nights, cooking together, etc. And not everyone will say yes, but that is okay.",

            "comment": "I was a \"heavy dater\" my freshman year. I was one of 3-5 girls in several of my math classes, and played a lot of Dungeons and Dragons/other tabletop games. The result was I met a lot of guys, went on a lot of first dates. I dated more guys than any of the girls I knew, and had a reputation in the ward for having the most dates.\n\nI say this not as a brag (I was NOT a catch; I was a very weird little kid freshman year) but to point out how inaccurate the word \"dozens\" is lol. I went on 1-4 dates a week, on average. That, in my ward at least, was considered \"lots of dating.\" And seven years later, I would STILL consider that to be a heck of a lot of dating; I do NOT have time for that any more lol. I certainly wasn't seeing \"dozens of different guys.\" I don't think ANYONE is seeing that many people. \n\nAlso, it's worth noting that while I was a freshman, the guys I dated ranged in age from 18-30. I did not realize quite how creepy this was at the time. (Like I knew it was creepy, but hadn't put the age gap into perspective.) As I got older, my dates decreased. There really is something about the young freshman girls getting targeted by a lot of scary guys that increases their dating numbers. \n\nIf you're a guy dating girls and want to know how to stand out, my suggestions are honestly \"date within your age range and also be genuinely nice, not fake nice.\" There's a lot of competition to hunt the poor eighteen year old freshman girls. Date the older ones. And treat them with respect. You'd be surprised how rare it feels to be treated like a human, not a prize.",

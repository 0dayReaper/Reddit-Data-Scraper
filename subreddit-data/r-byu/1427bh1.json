I'm doing a double major, so I've had to take 18 credits pretty much every semester to ensure I graduate on time. My grades have been pretty good until this past semester. I was working 15 hours a week, getting engaged, and taking 18 credits of some really hard classes. I ended up failing two of them. So definitely try to get a feel for your classes and how you handle pressure before doing a ton of credits.",

Econ 110, ECEN 301, and CCE 203 are all very hard classes, and your life will be hell doing them all. Be prepared to spend most of you free time either in class, studying, or in the TA labs.\n3. TechComm was pretty boring for me, but it is gonna be required for pretty much any stem/tech major, so get it done while you still have your High School writing skills.\n4.

You can always do a spring/summer to get some credits - school is chill during these terms.\n\nA standard freshman question to ask each other is, \"How many credits are you taking?\" Freshman students think it's a badge of intelligence to have a heavy load for their first semester at school. Ignore this. After the first two weeks, no one will ever ask you. \n\nUniversity is much more difficult than high school and almost everyone is very smart. It's also far less structured since no one cares whether you attend classes or turn assignments in. You'll be stretching your wings on your new independent life and will be staying up late. \n\nGood luck. The next four years are probably the most important of your life. You'll set yourself up for a career path and you may even find your spouse (if that's a life goal for you).",

Doesn't matter if the professor (who I personally really like) is excellent, you WILL have a hard time in that class.\n\nCS 110 is a huge time commitment too. ECON 110 isn't necessarily hard, but can be a time commitment. EC EN classes tend to be hard. I didn't take one, but did hear a lot about them. \n\nBasically, you're taking the \"weeder\" classes for 3 different majors. Don't expect this to be a fun semester in the slightest. I won't say it's not doable, but if you're a freshman, you should be enjoying the social atmosphere, going to events, and enjoying your nights. I look back at freshman year fondly because I had a large friend group, did fun things often (camping, hiking, video games), and had very high grades. This was because I did 13 credits each of those first 2 semesters.",

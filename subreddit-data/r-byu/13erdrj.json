You can get on the BYU public wifi from most rooms, and someone in your appartment will need to bring a router. I had my setup there and the desks only have space for a single monitor if they are bigger than 21\".",

But yes at least one Ethernet port in your apartment will be active so you will need to bring your own router. I believe they need it to be a router only, not a router/modem combo unit. If there is ever an issue with the internet, make sure you have the capability to hard wire your computer to the Ethernet port to troubleshoot as OIT won\u2019t do anything if you cannot 100% confirm the issue is with the port and not the router.",

            "comment": "&gt; Do I need to bring something\n\nBring a router, a short ethernet cable (wall to router), and a long ethernet cable if you want to use wired internet in another room\n\n&gt; How does the WiFi thing work in general\n\nYour router plugs into the wall and gives you WiFi. The communal areas on each floor also have WiFi connections (probably eduroam, but I haven't been there in years).\n\n&gt; Will I have access to connect to Ethernet\n\nYes. Technically you could just plug your computer directly into the wall and get ethernet, but if you want WiFi then bring a router and plug your computer in to that.",

Everyone on campus is probably listening to their own unique mix of music 6 days a week, which is very diverse, but one day a week a large portion of our campus community is probably listening to hymns and church songs. That's the one genre that most of us have in common, so I bet that's why the algorithm singled that out as the one commonality",

It's not a list of popular songs, just ones that you aren't likely to hear elsewhere. Otherwise every American university playlist would be almost the same. I skimmed through BYU's and yeah, doesn't seem like there are many other kinds of unique songs collectively listened to.",

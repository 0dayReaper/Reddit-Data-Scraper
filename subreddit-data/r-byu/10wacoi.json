    "postText": "Hey, guys! \n\nI'm in the last year of high school and everybody is already deciding and pondering about their future including myself. I want to go to college and I've searching some schools. And one of the options is BYU.\n\nI'm not a member of the church. But I go sometimes, I have friends and I feel immerse in the lds culture. And there are times that some members mention  this school. \n\nWhat you guys can tell me about the school and its environment? Do you have to be a really faithful member? I have to talk with a bishop? I never did seminary, that is something that I have to worry about? Outside of Utah, this college is respected? (in terms of getting a job)\n\nI'm asking here because I assume that some of the members studied or are currently studying there\n\nPs: I'm not american and I'm not living there so I'll be a foreign student and sorry for my english, its not my first language",

            "comment": "&gt;  Do you have to be a really faithful member? \n\nYou do have to follow the Honor Code while you are a student. That does exclude things like sex outside of marriage, alcohol, coffee, and other standards that wouldn't exist at some other school. \n\nYou do NOT have to have to be a member of the church or say you believe in the church to attend. Google says about 1% of BYU undergrads are not members of the church. I think a lot of this 1% is international students. \n\n&gt; I have to talk with a bishop?\n\nIf you are not a member you should be able to meet with your own religious leader. Eg. a local priest, if you're Catholic. You said that you go to church sometimes, so the bishop of that church could also be the person you talk with. I believe the conversation is basically to confirm that you understand and will follow the Honor Code rules.\n\n&gt; I never did seminary, that is something that I have to worry about?\n\nIf you're not a member, then no. Shouldn't be a problem.\n\n&gt; Outside of Utah, this college is respected?\n\nPretty well respected, in most locations, in most fields. It is relatively well known throughout the US, and there are BYU graduates throughout the country. I would say it has a wider network than a lot of US State schools. It definately has the strongest clout within Utah/Idaho/Nevada/Arizona though. \n\nReally though, you only depend on your college to land the first job. After that it depends more on how you did at your previous job and your own network.\n\nI moved to Minnesota after graduating and was able to get a job there pretty easily. Grad school accepted my BYU undergrad without any problems. \n\n\nOther note: \n\nIf you graduate from BYU then people you talk with may assume that you're a member of the church, both while you're at BYU and during your career. That probably won't be a problem, but might be something you end up having to discuss from time to time.",

You *will* have to agree to live by the Honor Code and thus be expected to live by some of the more outward tenets of the faith (no coffee, tea, or alcohol, strict sexual abstinence outside of marriage, etc.) and the dress and grooming standards, and you will have to get an ecclesiastical endorsement (the first half can be from either your own religious leader or a local bishop or mission president). You will also still be required to take LDS religion courses.\n\nCulturally, you might find some quirks. Because BYU is mostly members, people will automatically assume you *are* a member of the Church. Also, many students are slightly older due to missionary service prior or during attendance. There's also a strong culture of dating and marriage; if that's something you're interested in (you absolutely don't have to be; I graduated very single), you may find it more difficult, as most students are hoping to date someone they can marry in the temple (i.e., another member).\n\nAs far as education is concerned, BYU is well respected. I grew up in Texas, and my wards were chock-full of people who graduated from BYU and were working good, solid jobs. I have tons of friends who have gotten good jobs right after graduation that take them out of Utah, and equally many who got into amazing graduate programs (in fact, BYU is #5 in the US for students who go on to get PhDs).",

If you join the church temporarily for during your time at BYU, then the tuition costs are some of the lowest in US and probably lower than some other countries too. Tuition cost is double if you you not LDS, and there is not much value in that. You might choose another university in US better suited for the money and better value.\n\n2. Excellent alumni network, although it is biased toward those who are LDS and your mileage may vary if you are not white or LDS. \n\n3. If you choose these majors, you will be able to find a job with a work visa to stay in the US. - Computer Science, Management Information Systems, Accounting, Electrical Engineering. \n\n4. If you join the church you will have potential to get married to a US citizen and get your green card easily. \n\nCons/Negative - \n\n1. If you are not LDS, you will feel very isolated on campus culture.  And occasional obnoxious returned missionaries looking to talk to you in your native language and convert you. They will not have boundaries and will remain creeping on you. :)\n\n2.  Your youth is the best time of you life and formative years, and taking on challenges of being non-LDS and attending BYU would be a ridiculous challenge to take on. You will be depriving yourself abilities to date and/or learn how to build relationship. \n\n3. BYU does not have significant visible racial minorities unlike other universities in the US, and that can lead to feeling more isolated. Also forget about it if you think you are part of LGBT+ community. \n\n4. BYU does not have significant international student population, so you may struggle in relating to your fellow students. They will often say why can't you find a job easily while being ignorant of complications and bur acracy of getting a work visa (H1-B) which is currently through a lottery system. A lot of employers who hire are part of the US govt or US defense industry which require US citizenship or permanent residency to get a job with them. \n\n\nIf your goal is to get out and immigrate to a wealthier prosperous country, I would suggest looking at immigrating to Canada. Also look at another sub /r/IwantOut",

The reason they're getting downvoted is because the isolation is very real and most BYU students/alumni refuse to admit that BYU has some issues. \n\nI'm someone who grew up in the LDS church and am currently planning on leaving the church as soon as I graduate BYU, and that decision has isolated me like crazy. I have very few friends here, but I don't wanna transfer because I can't afford to go anywhere else and I'm way too far in at this point. \n\nYou've never been a member, so odds are everyone will flock to you in order to try and convert you. If you decide to join the church, that's great and you will likely fit in really well here. If you don't decide to join, you will have a really difficult time here. \n\nIf you're really considering this, you should really consider how you feel about the LDS church and think about if you'll feel the same way about it during you're entire time here. If at some point down the line, you decide that there are things about the church that you don't support and you reject the decision to join, you will be pretty miserable.",

I hate the church culture there (grew up in the church in Pennsylvania). BYU is extremely competitive and difficult academics wise. I had a 4.0 in high school and BYU has been difficult for me. I spend most of my time studying and can\u2019t have a social life. When I do have time for friends, a lot of people around me are very self absorbed. Especially the girls. A lot of them are obsessed with their bleach blonde hair and acrylic nails. And the guys are players. Like cookie cutters of each other. Sorry, but pass. I would recommend BYU if you want it for the prestige or the academics it\u2019s known for, but not if you want to have a fun experience in your 20s.",

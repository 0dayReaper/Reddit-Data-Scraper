Get it.\n\nBut as for comparing \"Utah mental health\" to anything else is not necessarily fair.\n\nIt could mean a lot of things. Utahs economy is --booming-- and has been for the last 10 years.\n\nUtah is in the top-ten states for number of individuals with health insurance.\n\nBooming economy... People with disposable income... People with insurance... Means that Utah is going to lead the nation in things tied to health and mental health. \n\nAn uninsured individual in like the top-ten states for --uninsured-- individuals is not going to have the income or insurance to get help.\n\nPeople in Utah get mental health help? Good.\n\nPeople in Utah have more disposable income and can afford goog mental health help? Good.\n\nPeople in Utah have more insurance than average, and Utah is in the top-ten for people with insurance in the United States? Good.\n\nPoor people need mental health help in  West Virginia? They buy cheep booze, and go unreported.\n\nBe -very- careful when you judge Utah on things like this. Utah has a lot of people employed, a lot of people with insurance, a culture that does not encourage heavy drinking to deal with stress. \n\nI have left work after a hard day, and thought, \"Can't wait for the weekend, my friends at Church who love me, my wife who loves me.\"\n\nAnd my friends are like, \"I can't wait to get drunk and forget about this.\"\n\nUtahs culture allows and encourages mental health help? Good.\n\nUtahs economy can support people getting mental health help? Good.\n\n\"UTAH LEADS THE NATION IN PEOPLE GETTING MENTAL HEALTH HELP!\" Good.\n\nBehind the headlines is an economy that can support people getting mental health help. Behind the headline is more people insured in Utah. Behind the headline is a culture where there is less or no shame in getting mental health help. And behind the headline is other cultures that encourage heavy drinking to deal with stress.\n\nA culture that allows, encourages, and supports mental health help is a good thing.",

I hear \"I am going drinking\" after a hard day at work all the time at work. Even among friends who go to other religions.\n\nWhere we don't drink. Stressed? Depressed? Anxiety? Get help. Get professional help.\n\nA Latter-day Saint might seek professional help when another individual might just engage in heavy drinking. \n\nThen the headlines will read: \"Latter-day Saint Goes To Psychologist! The Protestant Doesn't!\"\n\nThe truth... They both probably need mental health help. The Latter-day Saint has insurance and can afford it, and there is not a culture against seeking help, statistically speaking. The \"Protestant\" just drinks heavily to deal with the same thing.",

Makes sense. \n\nUtah has a strong economy. Utah has a lot of people insured. Utah is going to lead the nation in doctor visits and prescriptions.\n\nGood. Good. Good.\n\n&gt;My point to this is that over-use is an issue in Utah. As is cross-use of prescriptions. Plenty of cases of mom taking a kid\u2019s Ritalin and becoming addicted, as I mentioned. \n\nWe know Utah has high numbers of insured individuals. Which leads to a highish numbers of prescriptions and doctor visits.\n\nBut statistics for prescription over-use? Link?\n\nThis link shows Utah low to average for opiod abuse and lower as the years go on... [Link](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/rxrate-maps/index.html)\n\nUtah has higher numbers of people on insurance? Utah will have higher numbers of people getting professional help, even with addictions. Good. Good.\n\nI googled looking for legitimate statistics, and I cannot find any that back up your claim that Ritalin abuse is unique to Utah or Latter-Day Saints.\n\nI was an \"addiction recovery\" Missionary for a few years. I would be curious to see any legitimate study you have. Google failed me. \n\nStimulant abuse is rampant in every culture and state, and Utah is not immune. It is an epidemic. But the link I provided shows Utah is in the middle and low end of abuse.\n\nUtah is not even in the top-20 for illegal drug use... [Link](https://www.porh.psu.edu/drug-use-by-state-2020s-problem-areas-wallethub-study/)\n\nThat statistic includes opioid prescriptions. \n\nBased on the numbers I can see, I am not seeing what you are writing is accurate.\n\nPeople see what they want to see. Latter-day Saints don't drink, they see the doctor more than anyone else, they get legal prescriptions more than anyone else, so therefore they must abuse prescriptions more than anyone else. Wait, what... The conclusion isn't matched by the numbers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;So your point about alcohol is true; but Utahns medicate in other ways sometimes. That has to factor in the big picture.\n\nStimulant abuse is rampant in every culture and in every state. But Utah falls in the middle and low end. \n\nAlcohol abuse... Utah is on the low end... [Link](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/data-stats.htm)\n\nDrug abuse... Utah is on the low end. (link provided above).\n\nFact... Utah residents have insurance at a higher rate than other states.\n\nFact... Utah residents go to the doctor and get prescriptions at a higher rate than other states.\n\nPut those two facts together and come to whatever conclusions you can. But keep in mind. Utah has lower drug use, including prescription drug use... Than other states. And Utah has lower alcoholism compared to other states.",

The actual data was in a State of Utah survey which cross-sectioned LGBTQ+ and religious youth.  They drew some generalities that the original researchers were not comfortable making, but it did support Holland\u2019s Musket Fire call, so there you go.\n\nThere is some correlation to less suicidality in active gay youth than inactive and non-Mormon gay youth in Utah.  But correlation is not causation.  And one study is not definitive.  A lot more research is needed.  \n\nAlso, a lot less active youth come out as gay due to cultural and doctrinal issues.  So they may not be truthful in a survey.  Also, there are many resource organizations to help in Utah (Encircle, Pride Center, etc.) that may be more directly helping the suicide rate than the church.  \n\nLastly, the Church News article has no citations or cross-referencing, so it\u2019s not verifiable.  \n\nA lot more research is needed in this area.",

It is exploding compared to just about everywhere else.\n\nUtah is ranked #9 in the US for insured individuals. \n\nUtahs culture does not encourage heavy drinking.\n\nGay people suffer. Everywhere. Utah-- where people can -statistically- afford mental health help. And West Virginia where they -comparatively, statistically- cannot. Gay people suffer. Everywhere. \n\nGay people needing help should be taken seriously everywhere. In the Church or out of the Church. In Utah or in the Midwest. Everywhere. \n\nBut there are \"lies, dang lies and statistics.\"\n\nOnly class I got a C in in College was Stats, then I came back for my Masters, and Aced it.\n\n\"Lies dang lies and statistics.\" You touch on some important points.\n\nAnd it goes to my original point in this thread. Comparing Utah to anything can be unfair.\n\nUtahs culture does not encourage heavy drinking to deal with stress and anxiety. Utahs culture allows for mental health help, compared to other cultures.\n\nUtahs economy is booming.\n\nUtahs residents have insurance and can pay for mental health help.\n\nGay people in Utah need mental health help? Statistically, compared to other states, more families in Utah can afford mental health help, more families in Utah have more insurance comparatively, and more families in Utah discourage heavy drinking...\n\nCan more be done in just about -every- state? Especially for gay youth? Absolutely.\n\nCan a lot more be done in Utah? Absolutely.",

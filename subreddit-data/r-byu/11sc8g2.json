The limited humanities budget is prioritized for studies that can, in some form, relate their work to the church.\n\nTruth stands alone, but money limits how much truth you can search for in a year. Love it or hate it, the church is going to spend its money on studies they deem important by their standards.",

BYU still teaches evolution, for example, even though scripture has proved it's false for thousands of years!\n\nOn a more serious note, I find the recent push at BYU to limit academic freedom utterly reprehensible. The entire institution is becoming a giant echo chamber and the academic rigor is suffering. I joked earlier about BYU teaching evolution, but higher-ups in the LDS church seriously do want those professors to be teaching creationism, and the pressure has gotten so large that most of the biology professors include a spiel at the start of their evolution unit about what the official church doctrine is.",

There's no place for creationism in scientific discussion as it is completely false and has been debunked over and over again with numerous evidence. \n\nBYU is already doing fine with blending religion and science and creating a balance between them. I have never once felt spiritually unsafe as every single one of the professors and faculty members I've met has been stalwart in their faith. Likewise the quality of the scientific research conducted here has also been excellent. \n\nThis is all a powerplay by the church is exert more control over the university and by extension will limit academy freedom as well as free thinking.",

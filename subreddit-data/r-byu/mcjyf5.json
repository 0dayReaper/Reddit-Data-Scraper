BYU does this by\n\n* geographically limiting supply so undergraduates cannot easily move to more affordable options elsewhere, driving up prices in the limited supply of housing.\n* limiting supply of otherwise code-compliant buildings because, say, the walls of a guys building is too close to the walls of a girls building (\\*cough\\* Blue Ridge \\*cough\\*). Those types of rules are set at BYU's discretion and cause headaches for everyone else.\n* creating barriers to entry for property owners to rent to students, effectively reducing competition by new entrants to the market who could undercut the main management companies.\n* creating so many regulations for the landlords to continue to rent to BYU students. I have heard of a few small landlords who hate working with BYU housing (like having to check whether the renters are attending BYU/UVU/institute/etc.). There are three possible results from this. One, they give up, reducing housing supply and effectively raising prices for renters. Two, unit owners decided to outsource their properties to property managers like Redstone, MVM, and Aspen Ridge, which drives up price for the renter even further because of the overhead (everyone needs a cut). Three, they sell the property to get out of the market completely. This outcome could be good or bad depending on who buys it.\n* lobbying the state legislature to have specific housing exceptions for \" religious educational institutions\" ([Source, e.g. 2.b.ii](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title57/Chapter21/57-21-S3.html?v=C57-21-S3_2015051220150512)) so that BYU can do things like kick people out for not attending school/institute. In any other state, that would be ludicrous. I agree with you that BYU shouldn't be able to \"do what it wants\" in terms of housing. Where I disagree with you is that BYU needs to be \\*taken out\\* of legislation (like the link above), because they're getting special treatment from the state when they are mentioned in legislation.\n\nIt's not a free market when you're actively limiting supply, lobbying the state legislature for specific exceptions, and discouraging new entrants.\n\nThe system that we're in has no checks or balances on the Aspen Ridge/MVM/Redstone triopoly that exists in BYU housing. The cheapest housing is always from the grandparents who have owned an apartment since the 70's and still only charge $250 rent, including utilities. But those options are disappearing, and the management companies know it. That's why rent has been on the steady increase over the last few years. BYU is actively discouraging competition through its anti-free-market rules, and they \\[edit: the management companies\\] know that they control enough of the housing now that the lost business from higher prices won't be significant compared to the gains they could make from an additional $20/mo from 20,000+ students.\n\nWe're not in a free market here, and it's hurting students badly.",

They are, for all intents and purposes, a corporation. They represent their own interest. I agree with all your bullet points, but I'm saying that those things are allowed to happen because of the free market. \n\nFor example, Amazon limits supply by creating cheaper versions of popular products and selling them at far lower prices. Smaller businesses aren't able to compete with their prices, so Amazon crowds them out of the market. In both this case and the case of BYU, we're dealing with a private entity furthering their own interests by taking advantage of the free market. In a free market, every corporation would love to remove all competition and become the sole provider of a good/service.\n\nIf BYU officials were elected by Provo citizens to represent our interests, I would absolutely agree with you. But they aren't \"regulating\" the market, they're just taking actions in the existing market. You said yourself that the system we're in has no checks or balances. Indeed, a totally free market is one without checks or balances. \n\nYou say it's a triopoly. Monopolies are prevented/broken up by Antitrust laws (i.e. regulation). It sounds like you and I generally agree on the state of things, I'm just saying that BYU and these management companies are doing exactly what companies will try to do in a free market--look after themselves. We need regulation (often in the form of antitrust action) to allow competition to exist.",

Many of the issues come from overreach of the government including putting so many black men in prison for stupid \u201ccrimes\u201d and then making the single mothers dependent on welfare instead of releasing men from prison. \n\nPoverty is also a bad measure. You should look at how much money people \u201cspend\u201d not make. It\u2019s in people\u2019s best interest to report lower income for tax purposes among others. America consumes at a very high rate. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re going to say we\u2019re \u201clast among developed countries\u201d I would recommend you brush up on your statistics. For example, education. People like to talk about how low America is compared to other countries, but when you adjust for what is actually statistically significant, the gaps disappear. If you run a race and come in 100th place but 1st-99th all tie at 2:00 and you come in at 2:01, it\u2019s not really that bad. \n\nAlso America is far from extreme capitalism. It\u2019s extremely throttled by the government. We have a corporatism style economy and it\u2019s not really a free market because the government bails out large companies, invests your taxes into many and ties your quality of life to the outcomes of GM, creates monopolies by giving favoritism to some companies, subsidizing some, and adding regulations to inhibit competition. \n\nThis isn\u2019t even to mention the extremely anti-capitalist practice of not allowing citizens to buy medication, such as insulin, from other countries. This drastically launches the price whereas free trade would lower the cost. \n\nI\u2019m not arguing for anarcho-capitalism, but you have to be aware that in the case of regulation and rules it is a double edged sword, or even a hydra of sorts. Because every rule you make to solve a problem requires another rule or several to fix the inequality created by the first rule.",

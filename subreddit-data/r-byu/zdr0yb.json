Does anyone know anything about this, as I would obviously prefer to have them taken through the school vs paying a photographer. Any and all info is appreciated.",

I got mine taken back in February of this year and later reached out to get my headshot and never got anything back. Good idea in theory, less so in practice from my experience at least.",

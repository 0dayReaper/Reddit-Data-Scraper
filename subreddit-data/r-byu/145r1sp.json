    "postText": "This will be my first semester at BYU as a transfer student and I\u2019d like to know how is the culture here when it comes to POC / Minorities? \nI\u2019m from California which is known for being a hispanic prominent state and to be honest I\u2019m quite concerned about dealing with racism or typical micro aggressions. I\u2019ve had my number of encounters with this before and is definitely something that shouldn\u2019t be happening at this point anymore but that\u2019s the sad reality for many of us. I\u2019d appreciate if you could give me your honest opinion about how Hispanic people are seen/treated here. I\u2019m excited for this new path but can\u2019t help but feel terrified of being an outcast just for sharing my culture and traditions/music or being who I am.",

            "comment": "As a male Latino, it was only a little weird. I never felt discriminated against in any overt way. Maybe some micro aggressions here and there but usually I felt welcomed. The only thing is that you will probably feel a cultural shock as you will now be a minority. I\u2019m also originally from California and it was uncomfortable at times being the only Latino in a class or ward when I grew up in a pretty diverse place. Oh and dating, that was kind of rough for me, but I think Latinas would fare better than Latinos. Overall, I would say you don\u2019t have much to worry about!",

Go to the Multicultural Student Services in the Wilk to meet more POC and LatinX. I've felt welcome there and have enjoyed the counselors. That's a great place to share your traditions, culture, and music. Within the student body, there are microaggressions here and there. Also, depending on your major, you'll most likely be the minority (in my STEM classes I'm 1 of 3 POC in the class out of 57). Ultimately, you won't be an outcast. Everyone has treated with me respect and kindness. (Also join Hispanos Unidos! It's a great club! Also there is Salsa night in the Wilk if you're into that!)",

You should use an appropriate lock to keep it safe and register you bike with BYU Police as all bikes ridden on campus are required to be registered. [https://bike.byu.edu/](https://bike.byu.edu/)   \n\n\nI'd research the best lock options you have because you don't want to be riding a $2K bike and locking it up with a $20 lock.   \n\n\nThis isn't to say that students are going to steal your bike but there are a lot of people who cross campus and may take advantage of the trusting nature of folks at BYU.",

If you are really worried you could put a gps tracker on it. You might consider keeping it in your apartment at night because it's more likely to get stolen outside your apartment in the middle of the night than it is during the day locked up on campus with crowds of people walking past regularly.",

            "comment": "I would double lock with a  wrapped chain and a d/u-lock. The d/u-lock (if it's good) would pretty much need an angle grinder to get through and the chain is good for locking the components and is more annoying with an angle grinder since it can bounce around. That's the most safe but you can decide how secure you want it. With an e-bike weight is less of an issue so I figured you might want to go all out.\n\nLike others have said, bike security is probably a bigger concern at your apartment at night. That's where my bike was stolen from with only a chain lock. Now I have my new bike in the apartment at night and locked with a chain while at school.\n\nMake sure to register your bike with byu/provo!",

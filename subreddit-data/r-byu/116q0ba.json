    "postText": "I'm fairly confused about the difference between simple proctor and no proctor when taking exam. I am taking a C++ exam administered through learning suite and we are to use an in-browser program to code with. I know sometimes they track your tabs or screen record, and i was wondering if I would get flagged for switching to my other tab to code with. I guess my real question is:   \nDo both simple proctor and no proctor track your screens? Will I get flagged for switching tabs to my code even if it doesnt say it's proctored? I don't want to potentially get in trouble or anything.",

            "comment": "I'm not sure what the LS simple proctor captures, although it is limited in scope compared with something like Examity. However, I think the best thing you could do is ask your professor if doing what you describe would be OK since, ultimately, your professor is the cheating referee and not Learning Suite.",

You would know if they were recording your screen as your OS would give you some sign. \nProctorio up or examity, on the other hand, track all of that so I wouldn\u2019t recommend switching tabs on that. From the sounds of your situation though, you should be good to switch tabs and look stuff up while your working.",

(I use to TA for a class and caught people cheating this way). It doesn\u2019t show what they are looking at on the other tab, so for sure email your professor.",

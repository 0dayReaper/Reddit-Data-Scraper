If your hometown is close enough to Provo to reasonably commute you could just use your home address. You're ecclesiastical endorsement for sophomore year would also likely out you as living non-contracted as your bishop would come from a ward that covers non-contracted housing. In the end it will be a fine you have to pay for it.   \n\n\nThere are some good options that aren't on campus and if you ask around you may find out which ones have older students if that is your problem.   \n\n\nI realize the other question behind this might be if you want to live with buddies who live in non-contracted housing. You can always ask the housing office to get an exemption but there is no guarantee they'll grant one for you.",

Also you can call the complexes to see if they have a list of people who are trying to sell. Also if you contact the BYU housing office (just call or email) I have heard that they have been a little more lenient with that rule bc there are not as many complexes offering BYU contracted housing. So if you tell them you are having a hard time you would probably get help and or leniency.",

I started in a winter semester due to my mission, and finding housing was hard. Basically the only on-campus spots left were in Helaman Halls (which was a little outside my budget), so I pretty much had to just sit and wait for something good to show up on the off-campus housing portal. After I got to BYU, it was easier to find places, but I had to start early (i.e., I generally had a place picked out by the end of March, sometimes earlier).\n\nThere's less off-campus contracted housing now, so that's probably harder to get into, though it's my understanding that landlords are supposed to give preference to first-year students. There should be more on-campus housing available now that BYU owns the Riviera, but turnover in the middle of the school year is pretty low; it's mostly just people getting married or leaving on missions.\n\nBased on my experience as a grad student at a different university, my guess would be that once you're outside the contracted/on-campus housing requirement, you'll still want to start early to get into a good place. Housing in college towns tends to go fast, and you'll also have to deal with the fact that there's an ongoing housing shortage along the Wasatch Front as a whole.",

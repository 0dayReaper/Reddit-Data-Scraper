            "comment": "So today the BYU bookstore, only one week before the start of the semester, is requiring every freshman to buy their textbooks exclusively from their store. The only way to opt out is to physically go IN PERSON and request a cancellation of charge, and it has to be done before the add/drop deadline or else you\u2019re screwed. \n\nIf you\u2019re studying away from campus, there\u2019s no way to escape this. \n\nAdditionally, according to the [faq](https://www.byustore.com/student-first), this will continue every year starting with the freshman class so that by 2023 every BYU student will be forced into this program. \n\nI\u2019m going to be contacting the bookstore and STRONGLY ask them to discontinue this. I plead with everyone who sees this to do the same. Start a petition, call, or write the administration.\n\nAnd to all incoming freshman, the bookstore should be your last resort, not your first option. You can find textbooks online for only 20%-30% of the bookstore\u2019s selling price most of the time. I can\u2019t remember a time when I actually bought a book from the bookstore after my first semester at byu.\n\nEdit: u/mspixton pointed out that the person to email is mark_clegg@byu.edu\n\nEdit 2: Luckily the byu store finally made a clarification. It seems like they won\u2019t charge you if you don\u2019t pick up your books which is much much better than what we thought. Hopefully this gets updated in the FAQ.",

Second, go to [compliance.byu.edu](https://compliance.byu.edu/) and email their office at [compliance@byu.edu](mailto:compliance@byu.edu) . Make sure, in doing this, to present every bit of information, specifically how the booklist used to operate, how it does now, and how this change will effect students negatively, both right now and in general.\n\nHopefully we can get this travesty stopped.",

If they are required, and I can't find them for free, I find the cheapest price, which is usually byu book exchange or renting on Amazon.\n\nIt varies semester to semester (last semester I ended up having to pay $60 for an online textbook), but for most semesters I end up paying $0-20 for books.

Luckily, you don't pay for them right away, and you have until the add drop deadline to return, and over a month to pay.\n\nIt helps, almost, but mostly hinders and just gives them more money.",

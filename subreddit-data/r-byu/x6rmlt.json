If you agree to participate, you will complete a survey asking questions about your views on the Covid-19 vaccine and a short vaccine literacy assessment. The survey should take 5-10 minutes to complete.  \n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed it, feel free to copy the link and send it to anyone else you know between the ages of 18-24 to take or share this post! Thank you so much for your time!! All response are greatly appreciated!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\nHere\u2019s the link: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5iWT1ml6YZCeUAiPB6opDOfD7oDGn_kpzNLzpGtidbik8pg/viewform?usp=sf_link",

If you really want any meaningful data I would ask your advisor for suggestions of how to get access to lists that might fit your criteria that you can solicit.",

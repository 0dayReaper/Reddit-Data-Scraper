Description:

Welcome!
Welcome to the Unofficial Subreddit for Brigham Young University! Feel free to contribute to the community by discussing anything and everything BYU-Related!

Rules:

Be Civil: A bit of banter or trash talk is fine, but don't cross the line. If things do get out of hand you will be warned or even banned for a few days. Repeatedly breaking this rule will lead to a permanent ban. If you've been asked by a mod to read the rules, be sure to read all the rules.

Relevant Submissions: Any type of submission is welcome (Videos, News Articles, Discussions, Questions, etc) as long as it is related directly to BYU. The only exception being Honor Code posts unless there is new news about it. Please no "Why do I have to shave every day?" submissions. We all understand Brigham Young University has some strange rules.


Tasteful Submissions: Please keep your submissions tasteful. Comments that express hate, are threatening, or are demeaning to any individual or group will be removed. This includes comments towards people who may not share the same belief system as you.


Religious Submissions: Religious conversations must be directly related to BYU. While BYU is owned and operated by a religious institution, it is a university first and foremost and we would like to keep the conversations here about the university itself. Submissions that include religion within them are allowed as long as it is still directly related to BYU.


Advertising: Any events, services or items advertised in this community should be directly related to BYU.

Doxing: The practice of researching and broadcasting private or identifiable information about an individual is considered harmful behavior and will not be tolerated in this community.

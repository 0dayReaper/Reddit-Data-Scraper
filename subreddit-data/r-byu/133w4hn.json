You have a school-provided email (@byu.edu) that gives you access to Office 365 thanks to BYU paying Microsoft so their students have access to software.\n3. Never never never never never click on a link in an email that you are not expecting. Did you request a password reset and then you got an email from that site right afterwards? Probably okay to use that link. An unsolicited link like this one? Nope.\n4. Contact BYU IT tomorrow directly and ask them, but also inform them about this scam. They need information because someone will definitely fall for this and they will have work to do. Don't click on the link in the email. Tomorrow, if you don't know how to contact BYU IT, find the Office Of IT link on the official BYU webpage (should be at the bottom, then scroll to the bottom of the IT page where there should be contact information).\n5. Consider deleting this post, since you posted your name in it.\n6. Consider censoring the URL (less necessary)\n7. URL shortening can be legitimate, but you need to be wary of the sources. It should raise a red flag any time you see one (such as the URL in the image). Do not click them before verifying where they came from. Even if a friend sent me a short URL I'd verify it's them before clicking it.",

            "comment": "Anything that Casey Griffiths teaches. He's a fast talker so you need to be good at taking notes, but he's great at explaining doctrine in a way you'll remember. His tests are closed notes/closed book BUT they're through learning suite (no testing center) and his TAs do a study session on zoom and it covers everything on the test. I took each test immediately after that study session and they weren't too bad. Also he does use proctorio sometimes but only the part that records your screen, not the camera or mic.\n\nKent Brooks is even easier. He gives out a study guide for each class period, makes it very clear what the answers are, and then his open note tests almost perfectly match the study guide. I think the lowest grade I got on a test was 97%. Unfortunately he is dealing with medical issues right now so I don't think he's teaching this semester :(\n\nAvoid the celebrity teachers. I took a class from Wilcox and he's a great teacher but his tests were extremely difficult. I have not taken a class from Hank Smith but have been told he assigns a 10 page paper, imo way too much for a 2 credit religion class.",

His Foundations of the Restoration class was great and I never felt like the few papers you had to write were very difficult or taxing. Plus he's got a good sense of humor and keeps it from being too dry or serious. And yes the test while closed note weren't anything ridiculous and are much lower stress since they are on learning suite.",

            "comment": "I just took REL A 121 (First half of the book of Mormon) with Josh Sears, and I felt like the coursework was still manageable even though I took it during Spring term! The only assignments other than tests were daily reading assignments (with a quiz attached), and a weekly (might be every two weeks) exegetical exercise. The reading assignments were somewhat long, but I was taking it as a term class so the schedule was much more compressed than a typical semester. There's a reading guide with questions to answer/watch for while you read, and he'll choose a few random questions directly from those for the reading quizzes so as long as you actually do the reading you'll almost always get 100% on the quizzes. The exegetical exercises basically walk you through how to interpret scriptures in context of the time they were written, and they only take about 20-30 minutes max. \n\nThe tests for that class were also not bad, half of the questions are pulled directly from the reading questions (so it's just like the reading quizzes), and the other half come from class discussions but he would spend a class period reviewing everything right before the test. The most difficult part is you have to memorize two specific scriptures, but it's not too bad and most people scored really well on the tests and in the class. Plus I felt like the material was interesting and he presented it well! The best part is there were no papers, I really hate writing papers so this class was awesome",

His tests can be tough but his study guides are super comphrensive, almost overboard. I came away from that class with a better appreciation of Isaiah and he had a good sense of humor too that spiced things up a lot.",

I just moved to the area and I'm having a really hard time meeting people and making friends. Are there any groups at BYU or activities I could attend even though I'm technically not a full student?",

            "comment": "Pretty much anything. Last semester I was not technically a student at BYU, but I was still involved with a couple of clubs on campus, and there were no problems at all. Also, I do not know if you are LDS, but a lot of the socializing in Provo is centered around the church. You likely live near a YSA ward that offers a lot of social opportunities, even if you aren't religious.",

Lots of them even serve food at their meetings. \n\nBYU also has an events calendar, it\u2019s not super comprehensive, but it shows a few cool things every week.",

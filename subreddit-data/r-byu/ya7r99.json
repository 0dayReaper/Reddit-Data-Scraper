I took it with Brau and it was test based. It wasn't too difficult and you can drop one test. But if you wanna get into the bschool you should aim for an A- or A, so I will take it later.",

I believe you can see past tests online. over the summer they went over the probabilities a lot, but there are also a lot of curves and some beginner college-level algebra.\n\nkeep in mind that classes over the summer might be shortened so they probably won't cover all the material or they will cover it quickly., so they will go fast. Also, my instructor was a grad student and he wasn't really that available when I asked for help. Your mileage might vary",

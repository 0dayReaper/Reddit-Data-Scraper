            "comment": "On the southern end of campus, the lawn below the honors building has a great view of the Y. Also the honors building is very photogenic. The byu sign by the stadium is cool, but usually busy - I\u2019d recommend the one down the steps from the honors building by brick oven pizza/tennis courts. Duck pond is also good. Those three are very close together so if you plan you can hit duck pond, head to the byu sign, up the stairs and get the honors building and mountains with the Y \n\n(I suppose the Y might not be visible if the snow doesn\u2019t melt soon)\n\nYou might also consider getting a good shot of you with whatever building you spent the most time at, just for memories.",

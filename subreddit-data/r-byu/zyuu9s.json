They just reopened it after being closed for COVID so I imagine there\u2019s some pet up demand and so it might be more selective.\n\nThe main site (https://jerusalemcenter.ce.byu.edu/) is returning errors right now, but this link below has the email address and phone number of the Provo office:\n\nhttps://www.byu-jc.org/contact",

Definitely doable if you aren\u2019t working and don\u2019t pile on a third class or a time consuming calling or something, but I hope you don\u2019t get burned out quickly on mathematics.\n\nCan\u2019t speak for Econ 378 from personal experience, but from what I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s probably the bigger concern of the two classes. Hopefully someone on here has taken it and can offer advice.",

However, I do know one of the devotionals a few years ago when I was there was by someone I knew from my home stake and the speaker\u2019s sim and niece gave the prayers, so it seems like it may be influenced by the speaker. My guess is they ask the speaker if there\u2019s any students they\u2019d like to give the chance to before they find someone (Disclaimer, I still have no clue just 1 anecdote).",

    "postText": "So I'm a senior in my last semester and needed a few credits to pad my schedule out and decided to take racquetball since I've never picked classes early enough to get I to the SWELL classes that everyone talks so highly of. However, I have no idea what to do or bring or where to go. Do I change for the first day? Do I have a locker? How does the rb work in general? (I'm a guy if that affects responses at all) \n\nI tend to get a bit anxious in places like gyms and locker rooms and I think a lot of this is contributing to the feelings of concern and not knowing what in doing. Part of why I took the class in the first place is to help me get out of my comfort zone, so I'm trying to get as much info going in as I can so that I can hopefully make this a good growth experience.\n\nAny advice or info is greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "yeh im pretty familiar with the rb! so there are locker rooms with lockers, showers, bathrooms, and sauna for men and women in both the rb and the smith field house (the locker rooms in the rb is the way to get to the pool), the way to get into the locker room is to tap your id card on the door scanner. Lockers are free you just choose one of the small lockers and bring your own combination lock (there are lockers available in the hallway of the rb that come with locks you just have to ask the front desk about them) thats basically it for locker rooms. also if you don't know where the raquetball courts are I would ask for directions because they're a little hard to find!",

I never experienced a time when all the lockers were taken, and I usually found a locker in the first 3 or so rows. \n\nYou **can** arrive to class in shorts and a T already and leave your stuff in the hallway outside the racquetball rooms. During a class this is *probably* safe, but there's always a risk someone will just walk through and pick up your bag and walk off. You won't be able to see your things while playing as the courts have non-glass (cement?) walls, so don't plan on just keeping an eye on your stuff.\n\nYou'll need a racquet, some balls and protective eyewear. \n\nHere's a marked up screenshot of the RB map. Unless you hear otherwise, you will probably meet in the hallway outside of the courts. \n\nIf your class is like mine there will be a bunch of first-time players, a couple of people who have played some and a few really good players who took the only racquetball course that fit in their schedule. I'm sure you'll have fun!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/YIhcbTx",

I would get to the locker room in the RB and the courts weren't too far away, but as far as I am aware, I was the only one in my class who did that. I have no idea what the other students did. I never saw anyone in the locker room, but it worked for me.",

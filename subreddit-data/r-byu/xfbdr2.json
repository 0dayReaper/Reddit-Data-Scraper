I had some of the pizza recently and it was just fine but nothing to write home about. Feel like the root beer is overrated personally.\n\nMost things I've had range from meh to ok, what do you actually like there?",

It only worked for pickup, not delivery, and you have to show your school ID when you get to the restaurant. I don't know if they've stopped doing it or not, but it's worth a try.",

The on tap root beer and pizza sampler is fun even if it's not the best pizza. \n\n\nBut with that said...yeah I still think it's overrated and probably overpriced. It's the kind of place you go to revisit old traditions and old memories that I don't mind going to occasionally. I would never recommend Brick Oven and rarely would choose it over the other better tasting and better priced pizza options that are nearby.",

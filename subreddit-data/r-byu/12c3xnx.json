When I did take the class, it fit all the requirements you listed. Plus it was super interesting.\n\nI also took a history of dance class during a summer term that may count for a social studies credit. That one was pretty easy, especially if you like dancing. Many of the assignments, if not most, were things like putting a dance together with some classmates. It was pretty chill, especially in the summer.",

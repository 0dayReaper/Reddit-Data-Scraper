    "postText": "Looking for Off-Campus Wheelchair accessible apartment. It doesn\u2019t have to be even advertised that way though. If a manual wheelchair user can enter your front door, and enter your bathroom, then drop it down in the comments. Really asking for peoples best judgements based on where they live or have been or what they might already know of. \n\nBonus if it is a shared room that is sub $500. \n\nIf the unit is a private room, but has sub $500 shared room in the same building or unit, then drop those too. \n\nDrop whatever you can think of. \n\nDouble bonus if the website has a virtual tour or good pictures. \n\nPlaces I\u2019ve already looked into: Alpine village, arcadia. \n\n\u00a1Muchos gracias!",

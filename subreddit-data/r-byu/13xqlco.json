    "postText": "Last school year, I took the CE 1010 English, HTHS 1001, and HTHS 1020 classes through Weber State University, and I am in the process of receiving my transcript from Weber. Do you guys know if these credits will transfer over to BYU? I got an A in each of the courses, so I'm just wondering if I should put a first year English class on my schedule if there's a possibility I won't need to take it.",

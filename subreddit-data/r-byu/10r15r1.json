(So i dont have to pay back the pell grant refund i got in addition to my scholarship) I know it would wreck my gpa but\u2026 i dont really care, I care more about the fact that im so stressed im going insane from lack of sleep and I need to reevaluate whether college is even for me.",

So dropping out will mean that you can't keep your on campus job.\n\nCan you drop any of the classes? Or is that too late? That might affect your pell grant though.\n\nHave you looked into taking any of them as pass/fail? I didn't go to school here, so the system may be different, but my most stressful semester I switched two of the classes to pass/fail so that all I had to do was get a passing grade. Then I figured out the minimum amount of work in those classes and just did that and nothing more. You would need to verify some things with the professors to make sure you don't auto-fail if you stop attending or don't take certain tests (midterm and final, for example).",

            "comment": "Sorry this is a tough semester. I'd say first get the help you need and worry about college later. You'd be surprised at how many people have some bad years and it has no bearing on their later happiness.\n\nAs far as failing: when a student fails, when entering the grade the professor has to enter the last time the student showed up and did some work. If you don't attend a certain amount of time (I don't know what that is), they will definitely claw back the grants and scholarship money. I am a professor and have received emails from the administration clarifying how much the student did in the class, etc. I think it's actually a federal thing with the grants -- trying to avoid scams of taking money and not going to school.\n\nI urge you to talk first to CAPS for mental health. Then, talk to your college's academic advisement. They can help you figure out the best steps. A lot of students have similar struggles, so know that you are not alone.",

There could be exceptions, as I know there are high school students working in the cougareat. But that's one option is dropping down to that many, since you want your job it sounds like you'll still be in the area. You can also look into 2nd term classes to keep the credit hour minimum.\n\nAnd if you do end up withdrawing, don't worry, you're definitely not the only one \ud83d\ude09",

You may be able to get out of a housing contract that way as well, but I am unsure. Don't get your hopes up on that one.\n\nTalk to the Registrar's Office, and don't wait. There are deadlines for 75% and 50% tuition refund too, I think, so don't dawdle.",

Because I had proof of attending classes, I didn\u2019t have to pay back Pell grant money. They told me the proof could be as little as turning in an assignment on canvas, as long as they have something. BYU is absolutely a death by a thousand papercuts kind of place and you should not feel bad for taking a few Ls along the way. Most professors have their head up their ass thinking their class is worthy of your utmost respect as they teach some freshman writing class that is only there because some committee picked it in the 60s and no one has stopped to think whether we actually need it because the cardinal sin in BYU management is challenging the status quo",

    "postText": "I want to become EMT certified through BYU. However, this is my last full semester before I start the junior core of the electrical engineering program, so my course load's somewhat heavy (MATH 213+215, CS 235, EC EN 220, PHSCS 220). Any insight on how manageable my classes are, and if an extra eight hours of EMT stuff per week is doable?\n\nEDIT: Thanks, everyone, for the responses! Decided to wait on my certification because I have a feeling the classes WON'T come easily to me. Next winter semester it is\ud83d\udcaa",

            "comment": "213 is sometimes a little difficult, while 215 is extremely easy as everyone always ends up sharing their answers online or over the Slack channel, 235 is rather simple but interesting as long as your professor is good. Not sure about the others. But EMT would be good to do now before you jump into the intensive core course work",

That includes a sheet reporting results from 100 patient assessments, and each assessment takes 5-10 minutes. During these you can practice the skills you will be tested on in the psychomotor/\"hands on\" portion of the final.   \n3 After completing the course finals (cognitive and psychomotor), you will have to take the state test to be certified, which you will have time to study for after finals.",

There is a lot of in person class time, but I found I was able to do most of my 100 patient assessments during class (they give you time to practice). So if you're okay with the 8 hours of class time a week, you should be fine to add it on.",

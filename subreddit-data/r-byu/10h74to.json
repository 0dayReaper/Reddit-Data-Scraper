    "postText": "Hello, fellow Cougs. I come as a representative of the creamery on 9th in our time of need. New leadership has taken place, and is starting to crack down on our workers. Specifically, our hard working closing crew. Now, I\u2019m sure some of you lovely ladies and gents have seen our fun little name tags, with our customized stickers: \u201cbread 9\u201d, \u201cbread bread bread bread\u201d, \u201cUtah bread\u201d, and \u201cGroceries fear me\u201d-a fun little tidbit we like to add.\n\nManagement has seen these as \u201cunprofessional\u201d and \u201cnot fitting for work\u201d, seeming to forget that we are a college campus.\n\nIs this a small deal being taken as a big one? Probably. Is it not worth your time? Most likely. Am I being too sensitive with my feelings? Most definitely.\n\nBut we\u2019d appreciate the help regardless.\n\nAny advice, ideas, and suggestions on how we can combat this great atrocity would be most appreciated. \n\nMay the rebellion live on.\n\n-A local Creamery worker",

I\u2019m not a student anymore, and honestly don\u2019t know what you can do, but I\u2019d sign a petition or hold of purchasing ranch dressing in protest until the stickers are allowed to continue. We can\u2019t let the tyrants win!",

But the political landscape changed around us.\n\nFor ever and ever Provo was loyally Republican.  But when I was a grad student in 2016 and lived in South Provo.  My neighborhood voted for McMullin.\n\nSpoke with my mission president (BYU professor).  He says his entire department faculty is solidly anti-Trumpism (but still politically conservative).

He would have been well within his authority to quash the rioting and looting with the insurrection act, but force necessary to do this would have generated enough bad publicity to likely cost him the election. So the feds have been deputizing local authorities and charging people at the federal level since local prosecutors are supporting the riots and letting people off. With the exception of this week thanks to the Breonna Taylor debacle, throwing rioters in jail has been a rather effective strategy in ending the riots.",

The very nature of conservatives is to conserve the traditions of the past. Things like religion tend to slow and provide resistance to progress. \n\nWith conservatives denying/not supporting the most obvious upcoming crisis (climate change) they are ignoring every scientist in the world. That alone (we don\u2019t even need to talk about the other ones) is enough to agree that democrats stand more on the side of science. \n\nYou think those with power truly don\u2019t believe in climate change? It\u2019s literally right in front of our eyes. But conservatives are in favor with the wealthy and powerful and will appeal to what they want. Which is to continue to make money at the expense of the planet. So conservatives keep making policies to trash the future of the planet and republican voters keep on eating that shit up like it\u2019s candy and thinking \u201coh yeah fuck those dems, I can\u2019t believe they actually think climate change is real.

That's horrible logic, it justifies headshot assassinations and murdering people because they're asleep. This is what I'm talking about. Almost every justification anti life/pro choice people have also justifies horrible actions against people who have been born. Plus, if you look at it logically, either you recognize a fetus is a human with rights at conception or you're a terrible person. Sounds hyperbolic but I've got a flowchart with all the arguments I've heard and those are the only two outcomes, which is why I'm pro life. That sounds ridiculous and I'd give an example, but you literally just did. If you'd like to prod more, answer this question:\n\nIf it's a human life with rights and value, can you kill it?",

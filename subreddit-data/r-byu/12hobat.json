            "comment": "I've lived at Heritage for the last year or so. Living in Heritage is super convenient since it's pretty much the closest to campus overall. It's right next to the Creamery and allows fast access to most things campus has to offer. That being said, contracts are only by-semester outside of Fall/Winter being bundled, so you have to move at least twice a year usually and that also means the Heritage student wards have crazy turnover and you'll change wards multiple times a year. All in all, Heritage's biggest upside is it's convenience due to location and it's biggest downside is the inconsistent turnover in who you room with, who's in your ward, etc. There's also the chance you end up living with/being in a ward of people who are just out of high school, which if you're older can be a little odd...",

Most all off campus places sell only year-round contracts.\n\nIf you do the math, it is cheaper to live at heritage fall/winter then buy a cheap summer contract from someone selling theirs than it is to stay at most of those off campus places all year",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve lived in both Helaman and Heritage. Helaman pros: close to Cannon center and a smaller Creamery, not much to clean for cleaning checks. Also lots of getting to know people in a close area, because of how many people are on each floor. Cons include sharing bathrooms with everyone in the hall (and shower stalls, meaning having to bring all shower stuff back and forth from room to bathroom). Also sometimes, because of the bathroom setup, it can be awkward when a member of the opposite sex is in the hall unexpectedly.\nHeritage pros: Sharing an apartment with a smaller group of people, actual bathrooms, a working kitchen (compared to basically an oven for the entire building in Helaman). I also personally preferred the way the rooms were laid out/the apartment style better. Cons: Having to prepare own food more (which itself is can be good or bad), which also means more dishes, more to clean, more to negotiate with roommates about potentially (kitchenware and bathroom space, for example).",

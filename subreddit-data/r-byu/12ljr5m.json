Few of us venture beyond vague sentiment but if there\u2019s anywhere we should be prodded to do so, it\u2019s in places like the Maeser building.\n\nThat said, there are a couple problems with this piece he penned this past Fall:\n\nhttps://squaretwo.org/Sq2ArticleHancockGospelMethodology.html\n\nFirst, when he writes: \u201c\u2026 a group that actually brandishes the name \u2018Black Menaces\u2019 are allowed relatively free reign\u2026\u201d.  I gotta stop him right there: the actual phrase is \u201cfree rein\u201d. Its provenance is equestrian. He repeats a common but annoying malapropism. \n\nProbably more importantly, even though I understand that Dr. Hancock has always been a recruiter in search of an army to defend BYU from the barbarians at its gates (or otherwise recording TikToks on its campus)\u2026 \u201cbrandishing\u201d is an unfortunate word choice in this context, besides being ridiculously dramatic.  \n\nIn any case, the full graf, for context:\n\n&gt;The recruitment of faithful and intellectually and morally courageous students. This has been a clear emphasis of university leaders in the recent conference. But of course, this depends on bishops, stake presidents, and admissions officers who understand and are committed to the university\u2019s distinctive mission \u2014 and in particular to the Family Proclamation \u2014 and on BYU personnel willing to stand behind this mission. The reality is that many of these Church and university officers may themselves be divided between the Restored Gospel and the religion of compassionate liberation. Alas, under the present system, LGBT+ activists and a group that actually brandishes the name \u201cBlack Menaces\u201d are allowed relatively free reign *(sic)*, while more traditional, faithful, or conservative groups are restricted, presumably in the name of avoiding divisiveness and controversy.",

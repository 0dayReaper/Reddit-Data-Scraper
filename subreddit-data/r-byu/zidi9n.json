    "postText": "Hi all. The BYU application for Fall 2023 is due this Thursday. I've been working for so long to get my ecclesiastical endorsement finished, but things keep going wrong for me. At first the bishop claimed to not see my name, but I had it set to the wrong term. Then I made it so he would see it and he claimed that he figured it out, but when I tried to see my form to find my progress, it looks like that original form was deleted. I don't know what's going on, and I'm running out of time. I'll try to call BYU tomorrow or Monday, but I don't understand what's going on. If anyone can help me, that would be incredible. I'm running out of time!",

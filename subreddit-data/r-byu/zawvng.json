Good principle of course, but it stressed me out. So in high school I saved and applied for over thirty scholarships. \n\nI got pretty lucky, but I still have some expenses that aren't covered. At one point after my mission, I was working three jobs and donating plasma to stay out of debt. On an interesting note, I think many times working part-time has a positive effect on students' grades and social life. you meet more people, genuinely learn more, and are forced to manage your time. Good life skills. \n\nAlso, this part is obvious, but paying tithing means that the Lord will always help in His own time and in His own way.

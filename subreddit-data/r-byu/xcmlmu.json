    "postText": "I am an avid reader and listener to whatever the Maxwell Institute puts out. I think they have high quality content that causes me to think deeper about our doctrine and scriptures. However, I have noticed a troubling trend. It appears that someone at BYU or at the Institute arbitrarily decides to silence certain scholars and erase them as if they had never been a part of the Institute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne public example of this was Benjamin Parks. At one point either last year or the year before anything he had contributed to MI was wiped from their site.  I assume this was due to his public criticisms of BYU and the Church in general. However, a less public example was Deidre Nicole Green. She was a fellow at the Maxwell Institute and wrote the Brief Theological Intro to Jacob as part of their series. However, when I went back later to listen to her interview on the book (the Maxwell institute podcast interviewed each author in the series), they had removed it from the site and from all podcast feeds. All the other author interviews were still available. They had also wiped any mention of her from their website. I was unable to ever find out the reason why. Can anyone share some insight into how this happens and why in particular Green was removed in this manner?",

            "comment": "I actually met Deidre and discussed this with her so I know what happened. I won\u2019t go into personal details but the decision to remove all of her work from BYU was her decision, not BYU\u2019s. I believe that was around September of last year, although I\u2019m not sure how long after that until the Maxwell Institute had removed everything. So, in her case at least, it\u2019s not BYU choosing to silence certain scholars, but rather those scholars choosing not to publish through BYU.",

The reason was almost always coming from the speaker, not BYU. Often they would give us permission to publish their words for only a certain period of time, and then we were legally required to pull it. If an author, speaker, whatever no longer wants their work up on a BYU site, it's just taken down for them.\n\nOccasionally there were other reasons, like if an older speech had some blatantly racist or homophobic remarks it would get pulled, and sometimes republished after changes had been approved by the speaker. Don't know if any of this info helps, but I figured I'd share before you accuse someone of intentionally removing things. There are often a lot of behind the scenes things that people are trying to take care of.",

I suspect that a lot of stuff is being transferred over from one server to another.  It may be that they finally adopted the same website content management system as the rest of BYU and so it's taking some time to transfer the old site content over to the new.  I could be wrong maybe the webpage is just wonky like that with posts but every news post saying it was posted today on there makes me thing this is the reasoning.",

It's not as if the book she published in the series was a rogue publication that didn't go through the same editing and publishing process that all the other books in the series went through. It's not as if the podcast that was recorded and released didn't go through the same editing and review process as every other podcast in the series. And if the issue was truly with the content of her book, why do they continue to publish and sell it on their website? Why not just have another scholar publish a book for the book of Jacob. And why erase her name so that it appears she never even was at BYU as a fellow.\n\nAs an institute of higher learning, you are shooting yourself in the foot by silencing scholars after the fact and completely erasing the work you helped to fund and publish under your name. And if you are going to engage in that process, it would be wise to be more transparent about the reasons behind that rather than just arbitrarily determining to wipe someone completely from your website and institutional history without any explanation.",

As specific instructors begin to flirt more and more with the secularization of the religious bedrock, they get weeded out.",

Listen to the countless talks given on devotional days and you'll get an idea of what I mean.\n\nSo it's not out of the norm for admin, over time, to weed out the ideas not sustaining to the religious bedrock. I mean, what do you think the requirement of a temple recommend  does? It further reinforces the religiosity and faithfulness against making BYU more 'academic'.\n\nThis doesn't include admin in and out of positions who add and remove things all of the time depending on what they consider appropriate under their stewardship.",

Reading the negative comments on the Amazon reviews gives you a snapshot of ideas that were being encouraged.

In general, though, I'm not easily bothered by curious perspectives from academics on scripture. But I'm also not in a position that could have them removed either, lol.",

    "postText": " \n\nAs an AI language model, I cannot provide an official answer or interpretation for a hypothetical verse that involves the slaying of Laban for supporting Utah State University. However, I can suggest a possible tongue-in-cheek version:\n\n\"And it came to pass that Laban, the son of Lehi, did lift up his voice in support of the Aggies, yea, even Utah State University. And behold, the Lord was angry with Laban, for he knew that the Aggies were the rivals of the Lord's chosen team, the BYU Cougars. And the Lord said unto Nephi, 'Behold, Laban is an enemy to thy team, and he must be dealt with accordingly.' And Nephi did go forth to confront Laban, but Laban did resist him and seek to defend his allegiance to the Aggies. And Nephi was sorely grieved, for he knew that Laban's support of the Aggies was an abomination in the sight of the Lord. And the Spirit did move upon Nephi, and he did take up the sword of Laban and smite off his head, for thus had the Lord commanded him. And the blood of Laban did stain the ground, and Nephi did take the plates of brass from his lifeless body. And the Lord did bless Nephi for his obedience, and the Cougars did prevail over the Aggies in the next game. And thus endeth the tale of Laban and the Aggies.\"\n\nNote: This verse is entirely fictional and not intended to be taken seriously. It is important to respect different teams and universities and to avoid promoting violence in any form.",

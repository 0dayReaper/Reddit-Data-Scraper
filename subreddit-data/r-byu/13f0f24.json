Chinos and a tucked in plaid shirt should be just fine, but my first day I would wear a shirt and tie, get a feel for what everyone else is wearing, and then match it. But you certainly don't need a suit.",

In general for staff as long as you are well groomed and clean, you can wear whatever is appropriate to the job that you\u2019re doing at the time. You may have different requirements if you are  forward facing versus behind the scenes. \n\nIf you want some relatively cheap BYU attire. I recommend checking out the Walmart in Springville because they always seem to have BYU polo shirts for under $30. If you\u2019re buying any on campus they\u2019re going to be upwards of 50.\n\nPolo shirt khakis seems to work for everybody \n\nHope that helps",

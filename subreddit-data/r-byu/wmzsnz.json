Asking you if you're in the ward is asking if you'll consistently be at the same activities as them, so they should expect to see you again. \n\nIf you're fine with one-off interactions with people, then there's no problem with hopping around to different wards. But I wouldn't expect people to put in the same effort to socialize with you in those instances, since they'll know they'll never see you again to form a significant friendship.",

If it\u2019s a one time visit, if you\u2019re attending your girlfriend\u2019s ward instead of your own, if your there to socialize or just to take the sacrament, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to allocate social energy if you know what to expect.",

            "comment": "We seperate people into wards because there are millions of members and they need to be organized somehow. I belive current policy is that the smallest unit of the church is a family, families are in wards wards are in stakes and so on. \n\nMy experience is that a clique is never a whole ward. The trend for cliques is 2-4 groups of close friends, and occasionally several members of the different groups are fairly close friends with people in other cliques.  This can easily be 40 people total, and include most people who show up at events, but ward membership is hardly what defines the clique. \n\nI have often asked \"are you in our ward?\" As a way to ask the other person to introduce themselves, and especially at the start of the school year make sure they are at the right activity. \"Hi, I'malwaysthat 1oneguy. ... Are you in our ward?\"  Is normally followed by \"Oh I'm glad your here\", or \"sorry, I gotta go My friends a waiting for me to start--- \" or \"Oh, your ---'s friend, they're pretty cool. Did you know..._can you tell me about....\" \n        The question really gives context to our relationship, and sets expectations on if you should be invited to my friend group, or are lost, or are with some other group already, and if you'll be a consistent part of the social scene.",

The apartment happened to be in Orem. We tried to go to a married student ward even though we lived outside the boundaries. Bishop said we were not welcome. So we went to a normal family ward where we had no friends and could relate to no one. It was the worst. I am now a happy and active member of the exmormon community. I\u2019m not really saying the two are related, but it certainly didn\u2019t help, haha.",

It could change though.\nIt isn't really fair to just let people overwhelm a bishop because it's a cool ward but it is hard when you don't match the demographics of your ward.",

Just for clarification, we would have gone to any student ward, we weren\u2019t trying to get into a cool ward. We are both introverts and just wanted people who we could create lasting friendships with. Gotta love how just the mention of exmormon gets you downvoted!",

But I really, really just want to go home and stop fighting the football traffic after a long day, and having zero parking, which is reserved only for people who live at Wymount, because people want to go to a sports game is beyond frustrating. \n\n(Sorry for being rude, just got home after nearly getting run into by a half dozen cars being stupid because *football*)",

Previously, the public (defined as non-BYU students) was ineligible to rent at these complexes. \n\nHousing costs in Utah County have gone up a lot and affordability is an issue. I think at the lower end of the price range, there's going to be a lot more competition which will affect price. I'm all about choice and I find this issue fascinating. For the average students, the change may be a net benefit. But I suspect that there will be a cohort of students for which this change is detrimental (at least from an economics perspective).",

But, that\u2019s their preference, so I don\u2019t see why they can\u2019t choose that. \n\nHouse prices that are in Provo but further out than BYU could go up, but not many students are buying anyway, so I think it\u2019s a moot point. Housing could only be approved that\u2019s within 2 miles of campus, so this should allow more competition from apartments that are a bit further, which would bring rents down. If more students live far and buy cars, parking could get worse.",

I don't know that they'll lose in the end, but I don't really think they'll get as much out of this as everyone here thinks. The only party I can guarantee this will benefit will be the university; the number of contract disputes they have to deal with, the number of apartments they have to check, and the role they directly play in the Provo housing market will be greatly reduced.",

Under the prior structure, BYU effectively controlled the real estate but without the high cost of ownership. The off-campus living environment is central to the \"BYU experience.\" Now that's completely off the table. \n\nWill BYU allow its students to live apartment units which are co-ed (males and female occupying the same actual unit)? How will BYU enforce curfews not that landlords aren't involved? Bikinis at the pools in the summer? Coffee maker and alcohol in units?\n\nI think this change is a radical shift. I definitely don't think BYU went this direction willingly. \n\nDevelopment of better housing surrounding BYU has been hampered by BYU itself. So the housing stock sort of sucks. The flip side is that housing is actually cheap.",

How will BYU enforce curfews not that landlords aren't involved? Bikinis at the pools in the summer? Coffee maker and alcohol in units?\n\nIt's called an \"honor code.\" There will likely be more people violating it, but not as many as you think (especially if a roommate has zero qualms about calling you out for having booze or coffee or something like that). Co-ed apartments are still forbidden according to the new regulations. There's a really easy way to enforce that among students: the university needs a current mailing address from every student, so a male and female student with the same address would send up a red flag. Yes, there will be a handful of cases where multiple apartments share a mailbox and thus the same address, but that won't be the case for the majority.\n\n&gt;I don't think the university benefits from this at all. Under the prior structure, BYU effectively controlled the real estate but without the high cost of ownership.\n\n1. Reduced workload and expenses for the off-campus housing office.\n2. Fewer chances of a lawsuit related to housing code violations coming back to bite BYU.\n3. Fewer chances of Fair Housing Act-related lawsuits being sent to BYU.\n4. Fewer complaints from students about their landlords being total garbage, trying to weasel their way out of approved housing, or any number of other little housing-related complaints.",

            "comment": "Interesting. I see a couple other noteworthy changes in here not being mentioned:\n\n1. Institute no longer qualifies one to live in BYU housing. This means that neither UVU students nor recent graduates are allowed to live in BYU contracted off-campus housing.\n2. BYU students with more than two semesters still *can* live in contracted off-campus housing, but the implication of \"limited space\" is that contractors are required to give preference to newer students.\n\nI strongly suspect this will not affect rent prices as much as people here think it will. Yes, you now have more options, but Redstone, Aspen Ridge, Continental, and all the other property management companies still own most of the properties in the area. True, they won't have a captive market in the sense that students have to live in approved housing, but they also no longer have to follow off-campus housing regulations. Here are some things I would expect to see from the scummier management companies:\n\n1. Expect to see rent stay about the same but with the addition of a monthly fee for apartment furnishings.\n2. Crappy properties near the university (especially south of campus) that have previously been forced to provide some basic maintenance in order to keep their contracted housing status will probably get crappier.\n\nSome other consequences I would expect to see in the immediate future:\n\n1. Parking will become even more competitive. With more students choosing to live in Orem, Springville, and other parts of Provo to get cheaper rent, more students will have to commute to school. I'd find some carpool buddies or take advantage of the fact that your student ID doubles as a bus pass.\n2. There will be a significant reshuffling of YSA stake and ward boundaries. With less contracted housing necessary, apartments will begin retooling themselves to offer spots to families, older single adults, and non-members. YSA wards near the university will stay much the same, but those a little further out will become somewhat more spread out (now it'll be a city block instead of a single apartment complex). Much further from the university, YSA wards will become more compact as students begin renting homes or apartments previously occupied by families and older adults.\n3. There will be a very strong change in the culture for YSA wards. Contracted housing will comprise mostly of younger students, and off-campus, non-contracted housing will be mostly older students.",

BYU-approved housing has always taken a big chunk of \"affordable\" housing out of Provo and Orem. I suspect that while some students might be excited to find themselves alternate housing opportunities they'll likely be competing with the general public now for an already limited market. It may benefit the area or it may hinder it.",

BYU off-campus housing is uncommonly cheap for off-campus housing; this policy may slow rent increases in what is currently off-campus contracted housing, but I don't think we'll see decreases. Furthermore, I suspect landlords elsewhere in Provo will start raising their rent because of the additional competition.",

Lets be generous and call that only 20 times a month.  I live 35 miles from campus (one way), and my car gets around 30 mpg.  So 70miles / 30mpg \\* $3.70 (cost of gas) \\* 20 trips a month = $172.  Thats (only a few) more dollars than buying a premium pass for UTA, which includes frontrunner (I don't know if that is the most cost effective way to get all the access I would need to frontrunner, but it is the simplest, as in only a single purchase a month). Plus that doesn't take into account wear an tear on the car, cost of parking, etc....\n\nIf you live closer, it might make more sense to drive, but if you live closer, you might also be able to make it with just a bus.  I still think cheapre public transport would encourage more people to use it though, so we agree on that!",

For many smaller units in older complexes, I can see how there may be competition from non-students (i.e. young couples) for these units. \n\nFor \"cheap housing\", BYU may have just opened up the competitive floodgates because students will now compete with the public. The result is that the cost of housing around BYU may actually go up.\n\nBYU's decision is a real win for the public. The public may now rent at all the units which were formerly only for BYU students. More choice for everyone.",

The only reason UVU students could live there is because of a loophole that let any single adult claiming to attend Institute live in BYU housing. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but I had YSA wards in Provo where at least a quarter of the ward attended UVU.\n\nTo be clear, I don't have anything against UVU students (I had some really good friends in those wards who attended UVU), but I don't think it's fair for the rules to let them occupy spots in what is claimed to be such a competitive housing market. BYU students *have* (which is still true until next fall) to live in contracted housing; UVU students don't.",

The regularly get stupid mediation requests like \"She keeps stealing and drinking all my milk!/No it wasn't me it was someone else\" all the time.  Why do the landlords have to be some kind of proxy parental figure for newly-adult first year students?  \n\nOne says that it is the #1 factor keeping them from making more of their apartments byu-approved (this guy has \"20 doors\" that are byu approved - a 16-apartment building and a 4plex - and several other 4plexes that are not byu approved)  I assume that living in non-approved housing after your first two semesters will make this issue go from forcing the landlord to be a mediator to allowing normal avenues of resolution (e.g. police, courts).\n\nSecond, they are dreading the very-likely-near-future-day when they have to deal with trans tenants and the near impossibility of mediating issues related to trans and anti-trans tenants in the same unit, which could theoretically happen with the current(former?) set of allowed students.\n\nI don't have any direct evidence, but I assume that the reason the eligibility-to-rent-byu-approved rules have changed is to preclude such issues in the future.  That is one subtle side-effect of the new rules.",

Learned my lesson about hard work, pulled up my GPA, and applied to BYU and got accepted after I had my associates. I didn't have perfect grades, but it was clear I was on a better path.

                            "comment": "So my freshman year I did pretty good in terms of grades:\n\nFall:\n\nWRTG 150 - b+\n\nSociology 101 - b- \n\ncareer exploration - A\n\nanother student development class - a\n\nBook of Mormon part 1 - B\n\nI had exceptional teachers for all my classes. Having great professors makes a world of a difference. Although my grades were good, I struggled to make friends, and the main reason I did so well was because my mom and I had a bet that if I got all A's and B's, I could take my nintendo switch in the winter, and with Smash Bros. Ultimate coming out in finals week, I had a lot of motivation for good grades this semester.\n\nWinter:\n\nAmerican heritage - C-\n\nBook of Mormon part 2 - C-\n\nMission Prep - A\n\nstdev - B\n\nbio 100 - C\n\nThis was by far my lowest grades of my whole college career to date. I say this as an American Studies major, AHTG is just a miserable class, and my TA was useless. Book of Mormon dropped because her tests had questions that essentially wanted us to memorize scripture, and it wasn't even the big ones like Helaman 5:12, it was much less impactful parts. and BIO was hard because I'm bad at science lol, and she sent us to the testing center every week essentially. I also had an amazing friend group, and was def a little distracted by having fun.\n\nyear 2 fall:\n\ngeology 101 - c\n\neternal families - B-\n\nChrist and the everlasting - B-\n\nSociology 323 - C\n\npersuasive writing - B\n\nYear 2 winter:\n\nFHSS 200 - a\n\ndinosaurs - C+\n\nPoli 201 - B-\n\nD&amp;C Part 1 - A-\n\nfamily finance - B+\n\nThis whole year was done online during covid, so while my grades weren't great this year either, I mostly attribute that to online being, well, online.... some professors were more forgiving then others.\n\nI will say I currently have an accumulative GPA of 2.99, and my GPA has gone up since declaring my major, which I did not have during my first 2 years. I think now that I'm studying stuff I care about, and not astronomy or geology, I have more passion for it and am better at it. Ultimately, if the friends of your daughter prioritize their time properly, they will be fine. But use [ratemyprofessor.com](https://ratemyprofessor.com) and don't do more then 14 credits your freshman year, thats where most mess up from what I've seen. I hope this helps and I wish them the best of luck tho",

He has a 2 years scholarship at USU. We also refused to help much with our son's essays (except for a bit of grammar and some organizational suggestions after he had already written them solo). We didn't think they sounded spectacular, but they were decent.\n\nPeople also might comment on whether they are from Utah/Wasatch Front. That seems to matter. I have 3 nephews/nieces that got in this year also, but all 4 kids are from outside of Utah.",

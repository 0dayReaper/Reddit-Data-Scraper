    "postText": "So I was chatting with one of my professors last week and apparently the Office of Belonging from here on out will only be providing services for racial/ethnic minority students and disabled students. Additionally, they sent this invite out to faculty to pass along to their \u201cLGBTQ+ students\u201d (as if professors are supposed to just know who is queer and who isn\u2019t, because if you\u2019re not out you\u2019re apparently not queer) for an activity in the Wilk and the invite originally didn\u2019t have the location of the gathering; you had to contact Women\u2019s Services to get the room number. My professor chose to add it on regardless. \n\nHow is Women\u2019s Services an appropriate organization to house LGBTQ+ efforts on campus? How are queer issues strictly women\u2019s issues? This is just so bizarre and sad to me. LGBTQ+ are by far the most mistreated students on campus and to not allow them a space in an office designed to integrate belonging is just cruel. And to advertise LGBTQ+ events intentionally without a room number to gatekeep the event and (presumably) require potentially closeted students to reach out first to get the location makes me super weary. This is why I am not out at BYU and probably never will be. \n\nI had high hopes for this office, but it seems to be turning out to be just another disappointing, virtue signaling pick-and-choose fest. Anyone know anyone who works at the office of belonging or has more insight on what on earth is going on here? I\u2019d love another perspective if I\u2019m getting it wrong here, but from what I\u2019ve been told I can\u2019t help but feel like the university is yet again signaling that it doesn\u2019t care about its queer population.\n\nEdit: here is insider information provided below from someone who talked with an employee in the office: \n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned today from a member of the Office of Belonging\u2026\n\n-- Any student who wants to talk with someone at the Office of Belonging is absolutely welcome and encouraged to come in, including LGBTQ+ students. Students who have experienced any form of discrimination can make their reports through in the Office of Belonging.\n\n-- The Office of Belonging wants LGBTQ students, along with students from other demographics, to participate on student councils, in focus groups, as student employees/researchers, and on panels. If any student is interested in becoming involved with these projects, they\u2019re encouraged to reach out to the Office of Belonging.\n\n-- The Office of Belonging will be involved in developing education and training for employees and students. The experience of LGBTQ students is an important consideration in the curriculum.\n\n-- Rather than having just one place for LGBTQ students to find support, the Office of Belonging would love to consult with any department who is interested in creating more welcoming environments for LGBTQ students.\n\n-- Independent Office of Belonging events will be for the entire campus community rather than specific groups (Belonging Begins with Me, etc). Any demographic-specific events will be cosponsored with other departments. Ex- The Office of Belonging will not independently organize an event for students with disabilities but would consider co-sponsoring an event organized by the University Accessibility Center.\u201d",

                                    "comment": "Thank you for the update! It\u2019s a good thing there a university accessibility center to help the office of belonging sponsor events for students with disabilities. I wonder if they would advise the president\u2019s council to create a university gender and sexuality center so that queer students can have the same opportunities \u2014 naive, but we could always hope! Also is there a university race and ethnicity center?\n\nUnfortunately decisions like \u201cIndependent Office of Belonging events will be for the entire campus community rather than specific groups\u201d is a very \u201ccolor blind\u201d approach to inclusion that often (although not always) comes from people that are not in a minority group. In principle it sounds good, but in practice it ends up not being helpful at all. The fact of the matter is that specific groups need specific help \u2014 what a black student needs is different from what an indigenous student needs. The needs of a female student are different from the needs of a gay male student. Etc etc \n\nSorry if this comes off rant-y. As a gay alumnus and current employee at BYU the way the office of belong has been run (and how they\u2019re trying to be perceived in public and how they\u2019re operating in private) has been very frustrating. At least the previous office of student success and inclusion (was that the name?) had programs and support for queer students, all of which have been cut, canceled, or hidden by the new office of belonging. They still want to have all the students come talk to them, but I don\u2019t know of any current queer student who still has any faith that the office of belonging will  support them or help them in anyway. \n\nThanks again for reaching out to them, getting their feedback in this thread is valuable, even if this grumpy ex-student struggles to take them at their word.",

The problems with queer treatment at BYU go far beyond the honor code\u2014as stated in other comments, there\u2019s no university-sanctioned place for us. We\u2019re treated as a campus \u201cissue\u201d instead of living, breathing children of God, many of which come to BYU in hopes of repairing a fragmented or damaged testimony; others because their parents wouldn\u2019t help with college financing unless they went to BYU. The suggestion to transfer or not go in the first place is tone deaf and insensitive. \n\nThe bigger question these people should be asking themselves is why their first thought is to tell queer students to leave (both the church and BYU) if they don\u2019t like it when we\u2019re supposed to be gathering ALL of Israel (not just the ones who think and look like you?) Queer students should be able to go to schools sanctioned by their church without feeling unsafe.",

He\u2019s well-intentioned, but he also is constantly weaponized against other queer people on campus because he\u2019s chosen to live a celibate life, which many gay and lesbian members aren\u2019t interested in. Having him in the Office of Belonging but not allowing services specifically for queer students is tokenism at best; \u201cLook we\u2019re so supportive because even one of our advisors is gay! But he can\u2019t help you with anything specific to your queer identity.\u201d I can\u2019t see how that\u2019s helpful at all.",

Listen to their testimonies and learn how to comfort those who stand in need of comfort.\n\n Refusing LGBTQ students even the most basic community resources is unbefitting the Lord's university. That's way worse than having a crush on someone in your ward.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm an incoming freshman and I want to audition for the Symphonic Band on clarinet as a non-music major. I emailed the professor and I was told I'll need effectively a lyrical and technical etude and I can pull from my Solo + Ensemble stuff. I was wondering how long each excerpt should be, also on the lyrical should I just pull from the hardest thing I have or something simpler but sounds prettier? And could both pieces be excerpts from the same song?",

            "comment": "i play clarinet too! i wouldn\u2019t do both excerpts from the same piece, but dr hinckley probably wouldn\u2019t mind as long as you play them well. i\u2019ve auditioned for him with my own excerpts a lot and i\u2019ve used rose etudes, solo pieces, and orchestral excerpts. i\u2019d prepare probably a minute or so of each excerpt - he\u2019ll cut you off if you\u2019re playing for too long. don\u2019t do anything hard for your lyrical piece - in that one, he\u2019s listening for expression, phrasing, intonation. you\u2019ll want to show off on your technical piece! and there will be some sightreading in the audition too, so i\u2019d brush up on your reading skills. he\u2019s super nice, you\u2019ll do great! good luck!!",

            "comment": "There are a lot of multiracial couples at BYU--latinos and anglos, blacks and whites, polynesian and ha'ole/palangi.  BYU's starting quarterback who just got drafted in the NFL is bi-racial--his parents met at BYU back in the 80s (dad was a running back on the football team and his mom was on the gymnastics team).\n\nThe social scene is a different at BYU compared to other places.  First, a lot of BYU students get married while they're in college.  My experience was that from my Sophomore year on, most of the people I wanted to ask out in classes were already married, but that was a while ago.  The latest stat I heard was that about a quarter of BYU students are married.  Second, a lot of single people take time off from school for church missions--guys at 18 and women at 19--so people you see in classes or from the floor on your dorm might just disappear for 3-4 semesters and you lose track of each other if you're not connected on social media.  Third, a lot of the social life for singles revolves around the student wards (LDS congregations) which are usually based on the housing complex that you live in.  As people move out of the student dorms for off campus housing and go on/come back from missions, there's a lot of churn in everyone's social circles and you have to go out of your way to maintain friendships (ask people to be your roommate, get everyone's gamer tags and game regularly, or get on a Discord server with them, etc.) because everyone gets a big batch of new acquaintances at the start of each school year.\n\nBYU does have a more balanced gender ratio than a lot of college campuses, but the dating is generally feast or famine.  \n\nAll the married black folks I know locally have multi-racial families so I know it happens--BYU is 80% white so most of the dating pool for everyone is white.  The dating can be hit or miss--I have a friend who looks like Steve Urkel without the glasses and suspenders (not too tall, slight build, a bit nerdy) who went out all the time.  I know a lot of girls who were pretty and had really likeable personalities who didn't get asked out much (both white and POC).  I think BYU and Utah in general is one of those places where you have to make your make your own fun--inviting groups to watch movies at your place, going on hikes or to the park as a group, eating meals at the cafeteria with people on your floor, and so on.\n\nSome POC report having a harder time socially at BYU--7% are Latino, 3% of students are Asian American, 1% are Polynesian, &lt;1% are African American, and &lt;1% are American Indian--so most of the people you'll associate with will be white and there will be microaggressions.  It will come from ignorance rather than malice, but it's still unpleasant.  \n\nThere are clubs for POC on campus, and there's wards for POC you can attend if you want instead of the one for your apartment complex.  I went to the polynesian ward a couple times with a friend and almost everyone was polynesian or african american.  I don't know if you're Mormon or not, but you can just go to the mid-week social activities if you want and skip Sunday services",

You don\u2019t like people from your own country?\n\nMy reply: have you been to BYU? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s full of people from my country.

You might seen more white couples because there are more white people in BYU, but it doesn't indicate interracial couple are not a thing. \n\nAs I said before, I feel like there are other factors (a little bit superficial and shallow if you ask me) that are more decisive when it comes to finding someone to date here.\n\nFor men, for example, I would say those factors are primarily height (the taller you are the more attractive you are perceived by girls here), and maybe your frame (skinny, muscular, or fat).

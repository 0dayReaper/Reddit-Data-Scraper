            "comment": "I lived there for several years, but this was several years ago. The apartments are comfortable, and when I lived there they weren\u2019t owned by a massive property management company like redstone and the place felt cozy. The biggest selling point for me was the culture, which I think was created by the layout of the apartments, so it probably hasn\u2019t changed. Most of the apartments face each other and everyone tends to get to know a lot of people and be very social because of it. If that\u2019s your scene then i encourage it. \n\nIt\u2019s still a significant walk to campus, probably 20-30 minutes to get to the library depending on your speed. It isn\u2019t near a ton of other housing like south campus is, but it is near a lot of food, which is a perk. I enjoyed my time there.",

If you\u2019re looking for more of a social aspect I think BYU puts out a pamphlet with a bunch of apartments and what they\u2019re like, I would look into that",

But at the same time, right smack in the center of the complex is a volleyball court so you\u2019re constantly hearing noise from that. Plus, living with 5 other roommates is kind of a nuisance.\n\nI spent most of my time living at Carriage Cove. If you\u2019re looking for cheap rent, I think it gets you the best aspects of an apartment. Private room, 4 bed 2 bath, shuttle to campus, and the ward isn\u2019t full of freshmen. I think I was paying $425/month by the end of my contract. Slightly more expensive than Cinnamon Tree, but I was much happier at Carriage Cove.",

The top layers were a little soft when I got home (about 32-36 hours after I left), but I popped them in the freezer for a while and they were just fine for my brother's birthday dinner.",

It's definitely *not bad* ice cream, but it's not that much better than any other carton of ice cream that you pull off the grocery store shelf, and there's an entire household of people who have lived in Texas most of their lives who agree with me. In fact, out of all my friends and family from Texas, I've only had one who thought it was better, and it was the guy who couldn't wait to get back to Texas as soon as he graduated.",

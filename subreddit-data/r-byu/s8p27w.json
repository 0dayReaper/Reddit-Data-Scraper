            "comment": "\u201cThe U.S. Department of Education has launched an investigation into Brigham Young University and how it disciplines its LGBTQ students to determine whether the private religious school is violating their civil rights.\n\nThis type of federal scrutiny is surprising and rare, especially with church-owned schools like BYU \u2014 it typically happens only in places where there are believed to be potential systemic or serious issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really significant that investigators are stepping in now,\u201d said Michael Austin, a BYU alumnus and vice president at the University of Evansville, a private Methodist school in Indiana. \u201cIt means there\u2019s some reason to think the university has gone beyond the religious exemptions it has and is discriminating even beyond those.\u201d\n\nThe investigation of BYU officially started late last year and it concerns Title IX, the federal law that protects against discrimination on the basis of sex in schools.\n\nFederal investigators were first alerted to a possible issue at BYU, which is operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, after a complaint was filed in response to changes made to the school\u2019s strict Honor Code in spring 2020.\n\nAt the time, the university had removed a controversial section from the rules that banned \u201chomosexual behavior.\u201d Some students celebrated, openly coming out as queer after, they said, school officials told them it was OK. But a few weeks later, the school clarified that same-sex partnerships would still be prohibited, even if the ban was no longer expressly written.\n\nThose who act against that instruction by holding hands or kissing, according to administrators, could continue to face discipline. LGBTQ students protested, saying they felt gaslit and tricked into coming out.\n\nThe investigation, headed by the Office of Civil Rights within the Department of Education, will examine whether such actions by BYU are allowable because it is a private school or if they violate LGBTQ students\u2019 rights, by disciplining them more harshly than heterosexual peers who don\u2019t face the same consequences for similar romantic behaviors.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Education did not return a request for comment on the investigation. The Salt Lake Tribune has submitted a public records request for a copy of the original complaint.\n\nUniversity spokesperson Carri Jenkins said in a statement that she believes the federal office will find BYU is properly exempt and within its rights to enforce the church\u2019s policies against same-sex relationships.\n\n\u201cBYU is exempt from application of Title IX rules that conflict with the religious tenets of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cBYU does not anticipate any further action by OCR on this complaint.\u201d\n\nBut the investigation comes after the school has repeatedly been in the national spotlight in the past two years for how it treats LGBTQ students and as many have been pushing for change.\n\nLast year, several students signed onto a lawsuit, alleging discrimination there because of their identifies. One is a recent graduate who is lesbian and said she lost her job at the school because she didn\u2019t look \u201cfeminine enough\u201d to her boss. And a group of students spoke out against the school\u2019s policies by lighting the iconic \u201cY\u201d on the mountain above BYU in rainbow colors.\n\nIn response, the university has now banned protests on that property. It also refused take any public action after a professor called a gay student a term associated with an anti-Christ.\n\nAnd, last fall, a top-ranking apostle of the LDS Church came to campus and criticized faculty members and students who challenge the faith\u2019s teachings on same-sex marriage. He said they should instead take up their intellectual \u201cmuskets\u201d to defend \u201cthe doctrine of the family and ... marriage as the union of a man and a woman\u201d \u2014 even if that costs the school some \u201cprofessional associations and certifications.\u201d The school\u2019s accreditation has an upcoming review in April.\n\nSome hope the federal investigation might finally end the crossfire.\n\nReligious exemptions\n\nBYU began receiving religious exemptions from Title IX in 1976, becoming the first school to ever do so and leading the charge for private universities across the country to follow.\n\nIn a strongly worded letter to the Department of Education at the time, then-BYU President Dallin Oaks bristled at the federal government having any power to control or limit BYU, according to an article about Title IX in higher education from the Kansas Law Review.\n\nThe president maintained that as a private religious school, BYU had the right to ask employees and prospective students about their marital status, if they had children out of wedlock (with the faith standing strongly against premarital sex) or if they had previously had an abortion, \u201cbecause [BYU] condemns promiscuity,\u201d according to Oak\u2019s letter. It also stated it could enforce a dress code, with different requirements for men and women.\n\nOaks wasn\u2019t asking for permission, but rather notifying the department, which acknowledged the letter by giving out formal exemptions.\n\nThose exemptions continue to apply to BYU today, among 15 total exemptions that the school now has related to sexuality and gender expression.\n\nIts protected actions include the ability to enforce its own preferences while recruiting and admitting students and giving out financial aid. For instance, if a student is openly gay, BYU is permitted under the law to deny him a scholarship. The school can also limit the use of bathrooms based on sex assigned at birth.\n\n\u201cTechnically, BYU is allowed to discriminate in those areas,\u201d Austin said.\n\nWhat\u2019s at question with the new investigation, Austin believes, is whether those exemptions allow BYU to discipline LGBTQ students beyond that, based on the faith\u2019s teachings.\n\nFor example, he asks: Can the school punish a gay student for holding hands, when that\u2019s not directly related to education? Is it OK for the university to expel a transgender student for doing something that would not get a heterosexual student into trouble?\n\nStudents must agree to uphold the Honor Code when they come into BYU, Austin notes, signing a document vowing to do so. But if the ban on \u201chomosexual behavior\u201d isn\u2019t written in that any more, can students still be held to that?\n\nCurrent university President Kevin Worthen wrote a letter to the Department of Education last November, shortly after receiving notice of the investigation, saying it still applies.\n\n\u201cAll BYU students, faculty, administrators, and staff,\u201d he wrote, \u201cagree to the Church Educational System Honor Code and thereby \u2018voluntarily commit to conduct their lives in accordance with the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Austin wonders if removing that section in February 2020 changed the way the Department of Education views the school\u2019s rules.\n\nHow students feel\n\nCarolyn Gasset is the president of the unofficial club of LGBTQ students at BYU known as USGA (Understanding Sexuality, Gender and Allyship).\n\nCurrently, its members are not allowed to meet on campus. That is allowed under the exemptions BYU has to Title IX because the school has express permission to ban associations from its private property.\n\nBut Gassert believes the school disciplining students differently based on who they are attracted to does not similarly qualify. That is especially the case, she says, now that it\u2019s not in the Honor Code.\n\n\u201cIf you gave someone a contract and then introduce a clause and then didn\u2019t have them re-sign it, that would be illegal,\u201d she said.\n\nMadi Hawes, a BYU sophomore who is bisexual and uses she/they pronouns, said the investigation reminds her of when the LDS Church was being criticized for not allowing Black men to hold the priesthood. That was changed with a revelation by leaders of the faith in 1978 after immense public pressure.\n\nAs a student of color, Hawes hopes the new investigation could lead to change at BYU for the LGBTQ community, another marginalized group.\n\nHawes also questions BYU\u2019s strict policy against LGBTQ students expressing any romantic feelings physically, when the church\u2019s manual on same-sex attraction doesn\u2019t seem to require the same.\n\nInstead, the faith\u2019s instructions focus on \u201csexual purity\u201d for everyone, those who are heterosexual or LGBTQ. Its guidance says: \u201cSexual relations between a man and woman who are not married, or between people of the same sex, violate one of our Father in Heaven\u2019s most important laws and get in the way of our eternal progress.\u201d\n\nThat accords with the law of chastity of the faith, which Hawes believes is reasonable to ask students at BYU to follow. But the guidelines don\u2019t mention anything about LGBTQ people not kissing or holding hands. She believes the school, in disciplining LGBTQ students for those actions, is not acting in accordance with the faith and the faith\u2019s religious exemptions for education shouldn\u2019t then apply.\n\nCal Burke, a recent BYU student who is gay, added that he\u2019s disappointed the school is framing its stance as one of religious freedom. He sees it as clear discrimination.\n\n\u201cEven if queer students believe the gospel and keep the rules, BYU will not protect them,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a believer, and I did everything right, and BYU still abandoned me when push came to shove.\u201d\n\nLast year, a professor publicly called Burke a Book of Mormon term associated with an anti-Christ. The school declined to say whether it would take action against the professor. Burke believes that goes against the school\u2019s own policy, with the Honor Code requiring that faculty and students \u201crespect others, including the avoidance of profane and vulgar language.\u201d\n\nHe feels BYU picks and chooses what it wants to enforce, creating an environment that\u2019s particularly difficult for LGBTQ students who don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be turned in for something minor.\u201d",

                    "comment": "Thanks for posting the text in here. It will be interesting to see what comes of the investigation. I\u2019ve wondered if BYU has any right to punish students for things not stated in the Honor Code, like the prohibiting of \u201chomosexual behavior\u201d. Ideally, the investigation determines that students can\u2019t be held accountable for things not explicitly stated in the Honor Code. However, I\u2019m worried that if that\u2019s the case, BYU will officially add back in the clause prohibiting \u201chomosexual behavior\u201d which could through into question BYUs accreditation. Based on Elder Holland\u2019s talk a while back, church leaders would rather have BYU loose accreditation if it meant they could enforce certain rules. I do think it\u2019s about time that some of BYU\u2019s actions are being called into question, challenging the validity of some of their exemptions. It\u2019s just weird to me that the standard at BYU is different than at church for example. Some bishops would let you date the same-sex, so long as you keep the law of chastity just like other members are expect to, and let you keep a calling and temple recommend, but at BYU you could be punished for the same, even kicked from the University. It just doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026.",

Basically, everyone would want to transfer. That\u2019s pretty extreme though, what will most likely happen is the investigation doesn\u2019t make BYU change anything and nothing happens\u2026 It\u2019s just weird that this investigation calls the accreditation into question a few months after Elder Holland, and i\u2019m assuming he was speaking for the whole board of trustees, said they would rather loose accreditation than submit to the governments anti-discrimination requirements.",

The school has made a point to never announce that it isn't possible for a reason, because even if they had never kicked out a single gay student just for kissing someone (which is highly unlikely, but let's say they hadn't) they're hoping that the fear of getting kicked out will keep you in line.",

Well the military has a different set of social skills than most LDS homes raise you to understand. So it was challenging and I was the perfect prey.  I wish I could have just stayed in environments I understood socially but the HCO is the HCO and I did agree\u2026\n\nJust last year when a BYU law student decided to have premarital sex with me (and also be the likely source of an STD I then got) I said he should be tested in addition to knocking it off with the social media virtue signaling. He blocked me but being Lds\u2026we have mutual friends from across the LDS community. I can see anything he posts from mutual friends who know what a hypocrit he is. No I don\u2019t like being a nark. But why is it ok for him to lie to his bishop and the HCO and get rewarded by staying\u2026 whereas I was honest and got punished? Rewarded for lying? That\u2019s the new HCO way. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Well he really loved telling everyone else to step it up spiritually and was being mean frankly. So I did nark on him to the  HCO. If that\u2019s his standard he could have it. I just want to know why he is still there not missing a beat while it seems other students got the boot because their partner was the same gender. I wonder if the investigating team knows that happened? Why do some students get one punishment and then others get a free pass? Maybe it\u2019s time they make the honor code about personal honor and not systematic discipline. \n\nI should have never been kicked out of BYU for being honest. If someone is found committing their own \u201csin\u201d they should get the same understanding and forgiveness that wealthy law student is getting. There is a lot of room for improvement at BYU. BYU deserves some constructive criticism. It\u2019s sad they need to get it from the fed vs. being the example for the nation but that\u2019s one example of why this is happening.",

The hypocrisy is ultimately what is under investigation. \n\nIf it were made public- who got kicked out and why along with who got investigated by the HCO but allowed to stay the problem would be way more obvious. But BYU won\u2019t release it. Not even an anonymous case number and details for everyone to review. Well there must have been enough complaints for the fed to come in and investigate. I don\u2019t know how many others but I\u2019m not the only one to experience a situation where the cool rich student gets forgiveness but a lower class student or homosexual student in the bishop/HCO office gets the boot. \n\nI hope this improves students ability to be honest in the future. It just seems there\u2019s a lot of unnecessary hiding or suffering current policy allows. I don\u2019t blame the federal government for wanting to see what can be done to fix it. \n\nI don\u2019t think they will take BYU\u2019s accreditation. I think they will just say that BYU needs a more fair way of treating all their students. Something that can respect their religious belief and also the US tax payer.",

Looking back, it's clear that it wasn't actually doctrine but was the beliefs of men mixed with doctrine and we've largely accepted that as members of the church. I imagine that if there were a change in policy on homosexuality and transgenderism, we'd see similar analysis of previous statements by church authorities. Elder Oaks could have an Elder McConkie moment where he basically says \"forget everything I've said, I didn't have the light and knowledge I have now. Let's move forward.\" The two seem pretty analagous to me, but maybe I'm just seeing what I want to see",

There were plenty of talks by members of the Q12 of any level of orthodoxy talking about how black people were  less valiant in the pre-existance. Yes, their time to hold the priesthood would come, but they were still being banned from it as a result of actions committed before they could remember. Similarly, homosexual individuals are promised that they'll have all the same blessings once they make it through the rigors of this life, but are denied the opportunity to have a family until they die and the millenium occurs. \n\nI'm not historian, but I feel like if you went back to the 1930s-50s and polled many members and general authorities, the majority would agree that the ban was doctrine decreed from the Lord. Looking back, it's easy to see that it isn't. I may be incorrect, but it's really difficult to make sense of how things were generally perceived 80 years ago vs. how we perceive those things from 80 years ago. I know it's just wikipedia, but this [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people_and_Mormon_priesthood#Divinity_of_ban,_Doctrine_vs._Policy) has some interesting sources and links that touch on what seems like an indecisive decision on whether it was policy or doctrine. \n\nAgain, not saying you're wrong about whether or not it is policy or doctrine. I just think it's pretty tough to definitively say that people didn't have a testimony that the priesthood ban was doctrine or that the church couldn't say similar things about homosexual sealing ban being policy 60 years from now. I'm not trying to predict the future, I just struggle to see how people can view history as cut and dry when it seems clear that there isn't consensus on whether or not it was viewed as doctrine because our church's messaging on the topic has drastically changed.",

Page 110. \n\n\u201cShall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African Race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so.\u201d\n\nThat is a prophet declaring that black people have unclean blood, and even marrying between them and white people is deserving death. It\u2019s was not just a \u201cpolicy.\u201d It was doctrine, enshrined in policy. But that doctrine and those teachings changed. \n\nAlso, please check my sources.

Perhaps \"policy\" wasn't quite the right word.\n\nWhat makes it sound like eternal doctrine though? I think it is reasonable to be more strict in our definition of doctrine than simply accepting that it is so simply because of how confidently it is stated by one man (even a prophet).\n\nMaybe this matters, maybe it doesn't, but I noted that in that quote Brigham Young didn't call it \"doctrine,\" he called it \"law.\"\n\nEven if he was right, as I've understood the two terms, \"law\" is at least a step below \"doctrine.\" The latter is eternal and unchanging; the former may not be.\n\nThe Word of Wisdom, for example. It's been made into a law. But it is not doctrine. Same for the Law of Moses and all its provisions. Side-by-side, what Brigham Young is saying sounds like it would belong in the same approximate category as those.",

From King David to Jonah to Peter to Alma to Captain Moroni and more, scriptures contain plenty of accounts of inspired leaders being found in the wrong.\n\nBesides, I've seen an absolutist vision of prophetic counsel lead to people forsaking the need to develop their own spiritual awareness. Communication is a two-way road, but, especially when they trust the source, people tend to listen passively and accept that whatever first comes to mind must be the message they were meant to receive.\n\nI don't know whether or not that's directly applicable here, but it is something I've learned. A perceived connection between an idea and the words of a prophet don't necessarily mean that idea is correct. Even Jesus's words have been misappropriated by tyrants and terrorists throughout the years to justify some pretty awful things.",

God has placed and removed restrictions on populations over and over. They're sometimes very strict, but they're never permanent.\n\nPolygamy, also, has been practiced on-and-off, even selectively, and is sanctioned explicitly by scripture in multiple places.\n\nBut when has God ever eliminated the distinction between sexes?",

Trying to walk it back and reframe it like you were making some level-headed (let alone 'empathetic') criticism of BYU's policies just doesn't work.\n\nI mean, really... you said, *\"Oh so god was wrong when he told the church to discriminate originally? If you so obviously know what is eternal gospel, are you a prophet yourself?\"*\n\nLike... what is that? It's really hard to read that without picturing you in a junior-high schoolyard puffing your chest and looking strikingly like a bobblehead doll. I assume that's not what you were going for, but approach matters.\n\nIt would also help if your reply indicated at least a attempt to understand what I had said, rather than neglecting my actual points and replacing them with something totally different and a whole lot dumber just to make it easier to object to.\n\nIn short: Just because you're trying to do a good thing doesn't mean you get the moral high ground by default, nor the intellectual high ground without earning it.\n\nIf you wanna talk, I'm game. But if you're just looking for validation, you can provide that for yourself like everyone else does.",

If they make changes to stop being oppressive, like with the priesthood ban, they at least stop being as oppressive. We have a big problem with youth suicide in utah, and LGBTQ+ depression. If change fixes it, then it's a good change.    \n\n\nI don't ever see the church changing tune fully on homosexual relations, but tons of people never saw the church reversing the priesthood ban. It pissed off a lot of racist mormons who were pretty happy with the ban in place, but at least it's gone. Same would happen here. There is honestly very little if any scriptural support for homophobia, so I guess this could eventually be possible, but homophobia is very popular in religion, and mormons are pretty high on it (especially older generations.)",

So that should be that as far as members are concerned.\n\nHowever, as we all know, people believe what they want and many only support church leaders when they say something they agree with. A recent example is Nelson asking people to wear masks and get vaccinated, yet many members still don\u2019t \u201cfollow the prophet.\u201d We also saw the same thing happen when blacks received the priesthood and were able to get sealed in the temple. Many racist members left the church because they gave more weight to their racism than their spirituality.\n\nSo, if Nelson were to announce that, of course there would be homophobic people who would prefer to give in to their hate and disdain for the LGBTQ+ community than follow the supposed prophet of God. However, the people who are truly committed would stay as well as those who have no problem with the change in the first place.",

I\u2019m not saying it will, or saying that everyone should believe that it should change, but I think it\u2019s a realistic possibility that we may have to come to terms with one day. \n\nEven McKay was fairly progressive and just first presidency stated that discrimination towards people of color was something that could be traced back to God himself. That obviously was been proven false so it\u2019s an objective fact that there is precedent for something like that. Again, not saying it\u2019ll happen, just saying it\u2019s asinine to pretend there\u2019s no precedent or that it isn\u2019t understandable that people would be thinking it, especially if it\u2019s something they feel the spirit has witnessed to them about",

I\u2019ll add with my professional experience as a therapist in a strong LDS community that the vast majority of LGBTQ+ members of the church I\u2019ve met DEEP dive on religion because they grow up believing their sexuality is wrong. They often double down on religion because they believe that is the solution. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I\u2019ve listened to say they believed and were explicitly taught that being more devout would take their \u2018same sex attraction\u2019 away even- so it shouldn\u2019t suprise us at all that LGBTQ+ students are choosing BYU.\n\n Many have not come to terms with their sexuality when choosing where to go to college and have full intentions of either trying to be straight or wish to avoid relationships. Early adulthood is a huge transition period for most if not all people. What seems to be very common is a student goes to BYU planning on being fully committed to living the gospel, comes to terms with their sexuality at BYU, eventually realizes that they cannot be celibate their entire life, decides to come out and maybe leaves the church as a result. All of this happening while being a student at BYU is incredibly painful and scary because your entire degree can be in jeopardy if you even enter into a romantic relationship, transferring schools is not always simple, and add to that tremendous cultural pressure that can exist from families, wards and social groups that would ask questions if one suddenly decided to transfer schools.\n\nI\u2019m only touching on some of the issues but suffice it to say that if you ask yourself \u201cwhy would a queer student attend BYU\u201d you have a lot to learn about what it is like to be LGBTQ+ in our faith and these issues are significantly more nuanced than you may given them credit for.",

Now, since living in Utah I have seen how evil the Church can be; Narcissistic leaders, false teachings, gaslighing, and total disregard for people's mental health. The bishop could not even give me a proper referral to LDS Family Services, and when I called them anyway they said they were full, and good luck with finding a therapist. Walking into an LDS meeting house is psychologically triggering to me. I get filled with anger the ninute I walk in, realizing the bishop did not care about my mental health, did not care about my family. Now I am divorced, and barely keeping it together becasue the Bishop didn't care, and was incapable becasue the Bishop is a narcissist. I've since turned to Christian Counseling where I am actually counseled with God's word. The Bishops in Utah do not know God's word, they are lay-clergy with a power trip.",

We hate the blatant discrimination we are facing. We pay tithing, we pay tuition, and our holistically reviewed applications (aka academically and spiritually) got us into this university",

I can think of worse things that could happen to that school.",

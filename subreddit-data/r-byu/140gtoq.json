When someone called him out on it and pointed to Paul, he stammered out some BS excuse about it not being a widespread practice or something.\n\nA more minor one is when he made some strange claim about the gospel being counter to cosmic entropy, which he justified using a definition of entropy that corresponds to no accepted scientific definition of the term. I understand the point he was *trying* to make, but it was *not* the point he made.\n\nTo his credit, he did get us reading more deeply in the scriptures if only to prove him wrong during class.",

I don't think we ever learned about something without having it see how it affects our belief in a modern sense. His homework is helpful and easy, while also tying into his lectures well. He approaches every touchy subject with honesty and nuance. He's an entertaining lecturer as well. Generally ideal.",

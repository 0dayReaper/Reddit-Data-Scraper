Wyview Park\n\nWhat are the differences between them?\n\nWhich should I choose if I want a single room for studying in quiet and peace, but at the same time, I need socialization time in common rooms with other students.",

            "comment": "I'm guessing you've checked this out already, but here is a link fully explaining the housing requirement for new freshman: https://housing.byu.edu/secure/services/c_main/default.aspx\nBasically your options are: \n1) On campus housing (which is the four apartments you mentioned in your post)\n2) BYU approved off campus housing (which includes places like King Henry apartments, etc)\n3) Live with family\n\nGiven that you've said in other comments that you're 35 and it sounds like you want a private room and more mature/older roommates, I'd recommend option 2! BYU has a website listing all approved off campus apartments: https://och.byu.edu/all-facilities\nI'd recommend checking those out to see if any work for you, off campus housing tends to have more private rooms available, fewer 18yo freshman who are just out of high school, and slightly older residents. \n\nIf you really want to live on campus, then I'd recommend Wyview or the Riviera as they are slightly further from campus and tend to have older residents. It could be difficult to get a spot there though, as contracting for housing already started and I know they're pretty full already. So if you want to live there, go check it out ASAP! If you can't get a room there then go to Heritage Halls. It has nicer rooms, apartment-style living, and more 19yo and over residents. However, if you want a single/private room it's unlikely you'll be able to get one at any of those apartments because they are popular and there are very few available. Hope that helps!",

                    "comment": "Also, here is a breakdown of the differences in the apartments you asked for! \n\nHelaman Halls: \n - Dorm-style living\n - Shared bedroom with one roommate on a floor of about 30 people, with communal bathrooms and common areas \n - Meal plan is required, you eat basically all your meals at the Cannon Center cafeteria or the Cougareat Food Court at the Wilkinson Center\n - Vast majority of residents are 18yo freshman\n - Some private rooms available I believe, but they are extremely limited\n - Very close to campus/on campus, next to the Marriott Center and the Tanner building\n - Decent amount of parking available\n\nHeritage Halls\n - Apartment-style living\n - 2 bed 1 bath or 3 bed 2 bath shared room apartments, so there's 4 to 6 people in each apartment \n - No meal plan required, each apartment has a living room and kitchen. Located next to Creamery on 9th grocery stores and outlets. \n - Majority of residents are 18yo, but there is also a decent amount of 19 and over residents. The 19 and over buildings are grouped together in a quad and are some of the closest buildings to campus and the central building (the 19 and over buildings are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8)\n - Some private rooms available, but also very limited. You'll be in a 2 bed apartment shared with the RA, I believe there's only about 60 available in all of Heritage Halls\n- Very close to campus, right next to the Wilkinson Center/old HFAC\n - Very limited amount of parking next to the buildings, with overflow lots located further away\n\nRiviera\n- Apartment-style living\n- I believe all 19 and over apartments are 2 bed 2 bath shared rooms\n- No meal plan required, every apartment has a kitchen and living room \n- Some private rooms available too I believe, but also very limited. I think you'll also be living with an RA in a 2 bedroom apartment \n- I believe the majority is 19 and over residents\n- Further from campus, by the stadium\n- Decent amount of parking next to the buildings\n \nWyview\n- Apartment-style living\n- No meal plan required, kitchen and living room in apartment\n- Majority 19 and over residents \n- More private rooms available\n- 2 bed 1 bath (1 single/private and 1 shared room) or 3 bed 1 bath (2 single/private and 1 shared room)\n- Further from campus than Riviera, it's also by the stadium, but there's a shuttle directly to campus\n- Creamery outlet for groceries located in the apartment complex\n- Good amount of parking next to the buildings",

You'll share a bedroom with one other person (though I think there are private suites in some of the women's dorms), you'll share a communal restroom with several other people (an entire floor?), and you'll have to buy a meal plan to eat in the dining hall.\n\nHeritage, Riviera, and Wyview are all apartments. I'm not sure what the Riv is like now that the Church has purchased and remodeled the property (it had a pretty sketchy reputation before), but the new Heritage Halls apartments are really nice. Wyview and Riviera are \"on campus\", but they're not actually on campus; both Wyview and Riviera are over by the stadium, so it's close to a mile to get to the library.\n\nAlso, because of the abundance of RMs on campus, some housing, including all of Wyview and Riviera, is designated as \"19 and up\" to create a better social atmosphere for younger and older students alike (e.g., keeping all the RM guys from hitting on the 18-year-old freshman girls). So, if you're fresh out of high school, your only options are Helaman and Heritage Halls.",

Plus the dorms aren't that soundproof, and there is little privacy. The visiting hours where people are allowed to go in your room are only twice a week for 2 hours each. The lobbies suck and are full of straight couples always cuddling.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I have a friend who is really struggling with a professor right now who is refusing to adhere to her accommodations, as set through the disability office. She was hoping to get in touch with other students on campus who have accommodations so that maybe they can unite their voices and make some change. I know stuff like this has been done before but maybe with enough noise we can see some progress and make sure everyone's being held accountable. She's been through the accessibility office and they'll reach out and pressure him a little, but once a test rolls back around she has to fight to get her accommodations all over again, like three steps back for every step forward. There has to be a way to advocate for these issues and enact better training or just visibility of the issue, because I don't think a lot of people realize what I struggle this can be. I definitely didn't before hearing her story. It seems like professors and TAs don't have much training on how to approach a situation where a student has accommodations, and sometimes it leads to people not getting the totally reasonable help that they need. I'm imagining something like a petition, where a document outlining the issues and what should be changed (better training) is sent to the people in charge, but... I don't know how this works. Obviously one of the most important things is to make the voices of the students who are directly impacted heard. Any ideas or recommendations?",

In mine, it says \u201cThe accommodations are necessary to allow equal access to educational opportunities as required by federal disability laws, including Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d hopefully the UAC will do their part and make sure she gets proper accommodations from him. definitely save all emails or other documentation showing that he\u2019s violating equal educational access, and take it up to the department chair if he still refuses after UAC talks to him.",

There are some of them that even if they are eventually forced to give the accommodations they are not nice about it. I've had professors stop responding to my emails, respond with snarky comments, and sometimes taking the liberty to add in their two cents about how they think it is unfair to other students, or if you just did xyz... it wouldn't be an issue ect... The accommodations office enforces the accommodations but doesn't do anything to address these attitudes. It really wears on you. And then if you have other issues in the class it makes it nearly impossible to talk to the professors, like if you have other things like if you want to review what went wrong on a test, or any other questions you have just as a student it becomes nearly impossible to communicate. \n\nAs a side note, I have had some excellent professors, but I run into issues like these way to frequently. Something really does need to be done.",

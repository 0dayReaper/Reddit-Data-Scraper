    "postText": "I had troubles with the registration page on Sunday evening. By the time I got in all but one  of my Junior Core classes were taken. I am pretty high up on the waitlist an don't believe I will get in. I met with the academic advisor who wasn't helpful. It looks like I will have to take Fin410, Fin453, and Fin 401 all next semester plus other classes. I am little worried that it will be too much and come back to hurt me. Is there anything I can do? Is only getting one class normal?",

I think it\u2019s manageable to take three at a time. If you get off the waitlist, great! If not, I wouldn\u2019t worry about taking all three at once. The nice thing about the finance core is that the classes are curved. The only class I might be worried about is Fin 410 as that can be quite intensive.",

If you had to rank those courses in terms of most difficult to least difficult, how would you do it? I know there is some subjectivity to it. But, I feel like there is a pretty good consensus that Fin410 is difficult for everyone.",

However, the way the class is set up, it is quite difficult. There are a ton of calculations done in excel on tests and tests were rather difficult on top of lots of hw. The tests also had a time limit (at least when I took it from Aiello) But hw was done in groups, so not terrible. \n\nFin 401- more of a manageable course. This course could still be a bit challenging, but once you get used to doing the cases and group work it\u2019s not too bad. I took it from Pratt.\n\nFin 453- least difficult and I felt like it was the most interesting. Entertaining lectures and tests weren\u2019t too difficult (multiple choice). I took from Argyle and he was awesome. Colby Wright also teaches the class and he\u2019s fantastic as well (had him for 409).",

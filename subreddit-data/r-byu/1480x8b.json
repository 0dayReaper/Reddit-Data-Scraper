Going back and forth between buildings might get a little old on Mondays and Wednesdays, but I suppose it\u2019ll let me stretch my legs. Other than that, I think I\u2019m pretty happy with my schedule, what are your thoughts?",

I then ended up taking classes just to fill the credit hours that weren't as easy as generals would have been.\nGranted, I got out of some generals due to AP, and I'm taking five years to graduate instead of four; however, you should definitely double-check that your major isn't a) credit hour-heavy, or b) the type where you can only take 2-3 major classes at a time (like CS) before you knock out all your generals. At least in my major, the classes are so time-consuming that it's physically impossible to take more than two at a time. I needed generals to fill the space in my schedule.",

You need light GE courses to mix in to keep full-time status. Those programs typically deliberately plan out prerequisites to force you to stagger major classes across 4 years. Getting off that track just extends your time at BYU.\n\nOutside of that, though, a full load of easy GEs your first semester to acclimate and maintain your scholarship sounds brilliant.",

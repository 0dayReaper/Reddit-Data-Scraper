    "postText": "We ran our first course on the lake last week and it was a great success! I hope we can keep filling out this course as the weather keeps getting nicer.\n\nOverview:\nThis is a 2 hour boating course where you'll actually go out on the water on a boat with an experienced captain to learn the basics of boating and it is absolutely free.\n\nNo experience needed, 6 spots available for each course and it runs on Fridays!\n\nSign-up link:\n\nhttps://calendly.com/saltlakecityacademy/boatsetter-academy-salt-lake-city?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=03242023     \n\nThis is one of 16 cities this course is being run in. The course is funded by the company Boatsetter which I work for, but I promise there will be no time-share speech. We're running this as a separate entity to become the \"Khan Academy of Boating\" aka free boating courses for everyone, forever.\n\nFor verification I\u2019ve created a self-post with photo albums/press releases/and reviews:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/chaunceybiggums/comments/137uj5v/photos_and_links_from_free_boating_courses/",

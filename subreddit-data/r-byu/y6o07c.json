Might as well throw in CHEM105 to complete the torture tbh /s",

How many hours/week?\n\nRegardless of your answer to the above question, I would move Physics to a different semester.\n\nIf you\u2019re working on top of all this, I would reschedule when you take American heritage, as well as Physics. Personally, I didn\u2019t mind American Heritage. It felt very much like high school to me, but perhaps that\u2019s because I took AP US History in high school. If it were me trying to balance this schedule I would go with the following:\n\n- CS 235\n- Math 113\n- Mission Prep\n- American Heritage (if not working)\n- Possibly a simple CS elective like 260 (Web Programming) or a different general, if you\u2019re short on credits to count as a full time student.\n\nI would strongly recommend getting Math 113 done next semester while the things learned in 112 are fresh in your mind. It\u2019ll only get harder the longer you wait between the two classes.",

When I took American Heritage, I pretty much did the reading, and whatever assignments we had, and skipped most classes and still got an A. I don't remember it being hard at all, and think if you have a decent understanding of US history and government, it's not actually hard. It's just taken by a lot of freshmen who don't know how to manage a college workload, so it seems hard.\n\nOn the other hand, physics 121 is actually hard, and the homework takes a lot of time to work through. As others have said, expect to spend lots of time in the TA lab.",

            "comment": "If you\u2019re a CS major then hopefully you\u2019ve got the coding scraps to do CS 235 without it being too time consuming. \n\nCalc 2 is horrendously time consuming. Don\u2019t do the homework anywhere but the help lab, and don\u2019t feel bad about using Quizlet\u2019s Slader when you\u2019re stuck and the TAs are busy (30 minute wait times are not unusual in the afternoon). Obviously don\u2019t just copy your homework out of it; the tests will wreck you; but it\u2019s a massive time saving tool.\n\nPhysics 121 is not bad. As a former TA for that class, I\u2019ve found that most of people\u2019s issues with that class are self-inflicted. If you just put down your calculator and solve problems entirely symbolically before you start screwing around with any of those annoying, time consuming, error prone numbers, then you\u2019ll be just fine. And you can get help in the help lab waaay faster than you can for Calc 2.\n\nPersonally I never took American Heritage; I was already pretty versed in American history and the philosophy and poli-sci option seemed more interesting. From what I can tell it\u2019s not a difficult class, there\u2019s just a lot of reading so either read strategically or be strategic in when you read. Going number 2? Read. Sitting on the bus? Read. Eating Lunch? Read. You get the idea, and it\u2019s a healthier option than your phone in any case.\n\nReligion classes vary by teacher. Some of them make it waaaaay too hard for a 2 credit class, others are great. Just check ratemyprofessor when picking your section.",

I would definitely take it this semester so you can move on to 236 next semester.\n\nCalc 2 is not a fun class, but just strap in for the ride.\n\nSome people don't have a hard time with physics. I did, but I also took it my first semester along with Calc 1. \n\nAmerican heritage is not too time consuming, but the tests are the least favorite I've taken at BYU. Just be ready for some not-so-fun tests. \n\nI'd say go for it! You'll quickly realize there are no easy semesters in the CS program. It's best to just strap in and work hard every semester.",

            "comment": "CS MAJOR!\n\nI asked a similar question as well. From what I am getting:\n\nCS 235 - very time consuming and difficult. I would go to Rate My Professor (it\u2019s an app) and try to get the best teacher on there. I had a roommate who was AMAZING at CS, but she got a B in this class because the teacher really sucked. Had to go to the TAs all the time. That didn\u2019t help much either. I suggest taking CS 111 because AP classes don\u2019t teach you everything. If you already took it, you\u2019ll be fine-ish. Don\u2019t expect an A though unless you don\u2019t want a social life.\n\nMATH 113 - time consuming, a bit more difficult than Calculus 1. But if your mathematically inclined you should be fine.\n\nPhysics 121 - did you take AP Physics in high school? If so, you should be fine. Get ready to learn and work hard! But it should be mostly review.\n\nAmerican Heritage - if your a STEM major, take David Sims. Madsen creates tests like the LSAT (law test). People rarely get an A. Great guy, great lecture. But if it\u2019s not your major, then take David Sims. Lots of reading, homework, essays, and tests!\n\nI would drop American Heritage - and that\u2019s because I find American history boring.",

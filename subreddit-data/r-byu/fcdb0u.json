BYU's approved housing system sets these people up to have freedom to do these terrible things with little consequence. Take a look at the google ratings on literally any BYU approved housing. They're all trash with landlords like this, but they keep having business because BYU \"approved\" them. What a joke.",

Pictures etc.  Always ask before checkout, \"do you have a list of the items you want taken care of...I'm determined to get my deposit back\" - You'd be surprised how willing they are to inform you and get you out with your deposit.

He said it took months and was a huge time sink, but in the end he did get a ton of his rent back due to the apartment being uninhabitable. \n\nStill though, the amount of hoops he had to jump through is why the system doesn't work super well. Most students don't want to take the time to go through the process, especially while they're going to school. Additionally, the landlord was making his life a living hell while he was going through the process, since he was still living in the apartment and couldn't get out of the contract.\n\nIn my friend's case it went well, but for others it may not be successful. In those cases, they wasted a ton of time and now have a landlord who hates them for the rest of the contract. The risk isn't worth it for a lot of people.",

When collecting-deposit time came they constantly came up with excuses to not give it to me. First it was that they didn't have my mailing address. That was a load of hot garbage, I gave them my parent's. Then their \"printer wasn't working\". Okay, I'll give you a pass on technical difficulties but expected it would be fixed within a day. Then nothing happened for 3 weeks. So I call and they tell me to go to the  company that manages the Riviera and pick it up from them. Even being there in person after writing countless emails about it,they still made a fuss. Its in the contract just give me back my dang money that you agreed you would return!\n\nIt's just plain old greed.",

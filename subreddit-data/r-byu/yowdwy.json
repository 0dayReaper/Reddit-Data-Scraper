This is a 10 question survey that takes only a few minutes and would be greatly appreciated. I dont know if surveys are allowed on this thread so sorry if it is not.\n\n[https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_8dIsTYQDAuHXJoq](https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8dIsTYQDAuHXJoq)",

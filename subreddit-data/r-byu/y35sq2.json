    "postText": "Howdy, Cougs. Apologies if someone has already posted asking questions. I\u2019m Brigham-Young bound and would like to know:\n\n1) Any cool spots or things in Provo/on campus to do or see that aren\u2019t advertised on a brochure?\n\n2) Best spots to eat, either in Provo or even Salt Lake\n\n3) Is parking for the game a big obstacle like it is in some places? Or should $20-$30 do me fine?\n\n\nThanks in advance for any you of willing to help! I\u2019m really looking forward to my time in the area as well as the game!",

            "comment": "Welcome to Provo!\n\n1. I would suggest taking a drive through Provo canyon and \u2018The Alpine Loop.\u2019  That drive is absolutely spectacular this time of year. You will think you were in the alps\u2026 no joke! While you\u2019re on that road, take a stop off at Sundance. It\u2019s a really pretty ski resort that has some great walking paths and a nice cafe. \n\n2. Black Sheep cafe, Communal, Guru\u2019s, Indian Palace, all in the Center Street/University avenue area \n\n3. It will be for this game. You can find free parking all over the city. I would suggest parking somewhere downtown near center street and then walk to the stadium. It would be a half hour walk, but it might be a nice stroll through the city :) if you really want to park closer, I would recommend parking East of the stadium up towards the Student health center. There are usually spots there \n\nHope this helps!",

The River Trail can be accessed at a bunch of different spots, and it\u2019s beautiful all over.\n\nProvo has much better ethnic restaurants than you would expect: a lot of good Indian and Vietnamese places. There\u2019s a restaurant called \u201cChinatown\u201d south of campus that has okay American Chinese food and an incredible secret menu of more authentic Chinese food. \n\nAlso, I cannot recommend Four Seasons Hot Pot &amp; Dumplings enough. The food is great, and the Wangs are the nicest people. If you want dumplings, you have to order in advance, but the hot pot is always awesome.",

Graham Canyon is usually people\u2019s favorite. Cookies and Cream milk is also unique to BYU and very good. \n\nSlab Pizza slaps, always.\n\nParking by center street and taking the UVX bus is a great idea for sure. I usually will park in one of the BYU campus lots though (they are free and unrestricted on Saturdays) and walk from there. If you want to avoid traffic after the game and don\u2019t mind a walk, park in the lots south of campus (the stadium is North of campus). It\u2019s closer than center street but just as available as long as you are showing up with some time before the game. \n\nAlpine loop is cool but traffic is tough through there. Walking up Rock Canyon is an easy hike but super pretty! Hiking the Y gives a great view but is way harder!",

The Utah valley itself doesn't have as many good \"lookout spots\"/views with a bunch of forests or wildlife. Down here it's pretty much all city. For a nice place to visit, you'll want to head on the East side of the mountains. I would agree with the other posts saying that the Alpine loop would be great. It takes you out of the city to see the pretty side of the mountains. Definitely drive the loop, it should take about an hour or so depending on how fast you go. You're luckily coming to Utah during the few weeks the fall colors are nice. \n\nAs for food, Pogo's Great Pizza and Chicken, Bombay House, Chom Burger, Kokonut Island Grill, and Two Jack's Pizza are all great places to try in the Provo area. If you go a little ways out, Chubby's in Orem or Vineyard is good as well as 7 Brothers up in Northern Provo. If you want BBQ, Bam Bams is your best bet in Provo.",

Nowhere in town comes close to beating it for breakfast and there's enough variety to make two visits well worth it.  \n\n**Fast Casual:** Cubby\u2019s, Cafe Rio or Costa Vida\n\n**Basically born on BYU\u2019s campus:** Slab pizza, Cupbop (of Shark Tank fame), J-dawgs, BYU creamery\n\nCan\u2019t imagine you\u2019d have time for anything else beyond that. I would personally grab Slab or a J-Dawg and then walk to the byu creamery for ice cream. Creamery burgers are not consistent - sometimes they\u2019re amazing and other times they\u2019re legitimately disgusting, just depends on the 18 year old making it. Creamery ice cream always slaps though. Graham canyon or marionberry ice cream or a Lavell\u2019s Vanilla malt is what I\u2019d go with.\n\nLook at the UVX route and try to find a parking lot away from campus along UVX. Take UVX to the stop by the southeast corner of campus. Get off and go to j-dawgs, Slab, or cupbop then walk to the creamery. Find a uvx stop again and ride to the stadium (or walk, it\u2019s not that bad honestly).\n\nGet chocolate milk and a cougar tail in the stadium. It\u2019s just a maple bar and milk but it\u2019s good and definitely a BYU experience\n\nI\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t, but please do not go to any bbq restaurants in Provo. They are not good and as a southerner I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be particularly disappointed.\n\nGlad to see another southerner making the trip out - see you at the game!!\n\nEdit: Coming back because Hruska's just popped into my head. Added it to the list. Please go for breakfast and grab a sausage and gravy kolache, or literally any of them. It's so good.",

I can't get my brain to focus and I am performing poorly in alot of aspects of my life ATM. I just can't seem to get out of this funk longer then a few days.\n\nAny tips for fighting through burnout/overcoming it/finding joy?",

Helps distract me from a full time job and &gt;20 grad school credits which is a soul sucking workload at times.",

Second the thing that has helped me out a lot is talking about it. I met with my boss and told him about feeling burnt out and luckily he was very understanding. I also opened up to a friend about some of the specific things getting me down and it felt really good to be validated and externalize how I\u2019ve been feeling. \n\nNext semester I definitely plan to scale back my work load as much as I can. And don\u2019t rule out seeking therapy for any other mental things that might be going on. Even if burnout is the only thing you are dealing with, having an more objective outside perspective is incredibly valuable. \n\nKnow you aren\u2019t alone and reach out. BYU professors tend to be very understanding. We all need to rely on our support structures every once in awhile, and if you need to chat, DM me and I\u2019ll definitely elaborate on anything I said here. I can also just listen if you need. You\u2019ve got this. You made it this far after all.",

You'll find the motivation once there.\n\nFor doing HW and studying, bonus if you get a study group or partner because it becomes easier to focus. On your own? go somewhere on campus and study in a way that you can't goof off. \n\nRecognize too that the winter months hit hard with S.A.D. Make yourself time to be outside every day, and make exercise a priority. If you need motivation, sign up for the evening weight lifting class or one right as your day ends so that you're forced to get exercise for a grade.\n\nYou've got this",

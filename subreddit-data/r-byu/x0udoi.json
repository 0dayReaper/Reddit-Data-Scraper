What are some good study spaces that are relatively private even in the fall semester?\n\nEdit: I forgot a pretty important detail, sorry! I\u2019m majoring in a foreign language and really need somewhere I can practice out loud without disturbing others.",

Deep in the library in the corners, or high floors on the JFSB are pretty good. One of the bathrooms high in the SWKT even has a shower so you can have extended stays up there if you need to.\n\nIf you don't need a table, there are benches in the MOA in some quieter areas.",

I don't have the link for booking rooms on hand but you could probably google it. \n\nIf you don't feel like constantly trying to book a room and your major has you staying in or around only one or two buildings for most of your time at BYU then I'd start there and look for unoccupied classrooms or spaces during your free time. \n\nOtherwise, I'd suggest exploring the bottom floor of the library. Not many students go down there and I always found open spaces by myself. The downsides are that it takes more time to get to and the wifi wasn't always the best, but it's been a few years since I would go down there so it could be better now.",

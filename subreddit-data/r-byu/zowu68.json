It was a stake academy before the church sold it to the state during the Great Depression. Even today, about half of the students are members and the institute building is huge.",

Of course, it's a little arbitrary, as there are potent applications of many \"pure\" fields - modern cryptosystems are built on number theory that's a couple hundred years old - and the \"applied\" fields all have deep theory behind them - any serious study of partial differential equations requires a significant amount of functional analysis.",

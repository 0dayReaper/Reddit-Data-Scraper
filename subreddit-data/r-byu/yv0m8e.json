They only allow ~15-20 students in a year (but it's rolling enrollment)\n\nThere is a different application and they try to keep this major on the DL, hence why you can't find it as easily online. \n\nThe major is really an independent course you do in the marriott school, so you don't have like the group junior core like other majors do.",

It\u2019s mostly for people who are going to dental or medical school and are going to need some business skills. It\u2019s much better to major in something else and then get an MBA",

I know that\u2019s what they will tell you but they really just want to know why you want that major and how it can help you in your career journey.\n\nIf you present them with a clear plan about your Intentions of taking that path, they will let you apply (and from my experience, get in without a problem) \n\nBe aware, they will try everything in their power to push you towards any of the other major paths. This is why you need to have a clear plan to discuss and be serious about this move.",

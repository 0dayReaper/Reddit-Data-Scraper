An example being Bob Jones University and how the supreme court ruled against their sincerely held religious belief.",

That DOES NOT MEAN that BYU has horrible professors, academics, labs, etc. Those are all fantastic elements-- among the best in the country in many respects. \n\nBut like Holland mentioned in his controversial talk not too long ago, \n\n&gt;\u201cIf at a future time that mission means foregoing some professional affiliations and certifications, then so be it. There may come a day when the price we are asked to pay for such association is simply too high, too inconsistent with who we are. No one wants it to come to that, least of all me, but if it does, we will pursue our own destiny.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Compare BYU's mission statement to several other university statements. I've included just two here: another [Christian university](https://www.pepperdine.edu/about/our-story/mission-vision/) (their [strategic plan](https://www.pepperdine.edu/about/strategic-plan/vision-statement.htm) emphasizes the difference too) and a ['secular' university](https://academic-affairs.utah.edu/missionstatement/). BYU's reads more like a church manual or proclamation rather than a mission statement. \n\n  \nThe result is students look at BYU's academic reputation + their own personal values at the time + tuition and think its a great choice. Most want to get a degree so they can get a 'good job' (hopefully there's more to why one studies than that). But when the foundation is so fundamentally different than other universities, some students will get disillusioned with  [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/nnwloc/we_need_to_rally_students_against_och_housing/) [aspects](https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/jqodey/does_the_honor_code_office_stand_in_need_of/) of BYU, not just this rule. \n\n  \nIn this loss of faith case, would letting disaffiliated student continue at BYU coincide with it's mission? **No. BYU can't assist the student in their quest for eternal life if they decided to disaffiliate. Bottom line is BYU isn't fulfilling their mission in this case, so anything else isn't relevant.** Just for the record, I don't agree with the policy, but I do enjoy being at BYU and don't regret my choice to be here. \n\n  \nI hope we never face a situation where BYU has to choose between certification and one of it's values, but if that ever happens, BYU would certainly not have 34000 students.",

However, it also believes in agency and the right of the individual to choose.  We are taught that the most central aspect of Satan's plan is the elimination of individual agency.  If the church undertakes a position which limits the agency of the individual in the realm of religious belief (presumably that aspect of agency which is most precious), then it seems like its following Satan's plan.  BYUs primary purpose should be to assist in fulfilling Gods plan for humankind, and as such should place a high value on preserving the agency of all individuals.  We can and should place limits on actions which are harmful to oneself or others.  This could include consumption of alcohol, physical harm to others, or spending too much time on Reddit :).  But when we undertake to prescribe thought crimes, we are in an ethically precarious position, whether we are the LDS church, China, North Korea, or anyone else.",

They choose what they allow to influence them, the guides they look to to navigate that, and ultimately belief and faith are choices each of us makes.

Saying what comes first don't make it so.\n\n&gt;One of the earliest schools to try to follow in Notre Dame\u2019s footsteps was Brigham Young University. When the Church of latter-Day Saints abandoned polygamy in 1890, it wrestled with finding a new identifier of Mormon manhood. BYU\u2019s football program provided Mormons the answer they were looking for. To introduce BYU coaches to the game, they hired famed Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne to host a coaching clinic in Provo. As the premier Mormon university entered the uncharted waters of major college football, BYU hoped to follow Rockne\u2019s success at Notre Dame. \n\nhttps://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2021/08/why-baylor-will-never-be-notre-dame-ecclesiastical-polity-and-college-football/\n\nP.S.

As an exmo I'll never be able to attend graduate school at BYU, yet I would have been able to attend if I had never been a member. I don't mind paying a higher tuition to offset the tithing issue. I have a massive issue with the school continually seeking my donations despite preventing me from attending further schooling. I happen to have a lot of friends that are still members of the church and we're very respectful towards each other.\n\nI was fortunate to graduate despite going through a faith crisis while attending BYU. This policy fosters a culture of fear between students and bishops and further advances the mental health crisis we're experiencing.",

I passed up other opportunities with greater pay, prestige, and access to research facilities and funding because as a devout member of the church I wanted to be a part of BYU.  After 18 years on the faculty, as a tenured professor in good standing in the university and in the church, getting some of the highest teaching evaluations in my college, having published papers and received external grant funding, and having just won the top annual teaching award in my college, I felt I could no longer pretend I believed in something that I had stopped believing years ago.  Although BYU does have non member faculty, it does not allow former members to work there under the same conditions as someone who had never been a member - even if you tow the line and support the LDS church in every way possible short of claiming to personally believe in it's teachings, and never ever mention your beliefs to anyone on or off campus.  Even if you attend church and fulfill a calling, the mere fact that some administrator knows that you don't really believe with automatically get you fired.",

But I was given an expired tenure track which allowed me to apply for tenure after one year there using that year plus my accomplishments over my last 5 years at BYU as evidence.  So I now have tenure again.  Also, the process is much more transparent here than it was at BYU.  And, as an added bonus, since I'm at a state school, legally no one can ever again condescendingly tell me to \"pray about it\" to know I am wrong when I disagree with them about research directions for the department. \ud83d\ude01",

I have my transcripts in my possession. Why wouldn't a BYU kid have their own transcripts in their possession?\n\nA transcript is a transcript. Even the kid who dropped out before graduation isn't complaining about not having a transcript. \n\nThe problem is the Major and requirements for degrees at other Universities. Another University might make the kid who got kicked out before graduation take a couple other classes that BYU did not make them take. And classes BYU made the kid take... Another University might look at them and say they won't count towards anything at the new institution. \n\nThere are a myriad of factors other Colleges might not take BYU credits straight-across and vice-versa. \n\nHopefully the kid who got kicked out finds an accommodating College, or BYU can accommodate them somehow to finish their degree. \n\nOne of my best friends in College was a young woman who got kicked-out of BYU. I had been on a HS leadership trip to BYU when I got kicked-out for wearing shorts. I had no idea. Then, as a funny series of events, I was recruited (athletics) to BYU, and I turned them down. So... My friend who got kicked out of BYU turned out to be a wonderful young woman who helped me get ready for my mission. She was a good friend, a good person, and I was glad she was part of my life. She and I became fast friends. We went to Church together. She taught me about forgiveness and repentance and was a wonderful example of the good non-judgmental people at Church. \n\nHopefully the kid lands on his feet. \n\nBut there are a myriad of reasons BYU credits might not transfer for a transferring kid.",

They pay their tithing, attend church every week, hold a calling, maintain honor code compliance, and maintain their ecclesiastical endorsement.  They graduate without any problems, but a year after graduation leave the church.  \n\nStudent B is the same as student A in every way.  For the entirety of their BYU they pay tithing, attend church every week, hold a calling, maintain honor code compliance, however their personal religious beliefs change their senior year to something that is not compatible with belief in modern prophets.  They are committed to continuing all of the same actions they have previously done, with the single exception of publicly expressing belief in the LDS church.  \n\nMy question is, in what way have they broken the agreement they made when they became a student?  What is the difference between Student A and Student B other than timing?  Monetarily they are still contributing tithing at the same rate, their volunteer involvement supporting the local church is still the same, they maintain the same behavioral standards they agreed to in the honor code?  \n\nSo I think your argument fails on two points: \n\n1) You are essentially arguing that the lynchpin to the agreement the Church makes isn't money, but that a student at BYU must benefit the Church longterm (either by being a fully believing and participating member, or a potential convert).  The value to the church then is the primary factor on whether or not they extend their subsidized tuition.  This however isn't the agreement that the school is offering.  There is no term in the \"contract\" that requires a student participate in the Church after graduation.  So you're implying a condition of the contract exists that isn't actually part of the deal.  \n\n2) You are using the monetary aspect of the transaction as evidence of an ethical breach.  However, there is nothing that a non-believing student couldn't do except for profess belief while they remain at BYU that would fundamentally change their involvement or obligations to the school.  The money isn't the issue, if it were, simply continuing to pay tithing would meet their obligations to monetarily contribute to the Church.",

I'm just postulating here as to what some of those reasons might be. \n\nThat being said, assuming my other argument above is invalid for now, the only other thing I'd argue here, which is an entirely separate point, is that someone staying at BYU despite having left the church is taking a coveted spot away from some other hopeful applicant.

It is unethical to unilaterally deprive someone of their continued education, and make portions of their received education worthless (required religion credits) when the original agreement hasn't been broken.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, here is the language required to receive an ecclesiastical endorsement.

By accepting appointment, continuing in employment, being admitted, or continuing class enrollment, each member of this community personally commits to observe these Honor Code standards approved by the Board of Trustees \u201cat all times and in all things, and in all places\u201d (Mosiah 18:9):  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Be honest.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Live a chaste and virtuous life, including abstaining from any sexual relations outside a marriage between a man and a woman.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Respect others, including the avoidance of profane and vulgar language.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Obey the law and all campus policies.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Abstain from alcoholic beverages, tobacco, tea, coffee, vaping, and substance abuse.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Participate regularly in Church services (required only of Church members).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Observe the dress and grooming standards.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Encourage others in their commitment to comply with the Honor Code.",

Sure, fair enough. Maybe they'll get a handful of students honest enough to not lie to avoid student loans. Good luck with that one",

That\u2019s pretty common knowledge \u2013 BYU is a great deal for members and nonmembers alike.\n\nYou originally asked whether it was ethical to stay enrolled at BYU and pay nonmember tuition as a former member, and to that my answer is a resounding yes, because BYU advertises nonmember pricing. \n\nWhether it accomplishes what BYU wants is an entirely different question that has no ethical implications (see my Macey\u2019s ice cream cone example). I agree that BYU probably advertises nonmember pricing primarily for the objective of enticing nonmembers to BYU and converting them. What they don\u2019t advertise is that if you come in Mormon and then change religions, you\u2019ll be kicked out, which IMO is highly unethical",

Anyways, the icecream cone example doesn't work at all in my opinion. Because if they were offering free icecream cones for anyone who is LDS, or anyone who *could potentially establish an interest in becoming LDS*, then it's not ethical for someone who *was* LDS and *decided to leave* to show up looking for a free ice cream cone. Because let's be honest, we all know why they're willing to hand out ice cream cones for free. \n\nBottom line is this - the church is willing to subsidize tuition for non-members because it's a good way to bring people into the church. They aren't willing to subsidize tuition for someone who *left* the church because that person is not a potential member or a potential tithe payer. It's really not that complicated. \n\nYou can argue that the church should offer fully unsubsidized tuition rates for ex-members to stay in school. That's fair, although it's not what you're arguing. But I'd argue that anyone who is willing to lie about their ecclesiastical status to stay at BYU is likely willing to lie to keep a dramatically lower tuition rate and avoid student loans.",

To me that tells me that the church is willing to subsidize some tuition on the chance that those who receive it will convert and spend a lifetime paying tithing thereafter - giving a net positive ROI for the church. For students who leave they are much less likely to return and therefore only lose the church money. \n\nBut this is assuming that the church runs BYU as an investment - getting more out of almost every student (probably by an enormous margin) than they pay over the lifetime of the ~~investment~~ student/alumni. \n\nThis is also why I don\u2019t feel guilty about staying by at BYU longer than 4 years and taking up more of that precious subsidized tuition. Over my life the church probably already has or absolutely will get make more than they paid for me.",

But \nI'd argue that anyone willing to lie about their ecclesiastical status to avoid getting kicked out of BYU is also willing to lie to avoid much higher tuition rates.

It's a great missionary tool.\n\nAh, yes. Monetary benefits, a great tool to use in getting people to convert to a religion.\n\nAgreed with you that offering completely unsubsidized tuition to those who leave the LDS religion would be the fair approach. I think you've got a point that a big price hike like that could incentivize people to lie. But if they're lying, they're likely to continue paying tithing to keep up the appearance and not raise suspicion. Cheaper that way than paying likely more than double what member tuition is.\n\nSo as long as they continue to pay tithing, from your perspective, why does it matter if they're lying about their belief? They're still paying in to the tithing that subsidizes their education. The only benefit they gain is not being expelled, and the status quo is not changed at all.",

At no point did I ever consider there to be any sort of an \"understanding\" (written or spoken) that I would \"pay back\" into the system that subsidized my education. Morality is individual, and so I suppose my leaving before I paid back whatever I got wasn't in the least bit immoral.\n\nIn fact, in hindsight, I've been an unmitigated financial disaster for the Mormon church. I served my mission in one of the most expensive European areas and was fully subsidized by members of my home ward. I had a serious medical issue that required diagnosis and treatment in the region's most expensive hospital, and that went on the mission's (i.e., the church's) books. In the two years I was in the field, I had exactly zero baptisms, and in fact I always left my areas with fewer investigators than there were when I transferred in. In one case the branch's only active members turned inactive while I was stationed there. Then the Mormon church heavily subsidized my BYU education. I spent about 9 months in two different on-campus research labs where I didn't actually do anything of consequence (in hindsight) but still collected a paycheck nonetheless. I married someone who also served a mission and was from a deep Mormon heritage, and I pulled them out of the church along with me. Then several of their relatives mustered up the courage to leave themselves, saying that they were inspired to finally take the leap after seeing her leave.\n\nOf course I've never once responded to any telemarketers from the school who call alumni for donations in the years since I graduated.\n\nIf running a negative $$ balance with the Mormon church is really immoral, then I guess I have all the more I'm going to have to suffer for in the afterlife!",

I still believe in Jesus Christ and I believe he\u2019s my savior. However, I don\u2019t believe this is the only true church on the earth and I believe that people can be \u201csaved\u201d in other religions. It\u2019s really tough because according to this policy I would be unworthy to attend byu over a crisis that is very personal to me. I comply with every other aspect of the honor code and I still pay tithing. But attending church now just makes me sad and apathetic.",

Pretty simple.\n\nSo many people in here are conflating \"having a personal faith crisis\" with \"removing your name from the church\" (or merely not attending). According to OP's surreptitious recording, the latter results in expulsion. That appears to be the policy. I don't think the former results in expulsion even though you imply it does (but I'm curious if anybody has evidence that it is also part of the policy).",

I never went to BYU but if you would have told me 5 years ago I'd stop believing in the church, I'd have laughed in your face and told you I'd die first.

It's not like one person leaves the church and another hopeful applicant gets a \"good news - we now have room for you!\" email. Colleges do track re-enrollment rates and all that in determining how many new people to accept in the incoming class, but if the number of students leaving Mormonism is enough to actually affect the admission rate when the majority of them went specifically for Mormon culture in the first place, the church has a way bigger problem than subsidized tuition.\n\nI get your argument, I do. It's their school. If they want to use tuition as a means to attract and retain new and existing members, that's their right. I'm just saying as people that stand for god and preach freedom of religion and free agency, to use that same exact concept to push people into either staying with that one religion or lying to everyone around them until they get out or be faced with losing all the work they've done (a fair amount of credits don't transfer to other schools as I understand it) is a really fucked up thing to do. Having the right doesn't make it right. I think we agree that there's nothing that says they can't do that. It's just a really fucked up thing to do, morally.",

I'm simply speaking in terms of what I feel BYU should or shouldn't do, as an amalgam of all relevant value systems at play, of which I'm sure we've barely scratched the surface. \n\nFor example, most people here are arguing that BYU is *ethically* obligated to change their policy. Nobody is really arguing that they are legally required to, and rightly so. Those are separate value systems. Which begs the question, what other value systems are at play in this complex decision? \n\nFor example, how do we reconcile \"do unto others\" with the capitalist value system of \"I me mine\"? Well most decent people with a desire to make money simply override \"do unto others\" with a line drawn in the sand of \"don't do harm to others\". These are two different value systems at play. The perfect capitalist would never care about anyone else (see big corporations) and the perfect Christian would never make any money (see Christ). Most capitalist Christians find a good medium somewhere in between where the value systems can coexist somewhat. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying that capitalism vs Christian values are the only value systems at play here either. There are other value structures that we haven't even considered (and that I'm not qualified to consider) that are likely at play, so reducing it all down to ethics just seems ignorant, when you look at closer.",

If you\u2019re at a school that will kick you out if you start believing a different way you have to completely close yourself off to any new or different ideas, opinions, or experiences for the whole time to remain safe. When teachers point out facts about early church history or explain scientific principals that precious church leaders have spoken against the student has to fight back against them to maintain standing at the school. I had a few different majors at BYU and even seemingly unrelated fields taught things that went counter to the church\u2019s narrative (e.g. evolution, Tower of Babel as origins of language, the effects of the second great awakening on american religions and the origin of certain doctrines). So Elder Holland tells the teachers to stop teaching those things. We should become an enclave to protect these students minds from thinking. If that means we lose certain accreditations so be it.",

Why can\u2019t their tuition just be adjusted, and allow them to continue as a Catholic?\n\nMaking statements like this and calling it out for the logical conundrum it is is how ridiculous policies like this change.

One is free to leave, but there are consequences following breaching the contract.",

They\u2019re tangential, at best.\n\nIf you were accepted into BYU as a member of the COJCLDS, you did so (at least partially) based on your service to the faith up to that point. Admission decisions are made based on that application, and the likelihood of the prospective students to achieve success and bring further credit to the university.\n\nThus, it does not bother me that renouncing your membership leads to expulsion. You could, in my mind, reasonably reapply as a member of a new faith, but there would be no guarantee of admission, and the admissions office may look differently on your application as you may or may not be likely to bring credit to the university as a former member.\n\nAlso, I was unaware of this rule prior to this post. But it makes sense to me. A suggestion may be for the admissions packet and ecclesiastical endorsement forms to make mention that renouncing one\u2019s membership will lead to immediate expulsion from the university\u2026if such a statement is not already included. Nonetheless, regardless of the university you select, you will always have to play by their rules if you want to play in their sandbox.\n\nBest wishes to you on finishing up your collegiate career \u2014 an accomplishment of which to be very proud!",

And if you were born a member, baptized at 8, then never attended until you graduated and removed your name from the church as an adult you could not apply at all.",

            "comment": "So you feel cool because you danced around a bunch of low ranking honor code admins.  Congratulations on your debating skills.  BYU is a private university that confers academic degrees.  You feel that somehow academic culture as espoused in the US academic system somehow trumps the BYU mission.  BYU existed before modern day academic tradition.  BYU follows it own traditions.  It really doesn\u2019t care about anyone else\u2019s and it really shouldn\u2019t. \n\nThe sad thing is that you still feel that US modern academic tradition is somehow an ideal with values that should be higher than BYUs values and mission statement.  If you were at another school they wouldn\u2019t do this to you, is your sentiment.  The reality is that the US academic system is probably the most corrupt, least efficient, and most unethical institution in the US today.  It is the only thing worse than the US health care system and the VA health care system.  There is nothing about our modern academic system that is enviable.  It is so corrupt it needs to die.  From research, tenure, to administration their is nothing about the system that functions to serve the public good.  The mission statements for almost every University should be something along the lines of \n\nTo serve ourselves, the admin, by taking money from the public to build temples to our vanity so we can advance our careers.  To publish useless research so we can get tenure so we can work 15 hour weeks and get paid 6 figure salaries.  To take money from kids that don\u2019t understand the debt they are undertaking so we can indirectly as much money from the federal government as humanly possible.  \n\nIt\u2019s a contract you sign when you go to BYU, between you and the school.  No other contracts matter.  You can bring up non-members all day long but you signed the contract between you and the school.  \n\nBut it is not fair\u2026 Well son I hate to be the one to sit you down and tell you that your fast talking will only get you so far.  Life isn\u2019t fair.  The world doesn\u2019t revolve around what you think is fair.  You signed a contract and like everyone else that fails to live up to the contract you don\u2019t get to play both sides.    Posting a video about an apostle and agency is a vain attempt to justify you breaking your contract.  You could be the most right person in the world.  The church could be a cult and BYU could be a sham but you broke your contract.  Surely here on Reddit 1000 people will pay you on the back and said you did a brave thing.  Well I am telling you that nobody cares.  In ten minutes everyone that said you were such a hero will forget your name and move on and what will you be left with Bitterness, debt, and no degree from BYU.  \n\nCongratulations on winning absolutely nothing and losing everything.  Good luck putting your life back together.  I truly hope that you can do that quickly and effectively.  I don\u2019t wish you any personal harm.",

It was a mess to navigate, horrible for music (the band and orchestra rooms were so bad acoustically that we had to wear earplugs during rehearsal, and the De Jong was called a concert hall but 100% not designed for music), and had a lot of other issues. Buildings like the Brimhall, Maeser Building, and even the testing center are beautiful examples of architecture.\n\nNext I want the MARB to come down.",

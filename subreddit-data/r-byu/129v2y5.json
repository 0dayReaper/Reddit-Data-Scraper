This led to an almost 98% acceptance rate last year. \n\nB\u2019s on your prerequisites is the minimum to apply and B+ on your prerequisites will definitely still get you in. I think my non-prerequisite GPA was around 3.7 and my prerequisite gpa was B+ in accounting 200 and 310 and an A in IS201 and I\u2019m doing more than well in the program. I\u2019ll be making 6 figures already after graduating. As long as accounting and its related careers is something you genuinely want to do and you put in the work, you\u2019ll be fine getting in to the program. Feel free to pm/chat me if you have any other questions",

Almost all of them have subsequently gone to post baccalaureate programs to either go into accounting or nursing. \n\nMy point being that if you want to get your CPA and that's the goal, keep your mind open to other schools should BYU not work out. If your goal is to graduate from BYU, then go for it and keep your options open should accounting not work out. \n\nWhatever your life goals are, you need to be open to having life throw a wrench in them.",

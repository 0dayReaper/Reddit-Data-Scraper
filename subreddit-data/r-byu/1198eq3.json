Consult with a financial advisor before dropping close to half a million on a condo that probably is worth a third of that.\n\n---\n\nIMO, you only get one freshman year. And the dorms were a real hoot. I'd highly recommend them.  Remember: A BYU \"dorm scene\" is very different than at other schools.  \n\nThat gives you another year to figure out what you want to buy, if at all, rather than rushing into something.",

A lot of my now lifelong close friends from college came from the freshman dorms, I was in Heritage as well so it felt more like apartment style living than dorms (with a kitchen and private bathrooms). We had cleaning checks once a month, and our RA was fairly forgiving in giving us lots of tries to get it right. It was also nice being so close to everything on campus, especially without a car.",

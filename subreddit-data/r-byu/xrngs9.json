There was a keg in one of the closets. The landlord seemed quite surprised and embarrassed when we stumbled on it.\n\nFast forward ten years or so, and I was doing maintenance part-time for a family member that owned several BYU-approved rental properties in Provo. Every so often I'd come across a room with a bunch of empty beer cans. (My family member would always be quite upset, since that meant their BYU-approval status was at risk.)",

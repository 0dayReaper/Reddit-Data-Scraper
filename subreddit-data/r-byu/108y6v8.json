I live in Orem and because of certain circumstances I have to drive home and back multiple times throughout the day. 9, 12, and 2, there isn\u2019t a single parking pace open. Went again at FIVE PM and there were like 4 spots open. Parking at the Marriott center lot is ridiculous because it\u2019s like a 20 minute walk to any of my classes. Are people parking without paying for passes? Are there WAY more people this semester or something? What is happening",

Yes it is less convenient but you benefit from both improved personal health and not having to worry about driving in Utah traffic which has been rated amongst the worst in the country. \n\nNow UTA and BYU Busses could use some improvement for sure but you need to make your voice heard. Let the administration know. Even about parking because otherwise they\u2019ll plan away your parking.",

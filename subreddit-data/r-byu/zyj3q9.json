I think changing them ended in the late November to early December area.\n\nI had dining plus this year during the winter 2022 semester. Money starts adding into your dining account (look in your financial account) if you skip a meal from the cannon commons. They\u2019ll refund you your money for what you did NOT eat. Then you can use that money to go wherever you want to eat on BYU campus.\n\nIf you never skip a meal from the cannon commons, you don\u2019t get a refund for that meal.\n\nThat\u2019s at least how it was for me in the fall 2021 and winter 2022 semester.\n\nEdit:\n\nIf your wondering when you can go back to school and eat on BYU campus with your dining plan, then I believe that would be Jan 6th when people start coming back or moving in for free.",

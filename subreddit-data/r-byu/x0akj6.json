I'm coming to provo for the byu/baylor game in a few weeks, and I wanted to see how strict they are with the bag policy at the stadium. the website says small clutch style bags are allowed, if my bag is an inch or so bigger, will I be able to get it in? also the website didn't say anything about it needing to be clear, just wanted to make sure that's right! most stadiums in texas require clear bags, so that's what I was expecting, lol. thank you!",

If you\u2019re bag is an inch or so bigger you should be okay, but it totally up to the discretion of which employee is at the entrance you are going into. Even if your bag is clear, it needs to be close to the 5x8x1 inches dimensions listed.",

It looks like you can can carry a normal purse as long as it\u2019s small enough, but anything larger will have to be a clear bag.\n\nhttps://universe.byu.edu/2018/09/11/new-clear-bag-policy-for-lavell-edwards-stadium-1/\n\nI\u2019ve worked at the stadium letting people in before, and I\u2019m pretty sure they won\u2019t bring out a ruler to measure your purse. As long as it looks like it\u2019s the right size, you should be fine. However, I don\u2019t have a lot of experience with this\u2014hopefully someone else will comment too.",

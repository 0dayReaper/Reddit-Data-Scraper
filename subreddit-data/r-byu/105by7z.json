If you read any sentence, I could tell you the book and chapter. I aced all the tests, but the teacher required us to write journal entries every day. I really didn't like to write journal entries, so I lost lots of credit on those. It definitely taught me to check the syllabus for a teacher a drop immediately if the teacher has a requirement like writing in a journal.",

On one hand, you have cultural norms (to say nothing of religion) that make openness about homosexuality taboo, while on the other hand you have cultural norms that make criticism of that same openness taboo. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just the nature of discussions on polemic topics that opposing viewpoints will naturally discourage against each other\u2019s promotion in public settings. That being said, I still feel like the case of LGBT issues on campus is a poignant example.",

They explained to the membership in official statements that this practice at the time was not just a matter of policy but that it was core to the doctrine of the LDS church.  \n\nNow obviously they were wrong, but the First Presidency of the church at the time couldn't even see 10 years into the future.  I think its silly that you imagine you know the timelessness of a church policy or practice when the first presidency never does. \n\nJohn Taylor as prophet promised the membership that polygamy was never go away and that if it did it mean the church had fallen into apostasy.  Obviously you don't believe that.   But what feels like core doctrine today is going to be simply the misguided leadership of the past.   \n\nWhen I look at core doctrine heterosexual marriage never enters the picture.   You have a very strange definition of core doctrine.    I think the gospel has plenty of room to allow for celestial gay marraige and nothing changes.  \n\nI mean we probably have to give women the priesthood as well to make it work doctrinally for lesbian weddings, but doctrinally that is not a problem as all as women techincally already get the preisthood in this lifetime if they get their second annointing.  Its only practiced during that anointing but temple doctrine is very clear that women get all the creative priesthood power that men get and this is confirmed in the second anointing where women will conclude the anointing by blessing their husbands with the laying on of hands.\n\nAnyway, its painfully obvious to me that the church will change its tune on gay marriage.  I would be willing to bet my life on it.  The only question is do we see that change in 10 years or in 20 years?   \n\nMaybe a specific question for you, would it change the gospel at all for you if this current church practice did change?",

Members of the First Presidency may have made such statements, and even done so in official fora like General Conference, but that does not constitute an official statement of the church, signed onto by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve as official doctrine, like the Family Proclamation is.\n\n&gt;John Taylor as prophet promised the membership that polygamy was never go away and that if it did it mean the church had fallen into apostasy. Obviously you don't believe that.\n\nActually I do. Polygamy has never gone away. It is not currently practiced in mortality as a matter of legal expediency, but it is still an eternal principle. Several general authorities currently practice polygamy with active sealings to multiple wives, just with only one currently living.\n\n&gt;When I look at core doctrine heterosexual marriage never enters the picture.\n\nYou clearly haven't read the Family Proclamation or D&amp;C 132 then. Heterosexual Celestial Marriage is a *definitional* requirement for exaltation. The whole point is propagation of Eternal Families; you can't really do that without both the male and female aspects.\n\nAs for a second anointing, I don't know what you are talking about. The laying on of hands is practiced by women in the Initiatory, so unless there's an anointing before that then that's the first. Women receive priesthood authority just like men receive procreative ability, but women can't hold priesthood office in mortality any more than men can give birth.",

It is when you are sealed to the office of God (different than the endowment where you are only promised this).  I would imagine nearly every member of the 70 has had their second anointing and most Mission Presidents, lots of a stake presidents and a handful of bishops.   However you would never know if your bishop had it as you are not allowed to reveal when you receive it, not even to your kids. \n\nPart of the ceremony involves an apostle washing your feat.  Anyway at the conclusion of the ceremony when it all done the husband and wife are invited to participate in what resembles mostly closely a father's blessing IMO.   As the wife has all the priesthood powers that the husband has in this moment she can give her husband a blessing and she does.  This not part of the ordinance but its always done at the conclusion as the wife will never get to use her priesthood again in this fashion until after she dies.   So the husband and wife find a private part of the temple to do it.  The actual ordinance though is performed with an apostle.",

Temple marriage and interviews barely cover half of what the church considers a sin. \n\nRegardless here's a direct Packer quote literally about anecdotal evidence such as yours in regard to the \"rules\" as you would put it:\n\n\"We\u2019ve always counseled in the Church for our Mexican members to marry Mexicans, our Japanese members to marry Japanese, our Caucasians to marry Caucasians, our Polynesian members to marry Polynesians. The counsel has been wise. You may say again, \u201cWell, I know of exceptions.\u201d I do, too, and they\u2019ve been very successful marriages. I know some of them. You might even say, \u201cI can show you local Church leaders or perhaps even general leaders who have married out of their race.\u201d I say, \u201cYes\u2014exceptions.\u201d Then I would remind you of that Relief Society woman\u2019s near-scriptural statement, \u201cWe\u2019d like to follow the rule first, and then we\u2019ll take care of the exceptions.\u201d\n\nAlso, real question: Do you think your uncles marriage would have stood in the first half of the churches latter day existence? Have you done any research on the topic of any interracial marriage church policy in church history? Are you familiar with Brigham Young and his involvement in the literal lynching of a man by fellow church members for pursuing a woman outside of his race? There's lots of documented history on the church website even, it is quite telling that you've chosen to call them untrue before doing any research on the matter.",

You should expect to see more and more resistance to your anti-LGBTQ sentiment throughout your life.\n\nETA: maybe the reason LGBTQ advocates see resistance as an existential threat is because some people literally don't want LGBTQ people to exist. In fact, it was only about 60 years ago when Mormon doctrine asserted that they *didn't* exist, and 50 years ago when BYU ran harmful conversion therapy experiments to make them go away.",

But only from people who called themselves \u201cprogressive,\u201d ironically enough.\n\nCurious though, what \u201canti-LGBTQ\u201d sentiment have I expressed? This is just fascinating to me how most of the responses I\u2019ve gotten are trying to interpret my criticism of this particular methodology as a statement of total defiance against LGBTQ communities and activism as a whole. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t say a single word against the dominant narrative without being typecast as the worst kind of \u201chomophobe\u201d imaginable. This pressure to \u2018conform or die\u2019 is not very compelling, but it is very concerning.\n\n&gt;ETA: maybe the reason LGBTQ advocates see resistance as an existential threat is because some people literally don't want LGBTQ people to exist.\n\nSure. Though the fact of being easily triggered doesn't make that trigger response reasonable.\n\nMore broadly, turning that narrative around and expressing similar intolerance and dogmatism in the other direction is no solution. It seems as though we're not actually interested in building a more tolerant and inclusive society, and instead hoping to simply switch up the power dynamic so our team is the one doing the controlling and suppressing. That doesn't lead to a better world, unless we're selective about which 'kind' of people deserve basic respect.",

As such, things that go against the gospel should not be associated with it.  \nThis will not change for quite some time, if at all.\n\nWe must love everyone equally, regardless of how righteous or unrighteous they may be. This is a commandment from the Lord; Christ sat with sinners, they were welcome with him. He did not condone their lifestyles. he still told them to 'Sin no more', otherwise they could not enter the kingdom.  \n\n\nIt shouldn't be so hard to ask that we do not invade one another's spaces. It's just decent respect. LGBT people have parades, a history month, etc. I disagree with the lifestyle, but I will not infringe on it (few cases excepted).   \n\n\nLikewise, we should treat BYU, again, a symbol for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, legitimately, and a place where LDS students may go.  \n\n\n(P.S.: I totally get that there are some non-LDS people, who don't believe in the doctrines or beliefs of the church, who go to BYU. However, it is still asked of you to act in accordance with teachings of the LDS Church.   \n\n\nThis should not be hard to ask, given the fact that BYU is a ***symbol for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints***)",

However, there are many people who sincerely love Jesus who do not view this display of color as something that goes \u201cagainst the gospel.\u201d \n\nThe nature of the issue is that people in support of LGBTQ inclusion interpret the Gospel of Jesus Christ differently than the Brethren do.\n\nWe all know that the Brethren in the past were wrong to exclude black families from priesthood and the temple. Well, now the Brethren are excluding LGBTQ families. It shouldn\u2019t be hard to see the damage being done by the current man made policies, especially in light of the progress we as a church have made in racial equality.\n\nIt takes courage and Christlike love to defy the status quo like these brave students did with their flashlights, especially when people will accuse them and the marginalized people they\u2019re defending of being unrighteousness or sinners. The Jews accused Christ of blasphemy for what they thought he was doing. We know how that ended.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget who the accuser is in scripture.",

I recognize that analogy is imperfect. But the church effectively telling people that entering into a relationship with someone which cannot be realized under eternal law would lead to grief and confusion. I think a better comparison may be a guy getting into a relationship with a married woman. There is no doctrine that says he cannot kiss her, yet it would not being joy, only grief, no matter how it turns out.",

There are many that are just discovering, or coming to grips with their sexuality at college age. And doing so, and finding themselves in an environment that sponsored discrimination, bans and punishes people for a trait they were born with... It can do a number on ya. Showing support for them can save lives. And if it gets BYU to not ruin kids academic careers for discovering and acting on their sexuality at a normal point in life, well, what's wrong with that?\n\nPeople are born with a skin color. People are born with a preference of sexual partner. Why are we caring about it? Why are we discriminating based on how they were born?\n\nAnd please tell me it was a choice. Because if in your mind, you feel you can choose which you like... Well, I have news for you. You're part of the flag up there. And good on you.",

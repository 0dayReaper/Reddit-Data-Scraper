I don\u2019t see any other courses that would deal with SQL much.\n\nAre some STAT classes exclusive to statistics majors or can I take them as a CS major? Could I possibly take STAT 286 and have the prerequisite waived? I took an R programming course in high school and know Python. I really just want to learn SQL.\n\nIS 302 is literally intro to databases and SQL but it also has prereqs. How does it work taking classes outside your major? Is it possible? If so, surely they don\u2019t expect you to complete the prereqs for a different major.",

Honestly if you understand the math concepts from CS 236 then it\u2019s just a matter of learning SQL syntax which is not very hard imo.",

The data science emphasis adds stats classes so you can gain fundamental stats knowledge. \n\nStats also has a data science emphasis you may want to check out. \n\nData science is a subset of statistics. The more you learn about statistics the better prepared you\u2019ll be for a career in data science. \n\nIn general you\u2019d probably learn the most data science from the stats degree with an emphasis on data science. Next I\u2019d say CS with an emphasis in data science. Lastly I\u2019d say IS. If you know you want to go into a tech subset of data science e.g. A.I. then perhaps you\u2019d favor CS. If you\u2019re more interested in business then perhaps you\u2019d favor IS, but just know you would learn less math and statistical theory from an IS degree. \n\nWith all the questions you have you may want to chat with an academic advisor. I bet Lynette from the CS department would be able to help give advice if you schedule a meeting with her.",

I was one of the last students to take it as a course by itself, and tbh I don't recommend learning SQL from the stats department unless you are particularly interested in data science. The stats department teaches it with querying data in mind and pretty much nothing else, which is great for stats students and not great for anyone else.",

            "comment": "A girl in my math class (who has the integrity to live by her agreement to abide by the honor code, as far as I'm aware) came out as bisexual to all of us in a post about Rainbow Day, informing us about the opportunity to support the LGBTQ+ community by wearing rainbow today, and how it would make her feel loved. Not owning rainbow attire, I responded with a rainbow emoji to show her, personally, as an individual who has an actual human relationship with her, that she is loved. That's my way of showing \"support.\" But I do not feel comfortable parading around campus with rainbow in support of the larger LGBTQ+ community. (Primarily because I don't like the multitudinous interpretations the rainbow banner embodies. It's too loud of a symbol for me to carefully and meaningful communicate my intended message with it in public. I'd rather just decide for myself how to show people love, in ways that make sense to me.)\n\nI'm glad that this day successfully showed some people that they are loved. Truly. However, I can't help but think that those who are concerned for the sake of their fellow man about the loosening of moral standards of society struggle to speak, in fear of receiving hate.\n\nI saw a post on Instagram saying repeatedly that \"support is support\", basically implying that if you're not comfortable waving a rainbow banner around, marching in lockstep with everything that is mainstream, it's because you're not keeping your covenants to love others. (i.e. you are a hateful or ignorant person) The false dichotomy frustrates me deeply.\n\nI guess it just feels unfair that people aren't even willing to have a conversation about how \"support\" can be legitimately defined in this context. Or the fact that two moderately \"loving\" people can respectfully disagree about what it means to \"support\" the LGBTQ+ community. Did the prophet Noah show \"support\" to the people of his day when he preached repentance and warned of the flood? Isn't that the greatest expression of God's love?? Jesus atoned for our sins so that we could repent and be \\*\\*clean\\*\\* AND so that he could succor us in our weakness. It's great that he knows how hard life is for LGBTQ+ people, but the fact is life is hard for everyone, and the need to repent isn't magically waived just because \"it hurts\". Every stinkin' last one of us needs to repent and align ourselves with God's will. It breaks my heart that people leave Jesus and the church and turn into straight up atheists because of the culture (that is thankfully being challenged by things like Rainbow Day) that they aren't welcome because they're gay. (Or for any other reason.)\n\nOn the other hand, the stupid flyers that showed rainbow raindrops being deflected by an umbrella \"in defense of the Family Proclamation\" is anything but loving and inclusive of people who are struggling to feel God's love and the love of others. Maybe the people who made those flyers genuinely (erroneously) thought that Rainbow Day was an affront on God's revealed order of marriage between man and woman. But to those with half a brain, Rainbow Day is about showing LGBTQ+ people that society doesn't hate them, especially within the Church. Do the people at Deznat really think that telling \"apostates\" to \"go to hell\" will be taken as an invitation to \"come unto Christ\"?\n\nI definitely think the Family Proclamation needs to be defended, but I also think it's possible to do so without trampling on the broken hearts of our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters. Some of you might think I'm \"missing the point\" by even bringing up the fact that, yes, the Family Proclamation needs to be defended, but frankly no one can tell me what \"the point is\" when I live in this world, too, and things affect me personally. I'll decide for myself what \"the point is\", thank you very much.\n\nAll of this said, in my heart of hearts, I genuinely hope God would be anything but supportive of me if I chose to ignore his commandments. I strive to be supportive of people (LGBTQ+ and otherwise) in their efforts to improve upon their mortal probation and come unto Christ, because in my mind, there is no better way to support a fellow child of God, for that is how I truly see others.\n\nHappy Rainbow Day [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/9.p12-p16?lang=eng#p12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/9.p12-p16?lang=eng#p12)",

I did not mean to imply anything like that, but I will take this opportunity to clarify that I do not believe that gay people choose to be gay. (At least in the majority of cases.)\n\nHowever, how we choose to act on any proclivity is a choice, one for which all, LGBTQ+ or not, must stand personally accountable.\n\nDoes that make sense? It's not my business whether people take responsibility for their actions, from a moral standpoint. I'm just pointing out that at some point in time, God is going to MAKE us all take responsibility for our actions in light of our understanding of his commandments.\n\nIf one is a member of the LGBTQ+ community, that alone is NOT something that merits repentance. If people think otherwise, then you and I, Kodakal, would agree that they need to think a little harder about what Jesus taught.",

Support means a lot of different things to different people and it seems like there's a large group of people who are all for expressing love, friendship, and acceptance for the LGBTQ community as well as fighting for rights like equality in the workplace, etc. Many of these people, however, do not want to communicate the idea that they support the actions of same-sex romantic relationships or marriages, which symbols like the rainbow could cause people to assume that they believe.\n\nThe same goes in response to your second question: asking if somebody believes that gay men are choosing to ignore God's commandments leaves no room for having the opinion that there is a difference between being gay and acting romantically on those feelings i.e. same sex relationship.\n\nYour final question also puzzles me because consuming caffeinated soda has never been in opposition to the word of wisdom. Furthermore, breaking the word of wisdom is not an equal comparison to engaging in a same sex relationship, when God has stated that sins of a sexual nature are far more egregious than other sins.",

Hell, they could have easily used the positive PR. Something like \"while we didn't approve of this event, we appreciate that our students are so loving\" but nope BYU has to iron fist control its little world. Ugh.",

All these LGBTQ+ people pretending they didn\u2019t agree to attend a private school and complaining about the consequences. As a non-LDS college student attending UVU I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not having to witness students in denial about their religion. Of course it\u2019s the church who is wrong and not you who are pretending they will change policy to make you feel better. Either your religion is true and homosexuality is wrong or your religion isn\u2019t true and you should move on. All of this supposed \u201cpain and anguish\u201d is self imposed. You are all children and it is such a pleasure to not be part of your religion of self hatred.",

The invariable, critical component to cultural Marxism is that it\u2019s incoherent, and can be applied to whatever the fascist, reactionary cunts need to frighten their cults of credulous followers.  \n\n&gt; you're just arguing semantics\n\nWrong again. If the words you\u2019re using are deliberately crafted misnomers used by white supremacist fundamentalists (read: neo-Nazis, deznat) to dilute the meaning of political discourse, they are not semantics. That\u2019s just another catch-all misnomer for shit you don\u2019t understand. \n\n&gt; What you call \"social progress\", I call social degeneration\n\nYou mistake me for someone who is unaware of, or interested in, how the aforementioned fascist, reactionary cunts see themselves, or how they see the societies which must inevitably violently crush them. \n\n&gt; Societies are born, live, and die just like a living organism does. After a society has reached its peak, a common symptom of the downward spiral towards its death is the abandonment of its traditional morals, and often an inversion of those morals\n\nSure. And then the new ones teach basic - but more evolved - history, philosophy, and science to all of their students *not* stupid enough to embrace fascist conspiracy theory, and the forward march continues on, under a different flag. The fascist religious get to keep their coffers, but not their stranglehold on policy. This pseudo-nihilistic thing isn\u2019t particularly daring or playful.",

Nobody ever thinks they are the imprisoned ones, even if they're familiar with the allegory.  My best friend growing up came out as gay right after high school.  Just because I know someone who is gay doesn't mean I have to promote widespread acceptance of that lifestyle.  It also doesn't mean that I stop being friends with him.  I've noticed that most apologists for the lgbtq activists use the argument \"it's just lights on a mountain, bro\".  Why do you downplay their actions, as if there is no significant symbolism to it?  If you want to be a lgbtq ally, don't minimize it.  Own it, and stop being a pussy.",

Why are you all complaining  about attending a private school and hoping they will change policy to make you feel better. By attending alone you are supporting them. Grow up lol",

Maybe there's truth to be had and progress to be made and those two things are not mutually exclusive. \n\nThis post was only to support my LGBTQ+ peers. Working to improve the world and it's many smaller pieces is always a worthy goal, so I don't know why you are mocking people who are doing just that. Seeing a problem, then criticizing those working to fix it is entirely unhelpful.",

Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but isn\u2019t homosexuality considered a sin? How can you expect your church to change course, and if it is the true church why haven\u2019t they already?",

I think you'll find that to be false.  \n\nI think trying to change the course of a church is a fruitless endeavor. I think we agree there. \n\nI just want to help build a place where people feel safe and welcome. That can be done through policy changes *and* social change. The latter is more what I was going for. Just a positive post showing support for my peers.",

By paying to attend you are supporting them continuing to be a private school and as such they have unique rules they are allowed to enforce such as the honor code. I feel for anyone who struggles feeling comfortable but pushing for a policy change in a private school (in my opinion) is as fruitless as tying to change church policy. If you don\u2019t think you will be comfortable or feel uncomfortable seek other options for schooling. Utah has many schools close by that don\u2019t have such rules. I feel that LGTBQ+ individuals end up making all the member population uncomfortable to a degree by essentially demanding BYU change the way they operate and accusing anyone who doesn\u2019t agree of being homophobic. This thread alone is proof of that. BYU doesn\u2019t seem to be a safe space for anyone and both parties are responsible for that",

Lots of REU students come from elsewhere to BYU.\n\nPersonally, I'd probably say to just not bring your coffee/tea into the classroom, keeping it at your place shouldn't be a problem. And shaving isn't as strict as it sounds. As a grad student doing research over the summer, I only got a strong suggestion from my advisor to shave after about a month. If you're not planning on keeping a beard, you should be fine.\n\nDefinitely talk to your research advisor or whoever is running your program before you get there. While they'll probably be understanding and not too strict, it's better to know the expectations beforehand.",

As a research graduate student, idk how often, if ever, you'd go to the TC.\n\nCoffee/tea: i echo the point to leave it at home. If you're going to live with roommates, make sure they're chill with it too. \n\nClothes: unless it's explicit (visual or language), you should be fine. The dress code, particularly for guys, is pretty lax.",

You won't get kicked out for coffee, but people would side-eye you and an anal-rententive member of the might want to press the issue with you.

I also drink coffee, just not as much, but that\u2019s mostly out of preference. However I know a lot of BYU students who do drink coffee, both iced and hot. I actually have conversations with a lot of students my age (18-29ish) about this exact topic. I think what it comes down to is that younger generations of the church are starting to focus more on the core, salvific, and everlasting principles (ie. Love God, love one another, etc.). Plus, a lot of students don\u2019t really see the difference between a 300 mg energy drink vs caffeinated tea.",

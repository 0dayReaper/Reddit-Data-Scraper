            "comment": "Depending on what caused the flat affects how you would repair the tire. If it was just a small puncture and not a pinched tire, first thing that comes to mind is purchasing a bike tire patch/repair kit. They cost ~$5-10 and are great for small holes. If it's a tear from a pinched tire or sidewall damage, then things get more complicated and you're better off purchasing a new tube/tire.\n\nIf you need help removing the tube from the bike or the tire from the frame, just go into the PSC (Project Support Center) on campus. They'll have all the tools you'll need and will be willing to help you out. They're in the basement of the Clyde Building.",

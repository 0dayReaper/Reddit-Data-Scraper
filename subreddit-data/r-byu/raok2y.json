    "postText": "If you're thinking about selling **Door-to-Door pest control** or someone is trying to recruit you, **DON'T** do it, this is from personal experience and will tell you the secrets no one else will.\n\n\n\nFirst of all I've done this previously now and if you are like most rookies you will NOT make the money they tell you, you will make. Remember these guys are salesman and will really persuade you to give it a try and not listen to others who are viewing as a negative experience.\n\n\n\n\nThe way it works is you sell pest control contracts d2d (door to door) they are usually for 1-year and will average a contract value of for example $520. You as a salesman will get a % and usually they start rookies out at 25% (which is terrible by the way) so that's $130 in commissions per sale you will make. The recruiter will sell you this idea you can make $20,000, $40,000, $100,000 in one summer. **Reality is 99% will NOT.** It's a very hard industry you are knocking door to door 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.\n\n\n\nNow that I get out of the way how it works, Let me show you the realty of it and not only MY experience but experience with other friends and coworkers and how we all get screwed and YOU will too.\n\n\n\nSo they will most likely give you a % of 25%, 30% or maybe even a little higher. What they DON'T tell you is if you don't sell and service over 100 accounts or sometimes even 150 accounts you will get a low flat percentage of 18%. This will cost you thousands of dollars. For example if you go out and work your butt off and you finish the summer with 95 accounts serviced. ($520x95accounts = $49,400(18%) you are only making $8,892 this is not including rent, groceries, gas, entertainment, etc. so you will make a LOT less than you would staying home with your parents working for $8-$15/hour. Since they prey on college students or returned missionaries from the LDS church.That is ONLY ONE WAY they will try and screw you over.\n\n\n\nAnother way is if you do happen to go against their favor and you do service over 100 or 150 accounts I've had friends I worked with who didn't even get their commission checks. So the way it works is during the summer you will get only $50 upfront for each serviced accounts and the rest of the commission you will get in the \"backend\" (rest of commission checks later in the year, 2 of them) which usually payout a few months later in November, and January. I've had friends who are out there busting all hot summer for 3-4 months to end up not getting anything. There recruiter will lie and say some of there accounts canceled and it fell below the 150 or 100 accounts serviced. To put in perspective let's say you sold and serviced 150 accounts and you get your $50 for each one ($50x150= $7,500 during the summer) with expectations you are going to get a $15,900 after the summer only to come to find out your recruiter kept all your money then will lie to you that some of your accounts weren't legit or they canceled. Keeping $15,900 of your earned money.\n\n**I had a friend who sold and serviced 198 accounts..** and signed a 35% commission plan, which would of been like $36,000+ he would made (since I don't remember his average contract value) **he ended making only $9,900** ($50 upfront per sale x 198accounts = $9,900) and his recruiter would end up keeping $41,100+ (I figured this since if he only got paid it $9,900 that would be only 10% since he didn't get his backend checks. Since the recruiter can recruit someone and give them a commission deal the recruiter will make the difference of 50%, for example 50%-10%(whatever number they sign a recruit at) = 40% recruiter keeps) we will say he averaged a contract value of $520 x 198accounts = $102,960 revenue (40% recruiter keeps if they screw you over) Recruiter keeps $41,000 and this is how they make their money my screwing over multiple recruits and obviously wanting a couple of them to succeed because they will make override commissions of that recruit but also any recruits they bring on to the team the following summers, almost like a pyramid.\n\n\n**DON'T sell door-to-door pest control**, 99% of the time they will screw you over. They are not in the industry to make it into a career, they are in it to recruit and have unexperienced and uneducated first year reps make their money year after year. Please spread the word and share this post with people who are thinking about doing it. This is how your recruiter is able to afford all the stuff they are showing off to you. (cars, trucks, clothes, gadgets, toys, lifestyle, travelling, etc.) You will be working 12 hour days, 6 days a week to make money for their pockets and since you're a 1099 \"employee\" that signed some pathetic agreement they can get away with this. You should really avoid any sales recruiter If you have any questions comment below or message me. I got screenshots of my previous agreement commission plan and screenshots how I got screwed over and I sold over the 150 amount.  \n\n\nIf you have any experiences similar or know of anyone who this happened to post below. Let's make it aware for others before going out and wasting their summer since some of us have tuition bills to pay, families to support, etc.\n\n**To add:** Aptive and it\u2019s recruiters/team leaders really do be trying to set you up for failure or set the odds against you however you want to look at it. Because they have control on what they put down on the agreement you sign for example.\n\n- 18% if you don\u2019t service over 150 accounts\n- 18% if you switch to a technician (but in reality you won\u2019t get any of it)\n- they keep ALL your money if you leave home early (over 60% of reps do)\n- if you don\u2019t service a minimum of 6 accounts/week you will get written up then fired if it happens again, resulting in your recruiter keeping ALL your money (recruiters will say this is in both our best interest because we don\u2019t want you to be out here if you\u2019re not selling, but just imagine if you have to take a few days off for a wedding or you get sick.. lol)\n- if you go home even a day early from the dates you told them on paper, written you are voiding your contract and they can keep all your money. Even if they say \u201ctalk to us and we\u2019re understanding\u201d don\u2019t believe it, only what\u2019s in writing actually is true. Had it happen to a buddy who went home only 2 days early from his end date and kept ALL his money..\n\n\nStill think I\u2019m only talking about my experience and a personal few other people I know, or maybe that I\u2019m not a good sales rep? Lol If you got time read this: \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.deseret.com/platform/amp/2021/11/23/22776944/inside-the-money-soaked-mirage-of-summer-sales-bro-culture-pest-control-alarms-solar-utah",

Ask me in a DM. \n\nAlmost all other companies start at higher commissions. 18% is a joke, and Aptive tries to sell you on the idea that you\u2019ve gotta pay your dues as a newbie before you deserve access to their exclusive benefits. For pest, 25% is the standard starting rate. Anything less is thievery. If you\u2019re good enough that they want to resign you, 40% base should be the demand. \n\nAptive also uses their contracts as a bludgeon. I was one of the top reps on my team (which was one of the highest producing teams in the country that year), and they still made me sign an agreement the one solitary week I missed quota saying that if I did it again I\u2019d get sent home without a backend. Other companies don\u2019t threaten their own reps like that. Especially the valued ones. \n\nThey also charge a ton of fees from their reps. Other companies provide the iPads, shirts, apartment cleaning, etc. Never paid for any of that after I left Aptive. \n\nThere are a dozen other complaints I have about Aptive that were specific to them. And then I have complaints about sales in general, but everybody has complaints about their job. The money is why it is/isn\u2019t worth putting up with.",

Typically they promise higher commissions and benefits to draw people away from the bigger companies, but rarely have the training or logistics in place for their reps to actually sell well. In my experience, the people who go with new, small companies tend to get sent home quickly because nobody teaches them how to sell and they aren\u2019t making money. \n\nFor experienced sales reps trying to take advantage of a better offer, it might be an okay choice. But those companies also usually don\u2019t stick around for long because their goal is just to get enough active accounts that a company like Terminix or Orkin will buy them out in a few years.",

            "comment": "Ah, Aptive Environmental. I did summer sales with them in Atlanta this past summer for an internship, and I quit after only a month. I didn't work long enough to get paid; I honestly didn't even try to collect my money, because I knew I barely made a dime. But I'm not surprised that you apparently got screwed out of your paycheck, because I *was* there long enough to experience extremely long hours, witness the hazing of new recruits, get told to lie to customers about our product, see our entire group get yelled at by the landlady of our bosses' apartment complex because we were constantly jumping the gates to get in for our morning meetings, and get stopped by the police (let off with just a warning never to return, fortunately) because, whoops, it turns out that those \"no soliciting\" signs *aren't* just for show like they told us! (And continued to tell me afterwards, completely brushing off my concerns about the fact that what they had me doing was flat-out illegal.)\n\nThe moment I got stopped by the police, that was the last straw. I told myself \"screw this\", got in touch with the faculty supervisor for my internship, and spent the rest of my summer doing a separate internship that he set up for me. As of now, Aptive Environmental is no longer allowed to post listings on Nova Southeastern University's job boards, and I like to think that I am the reason why.\n\nI posted [my full story about them](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/nxs5db/aptive_environmental/) over on r/antiMLM, largely because some other digging I did on the company led me to the conclusion that it's not just a scummy summer sales job, it's also a multi-level marketing scheme on top of it. It's not \"almost like a pyramid\", it *is* a glorified pyramid scheme like every other MLM.\n\nMy sales recruiters to watch out for are Hunter Hicks, Parth Sagwan, and Damon Lilly, for the record.",

There are hundreds of companies hiring in person or remote and they pay VERY well. There is stupid money found in software sales. After my stint with Greenix, I was quick to find a new job and found myself making insane money for a 24 year old that included benefits, I didn't have to leave my home town, more time with my wife, and I could finish school. If you can juggle full-time work and 12+ credits, I'd take a look.",

Are these OTHER companies legit and worth it.\n\nIf any and everyone could share experiences on other companies as well and not just aptive that would be great please and much appreciated!

I only make 3k a month but at least it\u2019s guaranteed money and I know it\u2019s not being tampered with. Sounds like hes probably recruiting for his own benefit rather than \u201cgetting me to the next lever financially\u201d they start in April but now im probably telling him I don\u2019t wanna go anymore even tho I gave him some of my important info\u2026",

The only people that go on these forums and trash these companies are people that never had the charisma, work ethic, talent and flat out likability to succeed in sales. All you guys that brag about how you quit because you didn\u2019t want someone to make money off you are freaking stupid. Look at everything around you. The clothes you are wearing, the couch you sit on, the toilet paper you wipe your ass with, somebody made money off everything within your line of sight and that is a great thing! Have an abundance mindset. Money is everywhere and I am happy to have my boss make money on me because why would he invest any time and energy into me if he didn\u2019t make anything. Life is not charity. Every relationship must be mutually beneficial, my boss makes money because of me and I make money because I work with him.\n\nI guarantee that there is not a single person on this thread complaining that has done over 400 pest accounts. It is only those that don\u2019t have the skill that are here to bitch about it. I have worked in many Door 2 Door companies and have never made less than 15k per month in my own personal commission (no overrides) and often I have made 25-30k plus. \n\nThose of you that are complaining why don\u2019t you just get an MBA and work for someone else as a middle manager where you feel like you are doing something important at your 9-5.",

I do agree with you there are probably guys/girls out there who didn\u2019t have the work ethic or drive to do d2d but some of those who commented on my post simply did get screwed out of their money. We\u2019re not necessarily just addressing the problem of someone making money off of us but the fact that some of us didn\u2019t get flat out paid our backends. And like I\u2019ve mentioned for myself or a couple others I\u2019ve worked with we put in the hours and wouldn\u2019t take days off we followed all the rules they stated in the contract and stayed our dates so it\u2019s not like we breached the contract. It\u2019s they screwed us out of our backend and excuses range from accounts canceled to other excuses not to pay us. You might even say well \u201cmaybe you didn\u2019t throw on solid accounts\u201d cmon let\u2019s be real I kept track of all my customers and the ones they sent me that supposedly canceled I would \u201cfollow up\u201d with them and see how services were going and almost all of them didn\u2019t even cancel services that was either Aptive or my Manager making some BS probably just not to pay backends.\n\n\nLet me ask you a question though and I\u2019m not trying to making you look bad or be passive aggressive I simply just want to know what you would choose. Now from what you know let\u2019s say you were a rookie again and they are both the same as far as work culture, great service, etc. both great companies but Company A wants to pay you $90/ per service account you get.\n\nAnd company B wants to pay you the absolute most what they possibly can because they truly want to grow their customer base and they offer you $300/ per services account. Remember everything is the same work culture, great company, great service, both have great managers, the whole 9 yards. \n\nWhich one would you choose?\n\nIt\u2019s not about someone making money off of us it\u2019s that we\u2019re doing a job that requires skill and a good mentality. I\u2019m sorry but no manager should be making a 35% override off of anyone. Lets say you did $520 x 400 accounts at 30% would and get $62,000 when company B would pay you 55% and you make $114,000\u2026 again\u2026 which company would you choose? Do you really want your manager making $52,000 off of you? Which company would you choose @transportationOk6669",

Both took me on dates and acted really smooth and romantic, then started pushing me to move away to sell aptive pest control with them. It raised so many red flags, why do they need me to move away? Why not hire workers who live in the city they are selling to? And why use tinder instead of LinkedIn or craigslist job postings? Made me think the company is a prostituting or human trafficking ring. Oh and one of the guys messaged me asking for a gang bang. I think he was trying to see if I would fuck all of my coworkers to help \"boost morale\" if I got hired",

            "comment": "Aptive Senior Team Lead Here (Recruiter)\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Aptive for 4 years and the things you have explained come down to expectations set by the team lead, not Aptive as a company. Aptive has grown to a 2 Billion dollar company due to those GOOD team leads, and the bad ones will continue to be a liability to themselves, to their reps, and to the company. \n\nMy first year I had my personal team lead who has been great and has set expectations of pay, rent, deductions, and more realistic numbers of what a rep will make. On that same team was another team lead who brought out MULTIPLE reps who did not understand anything expectation wise and ultimately had a bad experience when expectations were never set except the ones saying \u201cyou can make 30k on average\u201d.\n\nAnyone in sales that understands expectations and will read fine print as a rookie, as well as explain fine print as a manager have a huge opportunity to do very well. If they feel they have a knack for talking with people, enjoy hard work (it is extremely hard), and feel that they would do well all things considered I dont think that door to door sales is something to be frowned on, rather bad leadership and signing up with someone without doing your research.\n\nThe Idea of 30k in a summer is attractive to anyone, so a lot of people sign up right off the bat. If you are a recruiter in any way this summer, make sure your reps understand how difficult this job will be in all aspects, mentally, physically, how much training is needed, how much sacrifice is needed, what kind of person succeeds compared to the kind of person that doesn\u2019t. \n\nA company doesn\u2019t stay at the top because of \u201cslimy reps\u201d but every company has bad reps, trainers, and managers. Those people will end up quitting as well. \n\nSales is Amazing in my personal opinion and I love it because I understand what it takes and try to convey that to the new generation. I\u2019ve been able to buy my first house at 23 support me and my wife. My brother and reps are looking at buying real estate this year in their early 20\u2019s, and we all have been on multiple trips together to places like Galapagos, Ecuador, Grand Turk all payed for by Aptive. \n\n\\^\\^ Whoever this person is I feel bad that you had the experience you did, and sadly your team lead is the largest to blame for it. Anyone considering sales that has the entrepreneurial mindset, find the manager that will explain to you every question you have and will go over ALL of the fine print with you. If anyone has any questions for me on all things sales message me. \n\nOff of the soapbox I go, hopefully this helps in some way. Love the sales community lets make it a better place.",

I actually did D2D w Ecosheild last summer for pest control and if I\u2019m gonna be honest I\u2019m glad I did it. Everything they said and promised they delivered so I can\u2019t complain. I\u2019m actually planning on doing it again this summer because Im in college and it really helped me not have to work this year so I can focus on school. I however as a second year won\u2019t sugar coat this shit, it\u2019s HARD. It\u2019s fuckin hard man, you really gotta put your mind and body to the test however I will say no one was slimey or lying to me. Im a big advocate for this company especially just as a little stepping stool to do something big in your entrepreneurial career. Personally I made about 26,000 dollars my first summer, nothing crazy, but I didn\u2019t come in expecting to make 6 figures and drive a lambo. In any industry making 6 figures in 4 months is fucking hard and takes talent so don\u2019t be discouraged by challenges and always make sure you are around honest individuals .",

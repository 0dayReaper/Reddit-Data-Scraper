            "comment": "\\- Personally, and in spite of everything a counselor may tell you, I think it's better to take American Heritage later in your degree. It's a time demanding class and a bit of a Russian roulette when it comes to grading. If you need to keep a certain GPA (i.e. to apply to a certain program, to apply to grad school, to keep a scholarship, etc.) then push it off.\n\n\\-Depending on how comfortable you are with math, then Calc 1 can be time consuming as well.\n\n\\- Unrequested advice: when you say Cell Bio and Physiology, do you mean you are dual majoring? If so, I would very, very strongly recommend you do not do it. There's literally no upside and tons of downsides: no job or grad school application requires two majors; it will likely make you take longer to graduate; it will make your senior year (when you're either trying to network to get a good job or applying to grad schools) MUCH harder; it will make it harder to keep a good GPA; and if you want to graduate in any semblance of a timely fashion, it will eat up your summers with coursework when you should be doing internships (which you'll already have a hard time doing internships that are relevant to two separate majors). Just don't do it. Just pick one major and become a strong job candidate/grad school applicant with one (as opposed to a mediocre applicant with two majors).",

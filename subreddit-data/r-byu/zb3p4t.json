    "postText": "Hi everyone! My name is Chad Huckvale and I\u2019m a student in the linguistics program at Brigham Young University. Working with Dr. Joey Stanley, I am conducting research (IRB Study: IRB2022-343) for my masters thesis on Utah English.\n\nIf you have lived in the state of Utah for **1 or more years in the past 10 years**, please take this survey that I have created which will help me understand how people perceive English is spoken in Utah. The survey should take roughly 10 minutes to complete. There is no payment for participation in this survey.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this study, please email me at [chad.huckvale@gmail.com](mailto:chad.huckvale@gmail.com). Otherwise, feel free to click [here](https://byu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1Mt9PTzhjljmgUS) and begin!",

I've lived in Utah all my life, but I felt like I couldn't differentiate the voices very well into more than two or three groups. \n\nEasy enough to hear an accent of a more rural Eastern/Central Utahn, but I'd be curious to know if there are people who can accurately tell the difference between places like Salt Lake, Cache Valley, and Provo.",

There was a \"General Conference voice\" for both a man and a woman, both a male and a woman USU/ Cache Valley twang, and I marked both a male and woman BYU accent (which was an attempt to speak a non-accented Standard English), and I heard an Orem accent too.\n\nI spent most of the 2010s in Utah, including times living in SLC and Provo and working in Logan.\n\nAnyway, this was very fun to fill out. And these are just my personal theories/ observations.",

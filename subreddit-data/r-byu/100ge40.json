Are there some professors who I should avoid? Are there some professors that you\u2019ve had a good experience with? Any help would be great!",

            "comment": "Depends on what your goal is. If you want to really learn ECON and potentially have your life changed, I can\u2019t recommend Kearl enough. His class is demanding but if you put in the work you can get an A. If you want to take the least demanding class, any other professor would be easier (but interestingly they all have very similar grading distributions). You can even take it through salt lake if you want. \n\nKearl\u2019s class was my favorite at BYU. He\u2019s cantankerous and old school, but he\u2019s the real deal. Strongly recommend especially if you are studying ECON or finance.",

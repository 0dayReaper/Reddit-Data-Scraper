Basically, all I need is 6 credits worth of classes that take basically no time or effort to get an A in. I don\u2019t want to lose my 4.0 GPA by some random class so the more guaranteed of an A the better. Also, if I can take it as on-demand remote even better. Thanks!",

            "comment": "-Most of the student development classes are easy As. \n\n-One that comes to mind is Professional Etiquette where not only the class was super chill and easy, but you actually learned useful stuff for life. \n\n-Even if you aren\u2019t planning to be a lawyer, law lectures is a good option as well, especially because the class is remote. \n\n-Eternal Families with Bro Duncan was remote and very chill.\n\n-Innovation Bootcamp is a 1 credit class that you only attend one Saturday and Thursday the entire semester. If you show up, you pass automatically.",

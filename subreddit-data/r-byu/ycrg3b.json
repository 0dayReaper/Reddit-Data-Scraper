Remember to focus on the things which make you stand out and focus less on the things which every other high school graduated has done. Just an example: almost every guy and their dog who applies to BYU is an eagle scout, but not everybody did the same eagle scout project. So rather than just listing yourself as an eagle scout, list one of your accomplishments as \"I  went to X companies and received $X in donations to successfully plan and execute ______ project\" or something along those lines.",

    "postText": "Okay, kind of just putting this out here for posterity but also honestly curious, does anybody else's family get visited by Happy the New Year baby? Because mine does and I'm convinced that only those closely related to me also have experienced this. We leave out plates (usually by a fireplace) and he leaves us a toy or whatever other back-ordered Christmas presents my mom has in store. Each child puts out one plate, very similar to stockings for Christmas, but instead plates for a New Year Baby. Where is this tradition coming from?? Hoping somebody else at BYU has experienced this.",

            "comment": "Soviet Russia used to have this tradition instead of Christmas. You\u2019d put up a New Year\u2019s tree and then Father Time and the New Year\u2019s Baby would deliver gifts to good children. It was the closest thing the Soviet regime has to a religious holiday. So perhaps that is one origin of the Holiday. \n\nAlso of note is in the medieval period they were 12 days of Christmas, which were celebrated, which meant several of the celebrations went into January. Ultimately culminating in a grande feast on 7 January, which was celebrated as 12th night. so this also might be the origin of your families, post-Christmas celebration.\n\nThe orthodox church doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas until about the same date so if your family comes from Eastern Europe, they may have influenced by that as well.\n\nEither way, merry Christmas and happy new year .",

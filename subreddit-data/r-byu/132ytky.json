I don\u2019t know much about Michaelis (he wasn\u2019t teaching Ochem the year I took it), but I\u2019d guess that low reviews are largely due to the extremely hard subject matter. Hopefully someone else responds who has had experiences with both. \n\nOchem required me to make some serious thinking adjustments to understand, plus there\u2019s an insanely high amount of rules and such to memorize. I\u2019m willing to bet any ratemyprofessor for Ochem is going to be rough because of the nature of the subject and how many non-chemists are required to take it.",

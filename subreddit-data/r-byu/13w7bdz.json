I know where a couple motorcycle lots are but I\u2019m not aware of anything close to the side of campus that the Benson/Nichols buildings are at. Any suggestions or am I just going to have to park a ways away?",

During the school day your best bet for parking would probably be behind the Clyde building. Here you won\u2019t need to walk up the stairs of doom, if you get to campus somewhat early parking should be easy. There are also lots of parking spots inside the LSB parking garage that never really get used up, from there you can take the stairs or elevators up to the benson. (Bonus here is they are covered for winter months)\n\nSource: Road a moped on campus for a couple years",

            "comment": "It\u2019s been a couple of years since I took FIN 201, but  when I took it, Brau only grades 4 exams. No homework, quizzes, projects, etc. He also provides pretty good study guides for them. There\u2019s still homework to get familiar with the material, but it\u2019s for your own benefit and not a part of your grade. I regularly did the hw and reviewed the study guides and notes from class, and when exam time came around, I got 97s on them except for the final. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t the best exam taker, then Holmes may be better as he has other graded assignments aside from exams that may offset poor exam scores.",

The exams really kicked my butt because I didnt do all the work I should have, I ended up with a B.  Definitely doable to get higher though. I don't know anything about Holmes, but if you're willing to put in the work Brau is a great professor.  I also really enjoyed his spiritual thoughts and professional development sections of each lecture.",

            "comment": "I took Brau and enjoyed his class. He's a great professor, but with an entry level large class like this with almost identical teaching material, I don't think one will be dramatically better than the other in terms of delivering content. The big thing to consider is, as mentioned before, Brau grades entirely off of exams, while Holmes takes into account other assignments. This can act as a buffer if you don't do well on exams, or seem like busy work if you kill it on exams, and that's the main thing to balance",

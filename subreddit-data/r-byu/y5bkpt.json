    "postText": "Hello, all! I am current in my undergraduate education, but I'm planning early, and I think BYU might be a good grad school fit for me. I just have a few questions, and I was hoping someone could help me out. \n\n1. How difficult is it, in reality, to get admitted as a grad student (Master of accounting degree), and what can I do to strengthen my application \n2. Although I have no issue with Mormonism, I am not a Mormon, in fact, I am a southern baptist. As a grad student, do they make you take religious classes that pertain to the Mormon religion?\n3. Is Provo, and the surrounding area, a good place to start life after grad school?\n\nIf anyone could answer these questions and offer other helpful information, that would be great! Thanks so much, and have a good night!",

Even in the school of music, it really seems to depend on the specific program you are applying to within that school.\n\n2 - I don\u2019t think you need to take any religion courses. Most if not all students will share the majority of your beliefs, and if it ever comes up that you\u2019re baptist, most students I know would think that\u2019s pretty cool and either tell you about baptists they met on their mission, or else ask you about your religion/culture.\n\nI don\u2019t like Provo on account of it being pretty packed with students and too many people in general. That said, this semester my wife and I moved to springville (bout a 20 minute drive) and I honestly love it out here. Was not considering staying in UT before, but now I am. It\u2019s quieter and more peaceful out here, but we still have easy access to BYU and other amenities in Provo.",

            "comment": "Can't really answer #1. It's a selective program, that's all I know.\n\nFor #2, I would tell a non-LDS student to think long and hard if they're willing to live according to the beliefs of another church. That means no coffee, alcohol, or other things normally fine for Baptists. Culturally, you'll probably get along with most people just fine. \n\nAs a masters student, you won't have to take religion classes. You'll just have to deal with the ocasional person that tries to convert you.\n\nFor #3 I'd argue no. Utah Valley has very bad air quality in the winter and Utah as a whole has water problems. You'll probably find work just fine and even meet great people. It's a desert though that isn't for everyone.\n\nI enjoy BYU a lot. I'm taking a few masters classes in the engineering program right now, and can tell it really is mostly for undergrads. I do love my classes though. The business school has quite good masters programs, so you'll probably really enjoy them if you attend here.",

            "comment": "1) masters of accounting might be more difficult to get admitted to when compared with other programs, since BYU's accounting program is one of the best in the country. It's hard to say.\n2) everybody else already answered this: no, you won't have to take religion classes as a masters student.\n3) It really depends on what you're looking for. Provo, just like anywhere else, has its pros and cons. It's a good place to raise kids (very family-friendly and overall a good social environment) if that's something you want to do. It'd be good socially right after finishing your master's because there are a lot of former BYU students who stick around in the area after graduation, so you're likely to meet more people your age than you would in other places. Finding a good job in the area wouldn't be difficult right now. I'd say that the area around Provo is a good spot to settle after you finish your schooling. Things will be different for you because you're not LDS-- much of the social atmosphere revolves around church. I don't think it'd necessarily be a bad experience, but you would religiously and therefore culturally be in a small minority.",

            "comment": "For number 3, most of Utah has a problem with making non-mormons feel othered, and provo is the epicenter of that. At least that's what I've heard from non-mormons while I served here as a missionary. I know there are a lot of people out there that really want to change that, but there's some cultural things that you won't be able to change without getting rid of the entire church. \n\nIf you want to live here, you'll have to get used to (*very* subtle) judgment from people if you choose to drink coffee, tea, or alcohol.",

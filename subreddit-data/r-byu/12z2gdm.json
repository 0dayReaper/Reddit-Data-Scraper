I know most recently it was located on Freedom Blvd by Taylor's Bike Shop for a couple years, and then moved to Center Street in May 2020 where it's been ever since. Their Center Street location was actually the same location as the old Oregano Italian Kitchen restaurant, which was a different restaurant also started by the same person from several years earlier! They just recently opened a new location in Orem a few months ago that also offers pizza making classes",

If you\u2019re looking for the best provo pizza experience, it\u2019s slab 7/10 times. The other three times are because you needed Two Jacks (commendable), are either going to dinner with your roommate who served in Italy or your rich boss so you go somewhere \u201cauthentic,\u201d or because your well-intentioned grandpa is in town and takes you to Brick Oven. Nothing wrong with any of them, but if I\u2019m choosing for myself it\u2019s Slab or Two Jacks\n\nEdit: I guess I\u2019m old because I don\u2019t remember Fat Daddy\u2019s being there a few years ago.

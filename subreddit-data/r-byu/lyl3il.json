Hear me out:\n\nThe committee on race made, along with their other recommendations, a recommendation to review campus policies which may disproportionately affect people of different races. This plays into removing the beard rule for two reasons: \n\n1) pseudofolliculitis, the primary reason you can qualify for a beard card, primarily affects black people (upwards of 60% of black men according to a brief internet search), meaning they have to go through the painful process of getting a beard card at much higher rates (and they have to pay for it).\n\n2) some races have thicker facial hair than others. I'm of Irish/English descent, and when I shave it takes around two days for my 5 o'clock shadow to really become noticeable due to my light hair color. On the other hand, I have friends of Italian/Middle Eastern descent who have super thick, coarse, dark facial hair. They would look like they haven't shaved for 3 days if they waxed their face. That means that they will get turned away from the Testing Center even if they shaved in the Testing Center bathroom. Disparate impact.",

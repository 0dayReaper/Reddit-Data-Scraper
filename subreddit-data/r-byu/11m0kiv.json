It fosters a much more vibrant student community than at a more commuter oriented school like U of U. \n\nNewer developments around Joaquin and beyond typically have private rooms and other amenities that allow for a better quality of life, and theoretically should limit the necessity for 6 people sharing a bathroom and what not. There should be regulations in place to limit the power of predatory management companies, but overall I think the density of student housing is a net positive.",

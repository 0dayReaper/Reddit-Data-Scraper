            "comment": "It's really important to note the, \"cannot exceed 20 hours per week while school is session.\" You can work more in the spring/summer if you paperwork is in order but as long as you are \"in school\" you can only work the 20 hours. (They mostly say 19.5 hours for purpose.) If you go over 20 you'll be terminated automatically in the BYU System. \n\nIt should be noted that you cannot work an MTC job as an International Student even if they are on the BYU Jobs lists they fall in a different employment category.",

None of the forms require anything more of an applicant than is expected of a student. Many students of many faiths work in various departments at BYU. An interviewer may have personal bias in the hiring process and BYU is exempt from some federal hiring requirements because it is a religious school but that tends to only affect full time staff and faculty hiring.",

TA pay differs by major from what I understand but most have a pay raise each semester you stay so that\u2019s good if you\u2019re looking long term. I used to work custodial and they messaged me not long ago saying it was now paying $13.40 per hour. Be aware, many of the custodial positions are very early morning or late in the evening. I worked afternoons though.",

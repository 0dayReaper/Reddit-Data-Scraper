    "postText": "Hey friends,\n\nI'm trying to find some off-campus housing to live in for the 2023-24 school year. I like the place I live in now but with rent/utilities/parking etc my total comes out to $540 a month, which is just too much for me lol. Any suggestions for student housing complexes near campus that are a bit cheaper?\n\nI've also heard of some people having luck with getting a few friends and renting a small house. Any tips on making that work and is it worth it?\n\nEdit- I\u2019m a dude looking for a shared room.",

There are some places with private rooms that are cheaper than $500 but they\u2019re a little bit from campus (carriage cove, branbury, crest wood etc)",

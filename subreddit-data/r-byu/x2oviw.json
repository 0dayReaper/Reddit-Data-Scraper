    "postText": "Before you question whether or not someone yelled a racial slur at a BYU game, ask how we got to a point where it\u2019s ok to chant Lets Go Brandon on campus, because that was never ok in my time.\n\nI spent 12 years at BYU (96-2008) and I never even heard someone say screw Bill Clinton. Everyone hated him but no one thought it appropriate to cuss him out.",

            "comment": "High on the list of things young Latter-day Saints are infamous for is their preference for replacing swear words with innocent-sounding alternatives.\n\nWith \"Let's go Brandon\" becoming popular nationwide, it was practically inevitable that it would catch on in Utah, where people are already keen on the idea of suggesting swear words without actually using them. The humor in this particular slogan makes it even more effective.\n\nAnd of course, our political culture is increasingly divided. As people become more connected over social media, national/global trends will continue to infiltrate, and in many cases pollute, the former \"bubble\" of Utah/Provo, as we continue to see from both sides of the political aisle.\n\nOf course that doesn't make it okay or good; I just think the whole thing is fascinating.\n\nChurch leaders' counsel in favor of uplifting speech and civil discourse remains as relevant as ever before, if not more so.",

It is also super against the AIM\u2019s of BYU in my opinion. It was something I am still frustrated about because it is so demeaning towards someone else. But it\u2019s still good to question this racial slur thing, because if it was a misunderstanding, then we want to know so both parties can be reconciled.",

Maybe that part hasn\u2019t made it to campus yet due to the church\u2019s large number of members who are minorities, but political discourse in Provo is not heading in the right direction.",

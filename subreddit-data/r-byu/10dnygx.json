You pretty much have to be academically perfect in order to get it.\n\nUnless you have no other way to pay for college, you might want to think twice about academic scholarships like this one. You have to maintain a certain number of credit hours and a certain GPA (for most of them, Idk about this one). Depending on your major, they might be unhealthy standards for you to try to meet for all four years of college. Sometimes it's not worth destroying your mental health over.",

If you are excited about being in an envoloping LDS environment with like-minded people and open to religious topics being somewhat pervasive (at least on a relative basis) on campus, you will probably enjoy BYU more than any place in the world (thus BYU's spot atop the list of top yield percentages of universities). If you wince a bit when someone offers a prayer in an otherwise secular environment with lots of non-LDS people around, and you are unsure of your desire to stay deeply involved with the church long term, BYU may not be the best place to commit 4 years.",

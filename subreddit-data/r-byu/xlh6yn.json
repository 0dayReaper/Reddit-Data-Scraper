    "postText": "I am applying for a graduate program for next fall and have a question about the honor code. How strict is BYU on girls only having one pair of piercings? I have 6 piercings total; am I going to have to wear retainers for the 2 years I\u2019m in school or could I possibly get away with small earrings? I feel like I\u2019ve seen a few of my friends who are at byu and have multiple piercings so that\u2019s why I\u2019m wondering if they are more relaxed with that rule.",

I don't think I knew anyone with more than 3 though.\n\nI suspect that wearing small earrings and not intentionally drawing attention to them will work just fine the best majority of the time. There may be a few instances where you have to take them out one in a while (testing center) but presumably that wouldn't be too big of a hassle?",

For example if you publicly post a picture on social media wearing a tank top or several piercings nobody will bat an eye, but if you post pictures online of you drinking then you'll get called into the honor code office to discuss. It's possible you might have a professor ask you to take them out when coming to their class or it might never happen, but it is not like there are people roaming campus enforcing the dress code.",

They only really check/care at the ID center on campus, and the testing center, from personal experience. Could be different for Grads but I wouldn't imagine it being very different or more strict. If you are nervous about it, I think you could definitely get away with some smaller earrings or ones that are more simple.",

    "postText": "Hey BYU redditors,\n\nI've taken cycling, weight training, and running but want something more intense for next semester. I usually do the Insanity videos in the summer so something that level of exercise would be good! The long and short of it is that all the classes I've taken are not intense enough and I want to actually get my heart rate up 9 classes out of 10. What were the most physically challenging SWELL classes that yall have taken?\n\nEdit: I was thinking about Pilates but wasn't sure if that would be intense because I've never done it before.",

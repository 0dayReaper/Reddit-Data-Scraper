Having the option to escape some of Provo's crummy landlords that are dependent on exploiting the never-ending supply of students is nice.\n\nI think parking on campus is definitely going to be interesting as the housing change may lead to more students commuting in from further out. Doesn't help that the new music building took out some of the already limited parking.",

They're condos and owned individually so you can have a different landlord depending on which unit you sign with. Aspen Ridge owns a lot of them but I would recommend trying to get a contract with literally any one else.",

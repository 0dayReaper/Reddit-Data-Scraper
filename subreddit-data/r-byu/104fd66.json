There are surely courses that will be difficult regardless of university, and perhaps even some that are more challenging at UVU or BYU-I than BYU itself.",

At BYU-I, my classes were smaller and my professors more intimate. They had an easier time tailoring things to us. Also, I felt like they didn't take themselves so seriously. They weren't there for the prestige, they were at BYU-I for the passion. \n\nMy experiences are about ten years old or so, though.",

For example, a higher GPA at a school with low exposure doesn\u2019t help with your job search or graduate applications.  Small schools don\u2019t expose you to faculty doing cutting edge research in areas of your interest.  Higher profile schools expose you to more job recruiters, post-grad networking, study abroad and on an on.  \n\nAlways trade the higher GPA for the better school.",

I\u2019ve taught many students retaking statistics for the third time trying to be business majors.  This creates an upward inflation of necessary effort on the part of students and a downward pressure against grade inflation (see above for scraping by) which creates the so-called weeded courses.  Does BYU-I have majors like this?  Do scores of bright students fail weeders every semester at BYU-I like at BYU?\n\nAlso, the course catalogs of BYU and BYU-I are not the same.  Can you even take Computational Analysis of Complex Genomes at BYU-I?  Some areas of BYU-I have respectable course offerings, especially for a small undergraduate uni.  But at BYU faculty regularly teach graduate and undergraduate courses and their expectations are higher because of it.  Advanced students also often take graduate level course as seniors or just roll right into graduate programs their senior year.  So on that measure BYU is harder because the \u201chard stuff\u201d doesn\u2019t even exist at BYU-I.\n\nI could go on, but the point is that yes, BYU is harder than BYU-I, and UVU, and USU, and SUU and is much more comparable to a UofU, UCLA, or other large East/West coast state school.  BYU/BYU-I is a completely apples to oranges comparison in almost every regard.\n\nFor anyone looking to transfer from \u201cI\u201d you need to have every aspect of your scholastics in top shape.  To be a top student there you must realize that top BYU students are trying to get into Harvard Business school or top medical schools, or top law programs, or top graduate studies programs.\n\nI have not attended both.  I attended BYU for undergrad and grad, Eastern Big10 for doctorate, have taught at a small undergrad similar to BYU-I.",

In my experience, none of my peers or advisors really understood the difference between BYU-I and BYU. They see the \u2018BYU\u2019 and make the assumptions they already have programmed. They knew that \u2018BYU\u2019 has a good rep for academic rigor. The thing is, as we know, BYU and BYU-I are very different. I would not have received the GPA I received at BYU-I at BYU. I probably would not have received letters of recommendation from the professors I knew personally if I attended the much larger program at BYU-I. It was much easier to set myself apart at BYU-I, which, in turn, improved my grad school applications\u2019 strength. I\u2019m surprised more people don\u2019t take advantage of what BYU-I has to offer (low cost of living, small class sizes, qualified professors who do not have the pressure of research looming over them, professors who want to teach and almost always have real-world work experience, etc.) As long as they plan on attending graduate school elsewhere. Networking for work after a BA from BYU-I is a nightmare given the remote location of the school, especially since hoards of student are not from Idaho/Utah.",

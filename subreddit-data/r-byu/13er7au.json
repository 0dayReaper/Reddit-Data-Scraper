Here\u2019s a secret about college, you don\u2019t get in trouble for being late to class. Well, there are some classes you might have problems with but for the most part, you\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve gotten into the (very very bad) habit of not attending classes that are early in the morning and aren\u2019t dependent on attendance (such as a math class taught straight from the textbook, I can do that on my own time and in the comfort of my own house)",

But you might need to hustle just a little bit your first couple of days until you feel more comfortable getting between writing 150 and American heritage haha",

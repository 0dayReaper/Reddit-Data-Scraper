    "postText": "I am currently attending U of U as a freshman and am looking to transfer. I seriously want to know the difference between the schools? Without all of the rivalry crap. I am a non-member, heavily tattooed (not visible if I wear pants and long sleeves), but I am totally down with LDS members.\nA few general questions I have are, how might I be perceived? I wear shorts often so my tattoos will be visible. A little childish, but how would dating be for me, being clearly a non-member? I would preferably date a LDS member as, after dating different types of girls, they seem to be the best fit for myself. What GPA would I need to get in as a transfer, any advice with the application? I have a good GPA right now, I just want to know if I should work really hard or what. Finally, what should I keep in mind as a transfer, anyone went through the same transfer? Any info would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",

You've gotta work hard for good grades, but you'll get a great education. \n\nOn the social side, numerous people will try to convert you to their faith while you're there. While LDS girls would go on a few dates with you, most (but maybe not all) are going to struggle with the idea of getting serious with someone who doesn't share their faith. At BYU, most people's goal for dating is to end up married, often before they graduate, and LDS people are taught to marry people who share their faith so they can be married in the LDS temple. \n\nA minority of people may judge you for your tattoos, but they're not the type of people worth hanging out with anyway.",

            "comment": "* [BYU transfer requirements](https://enrollment.byu.edu/admissions/transfer-applicants), you'll need a 24+ credits, and there is no official transfer GPA requirement (but i've heard multiple people say 3.5 GPA).\n* Tuition at BYU is subsidized by tithing of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. With this the school has different tuition rates for **Latter-day Saint** and **Non-Latter-day Saint** students. Non-Latter-day Saint tuition is about double (per year) the tuition of University of Utah Tuition for Utah residents, but about 1/3 less than Non-Resident tuition.\n* The education you will get in many classes (non-religion classes) will still be infused with the beliefs and teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n* The quality of education would come down to your major. You will want to lookup rating for the professors in your field of study at both universities. Some majors will have a clear \"winner\" and program. Examples: Dance has a world renown program at BYU that often wins awards and dominates in competitions. Pre-Med programs are considered to be much better at the U.\n* Dating: BYU has a higher percentage of married students with a similar size student body means there is a smaller dating pool, but you are looking at only about 11,000 potential daters instead of 13,5000.\n   * My best advice is try to go on dates instead of a focus on dating towards marriage. Those that go on dates and are very clear that you are not trying to find someone to marry after the 3rd date (using a stereotype here) get more dates than those that that are using dating solely as a means to marriage. I've been married 14 years and been away from BYU more than that so the dating scene might have changed since i was there, but i doubt it changes that much on this point.\n   * For looking at more informal hang-out than going on a date, I'd suggest plan a group something-or-other (board games, you and roommates cooking dinner for a girls apartment, the rodeo) for BYU. Don't know what it is like at the U.\n   * Participate in the ward, and ward activities, your roommates are attending for church. Go as much as you feel comfortable. The activities will be a good way to be involved and it would be quite good for those from the ward to be more exposed to other world-views than just the bubble many will have come from. I was one of those bubble folk who thought they were not. I still learn things now that shows me i was more in the bubble than i thought.",

Most girls will probably be looking for someone who has the same \u201cbackground\u201d, meaning faith. \n\nGood luck in transferring and I don\u2019t think they have a set GPA cutoff for transfers but I\u2019m sure everything over 3.6 will be enough to show that you can handle the academics.",

            "comment": "Is there a program that BYU offers that you are really interested in? Honestly if you're just looking to date LDS girls there are plenty of ways to do that without attending BYU. It's not that people really would give you hard time for the tattoos but it seems excessively complicated to apply to a new school if you're trying to get a date. However, if there is a program you're really wanting to get into at BYU then I could see moving to the school. Because BYU has an enrollment cap though admissions will want to know why specifically BYU fits your educational plan and to be honest why they should choose you over admitting someone who is LDS. Additionally if you are leaving UofU because of the rigor of the classes you are not going to find BYU easier.  UVU or USU are both good schools as well and have a lot of LDS folks attending those places as well which would give you the culture you may want and be a little less academically challenging.",

            "comment": "The first thing to note is BYU and BYU-Idaho has something called the honor code. Even though you are a non-member, you will be required to attend church at least once a month(to be considered \u201cactive\u201d), as well as follow main commandments like the Word of Wisdom(no drugs, coffee, black/green leaf teas, alcohol, etc), and the law of chastity(no sex before marriage, no porn, no masturbation, no lgbtq actions). Tattoos aren\u2019t *technically* against the commandments so you might catch some judgement from people. If you don\u2019t care about any of that, see below.\n\nFrom my experience at BYU-Idaho with other students, people don\u2019t care whether you are a member or not. There\u2019s always gonna be \u201cthat guy\u201d but most people mind their business and are pretty respectful..\n\nIn regards to dating, I dunno since I haven\u2019t been in the dating scene for a few years but I\u2019d assume plenty of girls/guys on campus who wouldn\u2019t mind going on dates with you but I could see you running into people having the expectation for you to join the church if things got serious and we\u2019re heading towards marriage.\n\nNot sure about GPA but since BYU is a competitive school since almost all active members of the church want to attend, I would try to make it as high as you could(3.5+).\n\nI\u2019ve never transferred and I still attend BYU-Idaho but best of luck!!",

I would strongly advise you not to go there, especially if you're not religious. Even as a member of the church, returned missionary etc, I felt like an outsider there because I didn't believe the teachings of the church or attend regularly.

Something to consider is that after you are accepted to BYU, you then have to apply into the Business school for the major. If rejected from the Business school do you have a contingency plan? Would you be ok with going to BYU and not graduate with a business degree?\nI think that the general mood at BYU is shifting, at least from what I see. Girls might be more open to dating outside of the church. You can always get on Mutual or Tinder for dates.",

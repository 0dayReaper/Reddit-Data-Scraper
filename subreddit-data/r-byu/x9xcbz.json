Had a teacher tell me to start losing my accent because it\u2019s not professional. Entered the bus talking to my mom and a guy said: ugh spanish speakers again. Came out of ceramics class heading to my building with paint on me and a guy from heritage halls asked: hola? When are y\u2019all done with construction so y\u2019all can leave this country. All of this was freshman year and almost made me actually leave this country lol",

When I lived for two years in Romania, people expected me to learn the language and not speak English loudly in public, and it was expected that I do my best to lose my American accent in Romanian.",

However, I think it\u2019s ridiculous to expect them to lose the accent. A lot of that is dependent on how old someone was when they arrived, how long they lived there, and just how their brain works. It\u2019s not something done consciously, at least not by most. Even when people try, it doesn\u2019t tend to stick, and usually doesn\u2019t sound very authentic.",

Losing an accent is very difficult, and to my understanding, sometimes impossible.\n\nThat said, there\u2019s a big difference between the accent of someone first learning a language, and the accent of someone who has mastered it. Most people who really nail down the grammar and vocabulary also eventually master the sound of most words, leaving only a subtle accent that does not significantly impact intelligibly.",

No one but him knows who they were talking about but he likely still felt the hurt and anxiety accompanied with those kinds of personal attacks. In a fair world BYU (and Duke?) would be offering to pay for the counseling this guy might need. Though, in a fair world, none of this would have happened in the first place so I guess that\u2019s a moot point.\n\nThis next bit isn\u2019t related to your post but I\u2019m on a rant now, sorry! \n\nI\u2019m even more frustrated that so much social pressure was put on BYU to find someone to punish immediately before a real investigation could even be carried out. They shouldn\u2019t have caved to pressure, but at the same time that could appear like indifference to something as serious as racism. \n\nOur culture has become so toxic that if someone accuses you of anything you\u2019re immediately branded as a bad person (or group, in this case). Even if investigation finds the accusation to be false, most people outside of BYU won\u2019t remember or even see the news that clears the fan\u2019s and BYU\u2019s names in this case. The accusation however won\u2019t likely be forgotten any time soon.",

Why would the fan think someone wearing a Duke uniform was a BYU player?  Especially since there aren't any black players on the BYU team (edit: I think this is true)?  BYU likely banned the fan because his story didn't add up.\n\nhttps://www.sltrib.com/sports/byu-cougars/2022/09/09/timeline-byu-duke-volleyball/\n\nI'm not claiming that either side is telling the truth.  I am  saying that both sides deserve to be treated innocent until proven guilty.  BYU and the fan were treated as guilty based on one person's claim and that was wrong.  People claiming Rachel lied with malicious intent without evidence of malicious intent is also wrong.  \n\nHowever, I think you are under selling the damages.  Not to the fan.  Missing two weeks of in person college sports during the off season isn't much of a hardship.  But BYU's reputation was damaged because of the incident.  They have a case to prove damages.  But I haven't seen any evidence of malicious intent.",

And racism sadly still exists.  But claiming the modern LDS religion is racist is a stretch at best.  The church has made great strides in moving the center of its teachings to a very color-blind place.  If anything, a pretty good case could be made that Joseph Smith and the early LDS church doctrine was very progressive when it came to race, and that these teachings got derailed by Brigham Young, a problem that because of pre-Civil War politics, the politics of gaining statehood, internal Utah politics, and inherent racism in the general population of the time (both LDS and non-LDS) - which took 100 or so years to correct.  The whole country was still struggling with the issue almost 100 years after the Civil War, so it's not surprising the LDS community was as well.\n\nBut to say that the religion is racist sounds more like personal bias than reality.",

The fan doesn\u2019t have any fundamental right to be at a volleyball game. And once the investigation ends and there\u2019s no evidence to support the claim? Lift the ban.\n\nNow, I would agree that publicizing the fan\u2019s name during the investigation would be entirely inappropriate. But that\u2019s not what happened here.",

Even if their name wasn't widely revealed you can bet they've been harassed.\n\nSecondly, their reputation will probably never fully recover.  Plenty of people will have heard about the ban but far fewer people will ever hear about the reversal of the said ban.  Accusations always go on page one of the newspaper, but retractions get buried, that's just historical fact.\n\nEverything you said goes completely against what America stands for.

That\u2019s why judges now typically issue restraining orders (an interim measure) while the criminal case is pending. Those restraining orders are based on probable cause, which is usually no more than the alleged victim\u2019s testimony.\n\nWhile the stakes aren\u2019t as high for harassment claims, that doesn\u2019t mean interim measures aren\u2019t appropriate. If this fellow had really shouted the n-word at Black players, that is actual harassment and he shouldn\u2019t be at BYU volleyball games. The \u201charm\u201d from the suspension was minimal and can be made up with free tickets to the next game. BYU didn\u2019t publicize the guy\u2019s name, and as soon as the investigation was concluded they lifted the ban.",

The mental space one must occupy to think that this is more common than it is in today's world is quite shocking. The demand for racism is greater than the supply.

If the incident hadn't been plastered all over the front page of the news, it would be pretty simple -- Richardson would just offer a formal apology to the university and to the banned fan, and everyone would move on with life.\n\nUnfortunately, that's not the case anymore. This entire debacle developed a life of its own after being plastered all over the news. A retraction from Richardson (even if it's just saying, \"Yeah, I must have heard something else\") would be inviting even more abuse from the myriad keyboard warriors that are already labeling her the new Jussie Smollett. I can understand, even if I don't agree with it, why she might not retract her story.",

Federal officials found evidence that Trump had refused to rent to Black tenants and lied to Black applicants about whether apartments were available, among other accusations. \n\n1980s: Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump\u2019s Castle, accused another one of Trump\u2019s businesses of discrimination. \u201cWhen Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt was the eighties, I was a teenager, but I remember it: They put us all in the back.\u201d\n\n1989: Trump takes out full page ad accusing the Central Park 5 of being guilty of a crime they were later proved innocent of by DNA evidence. Trump says many years later, when confronted with their innocence \u201cthey must be guilty of something\u201d. All five are Black or Latino.\n\n1991: A book by John O\u2019Donnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump\u2019s criticism of a Black accountant: \u201cBlack guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. \u2026 I think that the guy is lazy. And it\u2019s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It\u2019s not anything they can control.\u201d Trump later said in a 1997 Playboy interview that \u201cthe stuff O\u2019Donnell wrote about me is probably true.\u201d\n\n1992: The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino had to pay a $200,000 fine because it transferred Black and women dealers off tables to accommodate a big-time gambler\u2019s prejudices.\n\n1993: Trump makes disparaging remarks about Native Americans to a congressional hearing.\n\n2000: In opposition to a casino proposed by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe, which he saw as a financial threat to his casinos in Atlantic City, Trump secretly ran a series of ads suggesting the tribe had a \u201crecord of criminal activity [that] is well documented.\u201d\n\n2005: Trump publicly pitched what was essentially The Apprentice: White People vs. Black People. He said he \u201cwasn\u2019t particularly happy\u201d with the most recent season of his show, so he was considering \u201can idea that is fairly controversial \u2014 creating a team of successful African Americans versus a team of successful whites. Whether people like that idea or not, it is somewhat reflective of our very vicious world.\u201d\n\n2010: In 2010, there was a huge national controversy over the \u201cGround Zero Mosque\u201d \u2014 a proposal to build a Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan, near the site of the 9/11 attacks. Trump opposed the project, calling it \u201cinsensitive,\u201d and offered to buy out one of the investors in the project. On The Late Show With David Letterman, Trump argued, referring to Muslims, \u201cWell, somebody\u2019s blowing us up. Somebody\u2019s blowing up buildings, and somebody\u2019s doing lots of bad stuff.\u201d\n\n2011: Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama was not born in the US. He claimed to send investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama\u2019s birth certificate. Obama later released his birth certificate, calling Trump a \u201ccarnival barker.\u201d research has found a strong correlation between birtherism and racism. But Trump has reportedly continued pushing this conspiracy theory in private.\n\n2011: While Trump suggested that Obama wasn\u2019t born in the US, he also argued that maybe Obama wasn\u2019t a good enough student to have gotten into Columbia or Harvard Law School, and demanded Obama release his university transcripts. Trump claimed, \u201cI heard he was a terrible student. Terrible. How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard?\u201d\n\nThese were all before he ran for president. Since, we\u2019ve had Mexicans being called rapists, \u201cgood people on both sides\u201d at Charlottesville and Kung Flu. And there\u2019s plenty more.",

Not only did their apology of something that never transpired give the critics gasoline and paint our university as racist, it somehow admits that the university is responsible for the actions of any student or fan. Even if this transpired, why should the university apologize, assuming they investigated and took action? The university did not use a racial slur, our student body did not use a racial slur. If one did, then BYU could say \u201cunfortunately this incident transpired and we have taken actions against the perpetrator. Their views do not represent our university or it\u2019s students.\u201d",

There are examples in the current \"woke\" movement of guilty until proven innocent, but I wouldn't say this is necessarily one of them.\n\nIf there is an accusation of hate speech, organizations should act quickly to try and ensure it stops. But, if after investigation, the organization can't find sufficient evidence to corroborate the accusation, the claim is dropped. It's roughly equivalent to a credible person saying there's a murderer in the park (or a bank robber, if we want to choose something non-violent). The police may detain the person in the interest of public safety, but an investigation occurs and a court may have to make a verdict based on evidence.\n\nBYU reinstated the individual's privileges and apologized in public statement. They then clarified they're not interested in scapegoating any individual (\"Our fight is against racism, not against any individual or any institution.\")\n\nWhere institutions go wrong is to declare a case closed after the initial accusation, and then double down on scapegoating in face of contrary evidence (or lack of evidence).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a precarious tight rope, but BYU did what they could to protect university guests from alleged hate speech, performed an investigation, and tried to make things right after they couldn't corroborate the allegations.",

I was content with them for several years and then I started getting weird problems like poorly developed B&amp;W or unacceptably dusty negs. I still go there a lot just because they can't be beat on price but I just started developing and scanning my own because of my frustrations with them.\n\nWhen I'm a little more wash in cash your can't beat FIND lab in Orem. I'm friends with the owner and they're truly one of the best labs in the country. Their scans are unmatched and they offer so many pricing tiers from basic color corrected scans all the way to an extremely personalized experience where they'll work with you to get the tones and vibe you like and offer feedback and advice on how you're shooting and how to improve. If you're new to shooting it's worth the extra couple of dollars per roll just for all the time you'll save in the learning process. I've been shooting for years and every once in a while I'll still spring for the highest tier just because there's so much to learn from that crew. You can mail in or drop off film in person there.",

I'm a bigger guy so I worry about them not having my size of stuff since they don't do reservations.\n\nAlternately has anyone rented at UVU? Same questions about them I guess\n\nEdit: love the downvotes on a genuine question lol",

Just go 15min before it opens and wait if you\u2019re worried. \n\nOverall, I\u2019ve had a good experience. If you rent on saturday, you keep until Monday because they\u2019re closed on Sunday (they don\u2019t charge for Sunday) so it\u2019s a 2:1 deal",

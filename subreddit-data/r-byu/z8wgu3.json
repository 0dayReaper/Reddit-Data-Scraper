    "postText": "Hi, I'm looking for software developers who have a particular interest in music and entrepreneurship to help me launch an app. I'm currently designing the UX, but have no experience in software engineering. This wouldn't be a paid opportunity for any of us, just trying to form a team of passionate entrepreneurs that could hopefully make an app go big together--then the money will start coming in :)  \n\n\nIf that sounds at all interesting to anyone, please message me!",

The promise of equity or whatever it is very rarely pays off. Good luck with it all!",

I\u2019d love if there was guaranteed money as well, but isn\u2019t that what entrepreneurship is about? I\u2019m banking on an idea knowing it could very well be a complete failure and a waste of money.",

The class splits into groups of 4 and each needs to come up with an idea for an app to build throughout the semester. We worked with an art student on a fun idea she had, and gave her a finished project this week. Maybe you could reach out to that class the first week of next semester and see if anyone would use your idea as their for-credit project",

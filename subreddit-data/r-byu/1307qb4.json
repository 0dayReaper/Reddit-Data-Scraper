But that does not mean I won\u2019t respect people who believe either one of those things. I have not touched the Sun, so I can understand that some people might believe that. Likewise, for most of my life I believed in Joseph Smith being next to Jesus, and believed he was a prophet because I was taught that growing up. There is nothing wrong with people who think that way. And I will not stop you from still thinking like that.\n\nJoseph Smith lied about the Kinderhook Plates, the Zelph skeleton, and the Pearl of Great Price. That is unarguable proven fact from church approved sources. With those presented and \u201ctranslated\u201d the same way the Book of Mormon was translated, it is very safe to assume he lied about that too. \n\nJesus Christ never lied. Jesus didn\u2019t start a religion to give people power over others or raise money. He started a religious movement to give people the power of salvation through humility, goodness, and love. \n\nIf you still want to believe in Joseph Smith, that is your right! I believed for years too, and I thought it was making me happy, and it made a lot of sense the way I was taught! It made my family encourage me. And it made me fit in to the circle I was in. \n\nI can\u2019t stop you from believing and practicing mormonism, and I do not feel obligated to do so. Just sharing my thoughts that would have saved my friends a lot of pain when they learned that the church was factually incorrect. \n\nIn addition the education is great when you don\u2019t consider the full cost.",

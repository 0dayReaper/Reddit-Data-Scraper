If I were you, I'd get in touch with the bishop of that YSA ward (or any of them within reach of a BART station) and find out if there's people looking for roommates. Tons of people in my ward worked in SF.\n\nI lived in a house with a graphic designer and a Berkeley PhD candidate who were both in the YSA ward.",

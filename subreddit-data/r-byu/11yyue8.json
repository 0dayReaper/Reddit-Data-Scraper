    "postText": "Today while walking towards the Marriott center I saw a lamp by the dumpster behind the Bean museum. I thought it looked cool and it seemed like they were throwing it away. After further investigation, I saw that it had a BYU Surplus sticker on it so I assume that it is going to be surplus to be sold. I would be interested in buying the lamp but I don't know much about how surplus sales work.\n\nHas anyone been to a BYU Surplus sale before? The website says they are held monthly but I can't find any further info. Does anyone know when the next one will be?\n\nWhat are they like or what can I expect? Are the items sold for good prices?\n\nAny advice is welcome :)",

            "comment": "So you can actually go in at any time and see what they have available everyday. This includes some computers, but mostly items that they have just a ton of, like keyboards, mice, cords, etc. So not everything, but some things you can just go in and buy at any time. If there's something in particular you are looking for, you can also always call during their hours and they will let you know if you could buy it any time they are open, or if it's only available at their monthly sale. \n\nPrice wise, they try to be as close to market value as possible. Sometimes it's hard to keep up to date, but they will fairly regularly change prices.\n\nSince it's surplus, expect everything to be pretty old. A lot of the newer laptops and desktops that get surplused go towards their free rentals to students and faculty, so if you are wanting to buy a computer, don't expect anything really new or really nice. \n\nThey also have an ebay store (linked in their website) where they sell a lot of items as well. And if you want to buy from eBay, I think they'd allow you to go in store and buy it there instead of through eBay, but I would call to confirm first. \n\nFor the monthly sale, they open up most of the warehouse for you to go in and check out what is available. Imagine the tech section of the DI, but on steroids. Information about the monthly sale is on their website, and you can also put your email in an email list, to get updates on upcoming sales (they will sometimes have surprise sales for items that need to be sold quickly, outside of the monthly sale cycle).\n\nAlso, if you see items around campus that say surplus, please don't take them. They are not being given away for free, they still need to be taken to Surplus itself. Please don't steal.",

If you want some used electronics and don't want to use ebay, then go to the UVU surplus sales. Better variety/quality (for more than just electronics) and better prices.

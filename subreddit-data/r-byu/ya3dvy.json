Those are each designed to be \"core\" classes, meaning you don't want to fill your schedule up with them, but during a normal semester I think you could take any two of them plus two easy classes and have a part-time job/internship and not have any problems. Switching the two easy classes with another hard class will be harder but still doable. What's also nice is that ACC 200 is hard but doesn't require a lot of time commitment, and IS 201 is easy but requires more time commitment, so they won't leave you drowning in either lack of time or feeling like you have no idea what's going on.",

I personally think it will be easier than how the course has been (they are taking out a lot of the more \"technical\" accounting topics), but keep that in mind since others' past experiences with the class may not indicate accurately what to expect.",

Every topic is pretty easy, and I mostly just had quizzes to do, but it adds up for the tests, and the test questions are also not easy.\n\nIt's been a while since IS 201, but there were a lot of projects. Mostly excel with some very light coding.",

It was a lot of work but if you\u2019re willing to learn the concepts and put a little time in, you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nThat being said, if you plan to be super social or party a lot, dont. It will take considerable time and effort to get an A which you\u2019ll need in all if you intend to apply to finance or accounting (which judging from the classes it looks like).\n\nEdit: for the love of all that is holy never do an OCI. They are a massive scam and way time consuming for adding literally zero value to your life or resume. Avoid at all costs.",

If so, GPA and pre-req GPA are probably the most crucial part of your application. Setting up your schedule for success will be crucial. If you had to combine these classes in one semester, I would take IS201 and ACC200 together. Is201 is significantly more difficult and time consuming than IS110, but manageable. ACC200\u2019s difficulty will completely depend on how well you grasp accounting subjects. BYU accounting curriculum is really good so it taught well. Now that being said for some it is easy and for other it is not. Fin201 cover a lot of material. The first part of the class will review accounting subjects. If you are learning concurrently it will be difficult. I would take Fin201 in the spring with Larson.",

I wonder how can I start the exam because when I click \"interval exam 1\", it has a page look like the picture below, but it says that there will be a proctor. If I click start, will the exam begins directly?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nyh7u6a691b1.png?width=2940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=54bf0ca117bc550c2be11bce52fc5764e0d3e59d",

The Benson Building has a room for TAs to help students with their chemistry work. Come hang out with us there! Just down the hill from the \u201cfishbowl\u201d.\n\nAlso the SLC teachers are notoriously very good so you\u2019ll have a good time no doubt. And if it\u2019s not too late, I\u2019d recommend switching to Prof. Gillespie if you\u2019re already going to the SLC. I took Chem 105 from him and he is the absolute best professor I\u2019ve ever had. Very fair, teaches the content in a way that makes sense, and he\u2019s the biggest nerd. He\u2019s a high school Rocket League team coach.",

That test was more or less what we studied, but with some questions that involved intuitive knowledge, such as one that required you to just 'know' that the human body is about 60-75% water.",

Having an exposure to chemistry concepts is vital and can make it a lot easier, but if you have taken it in high school you should be just fine. The SLC teachers are also a lot easier, I had a friend take it there and it was a breeze for her compared to us taking it on campus.",

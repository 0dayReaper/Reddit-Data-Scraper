It is my last class I have to take to graduate and would prefer not to take it with finance next semester\u2026 buttt I\u2019m living in NYC next summer starting May 30ish and spring semester goes to June 13th. \n\nAlso, would prefer not to take independent study from Kearl, I\u2019ve heard that\u2019s horrid",

If you go into BYU with that mindset, you will likely crash and burn somewhere along your 2nd semester, if not sooner. I don't care how many people call certain Professors easy, or how religion and SWELL classes are often considered blow off classes; BYU is a hard school.\n\nTake 12-14, and absolutely no more than that. You might come out of your first semester with a full or half tuition scholarship. You can even do all that with a thriving social life.",

That's in part why I wrote my comment. \n\nI don't know about them being harder than my major classes (or even other GEs) though. They had more busy work (readings, essays, weekly journals) for sure. I guess it depends on who you take though. Your experience is yours.",

I hope I didn't come across as ableist in any way and if I did, I'm truly sorry. \n\nI definitely have heard them called slack off classes. Judging by your post history, I'm guessing you're in civil engineering (my major too). Having been a TA most of my college career, I heard a lot of students call GEs and religion classes things like easy, fake, nonsense, and baby classes. I think it was just a way to look down on non-engineering majors, and totally misses the spirit of why we even take GEs.",

I just wanted to clarify for OP that religion classes are exceedingly far from blow-off classes 95% of the time since you didn't say that explicitly, but I also forget I have a unique perspective since I read at the speed of a fifth grader \ud83d\ude02\n\nHaha, I was actually in environmental science before I had to drop out for mental health (I'm guessing you got civil engineering from all the urban infrastructure subs I visit haha), so maybe that's where the difference comes in. Everyone in my major (and adjacent majors--conservation, geography, etc) was readily willing to complain that GEs and religion classes are unnecessarily hard.",

As a Freshmen, a 17.5 credit schedule is just innately going to be difficult, however I haven't taken any of those classes before so I can't say to what extent that will be true. If you're determined to do it then you'll just really need to be on top of time management and self-discipline in getting things done. There's also a chance you start to regret having a 7:30am class, it sucks having to wake up that early. Do you intend to work at all on top of this?",

That being said, it looks like this is going to be a lot and I wouldn't advise loading yourself up so much your first real semester of college. I have a part-time job am a senior and have never taken more than 15 credits. You know yourself best and you can always take the first week and drop some before the add-drop deadline but I would seriously consider how busy you want to be / how much time you want to have for social and hobbies. College is hard and it only gets harder as you get deeper into your major. Just keep that in mind! Best of luck to you with whatever you decide.",

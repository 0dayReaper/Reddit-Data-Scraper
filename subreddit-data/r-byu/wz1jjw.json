However, from the inside it's a group that feels like they're constantly told they can't exist. They're not seeking extra rights but rather equal rights. This event other events are to let students know that it's okay to be them.\n\nIf you're legit and not being sarcastic don't be afraid to post questions like this even though you may be down voted. If you don't ask questions you won't learn.",

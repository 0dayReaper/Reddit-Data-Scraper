Your likelihood of admittance is consistent regardless. \n\nFirst of all, I love hearing your determination! There are many different pathways to getting to BYU, you should check out the FlexGE program through BYU continuing education, it\u2019s fantastic. \n\nHere are some pointers I\u2019d give students who aren\u2019t admitted: make sure all of your essays are aligned with the BYU aims. You can find them at aims.byu.edu. Write around those aims and talk about experiences in your life where you have exemplified them. \n\nSecondly, be real in your essays and make sure they really highlight what unique contributions you\u2019ll be able to bring to campus. \n\nYou are not likely to get admitted if you keep applying without significantly changing something in your transcript, essays, or experiences. So make sure when you reapply that something has changed in a significant manner. This could mean serving a mission and reapplying after the mission, or attending another university and applying as a transfer student after you\u2019ve completed 24 credits. \n\nBest of luck. Feel free to DM me if you have any other questions.",

            "comment": "[Never give up! Never surrender!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ2hJezvd2I) I was denied and then did a year at a community college and the reapplied and was admitted. That way, I was able to significantly improve my transcript and thus my application as a whole. Honestly, that was probably a better route to take than being admitted as a freshman as I was able to know a few generals knocked out cheaply. (It didn't make getting rejected stink any less, but it made getting accepted the second time around feel better.) If you do that, be sure to check which classes from that college transfer before you take them. Also, take some of the cornerstone courses from Institute if you can. They don't count towards your total religion credits, however they do count towards your required religion classes.",

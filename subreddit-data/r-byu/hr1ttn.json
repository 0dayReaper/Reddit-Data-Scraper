They kept offering to reduce the fee, even though they never did the work. It took him months to get the charges taken off, and only after he worked with dispute resolution. \n\nThen I moved to Montana. I live in an apartment above my landlord (he owns the house and I rent the upstairs apartment). MAN! It\u2019s such a world of difference. I will never go back, if I can avoid it, to a management company. Such a scam. This guy is chill as can be, rent and utilities are paid on Venmo (no screwy processing fees or \u201cutility bill handling fees\u201d jacking up your monthly cost). When your landlord knows you (and you know your landlord personally) the relationship is way better and there is trust. And you actually get rewarded for being a good tenant rather than being treated like a criminal in all cases and disputes.\n\nI don\u2019t think there was anything in Provo that caused me so much stress as the garbage housing system.",

BYU approved units literally average like 2-3% vacancy rates, which is basically guaranteed money compared to the rest of the rental market. Access to this kind of market should REQUIRE a high property and management standard. What's the incentive (positive or negative) for rental companies &amp; landlords to offer higher quality units? The OCH certainly isn't breaking bad on anyone (any property managers or landlords that is) and their standard rental contract is all bark and no bite, as the COVID situation has illustrated.\n\nDon't even get me started on how BYU's policy is baked into Provo city code. Look up \"baching singles\" in their zoning code to read some real clown material. Basically prohibits greater than 3 unrelated singles from living in properties zoned as single-family/double-family unless also zoned as a special student housing property. Makes you wonder if political/financial incentives are causing BYU to maintain their policy, rather than an interest in making the BYU experience spiritually enlightening. \n\nIf the goal of the housing policy is to stop single BYU students from having sex or participating in other covenant breaking activities, I'm afraid it was doomed from the start. If you're gonna do it, you're gonna do it. If you aren't, you aren't. My roommate experience has been MUCH more conducive to learning and covenant keeping since moving OUT of contracted housing.

That means that landlords, in order to pay mortgage, are incentivized to raise rent, cut corners, and scam students. Students end up paying for the situation BYU creates.\n\nI actually don't think that there's an easy solution to this, because I respect BYU's desire to create a religious and moral environment, but I think a little bit more trust would go a long ways. If BYU would allow you to live wherever you want and still follow the honor code, it could eliminate many of the issues. The housing market for BYU would expand and become more competitive, so you wouldn't have to settle for less all the time. Personally, I would live in Orem. You get more for your buck there. \n\nIf tons of students started moving to Springville and Orem, BYU landlords would have to adjust their rent rates and policies in order to fill up. There properties would, unfortunately, lose a lot of money, so there would be a mountain of lawsuits against BYU, but I still feel like it would be better for the students. \n\nTL:DR - If BYU got rid of the required housing and just trusted students to keep the honor code, rent would go down and landlords wouldn't be scumbags.",

I suspect they wouldn't drop extremely drastically though because there is still quite a bit of value in being closer to campus, i.e. a lot of students don't have cars.

The landlord's problem is not being able to pay their mortgage, which means they get foreclosed on and lose the property, and if the value is low enough, possibly having to declare bankruptcy to cover their losses, and possibly losing their personal assets to pay it back. It's probably not an \"oh that sucks, guess I'll not go to the Bahamas this week,\" it's potentially a series of dominoes that leads to the complete loss of decades of work and a whole family's livelihood.

                                    "comment": "A valid point but as you said - that scenario occurs when they can't pay their mortgage. Loss in value isn't a cash flow event until you sell but as you mentioned, could be a collateralization issue. I am quite skeptical that a drop in property value that significant would occur, even if BYU completely did away with the OCH - you're talking about a drop at least in excess of their equity in the property, probably over 20%. Provo's property values aren't that inflated from a regional context (i.e. a townhouse in Orem/Vineyard runs north of 300K right now). Nor do I think opening the boundaries up would cause existing approved property owners revenues (and ability to meet their debt service requirements) to immediately dry up. Utah overall is in a housing demand crunch, no getting around that. I think the real crime is the fact that BYU policy exacerbates the issue by limiting the markets ability to self-regulate.\n\nFrankly, as previously stated - real estate is a business and comparatively risky one - especially if you are running a highly leveraged operation. I don't think BYU needs to be in the business of maintaining the solvency of private businesses via its housing policy. If landlords aren't operating their investment properties through liability limiting vehicles (like an LLC) to mitigate the risk that a foreclosure results in judgements against personal assets, they are playing a dangerous game. I don't like the idea of a rental business owner losing their livelihood as much as the next guy but they likely have a few more steps to fall than students do before they find themselves out on the streets.",

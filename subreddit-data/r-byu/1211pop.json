    "postText": "Hey guys, new student here, just got accepted to BYU for the 2023-2024 fall/winter semesters and I was wondering if anyone has any advice for me regarding the waitlist time for on-campus housing??\n\nI turned in my application right at the end of the deadline, so I was only able to put my name on the waitlist yesterday even though housing signups have been around for about a week. I'd really like to stay at heritage halls, but at this point, I'd be cool with anything. I put my name on the waitlist for literally any available spot for helaman or heritage. Any ideas of how long it'll take to be offered a spot?\n\nHope y'alls are doing well &lt;33",

The wait-list is in order of when you applied for admission vs when you got on the wait-list. He applied for admission shortly before the priority deadline.",

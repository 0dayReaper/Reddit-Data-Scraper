I will say that when the story first leaked I found it very hard to believe that people were shouting slurs at others in a public setting at BYU.  During my time at BYU I can say that I met a handful of people who were subtly racist (which is still bad), but none that would ever actually call someone by a slur.\n\nUnfortunately the media did what it does and blew what was likely a small, isolated, and perhaps misunderstood incident into a breaking story about systemic racism at BYU.",

(For example, if at a basketball game, a visiting student heard \u201cshoot Kevin\u201d instead of \u201cwhoosh Kevin\u201d or something, idk)\n\nI\u2019m no conspiracy theorist, and I\u2019m still undecided on what happened. But it\u2019s certainly frustrating why so many sources disagree with hers (not just he said-she said). My guess is BYU took the actions they did to be safe in anticipation of finding evidence which has not surfaced.",

The BYU ROC section is known for being particularly good (bad?) at heckling and perhaps something was shouted or said that was misunderstood on the court but not by those around in the stands.  There are a lot of questions surrounding this whole thing and the lack of tangible evidence makes it seem that we may never get answers.\n\nI think BYU did the right thing by trying to take action against even the possibility of racist slurs having occurred but there are so many people blowing what happened out of proportion.  I've even heard people calling for BYU to cancel sports and for opposing teams to protest playing them.",

Now, a few days later, no reports have risen from anyone in attendance at the game that any of this actually happened? \n\nDid the fan in question whisper the slurs? Did he do some secret sign language that only the godmother, player, and himself could understand? Or could it possibly be an overblown (possibly made-up) tweet by a political activist who wanted to score some social karma for her political campaign which is rife with anti-white racist sentiments? \n\nWe still don't know 100% but as more info comes out, it sure doesn't seem like it played out how the godmother stated it did.",

I'll just have to live with not knowing whether whether it was Jacob's mom referenced in your post.\n\nNext, it seems like some of the details in your post have changed.  There's not much disclosure, but my question question is around your post as it originally went out.  Based on your post, you spoke to one student who attended the match (Jacob Hanson), a student's mom (unnamed) who did not attend the match, and an unnamed employee in the BYU Athletic Department who wasn't at the match but who had received messages from another employee who'd heard more.  Why did you say that you were \"unable to find any source in the student section who could corroborate Richardson's claim\" after speaking to a single eyewitness?  Seems like a misleading statement based on how many people you talked to.\n\nI guess my next question was on why you guys thought you were the ones to break the story.  Details had already been requested by local news outlets, who'd gotten the police report the first business day after the event occurred and published their report with more details and more experienced journalists that afternoon.  However, as your report spread on Twitter Monday afternoon, the story that spread was that the slur never happened and BYU knew but pinned blame on a handicapped fan for PR reasons to make the story go away.  Do you think there was anything in your presentation of details or the audience who helped you promote it that led to that interpretation?\n\nThank you in advance.",

Their sources could be legitimate, but it's also pretty easy to say, \"Sources say that a bird pooped on Donald Trump's head yesterday.\" Without naming my sources, it's pretty much just my word.\n\nI'm not saying the authors are lying, but they don't give the impression of being an unbiased news source, either.

It seems Duke is claiming it is \"X\" student, and BYU campus police are saying essentially \"there's no proof that it's X\" but because Duke identified \"X\", the athletic department insisted BYU police to ban the person from future games. Where it seems like they are on the same page is that a racial slur was yelled at some point. To the credit of the \"it didn't happen\" crowd, there aren't any videos of it which seems unlikely considering how many videos happen during games for social media by fans.\n\nIMO, racial slur prob was yelled and I think they probably got the wrong person. Evidence is in favor of X, that they weren't the one that yelled it.",

If you want to claim awesomeness of BYU, you take the higher road. You give the benefit of doubt to a victims of racism and discrimination. Even if this turns out to be false, you may want to understand why national media, politicians in Utah and elsewhere were ready to opine on it in favor of the victim.",

Now it is BYU's obligation to ensure the report is taken seriously and any offenders are identified. So far, they haven't been able to identify the individual, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

No matter how some may paint BYU as becoming \"woke\" or \"progressive\" this school is still considered very conservative by the majority of the country and beyond being conservative, has had various times where the actions of the school, students, alumni, and fans have painted the organization in a light where it's easy to believe that this kind of thing could happen at BYU. Yes, that's looking from the outside. I wouldn't be surprised if many students would say the opposite based on their personal experience but those personal experiences are not what is making it out to the rest of the world.   \n\n\nNow you say that this is unfair and that BYU is being treated unfairly because their LDS, or conservative, Christian, or something. Yes it likely is unfair and unfortunately the only way to overcome this stigma will be to become a model example of what an LDS, Faith based, or conservative school could be. It means that perhaps we can't heckle the way others schools do at games. it means we have to be respectful fans. It means we have to hold ourselves to a higher standard even if we are already good. Because people are watching and all it takes is the a rumor of story like this and they'll easily believe that of course BYU is a school full of bigots. It is because the narrative has been set. Some of it by bad actors some of it by misunderstanding but all of it with a real consequence and so you can either rise above what you are being called or you let them continue to define the narrative.   \n\n\nFrom a faithful perspective we are told things won't be easy for the Saints and that we will always stand out as a peculiar people but it would be better to be peculiar for good things rather than for being a place where it's easy to believe this kind of thing can happen.   \n\n\nIf we're the Lord's School it means holding ourselves to a higher standard and making sure that our reputation is one deserving of that title.",

            "comment": "Most places around BYU are between 300 to 600 per month with 4-6 in the apartment. If you like it cheap find one of the 300, and if you are looking for even cheaper, find a 300 that doesn't lock you in during the summer months if you don't plan on staying then. A place I stayed in that is about 330 per month with around 15 extra for utilities with decent management was Academy Arms, and they didnt lock me in a contract for the summer. There are 4 people in total and you might need to pay extra if you want to upgrade the wifi for about 70/month but can be cut down if you share the bill between roomates. I found that the complex was fairly quiet and lacking in the social scene, so I left, but it's a great value. If you are looking for something different let me know and I might be able to suggest something.",

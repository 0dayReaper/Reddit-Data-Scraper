    "postText": "Just got my bike stolen either last night or the night before. Unfortunately wasn't registered w/ BYU as I already got a bike stolen 4 years ago and seemed unlikely I would be that unlucky 2 times in a row. \ud83d\ude43 Guess I learned my lesson. Super ticked since I JUST had it tuned up at Taylor's Bike Shop 1 week ago.  If anyone sees anything, let me know. \n- Orange Fuji mountain bike 29\"\n- very yellowed shifter lenses\n- has ulock attachment on frame near pedals (pretty scratched up down there if they removed)\n- had Centennial bike sticker on it\n\n\nFor those of you that did get bikes stolen, you ever find them again? Thinking about stalking community sale pages for the next couple of weeks. Which ones should I be on?",

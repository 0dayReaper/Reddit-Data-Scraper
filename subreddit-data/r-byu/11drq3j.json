    "postText": "We\u2019re looking at Alta and Glenwood as a group of 6. \n\nWe hate redstone, which owns Glenwood, but they seem like they are done remodeling so there isn\u2019t likely to be issues.\n\nAlta\u2019s apartments aren\u2019t as nice, and they don\u2019t come with a tv, and they only have 1 fridge. But they are cheaper and we like the management more.\n\nCan anyone who has lived in either of these places share their takes? Positive or negative, any advice is appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance",

I'm not sure if it's still the same people who own it, but it was my favorite place I stayed at BYU; the management was decent, the apartments were in good condition, and the wards were amazing. I'm sure things have changed with the off-campus housing rules changing, but at the time it was a very social but quieter and more mature crowd.",

If you want everyone in that apartment, and don\u2019t care about who owns the place, I\u2019d recommend glenwood; the people were nice and it\u2019s closer to campus. However, it isn\u2019t considered BYU off campus housing anymore, and if you\u2019re freshman that may be something to consider. Here\u2019s a list if you\u2019re interested in housing: https://och.byu.edu/all-facilities",

    "postText": "Hi,\nI am planning to transfer to BYU Idaho.  I am right now at uvu. The only reason I want to transfer to BYU Idaho is because is  cheaper than uvu for international student.\nAlso, I would like to know how is computer science program? What about accreditation? \n\nI have read many bad reviews because of honor code and byu Idaho are really strict with it. I am not a Mormon, I am Christian, and I don\u2019t want to get force to become a Mormon. I would like to know if it is worth it?\nAny advice would be great!",

Are there any current students that could send me the course material? Not your work, but the assignments. I took this class almost 10 years ago and failed hard.\n\nThanks!",

These classes are for teaching programming fundamentals and Python, respectively. They have changed it so that you start to learn C++ in CS 235 now. They do a C++ crash course for the first few modules and then get into data structures. \n\nIf you are looking to learn C++ basics and syntax, I would advise looking into other means.",

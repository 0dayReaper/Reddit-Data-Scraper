    "postText": "We're latino immigrants, first generation, my parents are LDS and raised us that way (even though I already left the church). He wants to study education and they think I'm influencing my brother not to go to BYU so I wanna show him support by asking yall what he should know about it, if there's any tips and the good sides of this university. I've heard from black people that it hasn't been kind to them so I'm very interested in listening to perspectives from other POC, as we're also mixed.",

            "comment": "Hey, I am a Mexican who is about to graduate so I can share some of my experience here. First of all, I am actually an international student and I have been here in the US and Utah for only about 5 years so my view and experience of BYU can be different from some that was raised here. \n\nIn my time, I honestly have never experienced any of the microaggressions everyone seems to mention. Maybe I have been lucky but I have honestly just meet great and kind people here in general (from professors to roommates). I don't even think anyone has assumed my nationality for my skin color or the way I talk. People tend to just ask and never imply anything. I could also mean that I honestly do not go in life just thinking someone will be racist towards me and maybe that's why I have never noticed. \n\nEven when I do not actively participate in any of the Hispanic clubs, I have friends who attend there and they love it. BYU also has many other clubs related to anything that you will like independently of who you are. I am part of the Finance club because I am a Finance major and I jave always been welcome there. \n\nI would say the only thing that could be shocking sometimes is the culture here in general. Majority of population is white and it shows. That is, the idea of a party is going to be getting together to play board games and eat chips or watch movies that are not R-rated (kind of lame). Dating is also very weird here. A lot of people tend to be extremely superficial or shallow (regardless of gender) when it comes to dating. There is also a weird pressure to get married and people will get souch anxiety and even depression because they are not married just because of pressure from peers and family. \n\nIn terms of workload, BYU likes to push their students academically. So, your brother needs to be prepared to work hard in general. That doesn't his life will be homework, but he will spend a decent amount of time per week on their classes. The good side is that all the professors are on your side. I have never met a professor that wants their students go fail. They are always available (even weekends sometimes) to meet with you and help you understand the materials. And if they cannot meet with you, their TAs will and your brother will pass. \n\nAlso, depending on the major, BYU has a good network of employers that hire students for internship or full time jobs. For the oast few years, the accounting program has been ranked as the #1 or #2 of the nation. In addition, cost is great relatively to other schools and as long as you have good grades, you can get scholarships.",

Of course you experience micro-aggressions on a daily basis, and people will try to make your nationality your whole personality. For me, the professors, opportunities, friends, and classes make up for the negative parts.",

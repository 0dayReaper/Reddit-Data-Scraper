    "postText": "Hey guys,  \n\n\nI'm considering grad school and this place is definitely on my list, and I tried to find the avg undergrad gpa's for admissions of the mechanical engineering grad program here (yes I did Graduate Catalog and I didn't see it there and yes I know that the minimum to get in is 3.0 and I know the avg is higher but if I could get a range or exact number that would be very helpful). Thanks!  \n\n\nP.S. this is just to give me an idea of what my gpa should be like during graduation so I can set it as a goal. Thanks!",

Also, keep in mind that GPA and GRE scores are secondary to undergraduate research. I don't know if your current university does any undergraduate research, but if so, talk to some of your professors to see if there are any undergrad openings in their lab.\n\nFinally--and this applies to all PhD. programs--it's the faculty, not the university itself, that admits you into the program. Look up some BYU professors that are doing research you think you'd be interested in and reach out to them. They might let you know if they have an opening for a PhD. student and what they might expect from you as a potential applicant. It also won't hurt to contact Eric Homer, the professor that oversees the graduate program, as I believe all applications have to go through him.",

            "comment": "For civil engineering the minimum gpa for a master's is 3.0 while a PhD is a 3.5. Most PhD students I've met are around the 3.5 range with some being below. I have heard that even if you have a gpa below a 3.5 if a professor wants to work with you have a much better chance of getting in. The same applies with GRE scores, they don't really matter if you have a decent gpa and a professor who wants to work with you.",

I couldn't find admission numbers for my program anywhere or anyone discussing it online.\n\nMy suggestion is to just do the very best you're able to with a decent work/life balance. Focus on doing well in classes related to your desired area of study as well as undergrad research opportunities.",

So its all about what you bring to the table in terms of your skills that will help with the research projects or the if the department needs TAs for their under grad classes. It is like applying for a job. :) \n\nKeep in mind BYU is primarily an undergrad university with a smaller graduate degree focus, so it can get competitive just because of less spots.",

I also went to a different university for my undergrad and had never done any reseach prior to what I'm doing for my thesis. I have found that it is often times more who you know than what you know when applying for graduate programs. Get good grades but then go and talk to a professor you want to work with and see if they are needing graduate students. \n\nAlso know that BYU offers a masters program and a PHd program, I'm just doing the masters and for PHd's it might be different.",

            "comment": "I think the best GPA you can get plus test scores plus research plus a fit with faculty interests. It is also important to know how many spots there actually are. I know in some BYU programs (different department they only let in 6 MS and 1 Ph.D. per year)  As another person responded I cannot stress enough your interests aligning with given faculty research. I would be shooting in 3.7-3.9+ range just speaking across the board (I know engineering is extra tough)",

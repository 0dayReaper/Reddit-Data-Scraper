    "postText": "Hi I have a couple of younger sisters going to be up at BYU soon (I\u2019m and older brother). We want to see if we can get an apartment or housing unit together. We\u2019re close and want to make it easy for us to hang out, help each other out with errands and such, save some money on housing costs, skip the pains of landing a bad roomie, and share the car. Does anyone know where to begin looking for housing that would work for us? I\u2019ve tried asking some friends, BYU housing, and consulted the housing catalog with no solid leads. Any helpful tips would be much appreciated :)",

You\u2019ll likely need to look at apts in Springville or Orem and assuming you want at least 2 rooms you\u2019ll be looking at an average of $950 unfurnished before utilities. Expect to pay more for a furnished apartment. \n\nBetween 3 people that\u2019s not to bad but you\u2019re a little behind the curve if you are looking for fall housing. \n\nSo it will be possible but you\u2019ll need to be creative. \n\nYou\u2019re also going to have to slog through all of the postings on ksl.com or craigslist and separate out the one-bedrooms contracts for sale or rent which is time consuming",

Because you would only have to live on campus for your first year of school. Even with that rule you have file a petition to live off campus. That may or may not be approved. It has all changed so i dont know how chill they are on that. \n\n There are 2 main ways of finding married housing in Provo. \n\n1. On Facebook either in the marketplace or married housing FB groups ( you may be able to join. When you ask to join usually the ask you a question to prove you are not a scamer). Housing goes really fast though. So look a few times a day. When you find one that you are interested in you can message the person who posted it. When you do the Facebook way you need to make sure the person who is selling the contract is legit. So usually I look at their profile before messaging and I make sure they look like a real person. When you message I usually ask for an application. \n\n2. Walk into (or call) a married housing complex that you find on Google maps and ask if you they would allow a group of sibling to live together. Most housing complexes don't have a website. Except this one: https://linx.appfolio.com/listings/listings\n\nMost of Provo uses the Facebook way. It is a little hectic but as long as you fill out the application the day you get it (I would make a folder with all of the information you need from your siblings and yourself after filling out the first one) and look every day you will find something eventually. \n\nAlso there are some important questions to ask if they contact you:\n1. What utilities will you pay for?\n2. How much are the utilities?\n3. Is the internet hook up to Google fiber or a different internet service (Google fiber has a free plan. Most places don't think of internet when you ask them about utilities)\n4. What is the parking situation?\n5. Will they charge extra for 3 people living in the apartment instead of the normal 2 (and maybe a baby)\n\nFacebook is also the way to finding cheap furniture and DI. I think the hardest and most expensive furniture item to find will be beds. But everything else you should be able to find for relatively cheap\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

            "comment": "I work at Jamba juice. (Not the one on campus.)\n\n\nThe best seller is Caribbean Passion: mango juice, orange sherbet, strawberries, and peach.\n\nThe fan favorite among the workers is Strawberry Surfrider: lemonade, lime sherbet, strawberries, and peaches.\n\nElectric blue lemonade served over a scoop of cocowhip (cool whip, but made with coconut) is heaven in a cup.\n\nOrange dream machine is super popular with the older crowd: soy milk, orange juice, vanilla ice cream, and orange sherbet. \n\nPink star is on the old/secret menu and it's fantastic: soy milk, raspberry sherbet, vanilla ice cream, strawberries. \n\n\nMy favorites are off menu, on these cool recipe cards we have behind the register. \n\nStrawberry shortcake: pineapple juice, soy milk, raspberry sherbet, vanilla ice cream, strawberries\n\nPurple dino: I forget the ingredients, but it slaps\n\nShark attack: pomegranate juice, lemonade, vanilla ice cream, raspberry sherbet, strawberries \n\n\n\n\nMy least favorite? \n\nWhite gummi, it's a combination of every ice cream we have, plus peach juice and mangos. The sister smoothies blue and red gummi are actually okay though. They just replace the peach juice with more flavorful juices.\n\nAcai super antioxidant, but with a scoop of peanut butter added. We have two or three regulars that do this and it tastes like a really terrible peanut butter and jelly.\n\n\nSome tips:\n\nThe whey protein tends to puff up your smoothie, often making it almost a size bigger. \n\nThe soy protein is grainy. If you can handle dairy, do the whey protein.\n\nThe caffeine boosts are bitter, and give me the jitters. You probably handle caffeine better than I do, but be aware.\n\nKale takes forever to blend. If you're getting a green smoothie, have patience. There's a reason you don't do kale in your little blender at home and it's because it just won't blend. \n\nBowls also take forever to blend. They're super thick so if you don't want them chunky, wait it out. It's worth the wait. \n\nJamba isn't a low calorie food. Everything off the plant based menu has sherbet in it. It tastes great, but it's not low calorie. Even our fresh squeezed juices need an orange for every 2oz of juice, meaning your 16 oz cup of fresh squeezed orange juice took 8 oranges. You try eating eight oranges in one sitting and see how you feel. \n\nFor my vegan friends out there: just order something from the plant based menu. Don't try to make a chocolate peanut butter milkshake vegan. Our chocolate powder has milk. Our ice cream has milk. Our milk is milk. Our honey is made of honey. I mean, I guess we have several vegan replacements, but it's hard to catch everything.",

I bet it would be quite useful if you lived in an area where a degree from an accredited American university, along with a training certificate in bookkeeping or database management etc. made you a competitive job candidate. \n\nI'm not sure why they don't just call it General Studies. As a US-based hiring manager, a degree in \"Professionalism\" throws red flags for me.",

I would suggest doing a bit more work to figure out what  degree would be a better fit. Holler with questions.",

                    "comment": "Yeah I was worried about that. See the problem is, I just turned 32 and now have a genetic disability. It's complicated, but basically my cells can't process the oxygen or nutrients my body puts in. To put that in perspective, I used to do construction. If I were to lift a bag of sand now, it would put me on my back for about an hour. Flights could kill me, I can't drive, and travel is risky, so remote work is the only reasonable option.\n\nIt's rare enough that the government doesn't recognize it as a disability, and SSI, and unemployment haven't been able to help me either.\n\nSo now I'm faced with a decision. Most remote work is looking for a Bachellors in a specific field. However, the problem is, all my fallbacks were labor related. I'm trying to find a Bachellors that can get me multiple fallbacks/career so that maybe (if I even have a future) that I might be able to work a good job from home. Now I am looking for more computer based work, but online job hunting is risky, and coming up scarce.\n\nNot sure what to do from here. Would General Studies be better? What would you recommend for someone in my position.",

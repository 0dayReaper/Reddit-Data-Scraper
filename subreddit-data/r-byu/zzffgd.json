She had a private room which helped, parking was extra but she never had an issue with finding a spot. I found visiting parking to be really a nightmare and ended up just longboarding or taking the long walk over most times to avoid it. One bathroom was hard, and the kitchen was a little small, but bedroom and living area was great. She doesn't remember how much utilities ended up being",

She ran into a lot of issues with them as managers when she was selling her contract as we got married- but I feel like you won't hear many good things about Provo student housing management ever so it may be a wash",

            "comment": "I live there now! There\u2019s usually no problem with parking\u2014you just need to make sure you get a parking pass early on because they only give out as many as parking spots available! Utilities during the winter are usually around 45. \nThey\u2019re definitely older apartments, but the kitchen/living room area is pretty spacious, especially compared to other apartments in a similar price range (or even compared to really expensive places I\u2019ve been in). The bathroom counter area is plenty of space, but the toilet/shower room is tiny, but it does the job lol\nOne thing that\u2019s great is you will either have a private room (slightly more rent) or share a room, for a total of only three girls per apartment!\nCampus, CupBop, South End Market, and Brooker\u2019s are all within easy walking distance (within two blocks). \nThe walls are thin, and the Village is rowdy, but I really enjoy living there.\nHope this helps a bit!",

There are quizzes due before every class period, but you get unlimited tries. There are 4 ish \u201cwriting assignments,\u201d but they\u2019re just reflections on economic principles and book readings. \n\nSo I\u2019d highly recommend Platt\u2019s class. Can\u2019t say much about the other professors, but I have heard that Kearl\u2019s class is absolutely horrible with the exams (like multiple choice questions with a-j). So that\u2019s speculation, but all the people I\u2019ve talked to that have taken his class said the tests were horrible, but they really liked the content.\n\nSo overall, I\u2019d take Platt\u2019s class just since I had a great experience in it, but you\u2019re welcome to choose whichever class you think would be best.",

So if you want to be taught by a world-class econometrician, take it from him.\n\nHowever, since you're asking for the easiest to manage, I can't say. I took Pope as a freshman (in 2015), and it wasn't that bad. I don't know how the class has changed since then, but I think all the ECON 110 sections are comparable.",

The economics department has only one true 'econometrician' (Brigham Frandsen, who is very well known in the field). Mostly because of that one paper, Pope would be considered an environmental economist.\n\nNot saying Pope isn't incredibly smart and deserving of the praise, but just wanted to add some context. I've only heard good things about his classes, and I took a class from his son which I really liked as well. Fun fact, Pope has like 6 or 7 sons, and all of them got either a PhD in Econ or an MBA, if I remember correctly.",

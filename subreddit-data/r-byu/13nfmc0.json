    "postText": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m currently doing the paper clip challenge for a business class. Basically I trade up bigger and better starting with a paper clip. Right now I have 2 things I\u2019m looking to continue trading: \n\n1. A 25 inch LG smart TV w/ wall mount. \n\n2. A pair of Yeezy 350 v2 sneakers. Size 14, blue tint. \n\nSend me a message if you are interested in either. I can come to you! \n\nThanks, have a great night!",

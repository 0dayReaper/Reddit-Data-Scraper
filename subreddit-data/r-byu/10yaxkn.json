Any truth to this? Is it possible that the decision emails could be coming out at any time now really?",

The announced date is always the latest they\u2019ll release them. \n\nIf you\u2019ve applied, don\u2019t stress too much. The acceptance rates have been steadily rising for the last three or four admissions cycles. You\u2019ll end up exactly where you need to be.",

Likely that percentage number adds to the feeling of safety that BYUI YSA Wards feel about publishing events online. It also might also be affected by there being less to do in Rexburg than in Provo/Orem.",

I think part of it is also that one place decided one way and one place decided another and neither saw a reason to change because it worked well enough. Those are just two things I think contributed to things being the way they are. I'm sure there are lots of little things that contributed to things turning out this way. I wish I knew all the reasons, though. That would be cool.",

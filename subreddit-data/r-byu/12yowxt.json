    "postText": "So..\n\nI'm graduating Thursday (hopefully), and have all of my major and general requirements done. I only had one thing left to do this semester for my major, and then took 2 fun classes, well, for fun. \n\nAnyway, one of them, which I have greatly enjoyed, has kind of escaped my efforts as far as doing any of the actual work. I enjoyed the lectures, but I've been so focused on post-grad plans that I haven't done many of the recent assignments. Now I'm thinking I'll bag the whole final paper, which would probably result in a fail.\n\nIf I do fail this class, which isn't even related to my major, I'll still be able to graduate and everything right? I know it'll tank my GPA which sucks if I want to go back for more school, but I'm kind of over it lol. \n\nThanks!",

That will give you a W in your transcript that is way better than a failing grade or a terrible grade, so it will not harm your GPA. They will also answer any questions that you might have about graduation requirements. \n\nThere\u2019s a really cool dude in that office, his name is Dan Wilson and he does petitions and graduation. \n\nMy roommate happened to be in the same situation as you and they took care of him but try to go ASAP otherwise grades will be posted and then the process gets harder.",

I thought I was going to fail a class that wasn\u2019t required for my generals or major- I researched a bit and iirc, you should be able to graduate without an issue. I didn\u2019t end up failing that class tho, so I can\u2019t tell you with 100% certainty",

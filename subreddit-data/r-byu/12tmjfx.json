I have most of my general education requirements done through dual enrollment and AP classes, so I'm taking a few classes that count towards my major (chemical engineering) this semester.\n\nIs there anything I should know going into the major?  Any opportunities/classes that you wish you'd known about?\n\nWhat is the average high school GPA (best guess) of the students in the program? I know it's one of the hardest bachelor's degrees to earn, so I'm trying to figure out ahead of time if it is manageable for me.",

            "comment": "I'm a CyberSec major, but two of my roommates are Chem E. majors and this is what I know. \n\nChem E. is one of the hardest majors at BYU. It is the longest major by number of required credits at 102.5. This credit count is also kind of a lie, as many of the Chem E. classes are 3 lecture hours AND 3 lab hours, but are only worth 3 credits. Its also a ton of Math, Physics, and Chemistry. If you don't really love those subjects, you are gonna have a terrible time. \n\nYou likely wont graduate in 4 years. It's good that you have most of your generals out of the way, but you still will likely take longer than 4. I know tons of Chem E. majors, and haven't met a single one that is still on track for an 8 semester graduation. You might be able to take classes during the summer, but most Chem E. classes won't be offered anyway. \n\nDespite that, it is still a great program. It has a very good return on investment, and once you get the degree you basically have job security forever. The world will always need Chem E. It's also totally doable. Hundreds of students do it every year. If you are willing to put in the work and suffer for a while, it will open you up to some pretty great jobs.",

            "comment": "I started at BYU declared Chem E but ultimately found a better fit somewhere else. I'd love to share a few of my thoughts.\n\nAs mentioned by another commentor, Chem E is the longest major by credits and they're all very difficult classes. Don't be afraid to take 5 years to do the program, or whatever pace works for you. I know people that did it in 4 years, and I know people that did it in 6+ years. \n\nIf you already have some chemistry credit from AP classes, don't be afraid to take classes that you don't \"have\" to. I think my biggest regret is not taking the freshman chemistry classes because I got credit for them through AP. It would have been a great refresher and preparation for the more difficult classes that come next. Also, some easier/review classes freshman year will help your GPA have a good start.\n\nDon't feel like you have to only take classes that count towards your major! Even if you're done with generals, find at least one \"fun\" class per semester so not every single thing you're doing is heavy math and science. Again, having an easier/fun class helps your GPA. Student activity classes are a great place to start. My other favorite recommendation is Geology 100, \"dinosaurs\". Fun class with a couple really interesting field trips.",

I'll just give you my experience and what I've seen from my colleagues, but feel free to ask me specific questions and I'd love to answer them!\n\nIn all honesty, highschool GPA does not have much weight once you get in, but your work ethic and attitude does matter. I transferred to BYU from another college with 30 credits and was able to complete this degree in 4 years. It's doable to complete in 4 years, but you have to be willing to take 16-18 credits every semester, and maybe a couple spring/summer courses as well.\n\nWhat I found was the most impactful, was finding 2 or 3 other classmates and sticking with them throughout the years. Having a solid study group will get you through the grind, and make the years better.\n\nThe biggest advice I would say, is try to find out what you want to specialize in/future job as soon as you can. Talk to the professors, internet searches are okay but impersonal. The professors are super open and love to discuss what options you have. For example, you can go into nuclear engineering, machine learning/optimization, bioengineering, etc. \n\nIf there's any specific questions, I'd love to take the time to answer them, just let me know!",

You may have to volunteer your time at first, but you'll eventually get a paid position.  \n[https://chemicalengineering.byu.edu/research](https://chemicalengineering.byu.edu/research) lists the research being done by the department. It's not really up to date, but is a decent place to look for research areas that interest you. If anything catches your interest, reach out to the professor and ask if you can join their research group or talk to them to better understand their research projects.",

            "comment": "I was in straight Chem not Chem E, so I\u2019m not positive what differences there are between the majors, but I can tell you a little about my Chem experience and a little about the professional world from my dad\u2019s experience working in process chemistry (where a lot of Chemical engineers are involved in the work). \n\nThis may be really obvious, but it\u2019s worth pointing out that chemistry will go a lot deeper into the reasons why chemistry works the way it does, and chemical engineering will sacrifice some depth to add extra process components to your knowledge base. These are things like more focus on thermodynamics and heat transfer and fluid mechanics. All sorts of side knowledge parallel to the actual chemistry involved in a reaction. In a perfect world, you would have just as much chemistry knowledge as someone designing a reaction, so you end up getting pushed to try and go deep on chemistry as well as the other fields, which is why the Chem E major is so long and probably a contributing factor in difficulty. \n\nI washed out of the Chem program after getting a minor. I got halfway through physical chemistry and the rigorous courses were too much for me with some other personal issues I was working through. I wound up moving to a completely different major and graduating in that field. The courses are hard. I have no doubt that the course load for Chem E will be just as strenuous as it was for Chem. \n\nI\u2019m terms of opportunities, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the same for Chem E, but in chemistry the sooner you were able to join a lab and work under a professor, the better off you\u2019d be. In Chem it was one of the best opportunities you could gain. I would start checking with professors as soon as you can (even as a freshman) to see if there\u2019s a similar opportunity you can find in Chem E. \n\nI would also recommend checking with the Chem E academic advisor (you can schedule an appointment early on) and see what a 4 year and 5 year graduation plan looks like. They\u2019ll have all that available and it\u2019ll make your life much easier to know the plan ahead of time. I think you can probably even arrange a phone call or zoom meeting before you even get to BYU, but I would definitely go in during the first semester to start a plan. If 4 years takes 16 credits a semester, I would seriously urge you to consider taking a 5 year approach if it\u2019s financially viable. \n\nI think that\u2019s a good start, making a plan and then working a plan is an excellent approach, but I also hope you don\u2019t get discouraged if things don\u2019t work out according to plan right away. Be ready for something to go awry and try and stay positive when it does.",

If you can't figure it out, dabble in Electrical or Mechanical and see if they are better.\n\nI didn't like Chem E at BYU, and I wish I had done mechanical instead. Unfortunately, I didn't realize until my senior year that I really really didn't want to do petroleum or chemical processes (chemical reaction engineering) for a living. I'm also not a huge fan of most of the BYU Chem E faculty. But it is too late now.",

            "comment": "Hi! Fellow engineer here. I did Civil Engineering instead of chemical, but my advice is pretty general.\n\nYour very first semester, focus on getting that 4.0 if possible. Take the bare minimum you can to stay at full time. You will be eligible for a full tuition scholarship starting the following fall.\n\nHigh school is about doing the most with the hardest things. College is about doing well with the minimum possible. You will be grateful if you do this and may actually be able to get a social life that first year. Plus you'll get scholarships for Spring/summer and can work for a Professor then.\n\nOther things:\n-Space out your math courses\n-Realize you don't have to commit to an emphasis within ChemE immediately\n-Be kind to everyone at BYU. Engineers have a reputation for being stuck up, same for business people. It doesn't have to be that way, and honestly mostly isn't. But genuinely, treat even the meanest person how you wish people would treat you on a bad day",

            "comment": "I'm in electrical engineering, and my best advice is to accept that you aren't going to be graduating in 4 years right now. Besides one genius I know that's doing electrical engineering in 3 years, everyone I know in electrical, mechanical, and chemical is doing 5. It might be tempting to think you're that guy, and maybe you are, but odds are your GPA will thank you if you take less credits per semester to focus on actually learning from each class.\n\nAlso, having a less stressful course load gives you more time to get involved in research and clubs, both of which I highly recommend getting involved in ASAP. \n\nTo land a research assistant job, go into BYUs website and look for a professor that's doing research in something you're interested in and send them an email that expresses that interest. A lot of professors care a lot more about interest and passion than actual experience because you might need to do a few months of learning regardless of how far you are in school, so they tend to like hiring younger students to get more time out of them.\n\nThere's also a ton of engineering clubs at BYU that are great for networking and expanding your social circle. Ive met a lot of really cool chemical engineers and mechanical engineers through clubs and I also know a lot of people that have landed internships and research positions through their clubs.",

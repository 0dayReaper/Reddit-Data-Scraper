The invitation to replace \u201cthe church\u201d with \u201cJesus Christ\u201d anytime we have concerns or questions is a thought-stopping and theologically flawed approach. We know from history the church has been wrong so what\u2019s up with this teaching becoming so pervasive nowadays? \n\nAdditionally, stating that people aren\u2019t truly following Christ unless they\u2019re doing it through the Church is just so weird when we simultaneously acknowledge the validity of other denominational Christians, and many of my current friends continue to believe in and follow Christ independent of the church because of bad experiences they\u2019ve had. We need to honor that instead of judging it. \n\nWhy are we getting messages like this from the church so often? It\u2019s so exhausting and old. \n\n[https://youtu.be/Zm2EMhPAoSI](https://youtu.be/Zm2EMhPAoSI)",

I just want to say the church would be in a much better place today if more people weren't afraid to voice their opinions when they disagree with the brethren. \n\nThat's the only way meaningful change really happens, IMO. Look at stuff like the November 2015 policy against children of LGBTQ parents, and the previous policy that parents weren't allowed to be with their children during one-on-one bishop interviews. Change only happens when enough members speaks up, unfortunately.",

                    "comment": "Not only when enough members speak up, but also when the most vocal members are disciplined and/or excommunicated first. It\u2019s crazy to me how the worthiness interviews allowed parents to attend only after Sam Young vigorously advocated for the church to reconsider their approach to interviewing children about sex and chastity. They excommunicated him, and then the change came about a few weeks later. The Ordain Women Movement\u2014whether you agree with their conclusions and approach or not\u2014undoubtedly got the ball rolling on leadership and members reconsidering the position of women in the church and their status. Many of the September 6 excommunications at BYU were of scholars and academics writing about topics that the church now teaches more openly, such as Mother in Heaven, LGBTQ+ treatment of members, and Book of Mormon translation stories. But in their time, it was radical and too challenging to church authority. \n\nI wrote a letter to a bishop once outlining some concerns I had about our ward and talks given in sacrament meeting, and he called me a few hours later to chat. My mind immediately went to \u201cdisciplinary council\u201d\u2014the fact that I was so scared to challenge a leader, and assumed I\u2019d be punished for doing such, made me so angry. Luckily, my bishop was kind and took time to listen to and resolve my concerns, but I still remember how I felt when I first picked up the phone.\n\nIt is so wrong that leaders have created a culture of fear to maintain a sense of superiority over members. I pray it gets better, because the church will not survive long in a culture of fear.",

I would like to add that the title of the devotional is, \"Why a Church?\" This is a fantastic, interesting premise for a devotional. I was very excited for this speech when I attended on Tuesday.\n\nBut the answer the speaker gives is not satisfactory. It starts well, explaining that being a regular part of a church can help us connect with God more than worshipping without one. But after that, it seems he forgets what kind of person is asking this question. Instead of helping people to realize what a church can do for them, he castigates them for even thinking that the church might have flaws. That's not helpful.\n\nI find great fault with this speaker's proposal that we replace \"the church\" with \"Jesus Christ\" in our concerns about our church. It's not that I question whether church leaders are invested in divine authority. It's just that I know that the church, the institution itself, run by men, has done bad things with terrible justifications that [it no longer accepts](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng). By asking us to replace \"the church\" with \"Jesus Christ\" in all our criticisms and concerns, **this speaker is asking us not to blame humanity for our sins, but to blame God**. This idea, to my mind, verges on blasphemy, and I can only accept it from this speaker because I do not think he understands what he is saying.\n\nI hope someday soon church leaders will begin to understand why people have these kinds of concerns, but until then I guess we just have to keep dealing with ill-thought ideas like this.",

Anything but blind loyalty to the Church leadership is viewed as apostasy. To me it looks like a bunch of fallible, mortal men trying to hide behind a facade of divine power. People who want a strong central leadership may be drawn to that, but it's turned away people like me who want transparency from leadership. \n\nAny concerns about Church leadership is eventually met with \"if you had enough faith then these things wouldn't matter.\" Not only is that dismissive, but it's manipulative and abusive. Cult-like. \n\nMy individual concerns have no way of affecting Church leadership anyway, it's not like they have any direct accountability to the membership and the membership has no way of enforcing accountability. So my doubts and concerns don't even really matter in the grand scheme of things. But I'm not allowed to voice my individual concerns according to Church culture, because my voice may lead other people away. So instead of addressing concerns, Church culture just instead seeks to quash all concerns at the source and prevent any kind of collective idea or group that goes against leadership. It's an authoritarian hellhole. Conform or you're going to hell.\n\nAnd I just know a bunch of \"defenders of the faith\" are going to respond to this post and point how I'm wrong and the Church is great and the faithful are chosen to defend against evil, etc. Those are the type of people who love the authoritarianism in the Church. They have zero empathy for people with doubts and just want to feel morally superior. The modern day equivalent of Pharisees with performative morality.",

There's a difference between rejecting His church, and being aware of flaws and mistakes. You can have criticisms of various things of or related to the church but still sustain the Prophet and Apostles, keep your covenants, and follow and live the Gospel of Jesus Christ as it has been revealed. Meanwhile rejecting priesthood authority, removing your records, preaching against established doctrine, and making light of/refusing to live your covenants because you're unhappy about something is what constitutes outright rejection.\n\n&gt;stating that people aren\u2019t truly following Christ unless they\u2019re doing it through the Church is just so weird when we simultaneously acknowledge the validity of other denominational Christians\n\nDo you believe in the Restored Church of Jesus Christ and priesthood authority or not? It's that simple. The \"validity\" of other Christian churches that we talk about is not a full recognition of the \"validity\" of their doctrine and practices, it's a validity of their right to exercise freedom of religion and point people to Christ as found in the Bible. They do the best they can with the light and knowledge they have, but we know there is more that has been revealed and that the true Church of Christ has ongoing revelation and priesthood authority.

In my view, it\u2019s not that straightforward because we call ourselves Christ\u2019s church yet we also acknowledge we aren\u2019t the only church through which Christ works to bring people unto Himself. I definitely sustain the leadership of the church, and generally speaking their counsel is helpful and productive for my discipleship and faith in Christ. \n\nThe reality is, I know many people outside of the church who I would not say are \u201crejecting Christ\u201d, but they aren\u2019t members and they probably won\u2019t ever humor joining the Church for a multitude of reasons, many of which are valid and real. Some of them actually seem to be better disciples than some of the orthodox members I sit by at church every Sunday; I would sooner take notes from their discipleship than from the discipleship of fellow Latter-day Saints. This is where the problems comes into play for me, because I do not think membership in the church = accepting Christ and living by His example. Sure, if you\u2019re not a member you don\u2019t participate in temple ordinances or hold priesthood offices, but I don\u2019t think that lack of participation immediately qualifies you as a rejector of Christ. I think stating so is actually quite invalidating and monopolistic. \n\nAlso, acting as if we can just compare Christ and the Church as if they are the same is just not realistic. Christ is a perfect individual, our church is a generally good but flawed institution. Our church is incomplete and suffers from a variety of growing pains that I believe many of us care about and are working to improve. Thus, it is not accurate to say our church is wholly reflective of the mission of Christ because we aren\u2019t *there* yet. And we won\u2019t be there for a while, I imagine.",

As such the Church culture is highly based on US culture: anti-federal sentiment, Puritan morality, and a streak of American exceptionalism. Conservative american politics have really leaned into the American exceptionalism in the past few years, and I feel that is what's poisoning the Church culture. There are people who dogmatically believe that the US is the best country ever, refuse to consider any flaws, and argue against any improvement. Those same people have been applying that dogmatic attitude to the Church.",

We have never, and will never, teach that other churches hold the keys to salvation. People learning of and having faith in the Savior, and living a Christlike life, is different from truly coming unto Him. We understand that the only way back to the Father is through Jesus Christ, who established the Gospel of Jesus Christ as the way back, comprising faith, repentance, baptism by priesthood authority, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Baptism by authority and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost are only available in the Church of Christ. Nowhere else. \n\nWe believe that the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ (the only way back to the Father) fully exists in only one denomination, so what does that say if you reject the church that espouses it? Again we can argue semantics, but on a level of definition, rejecting the church that has the fullness of the gospel, is in fact, rejecting the path back to the Father, and by extension, is rejecting what Jesus offers. Does that mean you hate Jesus? Does that mean you don't follow some of His teachings? Does that make you a bad person? No, not at all. People can believe in Jesus and live extremely Christ-*like* lives without being  a member of the church. However, refusing the Church of Christ is a rejection of the fullness of Christ. Most people who \"reject\" it, probably don't fully understand that, or understand what they're doing. Nevertheless, it is a rejection. We still love them and support the good they do in the world and their lives, and we know that after this life all will have an opportunity to learn and fully accept Christ if they want to, that's the beauty of the Savior's plan of salvation.\n\n&gt;acting as if we can just compare Christ and the Church as if they are the same is just not realistic\n\nI agree, but I don't interpret the message here as saying that. The church is made up of imperfect people, like you've said. It has flaws and mistakes in its history. But Christ is at the head, He administers it, He reveals to it, He is the center of it, He leads it, and He established it. \n\nI think we have similar feelings on a number of these topics, but just are differing on semantics. Things aren't so black and white as they seem.",

I do think church attendance is important for a variety of reasons, one of the largest being that activity in a community full of people who are different from you is a healthy kind of challenging, especially for faith. We need each other. President Oaks\u2019 talk on this topic a couple of conferences back touched on that quite nicely.\n\nLatter-day Saints are less than 1% of the global population though. That\u2019s a staggering statistic to consider. That\u2019s why I\u2019m inclined to cringe a bit when we act like we have to convert to the church and be members in mortality in order to be saved and exalted. I think there are other pathways to eventually getting there, not necessarily outside of those ordinances or covenants, but certainly in a different time frame; and I wish we were more sensitive of that.",

We do learn in the Plan of Salvation that those who receive and then reject the gospel in this life, are in a different state than those who don't learn about the gospel in this life but accept it afterwards, and I think that key difference is why this whole thing is talked about so much. Turning away missionaries at your door the couple times in your life they show up is not the same as gaining a testimony of the restoration, making covenants, and then stepping away from them in mortality, only to re-accept the gospel later.\n\nIt would certainly be nice for more people to learn of and accept the gospel in this life, but it's not an achievable reality.\n\nAnd at the end of it all, we don't fully understand *everything* about how the afterlife and \"2nd chances\" work, and so I agree with you that it's insensitive at times to assume any person outside of the church has a lesser chance at salvation because of x, y or z in this life.",

            "comment": "While we acknowledge that there are good people who attempt to follow Christ who are not members of the Church, at the heart of our doctrine is that only through our Church, which we believe is the one true Church, is there the possibility to truly follow Christ and obtain all that  has  been promised to the children of God. So no matter how wonderful a person is outside of the Church, we ultimately believe that only the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has what is needed, covenants and ordinances performed by authority,  for them to obtain exaltation and to come closest to the Savior. Were it not so there would really be no need for the Church as any church would do. This exceptionalism is a core tenant of our faith and the reason we work so hard to both spread the gospel for missionary work and perform the work for the dead in temples. Yes, our faith condemns none of these believers in Christ to Hell and will ultimately find peace in a life better than this but we strictly have a belief that the only way to return to the presence of God and Christ is through the authority given to the Church. That being said ultimately it is between God and his child as to the state of their soul and their spiritual path. You are right we cannot judge and we must love them no matter the path they choose.   \n\n\nNow as to the question of the Church being wrong. At its heart the Church is its people and people are often wrong. If we look at the early church established by Jesus Christ but carried on by his disciples and Apostles, we see many times that there was contention and error among these early Christians but when they chose to follow the revelation and authority given to them from Christ they were able to correct those flaws and return to the path of righteousness. In the same way the Children of Israel too often errored and made choices that could be considered wrong but time and time again when they chose to follow the revelation and authority of God they were blessed. So to does the Church today draw closer and further from God but as long as it accepts correction and follows what guidance God gives, the Church can continue to be the Church of Christ. Leaders and individuals in the Church often make bad choices and many people are harmed by those choices. These choices can often become policy because as a Church lead by men we can stray from the path just as easy as those early Saints in the New Testament or the Children of Israel. Sometimes we have to wait for a generation of the Church to die out for it to change for the better. So yes people are wrong and people are the Church, so the Church can be wrong. However, though we can be wrong, referring to paragraph above we are taught we are the only faith that has the authority to act in the name of Jesus Christ and to administer the ordinances and covenants required to gain exaltation.   \n\n\nSo the tools of perfection are put into the hands of imperfect mortals who will be judged by that they have done with those tools.   \n\n\nNow the real condemnation comes from how we act with that authority and how we act in the name of Christ and to agree with you many leaders and members of the Church have been terrible about that and many people have suffered because of their choices. They quite rightly deserve to be apologized to and very much have a right to walk their own path. I do not believe God will condemn them for the actions of others. However, for those of us in the Church that see such negative things happening it is our duty to try and correct things using the tools which we have been guided to use, to paraphrased D&amp;C 121 41-46 persuasion, longsuffering, gentleness and meekness, love, kindness, pure knowledge,  and without guile....   \n\n\nWhy is this taught again and again? Both as a warning to those who are members of the church and it's leaders that we are the representatives of Christ and our actions bear a weight of consequence not only in our lives today but in the eternities and to remind of of where our Church comes from and it's unique authority.  \n\n\nThat perhaps is not the answer to the question you wanted but hopefully it answers the concepts you brought up. Thanks for sharing your thoughts it got me to pay more attention to the talk and think about these things.",

I do believe President Nelson is a prophet; I do not believe he is going to get correct every invitation, piece of counsel, or teaching, and I\u2019m comfortable disagreeing with him and receiving my own personal revelation on matters, even if that revelation contradicts his teaching.

If you were living in the 70s when black members could not receive the priesthood or ordinances, would you willingly adopt the racist mentality of many leaders during that time period without second thought? Leaders of that time have been on record speaking of our black brothers and sisters in abhorrent ways\u2014worse yet, they passed those teachings off as doctrine and eternal truths, and their teachings aged like milk.

                    "comment": "I think \"true church\" needs to be better defined. The Church of Jesus Christ is the only Church authorized to perform saving ordinances, but it is not the only \"true church\" in that it is the only church that teaches truth. It is unfathomable to conclude that God would expect everyone to belong to the Church in this life and it is equally unfathomable to conclude that God would abandon a vast majority of his children to live in darkness. I believe that God encourages other religions and churches to flourish insofar as they teach kindness, charity, love, and other Christlike attributes. \n\nTo your point about Church leaders, it is essential that we practice conscious obedience, not blind obedience. It is acceptable to question policy and teaching, because they *do* change. The only things that don't change are the doctrines that God is our Father, Jesus is the Christ, and through faith in Christ and repentance we receive a fullness of salvation. *Everything else is appendage to that.* Faith is not dogma and obedience should be informed and skeptical.",

            "comment": "I personally loved this devotional. But thanks for sharing your thoughts and interpretations on this subject. It's nice to hear other people's perspectives on topics like these.\n\nPersonally, when they said replacing the world \"church\" with Jesus Christ I interpreted it in the doctrine, ordinances and scriptures we base our church on, not the actual church itself. Men are fallible. We make mistakes all the time, every day. However, we are all God has to work with, and he can't control our will.\n\nIt's also important to distinguish between doctrine and opinions of the church. If it's in the scriptures? Doctrine. End of story. Anything but the scriptures? That depends if they use the scriptures to emphasize a point, or not. If not, it's more of an opinion.\n\n&gt;Additionally, stating that people aren\u2019t truly following Christ unless they\u2019re doing it through the Church is just so weird when we simultaneously acknowledge the validity of other denominational Christians, and many of my current friends continue to believe in and follow Christ independent of the church...\n\nYou can follow Christ in this way to a certain degree. Remember, everyone receives eternal life and wins against physical death. But not spiritual. In order for us to be truly saved, (be in the presence of both Jesus Christ AND Heavenly Father) is to follow the doctrine of Christ.\n\n&gt;*\"And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that* ***endureth to the end****, the same shall be saved. And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that* ***unless a man shall endure to the end****, in* ***following the example of the Son of the living God****, he cannot be saved. Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter. For the gate by which ye should enter is* ***repentance*** *and* ***baptism by water****; and then cometh a* ***remission of your sins*** *by fire and by the Holy Ghost. And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have* ***received the Holy Ghost****, which witnesses of the Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.\"* ***(2 Nephi 31:15-18)***\n\nBaptism is the first step to the Celestial kingdom only done by a worthy member holding the priesthood keys. The priesthood is in this church. That's why Elder Hamilton says to truly follow Christ is through the church. ***However, the only person in the world that decides that we go to the Celestial Kingdom or not, is Jesus Christ.*** Members of the church can be baptized, endowed, married &amp; sealed, that would allow them to go to the Celestial Kingdom, yet they can still go to other places if that is what the Lord determines.\n\n&gt;and many of my current friends continue to believe in and follow Christ independent of the church because of bad experiences they\u2019ve had. **We need to honor that instead of judging it.**\n\n**I like this point.** The only person capable of righteously judging others is Christ Himself. As a church, I think we need to stop judging others based on **experiences we haven't had** and **when we don't have the full story**. I also like the quote here:\n\n&gt;*\"Don't judge someone just because they sin differently than you.\"*\n\nAm I saying your friends who had bad experiences are sinning? No, but I like the quote and how it emphasizes that we are all sinners, we just sin differently than others and so its hypocritical to judge others because we aren't perfect either. I don't know your friends' stories, so why would I treat them differently from any other person I've met? I'll respect their decision and hopefully they'll respect mine.\n\nAlso, the way I interpreted him saying we need a church to follow Him was not judging or condemning anyone who doesn't go to church. I think he was just trying to emphasize the important of church and why it makes a difference.\n\nBut that was my interpretation of this devotional.",

I personally did this and it was one of the strongest spiritual experiences I have recived. Ever since then I have had a strong belief in him as a prophet. \n\nNow, with that said I think it is important to understand the role of the prophet, he is God\u2019s voice on earth. He may not be perfect, but we are promised in this scripture that the words of the prophet are the words of God, I believe God has the power to prevent president Nelson from saying anything contray to God\u2019s will, thus everything he says is along the lines of God\u2019s will. And as Elder Anderson said a few years ago, when the first presidency and the 12, united with the prophet at its head declare something to be truth, it is doctrine and the offical teachings of the church, and it is the same as if Christ himself said it. Many things that are forefront today are complex and confusing, and it can be easy to misjnterpret God\u2019s will and become confused by the noise of the world, but God\u2019s prophet is the one on earth we can look to for Christ\u2019s words. \n\nThis is what I understood about this devotional, is that this is the church of Jesus Christ, thus when we have problems with the teachings of the church we are in essance having problems with the teachings of Christ himself. \n\nI was given confirmation from God that president Nelson is his servant, and thus I will follow president Nelson\u2019s counsel, wither or not I agree with it, because I understand that I can often misunderstand and confuse things around me. But I can follow God\u2019s prophet, and he will point me and the entire church to Christ, as is his mission and his responsibility.",

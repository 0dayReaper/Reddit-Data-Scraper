            "comment": "If you have a car: Subzero liquid nitrogen ice cream in downtown Provo (across the street from the city center temple). It\u2019s a good experience, cheap, and a good conversation starter but doesn\u2019t have to take too long. They even have lactose free options for those who can\u2019t have normal ice cream. It\u2019s actually where I took my wife on our first date.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to spend any money at all: Bridalvale falls in Provo canyon on a Saturday afternoon. Great hike that is not strenuous at all.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have wheels: Varsity theater in the WILK. Literally $1 per ticket (unless they raised their prices) to see the movie of the week. Just purchase your ticket ahead of time at the student information desk.\n\nIf you can\u2019t even afford $2 for movie tickets and have no car: duck pond and path by the LSB on the south side of campus. Just don\u2019t give the ducks bread because campus grounds says it\u2019s unhealthy for them. If you want to fed them try pieces of apple or lettuce.\n\nIf you are feeling adventurous/already have a good friendship but this is the first time you are on a date together: go to DI and pick an outfit for each other. You don\u2019t even have to purchase it. Super fun and can generate laughs however don\u2019t try if you don\u2019t already know this person.\n\nIf you both like physical activity: hike the Y\n\nIf your into something new: sodalicious 3 blocks south of campus on like 600 east or so.\n\nThe old favorite/last resort: bowling in the bottom of the WILK. I think each student gets one free game per semester or something like that. You\u2019ll have to look it up",

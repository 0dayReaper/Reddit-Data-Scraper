I\u2019m not super excited about it but I can\u2019t think of anything else to do. Do you guys have any suggestions for general Ed or pre optometry courses?",

Look at the classes that fulfill those GE requirements that interest you and take those while you figure out your major and make sure to look up every professor on rate my professor before you take them",

            "comment": "I looked up BYU pre optometry and found some classes that they recommend.  Most of them can be generals so stick with ones that are both to get a better feel.  I worked at an optometrist office and I think that will be the best way for you to decide if that\u2019s what you want to do.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure what else you might want to do there is a Student Dev career explorations class.  (ST DEV 117). I\u2019d also just make ask upper class men what they are studying and why they like it.  Maybe ask them to show you a bit of what they have to do.  You don\u2019t have to know your major right away\n\nhttps://ppa.byu.edu/0000017d-c437-dfc1-a77f-c73f39e80001/optometry-information",

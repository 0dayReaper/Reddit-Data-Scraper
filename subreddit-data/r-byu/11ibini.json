Unfortunately I was just a setter since it was my first year, and the closers on my team were total losers and lost me a ton of accounts. Pretty much the only accounts they managed to close got screwed up by the installation company, and so even though I had maybe 60+ sets, 15+ of those were closes, I got paid for maybe 3 or 4. Still makes me mad whenever I think about it. The installers were so horrible aptive is suing them for $14 million now. Not that I\u2019ll ever see a penny of that",

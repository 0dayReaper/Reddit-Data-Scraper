    "postText": "Our son is halfway through his junior year and has been on full tuition scholarship at BYU. Through December 2022 he had a 3.95 GPA which takes into account most of the hard sciences and statistics, etc. his major requires. This afternoon he called and informed us he finished all of his finals already and will once again have all A\u2019s. \nWhat we don\u2019t understand is that a couple weeks ago he got a letter from the school informing him his scholarship is being cut in half. Huh?\nToday he called and informed us that his Statistics major and Premed roommate, who is about to start his senior year this week received notice that his full tuition scholarship is being reduced by half. He has a 3.98 GPA. \nWhat is going on at BYU? Is tithing down that much? Are they taking money from these kids to pay for additional expenses needed to compete in the Big 12? \nThis just seems wrong. BYU needs to get there act together. \nBYU likes to say it\u2019s a very affordable education. Actually it\u2019s the most expensive education in the world when you consider you\u2019ll be paying tithing for the remainder of your life. Has anyone else heard of this happening?",

            "comment": "Scholarships don\u2019t have a GPA cutoff/requirement. BYU just has X scholarships to give for a semester, so they go down the line of students in a particular school and give it to the X best GPA\u2019s. It can cause quite a bit of fluctuation year-to-year, if an unusual influx of high-gpa students join the major, or just improve their GPA\u2019s, a slight decrease or even just maintaining your gpa could lose your scholarship. It does often cause it to be quite competitive. I worked in Enrollment Services and remember seeing that the cutoff for Nursing students one year was crazy, it was like a 4.00 for full and a 3.94 for half or something. Just varies year to year.",

I have not heard of a single case where you were given an award letter and then it was pulled grades aren\u2019t out for this semester yet and there is no reason they would change award amount within a semester.

It\u2019s robbing Peter to pay Paul. \nIn the end these students will take out loans best case scenario or at worst, put off marriage because they don\u2019t see a path financially (statistically the church knows that students are putting off marriage due to school debt.)\nDoesn\u2019t seem like a win either way.",

They give more 1/2 than full tuition- byu would rather broadly help many than greatly help a few. Different scholarships have different criteria hence the variability ie first generation etc. many students get funding from both university and their dept. once into their majors. I fully support church resources supporting scholarships elsewhere (byu students are not the only good deserving people). College is an investment and expense- you seem to expect if you work hard it\u2019s free. I disagree. Even on half tuition byu students can work part time in school year and maybe a bit more in summer and have enough to pay tuition and housing and living without loans. The trend to delaying marriage is a broader multi factorial trend in emerging adulthood across all demographics- byu scholarship cutoffs I don\u2019t think can be pulled into that.",

I even saw one specifically about BYU. Average grades are increasing significantly at major institutions. The 3.95 of today is far common than the 3.95 of years ago. It\u2019s a nuanced issue, becauae you can\u2019t give A\u2019s to everyone even if they work for it, but you also don\u2019t want to give bad grades and ruin hard working student\u2019s chances at good grad school. It\u2019s a widespread phenomenon.\n\nI got a 3.5 my freshmen year, and have had a 4.0 for the last 3 years. I never saw a cent of scholarship. Is that fair? Maybe. Maybe not. I\u2019ve certainly been frustrated with it, but I can\u2019t help that scholarship is decided off of only cumulative gpas. \n\nAt the end of the day we make the best decisions for ourselves and move on.\n\nThe bell curve hasn\u2019t been around for decades",

I'd also recommend they be actual applications required for all students instead of just check boxes for those with spectacular GPAs, complete with Professor recommendations.\n\nUltimately, BYU would need to invest more in its students as those freshmen who do spectacularly deserve a scholarship like anyone.

            "comment": "There is another factor that could be oart of the consideration and that is the basis of need for the scholarship. As BYU requires all students applying for financial aid to fill out a FAFSA  form they have a good idea of the financial needs of each student and their families. While I am just speculating here it is very possible they are basing what scholarships they are giving not only on GPA but also on financial need. If the family has sufficient funds to cover full tuition it is likely that the school would prefer to give scholarship funding to a student in greater need of financial support who is working just as hard. \n\nAs evidenced by recent trends it is apparent that BYU students are coming from more and more financially well off families and as such it is not hard to imagine that the financial capability and need of a students family is being considered more highly. As the Church aims to teach self reliance to its members this may also explain some reduction in scholarships especially as Church finances are now being analyzed not only by the US but by Canada and Australia too as they are particularly interested in the large transfers of money to BYU specifically. \n\nFrom a more cynical side it may be a cost cutting measure. If your student is now eligible for federal grants this also may he considered as a way to stretch the tithing funds further. \n\nI will note that factoring the cost of a lifetime tithing into all the cost of a BYU education is odd as there is no requirement to continue to pay tithing after graduation and BYU has not, as far I know, revoked anyone\u2019s degree because of status in the Church after they attended BYU. Tithing is also income based and there are times when even the most faithful saints have no increase and their tithe may drop to very little. Additionally as the student benefits as mentioned above from $6k of support a year before scholarships when you divide up how much each member of the church is contributing to that education through tithing less that one cent of each person\u2019s tithing goes to yearly support a BYU student. \n\nBYU students are so accomplished it is rare to meet one who wasn\u2019t top of their class in something or a brilliant student it make it difficult to award on merit alone and this then turns to the needs if the student. While yes this is only speculation on my part, it feels as if the monies from tithing are being distributed more according to the law of consecration. That may seem unfair to a hard working student and if your student feels this to be an error and you are in genuine need to afford the tuition the student should contact the financial aid office and their college to discuss this need. \n\nIt is difficult to lose access to funds but there is still time and access to other funds as well as grants, student loans, and work study opportunities that your student can take advantage of. Work study cam also be beneficial to the future career of a student as there are many campus jobs which can give a student experience in their field even while attending school. Yes, there are always service jobs of cleaning buildings or cooking food but there are many other jobs that can advance a student\u2019s career giving them a leg up in applying to grad schools or their first jobs \n\nI wish your student the best in sorting out their financial aid.",

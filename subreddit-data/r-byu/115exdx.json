    "postText": "Hiya people, it's pretty obvious why I'm asking this question (I didn't get accepted into BYU). I have looked into the FlexGE program and I noticed they offer \"Independent study\". Am I able to participate in the online portion of this program without physically attending campus?\n\nI am asking, due to me living a few states away from Utah. Thank you for your time I will ask some advisors for further questions.",

            "comment": "I used to work for Continuing Education. FlexGE and Independent Study are two different programs. There can be a little overlap (you can take a couple independent study classes), but the program is mostly classes at the Salt Lake Center or evening classes on campus. You might be able to get away with doing one semester of Independent Study, but if you really want to participate in Flex GE, you need to move to Utah.",

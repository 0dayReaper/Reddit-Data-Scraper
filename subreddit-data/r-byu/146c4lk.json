    "postText": "I love helping y'all with your schedules. But stop signing up for so many classes!\n\nTaking more than 15 credits in your first semester is probably a BAD IDEA. \n\nEspecially if you are taking notoriously difficult classes, i.e. econ 110, chem 105 \n\nI graduated high school as valedictorian with a 4.0 gpa and 11 AP classes under my belt. My first semester, I took 16 credits. I didn't have a job. I got a 2.9 GPA that semester and lost my scholarship at the end of the year. Plus I changed my major two years later so I really wasted my time.\n\nYou have at least 3-4 years ahead of you. There's no rush! Take 12-14 credits and give yourself time to adjust. Replace a hard class with a lecture series or two. for many freshmen, this will be your first time living away from home, which is a huge adjustment by itself.\n\nAlso, IMO, AP classes do not really prepare you for a college class. Most high school teachers don't implement the same structure and format that you will see in a college class. My AP classes gave me false confidence in my college abilities.\n\nSqueezing in 1-2 extra classes is NOT worth starting your college career with a low gpa. Especially if you have a scholarship with gpa requirements! Prioritize that scholarship. \n\nTL;DR: Be humbler than I was, take less than 15 credits, build a solid gpa, give yourself some time to adjust to BYU.",

I cut myself off of any academic scholarships. 3 semesters of college later and my GPA is still only a 3.4. \n\nTaking 16 credits didn't even benefit me, as I ended up changing my major and losing progress in the one I \"thought\" I wanted to do. Trust the thousands of students that came before you. Take 12 credits your  first semester and get a scholarship. This will let you enjoy your Summers, as you won't be having to grind 60 hours a week at a dog food factory to pay tuition and other expenses (what I'm currently doing). \n\nNobody will think that you are a genius for taking 18 credits your first semester. Most people will spend about 3.5 seconds thinking \"that's stupid\" and will never think about it again. Do yourself a favor, please.",

If you're used to taking 6 college level classes plus two more regular classes in high school, 5 3-credit classes is a piece of cake. If your 4.0 GPA was all regular classes or if you got good grades but didn't pass the AP tests (indicating your teachers were playing easy), you might want to be more cautious.",

A scholarship is like $6k a year but you'll make more than 10 times that in a single year on the job, so you'll end up with more money by graduating on time. Also experience on the job is way more important than a higher gpa. Companies will always prefer to hire someone with a year more experience in the job than someone who had a slightly higher gpa in college, nobody even cares what your college gpa was after your first job.

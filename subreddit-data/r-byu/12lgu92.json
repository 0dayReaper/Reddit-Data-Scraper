I would agree wholeheartedly that his views on race were bigoted and in many ways a product of his time\u2014but Brigham Young was a massive proponent of and advocate for education and learning. He encouraged early Mormon pioneers to allow their children to read all kinds of books when they were afraid that doing so would \u201cpervert their children\u2019s minds.\u201d He believed in a kind of educational model that incorporated the gospel of Jesus Christ. His was a unique vision that continues to make BYU the special and high quality university that it is today. And yes, in all its flaws and shortcomings, I have still received a high quality, incredibly unique education at the university so far for which I will be eternally grateful. BYU has changed my life. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to throw the baby out with the bath water. Brigham Young is a controversial figure for sure, and a lot of his teachings and beliefs haven\u2019t aged well and aren\u2019t applicable today (many weren\u2019t applicable in his time either), but that doesn\u2019t make him a scumbag; it makes him a historical figure, and an important one for the church and BYU altogether.",

If it wasn't for him, many cities such as Las Vegas, Las Angeles and Salt Lake City would not have been what they are today. He was God's ordained prophet on the earth, the best man for the job at the time, and unfortunately he was, like all of us, human.\n\nMany great men and prophets had their faults. David over indulged and lost his salvation. Moses killed a man and doubted God to the point he was not allowed to see the promised land. Many of the founding fathers of the United States and other countries achieved greatness with next to nothing, but were personally intolerable and slave owners.\n\nThis is the biggest problem with looking at history from a modern perspective. We hold the less enough to a standard of today. Was Brigham Young racist and call for the end of ordaining black men to the priesthood? Yes. But he did not ban Africa American families from attending church, like almost EVERY OTHER CHRISTIAN DENOMINATION. It was unheard of to have integrated congregations in his time and it was done unflinchingly by the church as a whole. \n\nWhom God calls, he qualifies. Unfortunately, His imperfect tools often need sharpening that can only be gained through use.",

I wouldn't think you are either because most the high people I've spent time with don't usually spend their time belligerently trying to incite their betters on the Internet, but here we both are.\n\nWhile Lewis and Clark were admirable in their efforts I'm sure a mind with more capacity for nuance would notice I said \"settling\" and not \"exploring\". Now, my determinedly asinine troll, you may say that exploration would lead to settlement, and I would agree with you, but they are two different things. But seeing as that conclusion requires thoughtful insight, I don't think it's an argument you would make.\n\nNow, to argue the individual capacity of Brigham Young compared to Lewis and Clark would be a fascinating debate with anyone other than you, so I'll have to leave that point be.\n\nLastly to say that the \"true bad***es\" stayed on the trail until Oregon and discovered the \"True gems\" of the west seems to be a deeply personal connection of yours, and I'm not here to insult your convictions. Possibly something you could emulate should you ever consider becoming a more pleasant person.",

History is a series of lies we agree on and is completely objective to the lens we look through. By observing the past through a modern lens and progressive morals we are bound to find that no man meets the measure of today and our heroes will all disappoint us in the end. We may postulate their morality but as we see the past through, as the poet wrote, \u201ca glass darkly\u201d we will never know the truth only the reflection we see in the mirror we hold. \n\nLet us be grateful for the rough imperfections of Brigham Young and Joseph Smith lest we think them demigods and that salvation and the work of God is impossible for all but the most perfect. The past teaches us all humans even in their imperfection can do great things both fair and foul and we must do our best with the legacy we have from them. \n\nYes, Brigham Young was a Scumbag as are all humans in our fallen state.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to use \u201cscumbag\u201d as a description because it shuts down the conversation. Most people will be defensive and not hear your message. \n\nI doubt the school will change the name regardless of what comes out, unless the church gets more into Jesus than LDS leaders. Only time will tell.\n\nCurrent students/BY lovers, I do think it\u2019s valuable to learn the bad things about the leaders too so you can make fully informed decisions and contribute to the conversation constructively instead of getting defensive.

In foundations of the restoration, I learned everything about polygamy, the priesthood ban, ordered castrations, mountain meadows massacre, and all other significant Mormon history controversies. You can learn about pretty much all of these things from journals and collections in the library. \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t care a whole lot if people hate Brigham Young. I don\u2019t love a lot of what he taught and believed in. I have a problem with people lumping all 33,000 BYU students together as \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cbrainwashed\u201d or \u201cindoctrinated\u201d Mormons simply because of the university they attend\u2014one which continues to hold strong academic merit nationally regardless of it being named after a controversial figure. It\u2019s a narrow-minded and black-and-white view to hold. It\u2019s just gonna make you hate an entire group of people for illegitimate reasons, but I guess if someone wants to waste their time feeling that way, they can.

I promise you, I took extra religion classes and especially the controversial ones and they did address a few things but not in the way I\u2019ve learned since graduating. They tell you half of the story, so you know enough facts to understand why people could be upset, but they present it in a faithful way. It felt to me that they were telling us what we could say to refute criticisms. \n\nFor example, in FoTR, we were taught that Joseph Smith did have sex with at least a few of his polygamist wives, however they never said anything about the age difference. Marrying a 14 year old girl  is a lot different when you know he was 37 and he sent her dad away on a mission and her mom was dead and she was essentially his adopted daughter. \n\nThe controversies are shielded from students in a way where you\u2019re only seeing the negative things through a keyhole. So you can say \u201cI know all about polygamy\u201d but in actuality it\u2019s just a snap shot of the last bad and vague concepts. \n\nI don\u2019t think that anyone should post on a BYU sub in the combative way OP did, but I can understand the sentiment of having him specifically represent the school when he was not someone why by todays standards would be worthy of admiration.\n\nIf we have the truth, it can\u2019t be damaged with investigation. If we have not the truth, it ought to be harmed.",

I know that gets obnoxious at times, especially when it comes at the cost of telling only one side of a story, or shielding certain details to make things look cleaner than they really were. I'm aware there's still a significant amount of pressure put on professors in the religion department to avoid conversations that are actively critical of church leadership, past and present. It's an unfortunate expectation placed on these professors from the church itself. I have to hope the church learns eventually that transparency about history and mistakes is what will help young people reckon with it--not lying about it or framing it in a certain way to force students to come to certain conclusions. I do think the church and BYU have made a ton of progress in this department (especially when I talk to older BYU grads whose religion classes avoided the subjects altogether.) More work is needed, but I like to celebrate the progress that has been made. \n\nNot sure who you took FoTR from, but my professor allowed for students to think and feel critically about both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. I didn't ever leave class feeling like I had to defend Joseph's relationship with minors, or Brigham Young's racism. I also spent a great deal of time doing independent research from both Mormon and non-Mormon sources to learn more about these events and the many details surrounding them. I have yet to feel pressure from a religion professor to come to prescribed conclusions about any number of controversial Mormon history issues. If you had that experience then that is incredibly frustrating. I agree that openness and transparency about all aspects of church history is essential. \n\nOPs tone and approach is patronizing and antagonistic, and while I agree that Brigham Young had problematic views and beliefs, some of which were damaging to a variety of different groups of people and the effects of which can still be felt today--it was he who had the vision and desire to start a school like BYU. In my opinion, there are positive aspects of the university that exist because of Brigham Young, not in spite of him. I'm just not sure why we have to have a \"but\" attitude instead of an \"and\" one. Brigham Young was racist AND he had views on education that were quite progressive for both the church and the broad cultural society in which he existed. I can hold both of those realities comfortably, but it seems a lot of people nowadays have a hard time doing that.",

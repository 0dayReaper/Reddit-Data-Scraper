    "postText": "So my wife has now wasted the better part of two days in the past week fighting the incompetence of Examity for a son who was taking a high school class through BYU. \n\n**Day 1**\nMy wife was working to help get my 16 year old son set up to take the exam. At the start of the interaction, neither my son couldn't understand the instructions being given by the person on the other end because of a language barrier. So, he called my wife into the room to help him try to understand. She couldn't understand the person either, but she at least asked to talk to someone else because they couldn't understand. The next person spoke English that was much easier to understand. However, that person told her that she couldn't be in the room while he took the test and that she needed to leave the room.\n\nAfter a few minutes, our son came out of the room and told my wife that the person from Examity was asking for permission to take control of his computer so that they could type in a password. This is the tell-tale sign of a phishing attack. Why on planet earth is a legitimate institution like BYU contracting with an overseas company that is asking for permission to take control of each computer of the people being tested? Super, super phishy (pun intended). My wife didn't feel comfortable doing that and said she wanted to talk to the BYU testing center before proceeding, so Examity hung up on her via the testing system. She called the BYU Testing Center and they claimed that is just how the process works (again why employ a company that requires phishing-like behavior just to take an exam?!?!?). I might add that my older son took the same course last year and there weren't any of these issues, though he doesn't remember if it was the same company who was proctoring the exam.\n\nHowever, when the person hung up on my wife, the test was marked as \"incomplete\" by someone at Examity and he had to wait 4 hours to petition BYU Testing Center to reset it. Ugh...day wasted.\n\n**Day 2**\nThey decide to just go ahead with the sketchy process of getting signed into Examity for testing. However, after getting signed in, the camera wasn't working for some reason and that is required. So, they pulled up the help chat to ask for help. They had followed all the steps of giving permission to the web app from the OS that should allow it. After spending 60 minutes with 15 minutes between each response from the person on the other side, which I might add is 25% of the total time allowed to take the test, the help technician said to sign out and then sign back in again. When they tried this, his exam was marked as incomplete (not in progress like the technician said it would be) and he now has to wait another 4 hours to petition for the testing center to reset it.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have had a ridiculously bad experience with the online testing center this last week. I hope this is a one-off experience, because it seems like a really, really bad company that they have contracted for proctoring.",

I did an online class last year and had the choice to take my exams in person (the Harman building on campus) or through Examity, and the test proctor on campus still has to input the password just like the Examity proctor does. I\u2019ve had mixed experiences with Examity proctors. Some were nearly incomprehensible while others were okay. I think one fell asleep while I was taking my exam, because when I finished it took a few kind of loud \u201cexcuse me\u201ds to get her attention for the post-test instructions.",

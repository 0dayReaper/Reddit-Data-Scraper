    "postText": "BYU Law will be holding its **Religious Freedom Annual Review** (*its free for all BYU students and 7 CLE credit hours if those apply to you*) and will be discussing some interesting topics this year:\n\n*  What is driving a departure from traditional religious communities?\n   * Is this a reaction to politicized religion, a result of increasing secularism, a move to a more eclectic or non-institutional approach to religiosity?\n* What do we lose when we move away from communities of believers?\n* What are the implications for the religious freedom of denominations, religious schools, religiously affiliated charitable organizations, and other religious institutions?\n* For some, institutional religion is seen as problematic, if not harmful. How can those of us who are part of religious institutions be both true to our beliefs and more welcoming to those who are unlike us or unsure whether to belong?\n* How can we strengthen our society through the communities where we worship and practice our beliefs?\n\n[Here's](https://religiousfreedom.byu.edu/home) a direct link for registration if you're curious to even only stream specific topics/speakers.",

That origin is disingenuous to the reader and so in a rebuttal you have to discuss the historical context first. Jeremy crowdsourced the revisions to the title and questions specifically from church antagonists to be effective in targeting those who might be on their way out or struggling in their faith. His goal was and is to destroy faith.\n\nIf it truly is/was honest. It would have the forward to the effect of, 'I'm basically out anyway and I keep researching and finding new things that bother me. Maybe they'll bother you too'.\n\nThe book is about **him** and **his** questions and so each section has to be addressed in that specific context and perspective.",

In the interview she was so personable and like a grandma the same feel Gordon hinckley had. Jeremy's mormon stories didn't have nearly the same feel. But the personality didn't really affect the ideas. \n\nMaking personal attacks to a person or their writing style does a disservice to any sort of actual substantive argument later contained. I quit browsing those links cause personal insults are boring and I didn't make it to any sort of substantive argument. \n\nMaybe that works for some but for me that is how it worked.",

He did that on purpose because if they did know the context, it wouldn't be as effective pulling people out of the church as they wouldn't make it the forward. That's my point: he's disingenuous on purpose. He's going after faith-leaning fence sitters who wouldn't read something written by an antagonist on purpose, so it has to be sly in its introduction and Jeremy admits this. \n\nRegardless, you could pick one of the topics in the CES Letter and I can cut out all of the context tied to Jeremy in the collection and it would still work. It's pretty normal for reading to have to skim by markers that bother you about any particular author, especially if it's outside your comfort zone. I have to do it with the CES Letter and you would have to do it with a rebuttal.",

No.  But plenty of people do not want to even imagine that it might all be a lie.  Surprise, surprise.  It is.",

I\u2019ve heard people say half and others say it changes but what have you or others you\u2019ve known received?",

            "comment": "It's a need based scholarship. I can't tell you how much you'll get, you need to do FAFSA and sit down with your assigned MSS advisor to make sure you don't miss anything. Also, you're expected to remain full-time (12 credits). \n\nI get a quarter tuition per semester. That's the minimum (I don't qualify for any other need based scholarship). I know some people with more need that get half. I even know a non-member that gets full member tuition paid for, so he only covers the other half.\n\nAlso, you can have full academic scholarships and still take MSS money. They pay for my health insurance and books.\n\nSometimes, they're willing to fully fund Spring/Summers. I don't believe you need to be full time for that. Academic scholarships have covered my Spring/Summers, and you can't get full academic and MSS money in that case.",

On the other hand, I know a few POC students that didn't do SOAR that applied but didn't get it.\n\nThe amount you get isn't based on SOAR attendance. It really is based on financial need. My parents are genuinely financially okay and could've covered full tuition, so I got the minimum amount, or quarter member tuition.",

They'll also tell you when it's an unclear situation.\n\nI remember I asked for more money one time and was very bluntly told no. They want to be transparent.",

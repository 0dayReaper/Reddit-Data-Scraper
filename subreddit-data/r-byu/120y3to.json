            "comment": "They\u2019ve changed the admissions process to only let you talk about two extracurricular activities, and go more in depth on how they improved you, so quantity of those matter a lot less now. \n\nMiddle 50% GPA is actually exactly 3.86. Average SAT is 1290-1440, not sure how that compares there.\n\nI\u2019ve heard they are really focusing on essays as of late. Seems like you\u2019ve got the scores to definitely get in, but nothing that is exceptionally standout for applicants. I\u2019d focus a lot on your essays, and it\u2019s really hard to say what your odds are with those.\n\nAlso the admission rate seems to be going up after dropping for years, last year it was almost 70% for freshman applicants if that takes away from some stress.",

Now that covid has let up, those same would-be freshmen went on missions, ergo fewer folks are applying, ergo acceptance rate of those applying is higher than they have been. \n\nCome fall 2024 the rate will be comparable to what it was pre covid, discounting any other extraneous factors.",

Looking into it though it is intriguing.\n\nLooks like it had an all-time low actually in 2014-2016 with around 50%. Started climbing up earlier than I thought getting to ~65% in 2018 through 2021. 2022 had a drop to ~59% and then the acceptance for 2023 went back up to almost 70%. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it go down again, but it seems to live in the 50-65% range",

It's a program for multicultural students to learn about BYU and take the ACT. You'll come into BYU with a scholarship as well.\n\nDM me if you need any details.",

Just make sure that you actually put good work into your essays, as they are probably most important. I know people with 4.0s and higher ACT scores than me that didn't get in because they speedran their essays. They don't have to be crazy good, but just make sure you put some effort into them.",

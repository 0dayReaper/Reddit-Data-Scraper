I hope these employees know, you are loved and we care about you. Whatever the company is putting you through, run and don't come back it's not worth it! If your in this group, I hope your doing OK.",

I wasn't saying it doesn't happen or that there aren't reasons someone at BYU might work or shop on Sunday. All I was saying is the odds are low, not that they're zero.\n\nDang, I love it when I use the correct and generalized words to make a point and then someone comes along thinking they're clever and they're like \"Ah, but did you think of x?\" When, in fact, I did, and my language represented x correctly without explicitly mentioning it. Redditors have no nuance. It is the same thing where if you say \"Y marginalized group faces &lt;problem&gt;\" then people come along and say \"but you're disregarding C group!\" when you weren't, you just weren't talking about C at the time.",

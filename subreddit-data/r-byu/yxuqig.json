I don't know what about free airpumps incentivizes people to break them, I really don't understand.\n\nAlso a tire pressure gauge is like $5 or less, keep it in your glovebox\n\nAlternately, now is a great time to update your christmas lists to include a portable air pump that plugs into cigarette lighter input in car.",

I have a gauge that I keep in my car, but paid pumps are just so expensive recently (like $1.50 for 2 mins!) that I should really think about getting the cigarette lighter tire pump.\n\nUpdate: I stopped by the chev by LES and it\u2019s a paid vacuum/pump combo unfortunately",

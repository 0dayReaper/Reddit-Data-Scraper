            "comment": "it\u2019s an amazing major! it\u2019s actually an emphasis under the family life major (i\u2019m family life with an emphasis in family studies). within the human development emphasis you can further specialize by choosing either the human development or biological foundations track. overall you learn about child and lifespan development, stats, research, parenting, adolescence, addiction, relationships, childhood education and more. there\u2019s tons of really good research to go into with it (i\u2019m doing a practicum for the CREATE project next semester) which is what most people are looking to pursue with human development. i\u2019m planning to go to grad school to become a marriage and family therapist (which is a little more specific to the family studies emphasis but you can still totally do with human development). graduates in this major also become employed in childcare centers, juvenile correction programs, residential treatment centers, counseling clinics, and other community services professions. the school of family life is the best at byu so i\u2019d strongly recommend taking sfl 101, sfl 210, and/or sfl 160 if you\u2019re interested in it!",

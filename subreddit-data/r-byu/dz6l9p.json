I really appreciate that BYU felt more like my current office job than a typical college campus.\n\nBut if the purpose of the Honor Code is to keep the university spiritual and professional, why are beards banned, which are neither against our religion, nor seen as unprofessional by the professional world?  You can love the Honor Code and still think it needs to be updated slightly to keep with the times.",

I actually like the Honor Code and I chose BYU because of it (even though I wasn't a practicing Mormon when I applied -- oops) but I disagree with some of the things in the code. The beard thing is definitely outdated. I feel like the only reason they haven't changed it is they don't want to make it look like they're caving under pressure and setting a precedent.",

    "postText": "I understand this type of post may not be appropriate for this sub but I just need to get this off my chest somewhere.\n\nLet me start out by saying I love everything about BYU. It\u2019s been my dream to attend here ever since I was 6 and I count this to be one of the greatest blessings in my life. I am someone who struggles in school and so I got rejected twice before finally making it in, and now I have a 4.0 here. I especially love the professors and how many of them are sacrificing lucrative careers to come teach at BYU because they believe in its mission. I am humbled by the incredible faculty and feel a strong kinship to my fellow students.\n\nFor most of my life I have suffered with same-sex attraction (for the record, I don\u2019t support the LGBT agenda and I don\u2019t think the church should change its policy). It\u2019s been a really hard struggle and no one really knows about it. I still obey the law of chastity and on paper I am still worthy of my ecclesiastical endorsement. I have tried many therapies and tactics to try and change my situation but nothing seems to work.\n\nI don\u2019t plan on ever dating men or being sexually active, but my mental health has been so messed up over this issue sometimes I wonder if I will continue in church membership in the future. Seeing happy families sometimes makes me envious and resentful, and I just hate that I feel this way.\n\nThe other day I was meeting with a professor and she is such a kind and genuine professor who wants her students to succeed. She is such an amazing person and she views her students as her investment in building the kingdom of God. Right after the meeting I just broke down sobbing. I felt like if the professors really knew who I was, they would feel differently and feel like their help is in vain.\n\nWhile I love BYU with all my heart, sometimes I feel like there are students who are more deserving of my spot and who are more likely to use their education to build an eternal family and continue in faithful membership. It has started to really gnaw at me. I\u2019m a junior so transferring is kind of difficult, but it might give me a clean conscience knowing someone more deserving is there in place of me.\n\nI would appreciate any advice on this subject. I promise this post isn\u2019t just some exmormon bait, I am genuinely looking for faithful perspectives on my situation.",

He's a religion professor, but also one of the leading researchers in the nation on LGBTQ and religion. I took Eternal Families from him, and he is incredibly loving and kind towards everyone. He has a lot of great data-backed info about how to be both a happy, active member of the Church and someone who deals with same-sex attraction.",

And that includes both those who are living celibate lives within the church and those who've embraced their identities outside the church (more of the latter, but certainly several of the former). \n\nWhat I've never, ever met is someone with same-sex attraction who is (or was) happy at BYU. Between idiot 20-somethings who mistake a lack of empathy for personality, an inflexible honor code office, and bishopric roulette, I honestly don't think you'll ever manage to feel accepted, safe, or honest there. \n\nThe question you have to ask yourself really isn't whether you deserve the school, nor is it how you can be accepted, safe, and honest while attending. Instead, the question is whether you can survive there, and whether the damage it does is worth the benefits from staying. \n\nAnd sadly, the only one who can do that cost/benefit check is you.",

Different things make different people happy. I understand why many people couldn't be happy at BYU. I would have struggled at BYU (not a fan of arbitrary rules) for completely different reasons than you would have.\n\nMaybe the people I know didn't define themselves by their sexuality.

Maybe they (like me) just went to class and went home without so much as considering getting involved in anything on campus outside of showing up to class. Maybe there were other aspects of the BYU experience that they enjoyed.\n\nFor you to suggest that sexual/romantic fulfillment is the only way one could be happy is ridiculous. What about people who are cognitively capable enough to understand romantic love, they have a desire to obtain it, but there are such barriers to it that it simply won't realistically happen? They just don't get to be happy? That is nonsense. I've met plenty of people who lead unfulfilled lives from a romance standpoint that were very happy people.\n\nIs it easy to be happy under such circumstances? Of course not, not by a mile. In my experience, it takes an incredibly strong person to overcome such things and live a happy life, but to suggest it can't be done simply because you don't understand how is foolish.",

You don't struggle with same sex attraction; you are gay and you struggle with loving yourself.\n\nI can't tell you how to balance this with the church, but I don't think anyone who actually cares about you would blame you if you decided the church wasn't for you. You deserve to be happy, and sometimes that means separating yourself from it all. If you decide to stay in the church, that's great too, but life will probably be very difficult for you.\n\nI would encourage you to put yourself out there and find other gay people at BYU.

It\u2019s a normal, healthy, thing that lots of amazing people are. Being gay doesn\u2019t make you any less of a man. There is as much variation in types of gay people as there are gay people. I myself am not gay, not a Mormon, and have only been to Utah once for a wedding, so take my advice for what it is, but for whatever reason your post popped up and I can\u2019t help but feel terrible reading about the fact that you feel as though something as normal as being homosexual makes you unworthy of anything. My brother is gay and he struggled for a long time trying to hide it from me and the rest of our catholic family out of fear. I love my brother and in many ways feel as though I failed to make him comfortable enough to be who he was and no one deserves that. Here is my advice:\n\nYour education is that: an education. If you are capable of learning and working hard there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t achieve whatever goals you have. Whose pants you want to dance in makes no difference. Just look at Alan Turing: he basically invented the modern computer and is widely regarded as being a massive reason the Allies won in WW2. He was a brilliant mathematician and was also gay. \n\nYour religion as a whole will not accept you. I cant see the future, and maybe one day they will change their policies like they did with POC, but to go a lifetime without experiencing a loving and erotic embrace of another human is a form of hell. You will be pressured to marry a woman. Unless you are a bisexual, you will not love her in the way you would a man. She will want to have sex and you will not be turned on by her unless you are bisexual. \n\nYour friends and family might not accept you. BE SAFE if you decide to come out to them. It is ok to lie if you feel your safety and well-being may be in jeaprody. If you do feel safe, and you do decide to tell them, and they don\u2019t accept you, they are not your friends. You are not gross, you are not abnormal, there is nothing wrong with you, and no one who is your friend will make you feel that way. \n\nYou cannot will yourself into being something you are not. You cannot pray yourself into being something you are not. You are who you are and the sooner you embrace that, the happier your life will be. \n\nDo not fear utilization of resources. Get a therapist who is accepting of homosexuality. You might have to get a secular therapist who understands the complexities of balancing religious sexual morality and homosexuality. I know the word \u201csecular\u201d is scary, but it isn\u2019t as hard as you think to find a therapist who is sympathetic to religion and sexuality and can help you find the inner peace you deserve. You do not have to leave your religion, but it\u2019s highly likely this is taking a mental toll and therapy can make a huge difference.\n\nThere is no \u201cgay agenda\u201d. You might think if you\u2019ve met one gay person, you\u2019ve met them all, but that\u2019s not the case. If you\u2019ve met one gay person, you\u2019ve met one gay person. Some are amazing people. Some are terrible people. Some have years of trauma and baggage, others have been loved their whole lives. Most are just average people who want to live their lives and love who they love. I know you might feel alone and Im biased being that I am not in the Mormon community, but I know a ton of gay people who just live as normal people. I suspect there are a TON of gays in the church who just hide it. \n\nGay men have happy families all the time. They might not look like the typical Mormon family, but you can live a very happy life embracing homosexual love. That\u2019s up to you. You are facing an enormous amount of social incentives to not do that. You\u2019ve likely been taught your whole life that homosexuality is wrong and that the gay lifestyle is unholy and the people who do it are unhappy. That\u2019s all a bunch of crap. Being Mormon is a choice, being gay is not. It might be better to reconcile your religion with your sexuality than your sexuality with your religion. \n\nWelp. That\u2019s just my 2 cents.",

It was never a sin. I also highly recommend talking with the pastor/minister/reverend of a gay friendly church, and hear their opinions on the topic. Most are MUCH more educated than I am on this issue with Bible translations. \n\nLet\u2019s just, make up this scenario in which you do decide to enter a relationship with another male. If you both help each other, life each other up when you are down, take care of each other when you are sick, push each other to achieve your goals, and lastly help each other to keep with the faith, how could God smite you down for that?",

The victim is rendered desolate and hopeless, because every relationship that veers into romance or intimacy becomes tainted by shame and stripped of the value you would otherwise attribute to it.  A god who loves you would not demand you go through such a half-life.\n\nWhatever you decide to do with your faith is your own business, but you will not find happiness or peace until you accept yourself.  You aren't broken, you aren't cursed to live an empty life bereft of love, and you should stop letting others tell you thats all you're good for.  You deserve all the love and joy this world has to offer, because that's why we are here: to have joy. And you can't do that if you keep hating an intrinsic part of yourself.\n\nBeing gay doesn't make you promiscuous.  It doesnt make you immoral. It doesnt make you dirty and sinful.  Its just the way you were made to feel love.  It took me far too long to learn that lesson.  I hope it comes to you much sooner.",

You are gay, and will be gay your entire life, no matter if you marry a woman and have a passel of children. (Don't do that, it's not fair to your wife)\n\nGod did not set you up at the butt of a cruel joke - that you must be celibate and feel like crap.  That's not what God does, that's what people do. And the church is wrong, no matter how they are trying to make things look better under this president, \"allowing\"  celibate gays to be second class in the church.  It's no different that when they church suddenly decided after a bunch of lawsuits that being black didn't prevent black men from holding the priesthood.  This WILL change, possibly in your lifetime. (edited for clarity)\n\nMaybe talk to a therapist?  Someone who can help you with your feelings of self loathing and shame, and let you become the gay man you can be, rather than one crippled by others.",

I'd be hesitant to assume that he made a mistake or that he doesn't want every type of happiness for you, especially given the Church's track record of changing doctrine about what constitutes an eternal family. Remember, for 76% of the Church's existence, the official doctrine was that black people could not have eternal families (and yes, it was doctrine, not policy - see the 1949 First Presidency statement). And of course before that, the doctrine about polygamy changed. This shows how little anybody understands about God's will and intentions, but we know that he created 5% or more of his children to be LGBT, so clearly nobody is a bigger supporter of \"the LGBT agenda\" (lol) than God himself.\n\nWe already know that God created us through evolution.

            "comment": "You are just as deserving as anyone else who goes to BYU. You're sexuality does not make you undeserving or unworthy to be a student at BYU or even a member of the church. However, it is a long and lonely road and one that can be difficult because you are choosing to give up relationships and pleasure for your faith. That is a hard choice and that is between you and God but it doesn't make you any less valuable because you have to make that choice. You are not making a choice about same sex attraction that is who you are and you will have to make peace with that. The choice is what you do after that.   \n\n\nIf your BYU experience is causing you trauma or hurting you then transferring may be the correct answer but just because you are gay doesn't mean that you cannot have a fulfilling finish to your BYU Career and even if you want to continue to be active in the church.   \n\n\nAs to building the kingdom. God will build the kingdom with any tools that he has on hand. You will read in Church history about imperfect leaders who still, in spite of their very apparent imperfections, were still instrumental to building the kingdom. God uses imperfect people like you and me to bring for better things.   \n\n\nI know it is hard right now but things will get better as you come to understand that you are loved, you belong, and whatever you choose there are those that will support you. Also you are not alone. Many students come to BYU who are LGBTQIA+ and they come because they have faith and they don't want to divide their world or themselves.  They may struggle with urges, as most young adults do, they may struggle with finding a place they fit, they may struggle with understanding their faith. Many struggle with depression, anxiety, and hopelessness thinking that they are so alone. You and they are not alone and the Professors, staff, and administration is here to help you. I bet your professor would still be 100% happy to help still even if you came out to her and you talked about your struggles. People rarely become professors because they don't want to help students in anyway possible.   \n\n\nI am sure should you need there many people who are willing to help you both here on Reddit and in person.   \n\n\nI hope this helps.",

I don\u2019t believe that any loving god would put his children through that torture, it is against the nature of an all-loving being to do so.

So is there some other reason you think it\u2019s wrong to be gay? \n\nIn another comment you say that it\u2019s not for procreation, but I sincerely doubt God created love attraction solely for the sake of procreation. Bugs and rodents procreate far, far more efficiently than we do, but God likely doesn\u2019t hold bugs and pests in higher esteem than us. Romance and love have a purpose in their own right- it\u2019s about connection with another human being, and that is something that God cherishes and wants us all to cherish to. Do you really think God wants you to deny yourself that part of the human experience all because of something you cannot control?\n\nI hope you can find a way to accept yourself, OP.",

This line, was the most troubling from your post \u201cfor the record, I don\u2019t support the LGBT agenda.\u201d Experiencing same sex attraction does not exempt someone from internalizing homophobia. Regardless of your orientation or attraction, comments like that show that you might have internal biases against some of Heavenly Father\u2019s children to work through. This isn\u2019t just about policing language or arguing semantics, rather it\u2019s about diving into your core beliefs and unpacking surface level sound bites. I think that if you if you dig into what the phrase \u201cthe LGBT agenda\u201d means to you, you might come to any number of more specific concepts like: some LDS member\u2019s desire to allow all gender sealings to be performed in the temple; demonizing of a heteronormative culture and practices that are common in western/american society; equal exposure of same and opposite gender relationships to children and youth; removing stigmatization of same sex romantic relationships; legalizing gender expression in public; adjustments to church handbooks to include more inclusive language for gender or sexual minorities; more legal protections for people experiencing gender dysphoria; etc. etc. \n\nOnce you figure out exactly what you mean by the phrase \u201cLGBT agenda\u201d you can start to look at those individual pieces and figure out which of those you believe are good and which are bad. \n\nSome ways to sort and filter those could be deep discussions with people who you can be honest with and you know will challenge you to think deeply and reconsider your beliefs; reading and researching the topic and studying out what experts have learned; searching the scriptures or, while considering a particular point, reading from the scriptures and pondering on how it might relate; planting the concept in your heart and reevaluating it over time to see if it is good, and if the fruits of that idea are good (Alma 32); and of course, praying and seeking guidance from heavenly parents about it. \n\nThis is a long process, but truly engaging the details of what you believe can help you find a sense of resonance and congruence with yourself. \nBut also therapy. That would be good to! ;)\n\nBest of luck!\n\nP.s. trust me, as a Gay student who has talked to a lot of professors, most of them (and all the good ones) aren\u2019t feeling like they\u2019re wasting their time when they help students who struggle with their relationship to the church or may end up leaving.",

When my older sister left the church, I realized that I was hoping that the church wasn\u2019t true. Because if the plan of salvation is true, I wouldn\u2019t be with her for eternity. After I realized that, I was able to deconstruct my faith and start to realize how many holes there are in the gospel and understand that the only reason I ever believed in it was because I had been spoon fed since birth. \nLife is meant to be enjoyed and to spread kindness to the people around you. If you go through life learning how to take care of yourself and the people around you, then you have nothing to worry about in the next life because an all-mighty God would not keep someone like that out of Heaven.",

                            "comment": "You know, growing up, my mom had a trio of friends. Phil and Ashley. Both of whom were gay. Ashley is a strong, faithful mormon. She loves herself, and she loves making connections with other women the way straight women do with men. Being gay isn\u2019t something to be frightened of. The only frightening thing is the idea that you can hide this the rest of your life. You can\u2019t. Those that manage to end up doing so living exceedingly lonely, spiritually tortured lives.\n\nI\u2019ve never asked Ashley how she remains such a devout lifestyle while living with and loving another woman. I suppose I simply haven\u2019t seen her since I was mature enough to ask that question in a respectable enough manner. But what she has said to one was \u201cI will still follow the church and do everything I can do support our teachings and religion even though I am gay. Loving Carol as I do, taking care of her, giving her confidence, making her happy, I don\u2019t believe that in the end that God should smite me down for improving the life of another person through love, just because we share the same anatomy, especially when I work as hard as I can to spread our message.\u201d Something along those lines. \n\nMaybe take Ashley as an example. Fun, loving, beyond kind. She\u2019s active in the church. She may not tell everyone in the church she is gay, although should they ask she would not lie. She has taught a majority of the Mormon population in Indianapolis through herself that gay people deserve a place within the kingdom of god for their work and faith as much as any person. Everyone sins every single day, being gay just happens to be something that churches focus on. In addition, if you were to engage in a relationship with a man - a long stretch, you don\u2019t have to commit, I understand the idea is horrifying right now - the amount of love you would be elevated to would be astronomical, especially considering the amount of love you have for your family in the church already. You can always adopt, and spread the teaching to children that way. So many children need families and love, you could offer than alongside a partner much more than you could offer that sort of love to biological children with a woman you can never emotionally love to the core all while hiding a secret. \n\nIt\u2019s all up to you, but please don\u2019t hide it or try to make it go away. God made you this way for a purpose, and perhaps Ashley feels the same. She is teaching the church that gay people have a place, can be kind, loving, intelligent, and can spread the teaching and love through adoption, an arguably more honorably act than biologically making children. \n\nAnyway, I pray and hope everyday that you find happiness and eternal love. Do not deprive yourself of that because a majority of Mormons don\u2019t understand. Be like Ashley. Lead and change. Include more people. Gay children will hide in fear and indulge in addictive behaviors and leave homes. You and every gay Mormon has the power to change that.",

            "comment": "I have a couple of thoughts, but don't take my opinion too seriously.  I haven't been where you are.\n\nFirst thought: since you're in a place where you don't intend to ever act on the same-sex attraction you feel, I think most of the professors will look at you as a poster child for how your situation should be handled.  I dont know what sharing openly might do for your future callings, but I think you're still firmly on the \"covenant path\".  \n\nSecond thought: Whatever the reasons might be for same-sex attraction, be careful not to vilify yourself.  Church leaders have made the church's position clear.  If anybody tries to shame you or make you feel guilty for the path you've chosen (meaning staying celibate and treating your attraction as a challenge to be faced/overcome) they have something to repent for.  You don't.  \n\nThird thought: a friend of mine chose to act on his same-sex attraction.  He and his boyfriend left BYU-I together and chose to pursue a life together.  This friend's family was warm and accepting, but he said he'd never be sure if his parents felt the same about his boyfriend as they do about his SiL.  He described the occasion of bringing his boyfriend home as going \"better than he could have hoped for\".  That's what actually made me leave the church.  When it wasn't about my feelings anymore, but was about the possibility that I could put one of my own children in that position,  suddenly the church and its teachings fell short.  I realized I'd rather raise my children without the church or its teachings than have a child have to face this life without true connection, love, and companionship.  I would rather pay any price for whatever activity this alleged god thought of as sinful than let my children miss out on what has been the best part of my life by far.\n\nWhatever path you take moving forward, you should and will have good people in your corner.  You may lose some connections by opening up about how you feel, but im certain you'll gain others.  I suspect those that you gain will more than make up for any friends/connections you lose over time.  That being said, I'm sure it must be scary, and I don't know how it feels to face these choices in real life.  I'm putting good vibes out into the universe for you, and I wish you nothing but happiness and peace on your journey.",

I can\u2019t imagine how it must feel trying to navigate through the LDS church as someone who is gay. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to tell you to leave. That\u2019s for every person to figure out for themselves, but when you said that you have \u201cstruggled\u201d with same sex attraction, that should be a red flag. Your sexual attraction shouldn\u2019t be something you need to struggle with. It is what it is and only in places like the LDS church will you feel the need to say things like you\u2019re \u201cstruggling\u201d with it. \n\nAlso, the LGBTQ \u201cagenda\u201d is about equality and acceptance of who you are. It\u2019s a group that would support YOU for who you are.",

            "comment": "I have never personally experienced same-sex attraction, but I have ADHD. I know what it feels like to have pieces of yourself that seem inseparable from your identity and rub wrong against the expectations of life in the church. I struggle with similar issues connected to my PTSD, PPD, and anxiety, but I can\u2019t say that those have necessarily been a part of my life as long as I can remember; I *can* say that about my ADHD symptoms.\n\nThe last few years have forced some deep introspection into how I view and understand my worth as a Child of God, and how my spirit and body interact with each other. I have learned a lot about the nature of charity, and about moving forward with faith when I wish I could just give it all up and let someone \u201cmore deserving\u201d take over. I have also learned a lot about the importance of seeking professional counsel and help, when appropriate, for expanding my understanding and for supporting my mental health.\n\nWe *need* people who experience life differently than the average member. We *need* souls brave enough to let their faith win out over their burdens. We *need* people whose testimonies will lead them through the gaps in their understanding and the understanding of the world. We *need* people with differences to show the world that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is led by *their* Savior and has room for *their* soul. We need those things in the world, in our church, *and* at BYU.\n\nIf the Lord is telling you that you should be elsewhere, then by all means transfer to another school. But don\u2019t run away because of fear and uncertainty. Easier said than done, I know. Being gay is a part of your experience, but that does not make it \u201cwho you are\u201d. The most essential identity is your identity as Child of God. All else is further out and can be figured out.\n\nI encourage you to talk to someone. Struggles in the dark grow stronger; turn the light on. Reach out to communities that respect the reality of your testimony *and* your ssa. Find a therapist who can help you work through your negative self-view in a way that is respectful of your  desire to remain an active member. Find some professors or literature that explore ssa openly through the lense of a believer of The Church of Jesus Christ.\n\nThere are lessons to learn, lives to touch, and treasures of knowledge to be found by people who are motivated to look. You have an opportunity to understand and teach what many good people in this world cannot yet grasp. This opportunity comes by some measure of pain, but, if you can let the Lord lead you, the world will be so much the better for it.\n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure what my point is here, but I wanted to let you know that you\u2019re not alone in struggling to understand how the Savior\u2019s gospel has room for *you*. And while my struggles have not magically disappeared, my choice to stay in the gospel has blessed my life and those around me. It is not a choice free of suffering, but it is one that is fundamentally changing me bit by bit, day by day.",

Now I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the path you\u2019re on, but it is a possibility. He loves his wife very much. \n\nThe savior loves you and wants so badly for you to succeed and be happy. It might not feel like it but you aren\u2019t alone. Feel free to PM if you have questions or want to talk\n\nYou\u2019re definitely meant to be here.

Please know that you belong and that you are not less-than. You have unique traits that are needed there as part of the body of Christ.

You are beautiful and amazing just how you are and you don\u2019t need a church to tell you that. You don\u2019t need to try to change this part of you at all. You\u2019ll find that if you accept it and you find love this way you\u2019ll be so much happier than you ever could be while suppressing yourself. There will always be people who will welcome and love you, even if it\u2019s not there, so don\u2019t be afraid. Good luck, I really hope you can realize you aren\u2019t wrong and you can be true to yourself.",

Do your actions follow the honor code while you're attending? Then nothing to feel guilty about!\n\nTrust me, people are way more loving that I think you give them credit for. You sound great, don't be so hard on yourself.",

I'm a bisexual woman who has also been really messed up mentally as I started falling for my best friend.\nFirst and foremost, remember that there is absolutely nothing wrong with you and your attractions. God did not make a mistake in making you and he does not see you as any less. You do not have to justify your attractions by clarifying to everyone just how much you are a part of the church. God knows your heart and devotion to him and he is and will always be the only one who's opinion of you matters.\nSecondly, having feelings for people is natural. It's healthy and it's okay. After struggling with my attraction to my friend for several months I finally opened up to her and all she had to say was that she already knew and that what I was feeling was perfectly normal.\n\nIf you haven't already heard of it, I would recommend listening to the podcast Questions From the Closet. It's by two strong gay members of the church who work at BYU. I think it might really help.",

You belong at BYU, and we want you! Everyone has their own unique struggles, so just because yours are this rather than something else doesn't make you any less worthy to be here. I too have faith in the gospel and support our church's policy. I don't know what God's plan is for you, but I promise that He has one and is aware of what you're going through. I will pray for you to receive peace, however that may be that God sees fit &lt;3",

Everyone has things about themselves that are out of their control to one degree or another, and that make it difficult to keep one commandment or another. The Book of Mormon calls it \"the natural man.\"  I call it \"genetic and environmental factors.\" \n\nWhen I'm feeling bad about myself because I have such a hard time doing or thinking in a way I consider right, I think of this verse in the Book of Mormon.  \n\n&gt;And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them. (Ether 12:27)\n\nA lot of people only focus on the last part, but if God is going to turn my weaknesses into strengths, he sure is taking a long time for some of them.  In the meantime, I try to focus on the first part.  God gave me \"weakness\" ON PURPOSE, so that I can develop HUMILITY.  Humility is NOT beating yourself up for your perceived flaws.",

Or is it too late and I just have to deal with extra fees? Any suggestions are very much appreciated, thank you.",

If that\u2019s the case you\u2019ll have to buy the book (it\u2019ll show up in the financial center portal). If it\u2019s used, not new, it will not be as expensive as a new book.\n\nHOWEVER, I think you can sell the book in the winter semester back to BYU. I don\u2019t know if it will be the same price. You\u2019re going to have to talk with the BYU store about it early next semester.\n\nIt happens. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re not the first or the last person to make this mistake. \ud83d\udc4d",

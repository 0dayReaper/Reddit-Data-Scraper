    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm making a presentation in my class about whether BYU's tickets are legally binding (and whether or not you legally have to pay them). Acknowledging that BYU can keep you from graduating if you don't pay them because they are a private institution, it's more a matter of tracking down the relevant codes etc.\n\nTo this end I was wondering if anyone would be willing to comment a photo of their parking ticket. Feel free to cross out your license plate, or other personal information but if possible just tell me what nature the crossed out information was (ex if you cross out your license plate # just let me know that the # was on the ticket).\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "While the parking tickets in theory should keep you from graduating if you don't pay them the there seems to be a great deal of mercy from the bursar about not paying the tickets and still being able to graduate. That being said you can get an honor code violation for parking in the wrong places, though that kind of enforcement is not regularly used it is possible to find yourself in the honor code office for parking tickets. Fun times there.   \n\n\nAs to legally binding I had a friend who got a bunch of parking tickets during his time at the University of Texas Austin and never paid them figuring they were just campus things he wouldn't have to worry about and it was his dad's car anyway until the Austin police department put out a warrant for his father's arrest for flagrant parking violations and fines. So depending on the laws in the state it is possible to suffer real ramifications for parking tickets at a University. Haven't' heard something that extreme at BYU though.",

                    "comment": "Yeah that's basically what I've found, the goal though is to track down the specific laws that make that kind of enforcement legal. So far I've tracked down three codes between Utah State codes and Provo ordinances that back up this sort of enforcement. The connection that I'm missing is at what point the case switches from being private (and handled by BYU security) to public (handled by the police).\n\nIn order for someone at BYU to get into a position where the state is issuing a warrant, the BYU \"citations\" would have to be turned over to the actual police, who would then have to decide that they care what is happening on BYU's private property. Which is why BYU has their own \"police department\" of almost retired cops who have nothing better to do than worry about dumb stuff like parking tickets. The other thing is that I believe UTAA is public, which would make their parking basically public as well, and the responsibility of actual police I believe? Idk... this assignment is getting out of hand.\n\nI also heard from a professor that if you search up BYU's public case files you can find instances of BYU suing people over unpaid parking tickets.",

BYU parking is a division of the BYU police and gets their pay from the department. I don't know how far their enforcement or jurisdiction extends though. \n\nI had an old roommate who worked for BYU parking so maybe I'll reach out to him to ask some questions out of curiosity.",

Information is passed from BYU security (and sometimes even the honor code office etc) to the actual police. And all the police officers I know hate BYU police because they're essentially the rejects from other departments or about to retire so they get a cush position at BYU where they just give out tickets all day.",

Right of real property owner to regulate traffic. \n     Except as provided under Section 41-6a-214, this chapter does not prevent the owner of real property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel by permission of the owner and not as matter of right from:\n(1)\tprohibiting the use;\n(2)\trequiring other conditions not specified in this chapter; or\n(3)\totherwise regulating the use as preferred by the owner.\n\n\nThis is the relevant Utah code. SubSections 2 and 3 clearly do not prevent a private property owner from requiring other conditions (e.g., setting additional parking restrictions outside from or different from Provo) and 2) regulating the use (enforcement). \n\n\u201cHow\u201d they do that is also hinted at in the doc. The doc indicates that BYU adopts the Utah state traffic code and Provo ordinances as alleged \u201cstandards.\u201d  If these codes allow for ticketing or towing then a private property owner would well be within their right to require compliance and seek enforcement under the Utah code. \n\nOriginally I was under the assumption that it was a private contract between you and byu that allowed enforcement but it\u2019s actually Utah law and that makes sense because non-students get parking tickets all the time. \n\nWhether BYUs enforcement is jerking people around, that answer is yes and we know exactly how.",

    "postText": "This probably sounds like an ad, but is more of a plea for help lol. I just graduated in June and have been helping built a platform here in Utah called [The Lowdown](https://thelowdownutah.com/search) that is kind of like Rate My Professor but for housing, particularly housing that college students can rent (because finding good housing feels impossible). We are all over Utah and eventually want to have reviews nationally as well, but currently are in need of reviews Provo and Orem to make the housing search there easier!\n\nSO if you've rented a place in the last three years and you've liked it, loved it, or even hated it, we want to hear about it! Plus, if you make an account and leave a review, you're automatically entered into a giveaway for one of five $100 Amazon gift cards that we giveaway each month. Leave a review here: [https://thelowdownutah.com/location](https://thelowdownutah.com/location)",

We also want to be a sort of one-stop shop to know about amenities, save and compare locations, and list contracts to sell! These functionalities will hard launch in January!",

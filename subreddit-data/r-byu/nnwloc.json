    "postText": "The recent stuff that happened at Raintree is absurd. No company would ever try something like kicking out all residents with one day notice unless they knew BYU wasn't going to do anything about it. We signed away our rights to pursue other legal actions in favor of mediation through OCH. It clearly isn't working.\n\nThe fact is BYU is failing to hold up their end of the agreement to protect us and unintentionally created an environment that invites monopoly-like behavior. Raintree apparently isn't the first time something like this has happened according to the comment section, so there's nothing that's going to stop it from happening in the future unless we demand change.\n\nLet's discuss what would be the best way to stir change, and then let's do it.",

This could be due to failure to verify address, not living in contracted housing, or not having a current waiver that has been approved by the waiver/appeal committee. Students who do not update their residential address or who live in housing not contracted by the university and who are not excused by the BYU Off-Campus Housing Office are subject to the following sanctions:   \nNon-compliance fees up to $175.00 will be incurred, and future registration may be stopped, until the student verifies that he or she is living in or will be living in university-contracted housing.  \nStudents falsifying their addresses will be subject to the above consequences as well as disciplinary action by the university for Honor Code violations.  \nWhen a student signs an agreement to live in a facility not contracted by the university and has not been excused from the university housing requirement, these sanctions will be applied even though the student's tenancy extends beyond the current semester or term in which the student is enrolled. A student in this situation will have to either move from the uncontracted housing unit, regardless of the consequences, or forego registration and other privileges at the university until complying with this policy. \n\nSource: https://och.byu.edu/faq.html",

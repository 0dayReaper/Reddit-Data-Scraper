    "postText": "tldr/bluf: **Utah Congressman John Curtis came to the law school and said he regrets the fact that he didn't shake hands with people that raided the Capitol.** \n\nTo sum it up, John Curtis (BYU Alum) said that one regret he had with respect to the (events) at the Capitol on January 6th, 2021, was that he didn't go out to the crowd and shake hands with people. John Curtis doesn't represent BYU Law School--or even BYU or the Church for that matter--but how many of my fellow Cougars are pleased with Curtis regretting the fact that he didn't go out to shake hands with people who gathered at the Capitol on January 6th, 2021, in protest of the election results? Please, explain your reasoning.\n\nStart your response with the following script: \"I am (pleased/displeased) with John Curtis with respect to his regrets surrounding the (gathering/protest/rally/insurrection/other) on January 6th, 2021, at the US Capitol because...\"\n\nI am trying to get a feel for how students and those associated with the university feel about John Curtis's (now alleged, but hopefully someone pulls the video so those who answer don't have to rely on my hearsay) statements regarding the scuffle at the Capitol. Please, keep it civil. Also, please refrain from replying to the sincerely held opinions of others until you express your own. I'll start first.\n\n\"I am displeased with John Curtis with respect to his regrets surrounding the insurrection on January 6th, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol because it was based on an easily verifiable adjudicated lie. I thought Curtis was reasonable. Now, I think he's a populist. Provo is one of the more moderate areas of the State (especially if you include BYU's student body). Curtis's statements shocked me a little. You can hate on Mike Lee all you want, he'd never say anything like that (publicly) even though he represents a more conservative mass. It concerns me that John Curtis thought he could say these things safely at BYU. I think he's out of touch. BYU is structurally conservative. That said, outside of a few outliers, most liberals and conservatives on campus are more open-minded than you would think. I have only heard a few people express elation over the January 6th, 2021, \"events\". What sort of vibe does John Curtis think BYU students give off? Sure, some people are nuts. But most of the students are able to think their way out of a fear bubble. This is especially true of law students at BYU.\"\n\n\\--Just my opinion. Probably wrong, but I'm okay with that.",

            "comment": "I attended the speech by John Curtis today and have a very different perspective of how he feels about the insurrection. Yes, he was a little flippant when talking about the insurrection, but i dont remember him ever saying anything about wanting to shake hands with anyone there. And also he said he was angered by the presidents handling of the situation. \n\nThis was my first experience hearing from John Curtis and I thought he seemed like a good person. I do not know anything else about him but based on his speech today I would definitely not label him an insurrectionist. \n\nSo as OP and I have very different takes after listening to the same thing, I would not judge John Curtis based on this post.",

An FBI agent said that 9/11 was nothing compared to Jan 6.\n\nIt was much more civil and tame than the rioting that happened in the south and Midwest, and that behavior was endorsed by Kamala and the like.",

It's religious and age related (or lack there of) that really brings Provo down in their metrics.\n\nIf you're like many people and think mostly of racial/ ethnic diversity, when you hear the word diversity, Provo is about 71% white (US overall is about 59%). Certainly not a bastion of diversity, but not nearly the least racially diverse place in America. In fact, that puts Provo at number 213 out of the 500 cities listed in the Wallethub study. \n\nJust a general fyi for anyone else that's curious.",

There is a ton of ethnic, racial and linguistic diversity in the city, not just even from the students. Tons of central/south american immigrants, polynesian peoples, and growing populations of black and asian individuals.

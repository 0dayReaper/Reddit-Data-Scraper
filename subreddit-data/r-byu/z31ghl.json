    "postText": "Hi there! We\u2019re a group of college students working on a project to create a better reading service for adults with vision loss, dyslexia, and other disabilities that make reading difficult. If you experience difficulty reading books due to an impairment or disability, it would mean a lot to us if you\u2019d be willing to take our short 10-15 minute reading survey here. If you know someone with an impairment or disability, it would mean a lot if you could send this survey their way. Thank you!\n\n[https://forms.gle/vbVeTy9EvJCFAjWW6](https://forms.gle/vbVeTy9EvJCFAjWW6)",

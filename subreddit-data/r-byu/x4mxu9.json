My program lost basically all of our adjunct - all were excellent teachers, well respected, with multiple years of good experience here at BYU. To my knowledge, all are well within the terms of worthiness and the honor code, and each one was somewhere between centrist and conservative on the political scale. \n\nCan\u2019t find any rhyme or reason to it - head of department said it was higher than the university, and that in his appeals, he eventually hit a wall and couldn\u2019t get up the next link in the chain.",

These instructors don't have a whole lot of job security at any university.\n\nIt's also unlikely they're apostates--faculty at BYU (as all church employees) make less than going market rates to teach at BYU because they want to be there, and adjuncts are paid even less than full-time faculty.  \n\nI also doubt these are controversial \"apostates\"--adjuncts don't have clout in their departments and can't be controversial and stick around from semester to semester.  Even conservative dyed in the wool true blue faculty get frustrated with university bureaucracy and department politics and leave on their own if it gets to be too much for them.\n\nIf as another poster said their department is losing all its adjuncts, it probably has nothing to do with TR policies.",

There are PhDs from good schools teaching classes at SLCC, UVU, and BYU simultaneously and carrying larger teaching loads across multiple campuses than regular full time faculty at those schools and still make less money, with no path to full time employment or tenure.  Either that, or faculty with lesser degrees end up teaching more classes because PhDs are getting burned out and giving up on higher ed and going into private sector for higher pay.",

There is a limit to how many part/full time positions each department and college can have and it makes things pretty cut throat when a college wants to grow a program but are limited by the number of jobs they are aloud to have. If their lucky when someone retires/quits they can save a position but a lot of time they have to compete for those positions with other folks in the college. That\u2019s how it is among staff positions and likely could be the same with faculty.",

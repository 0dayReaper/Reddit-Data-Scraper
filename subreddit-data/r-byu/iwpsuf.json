He has to know most of it is wildly outdated and plenty of people would love to see it changed.\n\nThere would be no harm in changing it and only good.\n\nIt totally agree that an Honor Code is good and reasonable, especially for a church school. However, it is a school..not a religious institution. It does need to change a little with the times here and there to continue to stay well and relevant.",

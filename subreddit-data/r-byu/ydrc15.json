If you have a friend or sibling at one of those campuses, see if they will help you sign up under their information here. https://education.wsj.com/search-students/\n\nThere are a bunch of other colleges that have the free access rights too. Out of all your friends and acquaintances, I\u2019m sure you can find someone who goes to one of the schools listed. They\u2019re probably not using it themselves and can maybe help you out. \n\nI would somewhat say it could be worth it to ask one of those advising offices in the Marriott School building, too. Like one of those advising offices on the left side of the floor when you walk in from the main campus/JKB area. I don\u2019t see anything online, but the entrepreneurship office etc. have all kinds of surprises and it\u2019s not that out of the question that someone in that area might be able to help you sign up or something.",

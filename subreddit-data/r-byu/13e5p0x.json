Everyone I\u2019ve talked to all feel like this past semester has been a heavy load and dragged way too long especially with all the snow. I think more people really needed a break and left than in past years.",

I even got away with wearing knee-length shorts. (Maybe those are ok, now?  Not sure on the current dress code. I was there in the 90s.)",

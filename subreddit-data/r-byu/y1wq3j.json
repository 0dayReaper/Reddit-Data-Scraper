    "postText": "The past dress &amp; grooming standards are pretty similar to what was in the old For the Strength of the Youth. The recently revised version is a lot more vague/ambiguous especially when it comes to dress/grooming, piercings, and tattoos. Especially since Uchtdorf said \u201cI suppose the guide could give you long lists of clothes you shouldn\u2019t wear, words you shouldn\u2019t say, and movies you shouldn\u2019t watch. But would that really be helpful in a global church? Would such an approach truly prepare you for a lifetime of Christlike living?\u201d; is it likely that BYU might update their dress &amp; grooming standards in the Honor Code to be less confined/strict?",

You can see it just walking around, especially in warmer months. Eventually the admin will probably feel like they have to do something, whether its a crackdown or petitioning the brethren for a relaxation. Hopefully the latter",

In my now adult opinion, that was very wrong of BYU to expect a teenager to sign a paper that will directly and meaningfully affect the next 25%+ of their life. Regardless of what that agreement is. 17 year olds are not prepared for that kind of commitment and 17 year olds are exactly the people who believe they are prepared anyways. \n\nEvery time byu gets some fresh faced, directly out of high school, kid, to sign an agreement that will seriously affect them for years, it is byu who is doing wrong, not the kid. BYU is an organization that has been around for over a hundred years and should know better. I could make a kid sign away their life on the promise of candy. I\u2019ll give them the candy. I\u2019ll fulfill my end of the bargain. Is it the kids fault that I own them now and they essentially belong to me? It\u2019s the same problem with the military in America.\n\nEvery bishop after my first agreement got told: I struggle with it and I disagree with the policy but I will try. \n\nI try. I try until my cognitive dissonance starts peaking and then I opt for my own mental health. Then I begin my system of active disobedience. I do it not because I\u2019m laughing in the faces of those who would have obeyed but didn\u2019t get accepted, but for those who will be accepted in the future. I disobey for them. It\u2019s a stupid system with dumb rules and I will not blindly follow. Not sorry.",

That\u2019s exactly what needs to happen. What should have happened with byu and indeed the world as a whole, is small improvements over time. Just little ones over the course of decades. The problem is that either no steps or backwards steps have been made. \n\nWhen that happens, and the world keeps advancing and getting smarter, better, more rational, friction starts building. Soon enough that friction builds up and without concessions on the antiquated side, and a firm hand on the more progressed side, a break occurs. \n\nThe tension at byu has been building since probably the 90s. There\u2019s so much pushback now that these small concessions like being less authoritarian and more \u201cspirit of rebellion\u201d is not only way too late, but way too little as well. More radical moves have to be made to catch up. And I\u2019m standing firm at that line. \n\nI refuse to accept less. I\u2019m over these past generations crap. I\u2019ll have a beard if I want one. I\u2019m not a bad person for it. I\u2019m not going to apologize for it. I know what I signed when I was 17. I understand that what byu did with me and every student was immoral and continues to be immoral. I\u2019m not going to sit back and do or say nothing when I see something happening that is wrong. I may have my hand forced into shaving when I take a test because then my future is on the line and I\u2019m not going to sacrifice my future to spite byu in the short term. But every time I pick up that razor, my hand grips a bit tighter.",

As you pointed out yourself, there is a statue of the Brigham Young himself, in a central campus location, beard permanently cast in bronze. \n\nAnyone who says otherwise is directly lying to your face. They might believe the lie. I don\u2019t know nor do I care. That does not change the truth. \n\nI have NEVER. NEVER. Been convinced by anyone that the controversial honor code policies are at all worth following. I\u2019ve had so many conversations on the topic I don\u2019t care to count anymore. They always start friendly with a \u201chey bud what\u2019s up with the scruff\u201d and after I shoot down every argument they throw, from godliness to the honor of your word, to hey it\u2019s just the right thing to do, it always ends with \u201cwell you signed the paper so you have to.\u201d \n\nI end the conversation there because I don\u2019t want to become a target for the honor code. The refutation to the last statement is that an organization is morally and ethically in the wrong to force, coerce, or in some less forceful way cause a teenager to sign the rights to their own body away. Even if it is done willingly and happily by the teenager. It is still morally deplorable. As such, it may hold legal weight, but it does not hold moral weight.\n\nWhat speaks loudest to me is the order that these arguments always take, it starts out friendly and progresses to spiritual debate. When that fails, the \u201cspiritual\u201d aspect somehow always fades away in the conversation and is replaced with legal consequences. \n\nArguments typically follow a path wherein the interlocutors begin with the easiest arguments and follow them with their own personal beliefs when placed on the back foot. That is what happens in these debates. The \u201cgodly\u201d organization or student first starts with the easy \u201chey we both love god\u201d and progresses to \u201cyou signed the paper\u201d. They don\u2019t care about you or your relationship with god. If they did, they\u2019d end the conversation with god not begin it with god. They care about control and they mask it with a feigned adoration of god.",

The second he was gone the new guy brought in caffeine. I've been told by many people that the no caffeine wasn't so much a BYU decision as it was a power hungry singular person in a position of power using his power in an abusing way.  Just what I heard from several different people.",

This happened when jeans were still not allowed, in the 70s.\n\nLike many students today, students then knew you could get away with certain things as long as you didn\u2019t go to the testing center. So a woman was wearing jeans, a shirt, and a trench coat and had to go take a test. They turned her away and she really just didn\u2019t want to go all the way home to change her pants. Her trench coat was long enough to be considered modest, so she went into the bathroom and took off her jeans, so took the exam with no pants on.\n\n[Link](https://universe.byu.edu/2014/11/04/26-years-later-the-story-of-anita-welch1/)",

I did the same and it ended up being WAY more work than I thought. I would recommend going 12, maybe  14 max. College courses are going to harder than you think, and these specifically look like a lot of work. \n\nChem 105 is a lot of work. PHIL 201 and PSYCH 210 will be a lot of reading. I happen to know Daniel Becerra and his classes are usually pretty interesting, but a lot of reading and writing. \n\nJust a thought.",

It was obviously NOT worth the 1-2 extra classes I took. I recommend dropping down to &lt;=14 credits. You have several years of college ahead of you, take some time to adjust and settle in! \n\nKeeping your scholarship is much more important than squeezing in an extra class.",

Even though Dr. Ammons is a spaz (a very fun spaz, but a spaz nonetheless) and hardly the best director BYU has to offer, you're still expected to learn a lot of music very quickly. In addition to your two two-hour rehearsals every week, you'll have a sectional, and you'll have to practice at least an hour a day just to keep up with the music. If you do particularly well during auditions and make it into Synthesis, plan on closer to two hours a day of practice, because then the expectation is that you'll not only know the music, but you'll sound good playing it.\n\nMusical ensembles at BYU are listed as one credit hour, but the amount of time required for the more advanced ensembles makes them more like a three or four-credit class.",

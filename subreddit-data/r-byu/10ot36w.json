Part of applying to BYU is getting an \u201cecclesiastical endorsement.\u201d Im not sure the specifics for those outside of the LDS faith, but to my knowledge you\u2019ll essentially need a \u201cletter of recommendation\u201d from someone you consider to be a spiritual leader. If you dont attend a church formally, I think you can pick someone you would consider to be a \u201cspiritual leader\u201d to you in some capacity, although I would check on that. \n\nOtherwise, I would guess you have a good shot at getting in if your grades are good and you write some good essays. Transfers have an easier time getting in, freshman admissions to BYU are harder than a lot of people would think",

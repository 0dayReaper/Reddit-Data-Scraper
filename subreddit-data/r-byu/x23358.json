And people were using them for 30 minutes plus. Went on the treadmill most of the time. Is their a better gym that\u2019s not crowded. It\u2019s getting ridiculous \u2639\ufe0f",

I never had to wait long at all for a bench, and often they weren't even all taken. \n\nBonus if you sign up for the evening weightlifting class because then you just have the dedicated lifting time every other day and the equipment you need likely won't be used.",

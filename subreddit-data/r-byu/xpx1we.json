Back on June 16th, BYU employees got the following announcement as part of Y News:\n\n&gt; **Changes to Zoom Accounts + Storage**\n\n&gt;Starting tomorrow, the settings on BYU Zoom accounts will change the default meeting recording settings to on-demand recording instead of automatic recording. Additionally, non-employee students will only have access to basic business accounts on Zoom, which will mainly limit their ability to host Zoom meetings longer than 40 minutes.\n\n&gt;Starting October 28, 2022, cloud recordings older than six months will be automatically deleted. If you need to save recordings older than six months, you will need to move them to another storage solution, such as Box.",

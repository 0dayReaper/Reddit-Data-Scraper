    "postText": "As another person in this group talked about having a friend rejected from BYU then admitted, I also received the email and was very skeptical. However, I did end up checking it out pretty much all day yesterday and here\u2019s everything I learned:\n\nKeep in mind, at my other school I was planning to attend I had a FULL TUITION scholarship and HOUSING already secured. I only capital so it\u2019s easier to memorize.\n\n1. They are legit emails, and this RARELY happens. Everyone I talked to made me feel like I was lying (which, is part of the reason for my decision.) and there were some AWESOME people I talked to who gave great advice.\n\n2. Every single scholarship has been awarded, with no opportunity to match my offer.  (As another redditor said on the other post, it was unlikely there would be any sort of match or scholarships available anyway.) \n\n3. Housing would have been a MESS.\nMy first phone call with off campus housing went great! They were so kind and walked me through the process, but in the end, as I would be a freshman they said it would be HIGHLY unlikely to get my petition approved and not have to sell my lease and get onto the waitlist for On-Campus housing. \n\nI got another phone call telling me to just try and petition, but by then I had made my decision.\n\n4. Classes\nAs anyone who knows someone in college, or is in college you know classes fill up quick. They did confirm I would likely have the very picked over classes and end up with a lot of 8 ams. I also have lots of concurrent and AP classes to transfer so that would have been tricky to figure out in such late notice. \n\n5. My decision?\nDecline. I received an official acceptance but in the end after reviewing and careful prayer and consideration with leaders, family and friends, I declined. Yes, I know there are kids who WISHED they were in my shoes, and to anyone that is, I am very sorry that this opportunity didn\u2019t come to you. Please consider all your options and keep an open mind. I\u2019m very at peace with my decision to attend another place, and I\u2019m very happy for anyone that this worked out for and they got to attend BYU. \n\nSome secondary factors are that I have a double piercing- I already feel like a sinner at church because of what people say, and it\u2019s not a fun feeling.\n\nI felt like everyone thought I was lying-\nI understand how crazy it sounds, but everyone I talked to asked me if I was making it up. It kinda hurt. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t the place for me at the time, but there is your first hand look at late acceptance. Feel free to ask questions, but please do not leave negative comments on the reasons for my decline. I feel at peace.",

They didn\u2019t find another school because they wanted to, they found another school because they had to, and a chance like this is an answered prayer. For those kids, I am happy they have this opportunity. They would willing drop everything because it is BYU and it\u2019s where they wanted to go SO BADLY. So, maybe if my declining let\u2019s another one in like that, then I am more than happy to decline.",

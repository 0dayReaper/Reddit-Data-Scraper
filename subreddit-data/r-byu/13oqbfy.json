I don't remember the pace, but I stopped showing up to class because I found their official YouTube channel that literally teaches you all the concepts you need to know in short segments. So I didn't have to really worry about class schedule.\n\nI will say I could afford to not show up to class though because when I took it, they had the offer that if your grade on the final was better than your grade in the class, they would take your grade on the final as your class grade. So I gambled and did no assignments and just took the exams as prep (they reused exam questions on the final) and then took the final.",

            "comment": "Took it last summer term. If you've done normal high school science classes that'll definitely get you pretty far (although I had friends who didn't have a Chem req in high school and struggled there). I did the challenge exam at the start and got in the high 60s and then got around an 80 on the final (didn't prep for it]) so not sure I learned a ton but I got an A. Granted, I did go to class everyday although I didn't necessarily pay attention every day. If you're doing the homework and occasionally going in for help on harder subjects (like relativity) you should be fine. Tests aren't a massive chunk of the total grade and a 90% is an A for the class. I would argue it's designed for people to get a basic understanding, fill the req, and get an A.",

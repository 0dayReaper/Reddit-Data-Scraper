    "postText": "I just wanna rant\n\nI'm perfectly fine with having required textbooks for class, physical or digital. My issue is when quizzes and other assignments are DIRECTLY tied to the textbook. Which means, I HAVE to buy this specific version of the textbook, which can be upwards of $100, otherwise I can't do my assignments!\n\nYea there's an option to opt-out if you already have your own copy of the textbook, but if you wanna save yourself the headache from the inconvenience of talking back and forth between professor, textbook company, and school department, just pay the $100...\n\nGetting my own copy for $15 was not worth all this headache. I'm just mad that I'm basically forced to spend $100 for the exact same item simply because all of our assignments are submitted through the online textbook, with no good alternative way to do those exact same assignments non-digitally.\n\nWhy give us the option to opt-out when opting-out means we can't submit assignments??\n\nAnyone else feel this way?",

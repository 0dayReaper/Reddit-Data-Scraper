If less you will be considered a new student. \n\nhttps://enrollment2.byu.edu/transfer-guides\n\nThis is a guide to transfer class and what is evaluated. If it is not evaluated you can always email the respective department with the syllabus and they will evaluate it. This is what I did. Let me know if you have any questions about the process.\n\nChoose your school from the above link and will till what can transfer.\n\nEdit: 24 Credits are needed to be considered a transfer not 30.",

I got 24 credits and I never even took the ACT or SAT. Got into BYU with exactly 24 credits.",

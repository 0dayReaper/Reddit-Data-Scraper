    "postText": "As implied in the title of my post, I have already been accepted to BYU. However, I am worried about that changing. The only grades that I have ever gotten have been A\u2019s and B\u2019s. However, I currently have an incomplete in one of my classes. I\u2019ve been really struggling in this class, and I\u2019m worried that I might not be able to get it up, or at least not very high. Will BYU take back my admission if they see that I haven\u2019t been able to live up to past grades?",

By the time they realize that you are struggling in this class (if at all) you will already be down here taking BYU classes. Plus if you've gotten mostly good grades then they couldn't be bothered if you got a bad grade in a few others.",

And at BYU it takes a lot to get you kicked out when it comes to your grades. They will work hard with you to find solutions and to help you succeed if you are talking to your advisor and make a plan. A lot of people put BYU on a pedestal and think that they will strike the hammer down on you if you fall behind and in my case, this is NOT true. My experience with advisors and counselors at BYU has been consistently wonderful. They work hard to make sure every student has the ability to succeed and failure is in-fact an option. You do also have the ability to petition for an incomplete contract to work with your professor after the semester ends. If you do this, you must be willing to complete the contract and finish the course. If you cannot, don\u2019t make one, otherwise it\u2019s a wonderful opportunity to catch up and pass a class. The reason I would recommend not making the contract if you don\u2019t feel confident is because it will make your ability to get an incomplete contract again in the future much more difficult.",

When people see that the Y is lit up in a rainbow, many will assume that the University administration themselves did it; after all, they control when the regular lights are on at the Y.  Now, one could argue that the university is its students, but consider this\u2014what if all the people who lit the Y with rainbow flashlights were not from BYU?  Would it be different, because it would be other people appropriating a symbol which is, admittedly, probably trademarked by BYU?  Or would it be valid protest?\n\nIf BYU is truly interested in controlling the message that the Y sends, then their strongest option will be to simply block access to it.  This would also make hiking to the Y less fun, though, so hopefully it won't be needed.",

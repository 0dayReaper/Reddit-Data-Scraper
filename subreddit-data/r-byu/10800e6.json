Make sure you keep your eyes on the screen at all times (unless you're using scratch paper or a calculator), and keep your face in view of the camera. I'd also recommend making sure your desk is completely clear except for things that are directly needed for the test, and make sure you have good lighting. I've had some pretty picky proctors, and some pretty lenient proctors, so it's a roll of the dice.",

For BYU's regular semester/term online tests, they just use automated proctoring. For independent study, BYU uses live proctoring where a person sits there the entire time and watches you live.",

I'm sure they have some kind of algorithm or process to see if you're doing anything suspicious when reviewing the footage so I don't think angle matters too much, as long as they can see your face. \n\nWe used it in my gen psych class, so idk if other courses use a live proctor version. Hopefully your class does a practice run with examity so you know how it works before an actual exam",

    "postText": "My academic advisor suggested I take a religion class from BYU IS to stay on track for my target graduation date. I'm looking at a couple: RELC-333 The Living Prophets (which I've seen recommended on this subreddit before) and RELC-343 Modern Church, 1900-Present.\n\nFor RELC-343, the professor is Mary Jane Woodger. I couldn't find her BYU IS course on RateMyProfessor, but her other ratings are particularly dismal. The course has 15 open note quizzes worth 60% of the grade and a proctored final worth the remaining 40%.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this course specifically? Or if not, with similar courses where the grade is determined by so few assignments? I'd love an easy course, I'm okay with a medium one, but I don't want to get myself into an impossibly challenging beast of a religion class",

It's really forgiving with its 60% open-note weighting, plus most final questions are quiz questions (maybe a bit rephrased). Many notes for the quizzes are readily available online. Chances are you won't interact with the professor at all, so RMP scores aren't super relevant.",

Or where the questions more reasonable?",

Major trends and structural changes in the Church are at the forefront, stuff like \"where was the first stake outside the Americas?\" and \"what mission did Grant open in 1901?\", but since the quizzes are open-note &amp; the final is mostly just quiz questions, it's really not much of a nuisance. I think there might have been a couple questions here or there that were just esoteric for no good reason, but it's not that bad.",

If you have a financial hardship, make sure you write the 4th essay about your extenuating circumstances to qualify for a need-based scholarship.\n\nAlso, try applying for off-campus scholarships through [https://byu.scholarshipuniverse.com/](https://byu.scholarshipuniverse.com/)\n\nFYI, BYU has a policy that they can't award more than 200% of the *member* tuition (this only applies to BYU scholarships), so you could only get up to 100% of the non-member tuition. (There could be some exceptions made in very extenuating circumstances.)",

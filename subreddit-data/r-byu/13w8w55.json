    "postText": "I have to retake a finance class at my university. I\u2019m thinking of taking MSB 250 through independent study (which is the equivalent) and I was wondering if it was difficult to do over the summer. I only have til about august to do the course just because of my university rules with BYU. If anyone took this course let me know how it went and if it\u2019s doable in 2.5 months.",

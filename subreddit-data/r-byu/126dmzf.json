    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m a pre-business student applying to the IS program this spring. I only had 3 semesters at byu before business school applications opened so I am trying to get extra classes done before I start the program.\n\nI am currently signed up for a study abroad for spring term, but for summer term I wanted to take some classes. \n\nI am registered for an online MCom class and I\u2019m thinking about adding Econ 110 (at the salt lake center). I know this makes for a pretty brutal summer but I was wondering if anyone has advice and if this is doable? \n\nMCom, econ 110, and fin 201 are the only business generals I have left and I don\u2019t want to be trying to do the MISM and worrying about not having finished econ yet. Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "I am a current MCOM TA and I would not recommend taking it online during the summer if coupled with Econ. A summer term is such a short time span to fit all of the material into, and doing that for both classes will make for a rough term. MCOM isn't a tough class, apart from the infamous grammar exam that tends to catch a lot of students off guard with its difficulty. I would definitely recommend taking the class during a normal semester.",

If I were in your spot, I would choose MCom. That class in the summer would be a lot more manageable than Econ, in my opinion.",

Depends on the professor, and I don't know how it is through Salt Lake. If those are your only 2 classes for  Summer term I think it is super doable. I would consider it an average workload for a term. You got this!",

It\u2019s a fast paced course in a full semester, so a term would be crazy fast (and I can only assume would be difficult with any other classes). Salt Lake is a good way to take it though in the semester, I took it up there from Joseph Brignone and it still wasn\u2019t easy but from what I heard from people taking it in Provo at the same time it was quite a bit easier up there",

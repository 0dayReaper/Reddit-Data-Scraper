Is Writing 316 pretty intensive?\n\nOut of these classes, which ones you think would be the most manageable (assuming I'm gonna have a heavy load with other classes)  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bsnhugefc84b1.png?width=1532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c0d8b3b436b72dc97bf248daab8cc9cb9f5d11b4",

You will love this class, you read about 1 chapter a week with a small quiz before class sometimes you get perks like working in groups on the quiz. Just make sure you put in the work on the papers (not very many) and you will be fine.",

Lots of projects (some group assignments), but no tests.\n\nIt's not intensive, but it does require effort if you want a good grade. If you are ok with a C or a B, you could just float through the class. If you want an A, you'll have to put in a decent amount of effort",

If by \"looking at the schedule\" you mean the list of teachers in mymap registration, she could just be unassigned as of now. \"Staff\" is just a placeholder for that. It's a shot in the dark to try to get her. But from what I've heard most teachers are pretty similar for 316, at least content-wise, so I wouldn't necessarily wait to try and get her in the first place. Just consult ratemyprofessor.",

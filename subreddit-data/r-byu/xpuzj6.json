    "postText": "Wondering what you guys think of in person versus online school? I feel like I go to in person lectures to reteach myself the material so I wonder if online just makes more sense. It's fun to go in person to meet people I guess, but I rarely see the same people twice so I don't make lasting friendships going in person",

            "comment": "It really depends on how you learn? For online classes you have to really be self motivated and organized. Do you do better with a lecture, or reading a chapter and having assignments and quizzes based on that chapter? I struggle with in person classes. The motivation for me to sit in a classroom and listen to a lecture is not there. I thrive with online learning. I get to do it at my pace, when I want to do it, and not have to worry about attendance and missing information because I can\u2019t focus. I went from failing out to making the deans list. The downside to online learning is that you don\u2019t make the connections that you need for networking like you would for in person classes. Also online classes tend to be heavy in the homework department than in tests. My current classes have 100 points for homework assignments compared to the 20 points for quizzes and exams. All that to say is, depends on how you learn.",

That was because I could talk with the teacher after class easily and he was willing to talk, and because it made doing further research during class very easy. However all of that is to say I loved the class and wanted to learn more and so I did.",

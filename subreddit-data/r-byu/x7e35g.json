Each week we\u2019re making a popular regional item for the \u201cgame of the week.\u201d This week the selected game of the week is Baylor vs BYU. What\u2019s a unique tailgate food y\u2019all like to have? Doesn\u2019t have to be a smoked entree, last week we did boiled peanuts (but we smoked them) for Georgia!\n\nThanks in advance!",

Utahn's love their dish bakes. **\"Funeral Potatoes\" or \"Relief Society Potatoes\"** is one that comes to mind as showing up at almost every pot luck and tailgate I attended.\n\nEDIT: Just scrolled down and saw that funeral potatoes has been mentioned a few times. Gotta love some affirmation.",

A lot of the neighborhoods around the stadium get pretty irate about stadium goers parked there. On BYU property, including the parking lots Alcohol is prohibited. So you might be able to have a tailgate party down the street at the Walmart Parking Lot but not at the Stadium itself. As stadium parking is run by the BYU police department they're a little more stringent than typical parking cops.",

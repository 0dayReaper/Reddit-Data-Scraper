            "comment": "It is decently heavy. Lots of lengthy assignments that you have to be very precise and thoughtful in your writing. That being said, if you just want to pass with a B/B- and don\u2019t care about getting a great grade, its curved like most business school classes and you can pretty easily get a middle of the pack grade.\n\nI will say, it is an incredibly useful class and you might want to consider waiting until you can have one of the normal professors. My professor (K Newell) was one of the best professors I have had at BYU. She helped me improve my writing and communication skills in a way that was super fun and engaging. It has undoubtedly been the best non-major course I have taken at BYU.",

It's not hard to get an A, you just have to make sure you don't get behind. Again, professor Dixon is amazing and will give you opportunities if you try hard. I'd say it's 4/5 in difficulty just because of the assignments.",

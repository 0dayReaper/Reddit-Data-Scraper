Once I think I wore leggings though and stuffed some jeans in my backpack on the way out in case I had to change. (No one commented so I didn't.)\n\nThe one thing people DO stare at is if you don't wear a bra. I sometimes used to go braless due to pretty bad sensory processing issues and chronic pain, and older people at BYU (like professors) would stare and look uncomfortable, especially this one female professor who stared at the beginning of every conversation. It was interesting because male professors tended to completely ignore my chest, while female professors would stare like I'd sprouted a third boob. However, I still never got dress-coded no matter how tight or loose my shirt was. I just suck it up and wear a bra now though because I don't like the awkward staring.\n\nEdit: I wish I could give advice on things like short shorts and sweats but I haven't worn them on campus. I doubt you'd have problems with sweats though. Short shorts--not sure whether anyone would comment, but maybe. (It would probably be less likely if they were athletic shorts since it would look like you just had a gym class that day.) On a related note, I once overheard some BYU girls saying that if an LDS guy you're not interested in is chasing you, you can just wear short shorts sometimes and they'll stop lol. I have so many thoughts about that but don't get me started.",

Leggings alone are not acceptable attire for the classroom or in general areas of campus including in class, in the testing center, dining area, or library.*\n\n&gt;*Worn alone, leggings are permitted to be worn during the time of exercise or sports activities.*\n\nEdit: I didn't realize the link provided was a clarification made for BYU Hawaii, but its pretty obvious it all stems from 'form-fitting'.",

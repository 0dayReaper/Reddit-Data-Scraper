Have you gotten the specific permissions to, or do you just do it? \n\nI have a license, and carry most places. I want to be able to carry everywhere, including campus if I can. I just wanna know how I\u2019d be able to do that, and if there are any other ways besides getting the written consent, considering it\u2019s a right, not a permission.\n\nWhat would be the punishment for getting caught while concealed carrying?",

If you don\u2019t leave they can trespass you. \n\nThe law doesn\u2019t even say private property it says \u201cprivate residences\u201d \n\nIf byu didn\u2019t have church meetings in most all buildings they wouldn\u2019t be able to actually ban it. \n\nJust ask you to leave if you were caught. \n\nThat said byu can say they\u2019ll expel you for carrying and they can 100% do that. Which is the larger fear here.",

That's not a big deal at the movie theater, but at BYU it may mean the end of your enrollment at the school.  \n\n\nAdditionally, it is illegal to carry concealed without permission in a \"house of worship\" where notice has been given that it's prohibited. Does that mean it'll be illegal to carry concealed in the JFB because they hold church services there? Maybe it only counts on Sundays?",

That could lead to criminal charges if there was an incident that a concealed gun was involved with beyond just being discovered.\n\nThe housing rule becomes an interesting one as well because according to the code for living in approved housing you have to have permission from everyone living in the apartment and the apartment management to keep weapons there. If you've moved into non-byu housing you don't have the same rules though you Landlord can impose some restrictions.\n\nAs to the right you are correct it is a right that the United States Government and the State of Utah cannot inhibit your right to keep and bear arms but any private institution, business, property or residence has the right to prohibit the bearing of arms. So you could conceal care at UVU or the UofU but not BYU.\n\nIn general written exemptions have been made for departments like Plant and Wildlife Sciences because they sometimes have to hunt or use tranquilizer guns as part of their scientific research.\n\nIn the case of feeling the need to be armed on campus it may be worth considering taking some self defense classes or learning from one of the self defense clubs on campus that way even without a gun you can feel protected.  \n\n\nI am not a lawyer but you can always check with a Lawyer for better information and you could even talk to find one for free here.

I can't speak to the consequences of getting caught, but consider the situation in which some extreme anti-gun person happens to notice the firearm on your person or in your backpack. Or even someone who doesn't know you and gets a weird feeling/paranoid thought. What are they gonna do?\n\nThere's a considerable chance they will raise the alarm about a man with a gun on campus. In this climate of school shootings, it will trigger a massive response. When you are fingered as the suspect, not only will you be arrested and charged with probably a number of crimes, there's a good chance you will face academic expulsion for being the cause of a campus lockdown. Possibly financial penalties for the waste of public resources (first responders).\n\nI'm pro 2A, but I wouldn't carry on a college campus without explicit permission because the odds of facing legal/academic consequences are astronomically higher than the odds of your concealed firearm being used in self defense.",

I give props to OP for checking beforehand, and I hope they verify it with BYU police as well. As for those who fall under the LGBTQ category, it's totally fine if they have a desire to hold hands or whatever, but (and this applies to every person regardless of who they are) they signed a contract which they should uphold on their end.  If that means withholding from their desires, then so be it. \n\nThe same applies to covenants. There are plenty of things I'd absolutely love to do or try, but because I swore I wouldn't, I don't. Not gonna lie, sometimes I slip up and so I try and be understanding when others slip up on their promises as well. I get it, it happens, but I think the most important thing is we don't act directly in opposition or rebellion to our contractual obligations (unless those contracts are morally wrong or endanger the lives of others). \n\nNot gonna lie, I don't fully understand the feelings of someone attending BYU who is LGBTQ or someone who feels endangered enough to want to carry on campus, but I do know what it's like to feel targeted (discriminated? Not sure what word to use here) by the honor code. I won the genetic lottery of having to shave twice a day and I hate it. I get a five o'clock shadow at noon and so, if I have to take an exam, I usually have to go home, shave, and then come back onto campus. Would it be easier to just say screw it and not shave until I get in trouble? Absolutely! But because I committed to live by the honor code, I shave every day (except on the weekends; a little rebellion is healthy imo\ud83d\ude09).\n\nAnyways, that was my little ted-talk of thoughts for the day and I had to get it written out. I would erase this comment since I'm now satisfied but I'm too lazy so I guess I'll post it... Kudos if you read all the way to here, lol.",

Personally, I think there are way too many cross-currents in the lives of 18 year old members of the church to be particularly angry at them for wanting to be in a romantic relationship during their time in college. I can't imagine there are too many people in the country who don't decide that they want to be in a romantic relationship at some point from 18-25, even if they didn't realize they'd want to at 18.\n\nAlso, while it is cool to give props to OP for checking beforehand, he literally asked about the punishment for breaking the rules so my guess is that their intentions aren't to follow the rules if those rules prevent them from exercising what they believe to be a right.",

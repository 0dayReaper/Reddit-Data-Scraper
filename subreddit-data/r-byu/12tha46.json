The hours fly by fast and they pay decently, and you usually get free food. It\u2019s also right next door to Heritage Halls, so real nice to walk over. \n\nAs for Heritage Halls- they already have a table and chairs and a couch for the main room, but coordinate with future roommates about a TV and/or projector and a wifi router. Bean bags are always a huge hit. For your personal room, get a shoe rack!",

They also have a team of peer mentors who provide general academic support for BYU online high school students.

Next easiest was working for cougar cafe at the cougar eat. I only worked 6 hours a week there doing the early morning prep",

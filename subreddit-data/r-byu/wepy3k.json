I would convert the prereq classes into a business minor, so what major would go well with that outside of the business school?",

The degree seemed to be split between people that loved economics and people that didn\u2019t get into the business school and had no idea what else to do. \n\nIt was also split into people treating it like a normal 4 year degree and only taking 2ish Econ classes per semester since they\u2019re so hard, and people trying to graduate ASAP taking mad credit hours. \ud83d\ude4f to those guys for helping with the curve. I only took a couple of classes per semester and got a couple of minors.",

It's basically a business degree with a some computer science, statistics, IT, and finance mixed in.\n\nAlso, statistics with a data science emphasis would be handy.",

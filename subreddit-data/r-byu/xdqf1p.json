    "postText": "I feel like the general premise that BYU is to be different from other universities is a valid argument to make, but that argument loses its validity for me when we begin categorizing anything contrary to our own political views as the \"worldly ideology\" that BYU is allegedly adopting and, according to leaders, consequently destroying itself with.\n\nSelect leaders of the Church (oddly enough, the ones who have served as presidents of the university in the past) seem very concerned with the trajectory of BYU, and I can't really seem to understand why. Elder Holland's speech to the faculty of BYU last year seemed to trigger this culture of concern, and it seems to have stuck around pretty strongly since. I feel like BYU is simply just shifting the way we build our communities and treat and understand marginalized groups. Certainly there are students at BYU who are antagonistic toward the Church in general, but they seem to be a very vocal minority--I feel like the majority of students who are hurt by these kinds of teachings are not these, but are those who love the Church and the gospel but are navigating how to be more open-minded toward different viewpoints, perspectives, and backgrounds. Speeches like President Oaks' feel a bit divisive to me because it conveys this idea that we all have to think the same, act the same, look the same, and be essentially a monolith structured by Church leaders, and I simply don't agree with that notion. I also feel like that black-and-white approach is harmful and more faith-destructing than faith-promoting, because it teaches people that if they have doubts, questions, or concerns, that they should just leave BYU/the Church instead of wrestling with them and seeking to gain \"further light and knowledge.\" In my opinion, some of the fence-sitters in the Church are genuinely good people just seeking to build a testimony on truth rather than tradition and they are having a hard time because leaders are rushing them in their process of receiving answers to their desperate questions and prayers. It's doing more harm than good, in my opinion.\n\nI wasn't seeking to be offended by the devotional, and I don't feel that I was, just trying to grapple with why this topic felt \"priority\" and the point President Oaks was really trying to make. I don't see the \"destruction\" of BYU's uniqueness as a priority in my book when there are members of the Church literally killing themselves because they feel like they don't belong in their wards, communities, college campuses, etc. I just came away from this feeling like there is an imbalance in priorities among a few of the leaders. I think they're doing their best to tackle difficult subjects in today's world, but sometimes the execution just doesn't resonate with me. I'd love to hear what you guys thought--I'm curious to see if anyone felt similarly, or if anyone interpreted this speech differently.",

            "comment": "I'm a former BYU student (undergrad and masters) who came to grips with my honest agnostic atheism while at BYU (and on my mission).\n\nI have a lot of warm feelings towards BYU, honestly. BYU's focus on undergrad education is exemplary. I am at another university now which is *not* as focused on undergrad education, and it shows. I always had (with few exceptions) great professors, who have affected my life for the better.\n\nWhile I struggle with seeing BYU push to make the university more \"orthodox\", I think the church is perfectly within its rights to do so. Within the orthodox framework, it seems to make sense. If the LDS church really does hold the \"keys of salvation\", and if it is fully incumbent on church members to be *maximally* devoted to the church, then making BYU be more deeply orthodox and church-focused is sensible. If it is true that there are adversarial/wordly forces that are trying to bring people in the church down, then policing boundaries between the secular and the spiritual seems to be the only option.\n\nMy grief, then, is because I *don't* think the LDS Church (or anyone) holds keys to salvation, and I don't think there is an adversary who is looking to drag people into misery. I think the world just... is. There are \"worldly\" things that I think *are* harmful, and worth pushing back against. But, I don't share the LDS theological framework for justifying these beliefs.\n\nPerhaps more centrally: I think I was a *good* member of the BYU community, even while I was privately planning on stepping away from the church. I gave liberally of my time and talents to help math students learn and grow. I was a friend to those in need. I was not perfect, by any stretch. But, I feel like I could still fit in by just doing my part to help others, even though my religious beliefs were different. It makes me sad to see BYU move in a direction that would have made it less likely (or impossible) for me to be a member of the community and also honest about my beliefs. I don't feel like my contributions to the BYU community were thwarted by my personal non-belief. If anything, that only lead me to re-focus my attention on the meaningful things I still share with LDS church members.",

I think orthodoxy is a fair expectation to have of students who are going to school at BYU off the backs of tithe-paying members around the world. I guess I just wonder why I\u2019m seeing increasing rhetoric (not just at BYU, but in the Church as well) that sells the identity of queer people and the effort to love them as a \u201cworldly philosophy\u201d when it conclusively is not. There may be aspects of the idea of \u201cpride\u201d and the LGBTQ+ community that may be somewhat antithetical to the gospel, but I would say that\u2019s more in the cultural aspects rather than the identities of queer people overall. I honestly believe trying to be a disciple of Jesus Christ requires members to love, serve, and create space for queer people in the Church. \n\nI\u2019m not in favor of BYU losing its unique religious environment\u2014it should maintain it and defend it, especially if everything we do at BYU is subsidized by sacred tithing funds. I just don\u2019t think the approach leaders are taking right now to maintain that religious environment is working for me and several other students I\u2019ve talked to. They are coming down too hard on students who are making an honest effort to understand their beliefs better, and they are using rhetoric that is way too easily misconstrued as a condoning of harmful and bigoted ideologies.",

Engage with the world. And if someone has doubts or active concerns, give them space. I want to believe that a doctrine that has been well-loved and whose meaning has been fleshed out in a variety of applications, will last longer than one that exists by fiat. Oaks has invested much of his adult life on this issue, and what happens when he passes on? The church has not created a space for members to explore this doctrine and make it their own. They accept it by proxy, as just part of \"sustaining your leaders.\"\n\nMy problem with BYU is that it lumps believing with behaving: you are only welcome at the school if you not only attend church, but believe in it. Share doubts about Joseph Smith, historicity of the BoM, or modern-day policies and you are no longer able to attend or work at BYU, because you can't answer the temple recommend questions. Where else would you go to work out these doubts, if not to your pastoral counselors!?",

I feel very sad to see BYU fully pull closed a door that seemed to me to be cracked open (that is, openness to non-believing perspectives). I don't like what things like this imply about the future of LDS practice.\n\nI've raised this thought experiment before: what would be *wrong* about having a professor/staff member/student at BYU who is privately married to someone of the same sex, if they never spoke of it on campus? The answer I've seen given is that such a person would lack \"the spirit\", and thus they would be harming the environment at BYU by simply existing there.\n\nSince I don't believe in \"the spirit\", I obviously disagree with this idea. But it also just makes me sad to think of a world in which people are carrying around a metaphysical \"Good or Bad Vibes\" energy with them, and that people who are sinful simply bring bad vibes with them. I don't think all LDS people believe this, but it appears to be used as justification for zero-tolerance policies towards people who commit specific \"sins\" that the LDS church designates as serious: queer relationships, non-belief in LDS truth claims, etc.",

            "comment": "I'm a day late to responding to this so I don't know how much this will be seen, but the talk itself about how BYU needs to stand up for what it believes is right is good; any institution should do that.\n\nMy problem is the fact that they choose to remain so abstract and almost refuse to say what they are for or against. This leads to a lot of confusion and reasons for why the Office of Inclusion exists now. Oaks went into the why and the how, but skimmed over the what, and that makes me worried about what might be cracked down on next.\n\nIf you need to know my bias, I am a queer student who's just trying to find a place in the church or if I even have a place in the church and it's devotionals/talks like these that make that question so much more difficult.\n\nWe have the office of inclusion and other areas of this campus that say that stuff like same sex attraction is okay as long as it isn't acted upon (though even then there's nuance to that, the Office of Inclusion is okay with people dating in that form of a relationship or transitioning, whereas the honor code office will expel people for dating like that) but then there are devotionals like this that rely on words from the past, specifically 1976, where what was accepted is completely different from today. The What of the situation is too broad, because if we try to rely on stuff from 1976, that means no caffeine of any kind, not allowing LGBTQ people onto campus, and this was before the priesthood ban was lifted so even going into severely limiting those who would have fallen under that priesthood ban.\n\nYes I know Oaks didn't mean any of that, or at least I'd hope that wasn't what he meant, but that does leave so many other interpretations thereof. There's too much that's implied and never explicitly stated.\n\nAnd I feel like I'd get this comment, yes I would've followed anything that he gave as something to ban here at school. If I agree or not is a moot point, but I would follow it either way while attending this school.",

He's doubling down on the musket fire talk - telling the world BYU doesn't care if it incurs penalties for its policy stance, and attempting to reframe the argument about who actually \"loves\" the LGBTQ community.\n\nYes, he tried to give encouragement to the student body - \"no, your BYU degree won't be a career liability\" - but I think he's directing this more at faculty who are still sorting out their doubts over the church's policies toward marriage equality, and who have now had to waive their right to confidentiality in ecclesiastical interviews. It's little encouragement if you've foregone other career opportunities to put BYU on your resume, only to find BYU doesn't consider you orthodox enough to keep around.\n\nIn his view, those who disagree with church policies on marriage equality out of empathy for family and friends (even if they are professionally-qualified to have good insights on these issues,) are actually damning them by obstructing their compliance with what Oaks sees is a mandatory requirement for salvation. He's been writing legal briefs on this since the 70's, but as chief apostle, now he has a gauntlet to lay down.",

He isn't asking that people be or act the same, nor is he implying that BYU should have a universal political view point.\n\nI think he is urging students to leave political and or ideological differences aside and love first. Is BYU a university of activists or is it a university of children of God. I have no problem with people who do both, but maybe one is more important and unifying. \n\nI also worry about BYU's trajectory. It seems some want to secularize the school while also retaining the Church sponsorship, which seems contradictory. I may get downvoted to oblivion for saying this, but I think BYU should remain religious and the students should put Christ-like love for each other before political activism. Because religion doesn't address politics the same way politics doesn't address religion. (For those of you who disagree just know that the apostles are all over the political spectrum)",

My problem is, the interpretation of what \"Christ-like love\" actually is and looks like in action seems to differ depending on who you talk to.\n\nI've had experiences with students at BYU who feel they are an authority in telling queer people that their identity is sinful--and they perceive that as Christ-like love because they think they are \"enlightening\" the queer person they are telling that to.\n\nThe reality is, queer people already know how the Church feels and teaches about same-sex behavior, marriages, etc. They don't need someone telling them their identity is sinful. They need a community that will allow them to navigate the challenging divide between their faith and their identity, and some students at BYU seem to want to prioritize being \"right\" and teaching \"doctrine\" over simply loving people and being a source of support as they figure out their own challenges and pathway. I think the latter is a far better presentation of Christ-like love, but that's just my take.",

I also think that there's naturally going to be diversity in the Church/Kingdom of God, so we should build Zion by finding unity in the diversity rather than seeking to erase the diversity altogether.",

It takes all sorts to make a world; or a church. This may be even truer of a church. If grace perfects nature it must expand all our natures into the full richness of the diversity which God intended when He made them, and heaven will display far more variety than hell. 'One fold' doesn't mean 'one pool.' Cultivated roses and daffodils are no more alike than wild roses and daffodils. What pleased me most about a Greek Orthodox mass I once attended was that there seemed to be no prescribed behaviour for the congregation. Some stood, some knelt, some sat, some walked; one crawled about the floor like a caterpillar. And the beauty of it was that nobody took the slightest notice of what anyone else was doing. I wish we Anglicans would follow their example. One meets people who are perturbed because someone in the next pew does, or does not, cross himself. They oughtn't even to have seen, let alone censured. 'Who art thou that judgest Another's servant?'\"",

Sure, BYU does do a decent job at trying to find a balance, at least on a teaching level. I\u2019ve definitely had professors do a fantastic job at it. At an institution level, however, it\u2019s a lot more tricky. \n\nFor example, imagine having a creationist stance (which the church obviously does), but then having to turn around and teach evolution, archaeology, and geology from a scientific perspective. Without considerable nuance, this is near impossible with our current doctrinal understanding. Then beyond that, having BYU professors contributing to science in a way that is very contradictory to church doctrine to remain academically competitive.\n\nFurther, consider BYU\u2019s religion department vs other religion departments at major research institutions. At other institutions, religion and theology are all taught from a historical, linguistics, classics, sociological, philosophical, or anthropological perspective, which inherently do not rely on a belief system to be academically sound. BYU however - outside of their ancient scripture departments - overwhelming teaches religion from a belief perspective. Which does not fit in academia. And outside of Steven Harper, Eric Huntsman, and a few others, BYU religion professors are hilariously unqualified to be in their positions. Which again, is academically problematic. And that\u2019s where Elder Oaks\u2019s comments get hazy. You can\u2019t be churning out fluff based on a religious belief - and a very niche one at a macro level - and still be expected to remain academically relevant.\n\nEdit: wrote Hank Smith in error. He is also unqualified. Freudian slip I guess.",

I'm actually very picky about who I take religion classes from for that reason--I do love that BYU religion classes are faith-promoting to an extent, but I also refuse to take classes from the professors you mentioned above because it lacks so much religious scholarship that I am seeking if I'm going to PAY MONEY for a college-level religion course. I've kind of made a general rule for myself to not take religion classes from the \"superstars\" and only take from professors who actually have an accomplished graduate degree in religion or a religion-related field.\n\nI've taken classes from professors like Rutherford, Strathearn, Esplin, Becerra, Haws, etc. that were faith-promoting AND contained a great deal of honest religious scholarship; I loved those classes. I didn't feel they were unqualified to teach in that capacity at all, and I also feel like they made space in their classroom for students to challenge common notions in the Church without fearing condemnation. Guess it depends on the professors you pick.  \n\n\n\\*\\*Edit\\*\\* I also think the Church's somewhat recent shift in hiring priority (valuing CES experience over religious scholarship) was a massive step backward. It flooded the religion department with seminary teacher prototypes and that's frustrating to know that we can essentially take a college-level religion class from someone who isn't even qualified to teach it.",

How can you have such a well-qualified professor who is capable and qualified, then throw in another guy because he was popular with the youth in the 2000\u2019s?

There are leaders of the Church that have spoken vocally and strongly against evolution as a concept (*cough* McKonkie *cough*), but there are also leaders who have argued in its favor, like Talmage. Insofar as I know - and it's been a few years since I looked - the Church has no current condemnations of evolution, leaving room for members to believe in everything from hard-line creationism - like a former friend of mine - to some variant of intelligent design, to believing that the creation accounts are largely allegorical. There's room for solid scholarship at every stage except the fundamentalist hard-line, and the biology and anthropology professors I've talked to do a good job of it.\n\nThere's definitely a lot of unnecessary tension, and cases of professors getting fired or excommunicated for teaching things that are academically sound but against current Church orthodoxy, but I don't think the school has to compromise nearly as hard as a school like Notre Dame to remain academically relevant.\n\nI'm not in the administration or on the board of Trustees, though, and it seems like some folks up there strongly disagree with my thesis, so...",

I agree that science and religion are not inherently contradictory, but there are certainly circumstances that they are.\n\nTo be honest, I think BYU is going to have to eventually go the way of Notre Dame not because of academic reasons, but discriminatory. BYU and Liberty - probably the two major universities still governed and run as religious institutions of higher learning - have both received massive pushback and flak over some of their student and employee policies lately. \n\nAnd I think BYU has already started the process of majorly revising the Honor Code. They took out the LGBTQ clause (with all of that drama) to skirt discrimination laws, but still for some reason enforce it. They took out the housing standards for anyone who isn\u2019t a freshman. They\u2019re becoming increasingly lax on the dress and grooming. Don\u2019t get me wrong, these are good changes, but I think it\u2019s evidence that BYU has seen the writing on the wall.

This embrace of science was a significant part of Joseph Smith's and Brigham Young's teachings, but it's one that's kinda been subsumed as the Church increasingly adopted broader American Christian values during the 20th century.\n\nBasically, the Church is theologically equipped to be as progressive as its revelation allows. You're right that my point is kinda moot, though, as most to all of the people making these decisions are more interested in retrenchment than reconciliation.\n\nRe: the mentioned changes - my sense and observation is that there's a real tension between the boots-on-the-ground, the faculty, staff, and lower-level admins who want the school to flourish academically and the students to feel safe and accepted, and the higher-ups, the higher administration, powerful donors, and Board of Trustees whose vision of the school is as the archetypal \"Lord's University\", with a loosely-defined special calling that takes priority over everything else. My understanding is that this dissonance is the culprit behind the 2020 Honor Code bait and switch, as well as a number of other incidents and near-misses.",

That was one of the primary reasons I decided to go to BYU, so that\u2019s an interesting theory if you feel that way. I think the problem is our generation generally hasn\u2019t been taught the gospel in a way that encourages critical thinking and actually developing your own testimony; to me, I feel like there\u2019s this massive divide between somewhat naive young people who were born and raised in the Church and have never once questioned anything because they think questioning and challenging is sinful, and young people who have had to actually live in the gray (like myself) because they have experiences or identities that are somewhat at odds with Church doctrines and policies. \n\nIt makes me sad that the threat of being expelled is looming over the heads of students with genuinely painful doubts and questions about the gospel. I feel like BYU should be the perfect place for them to find answers to those questions rather than the place where they\u2019re too scared to admit this out of fear of upsetting administration and leaders. I would consider that somewhat of another institutional failure on the part of the university and the Church.",

I would say probably half the students who graduated from my degree have also left. I did study English and it does seem (to me) that humanities degrees have a higher percentage of people who leave. And I would say that many of the people I know well when I was at BYU you could tell didn\u2019t have strong testimonies or desires to stay in the Church. It is interesting because many of my English classes brought some of my most spiritual moments at BYU. As a huge BYU fan, I will admit that it bothers me to see so many people who I went to school with hate on BYU constantly.

Watching MoTab sing at Trump's inauguration definitely put some weight on my shelf.

Whether or not that\u2019s due to them being \u201cradicalized\u201d in BYU classrooms or due to the fact that there is a growing culture of members who are trying to push them out is a different story. Honestly, a lot of people I know and love who have left the Church did so because they either 1. Didn\u2019t feel like they belonged, or 2. Disagreed with the way Church leaders were approaching doctrines and policies in modern times. \n\nUnflattering church history, doubts about the authenticity of The Book of Mormon, or questions about certain doctrines and policies are things I can (and have) worked through. The feeling that you don\u2019t belong, though? That is crushing, and that feeling for me and tons of other young people seems to be a common problem due to the shift in our culture becoming more divisive and frankly cruel. If you\u2019re already having doubts and questions about your testimony, and the community that is supposed to be a helpful resource is treating you poorly for having those doubts and questions, your desire to leave is only going to grow. Sadly, I feel like the Church\u2019s efforts to maintain a faithful environment at BYU often do more harm than good in fulfilling that goal. \n\nAnd yes, I agree. The constant BYU hate is honestly tiring. So many different groups hate it for so many different reasons, and very few seem to want to have productive conversations about it.

I've overall loved studying at BYU, and have loved the religion classes and so many of the incredible bonds I've made. Talks like today make me take a step back and think a lot, though. It can be exhausting.",

I think they are teaching\u2014very objectively, too\u2014theories that are in opposition to your interpretation of what the gospel is, and so you perceive them as wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing. My major is in the college of Humanities, and while I\u2019ve taken classes that have explored Marxism, gender identity theories, moral relativism, racial essentialism, and transgender theories, these lectures were not taught at all with the intent of forcing an agenda or radicalizing students. Professors are required by their own academic integrity to present the information that modern scholarly works and research have proven and supported. If that leads to students changing their views or shifting in their perspectives, then that is on the agency of the student, not the professor\u2014and painting that as a bad thing feels rather close-minded to me. \n\nIn fact, the overall notion that BYU is going woke feels ridiculous to me because the university is one of the only institutions of higher education in the nation that has such a high volume of conservative-minded students and professors. Just because the ENTIRE campus community at BYU isn\u2019t conservative does not mean that the university is antithetical to the gospel or \u201cgoing woke.\u201d In fact, I think BYU and the Church need to make space for liberal and progressive students and professors to explore their own ideologies and interpretations of the gospel without demonizing them as apostates and threats to Church doctrine. Taking that approach is divisive and will only lead to a greater fall out of young people staying active in the Church and feeling like they belong in our community. \n\nAlso, tenets of liberation theology are strongly supported by the majority of Jesus Christ\u2019s teachings in both the Bible and The Book of Mormon. I\u2019m confused why you take issue with that. Jesus Christ Himself and scriptural prophets and apostles alike condemned people all the time for not assisting the poor and marginalized among them. It\u2019s stated in scripture that Zion is a place where there are \u201cno poor among [us].\u201d You may disagree with how people approach fulfilling that invitation, but the doctrine is there pretty clearly.",

It goes to the very foundations of the Gospel where God said that it is \"\\[His\\] work and \\[His\\] glory, to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\" Eternal Life has a specific definition in the church: Exaltation in Eternal Families.\n\nThe Family is the also the doctrine that conflicts most starkly with \"worldly ideology\", and it is this same anti-family ideology that (I think rightly) concerns the Brethren with its widespread acceptance among young adult members of the church. It's not a matter of political views, it's the most important fight for souls of this generation, a war that prophets have explicitly revealed to us is waged by Satan himself. \n\nThe issue is especially egregious within the halls of BYU, where Satan has gotten so many people to be so afraid of standing up for the doctrine of the Family for fear of offending someone that portions of a Church-sponsored place that should be training young adults up as gospel leaders in their communities are instead leading people astray to fight *against* the doctrine of the Family. \n\nNone of that is to say that we should not treat people with love and kindness. But acceptance and love for a person must never be conflated with acceptance and condoning of their sins. Some people struggle with alcoholism; we love them, but do not condone drinking. Some people struggle with pornography; we love them, but do not condone sexual immorality. Some people struggle with their temper; we love them, but do not condone violence. And some people are queer; we love them, but do not condone the portions of the queer lifestyle that are contrary to the gospel.",

You\u2019re asking an alcoholic to give up alcohol, but your asking a queer person to shut off part of their identity for ever, never date, never marry, never have a family. You said yourself that a family is the important thing to God and the church, but you would ask someone to never experience familial love? That\u2019s just my opinion though, and there\u2019s more I could say, but I\u2019d love to hear what you or others have to say. Am I right in thinking that being gay and wanting a family isn\u2019t wrong?",

I\u2019m not so convinced the \u201cLord\u201d is asking that of people, and your empathy feels empty if you think you have the authority to tell queer people they\u2019ll be happier giving up a significant portion of their identity to stay in a church whose members will only love them if they live in a certain way that those members agree and are comfortable with. The \u201ctrial\u201d they go through isn\u2019t due to their sexuality or gender identity; it\u2019s the way members treat them and the way members act as if they know everything there is to know about that doctrine, when there\u2019s so much that\u2019s really quite nebulous on the subject. Elder Holland even admitted that last year when he said he was looking forward to the day where we would \u201cmake war no more\u201d on the subject; even the brethren seem to not have a definitive answer for this issue.

Love the imperfect person, but don\u2019t condone sinful behavior.\n\nAnd yeah, no one is arguing that being queer doesn\u2019t suck. Whether that\u2019s because of social stigma or because of the understanding that they will most likely never have a romantic partner in mortality while still maintaining their good standing in the gospel. But that struggle is hardly unique or new. There are millions upon millions of people who have lived and died without finding love in this life. Many of them also chose to keep the law of Chastity because it was the right thing to do. Yes, it is lonely. Yes, it is hard. But it is still worth it. Especially because we have been promised by the Lord that we will eventually receive all the blessings we lived worthy of but were unable to obtain in mortality, up to and including eternal marriage. No more is expected of queer people than was expected of all those other righteous people who did not marry in mortality: do your best, keep the commandments, and trust that God will take care of the rest.",

God has defined marriage as being between a man and a woman, and anything else doesn't fit the definition. Other people can call other things marriage if they want to, but they should not expect me to follow suit.\n\nOn a policy level, the government needs to get out of the marriage business and settle into the civil union business. For practical purposes the government often needs to recognize the combination of 2 or more people's assets into a single entity. If two men or two women want to legally combine their assets then they are welcome to do so, the government should not stop them from doing that so long as they are of the age of majority. And the people engaging in that combination can call it marriage if they want to, it's a free country. But again, I would not consider it a marriage and any attempt to force me to consider it a marriage would be an infringement of freedom of conscience.",

Even in polygamy, there are entirely separate ceremonies between the same man and multiple wives, so I think it would be fair to say that they are separate marriages. As for why it\u2019s doctrinally possible for a man to be engaged in multiple marriages and not a woman (even if it\u2019s normally prohibited)? Honestly not sure; I have some guesses that it has to do with the role of the Priesthood and/or a practical issue of men and women not being in a 1:1 ratio in the Celestial Kingdom, but they\u2019re just that: guesses.\n\nIn any case, I think people should be allowed to combine their assets in any combination they want to, whether that\u2019s 1 guy and 4 women or 4 guys and 1 woman. They can even call it a marriage, even though I would not (barring a new authorization of Polygamy, but I doubt that will happen).",

            "comment": "Based on his words, and Elder Holland\u2019s, it sounds to me like a two-fold worry:\n\n1 - Worry that the teachers and students are beginning to shift beyond simply loving and supporting marginlized groups, to defending or even promoting sinful behavior. This is indeed happening, especially in regards to marriage and gender.\n\n2 - Worry that, in the near future, BYU will be under very aggressive and openly inflammatory attacks by various activist groups and political powers, either by false accusations, or by attacks on Christ's doctrine. This is also already beginning to happen. See recent events.\n\nAsking students and faculty to put God and His commandments first, and to be willing to go against the world when the time comes, is a very reasonable message for addressing those issues.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that everyone has to think and be the same, but that everyone should be willing to commit to God above all else when the situation arises where such a decision needs made, which is happening more and more often these days.",

As far as the church is concerned, there *is* only one right way to act, one right way to look, one right way to think.",

Most members I talk to nowadays are not buying into the idea that we must all be the exact same in order to be a covenant people. The Church is nothing without its members and followers. I think leadership is pushing that messaging hard right now as a way to remedy the growing issue of divisions within the Church; do I think that\u2019s a good method to accomplish that goal? No, not at all. In fact, I think it\u2019s creating further and deeper divisions. But I don\u2019t think the Church is doing so out of a desire to control people\u2014I think the brethren are trying and failing to remedy a division problem in the Church. I\u2019m hoping they realize soon that this \u201cone size fits all\u201d messaging approach is damaging and hurtful.",

To clarify, when I say \"the church\", I'm referring to it as it is legally organized: a corporation sole, owned by the president of the church. \"The church\" is the leadership, not the members, in the same way \"Walmart\" is the corporation, not the customers. The church would be nothing without its members, just like walmart would be nothing without its customers, but that doesn't mean that the members/customers are its priority or guide its decision-making any more than it is forced to simply to retain them.\n\n&gt;But I don\u2019t think the Church is doing so out of a desire to control people\n\nAnd this is where we disagree. IMO controlling people is the *only* reason the church exists. Whether from a believing or non-believing perspective, the church exists to tell *the members* how *they* should act, not the other way around. It is a top-down organization because any other structure would undermine its whole purpose, whether you think that purpose is \"helping people get into the celestial kingdom\" or \"making fat stacks and influencing politics\".",

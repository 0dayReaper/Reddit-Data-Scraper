    "postText": "This is my only class away from getting my business minor but after looking into all the options you have to choose from it all looks very intimidating. I did very well in the rest of my classes for my business minor but I'm not sure if they prepared me to do what these companies are asking for? Can somebody who finished their business minor explain what this class was like and how it went for them?",

            "comment": "Hey History major and business minor who just graduated and took that exact class this past semester and honestly you have nothing to worry about. The class seems intimidating at first but I worked two jobs and took classes and still had time for the class. Nothing about the class is really hard but takes time. It\u2019s a class with great opportunity to make connections with important companies like qualtrics or other nationally listed companies. You do work for the company which usually isn\u2019t too crazy and then busy work for the class. I thought the class could have been structured better but unfortunately as you know there\u2019s no way around taking the class. So take it. Bite the bullet and make the best of it. It\u2019s easy to get an A if you just show up and kinda put in effort.",

Most of the people doing that class haven't even started their program yet so it's really just a learning experience.\n\nI selected a company that said they needed help with an online tool. Most of us were people who were hoping to get into the information systems program and hoped to learn code but most of us had no idea what we were doing. I hadn't even had my first real programming class yet but did a little bit of programming for work. Because I had a little bit of experience I had a little idea of how to create it and made it work. We custom coded it and I did well enough that I landed a paid internship afterward with the company that I have to this day.",

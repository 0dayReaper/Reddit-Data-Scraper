            "comment": "I got a 710 (42Q, 46V) about 6 years ago using: Official Guides, GMATPrep free software &amp; Exam Pack 1, Manhattan Prep books (Foundations of Math and Advanced Quant). Took the actual exam twice, and 710 represents my second try. I think I was testing in the 720-740 range on the GMATPrep software, but there were some minor dynamics about the testing experience at South Jordan or Draper that made it hard for me to fully replicate my natural rhythm. I think there was something about you not being able to have watches, for example, so whereas you can calmly watch the clock during your break at your home test, in the testing center I spent break nervous somewhat about making sure I was back in time and didn\u2019t run over time.\n\nI studied over the course of fall semester. Worked through the Official GMAT Guides in full, reading through the logic of the answers I got wrong and spending time with it until I better understood what they were saying about the right answer, took monthly practice tests on the GMAT prep free software to test my progress, and toward the end used the Manhattan guides to spot-fix some of my specific weak points in math. The Manhattan guides are really specialized, so you can really focus in on specific topics that you are consistently weak on.\n\nSome people prefer doing Manhattan from the beginning, or other products. But this is what worked for me.\n\nGMATclub.com is a great resource, and I think the wallstreetoasis.com forum has a GMAT section too maybe. Lastly BYU probably has some resources either in the advising offices in the upper floors of the Wilk or in the Marriott School\u2019s advising offices. I had already graduated by the time I started studying for the GMAT but maybe BYU\u2019s stuff would have been helpful.\n\nGood luck!",

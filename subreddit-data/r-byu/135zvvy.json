    "postText": "I have the option to take CS 674 Advanced Deep Learning which I would love to take and I was wondering how time intensive the class is. I have heard that it is mainly reading academic journals and if that were the case I may do it I was just wondering if there were many projects on top of that. \n\nI understand that it is a 600 level course so it will probably be a lot. I just wanted to see if anyone had any insight into what happens in the class.",

            "comment": "I would imagine the topics would be pretty state of the art stuff since it will mostly be recent academic journal readings. Probably lots of summarizing of those readings.\n\nProbably would have a generative model like text to image generation or some kind of large language model as projects",

I'd talk to that person and find out the actual details/syllabus of the class.\n\nEdit:  Even if it's not listed, generally, who is teaching which sections of which classes are decided by the department at least 6 months in advance...  You could ask the department office who is scheduled to teach.",

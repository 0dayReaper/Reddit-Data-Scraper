One in particular will often leave his companion and follow me to the other end of campus trying to talk to me. Not only do I feel creeped out by this guy in particular but when I served you were basically never allowed to leave your comp and walk away. This was for everyone\u2019s safety. Is this weird or am I overthinking.",

If he's giving you creepy vibes, you 100% should talk to someone who can forward it to the mission president. If it keeps persisting, call the police. Your safety should be your #1 priority and don't feel bad calling it out just because it is someone you should be able to trust. Sometimes those people end up being the worst offenders.",

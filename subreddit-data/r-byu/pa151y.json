Really changed my mind on the cost of services. Though I agree when Julie pushes back and Alex Tabarrok admits that it doesn't explain all of the exorbitant price increases, it does point out that for there to be a \"general inflation\" that is averaged across the cost of all things, by definition some things will be faster than avg inflation and other things by slower than avg inflation.\n\n[http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/236-why-are-the-prices-so-dmn-high-alex-tabarrok-2/](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/236-why-are-the-prices-so-dmn-high-alex-tabarrok-2/)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s\\_cost\\_disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease)\n\n(apologies for the occasional swear, I'm still waiting for the podcast version of vidangel : ) )",

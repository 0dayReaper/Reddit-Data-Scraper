    "postText": "So as I am finalizing my plans for this spring semester, I have decided that I want to take Econ 378 and Econ 380 this spring. I wouldn't do this normally, but I will be doing an intensive research project next year that requires me to have the skills that those two classes teach. I will also be working with a professor this spring/summer on his research, so I will be working 20+ hours a week alongside taking the classes. \n\nIs this doable? Does anyone have experience taking any of these classes during spring semester? For reference, I just finished Math 112 and have the second-highest grade in the class, so any work with calculus in any of these classes should be fine for me. Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated!",

It takes some effort, but taking them together is totally doable, but will definitely take effort! \n\nGood luck! I loved 380. It gives some great intuition for the rest of the major.",

I think taking 381 might be more informative! 378 is pretty much exclusively probability theory/statistics so it won't tell you too much about the rest of the major. Happy to chat more about other options if you'd like.",

If you have a sound understanding of calculus you\u2019ll probably do pretty well in 380. I had a little bit of stats background going into 378 which made it a little easier on my part, but a lot of my more calc-nerd colleagues who didn\u2019t have any previous stats training had kind of a hard time with it. If you\u2019re curious, I wound up with Bs in both classes and given the fact I had significantly less of a math background than most of my peers I felt pretty good about that haha.",

I did 381, 382, and 388 the next semester and there were probably a good 10 or so classmates in all three classes with me.",

Not entirely sure on the specifics on the project since I\u2019m still working on solidifying the topic, but I\u2019ll need to collect data from 50+ countries and run multiple regressions. So I\u2019m taking 378 to learn how to do that and 380 because it\u2019s a prerequisite for 388",

I would honestly not try doing this while working a job, though if you drop that I'd say it wouldn't be too terrible.",

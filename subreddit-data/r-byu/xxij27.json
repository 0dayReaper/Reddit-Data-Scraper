Is there a chance that anyone has (or knows someone who has) a ring doorbell or other cameras? Or perhaps someone who is aware of a car with a new and suspicious dent?",

Even in a car this is true. I have avoided so many accidents just by realizing that other people don't pay attention. I'm not saying people shouldn't watch for bikers/runners, but bikers are the ones who will be injured in this scenario.\n\nThat being said I'd also like to mention that I have also seen someone hit a cyclist, almost hit many runners, and run red lights (I swear every time I'm at a light I watch at least 2 people run a red light by a solid 1.5-2 seconds).\n\nPersonally I have also been in two car accidents caused by idiots who didn't look/pay attention. So I get it. But you can't control what others do. You can control what you do.",

I agree that being predictable is very important when biking or driving although I will prioritize what I think will keep me safe over what I think a driver is predicting. I bike through the intersection of 700 E and 500 N. It is a four way stop, but I cannot think of an instance where I saw another biker make a complete stop. My memory is probably biased though. Just today, there were two bikers in front of me at the intersection that both went straight through as I was coming home. One of them almost hit somebody crossing the cross walk, and the other almost got hit by a car making a left. I am grateful I have never seen anyone get hurt, but there have been so many close encounters. This morning as I was biking to campus a car got to the intersection well before I did, and I think expected me to go straight through the intersection because they waited at the intersection. I got to the intersection and stopped. They looked annoyed and waved for me to go. I felt bad for making them wait a little, but I will always chose inconveniencing a driver at that intersection over risking getting hit.",

It's nice if you yield to someone when the right of way could go either way. It's annoying when you CLEARLY have the right of way, others are obliged to let you take it, and you don't.

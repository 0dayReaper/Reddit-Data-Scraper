    "postText": "So Im an idiot and i was messing around with the schedule builder and switched to a different section of a class. The class I was in still says full (even though I dropped it and the waitlists are done). I cant add it back\u2026 Ive already submitted a lot of work and this other section is on demand\u2026 the add deadline is in less than 2 hours\u2026 what are the odds of me getting back into that class if I email the professor? Would she be able to even do anything after the add deadline?",

However, I would still talk to your professor and let them know what you did as part of the petition process is the faculty commenting and agreeing with your petition. Having you explain it before they get that email would help them comment on it quicker.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I like every other stem major has to take Stats 201 this semester. However, the only options for professors are Gregory Snow and Jie Wang. I\u2019ve read previous posts on Jie Wang where they said she was pretty bad, however I can\u2019t find anything on Gregory Snow. If anyone has taken a class from him I\u2019d appreciate any advice as to which professor I should take.",

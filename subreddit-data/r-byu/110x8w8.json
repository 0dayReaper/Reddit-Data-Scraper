Essentially all you have to do is meet with you multicultural advisor in person or on zoom and talk to them about it. They take a handful of things into consideration, but more than anything, they look at your finances. They usually want a budget and your graduation track. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to apply. They also don\u2019t do scholarships the way some other offices do them. They evaluate at the end of every month, so you could get a scholarship for the current semester hypothetically. You can also reapply the following month if you\u2019re rejected and your circumstances have changes.",

They also match you up with an advisor and at the end of the week you take the ACT (though your score can only be used at BYU).",

By discouraging people from applying or looking for these scholarships, you're indirectly helping the people that would rather we not get the scholarship at all.",

It's definitely not for no reason. \n\nAlso, you're noticing that plenty of people struggle to pay for college but are directing your frustration at people getting a need based scholarship. Why not direct it at the university that isn't more willing to give more scholarships? Or the financial aid system that makes it nearly impossible for a child from a middle class family to get a decent pell grant?\n\nI'm on full academic scholarship as well, but am still working to get through. I don't blame those born into well off families because they don't need to work at all to get through college.",

    "postText": "Howdy BYU,\n\nA few buddies and I are coming up from Dallas for the Baylor game and really have not been able to find much information on what restaurants and (obviously) bars we need to try out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf there are any places yall suggest we go please let me know. Seems like ABGs Bar is the best place to go for a drink in the area but we love trying out local favorites when we visit other schools during football season.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

(He isn't wrong).\n\nI would say try visiting at least one of our soda places: Sodalicious or Swig.\n\nAs for restaurants:\n\n1. Bombay House is the best Indian food in town and it isn't close.\n\n2. If you want Polynesian food on the mainland, Utah is the state for you! Mo Bettahs is a good spot.\n\n3. Local Burger places, in no particular order:\n\nBurgers Supreme\n\nJCW's\n\nBackdoor Burger\n\nOr In n Out (not local, but certainly beloved)\n\n4. Try a Cougar tail at the game. It's 18 inches of maple bar that has only sent a few people into diabetic shock.\n\n5. BYU creamery or Handel's are good spots for ice cream.",

Ingredient quality, service, ambiance, menu variety, locally sourced, presentation, price, bang-for-the-buck, etc.\n\nAgain, Bombay House is good.

The DFW has tons of good Mexican and Tex-Mex places, so most places in Provo, even the good ones, will be a bit... underwhelming. I do think that Don Joaquin's makes some great tacos, though, and their prices are pretty fair (or at least they were when I graduated in 2020).\n* Avoid *all* of the barbecue restaurants. I never met anyone in my time at BYU that could make proper barbecue.\n* Both of the Indian restaurants (India Palace and Bombay House) are actually pretty good.\n* Brick Oven makes some pretty good (but expensive) pizza, and they've got good root beer, too.\n* I had a burger at Station 22 once that was pretty good. I don't remember the price -- it was a celebratory lunch and my boss was paying -- but I think it was pretty typical for a casual sit-down place.\n* I really liked the tonkotsu ramen at Koi Ramen. That's only a couple blocks from the stadium, too.\n\nThere used to be a Thai place that I thought was pretty good, too, but it looks like it didn't survive the pandemic.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a minor mistake: tonkatsu (which is a fried pork cutlet) should have been tonkotsu (which is a pork broth).",

Most of these comments are are likely coming from students or recent students who are comparing prices to fast-casual fare  and may have a different view of \"expensive\" than someone traveling in for a football game.\n\nHere are some suggestions that are within 30 minutes or so, depending on what you like or are in the mood for.  Most of the nicer places will have bar offerings, though not all.  I would check the restaurant website or call if you have questions.  You will want a reservation at many of these or the wait time can be long (if you can get it at all).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Mexican:  Sol Agave in American Fork is quite good.  El Tapatio in Payson (20-25 minutes south) is more standard but has a good pineapple fajitas dish.  Try the triple protein steak, shrimp and chicken which is served in a grilled pineapple half.\n* Fresh, locally sourced (nicer fare):  Communal in Provo or Block, also in Provo\n* Breakfast/Brunch:  Tru Religion, Orem\n* BBQ:  Bam Bams in Provo (I grew up in Texas and Bam Bams does it pretty well)\n* Unique mountain setting (nicer fare):  The Foundry Grill (more casual) or the Tree Room (more upscale) at Sundance Mountain Resort.  Its about 20-25 minutes from Provo\n* Southern:  The Porch in Daybreak/South Jordan (35 minutes north)\n* Southwestern/Navajo:  Black Sheep Caf\u00e9 in Provo\n* Steakhouse:  Carvers in Sandy is pretty good (30 minutes north)\n* Indian:  Bombay House, Provo\n* Pizza:  Pizzeria 712 in Orem offers traditional pizzas with a Utah flavor, Via 313 in Lehi for Detroit style pizza in a sports bar like setting.  Also, Brick Oven in Provo is a very local place that caters to families, groups and students\n* Traditional American:  La Jolla Groves in Provo\n\nHave a great trip and enjoy the game!",

They have a very wide range of beers they brew in-house and they even offer \"taster\" cups for 75 cents each so you can find what you really like before going all in. They also seem to have a pretty decent mixed drink selection.\n\nAdditionally, Strap Tank has literally the greatest mozzarella sticks I've had in my life.\n\nIf you're up for a bit of an adventure, further north in Pleasant Grove is Evermore and Vander's Keep, a fantasy theme park and restaurant, respectively. Vander's is a neat (albeit pricey) place to eat, if you got a bit of a nerd streak or just want some classy food (you don't have to enter the theme park to go to the restaurant, but the park is actually pretty fun).\n\nHowever, they also employ a world class bartender who makes some immaculate cocktails and mocktails. And honestly, the mocktails are nothing to scoff at; they are seriously and professionally well done.\n\nUnfortunately, Vander's Keep does not sell the World's Greatest Mozzarella Sticks as they don't sell mozzarella sticks at all. But even if they did sell mozzarella sticks, they wouldn't be the World's Greatest Mozzarella Sticks, because the World's Greatest Mozzarella Sticks are sold exclusively at Strap Tank.",

They have a very wide range of beers they brew in-house and they even offer \"taster\" cups for 75 cents each so you can find what you really like before going all in. They also seem to have a pretty decent mixed drink selection.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nStrap tank is a good bet for out of towners. Good food and good drink selection (alcoholic and non-alcoholic)\n\nVander's keep is a fun recommendation, they actually have really good food which surprised my wife and I! Little bit of a drive but a fun experience. \n\nIf you want Thai food, Baan Thai in Lehi at the outlet malls is the place to go but is pretty far away from Provo.\n\nFrom someone that tried to entertain out of state friends at bars in Provo while at BYU... I'd just avoid the bar scene. It sucks. The brewpubs offer a lot more quality and some good food to boot.",

Great bar and restaurant and a real staple in Waco.\n\nCrickets is a great bar, plenty of pool tables and beer on tap, Scruffs is the party bar. Lots of crazy stuff happens there but I was never really a huge fan. Barnett's Public House was fantastic while I was in college (2016-2020) but has really gone down hill since COVID with their service. It is one of the largest if not the largest whiskey libraries in the state, they literally have everything from Woodford Reserve to bottles from India and Australia.\n\nIf you want Mexican Ninfas and Hecho en Waco are great. Ninfas is you either love it or hate it type of place.\n\nFor BBQ Viteks is a solid option and a touristy spot but I am more of a fan of Guess Family BBQ.\n\nIf you are looking for nicer options 135 Prime and Diamond Backs are up there, not Dallas quality but still great for the area. \n\nPersonally I stay away from the magnolia stuff, but I get it if you want to go over to their restaurant and the silos. I just feel like it is over priced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd just a heads up, there are certain areas I would not go to after it gets dark. Waco is not as bad as it once was and they have done a great job cleaning the city, but there is still also of homelessness in some areas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had a ton of fun when yall came last season, I really cannot wait for you guys to join the Big12!",

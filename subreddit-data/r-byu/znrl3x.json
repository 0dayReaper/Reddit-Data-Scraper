Take some lighter classes next semester, meet with a therapist/counselor and the University Accessibility Center. There is an option to petition your grades so they don\u2019t count against you. Talk to the Academic Success Office on campus and they can advise you what to do in your specific situation. I\u2019ve met with them before and they are really understanding and helpful. \n\nBYU is a hard school and there are other schools that will be easier if you want to transfer. College also sucks sometimes and it\u2019s ok to come back to it later under different circumstances. My mom failed two semester of college and didn\u2019t go back until she was in her 40s. Now she has a PhD. You don\u2019t need to have everything figured out right now.",

If I remember correctly you will probably get a warning this semester and but if it continues you could risk academic probation. \n2. Take a lighter semester when you get back to ease back into the grind. Use this opportunity to build your study skills and time management habits. \n3. Meet with a mental health counselor. There are a fair amount of resources on campus to help students. It may not be a perfect system but it\u2019s better than nothing. This may be helpful as it could help you secure academic accommodations in the future.\n4. Take the next three weeks to clear your head and reset. A bad semester won\u2019t haunt you your entire life nor is it defining. Reflect on what went went poorly and crate a plan to do better.",

I know it feels like a waste, and you\u2019re probably so tired and burned out, but one day you\u2019ll look back on this semester with so much gratitude and pride in yourself for how far you\u2019ve come. \n\nMental health in college is such a hard thing to manage.

That is all you need to take in order to keep your job at BYU.  \n\nIf you want CAPS therapy (7 sessions of counseling, with a current waitlist of 8 weeks), you would need to be taking 9 credits, however the CAPS receptionists can help you get exceptions by talking to the clinical director. The only reason people might need to take 12 credits is if they\u2019re on scholarship or they\u2019re living in on-campus housing (Heritage or Helaman). \n\nAdditionally, if you are suspecting you have ADHD, the University Accessibility Center (UAC) does ADHD testing for only $50!!! That literally is hundreds of dollars cheaper than outside clinics.\n\nPlease DM me if you have questions, I know quite a bit about the ins and outs of BYU\u2019s exceptions and resources I can help you get connected to",

I failed my first semester (All F\u2019s), and was put on academic probation for it. I switched from in person classes to online school and I thrived! I went from failing out to being on the Dean\u2019s list. Online learning might not be for you and that\u2019s ok. I struggle with crippling depression and I have days where it\u2019s hard to get out of the bed so online learning worked for me. All that to say it you\u2019re not alone. Get in touch with your advisor and let her know what happened/is happening and see what your options are. You\u2019ve got this!",

            "comment": "You could consider taking next semester off. Taking a leave of absence is something I feel like not many people know about but within a academic year so F, W, Sp, Su you can decide to just not go to a semester (and you don\u2019t need to tell anyone to do so). It won\u2019t affect your place at BYU either. You just take all of your classes for the next semester out of your My Map cart (before the add/drop deadline) And if you want to, you can take off one semester each academic year and you will be fine. Say you took off this winter, if you needed to you could take off the next winter as well. Me and my husband both did this in order to take a break for our mental health. It was especially nice taking off winter semester because then we also didn\u2019t have school in spring or summer and until fall semester. It was extremely helpful. The only thing is that you may want to double check with your major if it is okay (contact your major academic advisor and ask if it will affect anything, I feel like in most majors it won\u2019t\u2014 I am in a design major). \n\nFor your job on campus, my husband also had a job on campus when he was deciding whether or not to do the leave of absence. What I would suggest is to let your manager know that you are taking a leave of absence for medical reasons (mental health) but you would really like to keep working as a non-student. You will need a doctor\u2019s or therapist\u2019s note to confirm your condition. But I know that they gave my husband some forms and I believe the whole process was going forward. My husband in the end decided to leave that job before the whole process was complete, but I believe the same thing could be done for you too possibly. (If you decide that is too much of a process and decide to leave your job. A job you can get quick and makes decent money(you\u2019ll need a car) is door dash. In that semester off that is what my husband did -you can choose your own hours! So that is really nice when there is a rough day mentally. And he made $18+/hr )\n\nI hope this helps, and if you have more questions about it, i am totally willing to answer more! Before we knew all of this it was a really scary decision. But after learning that it was completely fine and there would be no negative consequences that would happen with a leave of absence it was a no brainer to do it. Actually my husband is doing another leave of absence this winter semester again because of mental health reasons again. He also just wanted to work full time and make a lot of money. You don\u2019t need to do a leave of absence for any specific reason however, you can just do it. But I\u2019m rooting for you. It was a super, super mentally taxing semester for me as well, just with things out of school. My grades suffered so much. But just know it it will be okay. Another semester after getting yourself in a better place could bring better grades and just one semester of good grades can balance out a semester of bad grades. It will be a slow process to get your gpa better but it can happen! You\u2019ve got this!\n\nAlso, on BYU\u2019s website go and type in \u201cleave of absence checklist\u201d and you\u2019ll get a ton more info!",

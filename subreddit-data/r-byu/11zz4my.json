I put myself on the waitlist for helaman and heritage halls, and I read somewhere that someone just waited about a week for getting a message. So I'd just sign up and wait for a bit.\n\nIdk how they'd have enough housing if all freshman students are required to stay on-campus the first year????? So I think I'm gonna call housing to ask a couple of questions. Lemme know if you wanna know what I find out.",

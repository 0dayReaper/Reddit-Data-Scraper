    "postText": "I'm going into the Mechanical Engineering degree, but I still need to take Dynamics and Mech of Materials. I've had my handful of great and very difficult professors, so I wanted to do some more research and find teachers that I would really enjoy. I'll likely be taking Dynamics and Mechanics of Materials in the fall and was wondering which teachers you would recommend?  \n\n\nThanks in advance! Y'all have a great summer!",

            "comment": "I took those before I transferred, but for a lot of engineering classes, you will find that you don't have much of a choice of instructor. Sometimes it changes semester to semester, but they usually cycle between the same 2-3. From what I heard, the female Dr. Magleby was the only one teaching dynamics, not sure if that's changed. Arguably more important is finding a solid study group and getting on the TA's good side. Made it through Calc III because I had an awesome study group and we taught each other because the professor sucked.",

You might not learn a lot but she's a nice professor. Mech of Materials is similar. When I took it a year or so ago, there was one guy who taught it who has since quit. I imagine there is still only one professor who teaches it, but I don't know who.",

They both want you to succeed and have set up plenty of resources for you.\n\nDon't take them at the same time (it's possible, but it will not be easy). Form a good study group for dynamics. Commit yourself to at least an hour in the TA lab a day.",

I had it from him this winter and it was his first semester teaching it, so I\u2019m sure it will only get better as time goes on. Be sure to take advantage of the TA lab though!",

I liked Prof. Magleby because her approach is moreso to teach you the basics and let you understand it better through the homework. I've never had Dr. Salmon, but I've heard good things.\nAs for mechanics of materials, I've heard rumors that Sorensen will be teaching a section, along with another professor (don't remember who lol). I don't know anything about them unfortunately \ud83d\ude02.",

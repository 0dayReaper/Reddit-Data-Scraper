    "postText": "Is there anywhere on campus or REALLY close to campus where students can park? I'm sick of having to park 20 minutes away all the time. I know there are parking garages in some places on campus - are those restricted or can students park there? How often are lots monitored by BYU police because sometimes I'm only on campus for an hour and wonder if I can get away with parking in an A lot... Honestly, I don't really want to park any further than JDawgs haha",

Any streets branching off of it are also free, just be aware of where the no-parking zones begin and end. Even if you park 3 blocks away on the south side you can still make it to any class within 15 minutes by walking. Parking right on the side of that south street reduces the time to 10 minutes. I think there is also a free parking lot on the south east end of campus north of the J-dawgs but south of the UVX stop.",

Or bring your bike to cut the walk time from your car to class. You might get away with parking in an A lot a few times. You 100% will get unlucky and will get ticketed eventually. \n\nBYU has invested in a lot in public transportation being available for its students. Most students have absolutely no need at all to drive. Those that do because of where they live/disability have accessibility options available to them. I won't judge your situation, but do recommend you try not driving at all if that's an option for you.\n\nIf you have any questions about the bus system, you can dm me. I ride the UVX to school every day, rode the FrontRunner during the summer to get to my internship.",

Sorry man, I know the parking situation is horrendous with BYU tearing out lots when they really need to be building more. I wish they would build a parking garage for students. You may or may not get ticketed in an A lot depending on the day, but def don\u2019t park on actual campus or you for sure will",

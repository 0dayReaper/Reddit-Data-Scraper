If it's something super important you can go late at night or early morning and ask them to look for you if they're chill.",

So your package may get to campus on Monday but the mailroom won\u2019t have it sorted and delivered until the next day and then you have to wait for the Students working the desk at the Heritage hales main building to get you the email. Depending on delivery time and when the desk is staffed this would explain why it takes so long to get your package.",

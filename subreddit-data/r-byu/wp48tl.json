            "comment": "Do you mean the tire outside or the inflatable tube inside? If you've got a punctured tube, you can get patches from a bike shop or something like Wal-Mart. If the patches don't hold up, then just buy another tube and put it in. You'll know the size of the tube by measuring the diameter of your wheel. The most common valve for inflation is the schrader valve. There are some bike racks on BYU campus with a thing that has a cable with a bunch of tools attached to it that you can use for changing a tire, and probably some other bike maintenance, too. Two I can think of are one just south of the Wilk and another between the RB and the Smith Fieldhouse. Look up a vid for how to change a bike tire tube for instructions for when the time comes. Careful to avoid pinching the tube and making a hole while you're putting it back on.\n\nIf this is more than fixing a flat, then I'm afraid I have no expertise in that and don't know how to help. But I wish you well!",

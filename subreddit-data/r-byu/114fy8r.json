            "comment": "&gt;An individual wishing to apply for admission whose membership is withdrawn from the Church, who has formal membership restrictions in the Church, who has resigned membership in the Church, or who otherwise lacks an ecclesiastical endorsement, may request an exception to this policy by completing an Application for Exception to Policy form. Undergraduate applicants may obtain these forms from the executive director of Enrollment Services, and applicants to graduate programs may obtain them from the dean of Graduate Studies. The burden of persuasion is upon the applicant to clearly demonstrate to the university through the information submitted that the relevant facts and circumstances warrant an exception to this policy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The executive director of Enrollment Services, or his or her designee, will review the Application for Exception to Policy for undergraduate applicants, and the dean of the relevant graduate school, or his or her designee, will review the Application for Exception to Policy for graduate applicants. The reviewer may also personally interview the applicant, who may further explain the circumstances that might justify an exception to the policy of not admitting individuals whose membership is withdrawn from the Church, who has formal membership restrictions in the Church, who has resigned membership in the Church, or who otherwise lack an ecclesiastical endorsement. The reviewer may not speak to the applicant\u2019s present and former ecclesiastical leaders unless the reviewer receives the express written consent of the applicant. If such consent is not provided by the applicant, then the Application for Exception to Policy will be determined based on the information otherwise available.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After reviewing the applicant\u2019s Application for Exception to Policy, the reviewer will make a recommendation to the president of the university, who has the sole authority to grant exceptions. The president will grant an exception only in very limited cases where the president determines in his or her sole discretion that the relevant facts and circumstances warrant an exception to this policy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If an exception is granted and the individual is admitted as a student to the university, then the university may place an Honor Code hold on the student\u2019s record. The Honor Code hold will remain in effect until the issue giving rise to the Honor Code hold is resolved. If the individual has not resolved the issue within one year, he or she may be dismissed from the university.\n\nFrom [https://policy.byu.edu/view/admission-policy](https://policy.byu.edu/view/admission-policy)",

Unless there is a program that you desperately need to get into at BYU you may want to consider a different school. Other Utah schools might be a good option if you'd like to attend a school with a similar but not identical cultural environment. Only U-Poly(Former Dixie) has a reputation for being a party school and even then it's pretty tame by party school standards. Those would be better options than paying the high price to attend BYU if you just want the kind of college experience Utah offers.",

                    "comment": "I second this. Obviously there's a reason you left the church (no judgement here) but often BYU can bring out the worst parts of it. That reason is just going to bug you more if you come here. There are many things here that drive me crazy about BYU and I say that as an active member. BYU is really a unique and sometimes harsh environment, and I think few actually truly thrive here.\n\nDon't rejoin the church just to get in. Only do it if you really feel like that's the right thing to do moving forward with your life. Your leaders can often tell your intentions too, so if it's not sincere that might not be as easy as a path that you thought. There are a lot of great schools in the state that offer similar, or in many cases, better programs than BYU and I think you might have a better time there.",

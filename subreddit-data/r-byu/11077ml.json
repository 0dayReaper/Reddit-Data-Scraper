    "postText": "**Professor:** David Sims\n\nSo I am a CS major currently taking MATH 113, PHSCS 121 and A HTG 100. Those are my only heavy classes this year. And I have a couple of questions about American Heritage, for context, I'm just  trying to get it over with. I think it's cool but I'd rather study math and science then philosophy. No thank you.\n\n1. **Is is possible to get a C or higher just participating in the lectures, studying the lecture notes and going to the review labs?** ***I***\n   1. *I know it's possible with CHEM 105 and 106 (literally did not touch the book at all, got a B-), but this is the first non-science or non-math class I've taken at BYU. So I really have no idea what to expect.*\n2. **Exam prep and study tips? I'm already going to the lab review sessions.**\n3. **In your experience, what was on the exams? People, concepts, etc? Please don't say \"everything.\"** \n4. **How much of the readings are on the exams? I have been doing well in the weekly quizzes where I only use the lecture notes (our quizzes are open notes).**\n\nI really don't have the time or the mental effort to get an A in this class. I'm focusing that effort on calculus 2 and Newtonian physics. Please advise if possible. Thank you!\n\nEDIT: It is possible to do well in the class without doing the reading and focusing on the lectures and labs.",

It was online for covid, but TA lab was in person.\n\nI didn't even go to the review lab lab everyday, only on the week of tests.\n\nI wouldn't say you're gonna cruise class, but you could do decently well. If you have the same class structure I did.\n\nHere's how I studied for tests:\n\nDid readings. At lectures they usually discuss the points of each reading you were supposed to do. But to be honest there were some readings I didn't do or forgot to do. But they discuss the readings in lecture, ta lab, and review labs. So don't sweat it if you miss one here and there, you can get by.\n\nI will say, if you're reading the City upon a Hill book, and the class is still run how mine was, you don't really need to read that one. I would just speed read it or skim it.\n\nKnow the main points you discuss in class. The points of the readings you discuss in TA lab. And the points of the readings you discuss in the review lab right before tests.  Know the bullet points of all the powerpoints and notes and your set. That's really all I did. I make sure I knew each of those readings/philosophies etc. I got an A or A-. I can't remember which one. \n\nIf you can summarize decently each reading or author then you should be pretty good. \n\nTests are mainly concepts and on readings but know the people tied to each concept/reading.",

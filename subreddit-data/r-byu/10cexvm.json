From a religious perspective, if you make that sacrifice for the Lord, He WILL make it possible to get everything done during the week. From an emotional/mental health perspective, you need to give yourself one real day off every week or you are going to burn out.",

Of course, your opinion is just as valid and as important as mine :). I just wish you had been around in the late 1800s to tell off Brigham Young for hating black people, I\u2019m sure you would have been as passionate about that as reminding OP to not study on Sunday. And what you said about mental/emotional health is totally true, I totally agree about not burning out! Take care this semester.",

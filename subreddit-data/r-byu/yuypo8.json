    "postText": "This is literally SO embarrassing but I\u2019ve been really struggling the past few days with low energy, like im sleeping 12+ hours and still exhausted (yes ill be working with my dr on this) anyways, its kinda too late to try and get accommodations but my classes have been suffering. My religion class has been suffering the most, because its well\u2026 religion. Im 90% sure theres no chance of passing now, even if I ace the next 2 tests, just because I haven\u2019t been to class or turned in the weekly assignments. If theres no chance of passing, should I just stop doing the work and focus on my other classes? Also is a D- passing or failing? Finally, if I fail a class, will I lose my needs based scholarship that I needed to take at least 12 credits to get? Because Im at 12 credits right now and im not sure how failing a class affects that, I just dont want my scholarship to be retroactively taken away (not worried about next semester but this semester)",

            "comment": "Almost this exact same thing happened to me one semester. I ended up having mono! But if you have accommodations through the accessibility center then your professors HAVE to work with you. So it may be worth it to meet with them in case any other professor gives you trouble. I ended up taking \u201cI\u2019s\u201d in my classes (incompletes) and had one year to turn in all makeup work.",

It's not actually too late for accommodations, and even if it was, if you explain what's going on as best you can most professors will work with you even without mandated accommodations. Some might require you talk to the Accessibility office but others will work with you even prediagnosis as you figure things out. \n\n They may let you turn in assignments late or redo some work. Probably won't get you up to an A or anything, but will likely help you pass. And I don't think you have anything to lose by talking with your professor.",

I also am not sure whats even causing this fatigue, Ive been working with my dr on this since march. But i did just check and it looks like I can still pass as long as I do relatively well on the exams",

He should not be passing this off on TAs.  If a professor is non-responsive to concerns communicated by a student this should be reported up to a department chair.  But before pushing in that direction I\u2019d recommend going to him with a plan in place, including an explanation of your personal situation, what you are doing to remedy it, and a plan for completing any missing work he might accept for part credit.",

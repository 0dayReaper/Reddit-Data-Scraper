No job is worth losing your credentials over- not even the church. If you see something that is not right, and you have to sign your name to, you should think long and hard about it. The Church Auditing Report during Conference better be pretty damn good. The auditing division should be fired over this if they signed off on it year after year, which they did. That CPA at the end of your name is too hard to get and too valuable to lose over ANY client- period.",

And if you didn\u2019t know, those funds are funded with tithing payments. \n\nSometimes we wonder what would Jesus do. \n\nAnd I can\u2019t help but feel like if Jesus was here on this earth and had access to billions of dollars. He would make sure those funds would help improve lives around the globe. \n\nBut\u2026 they don\u2019t. \n\nThey go into investment accounts that make money, Apple stocks, Facebook stocks , Amazon stocks. You get the point. And the church hides them in shell accounts. \n\nSo now we have Prophets, Seers and Revelators that had to ask themselves what would Jesus do, and this is what we have for the last decade. Breaking the law,  and now the church has a 5 million dollar fine on its hands.",

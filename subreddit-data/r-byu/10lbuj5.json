    "postText": "Is there anyone who has lived in Alta with the current management who can give me a little review of your experience? I'm looking for housing starting in the fall and I've heard the new management is bad, but it's in a good location for my job so I am wondering if it would be worth it.",

The new management is a little stricter on house checks than last year, but nothing like the horror stories I hear out of some housing complexes. This is one of the few complexes where you can complain about stuff and it usually gets fixed. Rent is cheap and you only pay for gas and electric. It's not incredibly spacious but you'll pay more for the same rooms and worse management in almost any other shared housing in Provo.",

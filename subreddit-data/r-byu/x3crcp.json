And yes they do.\n\nCAPS (counseling and psychological services) is BYU's therapy program. You'd probably need to get on a wait-list, but you'll get an appointment soon enough. They're pretty good, and totally free. Go to caps.byu.edu and/or call 801.422.3035",

If you give it a shot and feel like you need more sessions than are available or don't vibe with the therapist,  you can always ask to see someone else.\n\nLooking outside (they might have this available at CAPS?),  it might be valuable to research therapy modalities.  For example: intellectualizing feelings is my go-to coping mechanism and talking about traumatic experiences leaves me feeling more anxious than I did going in.  Therefore traditional talk therapy (CBT) was very unhelpful.  I found more value in EMDR.  When you find someone you want to see, I recommend emailing them and setting up a 10 or 15 mimute phone call before you blow the money on an official consultation.  You can ALWAYS fire a therapist if you do not feel safe or seen in your session.\n\nIf you want to try meds at some point in combo with your counselling, you can consult with your primary care doctor or see a psychiatrist.  There's a lot of stigma around meds, but this is your healing and whatever works for you is best.\n\nI wish you the very best and, once again, shout out to you for looking out for yourself!",

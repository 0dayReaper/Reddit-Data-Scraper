            "comment": "It really depends on what your strengths and weaknesses are and what you want to get into. \n\nHere's how I remember it from a few years ago:\n\nControl systems could be challenging at times but is also really useful if you are going into any type of manufacturing. \n\nVLSI was challenging but you might need it if you want to go work at Intel. \n\nPower electrics would be similar to previous circuits classes where you have labs that can take up time or can get frustrating if they don't work, but it is useful if you want to deal with power. \n\nI remember the EM radiation class being really fun and not too stressful. Easier than the junior level class.\n\nI thought Digital communication class was fun. With that one the labs will be deciphering some bits instead of sitting there wondering why your circuit isn't working. If you like puzzles you might enjoy digital communication.",

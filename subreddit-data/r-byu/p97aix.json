Did they not do any deep cleaning of the apartment/room during homeless week that would justify keeping it vacant for a week?\n\nAlso, it's like $5 to have a copy of a key made at those self service kiosks in Walmart and Lowe's, the landlord will never know unless they find you using the copied key haha.",

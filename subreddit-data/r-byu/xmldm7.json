There aren't really any AP classes and clubs where I am so choices for extracurriculars are very limited so trying to figure it out lol (Also side question, do returned missionaries get any perks in BYU applications?) Thanks to anyone in advance",

            "comment": "There are many factors beyond AP classes and extracurricular activities that matter. The biggest will be that you explain why a BYU education matches your spiritual and professional goals. Your essay will likely be the part that will be heavily considered. However, beyond a mission look for other ways to volunteer and give service in your community this will help to show community involvement which will help the admissions team see that you stand out. Since you are interested in BYU Idaho try asking more questions there as their program is a little different. You can also boost your chances by participating in some BYU pathway classes as they are administered through BYUI.",

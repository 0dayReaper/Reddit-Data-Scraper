The research articles we read focus on heterosexual couples and we often read things by apostles. That being said, the main gospel points that were stressed were waiting until marriage to have sex and then being loyal to your spouse. The professor I had gave a disclaimer on the first day of class that this would be the case.\n\nThat being said, most of the class has to do with sexual response cycles, ways to communicate about sexual desires, how to overcome challenges to sex (pregnancy, busy schedules, aging, unequal desire), birth control, sexual disorders, the orgasm gap\n\nThere was one lecture that focused on same-sex attraction. Unfortunately, I had to miss that lecture due to work. I don\u2019t remember anything anti-LGBTQ+ in the PowerPoint slides. \n\nI\u2019d be happy to reach out to some friends who also took the class and get their opinions! DM me if you\u2019d like me to ask around.",

For one, it's so uncommon, but they still use \"heteronormative\" as if being hetero is not the norm; and people, all people are naturally adverse to differences.  \n\n\nSecond, gay males have the highest rate of STD infections across all populations. They have aberrant and degenerative behavior, and would rather complain about the lack of medical care instead of changing their lifestyle. All while claiming \"abstinence only education doesn't work,\" well neither does take 20+ dudes a night, but only one leads to not being a STD petri dish.  \n\n\nThird, there's an over-representation of gay males among child molestors. And given how hard things like drag-queen story hour or teaching young children they can change genders and crap like that; I don't think I need to explain why this is a negative.  \n\n\nSo for something to be \"heteronormative.\" Yeah, it's how it's worked since the beginning, and will continue to work when we're all dead; cry more.",

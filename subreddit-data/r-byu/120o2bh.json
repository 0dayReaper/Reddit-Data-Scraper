    "postText": "My contracting date was really late - and ill have to go on the waitlist. I have two main questions:\n\n 1. Is the waitlist reliable and worth \u201cwaiting\u201c on, or should I just do off campus contracted housing? I\u2019m worried that transportation will be a major nuisance, but there are no currently available bed spaces.\n\n2. Was there something I could have or should have done to get a bed space before they were all gone? And why is it set up this way?  \n\n\nI\u2019m a Canadian freshman going to BYU this year turning 18 if that helps at all. Thanks.",

Im just wondering how long I should stay on the waitlist before I look at off campus contracted housing, since that opens may 1st. it\u2019d also be nice if I could get your opinion on whether on campus is better for a freshman or if it\u2019s ok to be off campus as well. I\u2019m worried mainly about the food and transportation",

The same can't be said if you live off-campus. While off-campus may work better for some, I think in general, living on campus that first year is ideal.",

Absolutely horrible. I hope BYU makes an example of him and makes it public to send the message that those sorts of words and actions cannot and will not be tolerated.",

Elder Holland observed in the next paragraph that the student chosen to speak at graduation is meant to represent the entire graduating class. The way Elder Holland phrased it, I think he would have a similar opinion to a student taking the opportunity to propose to his wife over the podium. \n\nI want to reiterate, Elder Holland did NOT condemn the student for coming out. He condemned the time and place the student chose to do so. \n\nRelevant quote from Elder Holland's address\n\n&gt;If a student commandeers a graduation podium intended to represent everyone getting diplomas in order to announce his personal sexual orientation, what might another speaker feel free to announce the next year until eventually anything goes?\n\nAnd a relevant verse from D&amp;C 42:91:\n\n&gt;And if any one offend openly, he or she shall be rebuked openly, that he or she may be ashamed. And if he or she confess not, he or she shall be delivered up unto the law of God.",

The talk itself was specifically for faculty, and knowing that the speech was approved by faculty/staff (whoever approves speeches), his comments regarding it were more aimed at those who approved it. And although it certainly resonated with many students, I understand that the topic of individual sexuality doesn't really have anything to do with the greater mission and purpose of BYU.

Jesus was very loving when he cleaned the temple, but that doesn\u2019t mean the recipients of that love felt very loved at the time. \n\nI believe that if he tried to couch the message in softer terms people would live in the wiggle room. Certain parts of our beliefs, including the eternal purpose  of the family and gender being an important part of our divine nature are being, to use a Book of Mormon term, poisoned by degrees from external pressure. That needs to be clear to incoming students who are being taught by practically everyone that truth is relative and that all lifestyles are equally valid. We needed someone to singe our ears a little bit.",

I myself am the child of interracial parents who met during their missions. Is it a possibility that the Church\u2019s broad approach/views towards LGBT people may be less inspired by God and driven more by people\u2019s shifting predjudices? All humans/cultures have them, and objectively, the church has difficulties in relation to this community, as organized communities often do with any variety of communities.\n\nSpeaking as an LGBT person and one employed in the arts/media, I find that a large plurality, if not a majority of my peers/colleagues are LGBT. I\u2019ve always wondered why LGBT people congregate towards the arts/media industries. For whatever reason, LGBT people are driven towards certain careers and perhaps God has intended that in the grand scheme of things? In any case, I find that fascinating, if not at the very least an interesting anecdote.\n\nObjectively speaking, attitudes towards the LGBT community will change over time, so much so that the church is actively addressing it. The church may be lead by God, but ultimately, it is an organization run by men. Flaws make us unique, it isn\u2019t wrong to have flaws, but perhaps the Church\u2019s approach isn\u2019t particularly helpful or productive at this moment in time.

The book of Jacob explains polygamy, and black men had the priesthood in the early church- we don\u2019t even know when or where that policy changed. That was a clear mistake. Even if it wasn\u2019t, all over the Bible the priesthood or even the gospel has been temporarily restricted to one race or even one group within a race. \n\nThis, though, would be directly counter to church teachings on the eternal nature of gender and the family unit, and has never been permitted in Christian history. There are temporal commandments that are intended for a limited time, like the law of Moses, and there are eternal commandments like \u201cthou shalt not kill (or, more correctly, murder)  that have never been changed.",

It goes along with Matthew 25:35-40, where Christ blesses the people who helped those in need and condemns to hell the ones who don\u2019t.\n\nAre you also implying that the LGBTQ+ community is possessed by the devil? Let\u2019s follow this logic: why can\u2019t President Nelson exorcise them now? Either a) they\u2019re not possessed, or b) President Nelson doesn\u2019t have the power of the priesthood.

The LGBT community has changed the meaning of the rainbow over the past couple of decades and it  is now the symbol of their movement.  It isn't propaganda like dropping pamphlets out of a plane, but the rainbow is used to publicize a political cause or point of view, which by very definition is propaganda.\n\nExpressing an opinion that differs from yours doesn't make mine homophobic.  I have a long history of hiring, working with, living next to, and being friends with many people who are gay.  I very much appreciate all of the diversity that they have brought into my life.  I believe they would say the same about me.\n\nAs to the agenda being pushed, it is my experience that those who just want to live their lives in peace, and love who they love, do exactly that.  They aren't the ones out at political rallies, or standing with colored flashlights on Y mountain to make a political point, or even chalk up the walkway of a public place.  They simply live their life like the rest of us.  None of the atrocities that have happened to the gay community should ever have happened, and we should all actively seek common ground and legislation to make sure that people are treated with love and respect, regardless of your position or belief.  However, the agenda that I have seen pushed by the LGBT community for the past 20 years in California is far different from \"we just want to live our lives in peace\" and they are  seeking far different motives.",

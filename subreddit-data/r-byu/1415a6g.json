    "postText": "First of all, I am a non-LDS international student attending a top 40-50 liberal arts college(US news ranking). Also, I will be a junior next semester and majoring in computer science.\n\nI decided to apply to BYU due to its cheap tuition (Since I am an international student, it is hard to get a financial aid from other universities.)\n\nCurrently I am paying around $30000 per year including tuition, boarding, and meal plans.\n\nHowever, I think I can reduce the cost to $22000(including scholarship) if I attend BYU. Since my house is not rich, my maximum budget for one year is $30000 (I really want to reduce cost).\n\nMoreover, my current university does not offer many computer science courses, and I already took most of the courses.Finally, I think I will have more opportunities in getting an internship than at my current university.\n\nThese are the reasons why I am considering transferring to BYU(cheap cost, more computer science courses, better internship opportunity(?) ).\n\nHowever, I also saw lots of negative opinions about BYU when it comes to non-LDS students.\n\nTherefore, I would be grateful if you guys can give me some advice regarding this transfer decision.\n\nThank you.",

Non-LDS were a small minority, maybe a thousand students, but that's plenty of potential friends who you start meeting in the intro to Mormonism class. When I was there this group was a mix of internationals and athletes. The LDS were extremely nice and friendly, and you could find loads of common grounds through campus clubs.  As long as you have no problem abiding by the honor code, I would say it could be a great experience.",

I've had internships for the last two years, and in another right now. My program has a lot of career opportunities and connections, so its not particularly hard for my major if you try. The CS program is a lot larger than mine, so I don't know how competitive the internship/job market is at BYU, but BYU has great career services, so with some effort on your end, I think you would be able to find a job within your major, whether its a BYU job (I know BYU has a fair amount of CS student jobs) or an internship.",

But that\u2019s the thing that makes the university unique. \n\nYou also have to take religion classes to graduate, most of them are fairly easy and can even be useful for people who aren\u2019t members, but this can still be a turn off to some people.",

            "comment": "I went into BYU as a recent convert to the LDS religion and left the school as an ex-Mormon. Even the experience as an active Mormon was horrifying. There are several things you should seriously consider:\n1. If you are not white, you are going to be a super minority and are at risk of being fetishized by returned missionaries and otherwise. \n2. You have to adhere to the Honor Code, which now also includes clauses about demonstrating (protests) and you might find that BYU\u2019s values don\u2019t align with yours. Also be prepared for your peers trying to convert you to their faith. They will likely send missionaries to your apartment, single you out in class discussions, etc. \n3. You will be required to take at *least* 10 hours of religion courses, most of which are directly related to LDS theology and history. These credits are meaningless everywhere else. Additionally, BYU makes it very difficult to transfer your credits to another institution. If you found it to be a miserable experience and wanted to go elsewhere, you\u2019d have a hard time doing so. \n4. To echo what has been said already, scholarships are extremely competitive and are prioritized for LDS students in my experience. \n\nIf you are looking for a cheap and beautiful option, Utah Valley University is just up the road. I would look into them if the Provo area is an important factor for you. I am also happy to share more of my experiences as a recent graduate of BYU if you are concerned about the culture there, especially as one that is not LDS.",

            "comment": "It totally depends. I myself absolutely despise the school. I came here last year because of the cheap tuition as well. I was in a situation where I had enough money to do about 2 years of tuition at typical US private colleges before taking on debt and my grades weren\u2019t good enough to get scholarships at the schools I wanted to go to. So I picked BYU. I now wish I had just gone to a different school. I hate it here. In my opinion you have to be 3 three things to do well here socially. 1. Conservative 2. White/Raised in the Mid West 3. Mormon. I fit into none of those categories. I personally find the Honor Code very restricting and there is a culture where kids reports other kids for the tiniest violations. I grew up in a big city so I find Provo to be super boring. Not a nature guy either, and pretty much the big thing here is to go out on hikes, biking etc. People will treat you differently if you are not mormon. My sister left the church and her mission when she was about 3 months in. People viewed her differently after that, many of her \u201cfriends\u201d immediately cut contact with her. Dating is difficult, getting married early is pushed super hard. I know several people who got married their freshman year. It\u2019s crazy how many baby strollers I see getting pushed around campus. The library even has a separate section dedicated for people with babies. Food sucks too if your not from the States. I took a pretty heavy workload my first semester and was juggling both internships and a job the same time, that in combination with the fact I felt like I could not be myself and surrounded by a bunch of Molly Mormons drove my anxiety and depression through the roof. I\u2019ve had a horrible experience here so far. My personally opinion would be not to go. Your grades seem pretty good, try transferring to a decent school (maybe something that\u2019s ranked between like #25-80 in the US) and get a scholarship there, it\u2019s definitely possible.\n\nEdit: \nI will reluctantly add that BYU has a great network and resources in certain professions, and aside from the religious aspect, education is high quality. It would probably be ranked like a top 25 school if not for the mormon aspect. The only reason you should come here OP is if you already live a \u201cLDS-like\u201d lifestyle. If you don\u2019t, then don\u2019t come.",

It can vary based on where you live, shop, if you have a car etc. but probably somewhere between $24,000 to $30,000 would be the total. I paid $6000 for tuition my first year however this coming year I will be paying $3000 since I got a merit scholarship meaning that I did well in school and got above a 3.9. At least that's how I think I got it. I don't recall applying for any scholarships, I just woke up one day and in my email there was one that said I had recieved a merit scholarship. \n\nAnd yes I will definitely be transferring after my sophomore year.

Even after graduating, you will not be able to build Alumni relationships, since the Alumni gatherings and programs revolve around Church activities and you will be easily \"othered\". Remember universities are places where you build your networks for career growth and lifelong friendships. \n\nThe loneliness is very real. And if you are not white-passing, you may struggle a bit too. Especially on Sundays when campus shuts down and so does much of the town of Provo.\n\nThat said cost can be a big deal especially for international students. Sacrificing your mental health might be worth it as your goal is to find a job and stay in US, and BYU definitely will help. I think many international students make that trade off since mental health is worse in their home countries due to various issues.",

I'll be there for fall.\n\nMy family is comprised by me, my husband and 2 kids (5 and 1 yo).\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of living on/off campus?\n\nWhere can I look for family housing off campus? All the groups in fb I've seen so far offer singles bedrooms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

Definitely stay on the waitlist for wymount and live there if you get off the waitlist. It\u2019s really difficult to find an affordable place with enough room near campus. Even the seemingly expensive ones are rented right away. You have to be super diligent in messaging and applying to places. However, if you\u2019re willing to pay more, finding a place shouldn\u2019t be too hard.",

            "comment": "You pro on campus is that housing at Wymount/Wyview is relatively cheap for a two bedroom(Being under $1000) with Wymount being cheaper as it is older. That's going to be the bottom of the price range you are going to see for standard housing rentals in Utah county though it may be cheaper to move farther away from campus. Luckily as as student or student dependent your ID lets you ride the UTA busses for free so you can live further away. Likely you're going to have to look at somewhere between Springville and Payson to find something affordable but these communities are nice and the wards there are a little more stable than the family wards around campus. I'd use map options on KSL or Facebook Market Place and peg you cost at $800+ and you should find something.",

Many will be unfurnished, but you should be able to find someone selling what you need especially with the semester ending. Trick or Facebook is to join a bunch of the renting groups and scour posts in them. A lot of people don't list them properly so they won't get caught by normal search terms.",

What brands do you recommend that aren't super expensive? What type of jacket should I be looking for? Any tips would be super helpful!",

Doc Martins, Uggs, hiking boots, or off-brand versions of the same are all great. Trudging through slushy, salty snow in tennis shoes first thing in the morning will quickly equal a bad day with cold wet feet. \n\nIf you do only bring tennis shoes, bring a few pair so you can alternate while the first dries out.",

I have a coat that has an insert that I can take out to use as a sweater or to use the outer layer as a rain jacket or windbreaker for warmer weather. As other people mentioned, you need at least one layer that's windproof, because that seriously affects how cold you'll feel.\n\nI also highly recommend getting good warm gloves, especially if you plan to bike anywhere. Most poor clothing choices in cold weather will be uncomfortable, but forgetting your gloves will *hurt*. Look for something windproof here as well.",

Buy some sturdy shoes or boots that will allow you to keep your feet on icy concrete and won\u2019t leak if you step in slush. Any sporting or farming goods store in Utah should sell good quality stuff, but do yourself a huge favor and buy before it snows. There\u2019s always a rush for all of this stuff every fall going into winter, and you don\u2019t want to be stuck picking over what everybody else left behind on the shelves.\n\nI personally recommend the Little Hotties brand thermal insole.",

Sometimes it was overkill but I absolutely loved the heat-tech liner that Columbia has.  \n\n\nGloves: some cheap knit ones will be fine for most days except the coldest.  \n\n\nShoes: invest in some waterproof boots that are comfortable. I know you're a student on a budget but I think if you're going to spend money in one place on your wardrobe it should be shoes. Waterproof hiking boots or duck boots or something. Get something that goes over your ankle; snow will get high enough at times that not having that coverage is going to suck.",

But it will keep you plenty warm. \n\nAdd gloves and a beanie hat and you'll be good to go. Wool socks in the tennis shoes if your feet get cold, though I usually did regular socks.  Avoid puddles. Jeans tend to be adequate for day to day.\n\nAs others mention, add a layer under the coat if you still feel cold.  Buildings are nice and toasty, so that's why a coat works well-- something you can slip off easily. \n\nClimate change has really mellowed out Utah's winters. It even freaking rains in January sometimes. (It's not supposed to ever do that!)\n\nSource: Native who lived 31/37 years of my life in Utah. (I hate winter).",

My senior year of high school, assuming I would be accepted to BYU, I watched the weather progression in provo from October through March to see when things would get bad and how bad. I was really nervous for how bad it would be. One day out of nowhere it was in the 30s and I braced myself for the pain on the way to church, but it was too bad. A hoodie will suffice usually but if you want more then a winter coat should do it.\n\nI would compare the weather to American Heritage. There is a lot of hype about both. People think it they are both very difficult to live through and miserable and to even succeed well. But those who get through it will tell you it's not that bad as people say. Not a walk in the park, but also not a storm.\n\nAlso, get gloves. That is a must!! Other than that, you got this, you'll get an A.",

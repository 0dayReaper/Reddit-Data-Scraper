The employees in question demanded that the Agency change the deduction amount. Management suggested paying one cent more ($6.67). Those complaining started screaming discrimination. They couldn't pay one-cent less ($6.65), because those of us who did not hold such beliefs in evil dollars and cents complained that we would be discriminated against.",

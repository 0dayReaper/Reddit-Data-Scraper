I was wondering if anyone has taken MCOMM with Jana Hansen over spring before and what the workload was like.  I have heard the MCOMM is a hard class and I am worried I am overloading myself. Does anyone have advice?",

I think it\u2019s a class that\u2019s pretty heavy on assignments to begin with, and with the condensed schedule you feel that even more. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s particularly difficult, so you should be fine with a full time gig if it\u2019s your only class, but it will eat up some time.",

    "postText": "[Background] I (24F) am dating someone who could very well lead to a marriage. Currently, it\u2019s going to be a few months out at the least and to a year or two at the most, because this is my last semester of school and he\u2019s doing intense training in another state (he\u2019s military), we\u2019re trying a LDR. \n\nI\u2019m looking to take one or two classes this semester to help well round myself and just prepare and learn the best I can. Which is something I like to do. \n\n[Question] So\u2026 What sort of classes did you enjoy taking that you felt helped prepare you for marriage? Or you wish you had taken? (This can be for married, engaged, and dating peeps) \n\nI know there\u2019s a marriage prep classes, and I\u2019ve heard family finances and intro to family processes were great classes to take. I\u2019m looking for more opinions and thoughts because a lot of my close friends have not taken any of these classes! Thanks! :)",

Also, to clarify I don't think there's anything wrong at all with downloading the stuff from LS, as long as you don't distribute it. It's sometimes just easier to get it all from the professor.",

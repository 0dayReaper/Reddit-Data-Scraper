Anyone have good experiences in an online class that's offered spring or summer and knocks out letters?\n\nAlternatively, are there in person professors teaching those that are still ok with zoom?\n\nI heard IHUM 202 is good, but the professors who teach it online seem to require far too much rote memorization or too many papers according to rate my professor",

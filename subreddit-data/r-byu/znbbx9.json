All the work you end up doing for the class is making a portfolio website of different assignments you did in Spanish classes that demonstrate your competencies in various areas.",

There are a number of jobs that having a degree in Spanish is at least a benefit, plus the many jobs that just require a degree rather than one specifically. Some careers that you can go into with a degree in Spanish include:\n\nForeign Service worker\n\nInternational Relations Consultant\n\nSocial Worker (obviously requires more schooling)\n\nTravel Agent\n\nJournalist (covering the Hispanic world)\n\nFlight attendant\n\nTour guide\n\nAll this to say, just because a career isn\u2019t traditionally considered \u201cprestigious\u201d doesn\u2019t make it unimportant. Not everyone can be a doctor, lawyer, engineer, etc., and we need people like journalists, tour guides, and flight attendants.",

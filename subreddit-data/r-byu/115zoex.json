    "postText": "I got rejected. What are some good options for universities to go to for a semester or two before trying to transfer? Preferably in the state. I have already applied to a few around the state but I don't know what my best option is. I hear UVU isn't a good option because it is deemed \"too easy\" but I don't know for sure. Is the FEX GE a good option? Or would my best option be going on a mission and having a parent apply for me while I'm out / apply once I return?",

            "comment": "Honestly, I think everything you listed could be a great option, including attending UVU. It\u2019s a great school that many people love. You could also go to a local community college for your associates and then apply again. I couldn\u2019t quite tell your intentions from your post, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t serve a mission just to try to increase your chances of going to BYU. Go on a mission if you feel that\u2019s the right thing for you to do. I truly believe any school you attend with the intent of going to BYU later could get you there, it more matters what you do while you\u2019re attending. Keep your GPA up, get involved in extracurriculars, and find other ways to build your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. So as far as picking one, pick one that has a community and price that you\u2019d feel content with.",

Professors genuinely care about you and are willing to work with you. It\u2019s a small town but the school and institute put on a lot of socials that make it easy to find something to do. \n(Pro tip- be part of the institute committee to add to your \u201cBYU resume\u201d for transferring).",

Also, the whole \"UVU isn't a good option\" is absolute nonsense. They offer way more degree programs than BYU I believe and they are much more flexible in terms of when they offer classes. They have a great reputation so yea anything you hear about UVU not being up to par is just not true.",

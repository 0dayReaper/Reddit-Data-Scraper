Is there a website or some ideas to deal with this kind of situation? I\u2019m so naive with this so I hope Reddit will help me, thank you!",

Do you want a photographer to take a picture of you and your spouse weeding outside the temple and in the garden of the reception area?  Or do you want a photographer who can do some weeding on the side in between snapping some photos in order to keep things looking clean.\n\nAlso, make sure you and the photographer consult the farmer's almanac on being clear about noxious weeds that torment mankind.  My cousin's brother in law is still fuming about their weeding photographs from their special day.  After they had paid to get a favorite picture framed, they realized that the plant they were jointly pulling out by the roots wasn't a weed at all -- but a flower that had only formed the axillary buds and just looked like a weed. The hobby lobby framer had studied botany before dropping out of school, and could not hide her amusement at their faux pas.",

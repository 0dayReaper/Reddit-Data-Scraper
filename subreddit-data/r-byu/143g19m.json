    "postText": "Hello, I am currently a student at BYU-I, however I want to transfer to BYU. The problem is I have an awful transcript. \n\nLast semester I had a severe depression episode and could not get out of bed, because of this I have one UW and two W in my second semester. I have one W from my first semester because of plain stupidity. I am in my thirh semester. I plan on retaking the classes I got w in and hopefully get A but that would be a fourth semester at BYU-I . My current gpa is 3.27. Is it possible to transfer? or have a screwed my chances",

Luckily I was able to get the whole semester petitioned off a year later. \n\nIf OP can get their depression under control then I don\u2019t see why they shouldn\u2019t move.

At BYU you have an extra 2.5 weeks in the semester to cover the same amount of material and most classes I\u2019ve had have had a final grade curve which I never experienced at BYU-I. Honestly, I feel like BYU-I is a little harder having done the Biomed in both. In terms of acceptance\u2026. They might want a higher GPA but I say just go for it and see what happens. My GPA went up when I started attending BYU because it was just a lot easier. I think a lot of people struggle at BYU because it is a more social school so they get dragged into that but the coursework is easier no doubt",

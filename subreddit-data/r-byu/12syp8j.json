I wanted to work at a zoo or aquarium at some point in my life, and I wanted to know if there were any good ones near byu I could go to, either for work or recreation. Whenever I look on Google maps, all I find are pet stores and petting zoos.",

[https://www.hoglezoo.org/](https://www.hoglezoo.org/)   \nThe Living Planet Aquarium is in Draper as stated.

These are your two main options if you want to work with wildlife. They are quite different and set you up for different career paths. \n\nWWC sets you up for a career in the land management or state wildlife agencies (UDWR, USFS, NPS, BLM, USFWS, etc). There will be wildlife management, botany, rangeland management, animal nutrition, and ornithology classes. You will have to take 20 specific classes that are your required base and then you will take certain electives to qualify yourself for different jobs   The federal government has very specific requirements if you want to work as a wildlife biologist for them for example. \n\nBDC is another major in a totally different department. It is a more general evolutionary biology degree that will not set you up to work in the land management field. It will not guide you to super specific career paths. \n\nEither degree would be suitable for a career in zoos. Note that to work in zoos you often have to volunteer for a year just to get a job that pays minimum wage. Also, that job is more than likely glorified poop scooping. There are very few jobs in the world where you will be playing with animals. Even the state agency jobs that manage wildlife are over-glorified and underpaid. Sorry, not trying to be a downer but I wish there had been more realistic communication when I started. There are jobs (many seasonal, low-paying) but few of them will be directly handling wildlife. Also, if you are wanting to be a vet, go to Utah state or elsewhere because BYU has basically eliminated animal sciences here. \n\nTLDR; do your homework on your future career goals and the classes/internships necessary to get yourself there. There are various paths with different pros and cons.",

Does anybody know the recipe (or dupes) so that I can make it on my own? It's the only mac salad I've ever liked and the katsu sauce is so good I need to learn how to make it. If anyone worked in the cougareat id love your inside info here",

            "comment": "Not that I work there but Katsu Sauce is typically made of \n\nKetchup   \nWorcestershire Sauce   \nSoy Sauce/Oyster Sauce   \nand Sugar  \n\n\nWhile making it yourself is pretty easy I suspect like many things at BYU(I'm looking at you Mint Brownies) that the sauce comes from a pre-packaged mix or can. I would love to be wrong of course but you cut corners while you can.   \n\n\nThe Hawaiian Macaroni Salad Recipe is pretty easy to find.   \n1 pound macaroni  \n\u25a22 tablespoons apple cider vinegar  \n\u25a22 carrots shredded  \n\u25a21/4 cup onion shredded (optional)  \n\u25a22 1/2 cups Mayonnaise Best Foods or Hellman's mayonnaise (no substitutes!)  \n\u25a21/4 cup milk  \n\u25a22 teaspoon sugar  \n\u25a2kosher salt and pepper to taste  \n\n\nFinally Chicken Katsu-   \nTake a chicken breast and cut thin. Then pound to tenderize and flatten the chicken. Lightly Coat chicken in flower/salt/pepper. Dip chicken in 1 beaten egg then tip in panko bread crumbs and fry until  golden brown 3-4 minute per side. Then dry on a paper towel.   \n\n\nCombine all and serve.   \n\n\nYou'll have to experiment around to see if you get what you want but it's not a hard dish to prepare. Good luck and enjoy the tasty Katsu.",

I don't know the exact proportions on their mac salad sauce or katsu sauce, but the katsu sauce isn't too picky usually and the mac salad recipe you listed seems like it would yield a result pretty close to AP from my experience.",

    "postText": "Hi y'all, BYU grad of a couple of years ago here. I live in a big U.S.  city and have noticed that, like many places, there are some slightly  more \"feminine\" (I don't really believe that these concepts of what  gender is exist, they're just constructs obvi) fashion/dress stuff for  people who identify as male is starting to take off in the mainstream,  even among men who identify as straight. Some of these include: wearing  pearl necklaces, painting nails, wearing one or two earrings, brighter  prints, tighter pants, etc. etc. (think Harry Styles as the best  mainstream example of this, lol). Just curious for anyone who's still at  the school: has this become an issue at all for students, and/or has  BYU had to make any adjustments to the dress/honor code to police how  male-identifying people dress? (Obviously the dress section of the honor  code is 90 percent designed to police and objectify female bodies, but  as the concept of traditional femininity/masculinity in mainstream  culture starts to break down, I'm wondering if we'll see the church have  to address this as well, starting with how students dress at BYU.) Lmk,  and happy to chat with anyone! Thx",

            "comment": "The Dress and grooming standards are pretty equal for men and women here. It may disproportionately target women because more of women's clothing may be sleeveless, revealing, and form fitting but the standards are near the same. You might argue that men have more restrictions in the grooming department shaving and haircut requirements but over all the policies are about the same. \n\nFrom the Dress and Grooming Standards: [https://policy.byu.edu/view/dress-and-grooming-standards](https://policy.byu.edu/view/dress-and-grooming-standards)   \n\"Men\r  \nA clean and well-cared-for appearance should be maintained. Clothing is inappropriate when it is sleeveless, revealing, or form fitting. Shorts must be knee-length or longer. Hairstyles should be clean and neat, avoiding extreme styles or colors, and trimmed above the collar, leaving the ear uncovered. Sideburns should not extend below the earlobe or onto the cheek. If worn, moustaches should be neatly trimmed and may not extend beyond or below the corners of the mouth. Men are expected to be clean-shaven; beards are not acceptable. Earrings and other body piercing are not acceptable. Shoes should be worn in all public campus areas.\r  \n\r\r\n\nWomen\r  \nA clean and well-cared-for appearance should be maintained. Clothing is inappropriate when it is sleeveless, strapless, backless, or revealing; has slits above the knee; or is form fitting. Dresses, skirts, and shorts must be knee-length or longer. Hairstyles should be clean and neat, avoiding extremes in styles or colors. Excessive ear piercing (more than one per ear) and all other body piercing are not acceptable. Shoes should be worn in all public campus areas.\"\n\nThe problem comes to enforcement. I suspect it is more likely that the clothing policies get enforced with women rather than men. Walking across campus it's not uncommon to see men (at least in the warmer months though there are some bold fellows who don't mind the cold in shorts all year) wearing shorts that are not knee-length or longer. So I suspect there is lax enforcement there. \n\nWith most professors they don't want to be enforcers. They signed up to teach not to regulate other people's behaviors or bodies. Sure you have a few who like that kind of thing but most would rather do the job they were trained for which is scholarly work. It's the deans who usually get read the riot act by the administration and above and then have to come down on the professors forcing them to be the bad guys. The Hornor code puts everyone in a bad spot but even it is out of BYUs hands as it was adopted by the Church Education System.   \n\n\nNow to your question.   \n\n\nI don't think there is anything particular to the honor code that would preclude someone dressing more feminine or masculine. It's not there in the text anymore. In there past under the \"Live a Chaste and Virtuous Life\u201d Section there was  the line \u201cThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and BYU affirm that sexual relationships outside the covenant of marriage  \nare inappropriate. Examples include but are not limited to the following: extra-marital relations, promiscuity or predatory behavior, aberrant behavior, solicitation of sex, homosexual conduct, and cross-dressing.\u201d But the current honor code has clipped that language.   \n\n\nI am sure culturally in Utah it would raise an eyebrow. I was in a store the other day and a young man had two pierced ears with dangly earrings and it stood out because it isn't very common here. We'll always lag behind especially as Utah and BYU are really focused on business culture rather than self expression and while a few businesses have embraced that kind of openness many still want to maintain strict dress codes and \"professional\" appearances.",

            "comment": "Last semester my professors re-iterated the importance of the dress/grooming code for both men and women. There was a message from the deans stating that they'd seen an increase of what they felt were \"rebellious\" students purposely dressing against the honor code standards. This was in the business school and it was definitely a point that almost all of my professors made last semester.\n\nI don't think BYU will be changing their honor code any time soon. They don't really care much about what the world dresses like and want to maintain their \"professional\" look in dress and grooming. Individual professors or the testing center employees may be more lax but the governing body of BYU likely wont be changing anything IMO anytime soon. Especially to make things less \"professional\" looking with the dress code.",

Maybe dresses also. Not sure. Other than that, I don't think BYU cares or has grounds to get anyone in trouble.",

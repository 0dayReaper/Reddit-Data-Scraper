    "postText": "One of the things I've most looked forward to about coming to BYU are the religion courses. From anecdotal reports from friends, I'm told a lot of religion classes are glorified Sunday School with no homework or spiritually and intellectually stretching content. That's not what I'm after: I want to actually learn something. What's the most difficult religion class you've taken at BYU and why?",

            "comment": "Most of them are unnecessarily difficult with busy work and things you probably already know. You're asking the wrong question. A better one would be which ones teach the most. And honestly, World Religions is the only one I can vouch for in that category. I took it from Mike Mackay. Kind of hard, super interesting and educational with stuff I didn't know. Everything's still from an LDS lense, but he asks some good questions and you really do learn a lot.",

I was blown away by one of my Book of Mormon classes where I had to write a pretty extensive scholarly essay about the war chapters in Alma. As a convert, I hadn't developed familiarity with the non-doctrinal plot line aspects of the Book of Mormon. That class helped me feel like I understood the plot of the Book of Mormon on a way that resembled my understanding of plot in parts of the Bible like Kings and Chronicles.\n\nAlso remember having to write a pretty scholarly essay for one of Camille Fronk Olsen's classes. She's one of those superstar professors who regularly appears on BYUtv (or used to, at least). My essay was about house church / secret worship in early Christianity -- not sure what the class would have been called. But I recommend anything she's teaching. I wonder if she is divorced and is Camille Fronk now -- for some reason I feel like I remember hearing something about that. I also feel like I remember hearing something about her being retired. Idk.\n\nGood luck.",

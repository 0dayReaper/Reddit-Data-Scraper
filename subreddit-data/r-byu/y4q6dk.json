Its about 50 of the 190 pages in the PDF then it goes on to identify the strings of these 55 invisible abuses in \"Book 2\". It's the best list I've found so far. The post I originally found it on was on r/exmormon but it's been deleted? Said it was just released on Tuesday. It's making big waves in Utah so far. There's a table of contents on page 11. A TL;DR too. The part with the list starts on page 129.  It talks about intentionally abusive studies at Harvard from a Columbia University \"doctor\" in the 1960 as the start to perpetuating these abuses in modern time cultures of millions of people including Mormonism. The parts about Harvard, Columbia University and BYU start on page 83 but using the word search tool brings up more. Turns out a whizkid from Harvard was one of the victims and turned out to be the Unibomber. Has some tough words for these schools. Wants to shut down their law schools because of other corruption and 9 traps they use to target people. I have no doubt we can all relate to all of these. \n\nSays PDF is free for a limited time. \n\nThe list:\n\n1) Invalidating\n\n2) Virtue Signaling\n\n3) Projecting\n\n4) Tethering\n\n5) Wedging\n\n6) Fear Mongering\n\n7) Shame Mongering \n\n8) Victim Shaming\n\n9) Guilt Mongering \n\n10) Gatekeeping \n\n11) Social Control\n\n12) Financial Control\n\n13) Liechemy\n\n14) Helicoptering\n\n15) Commandeering\n\n16) Appropriating \n\n17) Throttling \n\n18) Purple Heading \n\n19) Tribe Jacking\n\n20) Scoreboarding\n\n21) Bait-And-Switch\n\n22) Baited One-Upping\n\n23) Trip Wire Testing\n\n24) Blame Roping\n\n25) Pitchforking\n\n26) Baited Ghosting\n\n27) Stigma Stamping \n\n28) Sneaking \n\n29) Stalking \n\n30) Impersonating\n\n31) Gag Mongering\n\n32) Purloining\n\n33) Selective Memory\n\n34) Forced Repetition\n\n35) Scripting\n\n36) Abiotic Hijacking\n\n37) Splicing\n\n38) Outro shaming\n\n39) Character Mongering\n\n40) Profit Mongering\n\n41) Apathetic Pretending\n\n42) Gaslighting\n\n43) Puppeteering \n\n44) Animal Mongering\n\n45) Frankenaltruism\n\n46) Esoteric Mongering\n\n47) Affinity Fraud\n\n48) Provoking\n\n49) Accident Enabling\n\n50) Capital Crimes (&amp; Attempted Capital Crimes)\n\n51) Frankenalchemy \n\n52) Deflecting\n\n53) Snowflaking\n\n54) Veiled Confessions \n\n55) Black Mirroring",

I had like $400 left at the end of my freshman year so I stocked up on tampons, razors, shaving cream, etc. Basically just staples I knew I would use at some point and don\u2019t go bad.",

It worked for everything, not just groceries. Jamba Juice also sold BYU t shirts so I bought a bunch of those for Christmas presents.",

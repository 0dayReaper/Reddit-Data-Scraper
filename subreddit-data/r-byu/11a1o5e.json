    "postText": "I'll be attending BYU Law School in the fall and I'm from the east coast. I'll be flying out to Provo next month and was hoping to figure out where I'll be living. I've reached out to the admissions office and they've provided me with a list of apartment buildings near campus; I've also been on a Facebook group dedicated to BYU housing. The only issue is that it seems all the contracts available are for the summer. Does anyone know how I can secure a contract for the fall this early? \n\nThe reason I'm trying to get this done now is because I work full time and I don't know when I'll be able to fly out to Provo again.",

            "comment": "Now is the perfect time to find housing for fall. Most apartment complexes make you sign a year long contract, that starts in August and goes til the following August. Everyone on Facebook is just people who signed year contracts but have summer internships and are trying to find someone to take over their contracts for the summer. \n\nTo sign up for contracts starting in Fall it's best to reach out to the management companies directly. For example these guys are accepting housing applications for Fall:\n\nhttps://legendrealestate.managebuilding.com/Resident/public/home\n\nAs are these guys, except they only accept applicants under 30\n\nhttps://cougarrentals.com/rent-by-room/",

A private room in a shared apartment will be like 500 and a shared room in a shared apartment will be like 400 a month. You have more options the further you go from campus but within a mile of campus is going to be mostly marketed to students, who want roommates.",

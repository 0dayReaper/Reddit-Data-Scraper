    "postText": "I used to attend Art College and now I am aiming for BYU CS-Animation Major. Since I failed few courses last semester, I'm really concerned if I can try to apply for BYU-Provo 2024 Winter or not. I only got 1.5 Month to prepare for transfer. Also, I only earned 21 Credits, so I might have to send my High School GPA which is not really good. I want to try application at least for the next month, but I am not sure if I'm doing it right and if the admission center will accept me. Should I continue prepare for the transfer or not?",

If you want to be an animator that major won\u2019t give you the route you want, though. The animation major itself takes about 20 students a year. \n\nThat said, I want to again say to not get your hopes up to get into BYU in the first place unless you get some really good extras and get a very good grade streak at a local college.",

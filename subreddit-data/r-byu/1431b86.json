    "postText": "I will be an incoming freshman this fall, however I am coming in with 60 dual credit hours that I got while in high school. Ever since I was little I have wanted the college experience. Is it possible for me to do 4 years of college with already having all of those credits? I haven't decided on a major either so I'm in a bit of a sticky situation.",

Dependencies for the classes you take for your major and minor could make it take four years to graduate even with generals out of the way.\n\nMy second or third semester I had to meet with one of the counselors before I could register.  The counselor hadn't looked at my transcript and was confrontational about how I could get to be a junior without choosing a major until I explained and he looked at my records.\n\nBy your third year, you'll probably be tired of school and looking to graduate to get to graduate school or get a job.",

Fail a couple classes, switch majors once or twice and it's amazing what you can accomplish!\n\nRealistically, not all of your credits are likely to be completely useful for graduating (mine weren't) and if you're still worried, just pick up a second major.",

            "comment": "Depends on your major/decisions. I came in with a ton of AP and dual credit hours (slightly under 100) and managed to graduate in 3.5 years. I also chose my major early on and never switched. I did civil engineering, a longer major.\n\nWhat AP and dual credit did do was cut down the number of hours I needed to take each semester. Every semester besides my very last one, I never went over 14 hours. I still put in the same effort as my friends taking 18 hours, but I did much better in my classes since I was much less spread out.\n\nIf you're doing an Economics major, which isn't necessarily easier, just A LOT shorter than other majors, then you might graduate in 3 years or less.\n\nIf you end up switching majors, it's okay, and remember that the classes you did take in your old major could count toward a minor.\n\nTLDR How long you take isn't an easy question to answer. It just depends on your major and if you switch. Those credits will make individual semesters lighter though.",

My first semester, I took 15.5 credits and I also aced the challenge exam for my mission language, which gave me another 16 credits, so after my first semester I had 94.5 credits (keep in mind you need 120 to graduate, and full time student was 14 credits at that time).\n\nI continued on to take classes year-round through winter, summer, spring, and fall, with the only break between my first semester and graduation being spring 2020, partially due to covid. In the end, I graduated after 4 years (so, \"normal\" college experience) with 233 credits and was never warned that I had to finish up.\n\nI don't know if this contributed to the lack of warnings, but I had two majors and two minors until my 2nd to last semester, when I downgraded one of the majors to a minor. But as long as you're timing degree requirements reasonably (not to slow), you shouldn't have any issue.",

How long college takes will depend largely on what you want to do.\n\nI came into BYU with 120 credits from community college and AP/IB tests. I actually got a letter reminding me to register for graduation while in my first semester in the freshman dorms. \ud83d\ude1c But it was just autogenerated based on the number of credits I had.\n\nYour credits will probably reduce the number of general Ed classes you need to take. Also, it should give you higher registration priority which is great for getting into popular classes.\n\nHaving a lot of credits out of the way actually gives you a great opportunity to do more at college. I double majored, but you could also do a major and two minors or just take really interesting classes outside your major, especially ones that are \"less practical.\" It's not like high school where there are really strict rails for what you can do. Enjoy your college experience!",

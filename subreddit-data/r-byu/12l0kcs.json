Great class but if you\u2019re like me, and this is your first time programming, you will need to set aside ample time to work through the book and practice videos. Awesome course and I have learned a lot. Needing an 85 on the final for an A. Most students have a better grade than me though. Tough class but lenient on grading to make up for it. First half of class is almost all individual assignments. Second half is completely group projects. Python OOP first exam. Python/Django MTV second exam.",

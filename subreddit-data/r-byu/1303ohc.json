    "postText": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m currently attending byui online and I\u2019m about a year away from graduating. \n  I recently finished my associate degree and want to transfer to BYU. The only concern is that I would have to take additional classes meaning I would graduate a year or two later. Would it be worth it?\n  I like all the aspects of the school and the program (business college). I want to hear your thoughts as a current student or alumni.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\nUpdate: I got accepted. Thank you so much for all of your comments",

If you also want to get some of the on campus experience you didn't get with BYUI online, it's great.\n\nIf you just want to pay as little as possible and graduate as quick as you can to start working, you'll get a better ROI from banging through it online and getting a job.\n\nPersonally, I think the in person and on campus experience would be worth it.",

At least BYUP has a national reputation - BYUI does not. In any way. \n\nI realize there are parents who only will support someone going to a Church school.

Seems pretty harsh to judge someone based on the school they go to. \n\nLots of good students go to BYU-I, and as a result of it being so affordable, they graduate with no student debt.\n\nYou are totally free to think that way, but I'm just glad I'll never be working for you.",

This attitude, unfortunately, contributes to the challenges our younger generation in college face today.\n\nI realize that you're not the only one who thinks this way. Fortunately, the majority of employers have a more holistic approach when hiring. They place less emphasis on the prestige of the school one attended, opting instead to evaluate candidates based on their interview performance, work-related skills, and personal traits.\n\nIn fact, take a look at this thread that came out just today: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/13gf548/after_14_student_deaths_north_carolina_state/\n\nThe pressure for prestige and how a school \"looks on my resume\" is just getting out of hand.\n\nNot your fault of course, but I think opinions like yours add to the problem.\n\nI'm actually a mid-life, returning student. For me, the cost of going to BYU-I is $79 a credit. There is NO place I can go, not even my local Colorado community college, that would beat that price.\n\nCould my education be considered less valuable due to this? Perhaps. However, BYU-I is reasonably ranked and, crucially, it allows me to graduate totally debt-free. I'm aiming for Software Development degree.\n\nThe fact that there are employers out there, like yourself, that would disregard it because of a silly dress code or because of an acceptance rate makes me laugh...and wince.",

Again, nothing you're doing is illegal, so you're free to think whatever you want. It just seems close-minded to me.\n\nI'd like to pose a counter-question: How would you react if you possessed the necessary job skills and applied for a position, but your application was rejected simply because you're a BYU graduate? \n\nImagine a scenario where the hiring manager holds the prejudiced belief that \"Mormons are crazy\" and wouldn't consider hiring you, and wouldn't even consider conducting an interview. So he always just tossed any applications from BYU. Would you consider this a just evaluation?",

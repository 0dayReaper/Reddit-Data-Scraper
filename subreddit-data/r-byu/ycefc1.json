    "postText": "Hi guys, I started BYU as a freshman in 2018 and took my last set of classes in Winter 2021. I failed a lot of classes my last two semesters, and ended up dropping out (I thought permanently at the time) due to severely struggling with my mental health.\n\nBy some miracle I'm actually a lot better, and I really want to finish my degree at BYU. I spoke to my academic advisor who told me I didn't have to reapply, but I guess she was mistaken. I talked to the Admissions office who told me I needed to reapply, but that it was too late to reapply for Winter Semester. I am super heartbroken, and worried I won't get back in due to all my failed classes.\n\nSo here's my question. Does anyone know how easy it is to reapply, and what resources there are. Is there anyone I can plead my case to to even reapply for Winter 2023 instead of having to wait until Fall? I'm willing to do anything to get back in but I have no clue where to start. The admissions office wasn't very helpful and seemed sort of confused lol, but maybe it was just the person I talked to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: typo on my dates",

I'm assuming you mean to reapply for winter 2023.   \n\n\nGood news you won't need to play any admissions fees again with your application. You may have ended up speaking with a student in the admissions office which might explain some of the push back though it is likely you'll have to go through the application process again.(Especially the Ecclesiastical endorsement.) I would connect with your academic advisor again and explain what response you got and see if they can help advocate for you to get back in.   \n\n\nNow you may find yourself on academic probation when you return to BYU, based on your grades from before, which means you'll have to keep your grades above a certain level for the first semester back. You may find admission a little more flexible if you're willing to start spring semester. In the interim you could start up some of the BYU online classes to get you back in the swing of things before you're back at the Y.   \n\n\nBest wishes that everything works out and we can see you finish up again here on campus.",

I just fixed my typo :) \n\nI tried to connect with my academic advisor but they said I could no longer meet with with her because i'm not technically enrolled as a student, and advisors are meant to help with class registration, advice on your major, etc. I do see that they have Admissions Advisors, so I'll schedule an appointment with one of them. I think you're right that Spring Semester would be a better bet, but I'm going to ask about getting in for Winter anyway haha! \n\nI think it's a great idea to enroll in a few online classes in the meantime, thank you for the advice! \n\nI really appreciate your response, I'm started to feel a lot better about this whole thing.",

            "comment": "Hey, so I flunked out of byu in 2007, then reapplied and went back in 2015 or so. I honestly didn\u2019t put much effort into my application because I didn\u2019t want to go back to byu, but anywhere else didn\u2019t want me cuz I flunked out (go figure!). The process wasn\u2019t very difficult, they just want certain time thresholds met before you apply again, I think it was 1.5 years, but I could be wrong. I did take some classes in the years I was gone at a community college, which did wonders for my own mental health cuz I went back to being the smartest in the room for a bit. \n\nEssentially, the academic advisor told me after I was back that BYU really wants people to graduate, so if your reapplication shows that you\u2019re in a better situation to do that then you were when you left, you will be welcomed back. That makes a lot of sense, BYU\u2019s success metric is really based on percentage of graduates, so they have a large incentive to help you graduate after you start there. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be afraid to apply for next year and just save some money, and if for some strange reason you aren\u2019t accepted follow up and ask admissions what you can do to get back and they\u2019ll either say \u201cschool policy is x time before you can come back, so you have to wait another x months\u201d or something like that in all likelihood. I also don\u2019t think they particularly care about deadlines and such for reapplications. I submitted mine without really paying attention to the time of year and got the acceptance within that week. \n\nAnyways, that\u2019s a lot of information, I\u2019d be happy to answer any other questions you might have. I graduated and got pretty good grades and was a TA for my latter half of school, so I\u2019m living proof that bad grades don\u2019t define your future (and I stayed on continuing academic probation for like 3 semesters after getting back while dragging my GPA off the floor). You\u2019ll get there!\n\nEdit: as far as difficult and such, I don\u2019t remember there being any particular steps. I found some reapply link online and filled it out\u2026 not sure how helpful that is. I\u2019ll take a peek and add another comment if I find it.",

And it would be nice to feel smart again hahaha. \n\nThank you so much for your response!

I know people who have done it and I feel like I\u2019ve seen people talk about it in this sub before. Please note that I have not done this myself so take everything with a grain of salt! It never hurts to ask your academic advisor though",

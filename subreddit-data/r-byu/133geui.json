I am thinking about changing my major to Psychology and would love to know more about this major. How difficult is this major?\n\nI am going to be working almost full-time just for this coming Fall semester. How many credits do you think is manageable? I usually take 12-15, but my previous major was Dietetics.",

However, I would caution you that psychology is one of those majors in which you really kind of need an advanced degree to do anything in the field. So, what I would suggest is taking an introductory psych course like psych 111, and deciding if you are still interested. If you are, welcome to psych. BYU\u2019s psych department is absolutely fantastic, and you find a great community there.\n\nAlso, I usually take 12-14 credits. I have ADHD and work as a research assistant, and find it\u2019s manageable :)",

You could probably take easier psych classes and you'd have more time to work though.",

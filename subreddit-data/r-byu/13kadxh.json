    "postText": "Does anybody else hate the 3 way stop southwest of campus near the tennis courts and brick oven? I believe it\u2019s 800N and 200E. I know a lot of people hate it because there\u2019s always tons of students and pedestrians but I\u2019m often turning left or right onto 800 and almost every single time a car just goes before their turn. And it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a pedestrian walking preventing me from driving, these drivers just either aren\u2019t paying attention or just don\u2019t care. It\u2019s so frustrating!",

It has the same amount of lanes as 700 but only takes you to 700e. Is everyone coming from off campus? I know the light at 700n and 400e sucks but it's not like waiting at the queue at the 3 way stop is faster. As a pedestrian I'm glad there are so many crossings.",

            "comment": "Yeah 800 N is designed to prioritize pedestrian and biking traffic. 700 N is designed to prioritize buses and cars. It is a part of the whole theory that to get the BYU one should take any other mode of transportation other than a car. That is partially why BYU transportation research lab worked so closely with UDOT to get the UVX going. They have plans to add other stops around Provo with the UVX. \n\nI agree the infrastructure in Provo is awful for cars. but that is because cars are not prioritized in the design. This is because the data UDOT has shows that most of the trips being taken are not with cars and so the city reacts accordingly.",

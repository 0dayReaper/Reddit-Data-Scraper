Here\u2019s my general plan:\n\nFALL:\n- GEOL 100: Dinosaurs \n- PSYCH 111: Introduction to Psychological Science\n- COMMS 101: Mass Comm &amp; Soc\n- Some sort of Civ 1 class\n\nWINTER:\n\n- ART 101: Intro to Art and Drawing  OR  ART 105: Intro to Ceramics\n- COMMS 230: Intro to Advertising \n- Some sort of Civ 2 class\n- Some sort of Biology class\n\nI\u2019m planning on getting most of my gen eds out of the way. Totally willing to switch things around or swap out classes. I wanted to know if this is a good workload or if any of it is too much. Also, does anyone have any suggestions for Civ 1 &amp; 2 and Biology? Science isn\u2019t my strong suit, and I\u2019m not planning to go into a career where it\u2019s necessary, so something easy would be preferable. Looking forward to being there! :)",

While I enjoyed astronomy (more than dinosaurs) it sucked to have to take two classes when I could've just taken the physical science class that would fulfill the whole requirement.",

It's not hard to get into/stay in, the classes are functionally the same, but it knocks out GEs faster.",

But, many majors have sequences of courses that have to be taken one after the other, and some can be 5-6 courses long (which means 5-6 semesters). If you spend 3-4 semesters \"getting GEs out of the way\", now you'll have to extend the time to graduate because the sequences of courses may force you to.\n2. Further, now the last three or so years of your major will be stuffed with major classes. This can easily be a terrible idea, especially if your major has a lot of time consuming classes. It will hurt your grades, it will hurt your mental health, and, above all, it will hurt you during your last year where you need to be spending time networking and applying for jobs (easily the single most important thing you can do as a college student and I am 100% not exaggerating, based on my experience as a recruiter)\n3. Ideally, you want to spread GEs across your time in school. For example, in my case (CS major), I took 2 CS classes + 1 time-consuming GE + 1 easy GE + 1 religion class or similar. This helped me pace the course sequences, it helped me graduate in time, it helped me pad semesters so none would be too heavy, and it allowed be to have time to apply for jobs and network.",

My Music 201 and 202 (I took one from each Professor that offers it) were easy As and were genuinely interesting classes.\n\nI've also had terribly boring GEs that made me glad I wasn't just taking that class. I'll be honest, most GEs for me were on this side of the spectrum.\n\nI think others are saying this same thing.",

After finishing my 2 prerequisite classes 2nd semester, I'll be able to apply for my desired major. All of the classes within that major build on each other, so there are no additional classes I need to take outside of what is already required. \n\nI've looked over the required classes, and I'll only need to take 1-2 communications-related classes a semester, leaving room for a religion class and electives. I totally hear the concern and doubts about taking so many gen eds my first year, but I've truly thought about it, and I believe it's my best course of action. \n\nAlso, I'm looking to take a very easy load this first semester for scholarship and student-life adjustment sake. I'm leaning towards GOEL 100, PHIL 201, CEL 120, and TMA 102. I will definitely be meeting with my advisor soon. \n\nThank you to all who have commented advise.

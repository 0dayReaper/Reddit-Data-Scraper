You'll have to run an ARM version of Windows as a Virtual Machine using Parallels or similar software (which sounds like a pain to be honest, you may be better off getting a Windows laptop).",

I also prefer apple products when possible, but if your major requires windows, it's just not worth it to try and run windows on Mac. Using a VM to run windows every day for a 4 year degree would be hell, and if you got an older Mac that allowed you to use boot camp, you'd be semi permanently cutting your computer storage in half. \n\nMy freshman year I did the whole dual boot thing on my Mac and it sucked. Macs are not made to run windows.",

From what I've experienced/heard, the main reasons to use Macs are:\n\n* They are Unix based, which means they can easily run anything Linux based. (The vast majority of the internet is Linux based) Unless you're developing professional apps or websites, however, I wouldn't say you fall into the category where this is a big deal.\n* Macs have great platform-specific software if you're into creative things like video editing and music writing. (I've had good experience with Logic Pro X)\n* iMessage, Facetime, and iCloud sync features if you have other apple products\n\nFrom what I've seen, the overwhelming majority of college students, even if they're in CS, will only ever be benefitted from that third bullet point. I can't imagine anyone would find it worth it to spend twice as much money for that.\n\nEdit: I will say that I did just type that from my Mac, but that's because I like to spend an obscene amount of money on computers. Don't be like me. Spend money on dates.",

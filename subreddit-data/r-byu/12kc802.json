            "comment": "Stayed in helaman halls 2 years ago. Honestly, the parking isn't as bad as people make it out to be. Yes, it is definitely easier to find a spot before ~10PM. However, unless it's like 3AM on a weekday, you can normally find spots. They might not always be right next to the building your child will be staying at, but they should be able to find something. If not, there is a parking lot right across the street that I used to park in overnight a lot; not sure if you're allowed to do that but I never got towed. In my opinion, the biggest worry I would have with my child having a car as a freshman would be that everyone asks them for rides and doesn't pay them gas money\ud83e\udd23 I would also agree that they will definitely want shower slides/a shower caddy. A power bank with multiple plugs was also a must for me when I was there.",

It's much easier to get around campus than with a car, parking permits are expensive, and parking is a nightmare on campus. If he needs to travel for the holidays there are plenty of resources to organize ride shares between students.",

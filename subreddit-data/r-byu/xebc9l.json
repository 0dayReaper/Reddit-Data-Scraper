We smuggled in his Xbox and a projector and played Star Wars Battlefront all night. The student janitor found us, watched for a few minutes, played a round, and left. I think I even passed my finals!",

The library plays really loud music at 11:45 pm to help kick everyone out in time for closing time at midnight. Taylor Swift, pop music, stuff like that. One time my roommate and I went to the library at 11:45 pm just to have a dance party in all the stairwells and all the floors of the library, dancing to that music. It was really punk rock, really fun. :) Simple fun.",

            "comment": "At BYU in the late 1990s I tagged along with a friend working overnight security. Busted a lot of couples in the HFAC piano rooms. LOTS of couples.  One night about 2 am, we walked up on a couple under a blanket on one of the hot air grates by the SWKT.  They tried to explain that they were married.  We told them to go home and bang!\n\nLast day at the dorms and people in DT (V Hall) were chucking whatever could fit through the slit opening in the windows onto the basketball court below.  One room was able to open their window all the way and people started throwing things into the pool.  We were able to get a gallon jug of milk over into the pool.\n\nOne of my Grounds Crew supervisors (married with kids) slept with one of the female student-workers on his crew. He got fired (of course) and the female student got to \"work\" in the grounds office doing homework for the rest of her time at BYU.\n\nAlso, flirting with a woman in class. Start casually dating, ask her to go with you to a concert a few weeks out... she gets engaged before the concert.",

                    "comment": "V-Hall which floor?   My roommate picked the lock on the window that prevented it from opening fully (5ft).  He then filed off the internal locking mechanism so that it would never latch again.  From then on anyone could just pull the bolt out and open the window all the way.  I wonder if you used that same window?",

            "comment": "Freshman year, me and some friends learned how to cash out our dining plus card using the vending machine\u2019s refund option. After months of doing it, we got summoned to the HC. They had a stack of paper showing every transaction/refund. They threatened to kick us out, but our Bishop came to our defense asking what we did wrong as we weren\u2019t stealing nor was there any signage that it was illegal. $1 was refunded and $1 was deducted from our balance. They argued that it was against the principle of the dining plan, but eventually had to admit that we had not broken the HC. \n\nThe next day, every vending machine on campus had signage that it was against the Honor Code for cashing out your Dining Plus card.",

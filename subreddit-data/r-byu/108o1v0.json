            "comment": "The \u201clab\u201d part of physics 105 is more like a scheduled TA lab. Every professor will run their lab a little bit differently, so I would be sure to ask the TA\u2019s how it works during your first lab. When I took it, lab was used to go over the homework and explain some extra concepts that we ran out of time for in lecture. I think I only  needed to be there to turn in the homework and I could go, but I ended up attending every lab since they were so helpful. To get credit for a physics lab, you\u2019ll want to take physics 107.",

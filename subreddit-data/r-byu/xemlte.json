But there's the catch-22 for mormon kids: whether you qualify for financial assistance is generally contingent on how much your parents make, but doesn't account for \"expenses\" in terms of \"voluntary\" religious donations, i.e. tithing, which means that mormon families are functionally poorer than they are on paper. The result? Mormon students often have *no options* outside of BYU.",

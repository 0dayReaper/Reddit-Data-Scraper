            "comment": "There\u2019s several issues with this. \nMost people and definitely current church leaders do not say to just \u201ctolerate\u201d LGBTQ individuals. It\u2019s to tolerate behavior. Most members don\u2019t LOVE homosexual behavior, so they tolerate it and still LOVE the individual. God does not love sin, he loves people. So if her statement was directed at members of the church, I think she mixed some things up, possibly on purpose to take a moral high ground. \n\nAlso, while you may think representing pride and marching etc for homosexuality, is just a demonstration of love. The reality is that most people see that as a support of the behavior. I think it\u2019s probably because that flag is used in movements that promote political advancements for more open definitions of marriage, religious privileges, and many more. Those things the church has taken obvious stands against. Members of the church typically don\u2019t wear that attire because it can send a message that you are supportive of the behavior and also the direction of the larger movement. It\u2019s naive to think that the only message it sends is love, and in some way represents Jesus and Christianity. \n\nThere are other ways to show love for gays that might not also send mixed messages and flirt with a political movement that has directly opposed the church and God\u2019s commandments. Anyways, just my thought when you said \u201cthese colors just mean love\u201d... for many it\u2019s larger than that.",

Jesus hung around and served the marginalized, loved everyone, and condemned judging. From experience, I have been hurt by parents saying I can never marry another man, and they wish I wasn't gay. It's created a deep fissure between us and has hurt me deeply.\n\nSo I agree. Voicing your religious beliefs and political opinions instead of just being happy for our LGBTQ brothers and sisters using God-given agency to try to live their best life is not love.",

I just mean it's bad to refers to Black people as \"the blacks.\"\n\nFrom what I've been told, using \"Black\" as an adjective is fine, but not as a noun. So you would say \"Black people need to be treated fairly\" instead of \"blacks need to be treated fairly.\" Using adjectives as nouns is typically done in a derogatory sense. \n\nI'm not Black, but I am gay. When people said \"the gays\" or \"gays\" in the past it was typically derogatory. There's been some movement to reclaim the word, but I wouldn't recommend using it unless you yourself are queer and are having fun with other queer people.\n\nHope this helps!",

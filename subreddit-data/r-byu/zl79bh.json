I have never been able to find articles or reports about what happened online and I\u2019d like to know more about this story from people rather then word of mouth.",

We do not want others on this campus to be contaminated by your presence.\"\n\n\"Contaminated by your presence\", oof. Did leadership ever apologize for that kind of incredibly hateful rhetoric, or is this more of a \"repentance for thee, but not for me\" kind of situation?",

They just removed the speech from the BYU sites and proceeded to pretend it doesn't exist.\n\nQueer students in the Church and BYU are frequently attacked with hateful messages which are later deleted, covered up, brushed under the rug, etc. Where we're then told that they didn't actually happen or we're making a big deal about something that happened a while ago.\n\nThere was a teacher here at BYU who called a gay student Korihor (one of the anti-christs in the book of mormon) on twitter. He wasn't even punished, he tweeted an apology and then buried it under a mountain of retweets of DezNat accounts(Deseret Nationalists, a utah based white supremacist hate group) and still teaches at BYU to this day in the religion department.\n\nMeanwhile teachers here have been fired for things as simple wearing a rainbow \"safe space\" pin to class (source: https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2022/02/14/byu-professor-says-she/)\n\nBYU only pretends to care about it's queer students to the point that it doesn't get it's accreditation revoked.",

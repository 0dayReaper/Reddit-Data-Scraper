    "postText": "I am a BYU alum and an Oregon fan. I was at the Oregon football game today in my Oregon gear next to the student section where the student section continually chanted \"fuck the mormons\" in unison.\n\nBeing LDS and an Oregon fan I found this to be unacceptable and actually very hostile. In fact its beyond slandering the opposing team or players which is expected at any sporting event. Why isnt this discrimination and bigotry making the news? I feel 90% percent of that student section doesnt even know what being mormon means.\n\nI also saw two students mocking missionaries and dressing up as them. I found that distasteful too.",

I didn't even know about the chant until I saw it on the news the day after.  I sat next to a very pleasant UO fan. He was very cordial and he showed good sportsmanship.  We chatted several times about the plays or the mascots during the game.  It was nice.  Honestly, the beatdown BYU got was the worst part of the day.  Oh, and the traffic backup on I-5 north for like 50 miles.  \n\nOverall, I would say my experience at Auzten stadium was positive. I've wanted to go to a game there for a while (Jonathan Stewart grew up in my same town).",

It's always a bit uncomfortable as a visiting fan, but people are generally nice.  \n\nInterestingly enough, I did hear the same chant by some WSU fans in the bathroom at Martin Stadium.  They started with \"F*ck the Huskies\", then remembered who they were playing and substituted in \"Mormons\" for \"Huskies\".",

The sexism, homophobia, racism, etc. ran rampant. I knew so many despairing women, pressured into having more kids than they could handle, made to feel like they must always be pretty and thin in order to be godly\u2026 oof.

Simply put, the Mormon church was formed during a time in US history when race was a hot topic. Smith said what needed to be heard to be liked and Young was a slave owning racist and didnt care what anyone thought. While the church today struggles to get away from this racist past and its racists doctrine, it cant. It is in its very foundation. It is embedded in the Book of Mormon (important of white skin and curse of dark skin) and has been a limit of salvation as of just a handful of decades ago.",

The simple fact is that BYU routinely discriminates against a number of protected classes as a matter of institutional policy:\n\n- Religion\n- Sexual orientation\n- Gender identity\n\nAnd historically they have discriminated against these additional protected classes:\n\n- Race\n- Sex\n\nIs that excused bigotry hilarious?\n\nOf course, all of this is legal^\u2020 in the United States because BYU is owned by a religion. But that doesn't change the fact that the the vast majority of discrimination against protected classes is coming from inside the ASB, not the student section of an opponent's stadium.\n\nI don't approve of the students actions on Saturday. But I think BYU could see those motes much better if their vision wasn't impaired by the beam in their eye.\n\n---\n^(\u2020 Not a lawyer, don't take legal advice from a reddit comment)",

There is a double standard, but it is self-imposed. BYU and the members it teaches can only expect to be hated by the world, and the world can only expect for the Church to be as near perfect and Christlike as possible. Remember to turn the other cheek and to offer forgiveness to those who trespass against you quickly. It sounds like The University of Oregon is doing it\u2019s part to correct the problem, and it is our place to forgive and forget.",

That said, I think U of O president should take every measure to identify as many as possible from video and ban them from games, and if they're not able to, eliminate the student section for the next home game. Make an example of this, that it is not tolerated. Sorry your community was subjected to this.",

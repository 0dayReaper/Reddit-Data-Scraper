I heard the same thing when I lived at Budge hall, but never got a straight answer for where and how. The most plausible answer was a grate on the north side of the building (never got an actual location) and could be opened with a wire hanger. Look at the map in the link.\n\nThe best entrance is on campus near the Marb.\n\nEdit: Okay, I mean best as most reliable entrance for anyone. Having a key card that gets you past locked doors to a \"best entrance\" is just using a key. For the MARB, there's a grate and vent to the west of the building. The vent can be moved and the ladder leads to a door to the substation. No special access to get to the entrance.",

Most are utility tunnels. Those are very dangerous. \n\n* Do not go in the utility tunnels. You will die.\n\n* BYU uses a central boiler to superheat a fluid that they pump to every building on campus. This fluid heats buildings and makes hot water.\n\n* BYU uses tunnels to carry wires and pipes, including the superheated fluid pipes. If these pipes overheat, a check valve can pop and blast you with scalding hot fluid.\n\n* Do not go in the utility tunnels.  You will die.\n\n* Most of the tunnels are only big enough to carry pipes and wires. There isn't enough room for a human to safely pass through them without getting stuck, burned, or crushed.\n\n* The tunnels are boring. There is nothing interesting to see. Ever see a pipe? Ever see a wire? Cool, you've seen inside the tunnel.\n\n* The few human-sized tunnels (like the HFAC, HBLL, etc) are safe to enter. But they are also pretty boring. The HFAC one is accessible to anybody from the second-to-bottom floor.  It's a loading dock for the stage. \n\n* One human-sized tunnel goes to a data center underneath the JFSB quad. The center backs up the church, BYU Idaho, and who know what else.  It is staffed with armed guards 24/7. Do not go in it.  You won't die.  But will meet a BYU PD officer very quickly.\n\n* If you want to stay alive... Do not go in the utility tunnels.  You will die.",

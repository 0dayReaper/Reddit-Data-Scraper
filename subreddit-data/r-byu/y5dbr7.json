It says on the application page on Indeed.com they require members to have temple recommends, however they also state they are equal opportunity employers and don't specify about it being a requirement. I imagine it's probably preferred I be Mormon, but considering I'd be cleaning toilets I'd assume they'd allow outsiders to help.",

While they were not required to convert they were required to live the standards of the church. Essentially they had to keep any of the dietary or behavioral laws which am LDS temple recommend holder would keep. This meant they were asked not to drink coffee or alcohol, they were expected to be married to their SO, they could not be actively in an LGBTQ+ relationship. This could go on but in short you have to live as if you were LDS. While the school has equal opportunity employment it also has a religious exemption which allows them to assert their employees maintain their standards. This requirement is only for non-student staff. If you are a student of another faith work requirements match honor code requirements rather than LDS temple requirements.",

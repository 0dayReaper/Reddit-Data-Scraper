I support every rule that has its roots in the principles of the Gospel but the beard ban is outdated at best and judgmental at worst.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, the ban supports unrighteous judgment among Latter-day Saints. I was asked if I\u2019ve lost my testimony when I grew a beard for the first time. It\u2019s ridiculous and needs to stop. It\u2019s a cultural problem that we need to end but BYU is working it\u2019s hardest to prevent that. I have a temple recommend, I\u2019m an RM, I teach primary, and I\u2019m married in the temple. I read my scriptures and pray day and night. I\u2019ve never been unworthy to take the sacrament in my whole life. But according to BYU, my choice to grow a beard makes me dishonorable. It\u2019s backwards.",

    "postText": "Hello all. I am a transfer student who was just accepted last Friday. While I had heard about the 2-semester on-campus/contracted housing requirement, I was hoping that only applied to freshmen. The emails I'm getting tell me otherwise, unfortunately...\n\nI'm in my mid-20s, but I'm an old fart at heart. Having attended 2 schools before BYU, I think I've had quite enough of the, uh *adventures* involved in living with freshmen &lt; 21 years of age.\n\nNormally I'd just go straight for any private-room contracts, but it seems that nearly all private bedroom floor-plans are exclusive to female only apartments for some reason. If I absolutely must share a bedroom with someone, could you guys advise me on which apartments are least likely to have freshmen or parents-paying-for-rent students in them? My price range is anything bellow $800 per month.\n\nEdit: Figured I'd give an update in case anyone finds this post again, and needs advice on getting exempt from the housing policy.\n\nI got an exception, but it was not easy. I pretty much had to petition 3 separate times before I got it. \n\nThe first 2 attempts were appealing to the purpose of the policy's existence. I was told it was enstated because studies show new students do much better academically when they are thrust into a controlled environment such as the on/contracted campus housing seeks to create. So, I explained that while it may be beneficial to the average student, I know from experience it does not benefit me.\n\nThat approach didn't get me anywhere, so I told them that I had ADHD, so therefore the crowded, privacy-starved environment of on/contracted housing would make studying and homework exceedingly difficult for someone like me. That worked,  but first they wanted me to prove it with an official diagnosis. I had to track down 20 year old medical records that were thankfully still archived after all this time.\n\nSo I guess the moral of this story is that if you want an exception to the housing policy, you better have your medical history handy.",

There's a Walmart and a bunch of restaurants within walking distance too.\n\n\nOtherwise, maybe look into the foreign student housing? Most people there tend to be a little older, they're all either foreign students, or students becoming language teachers.",

Lots of people stay here until graduation.\n\nThe Language Immersion Student Residence (previously Foreign Language Student Residence) is also a great option with very few freshman. It also has a great community if you're cool with the time requirements.",

There are a lot of apartments within walking distance to campus, especially on the South end. There are actually a lot of private rooms for both genders, and I think most will be under your budget.",

            "comment": "Congrats on getting accepted!\n\nI was a transfer student who came to BYU basically at the start of sophomore year. I never lived on campus (Heritage/Helaman Halls), but pretty much every apartment I lived in during undergrad was in or near that block of space between the south of campus edge (\"Rape Hill\"), University Avenue, Center Street, and 900 E.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a mature experience and are in your mid 20s, I would recommend getting to King Henry Apartments, which is slightly east of 900 E and is near the Taco Bell if that Taco Bell still exists. The Village is also reasonable. \n\nYou do also have the right to live in that apartment that is way northwest of BYU, almost near UVU/Orem\u2014I forget what it\u2019s called but it\u2019s this big sprawling complex that you\u2019ll eventually hear people mention. If you go south down State Street toward Springville, there are some apartments there where some mid 20s people live. It\u2019s kind of out of the way from my perspective but I mean there is a community there.\n\nGood luck. I was about 24 when I graduated, and I know people who were 25-28 when they finished BYU, as well as people at other schools who are 30-33 and still finishing or recently finished their bachelors.",

I live down the road from them (right by the Taco Bell that does, in fact, still exist, bless its soul), and it's one of the few off campus apartment complexes that retained its BYU approved status, making it a sort of \"destination\" housing for freshman. There's always a lot going on, but definitely not the mature experience you say.",

If you call the housing office and explain your situation (that's what I did anyhow), they are very forgiving. I was able to dodge the requirement.\n\n2) If you're still after a place, I'm looking to sell my contract. It's a male private room with a private bathroom, near(ish) parking, in-unit laundry, and on the top floor. $580 a month. The one snag is that it's about 15-20 minutes away from campus. Other than that, it's not a bad apartment. I don't know when you're planning on moving down here, but the apartment will be available in late April and with the contract expiring July 31st with the option to renew. Message if you're interested.",

The way they explained it to me is that they want to ensure that new freshmen and even new transfers are in a \"controlled environment\" where they can safely adjust to adulthood. The rule is less for \"well travelled\" folk like ourselves. If you call and explain that you've attended two universities already, they just might let you out of it. They did for me anyways",

I thunk in heritage you share the whole flat with 6 people so I'll take one roommate over 4 extra",

Like, that doesn't track because emotions aren't sinful, just what you do with it. Attraction can be dwelled on to become lust, for example. Another is that anger can be used as an indicator that something needs correction or it can be used to stir up strife. Disagreements don't have to be contentious.  \n\n\nAnother conversation I was part of was about the reasons for the church leaving Boy Scouts, and one guy said we didn't need gay people in troop leadership. I asked why, and he backtracked on it saying people back then just felt threatened with a bunch of changes happening, and then he doubled down on how it likely made sense in context. Like, if I was an 80 year old from the south defending the Jim Crow laws for separating whites and blacks by saying they made sense in context, I think anyone today would sideeye that one.  \n\n\nI don't know if there's a solution for these besides just keeping on having conversations like the above. On some level I think it's better to be articulate and wrong because it at least opens up the opportunity for correction.",

I think we\u2019d agree that we\u2019re set up for and chose the possibility of failure.\n\nIf failure is sin, I\u2019d agree with a reference to Paul on handling temptation in [1 Cor 10:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10?lang=eng&amp;id=p13#p13)\n\nIf failure is feeling excluded or called out at church by incorrect ideas or hurtful opinions, I\u2019d agree that God didn\u2019t set queer members up to fail. The other members did. [Ben Schilaty has a great blogpost touching on this](http://benschilaty.blogspot.com/2020/08/how-to-avoid-being-jerk-to-gay-people.html).\n\nIf failure is a setback, then I\u2019d reference [Wrong Roads](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/2005/07/wrong-roads-and-revelation?lang=eng)  quoted by Elder Holland who said we can be led down a wrong road to find revelation or confirmation of somewhere else to go.\n\nIf failure is unfairness, [Renlund\u2019s Infuriating Unfairness](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/04/25renlund?lang=eng)  covers this pretty well in how Christ can help us not be bitter. I think that this can also be reduced to an equity versus equality argument, which I believe many people argue in circles over because they don\u2019t nail down the difference between opportunity and outcome in a given context.\n\n\\- - -\n\nThere are lots of meanings of failure, but what is success then? Is it exaltation through marrying someone a person has no physical attraction to? Is it being faithful to the endowment through living a celibate life, and if so, what is the outcome in the next life?\n\nWould success involve being cured of same sex attraction? I think that unfairly pathologizes it, and just teaches people to unnecessarily hate a part of themselves. [Wordly attempts at curing it have been discussed elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/xfvp6h/why_was_i_never_told_that_byu_used_electroshock/). I imagine there are many feelings we wouldn\u2019t feel as resurrected, perfected beings, like worldly sorrow instead of godly sorrow, but why would that include same sex attraction?\n\nIf anything I think acknowledging our same sex attraction can strengthen our divine identity, like [when Elder Ballard said \"Our spiritual identity is enhanced as we understand our many mortal identities, including ethnic, cultural, or national heritage.\"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/04/28ballard?lang=eng&amp;id=p15#p15)",

Also the fact of the matter of how I have a trans roommate, but she needs to be in dorms based on her birth assigned gender, is officially referred to as he/him, still referred to as her dead name despite changing it in my.byu, etc.\n\nThe barriers are from the lack of acceptance. Yes, we can exist on campus, but as soon as we \"act on it\" it's bad. There's no Title IX support because, as Oaks proudly said at the devotional, BYU is exempt from that portion of the policy.",

Straight people just get to exist, but we're a problem to be solved. \n\n I'm no longer a student but I stayed in Provo after I got married. For a while, I was still active but my wife wasn't. My bishop was very insistent that I *never talk about my wife.* The fact that I was gay was too divisive. Someone brought up fishing, and I couldn't share a story about my wife taking me fishing for the first time. Someone asked what my husband does, and I couldn't correct them. Have you ever tried to go a time without ever mentioning your partner's name or gender, not even a pronoun? Knowing that of you slipped up, it could mean possibly losing your membership in the Church?\n\n It's wild to me that a man can get up in testimony meeting and talk about how he and his wife struggle with infertility and no one cares. But if I introduce myself to someone before Sunday school and say \"I met my wife at BYU, we're both RMs, we've been married X years,\" suddenly no one can think about Jesus anymore I guess because everyone is thinking about gay sex now or something.\n\n We're totally written out of doctrine. According to the current understanding of doctrine, the only people living with God in the Celestial kingdom will be straight cis men and their one or more wives. At BYU where marriage and dating is such a big part of the culture, that doctrine bleeds into everything, especially in how we're talked about then treated. The fact is when you're queer at BYU, you're a target for people who are hostile, and those who are supposed to be there to protect you are too busy scrutinizing you and judging you to come up with solutions, so you can't trust them.\n\n It's just the general unsafe feeling of knowing that you're so unwanted that no one even believes God would ever let you into heaven. Not unless I'm \"cured\" from my relationship with my wife, forced to marry a guy and watch her married to some dude, having to repent of all the love and care I've given her in this life, and having our (future, we hope) children taken and sealed to another couple who's more worthy just because they were straight in this life. And when I have a problem with that, I'm just a faithless angry gay, and members would rather write me off because that's easier than mourning with me and maybe doing something about it. It's the gaslighting that if I just prayed more, I wouldn't feel sad about losing the woman I love in the next life. It's the constant abandonment in this weird, uncomfortable space by people who say they love me.",

Basically you wear rainbow things to show LGBTQ students that they are welcome and loved. Last year on that day, a group organized a sort of protest against it. They told everyone to carry around an umbrella and wear BYU gear to \"show support of the family proclamation and BYU\" or something like that. It was really depressing to see how many people were carrying around umbrellas that day (not rainy at all so it was easy to tell.) Just a month or so ago a student pride organization held a drag show (pretty sure that wasn't campus sponsored) and protesters showed up with some pretty awful signs. I heard some had guns but I for sure have not confirmed that. There's also a lot of really mean things that go on in online spaces like twitter.

For my field, at least, BYU is a well-respected undergraduate institution. \n\nGranted, this is one impression from one student of a single (albeit broad) discipline.

But once you're working with a team and the manager realizes you don't work well people that don't look like you it can become a liability. And the thing is it's not always willful ignorance like the response above. If you're in a BYU STEM program you are surrounded by white men. You're simply not exposed to other people or cultures so you may not have the opportunity to develop certain people skills that are essential in the world outside of Utah County. \n\nI've had several interviews where I've had to qualify my BYU experience by pointing out I also took sociology classes on race, gender, etc, and was heavily involved in activism my last 2 years. In a lot of nonprofit spaces especially, BYU grads are not well respected and with good reason imo. If your nonprofit mission has anything to do with human rights it's not unreasonable to assume that a BYU alum harbors homophobic ideas that are incompatible with your organization's work.",

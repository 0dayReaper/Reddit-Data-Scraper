Looking to find out which off campus housing complexes have elevators. Not all the websites are clear. This is a really important question for me so any help is greatly appreciated!",

Indoor access apartment buildings I believe are required to have an elevator.\n\nOnes that come to mind as possibilities are Alpine village, the Village, CollegePlace.\n\nIn Orem by UVU, I believe wolverine crossing and similar would also",

The company is fairly new I think so they don't have all of the data (collected through resident reviews) but they list quite a few that have elevators so it's worth a look. Good luck!\n\nedit: wanted to add that this site does monthly raffles too. I just won a $100 Amazon Gift Card for completing a review (they had 5 winners last month). I'm guessing not a lot of people do it so odds are high :))",

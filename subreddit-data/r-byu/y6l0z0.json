It also included a lot of stretching and just some normal bodyweight exercises. I'd say it leans slightly more towards glorified stretching than it does CrossFit.",

            "comment": "I would say when I took it, it was like weightlifting prep, CrossFit, and a stretching class all at once. They teach proper form for lifting and power application. They have stretching and things like that, but most days were exercise days after the first two weeks. There were some days that we did a lot of range of motion stuff and stretching, but it was mostly CrossFit style exercise. That might vary by instructor.",

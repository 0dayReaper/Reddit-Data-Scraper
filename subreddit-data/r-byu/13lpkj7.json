If you are not far-right, you will not get a good grade no matter how well you wright or study. I can't believe the kinds of things he said or inferred in class.",

This isn\u2019t light reading and there\u2019s a lot of it, but the best way to be successful is by trying to understand the material as many times as you can. \n\nYou get your first chance the first time you read the material, then another during class, then another during homework. If you skip one chance it\u2019ll be noticeable and you\u2019re grade will reflect it. If you feel like you\u2019re just not getting the material after reading it and going to class, then before you do the homework go to the TA hours. Speaking as a TA I loved talking to students about the material and helping them figure it out. \n\nThe last piece to be successful is writing. I know Hancock had a specific style of writing for his homework assignments, so I recommend you go to the TAs for your first assignment to make sure you get it right. I don\u2019t know how he handles term papers, but they were pretty significant for 201 in my time. About 70-80% of the term papers was properly understanding the material, once again. Don\u2019t ask your TAs to pre-grade the paper(s), but if you ask them to check for style/grammar mistakes it can help save a few points. We were only allowed to edit one paragraph for a student before they turned it in, so there\u2019s likely to be some kind of limit, but it still can basically amount to an easy boost in grade. \n\nI loved these classes, and for me getting an A was easy because I like the material so much. So, it\u2019s not necessarily gonna be a super hard class, but it will definitely require consistent work.",

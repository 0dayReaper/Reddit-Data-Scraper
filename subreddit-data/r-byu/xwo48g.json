    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am a senior and next semester will be my last one. I still have to complete the GE for physical science and I want to know if any of you have taken PHYS 100 on-demand delivery (online). How hard is it compared to the in person class? I luckily have to only take 12 credits but I will be taking 2 heavy classes for my major (Finance). \n\nI am good at math and I honestly do not have the motivation to sit in a science class 3 times a week, plus the lab. I am nervous for the reviews from rate my professor. They only say that the online version of this class is very hard. How true is this?\n\nThank you!",

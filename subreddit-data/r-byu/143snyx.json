I got As in both and 205 wasn\u2019t really a stressful class since I still felt like I was challenged with grammar and speaking.\n\nI probably would have been okay to do 206, but I was definitely NOT prepared for 321 yet. Most of the folks in my 205 class had similarly taken 4-5 years of Spanish in high school, often including AP or dual credit. If you\u2019re feeling confident about 206, I\u2019d say go for it, but expect it to be a bit challenging.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone!! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc4b\n\nAs part of my senior capstone project, I am studying the effects of health literacy on vaccine hesitancy among college students aged 18-24 years. If you agree to participate, you will complete a survey asking questions about your views on the Covid-19 vaccine and a short vaccine literacy assessment. The survey should take 5-10 minutes to complete.  \n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed it, feel free to copy the link and send it to anyone else you know between the ages of 18-24 to take or share this post! Thank you so much for your time!! All response are greatly appreciated!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\nHere\u2019s the link: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5iWT1ml6YZCeUAiPB6opDOfD7oDGn_kpzNLzpGtidbik8pg/viewform?usp=sf_link",

It's hard to pin down concretely what exactly didn't sit right, but it feels like you may be fishing for a specific answer. \n\nOne thing in specific is that you only ask who is the most trusted source of information (doctor, family, etc.) and do not go beyond that to see how important each of those levels are, or allow more than one. My apologies, but it could be more comprehensive, or at least streamlined in how the questions are answered.\n\nI got the vaccine but do not fault any who choose not to. A widow in my home ward's husband died from cancer from Agent Orange in Vietnam, which leaders assured him was safe at the time. If someone is skeptical and nervous and was willing to be careful, there is nothing that should make them get the vaccine. \n\nI chose to get it to decrease the chance of me spreading it. Though I felt there was a chance of side effects I felt it was worth it. There is some data on potential long-term effects.",

My goal with the survey question you presented is to understand what influences college students health decisions the most if they had to choose, which is why I only allowed for one selection. But I do understand what you are saying as well. My overall goal is to see how the health literacy of college students is related to vaccination decisions. I have no intentions of fishing for a specific answer, just simply trying to understand why some people want it and some people don\u2019t at this age level and what are some influences into that making that decision. There\u2019s no right or wrong answer. \n\nHowever, I do appreciate the feedback and I will be sure to take it into consideration for future projects! Thank you for the change of perspective!",

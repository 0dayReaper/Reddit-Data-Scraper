I'd rather be engaged and excited for a class I didn't have an interest in than try to spite my way through the semester with a professor that sucks. \n\nI had Dr. Cooper for a Phil class. I think he teaches 210. Little hw, but a few paper by the end of the semester that can be started immediately. Very good lectures.",

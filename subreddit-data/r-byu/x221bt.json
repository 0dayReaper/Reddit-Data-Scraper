    "postText": "So I have an evening guitar class from 6-6:50 in the HFAC, but I have work at the MTC starting at 7:10 those same days. I was wondering what would be the best parking lot to park in without paying at that time. Preferably close to the HFAC and/or near 900E. Thanks for the recommendations!",

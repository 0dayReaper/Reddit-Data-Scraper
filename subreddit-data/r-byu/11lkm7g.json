    "postText": "Hi! \n\nI am the founder of a EdTech startup that I launched last year. \n\nWhile I have over a decade of corporate sales experience, onboarding a sales team that sells directly to customers has been new to me. I read a few funny posts on sales forums talking about how incredible LDS members are at sales. That's where I learned about this whole Summer Sales phenomenon.\n\nIt sounds like these pest-control / Solar panel companies are pretty unscrupulous so I was curious if there was still an appetite from students to work in commission based sales roles over the summer.\n\nI was thinking of maybe testing it out this year and seeing if BYU students are any good at selling our service to clients. \n\nMy questions for anyone with experience or knowledge of summer sales.\n\n1. Is Summer Sales really a thing? lol\n2. Assuming it is, are people actually interested in it or is it more of a joke?\n3. Any idea what people actually make selling over the summer? We have what I believe to be a pretty competitive commission structure but nothing close to \"Make $250k selling solar panels for 8 weeks\".\n4. Would BYU students be opposed to working with people (my cofounders and I) who are not LDS members? Be warned, I do have a beard so please brace yourselves emotionally and spiritually. :D\n\nThanks for any and all insights!",

A lot of us treat it like a joke, but a lot of people take it seriously. Lots of business school bros are into it.\n\n3. I've heard horror stories of people getting ripped off. However, my one close friend that did it told me he made around $30k, which he said was kinda average or maybe a little above average. $100k is a really good salesman working insane hours. A big problem is that they're often run like MLMs, which leaves the newer kids with a bad deal.\n\n4. I'm certain that no one would care about the religion (or beards) of the company. You'll definitely find that many of your hires are reluctant to follow BYU rules as is, lol. \n\nIf you do come recruiting, I would make sure to find out what the other companies (Aptive, Vivint, et al) are offering, and try to do better and not to take advantage of the hirees so much.",

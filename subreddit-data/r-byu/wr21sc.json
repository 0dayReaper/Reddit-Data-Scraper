    "postText": "In recent years, BYU has been the subject of an increasing degree of social scrutiny revolving around its official stance on social issues and its affiliation with the LDS church.\n\nWhile increased media attention and sustained critiques regarding conservative stances on social issues have caused a PR nightmare for BYU's administration, one less acknowledged point of secular judgment stems from BYU's rigid and seemingly arbitrary enforcement of the beard ban.\n\nWhile the beard ban once served the purpose of discouraging anti-authoritarian protests in the 60s and 70s, nowadays the meaning of the beard ban has faded into obscurity. Instead of serving any apparent social cause, the beard ban seems to be enforced as a matter of tradition. Although beards have no negative connotation in contemporary society (indeed, they may have a positive connotation), BYU has continued to enforce the ban as a matter of principle.\n\nWhile it is entirely within BYU's rights to enforce such a ban, I suspect that by doing so, they inadvertently cast a bad light on the University as well as its sponsoring organization the LDS church. To outsiders, the continued enforcement of a 1960's dress code seems to denote a spirit of rigidity and inflexibility that permeates BYU's administration. The inability of BYU's policy to update to better accommodate contemporary social norms and grooming trends reeks of arbitrarity and dogmatism.\n\nAs the outward-facing academic institution of the LDS Church, the beard ban raises questions regarding the Church's ability to cope with similar trends on a global scale. That is, can the Church adapt and grow to meet the needs of a new generation, or, like BYU, will it stay rooted in arbitrary traditions and dogmatisms that have arisen from a previous time? If the beard ban were rooted in LDS theology, then I suspect there would be good grounds for maintaining a beard ban on campus. But, given that the original justifications for the ban have faded into obsolescence, all that remains is a shadow of BYU's (and possibly the LDS Church's) resistance to change, commitment to another generation's social norms, and a failure to update to the current needs of the modern world.",

            "comment": "I suspect the beard policy could be quickly changed if a large enough segment of the student body simply refused to shave. Unlike other unpopular policies, there's no doctrinal basis for it. 1000 students standing in line at the testing center during finals being denied tests would force the administration to either cave, or make a lot of unpopular headlines. But like most campaigns of this nature, it comes down to a game of chicken. They can ignore 100 people, but not 10,000. Once the movement hit a critical mass, it would win.\n\nThe problem, of course, is getting that critical mass. I think the reason such a trivial issue hasn't come to a head until now is exactly that it is so trivial. We all recognize that the policy is ridiculous, but it's trivial enough that it's not really worth risking all that much to protest. LGBTQ issues are far more worthy of protest, but also a much harder hill to climb.\n\nFor my part, I haven't been clean shaven in 15 years. If I ever become a billionaire I'll offer them some money contingent on ending the beard ban. Short of that, I don't know what I can do. (I stand a better chance of becoming a billionaire than becoming president of the university!)",

Now that beards and long hair on men are not part of the counterculture, we look like idiots. Maybe we shouldn't have given the counterculture so much influence on campus.\n3.

I was talking about how the military enforces similar standards but their implementation is very different. I believe that BYU should be significantly less affiliated with the church. As it is they use the religious tie to justify rigidity in their policy and culture. I'm working to make a club at BYU that is a mini think tank and would be interested to try and draft a proposal to suggest solutions to this issue. I also really like that you take the perspective of what this looks like to those outside, which is often a neglected aspect of the issue. Often even if the policy makes sense in a bubble it's hard to implement with opposition in the real world. Ironically, the church catches more flak from within the church than outside of the church. Most articles that surface about this sort of stuff are written by ex members, which I think also says something about how church \"rules\" are enforced within the church. Anyways it's a complex issue, but it would 100% be interesting to look at because it's a small enough issue that there's maybe a chance of actually tackling it.",

No one makes fun of the military, and the military implements their policies well. BYU on the other hand implements this policy *extremely* poorly, in effect they use the dress and grooming standards as a barrier saying \"if **you** aren't willing to abide by our standards then **you** aren't good enough and should go somewhere else\" alternatively the message is \"this is the price **you** pay for being at this school where tuition is cheaper than almost anywhere else\". What they *should* be saying is \"**we** care about the impression **we** as a school and individuals make, and **we** have a sense of pride in this standard being upheld and **us** standing apart from others\". This changes the message from one of exclusion to one of unity if you choose to be a part of it. A lot of this depends on perspective though. Because I'm sure the administration who are for this policy (who are few and far between if you ask them what they think) imagine this policy brings unity and pride, but the implementation is poor.",

If you watch when upper church leadership comes to speak at BYU, they fight against the secular and push the spiritual. I just don't think they care much about what you're saying and until one of them shows up with a beard at General Conference, it's probably just not happening. \n\nI could possibly see the policy changing to allow male missionaries to have them at the same time, but other than those two examples, I just don't see it changing randomly.\n\nThe stigmatism around beards has not fallen into obsolence because a large enough portion of members view shaving as following upper church leadership, the example of the prophets. The priesthood calling of 'Elder' still requires you to be clean-shaven. I'm guessing your 'data' around the perception of beards doesn't include actual church leadership of influence, i.e. Area Authorities and above. Bishops and State Presidents are a dime a dozen, same with BYU faculty, they just don't count really.\n\nBYU is still a private church school regardless of the academics and desire to secularize it. As long as the first presidency and apostles sit on the board of directors, it will most likely keep a rigorous honor code that prepares  freshmen, especially males, with easy transition into missionary work and temple covenant making, e.g. the wearing of the temple garment.",

They care that LGBTQ people are given equal rights, treated with respect and allowed self-expression, so almost any university would be better. Many schools, particularly the Marriott school HEAVILY manages relationships with recruiting companies. Refusing to come and recruit or work with the Marriott school, especially when you say why, can have a big impact. Those schools rely on recruitment and placements to rank nationally and if enough companies start backing out it will make waves. \n\nAnother example would probably be the law school.",

            "comment": "Some info I have gleaned from friends in the Black Student Union the majority of Black men on campus have beard cards because of the natural tendency that daily shaving has to cause tightly curled hair to become in grown. The health center practically hands them out to black male students because if this but it does require that unlike the majority of the white males on campus black men going to BYU have to get extra permission to \u201cbe themselves\u201d on campus. Yes many African cultures take care of this by plucking/pulling out facial hair but in general this isn\u2019t a practice among black men in America. \n\nOn this level the beard rule is another othering factor that tells black men attending BYU that you don\u2019t really belong here. There are many black students who endure the challenge of the honor code grooming for educational reasons and trying to show their faith but as we are commanded not to be a stumbling block for our brethren the beard rule and honor code rules about \u201cextreme\u201d hair styles are an antiquated set of rules which disadvantage students at BYU who fall outside of standards that were put in place when BYU was whiter that it is now. \n\nAt its heart the honor code grooming standards as written are one of these institutional standards which make it harder to be black at BYU. I won\u2019t say out of malice but out of ignorance by perpetuating grooming standards popularized in the 1950s business settings. Standards which were by and large white and ignorant of physiology of non-white hair care and health standards. \n\nAs BYU Black students already struggle with acceptance on campus from both the open racism which has appeared on campus and the subtle othering from there non-black peers anything that can be done to make them feel more comfortable at BYU is not merely a social justice type thing but a spiritual concern as these brothers and sisters experience at the school seems to be pushing them away from the community of the saint. \n\nPerhaps that sounds non-spiritual or secular in ins concern but requiring someone to take extra steps to fit in at BYU and even give proof that they have permission to be themselves does not seem like something the Savior would promote in his message of love and redemption.",

It sounds like you are othering in the sense that you are making out a group that they can't meet the same standards as their peers.

I am a member myself, and at bottom, I would love to see the Church continue to grow into a healthy and well-rounded organization capable of serving the needs of the rising generations. Little issues like the beard policy, however, give me concern--although, there are far greater issues that give me even more concern. It is just BYU's unresponsiveness to these little issues that make me worry about their responsiveness to greater issues.  \n\n\nBut I am very aware that other universities have their own dress codes and policies. While I do not agree with BYU's beard code, I am still grateful that they have the ability to enact these sorts of policies.",

Reviewing some of my friends research papers recently has gotten me into the mindset of removing all fluff possible and making it as simple as we can considering the complex subject matter. But this isn't a research paper on scatterometry.\n\nThat's a fair concern. Sorry, I was under the impression you were an exmormon with how much you seemed to hang around there.

However, some engineering dudes in my classes don't have good personal hygiene. And if they aren't required to shave anymore I don't see their personal hygiene improving. Not saying that's justification for the ban, just a potential aftereffect to note.\n\nThe rule in general is kind of silly though. I just imagine lots of guys would grow it out immediately when it's lifted, either to try it out or just out of laziness.",

            "comment": "I've been relieved to find a number of universities in America that have similar standards to BYU.  There's also another university called Hillsdale College that has an honour code and they literally call it an honour code!  I thought BYU was the only university to have that.  I say this to hopefully show BYU students and others that they are not the only ones and perhaps to not feel ashamed if they do about it.  I recall hearing Elder Oaks speaking about beards and the political statement it was in the 60's and 70's and it may not have the same meaning now but the beard still carries a personal statement.    \n\n\nThe beards I see most now are the machismo beards, which are very much a personal and political statement.  Do you approve of that kind of beard and the statement it makes?  The other personal statement is just not shaving someone can't be bothered.  Instead of the well groomed beard you just have a bunch of men with unsightly facial hair that would be better shaved.  There's a lot of stress at school and some might argue that having to shave every morning is just another burden but I think it is more about discipline and I think the discipline learned in shaving every day is of more use than abandoning the beard ban.    \n\n\nI would also argue that a beard is not a \"need of the modern world.\"  The modern world needs more disciplined men, more refined men and a clean shave is a personal statement of that.  There should be a campus barber, an old school barber with a cut throat razor, a hot steaming towel on the face, and an expert to do the job.  This is when the shave becomes therapy and not a chore.  It is a moment for the man to chill, equivalent to a woman's pedicure or manicure.  Men used to do that all the time.  Now we spend more time complaining about not having beards and thinking that your average joe will be concerned that a school has policies and that those policies will reflect negatively on a church.  I don't think people care and I think most people that are unhappy with the ban see that the benefits of BYU outweigh the discomforts of having to shave.",

You think you will get beautiful full beards, when likely for most men you will get unsightly stubble.  If it is about personal freedom to come and go as you please, for a person to just come and go as they please then I get that point.  What is the big deal, it is just a beard?  I suppose.  \n\nI will express my personal view and hopefully that helps you understand.  I see shaving as a way of showing discipline,  a way of taming the wildness of myself. It's a symbolic thing for me.  I support a clean shaven policy because it matches my personal ideals and values. \n\nBYU is not a context to consider your point about a policy against beards being harmful to missionary work.  Wards and branches across the world are those places where you come and go as you please shaved or not, bearded or not. That's where missionary work happens and is unaffected by a policy at BYU to shave.  Anyone who attends BYU, most likely a member to get a discount on tuition, understands the rules and want the benefits of the University and I'm sure they are ok to  shave for those benefits.  \n\nA worse look for those at BYU I think are the student activists who agree to follow one thing to attend but then protest what they agreed to follow.  Or the parting graduate who waves rainbows under their gowns or uses a speech to voice their personal views they know is contrary to the views of the university and to the people that sponsor the university and subsidise the learning of these very same activists.",

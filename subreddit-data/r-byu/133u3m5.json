College has so many more options for topics of learning, resources for learning about career opportunities, and just things you\u2019ve never even heard about. So go into college with an open mind at first to try and find something that really excites you and then go forward from there with what you commit to majoring in",

The only \u201ccollege visit\u201d was EFY, and that doesn\u2019t count. \n\nI had actually chosen to defer a semester and go to my local community college. I wasn\u2019t ready to leave home, and there were some classes there I wanted to take that weren\u2019t offered at BYU. That was a good decision for me, and I had a great semester. \n\nA lot of good things happened at BYU too, and I had a lot of great experiences. I met my wife my first day in Provo. So I don\u2019t necessarily regret going. \n\nThere were just a combination of factors that made it such a hard educational environment - I got married the semester after my mission. I took on way too many church and work responsibilities. I couldn\u2019t or DIDN\u2019T make school my top priority.\n\nI think if I could say anything to High School Me, it would just be to really take time to look at and apply for other schools. Take time to get really serious about what I can and can\u2019t handle in an academic environment. BYU is a good school, but that didn\u2019t mean it was the best school or the right school for me. And I would really strongly encourage High School Me to not get caught up on it being a church school and just look for the best environment for ME.",

Because upper class has more freedom, and they might have time for education that is not from the church, which can help them escape. \n\nThe median salary for the degrees I listed is $39,000 per year. That is NOT middle class. Also, some of the degrees they offer lead to upper class lives (programming, doctor, law, etc) so if the church wants people to be middle class, a lot of BYU's degrees shoot too high or too low.\n\n&gt;They want people \u201chappy\u201d but stuck a little. They want people to think happiness comes from being a member of The church. \n\nHow does capping income accomplish this? If people are poor enough to where they need church welfare, then the church doesn't make money off of them.\n\n&gt;They are happy with women in the useless majors so they reliant on their husbands. Putting more pressure on the woman to get really into keeping her husband dedicated to the church and not get any time away from her. \n\nThat would be a massive (and stupid) risk. If the husband leaves the church, there goes tithing for two people. Men also leave the church at higher rates than women. Furthermore, some of the useless majors are male dominated.\n\n&gt;For some people, it works. But you can\u2019t call BYU cheap when you look at the true cost. \n\nWhat is the \"true cost?\" Having to obey the word of wisdom and law of chastity for four years? Seems like a good way to avoid health problems and children born out of wedlock.\n\n&gt;For moral people, the fact that it is partially funded by tithing from third world countries should tell you the church is not just a business, but a very sick one.\n\nBYU has an online program that allows people from those third world countries to obtain a useful bachelor's degree for only $1500 BEFORE scholarships and financial aid. ($375 per year) I bet the church makes a massive profit off of doing that! /s",

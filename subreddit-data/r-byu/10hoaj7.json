I\u2019m taking CELL 220 this semester, and was wondering if anyone here has taken the class and has tips on how to do well (especially with the lecture portion and on the lab quizzes)? I\u2019m not 100% confident navigating the class yet, so any advice would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "The lecture exams are always much easier and tend to be pretty easy in general as long as you know the slides. The exams tend to be made directly from those. \n\nThe labs are a little more difficult but as long as you visit the free lab frequently and use the specimen they provide you should be good. Lots of memorization but take advantage of extra class time as well to teach your classmates and practice. Quizlets are super helpful and apps like 3Danatomy atlas to memorize bones and muscles.",

Make sure you study the study objectives. Best of luck! (I'm just trying to be realistic with you it is so difficult).",

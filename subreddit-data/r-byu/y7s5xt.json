    "postText": "UPDATE:\n\nEnd of the winter semester for 2023. I got an A- in PHSCS 121, B+ in A HTG 100, and MATH 113 is so far behind in grading that I have no idea what I have.\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know: PHSCS is physics, A HTG 100 is American Heritage, and MATH 113 is calculus 2.\n\nOverall, I think I did okay for calculus 2.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nI am a sophomore taking MATH 113, PHSCS 121, and A HTG (calculus 2, physics: intro to Newtonian mechanics, American heritage) during the winter semester. \n\nI also plan on taking some fun classes like bowling, self-defense, indoor cycling or music 113. And yes, I am taking mission prep for my religion class.\n\nIn your experience, will I be slammed with so much work? Am I biting off more than I can chew?\n\nJust want to make sure I survive and have a social life. I plan on working 15-20 hours as well. \n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: thanks guys for all the advice and answers given! Mainly I\u2019m worried about physics. I took AP in high school but she was very abusive and did not teach the class. No curves were given either. Asking for help was impossible.\n\nWays she was abusive:\n- activity called out and verbally abused students while in class.\n- failed students out of the class if she didn\u2019t like them. Also so she got the most students who got 5s on the exam in Texas.\n- abandoned her students several weeks before the AP test. Students didn\u2019t hear from her again until AFTER the exam. \n- humiliated students by making them teach the class, then pointing out every single thing they got wrong and taught the class after that. Proceeded to call the student out for the entire lecture.\n- when the students didn\u2019t know or understand a certain subject, pop quiz time! Then she refused to actually teach the subject and belittle the students for \u201cnot working hard enough\u201d.\n\nAnd yes, she was fired.\n\nI\u2019m worried because I didn\u2019t do so well in the class. Got a B as my overall grade. But obviously this hurt my self esteem greatly. I still have nightmares about this class.",

There are a handful of people here telling you that PHSCS 121 + MATH 113 are impossible together, but the reality is that you'll be forced to take an unfortunate combination of classes at some point in your degree. Be glad it's those two rather than CS 240 and pretty much anything else.",

I transcribed for American Heritage and I think it gets a worse reputation than it deserves. I found the lectures interesting, but there is a lot of reading and writing. I think it's seen as so difficult because many freshmen take it and don't realize it's pretty much a typical 100/200-level college course. I'm in self-defense right now with Coach Pease and it's helping me feel much more confident, and the only homework is watching a short video for each class. The hardest part is that it's at 8 am. I haven't taken music 113, but I did have to drop the advanced organ class because it was taking up way too much time--some electives can be deceiving like that. This is also my first semester working 20 hours a week as a TA and transcriber and even as a senior, it's knocked me on my butt with how much time that really takes up. Basically, try to have realistic expectations and use past experiences and your best judgment to determine how much you can reasonably handle. Good luck!",

Find a good professor who is clear to understand.  Read the chapter before class. Try to do some of the homework using the examples. Make notes where you get stuck. Then when you go to class, ask specific answers of how you are stuck.\n\nThe Stewart Calculus book is very well written. The examples will be helpful. \n\nIt's a time consuming process. There's a lot of memorizing identities and trig wheel stuff.  You can do it, but it'll probably consume 20+ hours a week (unless you are naturally brilliant at math).\n\nI'd say it's twice as difficult as Math 112, which was pretty straightforward.",

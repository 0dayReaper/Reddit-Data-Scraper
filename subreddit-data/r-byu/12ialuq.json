All the pick up places have salads which are nice. The Canon centers salad bar also is great. \n\nThe big secret though is variety of diet. Don\u2019t get stuck on eating the same thing everyday but vary your diet. Even it out with more vegetables. If you have questions there is free nutritional consultation available from dietary science students in the canon center a few times a week. They can help you change things up.",

They sell Mediterranean style bowls, but it\u2019s on the pricier side of on campus food.\n\nSome of the vending machine wraps are tasty and healthy! If you\u2019re a protein kind of person, I know the Blue Line in the Tanner Building sells fair life protein shakes.",

            "comment": "Jamba Juice can be healthy but you have to pick the right things. Some of the smoothies have sherbet or lots of juice in them. Pick ones that are under 500 calories and have a protein boost like Greek yogurt. I also like their bowls as you get some non-blended fruit and most have a good amount of protein. They also have steel cut oats which is a great whole grain.\n\nActually, this principle applies to most restaurants. If you order the right thing, you can eat fairly healthy most places. My trick is to use the website \"Eat This, Not That\" to look up ideas for national chains. For example, here's some Taco Bell ideas:\nhttps://www.eatthis.com/healthy-taco-bell-menu-items/\n\nIf it isn't listed on Eat This, you can try applying these principles:\n- Get something that is high in protein (meat, eggs, Greek yogurt, tofu, etc) and includes produce of some kind (potatoes and corn do not count)\n- Avoid things with lots of cheese, with more than one source of carbs (you don't need rice *and* a tortilla), or anything fried.\n- Substitute low calorie condiments like ketchup and mustard for high calorie ones like mayo, oil, and cheesy sauces.\n- Shoot for around 500 calories per meal. Most places have nutrition facts available online.",

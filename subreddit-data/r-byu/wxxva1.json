So, the farther away you get from campus and the more you stay away from housing oriented toward students, the older the people tend to be. Or, just move to Vineyard, which it seems like all my friends who graduated but wanted to stay in the area did.",

As a consequence, Millrace has a lot less transition year to year than other places, and longevity helps bring a feeling of maturity to the area, if that makes sense.\n\nI enjoyed my time (1 year) living there.",

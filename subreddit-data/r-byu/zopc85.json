    "postText": "Hi, so I am planning to apply to IS this upcoming March. I just took a bunch of pre reqs for it as well and took accounting twice. I was a bioinformatics major but was in a really bad situation where I couldn\u2019t even leave my house and ended up not doing so well and dropping my GPA. After being in a much better place, I decided I wanted to change my major, and my hopefully raise my GPA. I really became interested in IS because of the careers and what you\u2019re learning, I hope to apply but I am really stressing out about my grades and how that will impact my application. I in no way blame myself for my GPA dropping because I was barely allowed to leave to school, work or to have friends in order to form a study group. \nI originally got a B- in accounting because of the above situation, I decided to try again and got a B, (not my strongest subject the exams were HARD) which will be considered a B- when I apply. I have an A- in IS201, an A in CS142, but im really nervous when it comes to the accounting class. \nI guess i am just hoping for some support and maybe someone who got in that was in a similar situation! \nThank you\n\nNote: My advisor said I needed all As but I have a couple friends who applied to similar programs who didn\u2019t get all As. I just need more reassurance to feel like applying is worth a shot",

A big part of the application is you have an opportunity to explain why you may have done poorly in some classes and if you go to all the Pre IS events to prepare and network it will help your chances a lot. Just get to know the professors before you even apply and they can walk you through it",

After 2 years of a mission and 3 semesters after that, I applied and got in. Ya really never know. but if you believe you have potential, can show them that you have potential, and explain how your past experiences have affected your GPA, that's the best shot you can take",

Perhaps that\u2019s why your advisor said you\u2019d need all As on the prerequisites.\n\nWhen explaining any shortcomings in your essay, it\u2019s important to take responsibility rather than place blame on factors outside your control. They want to see you were able to roll with the punches and how you were able to learn, grow, and thrive.",

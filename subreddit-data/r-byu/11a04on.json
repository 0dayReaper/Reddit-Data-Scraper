Maybe the professor's schedules make it hard to schedule the meeting where they talk about admissions, maybe the department secretary is sick, maybe you are next in if someone declines and they can't let you know until the other person says yes or no. Grad school admission can be a brutal waiting game",

The general first-wave commitment deadline is April 15. \n\nSo unfortunately there's nothing to do but wait for who-knows how long.",

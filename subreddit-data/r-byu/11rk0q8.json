    "postText": "Just what the title says- forgive me if this is a silly question, but does BYU allow students to take courses over the summer break at another institution while admitted to BYU full-time? I understand that Spring/Summer semesters are a thing but I figure I could save some money and stress by taking some classes at a CC when I'm home in CA for the summer, where they'll be much cheaper and easier, and assuming they transfer. \n\nIs this a thing students often do to accelerate their degree program?",

Many times your college\u2019s academic advisors will have a list of classes that nearby university courses will sub for. You may be able to find SLCC courses that BYU has already approved and use them as a precedent for the CC you attend.",

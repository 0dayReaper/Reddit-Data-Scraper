    "postText": "I posted last week about how BYU should bench their kicker and the post got super downvoted. I still think they need a new kicker. This isn't the YMCA or a Disney movie. He had a great kicking career, but winning is more important than his feelings, you think? Why are so many BYU fans adamant about keeping Oldroyd in? It's almost like I'm talking about their cousin or something when I suggest it.",

            "comment": "To preface, I attend BYU but am not diehard fan. I watch games when I can.  I understand stats and how the game works. Let's break this down. \n\n\\&gt;This isn't the YMCA or a Disney movie. \n\nYou say this like he isn't qualified to be there. If you review his career it's solid. He was a Lou Groza Award finalist in 2020 after making all 13 of his field goal attempts that year. He was 9 of 13 last year for FG and 42/43 for XPs. All of his stats are on par with Kickers at the U over the last few years. I think this a good comp considering their (UofU) success last season. \n\n\\&gt;but winning is more important than his feelings, you think? \n\nThere is no NCAA coach who cares about his players feelings more than winning. Coaches bench players who under perform. Two misses is less than optimal but not career ending. \n\nLet's consider the alternatives. You have Peterman who has not kicked field goal or extra point in a game. There is Smith who had zero FG attempt and went 3/4 XPs in 2020 and 2/3 fg last season and 11/11 XPs for a total of 17 points that season. He has a career 20 points. For reference Oldroyd has 20 points this season. It shouldn't be super difficult to see that it would make sense to go with the kicker with the bigger sample size and proven track record of success vs two guys with no sample size and a small sample size.  \n\nCalling for guy's head over a bad game is a bit overreactive. It kind of merited the downvotes.   Now, if you can show me some empirical evidence that says otherwise I'd be opening to listening. Anyway, go Cougs!",

                    "comment": "Jake Oldroyd is more than qualified to be a kicker. In fact, he's probably more qualified than anyone else on the staff. My problem with keeping Oldroyd in is that it shows favoritism. I understand the history, but great college coaches have always had \"overreactive\" triggers. With Saban and Pete Carrol, the leash was/is always short. It sets the tone. I'm going to keep it anecdotal--this isn't so important to back up with data--but when you look at who wins in college football, it's coaches who make quick changes. But we can continue to be mediocre. I'll still cheer for us. But when you let a player underperform to the level that Oldroyd has, it makes the guys on bench feel as if their place is permanent. To keep morale up, players need to feel as if they have a shot.",

Do you keep the kid in or go back to Oldroyd? You just showed that have no confidence in Oldroyd and no acumen for selecting a starter. If I were a donor I'd start raising some questions about the coach's ability to pick personnel. \n\n\\&gt;great college coaches have always had \"overreactive\" triggers.

If a guy isn't on the field there is probably something to that. \n\n \\&gt;But we can continue to be mediocre.\n\nIf you believe that we are mediocre right now, what do you believe us being great looks like? Apparently, being mediocre is ranking in the top 20. So that mean great is ranking in the top 10?  We will never compete with the SEC, Big 10 or be a serious contender for the CFP. Full stop.",

That said, I disagree with you alluding to the point that BYU isn't mediocre. I'm more worried about the mindset than the actual win. If I am cheering for a team who hopes for nothing more than mediocrity, I am cheering for the wrong team. UCF and SDSU will likely never win championships. That doesn't prevent them from being delusional. Maybe BYU's fanbase needs to be a little more delusional.",

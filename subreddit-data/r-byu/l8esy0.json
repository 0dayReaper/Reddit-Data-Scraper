I lived in a crappy house for two years. BYU came by each year telling the landlord they needed to fix the giant crack in our ceiling or they wouldn\u2019t get approved. The landlord agrees and never fixes it. Come next year, they say the same thing. No penalty to the landlord whatsoever. The landlord never actually fixes the issues and the house is still BYU approved",

Right when I moved out of Glenwood was when they were switching each building to a single gender because the lobby of the building fell like 5 feet short of the minimum separation distance between men and women housing. So they'll enforce stuff like that, but get back mold in your apartment and suddenly \"we don't have enough manpower to investigate and enforce things like that\"",

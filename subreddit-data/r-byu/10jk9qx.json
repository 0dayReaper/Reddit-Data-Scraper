My two extracurriculars were employment at Chick-fil-a and spending 3 years as an amateur genealogist. I'm also an out of state applicant, if that makes any difference.",

I got into this school with a 3.86 GPA, 1220 sat, with robotics, cross country (running), lend a hand (I made prosthetic hands for free to people in the community), and HOSA. I also worked at Top Choice Lawn Care in Austin TX as a service representative since my freshman year.\n\nDon\u2019t know if that helps you gauge understanding of what the application process is like.\n\n(Source: my aunt who USED worked in the applications department.)",

I applied two years ago and didn't get in for Fall semester but reapplied and got in for Winter. I'm also from Asia so everyone told me that I'd get a higher chance of getting in but I don't think where you're from plays that big of a role in your acceptance. The first time I applied though my ACT was extremely low for BYU - it was a 24 I think and my gpa was a 3.7. The next time I applied my gpa went down to a 3.5 but then I retook the ACT and got a 28 and I revised or changed the entire topic of my essays. Idk if that is helpful to you but I think what they care most about is the uniqueness of your essays, so I'd put the most attention into that. I think overall though your chances of getting in are good. Good luck!",

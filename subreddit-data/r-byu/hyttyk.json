As well as a few routes that extend further out and pick up less frequently. \n3) Or easiest of all, just build a parking garage or 2.\n\nThe thing they don\u2019t seem to understand is that if they want people to rely on public transport, they have to actually provide good public transport. That is going to cost just as much as a parking garage, and likely more in the long run",

In terms of near campus I think one of the better places to build is in the lot north of the IPF, this could help serve the future use of the old Provo high. Throw up some sky bridges to cross university and that would help a lot.\n\n Another one is at 800 N and 400 E by the LSB. BYU is gonna be taking possession of the forest service building this year so they will own that entire block. Demolishing the old maxwell institute and they could build a decent sized parking garage right by south campus.\n\nAnother possible location could be at the roundabout by the SE corner of the Bean musuem, the elevation change there could help them fit a lot of levels in there. This would be opposite the stream from the MOA.\n\nThe big parking it Wymount is for heritage, that could also be built on.\n\nLastly, would be North of the Broadcast building, this could be nice to help with event capacity too.\n\nBUT none of these will be built in the remote future unfortunately, until then admin is fine with people parking at the stadium and complaining online :)",

No way I can drive to school, walk 20 mins to class and be on time, walk 20 mins back to my car in time to drive 10-30 mins to work, drive back to school, walk 20 mins to class, etc. Public transit in Utah is better than a lot of other states, but not enough for students like me to rely primarily on it.\n\nBYU made a tough choice; I can't say it was really a right choice. The right choice would be dual purpose - expand campus building footprints to meet demands sure but also either 1) build more parking, which probably means building vertically (read: expensive) or 2) massively expand on- or near-campus housing to actually make the administration's master plan match student housing/commuting reality. If the administration really wants BYU to be a walking campus, they need to enable that by massively investing in the infrastructure needed to make that dynamic equitable for students. \n\nIt's obviously not intentional, but you can't help but feel marginalized if you're a student who isn't living on-campus and who has to manage a complex living/work schedule.",

I don't think the new building is going to be large enough to completely replace the HFAC. \n\nThe talmage building is overcrowded, and the rumor i heard is that the animation department will be moved from the talmage to the HFAC after the music department moves to the new building.",

It\u2019s more cost effective to tear it down and rebuild than what it would need to be renovated (there are more problems there than most people can imagine). They can\u2019t do that until the music building is done though because they don\u2019t have enough space for practice rooms in Provo High. Fine Arts will then get a building that is suited to current needs and program developments. \n\nObviously this all might have changed after the coronavirus and its financial ramifications, but that was the plan as of around March.",

There\u2019s been rumors about how they\u2019ll replace it but nothing substantial. Fingers crossed they go for the underground garage, they\u2019ve already got the excavation for the HFAC. \n\nAs for the second point: I am so, so grateful they didn\u2019t. The old Provo High is... not a great building at all. I rehearsed there for a winter with an independent percussion group and it was a nightmare. Plus, it\u2019s way too small to realistically support the School of Music in terms of storage, practice rooms, offices, and university sized rehearsal spaces. I\u2019m hoping and praying they give us a good parking structure on that lot, preferably underground.",

We used it for sports camps.\n*Chants support for an underground garage*\n\nThis is off-topic, but I just hope BYU is smart with the old high property. Plans were in the works to raze the field &amp; track, which would be idiotic, given how new those facilities are.\nAthletics has been begging for another indoor facility, so it wouldn\u2019t be that hard to just put a bubble around that one. That\u2019d be incredible, given how awful the indoor track is right now. Volleyball often practices at the same time as the track team (and other teams practice at the same time as the club track team). People wander onto the track while people are sprinting on it.\nDiv 1 sports have also been in need of access to the IPF, so allowing Intramurals to use the old high \u201cbubble\u201d would solve that issue.",

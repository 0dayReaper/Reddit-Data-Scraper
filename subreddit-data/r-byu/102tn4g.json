    "postText": "I\u2019ve spent hours a day for the past 6 weeks trying to find housing for January-April. My only requirements are 1 male spot within walking distance to campus. It seems nowhere is willing to work with my study abroad; I can\u2019t afford to be paying rent May-August while in another country. Anyone have any tips?\n\nI\u2019m feeling defeated and just angry at this point. I\u2019m in all the Facebook groups. I\u2019ve checked with on campus. Tried to call and email all the complexes and management, and the few who answer aren\u2019t helpful. I\u2019m supposed to fly into Provo on Thursday, but as of now, what\u2019s the point if I\u2019m going to be homeless?",

            "comment": "Idk if too many complexes that would give you a 4 month contract. You could either:\n\n1) Commit to a contract until August and then sublease the spot the months you aren't there\n2) Pretty much the same as 1 but you find someone in advance and work with the complex to transfer the contract\n3) Live in a sublet yourself for the semester\n\nI'd also recommend you expand where you're looking apart from just a walk from campus. You could find exactly what you need a little further from campus. I live right next to UVU and take the free UVX bus to school every day.",

My contract was understood to only be during the school year. I got every penny of my deposit back at the end.\n\nNow I jump to just last school year. Rent was 400 for a cramped and horribly maintained apartment. Redstone management promised me a parking spot and when I called upon signing to buy the parking pass told me that all parking spots were sold out. I cleaned the apartment like crazy and really tried to maintain it; They took 300 off my deposit.",

If any of the apartments you've looked at so far do that that might be your best option. In any case paying for one month is four times better than paying for four.",

You simply have to let your rental management know x days/months in advance. If this option is offered. It's all spelled in the lease. Selling your summer part of the lease is hard to near impossible. So many people are selling their summer portions.",

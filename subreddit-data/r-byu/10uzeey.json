So they aren\u2019t as dangerous as a bear or a poisonous snake, but don\u2019t go trying to pet them like they\u2019re oversized dogs. Just stay back and watch, and if you take pictures, make sure your flash is off so you don\u2019t scare them. I always see them traveling in groups, so if you see one, see if it has friends with it nearby! I\u2019ve seen 7 at a time before!",

My head says \"back away slowly\", my heart says \"leave society and live with them in the woods,\" my tummy says \"eat them\". \n\nAlso, can deer bounce? I was taking my dog out at 3am and I swear I saw one bunny hop away, leaping three feet in the air. Maybe I was just seeing things, it was super late, but that was one bouncy deer.",

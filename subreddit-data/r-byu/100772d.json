However, if something is fulfilling a need that other people and places can\u2019t fulfill and you want to help make that impact while reasonably using your time it\u2019s still important to make a profit in some cases. Like when I went on my mission I appreciated the Modern Missionary store and how I could get all my stuff in one place at the same time. Or I appreciate all the items in the BYU store such as the prep books for missions and artwork of the temple. I think that business is supposed to bless the lives of others on both sides.",

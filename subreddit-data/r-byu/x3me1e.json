            "comment": "copying my comment from this same thead on r/lds because we need to do better than this article when talking about this stuff.\n\nTo be honest, I think this article is generally a miss for fair. A lot of opinion being stated as fact here.\n\nAnd I even agree that it wouldn't make sense for byu to distribute the pamphlet, but the things in the pamphlet are what they proport to be: resources and support for LGBT students. I think the author's tone of ghastly disgust for hormone therapy, drag races and a group called the \"black menace\" says more about the author than it does about the group trying to distribute these pamphlets, or those who participate in said activities.\n\nThere was a way to write this article in a more matter of fact tone. talk about how those who tried to distribute the pamphlet may have had good intentions, but that there were things in the pamphlet that directly go against church doctrine and policy and allowing it to be distributed could be seen as the school endorsing those groups.\n\nThat would be fine to say. Instead we're over here calling the whole lgbt movement a \"scourge\". We should be well past trying to demonize our LBGT brothers and sisters. They're not an evil group trying to corrupt your youth, they are your youth, they are your family. And they're dealing with a LOT. If we don't have empathy for them, we're turning them away from the gospel.",

People who feel out of place, especially those with LGBT concerns, need somewhere/someone to turn to, but they probably won't be helped by losing their testimony or having their values slowly eroded.\n\nI think the article does an excellent job of hilighting those toxic influences and the danger of them.",

To have a desire to steal. On rare occasions in that situation I have considered how easy it would be.\n\nOr perhaps someone is recovering from a porn addiction and recognizing that they are suceptible to temptation if they don't guard themselves. That person needs to be aware of, recognize where they are, be honest about their feelings, know God's commandments and decide what they will choose to do.\n\nIt's another thing to say that because a person can't act on and fulfill their particular temptation, that there is a contradiction in the doctrine of the church. The doctrine is that (even though it is really hard sometimes!) Only a man and a woman can be sealed together for eternity, and that is what God designed.",

It's a natural drive to procreate, which can be very fulfilling, and God wants us to have it in the right way and time.\n\nIt seems we are coming from different moral systems. I see attraction to men/women as something we are born with in varying degrees and consciously and unconsciously change throughout our lives. If all aim for a heterosexual relationship, some are at advantages and disadvantages. It may be that some people do choose to not engage in a romantic relationship to follow God's commandments.\n\nYour same argument could be made for polyamory. Many, many people believe they won't be happy with just one person, but that is also at odds with God's direction for us.",

There is a way forward along His path that will lead to more lasting joy than any other.\n\nIf you, or someone else, has tried and is struggling and the commandments of God only seem like restrictions that are unfair and restricting, I invite them to try again.

Every incoming BYU student was nearly invited (or, if the reporting is correct, some were in fact invited before the administration intervened) to a drag show? A ghastly caricature of womanhood, a reduction of the sacred to a profane mockery, a sexualized depersonalization of half of Heavenly Father\u2019s children\u2013some BYU students were hosting this and thought it proper to invite the entire student body?\n\n\nDisgusting, hateful and ignorant. That\u2019s the LDS in a nutshell.",

Brigham Young had a cross dressing son that performed in drag.  That young man even performed for the prophet Lorenzo Snow's birthday in drag.  His stage name was Madame Pattirini\n\nAnd I think the rest of the article can be sumarized as **BYU should rather see transgender students dead than give them access to affirming resources**\n\nAll the potential side effects listed are explained by medical professionals, but many of those treatments help transgender students.  \n\nTheir jab at USGA is also very ironic.  That group has been trying to get official university status for years... but BYU refuses to even let them meet on campus.  \n\nAlso the fact they wouldn't reference to planned parenthood is sad, they provide many important health screenings for LGBT people.  But again, I guess BYU would rather students get a life changing STD than give them a resource that could prevent that.  \n\nEven faithful Mormon couples can use planned parenthood for family planning.  (Using birth control to have kids when they want to have kids, not just when daddy's condom breaks)\n\nIt is sad that this article claims to be concerned with LGBT peoples physical and mental wellbeing... when in reality it is 100% about pushing dogma over LGBT persons wellbeing.",

It's saying that those organizations are fine to include. \n\nInteresting point about B. Morris Young. Yes, he did dress in drag. And did perform for President Snow. The difference is, those drag shows were incredibly different than today's. He dressed up to look like a real woman. He sang in a falsetto voice intended to sound like a real woman. In fact, I'm pretty sure President Snow didn't know he was a man.\n\nThis is a far cry from the satanic imitation of womanhood we're seeing today.\n\nYour summary of the rest of the article is intended to inflame extremists than actually engage in debate. BYU clearly wishes no harm on any person. The point of removing these flyers is to limit exposure to harmful organizations that are creating trans people (see Abigail Shrier's excellent work on this) and then convincing them to mutilate their bodies with drugs and surgeries all to enrich doctors and activists.\n\nThere are few reasons a faithful Latter-day Saint single adult would need Planned Parenthood.

When you are isolated in an ultra religious not understanding environment suicidal thoughts happen.  I know because I was there... and dozens of people in my shoes felt the same.  (Thank God I wasn't at BYU, lol)  \n\nBYU wants to cut LGBT people off from affirming resources that might offer an alternative to suicide.  It might not be their explicit intention but it is the end result.  \n\nAnd again, sure, planned parenthood shouldn't need to be used for single Mormons, but if they make a mistake, or want to do things as an adult, they should have resources.   \n\nI don't know why BYU insists on infantilizing their students, even to their detriment.   \n\nThere is no reason why they should prefer a student experiement and get and STD, rather than experiment, not get and STD, and either way, still feel the consequences.",

    "postText": "I am aware this kind of question is asked a lot so im sorry but help is appreciated. I rarely see many students from my area of the world go to BYU provo. I think this is because BYU-H is the main avenue for people from New Zealand. However my dream uni would be BYU provo.\n\nSome interesting facts about me:\n\n\\- WHERE IM FROM/ ETHNICITIES: Would be considered international. Parents are Samoan/Australian. I have however lived in New Zealand most my life. I am bilingual (Samoan and English)\n\nDo international students who grew up in a more or less developed country such as New Zealand still considered evenly in comparison to international students from say less developed countries? Does being bilingual and having a diverse ethnic background matter?\n\nDo students from countries in the pacific such as New Zealand have less chance since BYU will likely expect us to use BYU-H as our 'go-to' university or will they still consider pacific country students to go to BYU if they meet their requirements?\n\n\\- EDUCATION SO FAR: Currently in my last 2 months of HS doing the IB (international baccalaureate) programme. I am predicting myself to get a 36-40 points for the final exams out of 45. My subjects include HL psych, chemistry and biology. SL's being Spanish, Math AI and English langlit.\n\nWill this be too low to get into BYU provo? What are some other academic tests I could do to improve my chances of being accepted?\n\n\\- SPIRITUAL LIFE: I am a member. Have been since birth. I have attended seminary on and off throughout the last 4 years. I have really weak attendance (30-40%) and will not pass unfortunately. My gospel knowledge is not bad however as I have always attended Sunday church. I am planning on going to institute aswell after I finish HS. I am going to still attend as much as possible for the rest of this year.\n\nHow much will not being a seminary graduate impact my chances of being accepted?\n\nEXTRACURRICULARS: Was in debating team. Do other stuff for the IB course (CAS)\n\ntd;dr: Just a few questions if anyone is willing to help.\n\nDoes BYU expect students from pacific countries (in my case New Zealand) to apply for BYU-H or is there still a chance for us to make it to the BYU's in mainland America?\n\nIs achieving a 36-40 points in IB satisfactory to meet BYU's academic requirements? Does IB look at CAS things?\n\nIs not passing seminary a huge disappointment in my chances of being accept to BYU?\n\nGeneral advice on getting in, in regards to essays, extracurriculars, service e.t.c?",

            "comment": "I got in 2016 without graduating from seminary. Back then all they cared about was GPA and your ACT/SAT score, and I was international as well.\n\nThe only thing to keep in mind is that you just have to have a good GPA and a good ACT/SAT score, the rest of the extracurricular stuff is nice but for an international, they probably don't weigh it that much.\n\nI don't think BYU has an expectation for you to go to a specific BYU campus based on your country of origin. I am from South America and went to BYU Provo.\n\nIn terms of essays, just proofread them with someone else and then get feedback. I pretty much used the same stuff from my BYU-ELC application lol.\n\nI can't help you with the IB thing because my HS didn't offer it. I also didn't take any AP classes.\n\nI only applied with a 3.97 GPA and a 1300/1600 (Math and Critical Reading) SAT score. In terms of extracurriculars, nothing special I think I just wrote that I played basketball lol. BYU is now more holistic in its approach when accepting students now as far as I know because I have heard people with lower stats than mine getting in recent years.\n\nIf you end up getting rejected and you are set to go to BYU Provo, you can go to Ensign college up in salt lake, and then transfer to BYU.",

            "comment": "I got in BYU as an international student (Taiwan) without taking any AP/IB courses. I'd say SAT and GPA are the most important thing they look for. Seminary is also very important; you also have to have to go to seminary or have a good excuse for not attending. I had an excuse for not attending (90 minutes to and from + HS starts at 7:30 for us) and I got in but my brother left his seminary section blank and didn't get in. Our applications are basically identical except for that.\n\nMy stats from 2019? GPA: 3.60, SAT: 1550, no seminary. \nExtracurricular: volunteering to teach disadvantaged kids + Model United Nations.\n\nJust a tip, don't be too disappointed if you don't get in, just apply to BYUI then transfer. It's cheaper, you get to earn ez credits that are hard to earn at Provo and you'll have a lot of spare time for dating/working on your self/self-development. I was legit super jealous of my brother when he transferred to Provo with a six-pack and a bunch of past dating experience, dude lost 20 kg and has more confidence than I've ever seen him. If I can do it again, I'll def go to BYUI first.",

            "comment": "i'm half polynesian half american but grew up in asia and graduated from an IB school. I didn't do the IB diploma but took 5 IB classes and one AP my final year. honestly BYU really does like diversity and from what I've seen they've made a massive push for getting more polynesian/asian/etc students. \n\nI didn't take any of my IB exams but I submitted my final semester grades which were 6s and 7s. I also rarely attended seminary my last year but I worked things out with my teacher and explained in the application my reasoning why (sickness and travel for me). but in my application i reaaallly pushed the fact that I wasn't just a white kid born and raised in utah (no offense lmao) because that's what unis look for- what makes you stand out. talk about your culture and experiences and that'll definitely get them. I have so many friends who barely graduated HS but because they talked about their culture and spirituality they got in. I definitely think you'll be good!!\n\nALSO major tip- reach out to an MSS advisor. If you get in with those guys, it's almost guaranteed you're in tbh. I'd also suggest taking the ACT/SAT at least once to see how you score. I scored better on the ACT because I'm better at more/simple questions as opposed to less/complicated ones. lmk if you need help with the MSS things because it makes a huge difference- trust me!!! good luck cuz",

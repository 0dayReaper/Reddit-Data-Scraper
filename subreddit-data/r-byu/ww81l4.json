You get to ask students about their experience and find out about beginning of year activities.\n\n1 day is fine, you can learn a lot of the stuff just walking around campus yourself, which I recommend. There are a lot of neat places and niche resources that have helped me a ton over the years.\n\nI say go, get free stuff and map out your classes after.",

We\u2019re gonna give you good info on things like locations, how changing your major works, how college life works, and you\u2019ll get a lot of shirts, byu merch, planners, and it\u2019s just gonna make your life much easier.",

Getting to know other students entering BYU at the same time as you, meeting the BYUSA clubs and clubs in your major at the mini-club rush. Finally you only pass this way once so if you don\u2019t have something better to do then it doesn\u2019t hurt. \n\nAnd there is free lunch which seems to be the #1 reason folks show up to BYU events",

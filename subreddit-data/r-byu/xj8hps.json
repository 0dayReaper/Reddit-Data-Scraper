    "postText": "The Authorities say that Byui is Cheap and Effective. The norm is two semester fall and spring 16 week standard and students can easily transfer from school to school. Rexburg idaho wants to change that, they have a completely random scheduled mid season of 3 terms of 14 weeks. And they want all the area high schools to change to 3 terms also. What if every private university decided to pick random schedules some started in October, April ,july so your your credits only transfer within thier own systems. Byui has the most federal aid students in the state and maybe the country each student is required to use all thier electives for religion credits only all paid for by federal aid. Why does this system get accreditation?  Sure do your own thing but why does the government fund a system that's not compatible with the public system and all the wasted goverment money in a private system that is sub standard and students loose all credits if of thier own free will try to exit from. The random on off schedule wears students out only 17% graduate with in a reasonable time period the elongated timed school system wears out the students physical emotional and financial resources. And wastes government aid",

Studying music is hard and it requires a lot emotionally and mentally from students. I feel like I haven\u2019t had any down time since the beginning of the semester. Weekends are hectic with football games (I\u2019m in the marching band), homework, and practicing. I\u2019m worried my private teacher will become frustrated or disappointed in me if I\u2019m not giving it my best all the time. \n\nWhat do you all think?",

Depending on your studio professor you could always be really upfront with them. That helped me in one case. I ended up venting to my professor about a lot of things and he helped me not only at school but also in my personal life \ud83d\ude02 \nMusic major life is rough. But it does calm down if you can hold on. Postpone generals, focus on the music stuff and also map out your classes so you can have a light at the tunnel. Depending if you\u2019re performance or what major, each semester will have a different focus. Also consider taking generals during the summer to balance things out!",

If things (i.e. graduation) end up taking a little longer, it won't make much difference in the long run.\n\nYou only get to be young once. This could (and should) be one of the most carefree periods of your life. Spend it figuring yourself out, preparing for the future that is surely out there, and enjoying every bit of it. \n\nGood luck OP. You've got this.",

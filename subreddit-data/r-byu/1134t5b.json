    "postText": " Hello, everyone!\n\nI am a student at East High School in Salt Lake City looking for participants for my anonymous survey about television's influence on viewers and their behaviors. I would be very grateful if you could spare a few minutes to complete this survey.\n\nThe only requirements are that you are at least eighteen years old and a Utah resident.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the survey, you may contact me at [caroline.w599@slcstudents.org](mailto:caroline.w599@slcstudents.org).\n\nOtherwise, you can click [here](https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1ZC5mkuiAOz5KE6?Q_CHL=social&amp;Q_SocialSource=reddit) to begin!\n\nThank You!\n\nCaroline Wilcox",

            "comment": "Professor Gregory Wilkinson - Eastern Religions or World Religions. Easy class and I think the topics are very interesting. The world religions class is mostly reading and reading quizzes. There's also several \"enrichment activities\" that you do throughout the semester such as watching movies or going to mass. You choose the enrichment activities. He also drops several of your lowest grades for reading quizzes and in class discussion. There's also no tests. Eastern religion it's a similar deal except you do daily meditation and less enrichment activities. \n\nAlso Professor Mike MacKay. There are no dropped assignments in his classes, but his lectures are excellent. If you are concerned about your grade and you talk to him, he will assign you make up work. He contributes research to the Joseph Smith Papers. He is super knowledgeable about the restoration and he has helped me increase my faith like no other professor. If you do assignments in completion and on time, you'll get 100% on everything. No tests.\n\nTLDR: Professor Wilkinson and Professor MacKay both offer very fulfilling classes and you'll get an A very easily if you do the assignments. No tests.",

Of my 4 co-workers, one got sick and the others all tested negative because I let them know the moment I felt sick. Here is the issue, no one can be held responsible for spreading an illness they dont know they have. It can take days to show symptoms, so that is why it is important to social distance continuously in case you have been exposed. I did take this very seriously. The only people we allowed ourselves contact with were my aunt and uncle. Both were working from home at the time, and didn't go anywhere. The problem arose when my uncle's work required that he return to the office. At that point, no amount of caution can really ensure something wont happen. I ask you, in all seriousness, what would you have done better?",

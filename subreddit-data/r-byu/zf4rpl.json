    "postText": "I\u2019m working on the alumni scholarship for BYU as a (hopeful) incoming freshman. The two questions for that particular scholarship have a max character limit of 3000, but I\u2019ve only got ~1000 for each\u2026 is this okay or should I shoot for more? Idk if whoever looks at the scholarships are looking for a min char count or just want you to answer the question..\n\nFor reference, the questions are basic stuff like \u201cwhat will you do to honor the fund?\u201d and \u201cwhy do you need this scholarship?\u201d (Idk how I can fill 3000 characters of why I need money haha)",

I just want to finish school and get my degree\u201d \n\nIt was literally about that long \n\nAnd I got a half tuition scholarship, with a terrible GPA. \n\nSo as long as it gets whatever message you\u2019re trying to tell across effectively I think it\u2019ll be fine.",

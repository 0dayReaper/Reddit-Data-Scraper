Just going through the motions\u201d it was a bad path for me. But that\u2019s just me\u2014 I have to make a list. And just do the list that day.

So don't just hit the ground running and only focus on school work to the exclusion of all else find a balance that you get to do good things in the midst of hard things. This will homogenize the experience so it's not as an abrupt change in the future. As you enter the workforce or the next stage of your life you won't have the luxury of downtime like a holiday break save for occasional vacations so figuring out that that work/life balance will be key to preventing burn out. You can do it but it will take a little time to get the ball rolling. Keep it up you can do it!",

I picture me being responsible and doing well by the end of the semester and how that would feel.\n\n2) I plan fun things for the break so I have something to look forward to.\n\n3) It's a missionary tool, but I still abide by a lot of its principles: *Adjusting to Missionary Life*. Two of my favorite pieces of advice in there are:  \n\\-\"Break your work into small pieces, and take on only one task at a time. At each step, remind yourself, 'All I have to do right now is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.' For example, 'All I have to do right now is call the ward mission leader\u201d or \u201cAll I have to do right now is get dressed for the day.'\"  \n\\-\"Pray for the desire to \\[do the thing\\] if you have trouble getting motivated. Then start by telling yourself you only have to do five minutes. Motivation usually follows action. In other words, we become more motivated once we get started.\"  \nThe *Adjusting to Missionary Life* handbook has really helped me both during and after my mission. Almost all of the principles apply even if you're not a missionary: [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/resource-booklet-adjusting-to-missionary-life/suggestions-and-tools/general-principles-for-managing-stress?lang=eng](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/resource-booklet-adjusting-to-missionary-life/suggestions-and-tools/general-principles-for-managing-stress?lang=eng)  \nFrankly, I think it should be required reading for everyone.",

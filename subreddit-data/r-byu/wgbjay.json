            "comment": "I took his class during Winter 2022 semester. Let me give you an unbiased review and then my biased review:\n\nUnbiased:\n- About the professor:\n   *Very smart guy\n   * Monotone voice\n   *Tends to get behind on lectures and then he tries to catch up right before the exam. \n-About the class:\n   * It is strictly a history class. I would say only 10% of the lectures and topics are sunday school gospel style. Compared to foundations of the restoration, here you will dive in into historical details about the restoration and the life of Joseph Smith.  So, if you like history, you might like this.\n   *This is a class where memorization means good grades. Here you won't have analysis assignments or open questions in the exams. The exams are 100% memorization multiple choice of names, places, events, and years. It goes to the point of having to memorize all the names of the first quorum of the twelve in order of seniority amd how that order changed over time. \n   *The professor gives you a very comprehensive and and complete study guide since day one. Half of the questions in the study guide are from the readings and half from what it is discussed in class. The idea is that you fill it up while you read and while you are in class. If you miss classes, you will have a hard time in the exams. \n   * The readings could be long. It is your standard 20-30 pages of a history textbook, but written by the church. \n\nMy biased opinion:\n\n   *I really liked the professor. He truly cared for the student and made accomodations based on the circumstances. \n  * I hated this class but because I hate history as a subject in school. I just find history extremely boring and pointless they way it is taught (just memorization and zero analysis of it). I felt this class just forced me to memorize a ton of crap I didn't care or that it was irrelevant for my personal growth or testimony. However, I knew people who loved this class because they do well with memorization. \n\nIn sum:\n   *If you like or are good at history classes, you'll do well. If you hate history, you will have a somewhat negative experience in this class.",

            "comment": "So, I took 342 (Pioneers and Persecution) instead of 341, but from what I've heard, they're taught pretty much the exact same way.\n\nI absolutely loved this course! And I hate history and tend to do very poorly in classes that require a ton of memorization. But Brother Hedges presents the information like a story that you want to learn more about. Yes, his voice is a little monotone, so that may have impacted how well people could pay attention. But a big part of his teaching style is writing on the whiteboard. In fact, when I took his class (Fall 2021) he only tested us on what was on the whiteboard, and we had really easy pop quizzes based on the reading (100% every time if you do the reading, basically). Things might have changed in the last year, but it seemed like this is how he had been running his class for a while.\n\nI just know that this class will go down as one of my favorite religion courses at BYU. Brother Hedges truly cared for all of his students and their understanding of difficult Church history topics. He answered every single question that was asked about Church history, yet he was extremely humble and quick to tell people when he wasn't 100% certain or thought there might be a better resource.\n\nOverall, I walked out of that class feeling like I could have a conversation about Church history, which is something I was never confident in before.\n\nIf you want to learn about Church history at a deeper level than you have before, I highly recommend this course. But if you want your religion electives to mostly focus on the spiritual or scriptural side of the Church, then you probably won't find this class very interesting. Brother Hedges is a great teacher, but I think it depends more on how much you want to learn about the material.",

            "comment": "Physical Science 100 was one of the easiest classes I took at BYU. The nice thing about it was you could also take the Challenge Exam for the class - you enroll in the class and take the exam in the testing center the first week of class - and if you get above a 70% then you don't even have to take the class and you will get a pass on your transcript. The exam is not a part of your grade and is completely optional for if you want to skip the class. I got a 65 and ended up having to take the class, but I also only studied for the exam for like 3 hours before. There is a full physical science 100 course study guide online that you can find pretty easily. Just for context, I am an Econ major with a Math minor if that helps. Definitely not a science person either - confused to no end by the basic laws of motion and I think I got like a 30 on that portion of the ACT.",

Also the TAs for physical science are often not physics or chem majors per-say thus they understand when you don\u2019t understand more often than we native stem majors do",

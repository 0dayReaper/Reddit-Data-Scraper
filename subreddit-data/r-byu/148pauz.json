            "comment": "This is strictly my opinion, but here\u2019s how I\u2019d break it down: \nIf you\u2019re getting a 3.2 or above, you\u2019re doing great. Between 3-3.2 is fine, anything below that and you may be struggling a little bit more than the average student. Obviously anything above a 3.5 is something to be proud of, and a 3.9 or above is extremely great academic performance. \n\nGPAs are a little like ACT scores though. They may impact scholarships, awards, etc., and ease of getting accepted into a masters program or a professional post-bachelors school, but in the grand scheme of things they just aren\u2019t the most important part of your college experience, and I know plenty of successful doctors and grad school students who didn\u2019t get the perfect GPA in undergrad. \n\nNetwork! Get to know your professors. Make friends in your program and in your extracurricular activities. Don\u2019t sell your soul to a 4.0 GPA and miss out on everything else. College is so much more than that\u2014especially BYU.",

What is considered \u201cgood\u201d grade wise may depend on what you want to do after college. Straight to work - connection, internships etc are more important and grades are more of a benchmark (too low raises questions but don\u2019t need to always be super high). If you\u2019re pre law or pre med you need to see what the GPA expectation are for specific schools. For post grad programs you would need to see what the GPA numbers are for specific fields.

Also, some entry level classes are a filter if you are planning to apply for a specific program (e.g. business majors, animation, etc) and they tend to be more difficult in comparison with other generals. \n\nMake sure to not loose sleep over grades too much. Learn to have a good balance between taking care you your mental health and doing well enough in your classes. Sometimes the jump to B+ to A- is not worth the toll on your mental health.",

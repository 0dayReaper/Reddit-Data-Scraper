Cranberry juice is cheap and comes in large volumes so I\u2019d recommend that. Plus vodka crans smack. Gotta have some beers too to keep people hydrated in between mixed drinks. Personally, I like PBR and Coors but honestly anything cheap will do. As far as bud goes, I\u2019d suggest going with sativa over indica. Set a small room aside as the smoking room and get a hot box going. That way the smell stays localized and the efficiency of the weed is maximized. I recommend prerolls or blunts. They are easy to pass around and they won\u2019t get you so stoned you that can\u2019t have a good time. Plus bongs break easily at parties and you\u2019ll lose your bowls.\n\nPro tip: lock any room you don\u2019t want anyone peeing or fucking in. Have fun!",

I took Calc 1 in highschool but really appreciated retaking it in college. The mission definitely took a toll on my memory, but the college lectures definitely went more in depth than my highschool teachers ever did. This really helped going forward into more advanced math courses.\n\nAlso, not sure what major you're entering, but with the mechanical engineering program, admittance is dependent on the grades of your first math course you take as well as a few other courses. So taking Calc 1 again meant for a pretty easy A giving me an edge over the freshman who took Calc 2 as their first math class and who maybe ended with a B.",

Power, Chain, product, and quotient rules, as well as limits and some trigonometric and log rules. Calc 2 is a HUGE time commitment regardless of your skill level. Go to every recitation and get help if you take more than 1 or 2 hours on a problem. You'll be just fine.",

Obviously BYU has hard math classes, but Calc 2 is a pretty hard 100-level class. \n\nWhatever you do, I recommend taking this class seriously and understanding the time commitment required.",

If math classes were easy for you in high school (if you took Ap Calc AB, which I assume since you're not starting in 112), then take a week or so at the beginning to re-memorize all your basic 6  trig derivatives and integrals really well. The first two weeks will be a bit of a rush but I found the class not too bad, got a 94 I think just jumping straight in",

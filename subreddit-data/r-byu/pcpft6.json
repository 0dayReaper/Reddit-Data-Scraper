They are a rough representation and are not exact down to a couple feet but give a good idea of who owns what. \n\nYeah anything south of 800 N should be fine, we mostly focused on the areas by the stairs on the corner, by the duck pond stairs, and LSB for cleanup. People usually put stuff there cus the foot traffic. It was kind of a shame to clean up some of the real good art but a job is a job.",

More competitive than any job I have ever applied for.\n\nAnd I am no super-star but any potential blemish stood out. I was a college athlete, I was educated, dedicated to The Church, charismatic, charming, and happily married to a beautiful and equally dedicate wife. \n\nAnd when I visited the shot caller I thought it might have been close and I could try again in another year. I wasn\u2019t in the top 10 (out of like 50 potential choices). Several of the applicants were professionals who were willing to leave their successful careers to be Seminary teachers including a couple lawyers and others with successful well-paid careers.\n\nI get the joke, but this kid might be stacking lumber at a home improvement store or shelves at a sporting goods store before he has a job with any sort of competitive nature, and CES jobs are the most competitive I\u2019ve seen and I am middle aged and have moved several times around the country for work.\n\nAs an aside, after all the stress I went through many years ago, my wife was called as a Seminary teacher six years ago.

Palmer wrote at least one antagonistic work even publishing an anti book under a pseudonym while a CES employee and was moved to a job teaching at the Prison to protect his job and employment. The Church has a record of protecting jobs.\n\nBut hire him in the first place?\n\nI don\u2019t see it happening.\n\nThe Church and many other employers have protected bad or troubled employees. Probably to keep them from saying \u201cbut I have a wife, kids and a mortgage, MaRMaNs are haters!!\u201d\n\nBut this kid isn\u2019t a CES employee.\n\nHe isn\u2019t anything. And his prospects for employment anywhere just got even more limited.\n\nI won\u2019t let my kids say \u201cthat\u2019s gay\u201d in jest. And the f word for gay people\u2026 that\u2019s unacceptable anywhere.\n\n\u201cHe will find a safe job in CES\u201d is an unnecessary cheap shot at The Church. My wife taught seminary for five years. Through the years, her class had several lovely and wonderful gay kids. And a transgender child. Her mandate from The Church was to bring souls -all souls\u2014 to Christ.\n\nAnd these kids, all the kids\u2026 were pretty awesome.",

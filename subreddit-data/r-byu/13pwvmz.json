After some research, i narrowed down to Sfl 223 (the teacher not that great on rate my prof), hlth 335, phil 110 or soc 111. If anyone has insights on those classes or have other recommendations, i would appreciate it. Im just looking to pass with minimal work.",

The class technically has lectures from 4-7 pm on Wednesdays, but they just review the content covered online. It\u2019s a gamified class so the structure is a lil wonky but I really enjoyed it. The content is easily digestible as well. It\u2019s probably the easiest psychology class I\u2019ve taken. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to have to think about the class you take and have time for it, I would also recommend taking bronze level (100 level) dance classes. You can take DANCE 180, 184, or 185 (or multiple) without needing to dedicate too much time to practice outside of classes.",

Any recommendations of places I should check out that don\u2019t exceed 650$ a month total? I\u2019ve looked everywhere from carriage cove to alpine village, any advice or help to find a spot at a townhome or somewhere nice would be greatly appreciated!",

I'm at like $620 per month, including utilities and parking, although I think they're raising the rates for this coming school year. I'm not sure when you're looking to move, but I'm pretty sure they have availability for this coming Fall, and I think they mentioned that they have some contracts for sale right now if you call the office. I haven't lived anywhere else in Provo yet, but it sounds like this place is pretty much par for the course as far as management goes. If that doesn't work for you, check out the various BYU housing groups on Facebook, they always have listings. I think there's even a group for specifically male housing.",

The controversial stories during my time were about teaching feminism on campus and how faculty got disciplined for that. But for all that it was worth, the Church did not change or give in to any of its policies. And there is no reason to. This is not UC Berkeley where intense debates occur. :) \n\nThe university is located in Provo Utah which is one of the rare places in US which is homogenous racially, culturally, politically and from religious affiliation. And that intensity of the homogeneity has the momentum to not change to media reporting. \n\nIn this particular case, racism is against not an question of \"two-side\". It is an undisputed fact and well documented on how it impacts Black Americans more than any other minority group. What two-sides could exist on that issue is fascinating to me.",

The biggest one is whether or not it even exists at BYU, and if it does should it be addressed/changed or just ignored (I\u2019ve had people on this sub tell me that it\u2019s not BYU\u2019s problem to fix). If it should be addressed/changed how? Is the office of belonging going to do anything? If we have a staunchly pro BYU newspaper they\u2019ll report that BYU fixed the issue and then not continue to share further consequences. \n\nReligiously, people may say that BYU is only accountable to God. I personally think that BYU is accountable to the students who pay tuition, those who choose to donate to the university, and the church that sponsors it. In the first two cases accurate reporting by media sources to students, faculty, alumni and donors is an important part of that accountability. Alternatively if the Lord decided to fund the school 100% then I suppose no one else would be included in the conversation. However I\u2019m sure that\u2019s an issue that is very controversial, so I understand if you strongly disagree with me. My personal opinion dictates 0% in BYU\u2019s future and decision making.",

Case in point as to how racism become a political issue you have take sides on based on your political affiliation which is so unfortunate. There are always deflection from the topic and commentary about anti-white racism, which I have yet to understand as to what that is and how it impacts society in Provo or in the state of Utah. \nEven when I was studying at the Y, people were very defensive when it came to talking about race ever so slightly. \"See I have an Asian friend, I am not racist\" was very common. It was very awkward reaction and people would always be intrigued at how a non-white non-asian (model minority:/) person was at BYU and whether they were there due to affirmative action even though university doesn't enforce affirmative action. And it was also deflection to the topic that they worked hard and are from poor family so the non-white person should not have had special privileges to be on campus (again they didn't). Its a long path to resolving that issue and hopefully it starts with acknowledgment of the history of it in our country.",

If they continued to let each college fundraise independently we would see the CS, business, and law schools/departments swell in donations where the arts would falter. \nI did try to find a source for this online but couldn\u2019t find anything, so I guess I don\u2019t really have anything to back this up.

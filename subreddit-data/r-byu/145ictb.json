    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman looking at either a biochem or neuroscience major in hopes of pursuing a medical degree in the future and was just wanting some information on the cell 120 class. Not really sure how science of biology compares to your standard biology class. If anyone has taken or has any advice regarding the intensity or enjoyment of cell 120 as a class pls let me know!",

            "comment": "Hey!! I'm also a pre Med student, but I'm focusing on exercise science. It\u2019s way more detailed and intense compared to your average bio class. I personally found it pretty tough since science is something I tend to struggle with at times. My advice is to take it when your other courses aren't overwhelming. I made the mistake of taking it with American heritage and Chem 105. For professor options, Barrow and his TAs are super nice and always ready to assist, even though his tests can be brutal. Oh, and I've heard great things about Professor Jenkins too. Let me know if you need any more info! Good luck!",

    "postText": "So for context, I\u2019m a sophomore in the college of life sciences. Last year I applied for scholarships with a 3.84 GPA and got half scholarships for fall, winter, spring, and summer. This year, I was able to boost my GPA up to a 3.91, and I got a half scholarship for fall/winter, but not spring and summer. Does anyone know why I would get a worse scholarship with better stats? I was hoping for/expecting full tuition or at least the same as what I got last year, so I\u2019m just confused.",

I know a lot of people often don\u2019t even apply for spring/summer, so maybe they had a large influx in applicants or they just have less money to give out. It may change for you though, some people who get scholarships for Spring/Summer end up not going and those get redistributed down the list",

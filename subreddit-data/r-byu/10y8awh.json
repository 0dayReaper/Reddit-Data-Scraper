    "postText": "How worth it is the Jerusalem center? I\u2019m about to graduate, I only have 16 more credit hours, but I\u2019m not in a huge rush to be done with college, I\u2019m only 20 and I just got my major done quickly because I took 16-18 credit hours every semester since fall 2020. I\u2019ve looked into the Jerusalem center and it sounds amazing, I\u2019m just hesitant with the price tag of $14,000. I don\u2019t have any student loan debt so I could get a little to go but is it worth it? I don\u2019t really have any big post grad plans so I\u2019m try to slightly delay by potentially studying abroad. \n\nAll input is welcomed and appreciated! Thanks I\u2019m advance!",

            "comment": "I don't know anyone who regretted going.\n\nHowever, I will say there are a number of other study abroad programs that will be just as rich and fulfilling at a fraction of the price and time.\n\nMine ended up being like $4500 total (including flights and expenses for the entire trip) for a 6-7 week spring term study abroad and it was just perfect. I even got a small department scholarship to reduce the cost. By the end I was ready to return home, but I look back on it with great fondness.\n\nThat being said, the Jerusalem center is a unique experience, so you do you. \n\nIf you do look into other programs, ask if the department offers scholarships for them. Many do, especially engineering related ones, or others that they're struggling to get enough people for.",

    "postText": "I was trying to look online for an answer but couldn't see any consensus between different BYU departments websites. My question is what is a passing grade for a class, and what counts as a failing grade? Some websites said a D is a fail, others that a C- was a fail. Are there even standards between all classes, or is it a class by class situation? For this particular case though I was wondering what's the lowest grade that will get me credit for taking Math 112. Thanks!",

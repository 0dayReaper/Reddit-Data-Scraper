    "postText": "Hey, friends!\n\nSo I currently have a lease (not yet signed) for a private room in a townhome south of campus but I have not been able to tour the unit yet and I'm on a time crunch to sign. Based on the pictures, reviews, and a general walk-by of the area, it looks fine but I want to get some insider knowledge if BYU Reddit users have any. \n\nTo all who have lived or been in some of the townhomes around campus, what have been your thoughts or experiences? I know they won't all be the same but any feedback would be appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

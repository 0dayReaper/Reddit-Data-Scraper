Dude if you wanna sell you gotta incentivize and provide details, and honestly this subreddit is probably not the place to do it.\n\nI would highly recommend posting on the FB marketplace and student housing pages instead, and realize you won't get face value for it. You have to incentivize a contract buyer by lowering the price, offering cash incentives, etc.\n\nI was able to sell mine a few years ago by paying someone like $400 or something to take it from May-August, but I advertised the crap out of it.\n\nEdit: imagine downvoting advice trying to help lol, good luck",

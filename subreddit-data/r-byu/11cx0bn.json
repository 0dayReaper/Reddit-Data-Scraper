There are limited classes you can take, basically GE classes. \n\nI actually did this back in 2001, I think it was called something else then. I took some evening, SLC, and summer courses to get my GPA up and then was able to get admitted as a transfer student.",

I applied to byu Provo before then and got rejected, so I did the flex program for a year (taking basically all my classes at the salt lake center) then reapplied and got in. \nLike other comments have mentioned, you are limited to taking SLC center classes and evening classes during the fall/winter semesters, but yeah, it\u2019s byu classes with byu professors and you\u2019re among byu students. You also pay byu tuition and get byu credits. So you\u2019re basically a student but still considered not admitted, and can\u2019t get a degree until you are admitted.",

Would like to avoid the commute to slc everyday, but want to take a full 12 plus hour load. Seems all evening classes start at 4 or 5:30 which would mean I could only take two 3-hour classes a week on campus. That would only be 6 credit hours.",

If you have access to mymap you can check and see what kind of classes are available and just looking at general classes will give you a good idea of if you\u2019ll be able to fill a schedule with just night classes.",

Basically, you can take evening or Salt Lake Center classes in Fall and Winter terms, and any class in Spring/Summer terms. The credits you take won't count towards a degree unless you are later admitted/transfer. You need to apply to the flex ge program and get an Ecclesiastical Endorsement like a normal student. You pay tuition as well.",

How do they expect compliance if they feel their college experience is being taken away from them?\nIs there a better way to communicate the threat that COVID imposes on the older staff even if they think that as young adults they might not have fatal effects?",

Do you really believe that people are right to put others health at risk because their college experience isn't enough fun? \"For no valid reason\" the US is about the break 200k deaths. I would consider that a pretty good reason. I live with some very old people right now and if I bring home covid they will straight up die. It's about being good citizens, I'm so sorry it's not the experience people were hoping for but tough shit it's a global pandemic.",

It's affecting literally everyone, the other 7.8 billion people on the planet aren't experiencing normal life while the poor BYU students are being targeted. We expect compliance from everybody. Actually, scratch that, I've completely lost my faith in humans due to this pandemic. I don't expect students to act like decent humans and do what is expected of everybody else in our country. But \"my experience is being ruined\" is not unique to them, and it is not a valid excuse.",

    "postText": "I am currently considering renting an apartment at the Monticello Apartment Complex and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this apartment complex? I have checked their website but unfortunately, they don't have any photos of the apartments interior. \n\nIf any of you have lived or currently live in Monticello, could you please share your experiences with the apartment complex? Specifically, I am interested in hearing about the management, maintenance, ward, and overall living experience.\n\nAdditionally, if any current residents could share photos of their apartment or the complex, that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks for the help!",

It's a unique setting with a pretty tight knit ward since the men's and women's apts are so close. Generally a social ward with things happening frequently. Not too ritzy like a nicer complex, but I think that makes the people a bit more down to earth personally. \n\nIn general, the apartments were fine (you get what you pay for) and management was ok. I know lots of people had beef with them, but I didn't find it bad. Ward is solid, you're close to campus, and you likely have church at the Manavo Chapel, not on campus, which I found a big bonus. Also met my wife there, so that was a pro.",

            "comment": "Current Monticello resident here. I live in a house so I don't know how the apartments are but the house is old, but the rent right now is cheap so I don't mind it. Management is sketchy and almost got sued by some students recently. They got taken over by Redstone last Fall and tried implementing a new fine for late rent which was a breach of contract and they only changed it back once they were threatened with legal action. The apartment complex is split into two wards. The ward I'm in is really nice and fun but there will be a mass exodus come Fall as a lot of people are moving out due to the Redstone price hikes (my private room is $380 per month plus utilities right now but will shoot up to $540 base next year). Maintenance from what I've heard around the ward is slow to fix anything. It used to be a good deal because it is so close to campus, but I highly recommend you avoid signing here.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m not a BYU student, but I will be taking the Tagalog FLATS exam offered by BYU to fulfill the language GenEd at my university. \n\nI searched through the BYU sub about the FLATS exam, but a lot of the results are from a couple years ago, so I wanted to ask how the exam is overall recently (or what are recent things you\u2019ve heard about the exam). \n\nFor context, Tagalog is my native language, so there really isn\u2019t much I should worry about. However, my concern is that if the exam contains Shakespearean level Tagalog words that even a native speaker can\u2019t understand.",

I think you\u2019ll be fine so long as you\u2019re able to eliminate all Taglish. Also look out for dialogue mistakes. A friend from Rizal lost a lot of points with d/r substitutions that he didn\u2019t realize weren\u2019t official.\n\n[edit]Just noticed you were specifically asking about recent stuff, sorry. Feel free to ignore this entirely",

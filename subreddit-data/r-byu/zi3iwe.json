            "comment": "490 classes are usually restricted enrollment, meaning you either have to interview for the class or speak with the instructor. I\u2019m assuming you haven\u2019t because they usually will give a syllabus to look over when you meet with them. \n\nGrading for those classes tends to vary the ones I have taken have been P/F. I am taking another that will be on a grade scale. \n\nIt looks like he is teaching a pre-phd self study course. I would imagine it is one of the prerequisites for 585. I would assume that you would cover econometrics and CAPM stuff. Could get math heavy. I\u2019d reach out to to see if it\u2019s in your best interest before embarking on that path.",

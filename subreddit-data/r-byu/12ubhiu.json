    "postText": "I am an animation pre-major. I bit off more than I could chew this semester because I was an idiot and thought I could take a full set of classes while working two jobs and planning my own wedding.\n\nI failed the 'Living A Good Life' class because I couldn't prioritize my time right, and now I am terrified.\n\nWill the animation program even take me if I failed a class? It isn't required for my major, I was just taking it so I would have enough credit hours to live on campus because I couldn't afford anywhere else. Am I really about to lose all of my hard work because I failed that class?  \nEverybody keeps telling me different answers about what I should do, some are saying I'll be fine and others are saying I should just give up and switch to another university, and my academic advisor hasn't gotten back to me. \n\nWhat do I do?! I fee like I am about to have a panic attack!",

The \\~20% acceptance rate is based off of quality first; then instructor experience with you, attitude, interaction with your peers, etc.\n\nMy recommendation is that if you haven't scheduled office hours with one of the animation full-time faculty to review your portfolio and for them to get to know you, do that immediately. Find out their office hours and schedule it, then get your portfolio put together in a PP or PDF for review. They will tell you pretty clearly what is strong, weak, needs some work, original, and give you direction heading forward.\n\nYou don't even have to mention that other class. Chances are they won't ever know or care.",

I've referred countless students to meet and review their portfolios with full-time faculty and often review them myself.\n\nIt is not out of the ordinary to hear statements from instructors like, \"I told them not to include that one\", or things similar. It's pretty normal. Even 7 years ago as a student myself I showed my portfolio work multiple times to multiple instructors and visiting artists.\n\nI'm sorry your experience is unique and different, or you were told wrong, or maybe even hold a different opinion, or the practice changed back and forth, or it is a one-off. I'd recommend trying a different instructor until you find one that will if you really need the extra help.",

The consensus was that the illustration students have never heard that amongst the program and faculty and all of them had regularly reviewed their portfolio in one way or another. The animation students heard basically what you did, especially when tied to Kelly. However, there are some instructors that are a little bit more open to reviewing portfolios and individual pieces than others. It does seem to be more of a reserved process than in illustration.\n\nThere's a little bit of speculating we could do, as to why: Like, whoever is heading the charge of the individual program and who happens to be full-time faculty at the moment. Additionally, animation gets closer to 60-70 applicants in June, whereas illustration gets around 45, so the load is obviously heavier. Portfolios might also be repetitive right now and so they want students to explore with less guidance, which would make sense. \n\nRegardless, I think you brought up an important clarifier and something to consider when seeking feedback and progress specifically for the animation program.",

But some day, like I can now, you can look back and it won't be such a big deal.  Keep working. Even if you have to change direction in life (I had to choose a different major because of my grades).  \n\nI'm now 43, I have a career, retirement savings, my mortgage will be paid off this year, and my family is great.  My failed classes were just a minor setback in life looking back.",

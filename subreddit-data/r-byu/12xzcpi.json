For example, and engineering degree makes sense because an employer is not going to be equipped to teach you calculus and physics; a university is. The employer can then train you on more specific things for the job (e.g. send you to training for the particular CAD package they use).  \n\n\nBut I do think the \"college is much more than a job training\" mantra is a BIG problem in our society. I think that this mentality of romanticizing college is just as much to blame for the student loan crisis as predatory lending.  \n\n\nIt is not my intention to single you out for this opinion. I personally blame boomers for this terrible advice, as well as a bunch of other gems such as \"follow your passion\", \"first get the GenEds out of the way\", \"pick your major in your 2nd year\", \"get good grades instead of internships or working\", for example. I know all of these are given with good intentions but this is all terrible and outdated advice that reflects a workforce that is very different than the one we have today.",

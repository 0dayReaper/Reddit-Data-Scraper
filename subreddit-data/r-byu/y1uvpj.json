    "postText": "Hey guys! I have to take three more religion classes and then I\u2019m done! My next semesters are gonna be very challenging so I\u2019d appreciate any suggestions of the easiest religion  classes you\u2019ve taken. I\u2019d love it if they were online classes, but in-person works too.\n\nI\u2019m looking for classes with a study guide for exams and hopefully open book and stuff. (The less the reading assignments, the better) \n\nThank you in advance! \ud83d\ude4f",

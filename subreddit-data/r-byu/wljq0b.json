            "comment": "Hey, I was actually talking to my friend about this. We were thinking it would be cool to set up a homeless week event. It would involve renting out a large park in Provo (like Kiwanis Park), and people could stay there during the time they were homeless. There could be food trucks, storage pods that people could rent to keep their stuff, and there would obviously be police to patrol. It would also involve getting various charities involved that people could donate to. This would enable students to have a safe place to go, raise awareness about \u201chomeless week,\u201d and raise awareness about actual homeless people and enable people to donate to those charities or even sign up to help in some areas of the charities have something like that. My friend and I were talking about it, but I\u2019m not sure how to start the process. Any thoughts?",

Lease starts on May 1st, so she's staying with her cousin and I'm couchsurfing with a few old roommates. \n\nThen I test COVID positive, April 29th. Besides feeling like crap, I don't want to expose my friends, and her cousin has little kids. We convince housing to let me in early, and we're married on the hill above the duck pond. In attendance is our singles ward bishop, two witnesses, and one witness's wife. We livestream it for coworkers and family. \n\n(More a covid story than a homeless week story, but it was definitely a complicating factor. I also had a good friend who'd go camping and rabbit hunting between each semester, sleeping in his car when it got too cold)",

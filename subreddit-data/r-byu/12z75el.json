I don't remember addresses, I don't know people's info for references... I guess what I am asking is how vague can my information be, or do I really have to do some deep digging to find ALL the info about where I was in addition to the contact info and physical addresses of people that knew me during that time? Thanks!",

So that\u2019s what will show on a background check with customs or some other agency.  You can add an explanation paragraph if you\u2019re concerned.   The security clearance people are all very familiar with the LDS mission process at this point.   They\u2019ll understand.  Just be as thorough as you can be.",

But I have heard that you can contact the mission home and they should have that historical info. \n\nI'm sure the investigator was pissed going through my form because of how much I moved around in the 10 years. But, hopefully they got a little taste of the pain we all go through. Haha. Good luck.",

If you genuinely don't have contact with anyone from the mission anymore, you don't have to put them down. If you do though, best to put down as much info as you can, even if you have to ask them for it. You may be asked in your interview about why you didn't put down very many people, just answer truthfully and earnestly and you'll be fine.",

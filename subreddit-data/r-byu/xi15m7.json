            "comment": "The health center may be able to help you or the counseling center can help as well. From my experience the health center is more of a physiatrist experience with medicine options where the counseling center will be more of a psychological counseling experience. I have heard positive things about the group counseling options as well which let you work with others going through similar challenges. \n\nThe whole valley is backed up on counseling so it can be rough. Find people to talk to and don\u2019t hesitate to reach out for emergency services if things get bad. Everyone\u2019s brain is different and there is nothing wrong having depression. You didn\u2019t choose it but you can make it through. Start with the resources on campus and then as you need move on to broader resources in the wider community. \n\nYou are not alone and you are loved.",

Unfortunately they are pretty backed up usually. If you have good insurance, I would ask them for recommendations and call around to see who can fit you in first.",

CAPS (counseling and psychological services) is a really good resource. \n\nhttps://caps.byu.edu/make-an-appointment\n\n(801) 422-3035\n\nOr just walk into their office: Go into the Wilk via the double doors at Brigham Square, go left and down the stairs, and walk straight down the hall.",

They\u2019ll see you for a few appointments, but they\u2019re more like a crisis intervention than counseling.\n\nIf money is a problem, ask your bishop about therapists that the church will cover.

            "comment": "Get blood work done first. I didn\u2019t have depression, but it was vitamin deficiencies and hypothyroidism. Misdiagnosed for a year. Brain fog was so bad I slurred my words sometimes. You might want to consider counseling only if it is emotionally induced instead of a physical problem. Rule that out first because you don\u2019t want to waste money on counseling if you don\u2019t need it.\n\nVitamins/things to check: \nB complex vitamins (B6, B12, etc) - if you have low B vitamins but are eating plenty of B vitamin sources, you may have MTHFR \nLook into vitamin D\nThyroid hormone\n\nIf it\u2019s emotional, get a counselor that is legit and not someone whose practice is shoddy. So many counselors do not know what they are doing and often don\u2019t help or can make things worse. If you see a psychiatrist, explain your symptoms in detail. Some depression is anxiety induced and some is anhedonic which basically means being emotionally numb and you don\u2019t feel like anything is fun but your nervous system isn\u2019t stimulated highly as with anxiety induced depression. There are different antidepressant sets used for each set of symptoms. They cross somewhat, but you don\u2019t want to take the wrong drug for a month and a half and get worse symptoms only to then try the correct type or worse try another wrong one. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t doing so right now, start an exercise regimen and get enough sleep. It doesn\u2019t have to be huge, it could start out as \u201cI am going to get to the gym at this time everyday\u201d and you don\u2019t need to have a game plan but start to develop one. Just the simple goal to start exercising because it helps just as much as counseling or antidepressants according to many studies. Getting enough sleep could fix it if that is the problem. \n\nMy wife has been suicidal in a mental hospital and I had that year of hell with the misdiagnosis. So I take it seriously and have done a lot of research. You need to have some goals in mind to get where you want to go. \n\nAlso, listen to this:\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/0d8QUE4aopMQEZUrTd9MjX?si=yClHiwCeQ2SK_n9RvNHgAw",

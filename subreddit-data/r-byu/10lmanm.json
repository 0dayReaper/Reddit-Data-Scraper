    "postText": "Over the break, between fall semester and winter semester, it was so nice to really relax. Starting back this semester has made me realize that pretty much ever since I started at BYU (which was embarrassingly long ago) I constantly stress over homework and tests and understanding everything. I make time to relax and pursue hobbies but it\u2019s hard to enjoy because no matter what, in the back of my mind, I feel like I should be doing homework or studying. All too often I can\u2019t get a good night\u2019s sleep because I\u2019m worrying about my classes, and then I\u2019m so tired when it\u2019s time to do homework, I don\u2019t have much motivation to do it. Not only that, because of how demanding it all is, I don\u2019t feel like I have any real time to pursue anything that isn\u2019t directly related to my classes. It doesn\u2019t help that I feel like almost everyone around me is smarter and harder working than I am. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one that feels this way but I just so want to be done with my degree and move on to a career, but that\u2019s still a long way off. I guess I could use some advice.",

That feeling was especially bad my freshman year, but I learned that even though you want to finish school soon, it\u2019s not worth it to feel so tired and sometimes miserable. I work two jobs and have a full time student load, but I\u2019ve found ways to enjoy my life and do well in my clases. As soon as I realized I control my schedule rather than let it control me, I felt so much better. Let go of things that overload your schedule where you can\u2019t handle it and keep doing what makes you happy. Also, I realized that others around me may seem smarter or work harder, but everyone is going through the grind together. You got this! Winter semester is going to fly by and before you know it, it\u2019ll be summer.",

It's tough, especially when you know you have something you could be working on. Me for example, I got so many books to read \ud83d\ude2d but alas. I get really anxious but with school I think I just look at big picture and longterm. If I don't do great on this assignment, am I doomed? no? Ok I won't stress too much. Or If I'm really feeling low, I just think \"worst case scenario I end with this grade, and that is ok.\" Even after failing, a class can always be retaken. \n\nI'm one to stress over the dumbest things and be anxious about them all day, but for some reason I'm able to procrastinate that feeling until I sit down to work lol. idk school has been going ok for me. I would advise that you *do* take time to have fun and relax. Maybe plan something a few days out so you have something to look forward to. I always look forward to fridays and saturdays cus my friends get together, and I normally find sometime during the weekend to get some homework done. idk i hope this is somewhat helpful",

What's helped me as a CS major (hours and hours of coding projects all the time) is countering my intrusive thoughts of \"What if I don't get it done? I should be working on such-and-such project or I'll fail. I should be studying right now\" with, \"I'll get it done. If I get it done a little late, it won't wreck my grade. I need to take breaks or I'll get burned out and be even less productive. What's the worst that could happen? I don't get an A? I fail the class? That's hardly the worst thing that I'll have been through.\"\nIt's all about putting things in perspective, and practice. Counseling has helped a lot too, since I have this bad habit of placing my self-worth on my grades.",

            "comment": "Your feelings are valid but like the other posters here have said you are not the only one who feels overwhelmed. I first want to tell you that you have already achieved a great deal and there is bo reason to not be proud of what you have done while at BYU. Yes, perhaps it has not met the expectations you has when you started and clearly you hold yourself to a high bar. I sounds like that desire to achieve has been twisted into a thought that you are not good enough or even that you are an imposter. Why? Because so many people don\u2019t communicate their struggles. I can guarantee, with a few exceptions, that there are thousands of students in your shoes at BYU. Now that is cold comfort to know everyone else is going through what you are going through without a suggestion of how to alleviate some of that feeing of imposter syndrome. So some suggestions. \n\nKeep communicating- To professors, peers, your family and friends\n\nGive up perfection- Cs get degrees and Bs will get you into grad school. Most employers only care about the diploma not the report card. You already won the grade race. Now os the time to learn. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to change or rest- Sure there is a max number of credits you can take but not a max amount of time it is okay to take a real break and work or rest. You can even change things up. UVU has open enrollment and the classes are much less rigorous than BYU it is bot failure just a strategic pivot. Or do a study abroad and enjoy exploring the world while learning. \n\nTurn to mindfulness- Take time for you. Meditation, prayer, long walks, a temple session on your own, or listening to music that inspires you can all give you an outlet to recenter yourself. \n\nLastly be okay with who you are- \nWhen I was a student, many years ago, I felt like a failure. My grades were terrible no matter how I tried. I changed my major, then my potential master\u2019s program got canceled at BYU, I worked myself to the bone because I couldn\u2019t afford tuition, couldn\u2019t find someone to date, but finally I decided to tell myself, \u201cNo matter what happens, I am okay with it and I\u2019ll make it through.\u201d \n\nI did graduate with a 2.99, which meant no Grad school but eventually I got into one and now am working towards a doctorate. I got a career in my field, and eventually got married. Things are still not perfect but that is okay. \n\nYour journey may be different but statistically with 30k other students you really aren\u2019t alone. Keep working on yourself and communicating and no matter what happens you\u2019ll get through this. \n\nThanks for being vulnerable enough to share and know you are cared for. We are rooting for you.",

I feel way more motivated to finish, my mental health is better, I found a lot of direction. It was a hard decision because I only have 17 more credits but now I\u2019m in month 9 I do not regret it at all!\n\nI also support the idea of talking to CAPS! \n\n\nGodspeed!

Do something to help others, or just stop by to say hello to your ministering brothers/sisters. Doing good to others will bring you peace and happiness.\n\nYou also might just need to take time off. Go out with friends every once in a while. It's part of being a healthy adult. It'll take time to adjust especially with impending due dates, but it will be okay.\n\nWhen I was panicking about school when I was in high school, my Dad told me this:\n\n&gt;*You're in a boat with many, many holes in the ocean. You don't have a bucket, tape or anything to close the holes or scoop out the water other then your own two hands.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Except, that's technically not true.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*You turn to the man in while robes by your side, and beg for help. You then plug in one or two holes with either of your hands. However, you don't turn away from the man in the white robes.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The water stops rushing in, and you stop sinking into the dark depths.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Still trusting in the man in white, you continue on until you finally land home.*\n\n***Do what you can, the best you can, and with faith in the Lord, He will aid and support you in your righteous desires and actions. Do your best, and He will do the rest.***",

            "comment": "Everyone is giving great support and advice. I'd recommend along with looking into CAPS, asking them for a consultation session as the waitlist for therapy with CAPS is really long. Consultations will help you find a community therapist you can likely get into faster. I would also ask the UAC (accessibility center) about possibly getting an anxiety diagnosis (ask CAPS about this too, I'm sure one of them does it), and getting accommodations for that. They have helped me soooo much. And lastly, if things get too overwhelming, you can always call 988 which is the national suicide prevention line, or if that doesn't fit the bill, there's a place near the ice rink called Wasatch Behavioral Health Recieving Center that will take you for free for up to 24 hours, and give you free therapy and food and a break from everything. If you're going outside of normal business hours, call first, as they lock the door and you have to press a certain button for them to let you in.\nAlso feel free to reach out if you need an overwhelm buddy.",

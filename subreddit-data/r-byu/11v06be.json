    "postText": "I graduated high school in 2018, and in early 2019 I did one semester at BYU-I, where I had a death in the family and my grades plummeted. I never did withdraw from those courses, and ended with a 0.88 GPA for those 13 attempted credits. Later that year I served a mission, and came home when the Covid pandemic started. I would then work full time, and attend a reputable Community College near home, where I now have a 4.0 GPA with honors and 34 Credits. This brings my total GPA to 3.14 between the two schools. Is there anything I should do or say on my application before trying to apply for fall?",

In my case it\u2019s been nearly 4 years lol. \n\nWhat I am considering is doing the spring semester at Idaho online and retaking those failed classes, and petitioning for an academic renewal. This would nullify that semester since 4 years will have elapsed since.\n\nThe issue is the timing. The fall semester transfer application deadline for BYU is in late June, and that Idaho online semester wouldn\u2019t end until mid-late July. So it would still show as Fs for that semester when I apply.\n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019d be best to do that Idaho online semester this summer, do the BYU Flex GE program this fall, while I formally apply for Winter 2024?\n\nI suppose I can always apply with my current GPA for the fall, and if that fails, apply for Winter 2024 in a much stronger position. Can\u2019t hurt to try I guess.",

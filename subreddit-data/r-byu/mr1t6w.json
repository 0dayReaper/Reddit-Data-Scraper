Their mascot is the Bulldogs, hence Bulldog Ave. When that building was acquired by BYU they soon changed the name of the street.\n\nTo be fair, I graduated last year and moved away so I may not be up with what things are called now. I still remember being shocked when I came home from my mission and was laughed at for calling Heritage Halls \"New Heritage.\"",

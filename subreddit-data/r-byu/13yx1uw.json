    "postText": "I\u2019m a CS major taking 236 in the winter which I\u2019ve heard is similar to 290. Are they basically the same class or is there a significant difference?\n\nI don\u2019t need the credit for anything, I\u2019ve just heard it\u2019s a rewarding but hard class, which is almost enough to persuade me to just take it. However, I\u2019m probably not taking another math class after it except some statistics so idk if it would be time well spent. I\u2019m taking multivariable calculus right now, and it\u2019s been a nightmare, but I think that\u2019s more because of the professor than anything. \n\nWhat\u2019s your experience with math 290? Was it worth it? Did it blow your mind and change your whole perspective of math? Or am I better off just taking another class? What professor would you recommend?",

But also, 290 is a really intense class, I wouldn't take it if you don't need to. \n\nThen again, if you take 290, maybe you'll be convinced to switch to the ACME program. They say if you enjoy Math 290, then ACME is a really good fit for you.",

I think it would have been helpful, but hard to say for sure.\n\nI did enjoy the class, helped me with learning some fundamentals of how to think mathematically and be able to get into reading research papers. I think it's also part of doing a math minor if that's of interest. After 290, I think you just need multivariable calculus and then one other math elective like cryptography.",

If you're taking it just to take the class, I'd personally pass and just stick with 236. 290 is intense and for me was too much. 236 with Barker (I took it from him last Winter semester) was a 10/10 experience, he explained things so well. The coding projects applied the principles taught in class and I liked seeing that what we learned was applicable and why it mattered.",

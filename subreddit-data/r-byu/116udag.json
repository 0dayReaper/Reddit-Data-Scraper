    "postText": "So I am a senior and have realized I haven't attended or even heard of really any events other than Homecoming, and even then I missed Homecoming this year. I know the Traditions Gala hosted by the BYU Alumni is open to everyone, but the Honors Gala is also coming up Friday. Anyone can technically buy a ticket, but is it actually open to non-Honors program students? I considered/qualify for the program but just thought it was unnecessary/not worth it.",

But I agree with you, BYU could definitely use some more formal events to spice things up. Campus life often feels so casual. It\u2019s fun to have a fancy dress up evening to remind ourselves we are at a university!",

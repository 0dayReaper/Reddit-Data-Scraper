    "postText": "So I\u2019m in the Asian Studies: Japan Studies BA and I\u2019m currently taking 200 level Japanese classes. I\u2019m a senior this year though, and I need to graduate next year. In order to take the classes required for my major, I need to have taken the two 300 level classes. Which I had planned to take spring/summer but just found out it\u2019s not being offered. They also don\u2019t have it as an option for independent study. Anyone know what I can do? \n\nI\u2019ve considered an independent trip to Japan with a tutor so I can take the Japanese comprehension test to bypass the requirement, but that would be pretty expensive and I\u2019d like to explore my options first.",

I would suggest that you make an appointment and set a graduation plan with your major's academic advisor. My advisor and I made a roadmap of exactly when you're taking which classes so you don't spend another year of your life in undergrad because of 1 silly class.",

            "comment": "Sometimes you can apply to take classes at another university as a visiting student, then use those credits for your own university. So, same idea as you had, but you could look at the U or any Utah college, or other colleges in the US. Could also look at EdX, Coursera, Harvard Extension School stuff like that, to see if any of their courses count as college credit.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to double and triple check with the registrar and with your advisor to make sure that it\u2019ll work, but I think it\u2019s definitely possible to find something that would work. Community colleges might have the cheapest stuff although I wonder to what extent they would have upper division Japanese classes. \n\nIf you have someone who is already an ally to you in the department, like a professor or chair or dean, all the better. They should be willing to work with you, especially given the circumstances. Good luck!",

It looks like it would be Japanese 490 in this case, although I'm not sure if they require you to be at a more advanced level than you currently are. You should either ask a specific faculty member if they would be willing to work with you over the spring or summer or talk to the department chair to see what they would recommend. \n\nIt's kind of dicey to take a class from another institution unless you get BYU to sign off on it in advance.",

When I transferred to BYU, I found out that a few engineering classes wouldn't be accepted and I would have to spend an extra year in my undergrad. It sucked, but I made it out the other side just fine. \n\nAlso, having gone through the Japanese program myself, I wouldn't advise rushing through it. The 300 level classes can be challenging.",

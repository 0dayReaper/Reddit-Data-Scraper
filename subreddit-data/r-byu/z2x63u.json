            "comment": "Its not an incredibly difficult class if you've had any exposure to stats before, even just generally in high school.\n\nWhat makes it hard is the professor. Do not take the class from Fellingham, if he's teaching the course. Avoid him at all costs, literally the worst professor I ever had at BYU. He doesn't necessarily make the material difficult (I got a good grade), but he is an incredibly rude, combative and belligerent individual who is borderline abusive to students at times. \n\nI'm not exaggerating, I had to stop attending my class because it got so bad. I am not embellishing at all in these anecdotes: he would pause class to yell at people coming in even 2 minutes late, for sometimes over 5 minutes of him just going off. Many class periods this resulted in 20-30 minutes of off-topic yelling and lecturing about \"disrespect\" and \"distractions\" and other nonsense because multiple people came in late (quietly, I might add). A couple students called him out over his behavior and he got in a nasty verbal fight with them and hurled insults. Racially profiled a couple students in class and in front of everyone. Kicked people out of class for having any 5 o'clock shadow. Day 1, literally told us he didn't care about our class and was angry that the department head was making him teach that section. \n\nI ended up just not attending class and just studying the textbook/homeworks and exams, and did fine.\n\nI know myself and other students submitted formal complaints about his behavior but nothing ever came of it.\n\nAll of that to say, choose your professor wisely and the class isn't too hard :)",

That\u2019s why it\u2019s in the stat department, not the math department. \n\nReese, Christensen, and Blades were also excellent professors for 121. I was a course assistant so I was exposed to most of them. This was a few years back. Not sure who all is still there.",

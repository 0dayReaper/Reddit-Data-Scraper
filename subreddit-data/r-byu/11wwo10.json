About how far in advance would we be able to rent a home? Say we're looking to move in late July, when would be the soonest we be able to sign a contract?",

            "comment": "It really comes down to how you find the rental. Most houses are betting on their tenants renewing leases, which most of the time they do. They won't post listings online until they are out of leads from their existing tenants or referrals, so they won't post them until about a month before the current lease ends.\n\nThat being said, your best bet is to look for rentals available about the month before you are ready to move, or to reach out to property management companies directly to see if they have any potential availabilities.\n\nHouse renting is a whole different ball game over apartments where the leases are far more predictable and are incredibly cyclical in a college town. Best of luck to you!",

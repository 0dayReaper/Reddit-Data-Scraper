    "postText": "I was wondering if anyone had any experience/knowledge on this matter. A year and a half back (Winter Semester 2021) I was having some major mental health problems that seriously inhibited my ability to succeed in school. I was seeing a therapist during that semester, but never thought to get accommodations (partially because I was barely keeping my head above water, and I was not completely aware of the resources that were available to me). While I maybe should have withdrawn, I didn't. I passed both of the 2 classes I was taking, but got bad grades that are really hurting my GPA (Ds). I had heard a while back from a friend that you could have the accommodations office go back in and mark those grades as P/F if you have documentation from your therapist at the time for extenuating circumstances. If that is not the case, do I have any form of recourse besides retaking the courses? Thank you!\n\nEdit: I am still seeing the same therapist.",

Every time I ever had to submit a petition or ask for help digitally, it took forever for me to get a response and I had one or two nightmares experiences where someone was really mean about it, including the time housing once told me I was stealing space at byu from students who were \"more worthy.\" Ouch. (I don't say this to scare you; I had some extreme circumstances and had to submit petitions or ask for help five or six times, so I did it a lot and maybe people were tired of me.) But talking to people in person always went so much better. I know that doing things in person can be scary and difficult, but it is worth it. Everyone I know who went through the system got better care that way.",

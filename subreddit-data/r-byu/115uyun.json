They\u2019re rad. \nMake sure that y\u2019all are wearing stuff that you don\u2019t mind getting damaged incase any of the sparks land on you. I bought a big, thick hoodie to wear. Ideally you want cotton because polyester will melt. \n\n- Plunj is a fun relaxing date. It\u2019s a Scandinavian style spa where you alternate between a dry sauna for 10-15 mins and cold tubs for 3-5 mins. I miss that place so much, I\u2019d go there without dates just to relax. \n\n- The Museum of Art is always cool. They get new stuff in there at least every few months and it\u2019s free.",

BYU has huge donors that keep coming back simply because we don\u2019t put up big parking garages or huge lots, even though we could really use them. That\u2019s why BYU has invested so much into public transportation instead as well as accommodating bikes.",

You have all public transportation completely free. Maybe use that to your advantage?\n\n99% of the time, people don't need to drive to campus. If they have work and such, that'd be an exception, but I promise you most students aren't this exception.\n\nThis isn't a popular opinion, but cars are not the future. The air quality can get quite bad (even though it's been relatively good this year). Cars are inefficient in transportation and make pollution worse. Electric cars still create traffic and cause cars to be inefficient. Buses and trains, which again, happen to be free for BYU students, are there for you.",

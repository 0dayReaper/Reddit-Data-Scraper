    "postText": "Nearly one third of your bachelor's degree is made up of generals. AKA classes that you only take because you have to. Among these are 14 religion credits, 6 civ credits, math, arts, science, history, writing, and others.\n\nRegardless of your major, you probably won't use half of those in your life. Also, if you were born in the church and served a mission, you probably know enough about the gospel to be able to teach the required religion classes, making taking them a waste of time.\n\nIn my opinion, generals should be minimal and dictated by your major rather than be required from everyone. It makes sense for an architecture major to be required to take calculus, but it doesn't make sense for an art major to be required to take it. Likewise, a comp sci major doesn't need to learn about Shakespeare.\n\nI think it would be better if the students, which are the ones paying $20k in tuition, had more freedom to decide what classes they took while at BYU. What are your thoughts?",

I'd guess those with degrees in Biochemistry, Engineering, Accounting, Nursing etc you use a lot of what you learn if you actually work in that field later. But since many majors have less defined career paths and tons of people take jobs in fields unrelated to their major, yeah a lot of the degree becomes proving you can be responsible.",

Yes, learning skills for the workplace is an important part of an undergraduate degree, but being exposed to disciplines outside of your tastes helps you become a more well-rounded individual. If you don't like the idea of holistic liberal education, there are community colleges and trade schools where you can take a more \u00e0 la carte approach to the classes you take. \n\nAlthough I ended up majoring in business, there are so many valuable things I learned from my general education classes, and I am really glad I took them. My advice if you're burnt out from learning about seemingly irrelevant things is to learn to find satisfaction in learning just for the sake of learning.",

Most people who take BYU religion classes are RMs and/or lifelong members, so they tend to be tailored to an already knowledgeable audience, which makes them pretty interesting IMO. Anecdotally, as an RM and a lifelong church member, I can tell you that every religion class I took added to my understanding of the gospel in a way that I don't think I could have achieved without them.",

A lack of understanding about civics and history is also a disaster. Look no further than our current political atmosphere if you have any doubts about that statement.\n3. The fine arts and the humanities are incredibly enriching and a celebration of everything that makes us human. Learning to appreciate them makes them a little more enjoyable and you a little less boring. Also, writing is a greatly underappreciated skill; the number of misspelled, grammatically incorrect, and generally poorly formulated emails I've seen never ceases to amaze me.\n\nUltimately, a broad education makes it possible to understand and appreciate a broad variety of people and their talents. I've got friends who are teachers, artists, musicians, scientists, engineers, machinists, etc., and there are few things better than seeing that little glow that pops up in their face when I can talk to them, even in some small simple way, about what they do.",

For example writing is something needed in all majors and while the majors do have specific writing courses the basics for many of the majors are the same. Having each department teach a general course is inefficient and instead focusing on having generals that apply to many departments saves labor and makes sure the department can focus on its specific needs. \n\nYou are correct that perhaps an artist doesn't need calculus(Though math makes beautiful art) but if they tailor their generals to their program they might choose statistics or accounting to help them with the business of art. You may think an engineer or comp sci major doesn't need Shakespeare but they'll need to be able to communicate with non-engineers so advanced communication courses are useful. Shakespeare might give them something more interesting to learn to communicate with than a dull grammar class. \n\nWhile we are in college we are often stove-piped into a specific major after you leave college the work place is full of people of all sorts of backgrounds, education levels, who have had training in myriad things which are not covered by any one major but general education gives us the tools to communicate across these disciplines. Your English classes as a an computer engineer will help you explain your work to the accountant who is looking at your budgets, the marketing department that will sell you product, and the business manager who is the CEO of your company.   \n\n\nFinally there are a lot of students who arrive at BYU who don't know what major they want or who after taking some parts of a major discover that that major is not for them. General classes help them to progress in any major and change as necessary without undoing the work they have done before. These general classes also serve as introductions to possible majors for them helping the student focus their vision.   \n\n\nYes, like many of the folks posting here have said trade schools doe this pretty efficiently by just having you focusing on the outcome of learning a specific set of skill in a specific field but we're here at a university which has a different model and is chosen for different reasons.",

I'm not a fan of English classes and most humanities. Yet, I'm taking an art history class this semester and find it incredibly interesting. The point of a university is to produce individuals with specialized knowledge in a certain field, but also knowledge in a great number of other fields. Imagine talking to a college-educated individual who doesn't know about classical texts like the Aeneid or the Odyssey, or who doesn't know how to write a proper research paper. That's an issue for higher education.\n\n\"You take generals outside your major so that you\u2019re well-rounded and well-educated. This is why it\u2019s called a university instead of a trade school.\"",

It\u2019s surface level enough that I essentially know no more no about Astronomy than I did before I began, but busy enough that I waste a significant amount of time taking small quizzes and writing paragraph response assignments.",

    "postText": "With Utah's Sterling Scholar Competition I was able to get my tuition covered for my first year, but when looking online about future year scholarships it wasn't very clear. Some sources I saw said having high credits each semester gave chances for more scholarships and others said GPA. Should I take a lighter course load for a high GPA or is having high credit count important for future scholarships? ",

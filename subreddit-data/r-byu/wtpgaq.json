If you feel like there\u2019s a way to separate these classes without delaying your application, then I see no reason to do that. However, CELL 220 is a prerequisite for CELL 305, so keep that in mind. Your advisor might\u2019ve suggested this schedule so you can apply to the program on time. Other comments mentioned these classes aren\u2019t too hard, and while I agree that they\u2019re certainly doable, understand that BYU classes are going to require more effort than high school. Just block out enough studying time and you\u2019ll be fine. Im saying all of this with the assumption you\u2019re an incoming freshman, but if you\u2019re not then you can treat them just like any other science classes at BYU.",

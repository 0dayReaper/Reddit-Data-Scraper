Despite the fact that my essays were fairly strong, I have seen other people's metrics on this site and they seem to be much stronger than mine. I honestly don't know how I managed to get in with my stats when some people had far better ones. Is it because I practice Catholicism and not from Utah?",

It sounds like they've relaxed it so it's easier for locals to get in. \n\nEssays are one of the biggest factors in admissions.  It sounds like once your GPA/test scores are above a certain threshold, the essay is usually determines whether you get in or not.\n\nNot LDS helps.  Non-LDS applicants do have a higher admittance rate, but BYU isn't always their first choice so they're more likely to go to another school compared to LDS students unless they're looking for a dry campus (eg, quite a few Muslims at BYU).  I BYU wants a bit more religious diversity in the student body.\n\nKeep in mind the laws of averages--if the average ACT score of incoming freshmen is ~27 (85th percentile), then for every applicant admitted with a 31+ (90th percentile) there will be a 23 (75% percentile).\n\nSeems like you're a good student and would do fine academically at BYU.",

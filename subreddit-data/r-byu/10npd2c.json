I didn\u2019t do the best in terms of grades during high school, and got  pretty low act and sat scores. I\u2019m just about to finish my associates from uvu this spring, and I\u2019m curious as with a degree how much higher my chances would be for acceptance at BYU. Thoughts? (and no I didn\u2019t serve)",

BYU didn't need to see my high school grades because the associates degree was sufficient enough credits. In my experience, your chances are way better getting into BYU with an associates degree, I remember hearing somewhere that transfer students have roughly a 50% acceptance rate? Not positive on that though.",

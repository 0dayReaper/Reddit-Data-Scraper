            "comment": "My personal opinion is that all of these Latin-named organizations are scams. They provide two things: a resume filler and a way to network. \n\nThe resume filler might be worth the $100 (or whatever it is nowadays) if you don't have a lot of other worthwhile things to put on your resume. But it's only worth it for a few years until you've built up your resume enough with other, more impactful stuff. There might be an employer who has a weird obsession with their organization, and it greatly influences their decision to hire you, but that probably won't ever happen.  \n\nAs for networking, there are plenty of other opportunities to network that don't involve paying an organization. And if you are going to pay an organization, choose one that is specific to your major, like APA for psychology, or IEEE/ACM for computer-related majors. These will provide much better networking opportunities than whatever random people choose to be in these slightly exclusive clubs.",

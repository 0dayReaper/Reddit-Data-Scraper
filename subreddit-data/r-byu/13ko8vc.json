            "comment": "Sadly there isn\u2019t an payment plan for tuition at BYU. I work in BYU\u2019s Financial Services office and typically what we recommend is taking out a Short Term loan through BYU (it\u2019s found on the My Financial Center page). There\u2019s a $20 fee, but essentially you can loan the exact cost of your tuition and the deadline to pay it all back is like 2/3 of the way through the semester you\u2019re paying for. If you don\u2019t pay it back, there\u2019s a hold placed on your account and you can\u2019t register for classes the following semester. \n\nOn very *very* rare occasions (I\u2019ve seen it like twice in the two years I\u2019ve worked there) they set up installments plans if you\u2019re able to go into collections from overdue charges, but I\u2019ve never seen it for tuition. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any difference for international students, so I apologize if any of this is wrong, but it\u2019s generally the same guidelines for everyone.",

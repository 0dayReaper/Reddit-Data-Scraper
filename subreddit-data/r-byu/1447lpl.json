    "postText": "Hi ! Currently trying to make a deposit at BYU. Any international students who could walk me  on how to choose the right payment method. FYI my financial center is showing me a couple methods (CIBC international payment and PayMyTuition) alongside using a credit card. Basically how can I compare the exchange rates, ups and downs of each method.",

You can tell them your insurance and what you're looking for in a therapist (I was also looking for a therapist who worked with LGBTQ students, and I know that's not an uncommon request for them), and they'll recommend some non-CAPS therapists who might work for you. It was a really positive experience for me; I stayed with the therapist they recommended for years until I moved out of Provo.",

I would recommend getting on the waitlist, not only will you eventually be seen, but it encourages them to make more resources available. (Particularly their group therapies.) In the meantime, the encircle, affirmation, flourish, and celebrate have great resources too. I also recommend stopping in to see Blake Fisher in what was the office of Student Success and Inclusion, but I think now might be the Office of Belonging or something. Oh, and swing by r/mormonandgay or r/byulgbtq. I wouldn\u2019t go through your bishop, many bishops haven\u2019t dealt with their internal biases and can discriminate unfairly.",

Family services has some great therapists, but the way it\u2019s wound up with the church can be problematic, especially when it comes to things like confidentiality. Many have recommended other great resources \u2014 I\u2019d pursue those first, and only use a bishop/family services as a last resort. \n\nAlso, you can look up other individual therapists. Many have experience with LGBTQ related things even if that\u2019s not their speciality. I know a great private practice therapist in Orem that is really good with queer stuff \u2014 but totally booked with a long backlog. Basically there are a lot of options.",

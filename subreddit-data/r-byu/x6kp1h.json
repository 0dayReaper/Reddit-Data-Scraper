This statement might offend the author of the posted article, but I'll say it anyway: humans *have hips and they are also sexual beings*.\n\nThere's obviously some element of cultural subjectiveness in what is regarded as overtly and implicitly sexual, but almost all dance forms (ballroom, swing, tango, hip-hop, modern) include elements that might be viewed as sexual from an ultra-sexually prude-ish perspective.  From a dancer's perspective (my wife danced in HS) legs and hips are just part of the toolbox of expression.  I concede that there is a continuum of sexual suggestiveness in dance, and I also concede that there are lines over which a dance might then become completely sexual and/or obscene according to accepted conventions of expression.  But are only straight people allowed to use the basic toolbox in their expression?  Are trans people not sexual beings with hips, too?\n\nFor the record, based on the videos posted, I would not have felt uncomfortable at all with my youngest children there (youngest daughter is 10 and youngest son is 12).  To me, that was within the scope of \"family friendly\".  I acknowledge that people can disagree on what constitutes family friendly--for instance, there are all kinds of stories in the Bible and Book of Mormon that are not \"family friendly\" that children should be protected from (e.g., human sacrifice, beheadings, cannibalism, forced circumcision, rapes, incest, genocide, etc, etc, etc).\n\nIf Cassandra Hedelius were also writing articles about the sexual nature of the BYU Cougarette dance routines, then we'd know she just has different ideas about what is appropriate dance expression in public.  Lack of outrage towards the Cougarettes suggests trans-phobia (driven by her religious ideology) as the ultimate root in this particular case [and I'm not saying anything surprising since her article explains her rationale].  It's not about the dance or its level of sexuality: it's about who is performing the dance.",

I assume you were based on your comment? \n\nIt seemed to me, based on the tribune article and others, that the goal of the local protesters was to make it publicly aware that they disagreed with the vulgar sounding names and drag show. Yeah they seemed to be pretty uncompromising and not very understanding in their allegations of grooming, etc. but when it comes down to it they had a legal right to be there. \n\nI don't agree with the protesters' approach, but I would also be very uncomfortable if I was raising a family right next to Kiwanis park. I wouldn't participate though. By being in a public location, they probably knew they would get protesters, and played their political cards to make BYU look even worse because of these people. Both things were within the legal rights of both parties.\n\nWhat I personally find more disconcerting (assuming the drag show was rather friendly and didn't use the poster names) was the event both contained a multitude of suggestions against church policy as well as attempting to associate itself with BYU.",

When the leaders of your church make statements directly opposing or attacking your friends, how do you defend that?  Like when Oaks pointed out last GC that the church will vigorously oppose laws gay marriage and transgender-affirming laws?\n\nThese are not lifestyle choices.  They are who people are, and when your church actively opposes their rights in a free society, it will be a difficult conversation.",

It\u2019s instituted by God between Man and Woman, and anything else doesn\u2019t fit the definition. It\u2019s an explicitly religious institution that government has no business getting into in the first place, and it especially has no business trying to take God\u2019s place in defining it.\n\nAnd you\u2019re conflating being LGBT and living an LGBT lifestyle. Being LGBT isn\u2019t a choice (though there is strong evidence to suggest that in many cases there is a social contagion component), but living an LGBT lifestyle IS a choice. Just like the lifestyle of an unmarried but living together couple is a choice. They didn\u2019t choose to be straight, but they did chose to behave in a manner contradictory to the commandments.",

Marriage existed long before Christianity and in many other cultures.\nSecondly even if you wanted to use your Bible to define marriage that would mean marriage is between a man and however many women he can afford to own, as well as the young sex slaves he kidnaps after killing their fathers.\nYou're a bigot, plain and simple.",

So you'll be dealing with concepts and applications of linear systems, matrices, vectors and vector spaces, linear transformations, determinants, inner product spaces, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.\n\nIn other words, you'll be fine moving on to 213.",

You'll be working with matrices and vectors until you're tired of them.\n\nIf you don't remember calculus though, Diff Eq and multivariable will be hell. Try and refresh yourself on the basics, or you will have a terrible time in both. I was quite good at calculus, and had a hard time in both.",

Diff Eq will take elements from Calc 2 and linear algebra.\n\nYou don't have to be perfect at Calc to do well in either. You will need to be able to integrate, understand series, etc. Message me if you have any questions. I also came back from a mission and had to adjust to a long math break.",

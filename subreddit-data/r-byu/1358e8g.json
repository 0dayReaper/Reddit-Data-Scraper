    "postText": "Getting married in the fall and trying to find housing. It is an absolute madhouse out here in the married housing world. We're on like 15 waitlists that don't seem to be budging. All the apartment applications require us to have an income 3x the rent.  How are poor students supposed to do that? We're going to be just barely making enough to afford housing here. And the Facebook groups are crazy, full of scammers, and when there's a legit post, apartments are claimed within a few hours. \n\nHow are yall finding and affording housing in Provo? I am feeling very discouraged.",

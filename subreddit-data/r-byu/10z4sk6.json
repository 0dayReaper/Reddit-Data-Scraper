In-person and telehealth options available! If you can't afford therapy in other spaces, let us know and there will be no cost. For folks who can pay, there is a sliding scale, but finances are never a barrier to the care we provide. Pick a time for a free phone consultation on our website to see if we might be a good fit for you!",

    "postText": "I'm thinking of taking this class for the Physical science requirement. I would take physics 100 this semester but don't have room in my schedule. But if this class isn't worth it I could drop 167 and take 100 next semester or something. I've looked on Rate my professor and he seems easy, but I was looking for more thoughts since he only has like 3 reviews.",

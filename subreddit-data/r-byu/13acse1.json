    "postText": "hello, I currently need to retake my AP World History final for BYU IS. Does anyone know if the retake is similar at all to the original final or completely different questions? I've seen posts abt the retake usually having majority of the same questions as the original just different order. I just wanted to know if it also applied to WHAP? I'm about to review/study the entire course again for the retake but I'm not sure if its worth studying the questions I remember...",

What I did myself is I printed out every single Final Quiz (not the self check Q\u2019s) and literally just went through all of them and memorized the answers to all of them. The best part of History is that it doesn\u2019t change like math. The Facts don\u2019t change so memorizing them holds up with the testing. Do it and I promise it\u2019ll be worth the paper and time. I passed with a B+ w/ this method. Memorize!",

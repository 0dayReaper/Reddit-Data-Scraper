I usually just brush it off and walk away, but this time it bothered me enough to say something. \n\nHow you can claim to be part of a religion that is based on the teachings of Christ, and then not actually follow the teachings of Christ? Are we really to the point in our Eternal Families classes that we can't even talk about eternal families? What a shame. I wish all our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters a good year, and just remember that you have more allies at BYU than you think.",

How ironic that \"defending the family\" involves people viciously attacking mothers whom they don't know and who are just trying their best to keep their kids alive",

Instead, I'm going to say that this professor doesn't deserve what she's getting, I hope she gets all the resources she needs for her child, and that both of them live happy, fulfilling lives regardless of those who would try to drag them down.",

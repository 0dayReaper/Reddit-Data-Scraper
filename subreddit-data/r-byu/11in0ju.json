            "comment": "My family moved out of the country my sophomore year of high school so I did BYU independent study online that year. For some background, I was always at the top of my class in school before this. I\u2019m not the type of person to stick to a schedule and stay consistently motivated so the program was very difficult for me. Honestly, the classes didn\u2019t seem super organized and it was hard to follow on my own. I ended up only finishing half of what I otherwise would\u2019ve finished at normal high school. Also, I ended up procrastinating a lot of the work and ended up being very bored a lot of the time which wasn\u2019t good for my mental health. \nUnless you really believe you can stay motivated and grind out all the work, I would recommend looking into other online high school programs even if they are more expensive than BYUs. I\u2019ve heard of some pretty good ones that require consistent participation and timelines to get the work done.",

I am also one of those people who have a really hard time with self-motivation and bad mental health so I will definitely need to look into some other options, do you remember how many hours of work I would need to put in a week?\n\nmy family also lives in a different country in asia, will there be any issue with time zones?",

The next year I went to an international school and it worked a lot better for me. I would also recommend finding scheduled activities wherever you live. The busier you are the healthier you will be.",

    "postText": "Hi all (but specifically hi to those familiar with the CS major). I created this flowchart to help visualize what order I needed to take CS classes to graduate the quickest possible (hopefully it shows up okay).\n\nI guess I\u2019m confused because even though I\u2019ll be entering byu with 30 credits and most of my GEs completed, it\u2019s still going to take me the full 4 years just to complete the CS courses because of how linear they are. Is there something I\u2019m missing? Is there a faster/easier way to do it?\n I\u2019ve also heard that it\u2019s ill-advised to take &gt;2 CS in a semester because of how difficult/time consuming they become, so not sure how to reconcile that with some of these semesters where I may have to take more than 2.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant, I\u2019m just looking for advice or clarification as I try and plan out my schedule.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a senior in the CS program and I think the \u201cdon\u2019t take &gt; 2 CS classes per semester\u201d rule really depends on what type of CS classes you\u2019re going to take. \n\nFor instance, \n- CS 404 is basically an easy writing/philosophy course (actually my fav course so far, because it\u2019s extremely interesting)\n- CS 252 is zero programming and all theory\n- CS 312 is a challenging mix of theory and actual programming (projects). \n\nI don\u2019t remember the prereqs and stuff for each of these, but these three courses would be manageable to take all at the same time. In my opinion, it really depends on the focus and intensity of the coursework. My suggestion is to Google \u201cBYU CS ### Syllabus\u201d, try to find recent results, and determine what classes and materials you\u2019re comfortable mixing. Like for me, I\u2019m awful with theory, so I try to limit how much of that I have to take per semester. But I\u2019m better at grinding out projects and writing assignments. So I\u2019m comfortable taking like 2 classes that are programming project heavy, and then a third class that\u2019s theory type stuff, plus whatever GEs or other courses I need that I feel could fit in that balance.\n\nFeel totally free to ask me any more questions or anything about the CS program. They\u2018ve started changing some courses and stuff, so some things are different since when I started in Fall 2020, but I\u2019m all for giving tips and sharing things I\u2019ve learned and heard about",

But I do know that not this fall, but this upcoming winter, 340 is being reworked to be \u201cweb based instead of android, and they are supposed to be cutting back on the workload as a part of that.\u201d (Per CS advisor Lynnette)\n\nSo I\u2019m waiting until Winter to take that class, lol\n\nCS 312 is like 5 or so big projects based on designing pre-existing algorithms. Some bi-weekly homework pulled from textbook questions. And exams. Overall not bad if you put in the time to study and learn what you\u2019re doing, otherwise projects and exams feel much harder",

The CS degree is basically set up that way, not much you can do to avoid having to just take the classes in this dumb slow manner. It doesn't help that sometimes my map will say a class should be offered every year or every fall and then it just... Isn't. I've loved my CS degree but I have more than one bone to pick with the way the CS department chooses to run things.\n\nAlso definitely meet with the CS Academic Advisor, she is awesome and super helpful.",

I found mine only because of a meeting she told me about.\n\nAlso that CS wants to try to update some of their curriculum but they aren't doing a great job at it. Like \"let's replace 142 with a python class but the next level class will still be all C++ based so you just have to figure out the language in a few weeks\". I'm of the opinion python is a bad first language for CS majors anyways, but you can't just go from python to C++ Data Structures. \n\nIdk why the CS department can't get their crap together in so many ways. Lots of great professors and from what I've heard one of the highest enrolled majors at BYU, but it seems so poorly mismanaged.",

CS 340 was probably my biggest thing for my current internship, and I definitely want expected to know half the stuff I half to do. It's definitely overwhelming but we will figure it out. A CS degree definitely isn't to teach you ten different languages, just to teach you good CS practices and maybe some specific skills in high level classes. Just focus on picking up what you can when you can and you'll be alright. Companies with ridiculous requirements aren't worth your time anyways.",

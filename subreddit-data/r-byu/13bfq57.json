    "postText": "Could anyone share their experiences with CAPS counseling, whether it's Individual therapy or Group therapy, good or bad?\n\nTo provide more context, the reasons that I'm seeking counseling are: Perfectionism, bad time management, socially awkward, lack of motivation &amp; confidence, don't fully fit in byu.\nAfter being waitlisted for 4 months, I started to meet with my individual therapist last week. I didn't enjoy our first appointment since he was late and I don't think he was fully engaged in our conversation; but anyways during our session I mentioned that I feel alone and don't fit in here a lot of time, and he recommended that I could try Group therapy since it'd be a good way to meet my peers with similar issues, and to make friends.\nI agree that it's nice to get peer interaction and to identify with others, but I'm worried that I won't be able to speak as much as when I get one-to-one attention since I'm very introverted (and I doubt that I can actually make friends in group therapy) Sooo I'm debating whether I should switch to group therapy or stick with the individual one... Any comments is appreciated.",

            "comment": "I had a good experience with CAPS, but unless things have changed, they only allow a max of like 5-7 sessions before they refer you out because of the monster backlog they've had. There are however 2 therapists at the student health center that probably have more availability (again, unless things have changed).\n\nETA: There was also a group called NAMI or something on campus that I went to a few times that might be what you're looking for. It was like group therapy facilitated by another student.",

Plus, since my husband had BYU health insurance, it was cheap. \n\n(We stopped because we realized that the reason we were stressed wasn't because of our marriage, it was other things so once we took care of the outside stressors, we didn't need really need therapy anymore. Plus, the guy said we were one of the strongest couples he's ever met, so that felt pretty great.)",

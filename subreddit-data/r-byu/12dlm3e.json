            "comment": "There are several options for non-music majors. University Band is non-audition, you just sign up. That happens every winter semester. \n\nThere is also marching band in the fall. It's technically auditioned but if you can manage not to sound like a flatulent garbage can you'll get in. \n\nAs a non-major you are also free to audition for either of the other two ensembles, Symphonic Band (lower tier) or Wind Symphony (higher tier). However, you will be competing with music majors. They tend to be given preference because they are required to be in an ensemble every semester. They are by far the best sounding bands on campus and a lot of fun to play with. If you want to audition, I would email the professor for your instrument and tell them you want to audition.",

They tend to be filled with primarily music majors due to the fact they likely have more practice time, but it is not exclusive at all.",

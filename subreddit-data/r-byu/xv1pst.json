Last time my wife and I were exposed to Covid in winter 2021, we did the \u201cright\u201d thing and got drive through tested at the SHC, then they added several hundred dollar charges to our student accounts. When we didn\u2019t pay, they put holds on everything. Had to escalate it all the way to the second in command at the SHC, and they were very rude but finally begrudgingly agreed to let the charges go \u201cjust this once\u201d. Last time I shove any damn thing up my nose because someone tells me to.",

    "postText": "The parking laws in Provo state that if I park my car on a public street for more than 72 hours, then my car could get towed. I don\u2019t drive a lot, but I\u2019m depending on street parking right now. The area where I\u2019m parking is all apartments with a lot of cars parked on the sides of the road. What have been your experiences? Do I really need to move my car at least 400 feet every three days?\n\nAsking here because there isn\u2019t a better subreddit for Provo, and this is an issue students in particular face.",

She didn\u2019t drive much and it was on the street in our neighborhood, a neighbor called it in and they put a slip on the car saying she had 72 hours to move it. We were on vacation so didn\u2019t get home until it was gone, unfortunately. If that\u2019s similar to Provo it means that first, a neighbor would have to be bothered by it enough to call in, and second, you\u2019d get a slip and should likely have time to move it",

            "comment": "The Provo parking crew patrols daily. They will really start to catch on to cars that aren't moving. I wouldn't roll the dice and wait for your first warning to start moving it. Every day or so just move it a little. Can be across the street or straight ahead one spot in your parallel parking. The point is that the patrol won't become familiar with your car in one spot which is a good thing. Plus cars work better when they move often. Tire rubber doesn't get flat spots, brake rotors don't develop rust. Oil gets to move around. You will hardly use gas just moving it a little bit at a time. Also, clear off the snow often as another sign that it isn't abandoned.",

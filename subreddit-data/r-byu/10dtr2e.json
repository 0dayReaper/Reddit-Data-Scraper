It\u2019s nice just knowing you have an assigned spot and no one will take it. It\u2019s an underground parking garage so you don\u2019t have to worry about scraping snow and ice off your car. I\u2019d say get on that waiting asap!",

It took me 2 months to finally get a spot, but at that point I was about to move out so it wasn\u2019t worth it for me. Besides that you can park on the street which was tough in the summer so I imagine it would be more rough during the semester.",

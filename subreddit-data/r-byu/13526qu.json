Just looking for GE's that won't kick my but or kill my GPA. Any suggestions are welcome. I'v already took ahtg, writing 150, social sciences, global/cultural awareness, and bio credits. Any suggestions are welcome. I'v dug through rate my professor already, just looking for more insights. Thank you!",

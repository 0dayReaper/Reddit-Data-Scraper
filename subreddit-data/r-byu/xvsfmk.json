He assigns a fair amount reading 30-50 pages a week. But, if you enjoy it it won\u2019t matter. It was all very interesting and relevant. The course you mentioned goes from covers Joseph smith to modern times.",

It\u2019s like your typical history class, but I really like the format of his class. You go to lecture two days a week and complete all the assignments online, including quizzes and exams. I\u2019ve really enjoyed this class so far and highly recommend!",

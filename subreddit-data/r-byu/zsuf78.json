Biochemistry was easier than my organic chemistry class at BYU. Many of the classes will be new material but if you did well in pre med classes I think you will be well prepared.",

You also learn how to study much more efficiently. Lot of that comes by using anki. First 4-6 months suck because you don\u2019t know how to handle it, but then it becomes a 9-5, so basically a normal job. Except for test weeks, that\u2019s more like a 9-8. Mileage may vary, like if you go to an Ivy League med school or something.\n\nI\u2019m very much able to balance my hobbies and relationship with my gf and school. I\u2019m very happy with my life despite the rigor of school. You learn to work efficiently and get at it every day-my day starts at 6 am to hit the gym before school. The number 1 rule is that discipline = freedom.\n\nPick that up and you\u2019ll thrive.",

            "comment": "I agree with what has been said. The pace is much faster and there is a greater volume of information. That for me is the challenge, not the difficulty of the material. BYU was actually fantastic preparation. Anatomy, physiology and biochem both were a huge boost for med school.",

            "comment": "Haven\u2019t had experience being pregnant while on the insurance, but I do work at BYU\u2019s health insurance office. I\u2019m not sure why, but the Health Center doesn\u2019t actually do any maternity care, so you\u2019d have to find a doctor in the area that you like (and that\u2019s in network with the insurance) and then you\u2019ll be paying $25 co-pays and 20% of the visit charges for any maternity care you need. From there, when actually at the hospital for the birth, you\u2019ll have a $300 co-pay and 20% of the charges. After that, you could enroll your baby as a dependent on your plan and will similarly pay a $100 co-pay and 20% of any of the care they need to receive after the birth. Lastly, you can then bring that baby to the health center for any other care they need and pay the regular $10 co-pay and 0% of the visit charge because the health center does do pediatrics. That\u2019s like a super basic explanation, but that\u2019s the main stuff. So\u2026 in my opinion\u2026 it\u2019s okay coverage, but I wouldn\u2019t put my wife on the plan during a pregnancy. I\u2019d go with Medicaid.",

It's infinity cheaper to look into your parents insurance or Medicaid. For a college that pushes having children, their health insurance plan doesn't reflect it. \n\n(BYU health insurance also won't cover birth control)",

We considered byu insurance but for non-student spouses they have a $4000 pregnancy deductible! We made too much for Medicaid but we worked with an insurance broker (they\u2019re free) who set us up with subsidized insurance via the affordable care act (Obamacare). Insurance is $50 a month, low deductible, low max out of pocket which we hit pretty quickly so we\u2019re covered the rest of the year. \n\nTLDR: if you don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid, work with an insurance broker to view ACA rates before purchasing byu health insurance.",

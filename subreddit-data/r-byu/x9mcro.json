I know this is a very specific and likely hard-to-answer question, but I really just want to know where I can go to meet some people who haven\u2019t gone on missions. I don\u2019t have anything against RMs, it\u2019s just kinda hard to relate sometimes, especially when most of the people I meet now are 22+ and I\u2019m only 19. Plus, as much as I love the Cougs, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m comfortable dating that far above my age lol. Also, if anyone here is in the same boat please hmu! I\u2019d love to get in touch, and who knows maybe we can help each other out in this crappy situation.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m planning on starting my computer science major this fall, and would like to start with CS 111 since it\u2019s the intro course. I don\u2019t really want to have to take CS 110 this fall since that costs more time/money, and since  I don\u2019t have any programming experience, my current plan is to go through all the available lessons and coursework for 110 on my own (without an instructor) and hope that\u2019s enough to prepare me for 111. \n\nIs this plan fine? Will 111 be too much for me in this scenario? Just lookin for some advice.",

            "comment": "I believe the CS department has it set up that the 111 and 110 courses are at the same time, so students can drop down into 110 if they find 111 too difficult (before the add/drop deadline) without changing their schedule. I would recommend a python Udemy course over the summer to prepare and then you should be fine in 111 as long as you work hard and put in the effort",

            "comment": "Do CS 110 first. My roommate and I both need CS classes up to like CS 260. Neither have any programming experience, and I started 110 while he started 111. We are both equally smart/good at problem solving. By the end of the semester, he knew more coding than me. I, however, understood the deeper ideas behind the code, and how to problem solve from the ground up. \n\nCS 110 doesn't just teach you coding. It teaches you to think like a coder. My roommate has really struggled with the CS classes since, while I have been able to get great grades. Trust me, take CS 110 first. One more CS class will not make or break your degree, and you will be so grateful.",

            "comment": "As someone who\u2019s taken both, if you\u2019ve never taken any programming or had any experience, take the time and start with CS 110. Learning the basics and how to debug is going to help you greatly. While plenty of people do just take CS 111 and do fine, they typically don\u2019t have a great deal of experience with how programming works, which can come back to bite them when things get more complicated.",

            "comment": "CS111 can be pretty hard, especially if you have no previous experience. I\u2019d take 110 first and master the basics unless you think it\u2019ll really mess up your future plans. I took 110 and it helped a lot but now I feel like I\u2019m behind because the CS course path is pretty linear with prereqs and I already have most of my GEs taken care of so your worry about spending more time/money is valid. Overall I think I would\u2019ve been fine just taking 111 and spending more time with TAs. It\u2019s up to you, and you can always start with 111 and drop if it\u2019s too much. The first few weeks of 111 was a review of 110/python so you wouldn\u2019t get behind 110 by taking 111 first.\n\n* Also 111 is being completely redesigned starting this summer term so it may be significantly easier/harder than before.",

            "comment": "I think that is doable, however I do expect it'll be harder than you think to work on the coursework solo. Back when I was taking CS 142, I did a similar thing. I began basic C++ studying to be better prepared. And it worked in my case, but it was by no means easy. C++ is also arguably a more difficult language than python, so it could work out. Just gotta weigh your strengths weaknesses.",

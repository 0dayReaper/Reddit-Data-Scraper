They created their own bubble. If you want to play by their rules, you gotta meet requirements to allow you to be considered 'by approved housing.' And because the school is so anal about making sure you live in approved housing, students have little choice. For those participating in byu's disgusting bubble, they don\u2019t need to keep rent low because the students are at the mercy of the school. But at this point its more worth it to just live in non approved housing and pay the non-compliance fees. That's what I did and I love it. Byu's bubble doesn't effect the rest of the city or state's housing market. Its just a weird little housing market they created separate from the rest of the system. If anything its the opposite if monopolization. They broke off more than took control of everything.",

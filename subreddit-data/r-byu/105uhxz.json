            "comment": "I'm a cyber major and I've taken both classes, but I took them different semesters. I think it's possible. 235 wasn't too bad, but if you found yourself really behind in 142 it might be a little difficult. Hughes taught my 252 class and she did a pretty good job, but now someone else is teaching that class. It wasn't too difficult, but you will be working with C and lower level languages that you'll have to learn. They do a good job of actually teaching the languages though. Just make sure that if you don't take these classes concurrently that you can still graduate on time. I took some of those 200 level classes in the wrong time and now I'll be at BYU for an extra year \ud83d\ude43",

If your not working at all then it might be more doable, but working 20 hours and taking all those classes would be pretty difficult",

You can take CS 224 as a substitute for IT&amp;C 252 in the spring or summer term. You will just have to talk to the academic advisor afterwards to get it on your record as counting.",

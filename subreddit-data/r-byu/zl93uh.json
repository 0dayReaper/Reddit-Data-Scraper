            "comment": "I took Span 101 last year and while I don't know enough about your other classes to say if it will be doable I can tell you what the work load was like. I did it taking 12 credits (6 were engineering credits) and working almost ten hours a week. It definitely took up a large chunk of my time, but it worked for me that semester.\n\nWe had class 4 times a week + 1 language lab attendance making it 5 hours a week in the classroom. Attendance was required. There was also homework every day. I could usually rush through it in under 30 minutes but occasionally there would be a really long lesson. Learning the material properly made it take longer. There was an exam almost every other week that had both a written and an oral part. I found the exams to not be too bad but I did have to study a bit before each one.\nI had to attend two cultural activities but there was a large range of options to fulfill this. We also filmed a short film in a group project. I enjoyed these and didn't find them to take too much time.",

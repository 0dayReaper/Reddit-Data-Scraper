Unless you have some special filtration systems in the air conditioning, people sitting 1 to a table for extended periods of time aren\u2019t really affected in their odds of catching COVID by whether people doing the same around them are wearing a mask or not. Masks are good for quick encounters (less than 20 minutes) and close interactions.",

The governor has disallowed all social gatherings of any size. Not because you should be take the risk of you feel like it, but because we need to stop the spread of the virus even among students who don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal.",

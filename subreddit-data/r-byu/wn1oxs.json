    "postText": "Hey everyone! A friend of mine submitted his early application to BYU last December and was subsequently rejected earlier this year. He just received a legitimate email (we checked the email and confirmed her identity) from a member of the admissions team offering him admission to Fall 2022, the same semester he had applied for before. Does anyone know anything about this? Is it common? He just received it and the semester is starting in two weeks, so that is why we are wary. Thanks for your help.",

He had made other plans though, and declined. I think if fewer than the planned number of students accept the invitation to attend they can open those spots up again.",

When spots open up last minute, communications are done via direct email, as mail creates a delay in getting word out. This is a common practice, please do not ignore that email! I have heard of several spots at BYU opening up in the last week or so, so I expect this is very legit. Congrats to your friend, hope they decide to take advantage of it!",

    "postText": "Im thinking of withdrawing from an Econ class I\u2019m taking. I will still be above the minimum of 12 credits so I won\u2019t lose my scholarship. \n\nDoes anyone know how bad a W looks on a transcript? Will it be harder for me to get an academic scholarship next year, or is there no effect since it doesn\u2019t affect my GPA? \n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated",

I\u2019m sure one W is better than a D or an F at least. \n\nI withdrew from one class while I was at BYU, and to my knowledge it never negatively affected me. Not sure about applying for scholarships in the future though",

Never once has a W ever been a subject of discussion.\n\nThat being said, it may be that in some other programs a W might look bad. But the amount of work it takes for someone to notice how many Ws are on a transcript is absurd. If someone is counting Ws on your transcript you're already not solidly in the \"yes\" pile.",

If you\u2019re only going for a bachelors and are just worried about the scholarship, one or two W\u2019s on your transcript over 4 years should be okay.",

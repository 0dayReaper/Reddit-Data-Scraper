            "comment": "WRTG150 is a breeze as long as you take it from the right professor. The same goes for the HUM classes for filling your civ credits\u2014most of them are taught by English faculty and if you take from the right one (use rate my professor) it\u2019s gonna be just fine. They\u2019re typically just surveys of literature and art. Lots of fun and fairly low commitment. I would get American Heritage out of the way sooner than later if you have to take it. It\u2019s a bit tougher but still not too hard compared to some of the major core classes you\u2019ll take. \n\nIf you\u2019re not a STEM major and need the physical science credit, the geology classes (planets or gemstones taught by Ross) are fun and not hard at all.\n\nWorld Religions (RELC351 I think) is an awesome class that takes care of a religion elective and your global GE. I honestly think it should be required but that\u2019s just me.",

It\u2019s a period known as second-temple Judaism. The Israelites decided never to give God a reason to punish them ever again. They figured the best way to do this was to build a wall around Jerusalem to keep the rest of the world out And kick out all who weren\u2019t completely Jewish. It\u2019s also when they became very Pharisaical and enforced lots of strict rules with little doctrinal backing. \n\nAnd of course, surprise surprise, when Jesus comes around he condemns their attitudes and behaviors towards others and all the little rules they came up with. Their response? To get mad at Jesus and accuse him of heresy.",

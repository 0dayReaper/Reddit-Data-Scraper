I'd like her to concentrate on having a good experience, getting a good GPA, and not being freaked out about choosing a future too early. What classes would you recommend that are good/fun/ useful or whatever you'd consider a great way to get started the first semester?",

American Heritage, Freshman English, Physical Science are all classes that are notoriously filled with Freshmen. If she has any inkling of what she *might* want to do, I\u2019d start taking some intro classes in those fields as well just to get a feel for it.",

            "comment": "SFL 260 - Family Finance. This taught me so much useful info about being an adult, and it wasn't a hard class either. \n\nWorld Religions with Greg Wilkinson is probably the easiest religion class I ever took, but good luck getting a spot. It is also one of the most popular, and the waitlist is already long I bet. \n\nCS 110 - How to Code. This one is not an \"easy\" class per se, but will likely be applicable in any career. Even if you aren't going into tech or stem, you can still use the stuff you learn to automate parts of your job. \n\nIT&amp;C 101. If you know anything about computers or even want to learn about them, this is a great class. It's basically impossible to not get an A as long as you actually try. The TAs make sure of that. You get to learn about how and why computers work, how devices talk to each other, how information is kept safe online, and you even get a taste of \"hacking\". Maybe I'm biased because I'm in the program, but the Cybersecurity program has the single best community. There is zero drama, and everyone legitimately wants to help others do better. \n\nBasically any STDEV class will be set up to be hard to fail. They are also all important things to learn like leadership, public speaking, and how to study. \n\nMusic 201 (I think this is it) is also very easy, and impossible to fail as long as you show up.",

This is for several reasons:\n\n1. If you hate the class, great! You've just eliminated one potential major from your list!\n2. If you like the class, great! You're one class closer to finishing your major than you would have been otherwise.\n3. If you don't do this, are you suddenly going to know what you want to major in next year? Maybe some GE classes will help, but maybe not. Switching majors is perfectly fine. I did it twice, and boy was that second major of mine a bad idea! (But I didn't know that until my 3rd semester.)\n4. Taking some random GE course your senior year while bogged down in your quantum chemistry classes (or whatever) is amazing! But you can't do that if you packed them all into your first 3 semesters.\n\nYou don't have to go 100% all-in on a prospective major. Maybe you have several competing ideas. That's find. You can take that first civil engineering class one semester, and the first German history class another semester and start figuring things out.",

Even if the student doesn't find a major or goal after taking it, a lot of the class is just geared towards getting to understand yourself better which is helpful in all aspects of life. Hot take tho: wait until the second semester to do it. Everybody I know grew and changed a lot in their first semester away from home. Doing all this introspective self-discovery is more helpful *after* becoming a bit more independent.\n\nLike other people have said, take intro classes that seem interesting and can fill GEs. I think I took 7 different intro-level classes before I chose my major",

Also depending on the major some are very long ( like engineering/ education where you have zero electives and no space for a minor) or limited enrollment majors require you take certain classes and apply before you get into the actual major. So you are better to not go in totally aimless- I recommend picking something and changing if you want something else later or starting down two paths. Just taking ge classes will generally not help you get any closer to a major. The just do your ges now and pick a major later does not work as well at byu especially because religion requirement (which is about equal to a minor) takes up the space most people have in college to explore.",

    "postText": "This supreme court ruling could impact BYU clubs and the campus as a whole. Yeshiva University, also called the Y by the Orthodox Jewish Community, has many parallels to BYU. A highly religious school catering to a religious community which also forbids Same-sex marriage and intimacy. While the Yeshiva charter is different than BYUs, being chartered as a  non-religious organization, the opinion also suggests that Yeshiva University offers \"too many secular degrees to qualify for religious exemptions.\"  \n\n\nWith the ruling coming down Yeshiva chose to suspend all their club activities rather than recognize the LGBTQ+ clubs.   \n\n\nCould the same thing happen at BYU? Would BYU suspend it's clubs rather than offer a place at the table for an LGBTQ+ Club? They've already denied the formation of a club a few times? What do you think? \n\n[https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-supreme-court-decision-says-yeshiva-university-must-recognize-lgbtq-club/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-supreme-court-decision-says-yeshiva-university-must-recognize-lgbtq-club/)",

            "comment": "Its only a temporary suspension on clubs.The Supreme Court only ruled that Yeshiva had not exhausted its legal options in New York and they they wouldn't hear the case. Yeshiva will appeal in NY and the inital decision will likely be reversed. If it's not Justice Alito stated Yeshiva would likely prevail on its claim in the Supreme Court. So in the long run nothing will happen at BYU.",

But so many are afraid to come out or think they are sinful simply because they are attracted to the same sex. Across vastly different societies all over the world, homosexuality is consistently found in at around 2% of the human population (if not more, and this isn\u2019t even including bisexuality).\nSo why are we still discriminating against a natural biological feature? A rough estimate is that 140 million people in the world are gay. It\u2019s no different than having a different hair color. So why are we constantly demonized?",

It causes one to fear it as oppression when they have been enjoying privilege all this time. It exposes ones' own personal insecurities and it is easier to deflect that blame onto an external thing as the reason for those insecurities. The fear could be that gay men existing would result in less number of children being born and thus demise of the civilization. That fear obviously doesn't address the infertility in heterosexual couples or common issues like infidelity, broken homes etc which existed for a long time. I digress. \n\nBut it just comes down to fear or unknown and the concepts of tribal nature of wanting to belong to a homogenous group and not stand out as different.",

The Mormon church actively pushes out gay members, so many gay members leave the church at much higher rates than straight members. So the ones who are left are not representative of the ones who had many mental health issues because of the church.\n2. Many Mormons who are gay, don\u2019t actually identify as gay, so they wouldn\u2019t be included in those statistics. If they never came out to anyone and committed suicide, then those statistics wouldn\u2019t catch that\n\nI encourage you to actually empathize with people within your own community, rather than sweeping their problems under the rug and pretending like nothing is wrong",

Can the the State of New York force Yeshiva to recognize clubs that contradict to their principles? If so, why not a Nazi Club or a Auschwitz appreciation club?\n\nNote: for those that will assume I'm comparing the LGBT club to Nazis, please read carefully and understand its merely an illustration to drive home the principle. \n\nI'm just trying to explain the legal matters to the best of my ability.

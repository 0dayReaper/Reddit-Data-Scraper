There were some members who reacted awfully and in a bigoted manner during the Prop 8 conflicts in 2008, but it's unfair to paint every member of the church as anti-LGBTQ+ because of that when a lot of us, especially millennials and zoomers, are really supportive. Again, bigotry tries to reduce a diverse set of people to a monolith. I hate that I have to disclaimer that I support LGBTQ+ issues and believe trans rights are human rights just because I'm an active member.\n\nI don't think you're a bigot based on this interaction, but there are certainly bigots on /r/exmormon, and it's a coin toss if they get called out for their hate speech or not. You can ask me to try and make my community better, but I can ask the same of you.\n\nWe can definitely support one another in this cause but just remember that your community contains individuals who attempted hate crimes just a few months ago and are still actively posting and getting lots of support and upvotes. Lots of people with anti-LDS agendas have historically co-opted grassroots Mormon movements like this, in bad faith, to create contention among members, and make people doubt the institution that underpins their entire belief system.

That said, having both a father and a mother is probably ideal, in the same way growing up with financial security and being neurotypical is ideal. Like, we do the best with what we have because the world isn't perfect.\n\nA lot of this is generational. Baby Boomers and older are mostly pretty uncaring about LGBT issues. But millennials are good, and zoomers are both more aware of diversity and more religious than we are. So here's fingers crossed for change.\n\nI hope things get better for you with your mother. I can understand your anger towards the church if her beliefs are driving you apart. But the doctrine of the church calls on her to show you unconditional love and understanding, not shame or judgment or guilt-tripping or whatever.

Ex Mormons don't hate Mormons. We just don't. Mormons the people are our friends, families, and loved ones. Ex Mormons do however quite often have a hatred for the institution itself. It may sound like semantics but it's a vitally important distinction. \n\nTo quote someone much smarter than myself, 'if you can love the sinner but hate the sin, I can love the believer but hate the belief'.\n\nIm glad you consider yourself progressive, my suspicion is that over the coming decades as a new generation fill the hierarchy, the church as an institution will move to mirror this. But I would ask you, do you still rationalise that a life alone, without love or companionship, is just part of god's plan for LGBT members, and something to be rewarded in the next life. Or do you, like me, view such a requirement as something no loving god would ask of anyone.\n\nWith love,\n\nAn ex-Mormon",

You really need to pay a bit more attention before labeling something you don\u2019t understand.  I at first thought you were a troll but in reading your comments you sort of switch between someone who seems open minded and genuine to someone who makes ridiculously over exaggerated statements about people he has no clue about.   Most ex Mormons spend 5-10 years morning the loss of their faith and their community.  Many of them leave because of the kinds of things the protestors of the honor code are talking about.  Have a little empathy man, most everyone in that community has it for you.",

That contract being, in exchange for paying tuition and living by certain standards, you receive a highly-subsidized high-quality education.

More expensive than an ivy league school if you know your math. Say you make 70k from ages 30 to 60. That's a minimum of 7k a year in tithing. 7\u00d730 years = $210,000. Most expensive schooling of your life. And they are mirroring Satans plan while doing it.",

What you have here basically says if you choose to be strongly influenced with school status and belonging to a group to make all the right choices, then it is basically as if you chose to make all the right choices so...it is the same really.\n\nBut I do not agree! The person must be allowed to make all choices ENTIRELY on their own for it to fit the definition of agency. Redefine definitions all you want. The honor code is a watered down version of Satans plan. It has to go.\n\n ...How did spirits so interested in making people live a certain way like this get a body and not end up just a spirit with Satan is my question. You guys know this is wrong.",

Agency doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re free from consequences.\n\nThe HC is a set of rules and if you\u2019re caught breaking what\u2019s considered a severe rule (premarital sex for example) you\u2019ll likely be told to leave the school for a certain period of time before you can return. They don\u2019t force anyone to do anything. They can\u2019t stop someone from having sex if they want to have sex for example, but they can say if you\u2019re going to do that you can\u2019t attend this school. What agency is lost? We believe it\u2019s ok for the bishop to tell us we can\u2019t take the sacrament for a time after \u201cbreaking the rules\u201d so clearly the concept is not counter to the gospel. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t problems with the HC (I wasn\u2019t a big fan of parts of it myself when i attended) but saying that it removes agency is just silly.",

[Average Ivy League Tuition and fees are $54k per year](https://www.collegetuitioncompare.com/best-schools/Ivy-League/). Granted, they assess the amount you have to pay based on need, so many BYU students wouldn't pay the full amount, but most of them can't get into an Ivy anyway. \n\nSo using \"simply math\", you see that even if you finished in 4 years flat, your total cost would be $216k. This also isn't taking into account that most Ivy League schools list their room and board in the $14k-16k per year range, as opposed to BYU's listed amount of around $7500.\n\nThis also doesn't account for the fact that you get those next 30 years of working for the value of $7k per year to be much less and a smaller portion of your income. Also, rather than paying interest on that $200k+ through loan interest, you instead get to earn money as you are only paying tithing based on money earned. Think of it as an interest free loan.\n\nFinally, before you are done with that 30 year career, you have already started sending your own children to BYU and are benefiting from a world class education for the cost of a very cheap state school.\n\nSo please, again tell me how you think that BYU is not highly subsidized.",

BUT most dont just pay 10% after you factor in fast offering it is going to look more like 15%. Your pay, grandparents pay, kids pay, not all even get an education there.\n\nThat's the cash. Then you consider the time. 2 year mission of free labor that most times the person/their family pays for.\n 2 hours every week for church. Two hours minimum for Wednesday night activities, (4 hrs weekly) 1 hour early morning seminary for self and then driving the kids (5 hours weekly) so 9 hrs/week. 52 weeks a year*9 =468hrs/24hrs= 19.5 days a year of free labor not including temple service. It is A LOT and ends up being more expensive due to those not so appearent expenses.\n\nI still maintain after all funds donated, time donated you pay way more as a lifelong  practicing mormon going to BYU or a child going to BYU vs an IVY league school or just a regular community college like most people do anyhow.\n\nBYU is extremely expensive.",

Are you going to count prep school and tutoring and all the other ancillary costs people do to get their kids into an Ivy. \n\nBYU is subsidized. Full stop. When you give tithing, time, or other monies, completely voluntarily I might add, you give up any say in how the Lord decides to utilize that money or time. The Church chooses to use that to subsidize a BYU education. It is by definition subsidizing: they take money from one source and make it cheaper to attend BYU. \n\nYou can lawyer your way around it all you want, but there isn\u2019t some special accounting going on for lifelong members and generational members where you are accruing credit towards attending BYU.",

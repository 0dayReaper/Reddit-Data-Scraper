    "postText": "I'm currently looking for a new laptop to replace my old one before starting the IS junior core this fall. I'm wondering if past or current IS students (or anyone familiar with computers) has any recommendations on models, hardware requirements, etc., and what I need to keep up with the demands that'll be put on my machine.\n\nEdit: Title is supposed to say \"Info Sys\". Autocorrect got me again.",

            "comment": "You'll probably want a PC. A few of your classes will involve programming (it looks like the core programming class [IS 403](http://catalog.byu.edu/business/information-systems/principles-of-business-programming) now teaches C#, which is kinda surprising, but probably not a bad way to learn OO programming), and IDEs can be pretty resource intensive, so you'd probably want a minimum 16GB of memory.\n\nAnd you may do virtualization in some of your classes (or want to tinker in a Linux VM), so the extra memory will help there too. Make sure the chipset on your computer supports virtualization (I'd assume it's universal now, but a friend of mine in IS got a good deal on what seemed like a powerful laptop, but then found out the processor didn't support virtualization).\n\nI can run some dev Linux VMs on my 8GB MS Surface, but 16GB would be much better.",

                    "comment": "Some additional thoughts about PC vs Mac:\n\nWhen I was in IS, the MS/Windows environment was taught heavily. Our enterprise classes focused on Windows Server, Windows Active  Directory, and even included administration in Powershell. The reasoning was that many major enterprises run their architecture on Windows domain controllers.\n\nI'm not sure if things are still taught that way (one of the MS evangelists in the IS department is no longer at BYU), but the fact that IS 403 is now C# would seem to indicate they still lean heavily on MS.\n\nAdditionally, you can pretty easily run Linux dev VMs on a Windows machine if you want to get into non-MS technology. But I'm not sure it's worth the Mac premium to try to port over all the MS functionality onto a Mac.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I know that technical people love non-MS technologies, but from a practical standpoint, I think it's defensible that the IS program teaches so much MS technology.",

I just finished the core - I made it through just fine with 8gb ram, 128gb storage. 16gb ram would have been nice, especially second semester.\n\nAt least half of my cohort was on mac, and they adapted the curriculum several times to accommodate. \n\nI had a MS surface, but would have gotten a macbook were I going through the core again.",

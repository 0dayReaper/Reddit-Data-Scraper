    "postText": "Good day!\n\nI have been recently admitted to BYU and am excited to meet the people of Provo in person very soon and feel that blessed environment.\n\nBut! I have never been not only in Utah but in the US. And after reading the top posts of this subreddit I started to realize, that I was somewhat delusional about the idealistic life of a BYU student. Here is what I realized after reading those posts:\n\n1. The first concern is the house renting problem. While I will live in campus dorms for the 1st freshman year, then I am planning to rent an apartment in town. And many students complain about scum culture among landlords, which dream is to completely rip you off for the last cent. Is it so terrible to rent a flat outside of the BYU campus?\n2. Not everyone strictly follows the honor code. Some can drink alcohol, smoke, and have premarital sex and get away with that. I would be happy to live in a society, which is free of those flaws, but as I see it - there is no heaven on Earth, people are people everywhere with their weaknesses. Provo and BYU is no exception. Is it just rare cases and most of the students follow the code?\n3. I have no evidence, just rumors, that some students of other religions or Christianity denominations are forced to be converted into LDS church members. I am from Russia, I follow my Orthodox Christian Church and wish to stay there. How my educational and day-to-day life experience would differ from the people of LDS? Could I feel somehow lonely and isolated from everyone's joy and activities?\n4. Would I feel like an old grumpy man among youngsters? I am 35 and afraid of being like a \"white crow\" at the university.\n5. Can I easily find an on-campus job, that paid enough to cover my tuition and living costs?  \nI have a programming background with full-time job experience if it matters.\n6. What should I do from the 1st day I arrive at BYU to accommodate and integrate into society faster as an international student?\n\nps. Any other advice or stereotype breaks about studying at BYU are welcome.",

Most people follow the honor code. It is really hard to find someone violating it and then brag about it.\n3. Muslim here, they approached me to convert and gave me the book of mormon, but I am still Muslim so it is up to you.\n4. My classmate is 50. Idk about the dorm situation as it may look weird.\n5. On campus will definitely not be enough to pay for all of your expenses. You wanna aim at getting a scholarship.\n6. Just be friendly to everyone and hit the university club. You can also go to the office of belonging where they host lots of events and have lots of international students and non-members",

People aren't racist or anything negative, they are all super nice.\n\nI got a campus job fairly easily. It might cover rent and food but not tuition until maybe the spring and summer when you can earn more.\n\nHousing is easy if you just find the right fb group pages. A shared one is like 400 to 500 with privates being abit more expensive. Idk if you have to live in the dorms if you're above 25\n\nSome people aren't members and although I have yet to met ones that do the extreme stuff I really don't care honestly. Some of my friends don't really follow the honor code and honestly as long as they don't force me to do it I really don't care \n\nMissionaries will be around the wilk and will try to talk to you and will try to learn more about the church but honestly if you straight up just say hey I have my own religion and I'm happy with it they will let you do. No one will actively try to convert you\n\nMeeting people from the same country helps but then again I don't actively go searching for my fellowmen and I'm still fine , happy and thriving",

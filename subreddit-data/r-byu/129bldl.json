I graduated high school with a 3.8 GPA and currently have a 3.0 GPA for my first year of college (I didn\u2019t do so great my first semester).",

            "comment": "I'll share my experience as a former transfer student myself. Tl;dr I'd recommend finishing an associates before transferring. \n\nMy high school GPA was only like 3.3 unweighted so I didn't even apply to BYU for my freshman year. I did a year at Snow College and had a 2.9. Came back from my mission and kicked it into high gear, got my associates and advanced institute diploma, and got accepted to BYU with a 3.7. \n\nThe associates made it so I could skip all the general ed requirements. The institute diploma made it so I only had to take 1 religion class of my choosing (D&amp;C 2 with Dr Dorius, RIP). But even then, I got nickeled and dimed by my department about which classes would transfer. For example, I was told I would need to retake linear algebra... as I was working as a tutor for linear algebra in the math lab. I was able to test out of it.\n\nMy recommendation to everyone that's trying to transfer that will listen is to get an associates first because, if you don't, you will likely retake a number of general classes. Plus, that gives you some time to hopefully get your GPA up. And, if possible, try to communicate with each school's departments for your major to figure out which credits will transfer and prioritize the ones that will. \n\nI know that unfortunately means you have to live in Reno longer (I'm originally from Vegas and had to get my dig in somewhere). But I think that will make the transfer go more smoothly.",

I also went to Snow first- and initially when my records were transferred it was without my degree posted (but still all the classes I had taken). I would\u2019ve had to take American heritage, Econ, biology, and a few others again. Once my degree was transferred I had a lot more freedom of classes to take.",

Came home.\n\nRejection #2.\n\n36 credits at UVU w/ 4.0 GPA. (3 semesters)\n\nAccepted.\n\nI honestly have no idea what goes into the admission decision. I personally believe it's easier if you're not from Utah (I'm from SLC and it took 3 times with okay-ish credentials). People have worse credentials than I did and have gotten accepted, and I know some have better credentials and get rejected. You really won't know for sure until you apply. Extracurriculars help too.\n\nI'll say this, I would recommend being very careful about what credits BYU does and does not accept from your current school. UVU costed about the same, but my transfer to BYU set me back about a year because BYU is just picky about transfer credits and didn't accept a ton of classes I took at UVU. Stupid. But, I really wanted to go, so I made the transfer. \n\nI got my associates at UVU and repeatedly asked advisors if I needed to take generals or not and after asking maybe 4 different people I got a different answer every single time. So I'm not really sure if an associates really helps that much.\n\nBest",

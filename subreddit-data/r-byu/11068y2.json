    "postText": "For my assignment, I\u2019m writing about a football player who was arrested and charged with a DUI of both alcohol and a controlled substance. When trying to gather information, all it is about is his football career and that he\u2019s a prospect for the NFL etc. There wasn\u2019t anything noted by BYU or the team, and to my understanding the coach only benched him for a few games. \n\nMy question is are athletes exempt from following the honor code? Does it only apply to athletes that identify as LDS? How come the honor code office comes down hard on some students but seems to turn a blind eye to other students for the same infraction(s)?",

Given I think the dress and grooming standards are stupid, but it\u2019s wild that we can\u2019t play intramural sports with 5 o clock shadow when athletes represent the university on a national scale with non compliant hairstyles. So at least in that regard it\u2019s pretty obvious there\u2019s a double standard",

When they confronted him, the coach came into the office to talk to the supervisors and came to an agreement that the athlete wouldn\u2019t get into any trouble.\n\nAlso, I was friends with girls on the basketball team, and I knew one of the football players. The student athletes get a special resource class where they\u2019re supposed to sit, do their homework, and be tutored if they needed help. My friends told me that no one actually did any work; they all just hung out. \n\nSo yeah, the student athletes get a lot of perks.",

It seems like a strange report to write and frankly I would abandon the topic as there is no scholarship or legitimate research to build upon. In short, all BYU students are held to the honor code. Top-level college athletes, who are often not really at the school for education and who are functionally professional athletes come from a more diverse group than the general student body, and one which is disproportionately non-LDS and less likely to follow all aspects of the honor code, especially some of the finer points (to put it nicely to the outdated honor code) like dress and grooming, etc. However, when they do get in serious trouble, there punishments can frankly be worse than other students as they face public humiliation not just in local but even national media. Being public figures can even get them caught in the first place. Practically everything you read beyond that is going to be decades of bias-fueled hearsay that I can\u2019t imagine would make for a decent academic paper.",

I'm not interested in criminal law really, or in being a trail attorney, I just want to learn more about law and what it would be like to practice law. I realize those are two different things, but the more information I can get the better.",

If you\u2019re seriously considering it as a career, it would be a good idea to \u201cshadow\u201d as many different types of lawyers as you can.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in prepping for the LSAT and still have some time left, I\u2019d recommend taking courses in philosophy (especially logic), math, and higher-level literature. Math and philosophy majors consistently do better on the LSAT than other majors that you\u2019d think would be good preparation like Political Science and Pre-Law.",

Join a volunteer organization or get involved in the community. You said you had a passion for sports and hospitality\u2014that\u2019s great! But try to show and not tell. What have you done that demonstrates that? Find ways to fulfill your passions.\n\nAlso no, it\u2019s not a guarantee admittance for transfer students. Spring/summer 2023 transfer applicants had a 60.2% acceptance rate. You can find that and other statistics for transfer students [here](https://enrollment.byu.edu/admissions/entrance-stats)",

Byu is the better and more rigorous school but byui is probably more fun (according to my brothers and a few friends that attended both). I know people who graduated from both who went on to do awesome things including med and other professional schools. Many graduate programs think byui is just an extensions of byu.",

Many majors are limited enrollment too at BYU means you can can't just major in what you want and because it isn't built on an \"associates\" system. Many require you start taking major classes early on. I would say you may be just as well time wise to finish there and go to BYU for grad school. Sometimes I see students lose a lot of time in a transfer and wind up only with a bachelors when spending that time toward a masters would have much greater career impact.\n\nAlso there are a lot of (6 or 7) essays on transfer app (and BYU app in general) those are really important factor in getting in.",

    "postText": "I am a recent BYU alumni. I come from a family of die-hard BYU fans and mostly active members of the church. I, myself, am in the middle of a faith transition and as a result, am diving deeper than ever into the history, good and bad, of the church and BYU. I recently came across this information that shocked and appalled me. \n\nBYU approved and allowed a study in 1976 that essentially gave gay students an ultimatum: either be kicked out of school and face church and familial punishment for being gay, or participate in this \u201ctherapy\u201d.\n\nNot only did it traumatize most of the 14 men who went through it, but 2 of them ended up dying by suicide later and others seriously contemplated suicide.\n\nThough this doesn\u2019t make it okay at all, I understand that at the time, there were other \u201cstudies\u201d and \u201cgay aversion therapy\u201d practices going on at other universities, yet why would BYU, a school lead, ultimately, by a prophet of God, be a part of such a disgusting thing? \n\nIt makes me so angry that BYU, which should be a school associated with the spirit of love and kindness of Christ, not only allowed this to happen but continues to actively discriminate and tolerate hateful behavior towards LGBTQ students.\n\nNote, as I was researching this, I learned that Dallin Oaks, who was the president of BYU at the time, was asked about this last year during a Q&amp;A at another university but denied that this happened, which is clearly a lie. Why would an apostle blatantly lie?\n\nI\u2019m not looking for excuses about why this might have been accepted at the time or any \u201chate the sin\u201d garbage. I just want other students to know that this happened because I never did and I want to know why it\u2019s not acknowledged, and even lied about?\n\n[https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Health/mormon-gay-cures-reparative-therapies-shock-today/story?id=13240700](https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Health/mormon-gay-cures-reparative-therapies-shock-today/story?id=13240700)",

A couple of months ago I went through the same process of \u201cawakening.\u201d \n\nYou just realize that things aren\u2019t as you thought they were. Anyway, I\u2019m glad that with the help of my wife and much effort to reconcile my testimony with everything I was discovering about church history, I decided to stay in the church, and now I feel that my testimony grew to be even stronger than before.\n\nThe whole situation of President Oaks saying that those \u201crecovery gay therapy\u201d didn't happen when he was president of BYU is so messed up. He straight lied or just got the dates very, very confused. That's just another reminder that prophets and apostles are men subject to bias and weaknesses like we all are. \n\nNow, I wouldn't say that BYU and the church are hiding this information because if you go to lib.byu.edu you can find all the studies from 1976 explaining the experiments and things they tried. So... Yeah... Super weird and messed up. I agree with you on asking why would the lord allowed these horrendous things to happen in his university.  Whether we like it or not, society has a huge influence on the church, because the church is being guided by mortal people like you and me that live in this world and adopt worldly costumes and practices. And back then, everyone was experimenting with gays :/\n\nOnce we learn from this and many other things that happened in church history, it\u2019s normal to feel betrayed and automatically lose trust in the church and its leaders. However, I think we tend to emotionally react to these findings and we make important decisions thinking emotionally. Once we chill out a little bit and sit with that discomfort, we start thinking more rationally. In my case, I came to understand that BYU and the Church won't ever cry out from the roof of the buildings about all the things they did badly. No one does that. Along with that, I appreciated that BYU still has public records of all the studies and experiments with gay students. They could have perfectly deleted everything but they didn't. \n\nComparing BYU and the church now with what they were back then, we can see massive improvement. \nI have faith that we, as a community centered in Christ, will keep making improvements until the day Jesus comes back. Until then, we will all have to try to keep pushing forward with a bitter-sweet taste in our hearts...",

One - the information is available because it was an actual published study. BYU couldn't get rid of it if they tried. Two - \"everyone\" was not experimenting with gay people. Other colleges and universities were not shocking the genitals of their LGBT students. And this study was not comprised entirely of voluntary participants. If you got discovered or ratted out, it was this or expulsion. Three - the men whose genitals were shocked Clockwork Orange style do not have the option of just moving on and hoping for progress. It took my uncle many years to seek therapy and many more years to even begin to recover. Some others never made it that far. For an organization that is big on atonement, an acknowledgement and apology would go a long way to healing. Or maybe even just not blatantly lying about it in public by a man that is supposed to be god's representative on earth. None of this feels centered in Christ.",

I believe the report released by the PhD. He did it to undo the speculation, guessing and, \"I know a guy who said,\" that was out there. \n\nSpeculation, postulation, \"my uncle said.\"\n\nThe research is there. The PdD has released the information. There are myths, misunderstandings, and false information out there about this. \n\nThe truth is that critics of the Church and those with disdain have made what happen more than what happened.\n\nThe professor has released his information. The volunteer participants had sensors attached to their private areas. They were not shocked there.\n\n\"Aversion therapy\" was thought to be a tool to cure everything back then. \"Aversion therapy\" is still used as a \"cure\" to over-eating and smoking and such. Less was known about being gay back in the day. Some people honestly thought it could be \"cured.\" It can't gay folks are \"born that way.\"\n\nAccording to the study, the PhD allowed the volunteer subjects of the study to choose the location of the shocks, and it was arms, legs and such.\n\nThe BYU President, Oaks, would not have known about the study.\n\nThe study would not have worked if the subjects were not volunteers trying to \"cure\" their problems. Someone forced into the study would not have worked, and the documents show the adult volunteers signed disclaimers.\n\nThere is a lot of speculation, postulation, and \"my uncles said\" out there that does not match the actual documents and evidence and materials from the study.",

The Psychgologist \"DSM\" reference manual called being gay a disorder until 1973. \n\n&gt;And that Oaks, still to this day, has no idea that it happened such that he can deny it's existence in public? \n\nIt was a pretty small study. Other Universities did it if you Google it. Nothing scientifically groundbreaking came from it.  You can't change being gay. \n\nOaks --as University President-- of a pretty good sized University would not have known about it at the time. \n\nMost people don't know about it. They study was not known or studied outside of the BYU Department. \n\nI can't remember the first time I heard about it. But I have known about it for a while, but I am interested in this sort of thing. The University President? The PhD did not go through the top-office for this study. And the results were not published outside his own research paper at the time.\n\n&gt;Sorry, but I'll continue to believe my blood over an organization that exists to create apologetics for the LDS church.\n\nThe study and research is there.

[Link](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Aversion-Version-1.40.pdf)\n\nThere are several explanations. It is natural that people remember things differently. That is why it is so important to go back to the actual work and see exactly what occurred. Exactly what happened. You might not like that the PhDs own words and research contradict what you know. And you might not like the webpage that has his honest and accurate words and writings.

Now, what about FAIR and BYU? Seems to me they stand to gain much more by altering the truth.\n\nThe research itself that I linked-to has the answers you and I are both looking for. \n\nYour uncle --if he participated in the sole solitary peer-reviewed study at BYU-- would not have been shocked in his private area. He would have been shocked in his arms or legs. Back when the DSM labeled being gay a \"disorder.\" He would have voluntarily participated. And he would have acknowledged that the study was not tied to BYU.\n\nWe can read all that in the research.\n\nThe truth has not been altered. The study is there for all of us to see and read.",

The connotation of your words were:  \"you must be crazy to call my words gas lighting, so you must be desparate (and therefore untrustworthy/crazy)\".\n\nI don't think you're crazy.

Transparency is a great value, and I hope Church culture adopts it even more in the future, but that would be an extreme application of it!\n\nWhen I attended BYU as a Psychology student, I heard of conversion therapy at BYU happening in the past.

He bore strong testimony of the Church using his History credentials... [Link](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1977/08/brigham-young-man-of-the-spirit?lang=eng) He had an internal struggle that few of people understand and a Church (which he clearly loved to a point in his timeline) which did not understand or accept. I theorize he could have found more acceptance in todays climate.\n\nBut Quinn clearly departed from faithfulness after a point, positioned himself as the go-to Historian concerning the Church for those seeking information, openly advocated against those seeking information from faithful historians. Something a fair and honest historian would never do.\n\nPlamer? Palmer openly claims he lost his testimony of the restoration while still working for the Church. Palmers published work was -highly- critical of the Church, mostly regurgitated common anti-Latter Day Saint talking points and he was not excommunicated. Even though he claimed to be an \"insider\" spilling the beans... a laughable claim. Palmer eventually left the Church on his own decision and accord.\n\nThe Church has every right to be asked to be called by its name and not its nickname. Going-back it has tried to put its formal name out there more. Even the, \"I am a Mormon\" cards had the formal name in prominent locations. The links led to websites where the formal name was prominent. It was a marketing tool geared towards more traffic for the Church. The emphasis when I was in the MTC and when I was on my mission was to use the formal name of the Church as often as I could. Even during the \"I am a Mormon\" campaign, the \"usage guide\" from the Church was for media organizations and authors to use the full name of the Church in formal writing. I don't see an issue or problem with the Church asking folks to use the formal name.",

Thanks for sharing that data point.\n\nWe could make an argument they and their social sciences cousins are the ones who need to know about this most, I guess.\n\nBut I think that given the amount of time that the church puts into this issue specifically including challenging the legitimacy of queer relationships and insisting that only straight relationships are going to be enough for exaltation... it's still essentially implying changed orientation will be necessary at some point for queer people. \n\nWhether the church sticks with this as doctrine or eventually treats the topic differently,  I would expect university-level religious discourse on that topic to include an acknowledgement of what has been tried, what did and did not work, and what queer people can stake their faith and choices on when it comes to any anticipated orientation change. Because if it's something everyone who's part of the faith is expected to sign onto, the church's university can at least educate everyone about this topic somewhere in those 14 hours of required religion credits.",

They've publicly avowed it's happened and have since moved on. Yes, it was a terrible practice and experiment, and as such those involved ought to be held accountable. However, I don't believe accountability looks like a continual publicly humiliating education of past wrongdoing. I can't think of a single organization on Earth that hands out a disclaimer listing all of its historical follies and all of its past mistakes and misteps for purposes of transparency. What benefit is there to doing that?\n\nMore, BYU has made serious steps in the right direction with this issue and is constantly trying to ensure LGBTQ people feel they belong within the bounds that Church doctrine and Church policy dictate. Yes, BYU has an unfortunate past, but continially publicly waiving that past around helps no  one and only engenders anger.\n\nBear in mind time and place: what happened happened half a century ago. Most of the people that were involved in that are either not alive or well into retirement. We have two successive generations in between then and now, two generations of social improvement towards tolerance and love. I'm not condoning their actions, but I do believe that the best way forward is to not dwell in the past but to look to the future, as corny as it sounds. Learn from the past, but then go forward.",

If you did it's be easy to provide it when I asked, or even before I asked and let the strength of your case speak for itself. It's also a signal that you don't know how big the field is, and how easy it is even for people who DO have some knowledge to miss research going on somewhere else. \n\nAnd then we get to the link. Oh, man your link. Delivered with such *posture*... when you don't even know how to distinguish electroconvulsive therapy from aversion therapy. \ud83e\udd23  Hell, I'll bet you still don't know why that matters, and are googling and realizing the relevance of the difference to your shamed chagrin as we speak (though of course angry and scheming about how you're going to get out of having your number *called*). \n\nYou can't respond to my position because the degree of required resolution here isn't something you've done enough work to achieve. Hell, might be that you can't clearly define *your* position. Go ahead. Make a statement about it. I'll wait. \n\nAnd then your rhetorical flourish -- you *pretend* that *I'm* the one who hasn't done any research, and you can't pick up from the cues you didn't engage with in my earlier comment that yes, I actually know some things about the field. \n\nYou wanna come clean and learn something?

            "comment": "I think part of the issue stems from us as adults learning about flaws and mistakes about institutions and people we previously believed to be perfect. As children we go through it a lot, and the process isn\u2019t as shocking; it helps us to accept the mortality of the world we live in. While I definitely believe that being disciples of Christ should help us to be better and rise above prejudiced things of the world, I also acknowledge that mortality doesn\u2019t allow us as a church or institution to transcend and progress faster than society. When I first learned about that type of therapy, I learned about how the world did it; I assumed that byu and the church would have some ties to it. Byu is a research-focused university, and given the churches history in regards to lgbtq+ issues, I assumed that they played some part in it. While no one taught me that at byu, I chose to look into history as an opportunity to learn, not as a way to critique byu. That helped me immensely. \n\nI think a lot of the \u201cskeletons\u201d in the church\u2019s and byu\u2019s closets won\u2019t have their time in the classroom, simply because not every student\u2019s degree needs that. I was able to choose a few classes that got more real and talked about social issues at byu, but it\u2019s up to us to understand our own history and learn how to trust in God\u2019s plan and Jesus Christ\u2019s atonement to help heal those hurt. \n\nAlso in regards to Pres. Oaks. While electroshock therapy is a morally questionable topic now, at the time it was much more of a grey area. (Honestly all of psychology and medicine not too long ago were morally and ethically grey to some extent.) I highly doubt he was actively and keenly aware of all of the research done by every single professor, much less every single graduate student. I wouldn\u2019t expect Pres. Worthen to know what my undergraduate research was about or the details of it. And also our memory is one of the most fallible things in the world. It\u2019s very possible he wasn\u2019t aware of the extent of research being done and if he was, it\u2019s also quite possible that over time his memory has changed. While it\u2019s also possible that he just straight up lied, there\u2019s no way for me to know, so painting him \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d is a pointless activity.",

And that if Harvard were continuing to push a school of thought related to anything that might have been formative to Kaczynski, they'd also discuss connections to experiments he was a part of in the course of their review. \n\nThe church should do the same. It may have stopped using electric shock aversion therapy, but it continues to teach that one way or another people who aren't straight will have to have their orientation changed, even though it has absolutely no idea how that happens or even if it's actually regularly possible, because those who lead the church are *sure* that it's part of key religious teachings. So it could at least cover a history of what's been tried, what hasn't worked, and what they hope will happen.",

Boston Children's Hospital is one such hospital. It is really sick and cruel. [https://www.childrenshospital.org/programs/center-gender-surgery-program](https://www.childrenshospital.org/programs/center-gender-surgery-program)\n\nThe rising numbers of children declaring themselves transgender is an epidemic and it is not natural. It used to be a relatively rare condition, gender dysphoria, among middle aged adult men who thought they were female. Now it is becoming more and more common among young adolescent girls. This is so alarming and no one is asking why. \n\nFurther, even without surgery, incredible damage can be done with puberty blockers. A common puberty blocker, Lupron, is the same drug used to sexually castrate sex offenders. The desired effect of this drug for children is averse. \n\nThere is so much wrong with this whole movement and it is one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever seen happen in our country. It just proves to me how divine the Family Proclamation is. 20 years ago no one saw this coming and people just shrugged when the apostles presented it. They really did see it all coming. The confusion of gender, everything.",

Only rarely does a teen 16 years or older undergo such surgery and only after extensive counseling and years of multi-disciplinary care. \n\nThus your statement that there is a vast transgender surgery movement abusing children is misleading at best. In your attempts to point out a problem you don\u2019t need to exaggerate to the point of being false.",

This is not a story that mainstream media likes to cover, but it is true that many hospitals across the country offer gender surgeries for minors. Even if it is not surgery though, there is still so much damage they can do to kids. Cross-sex hormones, Puberty blockers (the same chemical used to castrate sex offenders). You really see no issue with this at all? Are you living under a rock? This is such a horrible thing happening in our society and it shouldn't be.\n\nIt was only very recently that Boston Children's hospital was offering genital surgery to minors. They removed that from their website when they were caught. So naturally many people seem to believe they are following the rules.

He even did stake outs at gay bars in SLC and fake catfishing advertisements. You can\u2019t tell me with that level of scrutiny that he didn\u2019t know about what they might be trying out to get people to \u201cstop being homosexual\u201d. But at least he took out of the honor code office that \u201cself abuse\u201d wasn\u2019t homosexual activity anymore. \n\nMy problem isn\u2019t the LDS church not advertising what they did. My problem is them not OWNING what they did. They sent a friend of mine to conversion therapy only seven years ago. It was terrible! \n\nOwn your crap. If 12 people said something happened when it did and one \u201ctrusted leader\u201d lies and says it didn\u2019t over and over again. That is called gaslighting. Oaks is a very intelligent man\u2014it\u2019s an insult when he acts dumb.",

It was a common belief that homosexuality could be treated through such an intervention but this became less the case at the 1970s rolled forward. \n\nUnsure that President Oaks is lying about anything--assuming it happened, it may be that he did not know, or this was done as a psychiatric procedure for individual students (in which case, such would have been kept confidential, even in pre-HIPPA days), or it was part of a research study, in which confidentiality rules may have applied, These, and other reasons, could explain why President Oaks and perhaps layers of administrative leaders, would have not known. Not sure about ABC news' sources----even the AP got a lot wrong on sexual abuse allegations, so I am a bit skittish on trusting media sources.\n\nSource:\n\n[https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Mormonism\\_and\\_gender\\_issues/Same-sex\\_attraction/Aversion\\_therapy\\_performed\\_at\\_BYU](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Mormonism_and_gender_issues/Same-sex_attraction/Aversion_therapy_performed_at_BYU)",

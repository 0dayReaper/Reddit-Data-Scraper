The music drowned out any crowd noise, so it\u2019s hardly proof this wouldn\u2019t have EVER occurred in and of itself.  \n\nThere were many others who told of their lived experience in Provo of being called this word, so it is something that is real in the area.  It\u2019s real in Utah; I\u2019ve heard it in Davis County.  We can\u2019t pretend it\u2019s not here.  \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean this happened at a soccer game, but Utah and Provo are not racism free.",

Also, I also worked for byutv, albeit not in sound, I would very surprised if there that many audio sources at a game on the south field. Besides the anchors, there\u2019s what, a couple general field mics and maybe two sound dishes?",

And tell us how their sound engineers focus on crowd noise more than they do on on the song when they're playing the national anthem to the point you can hear individuals saying slurs.\n\nThe majority of people at BYU try to be Christlike and want to make everyone feel loved and accepted, but we're far from perfect.  I think you're being a bit selective when you say you've never heard anyone say a slur at BYU.  I only heard n----r a couple times because there aren't all that many blacks on campus, but I heard b---h, f----t, r----d, M-----n, and c---k in my time there as an undergrad.\n\nInstead of dismissing every criticism of the LDS church or BYU as an exmo conspiracy or an attack by bigots out to get us, it's better to listen and apologize and take steps to prevent it from happening ever again.  If BYU has to put more ushers and security near the visiting teams bench, make a statement or play a video about sportsmanship at the start of each event asking fans to point out unruly spectators, and having a member of the athletic department at each game with a standing policy of stopping play to tell the crowd to behave or all spectators will be removed, then it's less likely that it happens or we nip it in the bud.\n\nIt's fine if competitors from other schools leave our venues feeling dejected because they were dominated on the field of play, but if they're leaving the venue thinking all of us hate them because of their race or appearance then the team and the athletic department are failing at its job of being ambassadors for the school.  The same thing goes for all the schools that have chanted \"F\\*\\*k the Mormons\" at football games in the past decade, like Oregon this year or USC last year or Arizona a few years back.  Since we're on the receiving end of bigotry ourselves and know what it feels like, we ought to take it seriously and go out of our way to make sure it doesn't happen when we're hosting.",

Every single mic is rolling constantly for the entirety of the event, picking up all sounds made in the locality of that mic.

And then he could question the offended BYU fans' motives for making it public.  I mean, there wasn't audio of the Oregon chant, or the USC chant, or the Arizona chant on the broadcast so he doesn't have to apologize right?  That's where you're at right now.\n\nI guess I'm going to have to go with your vast professional experience in large recording sessions in uncontrolled outdoor environments with thousands of people, as we're discussing.  I mean, if you say that that crowd noise as important as a solo vocalist holding a microphone an inch away from their mouth or the PA system during a performance and that an experienced engineer would crank up crowd noise for the national anthem rather than a vocalist's mic they're holding an inch away from their mouth, who am I to question?  I mean, it sounds stupid to me, but if you're saying that the ambient sound recorded on shotgun mics pointed in the general direction of the bleachers running the length of a soccer field and holding ~5,700 people and that the sound quality is good enough to catch what a couple people say then who am I to question your experience?  I think that would be pretty low of me to question your first hand accounts of what happened and diminish your personal experience and question your motives.",

It's easier to just deflect and say that the individual is not racist and move on. This is same in any multiethnic society where majority enjoys privilege.\n\"Equality feels like oppression when you are used to privilege.\"\n\nI like to think it comes from a place of strength to acknowledge shortcomings of an individual and a community that the individual belongs to. And at the same to celebrate small victories and progress to overcome those shortcomings. In case of BYU who would have imagined that the university website would host links to LGBT+ supportive organizations even if official policy does not support those individuals. BYU student body appears more diverse than before. The church has leadership with Asian descent. Lots of things to celebrate while some issues still persist.",

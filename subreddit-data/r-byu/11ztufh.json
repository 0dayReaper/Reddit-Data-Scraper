Are all BYU sited down or is it just me? Do you guys know (maybe someone working on OIT) how long these problems will last?\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I ended calling OIT and it seems there is what the called \"an event\" affecting all the BYU systems and domains and they are working to solve it but without a timeline on when the issue will be solved.",

    "postText": "I was able to visit campus for the week to help out on the project I contributed to as a master\u2019s student. It was nice to be back.\n\nBYU\u2019s campus is in great shape, despite the construction. The Talmage building facelift is nice, and I hope lots of students take advantage of the common spaces and the Math Lab.\n\nI\u2019m so thankful for the professors I had while getting my two BYU degrees. I really really struggled as a young adult, but I was able to make it through with the help of some very patient and kind faculty.\n\nI do grieve that my choice to pursue life outside of the LDS Church puts me at odds with the institution. I think BYU has great things to offer, and I also believe that people who don\u2019t fit the mold have a lot to offer in return. I hope someday it becomes more open to that.\n\nEnjoy the summer, and good luck when the major semester resumes in the fall! Especially good luck to the incoming ACME cohort: stick together as a group, and you\u2019ll get through!",

Even as someone who\u2019s pretty far removed from the church now and was never really TBM during my time there, I don\u2019t hold much animosity toward the school in particular and think it molded me in a way that was very much a net positive. I\u2019ll always remember it for the many incredible people and professors, and the beautiful campus.",

The math department has been trying to build more community among math majors since they\u2019ll often be taking classes with other STEM majors for the first year or two. They\u2019ve made a bunch of majors only sections of first year classes so that you can start meeting people you\u2019ll be working alongside in the future. I also highly recommend the EMC2 program for freshman if you took BC Calc. If you haven\u2019t registered yet or have some flexibility in your schedule, these are great options to look into. You might get a better experience from these vs signing up for a random section of a class. \n\nI also recommend hanging out in the undergrad study rooms on the second floor of the Talmage to meet people and work on homework. You probably can\u2019t use the acme study rooms until you\u2019re in the junior/senior core, but there\u2019s a general math major study room that people are always doing homework in. I never really used the math lab, but I know they divide up the tables by class, so that\u2019s probably also a great place to do homework with people in your classes. \n\nFor your first year, just try to meet lots of people, do well in your classes, and try to get to know your professor if the class is small. Go to office hours if you can. A lot of the connections you\u2019ll need to succeed in the future will come from your classmates and professors.",

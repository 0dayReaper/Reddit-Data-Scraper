    "postText": "Hello! I'm a highschooler currently taking Algebra 2 with BYU and I'm finished with part 1, all I need to do now is take the final exam.\n\nI know that some of the questions require graphing to solve. Will I be expected to have a graphing calculator on hand to answer these? I have been using Desmos during the course because I do not have a graphing calculator. Will that be disallowed during the exam?",

            "comment": "You can do the graphing by hand. What kinds of functions are you graphing? Lines, parabolas, hyperbolas, trigonometric functions, circles, etc.? Usually you can make a pretty quick estimate of the shape of the curve by solving for 3 to 6 points. If you can use a scientific calculator you can reuse the expression you plugged in and only change the x value. With the points you can make a quick sketch of resulting shape.",

This was also targeted at one individual athlete (per the earlier tweet) I wonder why BYU chose not to apologize to her specifically? Or would using her name cause more issues? \n\nI also wonder what can be done about this? You can\u2019t exactly have a security checkpoint into games and have people walk through a \u201cracism detector.\u201d Some ideas that come to mind: security at every game to immediately remove and ban anyone who is breaking rules; hired plants to be in the student section to help manage the flow (I\u2019d guess this was already a thing); a policy that shuts down games when the crowds get out of hand, dismisses the student section, then resumes. \n\nAlternatively BYU needs to actually address the culture of racism at the school. There are many ways that could be addressed:\nAdding curriculum to one of the general requirements for all students on racial awareness;\nPublic support when social study teachers are attacked for teaching socialized race in society;\nOpenly admitting falling short and publicly apologizing for mistakes;\nOffering scholarships and help positions for BIPOC \u2014 since interacting with minorities is the best way to create empathy and breakdown stereotypes having more BIPOC students would help. BYU has 6.4% BIPOC faculty compared to the national average of 24%. That\u2019s bad. BYU has .4% black students compared to the national average of 12%. That\u2019s really bad. If BYU\u2019s racist reputation is too strong to get local students to apply then we should be bringing in international students who need the education much more than Americans do. \n\nTo be clear, yes, I am suggesting that where two equally qualified candidites apply for a position at BYU, but one is white, and another is black, BYU should admit the black student. Heck, even if they\u2019re less qualified. BYU, and by extension the church, should be using its resources to help the historically marginalized. The funds used to subsidize a BYU education are charitable donations. Let those more qualified people go get other academic scholarships at more prestigious universities. \n\nSorry, got a bit carried away.  /rant",

The person is the one responsible for what was said, so it should be that individual to issue a direct apology.\n\n&gt;what can be done about this\n\nExactly what BYU did do. Permanently banned from all BYU sports in the future. It's the appropriate action. They should have kicked the person from the event ASAP though.\n\n&gt;security at every event\n\nThis is already a thing.\n\n&gt;hired plants to be in the student section\n\nThis is almost certainly not done, and wouldn't be done. It's weird. It's securities' job to deal with these people.\n\n&gt;a policy that shuts down games when the crows gets out of hand, dismisses the student section, then resumes\n\nBYU tends to be a mild school compared to almost every other school on the planet. BYU's student section rarely gets \"out of hand.\" Such a policy almost certainly exists, but you won't see it much if ever because of the type of people BYU students are.\n\n&gt;BYU needs to address the culture of racism at the school\n\nThey just permabanned a racist.\n\n&gt;curriculum to one of the general requirements for all students on racial awareness\n\nThe person banned was not a student and would therefore not take such a class at BYU.\n\nThe rest of the rant I'm not engaging with.",

So I could see a scenario where BYU also suspending the perp at the same time they banned them from all sporting events so that they could \u201ctruthfully\u201d say they weren\u2019t a student.

These are kids who would keep themselves from cussing to be \u201csin free\u201d before they went on their missions but racial slurs were cool with them.\n\nThere are a bunch of factors are at play as to why some would be at best severely ignorant and worst maliciously racist, and there are good and bad at every university. But BYU and honestly the church at large need to root this shit out of the culture. Zero tolerance.

Fans nearby should have also heard it and pointed him out to ushers/security as it happened, but he wasn\u2019t escorted out or detained.

    "postText": "I haven\u2019t checked college rankings for a few years, but in the just released rankings by US News, BYU is #89, down from #66 in 2015.\n\nNow, I know there are other ranking services out there. I\u2019m not looking for apples-to-oranges responses defending our alma mater using other ranking services. Just curious why US News is moving BYU down.\n\nEDIT #1: Came back to include the BYU webpage that has annual admissions and enrollment data going back 20 years, in case anyone is inclined to do some stats homework: https://assessmentandplanning.byu.edu/common-data-set \n\nAlso, here is BYU's yearly ranking by US News going back 17 years (all I could find). BYU's ranking steadily improved from 2007 to 2014, hitting its best ranking of #62, then started declining to its current #89. There is a clear downward trend beginning in 2015.\n\n2022 = #89\n\n2021 = #79\n\n2020 = #77\n\n2019 = #77\n\n2018 = #63\n\n2017 = #61\n\n2016 = #68\n\n2015 = #66\n\n2014 = #62\n\n2013 = #62\n\n2012 = #68\n\n2011 = #71\n\n2010 = #75\n\n2009 = #71\n\n2008 = #113 (seems odd to me)\n\n2007 = #79\n\nEDIT #2: Found the US News ranking criteria (https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/ranking-criteria-and-weights). In terms of year-over-year things I'm noticing in the raw data from BYU (https://assessmentandplanning.byu.edu/common-data-set), the acceptance rate has been going up the past few years, which might be affecting the \"Student Selectivity\" score relative to other schools, and the number of PHD's being awarded by BYU appears to be declining, which might be impacting its \"Faculty Resources\" score. Again, even if BYU is seeing improvements in avg GPA and ACT/SAT scores, if other schools are seeing bigger improvements in those areas, they could be moving ahead of us for that reason. Finally, as others have suggested, we could be taking some big hits to our peer assessment survey, which is 20% of the score, due to all of the issues we've faced in the news recently. Those would be my guesses as to why we're falling, without doing some in-depth statistical analysis of the data from BYU and comparing it to the data from the schools that are moving ahead of us. \n \n22% = Graduation &amp; Retention Rates\n\n 5% = Social Mobility\n\n 8% = Graduation Rate Performance\n\n20% = Undergraduate Academic Reputation (Peer Assessment Survey)\n\n20% = Faculty Resources\n\n 7% = Student Selectivity (SAT/ACT scores, class ranking, etc)\n\n10% = Financial Resources per student\n\n 3% = Average Alumni Giving Rate\n\n 5% = Graduate Indebtedness\n\n----\n\n100% = Total Score",

This one looks at just graduation rates, which I think is a good start.\n\nhttps://www.collegetuitioncompare.com/amp/trends/brigham-young-university-provo/graduation-rate/",

When you started this string with the comment \"I wouldn't be shocked if COVID played a significant impact with some of these statistics looking worse,\" I interpreted that to infer the drop in BYU's ranking is due to COVID impacting is stats. My response was to point out that COVID should impact the stats of all schools and couldn't be used as an explanation for BYU's drop in the rankings.\n\nGlancing at the data on the BYU website ([https://assessmentandplanning.byu.edu/common-data-set](https://assessmentandplanning.byu.edu/common-data-set)), BYU has had the following graduation rates going back 10 years. Seems pretty consistent with prior years. \n\n2022 = 76.7%\n\n2021 = 77.8%\n\n2020 = 78.0%\n\n2019 = 83.0%\n\n2018 = 83.0%\n\n2017 = 83.0%\n\n2016 = 80.0%\n\n2015 = 79.0%\n\n2014 = 77.0%\n\n2013 = 77.0%\n\nAlso, I pulled the year-over-year retention rates going back 10 years. This is the percentage of students who come back in the fall. So, it doesn't look like COVID impacted how many people stayed enrolled at BYU during the pandemic.\n\n2021 = 89.0%\n\n2020 = 91.0%\n\n2019 = 90.0%\n\n2018 = 90.0%\n\n2017 = 90.0%\n\n2016 = 90.0%\n\n2015 = 86.0%\n\n2014 = 87.0%\n\n2013 = 89.0%\n\n2012 = 89.0%",

It's not only because BYU has a great academic reputation, but also because a lot of BYU grads are upstanding and clean-cut (no criminal records, no drug usage, etc.). Makes the hiring process a lot easier.",

Are we losing reputation among employers, is our faculty losing academic respect, is the admissions rate increasing making us less exclusive, etc? \n\nNot looking for people to get defensive and throw out unsubstantiated claims.

Except for a few places the school cut many graduate programs. At the same time school admissions were capped by the trustees to right around 30,000. These self limiting factors changed things up but that kind of metric isn\u2019t well represented. \n\nIt is likely with the reaffirmed stance that BYU is a unique school and should not worry about worldly accolades or trends will only push the schools rating down for better or worse depending on your opinion. \n\nSo things will change again and the numbers will fluctuate.",

All you have to do is Google \u201cBYU\u201d and \u201crankings\u201d and most of the results are our own press releases.\n\nOne could argue rankings shouldn\u2019t matter and would be accurate. One could argue rankings  don\u2019t matter and that would be inaccurate. Unfortunately, they still do, and in a big way.\n\nEDIT: And alumni like myself have no problem touting our law school, business school ranking improvements. We just can\u2019t have it both ways. If the undergraduate rankings are slipping, it should be analyzed.",

Note that the retention and graduation rates are quite low. Much of these lower student achievement measures result from a good proportion of students serving full-time missions, but if US News does not waive BYU due missionary service, then student achievement measures will always be low compared to peers.\n\nOn another note, BYU has Ph.D. programs but tends to send a large proportion of students to other graduate schools. I think better measures would be student-faculty ratios, percentage of alumni giving each year, and percentage of faculty with terminal degrees...",

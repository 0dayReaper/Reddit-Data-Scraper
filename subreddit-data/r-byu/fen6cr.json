His great-grandmother, Louine Clawson (granddaughter of Brigham), married her 2nd cousin Seymour Bicknell Young (grandson of Joseph.)\n\nHe's also from Emily Dow Partridge, one of Brigham's wives who also happened to be the daughter of Edward Partridge, the first LDS bishop!",

Her sister was also married to Joseph and neither sister knew about their marriage to Joseph despite living in the same house. Of course, both marriages were kept secret from Emma as well.",

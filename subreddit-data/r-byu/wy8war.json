Go to the basement (2nd floor) and find the large lockers and someone should be able to point you in the right direction. (It\u2019s very tricky to find, a rite of passage for music majors) just don\u2019t mention you\u2019re not a music major and see what they say. If not they can point you in the right direction of who can",

    "postText": "I got an ebook version of the Bio 130 textbook this semester, \"biological science, 20th edition\" ( I had Byron and Jerry) for quite a bit cheaper than they were trying to sell it on learning suite. It was around $75 on learning suite if I remember correctly, I got mine for I think around $60. I'm wanting to sell it for around $30 if anyone taking Bio next semester needs this textbook and wants to save some money :) Private message me if you're interested!",

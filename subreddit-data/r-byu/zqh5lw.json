    "postText": "I want to take some religion courses from BYU. I'm currently at the U (I know, sorry) but have an easy schedule coming up this next semester. I want to know more about the LDS religion and might want to take an independent study class on the topic. I also want this to be a tester because I might look to transfer, so side question, are any independent study courses on campus?\n\nMy main question is, do I get a BYU ID if I'm only an independent study student? Asking cause I might want to use some gym facilities with my friends that go there and don't really want to pay the $8 guest fee. I couldn't really find anything on the website about it. Thanks for any answers.",

You can take classes online and you can probably take tests at the U. I took classes in Nebraska and went to the local community college for a testing center.\n\n  If the U has an institute near by, you might look into enrolling there. It's free, no grades, and there's usually free food too. I'm sure the institute director would be happy to answer any questions. I bet your friends might even come with. Institute is usually very social.",

They wouldn\u2019t make you take it there because you can take it from any state, but you do have the option to take your tests on campus I think.\n\nI took independent study courses while an admitted student, so it\u2019s possible to do both, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking, although rules change so you might want to call and confirm.",

It was on the completely other end of campus\u2014the side of campus nearest to the Missionary Training Center and the old Provo temple.\n\nAlso congrats on your decision to explore the religion. Good luck on that journey. BYU is a little cheaper than the U, at least at the tuition rate that church members get. The nonmember rate might still be cheaper too.",

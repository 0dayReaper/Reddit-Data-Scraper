But with most mental health counselors already overbooked (especially at universities), it might be weeks or even months before they can meet with someone. When someone you know is an immediate threat to themselves, that's clearly not an option, and a hospital can at least treat the most immediate needs.",

Because \"support\" is all they need?\n\nNews flash: unless you're a licensed medical professional, you probably don't know how to help that person. Suicidal feelings, depression, etc., aren't just \"the big sad\", and no amount of \"good vibes\" and \"emotional support\" will change that. That's like trying to treat a broken arm with a bowl of soup and a good night's sleep.\n\nAgain, I'm not arguing that you stick them in a straitjacket and let the men in white coats carry them away to lock them away until the end of time; I'm saying when someone has a crisis, a short-term hospital stay can help them avert that crisis and form a longer-term care plan that *doesn't* require them to stay in the hospital.",

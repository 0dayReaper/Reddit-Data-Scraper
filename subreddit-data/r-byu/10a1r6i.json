Anyone have any tips that I can use to actually solve problems in physics?\n\nTo give you a better idea of what I am already doing:\n- Working on the HW everyday.\n- Reading the textbook.\n- Going to the physics lab to ask TAs for help if needed.\n- Attending lecture.\n\nThe worst part is, when I read the textbook and attend lecture I understand the concepts. It\u2019s just, in the homework with the harder questions, I suddenly don\u2019t.\n\nAny advice? Or will I get better as I continue in this class?\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the responses and the advice. I am now in fact living in the TA office and they are extremely helpful! I'm starting to actually feel more confident in this class, understand the concepts, and even help others with their homework too.",

            "comment": "As someone who has TAed introductory physics both as an undergrad and graduate student, I may have some helpful tips for you:\n\nFirst, if you understand the concepts but can't do the homework questions, you don't actually understand the concepts. I know that sounds blunt, but it's an unfortunate reality that you come to realize after years of doing physics homework. When you're reading through the textbook, you need to work through the example problems, too (*before* looking at the solutions). If you struggle with the example problem, go read the section for what you're struggling with, then try again. The concepts and material will stick a lot better when you study with a specific problem in mind.\n\nSecond, you should review old material periodically. It's early in the semester, but problems later in the course will start synthesizing material from old topics. For example, when you study equilibrium problems later in the semester, you'll have homework problems that will force you to use all your newfound knowledge of torque in conjunction with your old knowledge of forces. Your textbook is a reference, not a novel, so there's no problem with flipping back to an old chapter and looking up something you forgot.\n\nThird, don't ever *just* reread the textbook. Education research shows that rereading is one of the worst ways to study because it creates the *illusion* of familiarity with the material due to familiarity with the text. Rereading should only be done when you're looking up something specific that you don't understand, i.e., you're working on a problem and hit a roadblock.\n\nFourth, the TA lab and working with friends should *never* be the first thing you try. By the time you're walking into the lab or sitting down with a study group, you should have already worked on the problem you can't figure out. In particular, when you ask for help, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n\n* What does your diagram of the problem look like?\n* What do you know?\n* What are you looking for?\n* What else do you need to get that?\n* What have you tried?\n\nLastly, relax and be patient with yourself. You're learning a new thing and being forced to think a little differently. You may not have a lot of intuition for how these problems work, and it takes a lot of practice to get there. I got an A in Physics 121 back in 2016, but it wasn't until the second time I TAed the class that I actually understood it, and even as a graduate student I still make mistakes on \"easy\" mechanics problems.",

But there is always that one question that I absolutely cannot figure out.\n\nI always draw the problem out. I know what I have and what I am looking for. I can identify what I need to find out. It's usually always the ***how*** I get what I have despite having all the information available. Which is usually how I make the problem more complicated than it really is.",

It will feel unnatural and difficult for a long time, but one day you'll sit down and realize that you suddenly know what you're doing.\n\nI'd also like to take this moment to put in a plug for the physics faculty at BYU -- they really do know what they're doing (most of them, anyway). Unlike a lot of other research universities, BYU's physics department puts a lot of effort into making sure their faculty, particularly for introductory courses, know how to teach. It might be frustrating at times or seem like they give you a lot of work, but I promise that they know what they're doing; as much as I love the work I'm doing as a graduate student, most of my classes have not been taught anywhere near as well as my average BYU physics class.",

It's an extra bonus if all that works out to be at a less busy time. Back in my day, there was a group of 3 or 4 that would be there late Wednesday nights doing their homework, and since they were the only ones there, they pretty much had me as a free private tutor all semester long. Week after week, I learned what they struggled with, and which explanations seemed to help and what didn't.\n\nIdea 2: figure out if you're struggling with the physics or the math. Maybe it's both, but often it's just one. It can help from down to what you need to practice.\n\nIdea 3: if you know what you need to figure out but are unsure how, list everything you know and what you need and literally look for an equation that has all those things in it. Sometimes it's that simple.",

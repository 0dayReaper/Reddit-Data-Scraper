How would these complainers react if:\n\nTom Holmoe announces that legacy season ticket holders can now access their tickets they\u2019ve had for years BUT it\u2019s only made possible because the demand has dropped significantly. Why? Because Holmoe heard the fans and BYU has decided to reject the Big 12 and join the SUNBELT conference.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/12frtsi)",

Legacy season ticket holders are now not getting a shot at renewing and if they are the good tickets are all gone. Basically, they\u2019re mad they\u2019d have to pay more now that BYU is in the Big 12.",

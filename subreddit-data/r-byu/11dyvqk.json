It wasn't a hard class. I remember thinking it was kind of a perfect class, because I learned tons, but I never felt like it was overwhelming. I don't remember the professor's name, but it was an older guy.\n\nIS303 is a pretty easy class (or it was when I took it). Gary Hansen was my professor, and he's retired now. If you've ever done any programming, the class would probably be laughably easy for you. But I had a friend in the class who had never programmed before, and he did struggle a bit, so your mileage may vary.",

It was super easy, so you'll be fine. \n\nIS 303 is one of the classes that us Computer Science majors would take to get a free IS minor. If you've programmed a bit before, it will be super easy. If you can pass CS 111 and possibly CS235, IS 303 will be a walk in the park. Might be tough I'd you don't have coding experience though.",

Nicer apartments and still very good socializing since it\u2019s all freshman dorms. \n\nIf you feel like you\u2019d still rather live at Helaman, I\u2019d say get one of the meal plans that gives you dining dollars. That way you can use them anywhere on campus (any creamery, the Cougareat, vending machines, the cannon center, any on campus restaurant). It\u2019s just much more versatile and then you\u2019re not stuck only eating at the cannon center every meal of every day. \n\nAlso if you end up living at heritage, you can get a smaller meal plan that is like $400 a semester (or just dining dollars themselves) to make it so you don\u2019t have to cook for yourself all the time or you can get stuff on campus if you have a long study day. The advantage of that over just using real money is that you get more dining dollars than dollars you spend (I think it\u2019s like 250 dining dollars for $200 real dollars) and you get tax free purchases when using dining dollars.",

People from Heritage will actually travel across campus to eat at the cannon and meet people decently often. P.s. get the dining dollar meal plan so you can eat anywhere on campus. In between classes you won\u2019t want to have to walk down to the cannon",

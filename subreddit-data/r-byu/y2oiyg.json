IS201 is very hands on coding, so be prepared for that. I would suggest if you truly want to enjoy your freshman year, you should break up those classes into different semesters.",

I found Fin 201 with Brau really interesting and informative, but I had to teach myself probably a majority of the course through the textbook. I took Econ 110 the semester after Covid, so it was all on Zoom, but I guess I enjoyed it enough because I'm going to graduate in April with a degree in Economics. I am currently an Econ 110 TA and it's similar to Finance--there's so much information for an introductory course that you have to put in time with all the readings and homework and the professor just goes over the most important stuff. The kids who are doing the best in the class are those who regularly spend hours in the TA lab and devote enough time to really understand the concepts. At least with Econ, literally everything builds on past concepts, so you need to put in work to understand the fundamental concepts or you'll be lost for the rest of the semester. Hope this helps!",

Can I get away with not paying it if I never drive it on campus again? Is that ethical? I don\u2019t want to grow through the process to contest it but I don\u2019t want to pay for it either\u2026",

I forgot to activate my registration online once and was able to get a ticket waived when I showed proof that I had paid for registration that should have been active at the time!",

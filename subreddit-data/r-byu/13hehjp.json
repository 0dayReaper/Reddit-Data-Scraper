Virtually every building has a bike back. I'm pretty sure the JKB, which is across the street from the Tanner Building has a covered bike rack, for when it might rain.\n\nThe best bike rack on campus is the one in the LSB parking garage, but that's further from the Tanner Building. \n\nYou could also consider getting a waterproof bike cover that folds up in your backpack, if you want to park your bike at an outdoor bike rack, and don't want your bike to get wet. \n\nDefinitely don't lock up your bike anywhere that isn't a designated bike rack, campus police could end up confiscating it.\n\nEdit: For some reason I realize I mixed up the business school with the law school, so just replace \"Tanner Building\" with \"Law Building\". Still the advice is the same the covered bike racks I know of are at the LSB and JKB",

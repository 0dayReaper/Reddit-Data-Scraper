    "postText": "It's insane the amount of math classes that just assign webassign exercises or websites to learn math. Are there any classes that have more of an old school format? Like having a physical textbook or doing most problems by hand, maybe even some worksheets?\n\nI'm just not a fan of webassign, and the limitations that come with it (only a certain number of tries, grading based on how many tries it took), I also feel like I dont learn as well as having worksheets or physical paper to refer to, and the worst thing is that after a while I lose access to all the math problems I did and even If i wanted to refer back to them in the future they are gone.",

            "comment": "For most  webassign problems you can click \u201cpractice another version\u201d and get a similar question with different numbers. This should help you if you\u2019re really worried about the limited attempts. Just practice until you feel confident you can get the right answer.\n\nAlso the math lab is a great resource I wish more people took advantage of. Although, I admit it\u2019s most useful if you can go during the off peak hours, so earlier in the morning from my experience.\n\nAs far as why the department does it? I\u2019ve heard faculty mention three main reasons. \n1) instantaneous feedback is actually very valuable in the learning experience. How useful is it to you really to get your homework back a week later and see you got an answer wrong when you\u2019re already three topics ahead of that homework now?\n2) When hundreds of students are taking the same course during the semester (like calc 1 or 2) webassign and common exams help the experience be more uniform across the different sections.\n3) in classes with both webassign and written homework, webassign allows graders to leave more personal comments on the written assignments since they aren\u2019t grading as much. In practice this might not always happen, but that\u2019s part of the reason in theory.\n\nEdit: if you absolutely want to avoid webassign, during the spring and summer terms teachers often have a bit more flexibility in how they structure their courses. I\u2019ve seen some of them ditch webassign.",

    "postText": "After reading this recent New Yorker article, I'm curious to know how this effect is playing out on BYU campus. Basically, the idea is that the English major (and other humanities majors) used to be extremely popular in the past, had been on a slow decline for a while, and suddenly nosedived in the past 10 years. One of the many reasons discussed in the article is the perception that college is for preparing for a career and the ROI on these majors is low. (There are other reasons, but I'll leave that to your reading pleasure.)\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/the-end-of-the-english-major\n\nA few questions:\n1 - What would your ideal major be if money (either for college or in a career afterwards) was no object?\n2 - What are you actually majoring and why?",

And while there is a good deal of problem solving in CS, I began to feel like most of the problems actively being worked on by CS grads today are business problems, which in reality, boil down to just one singular problem: \"How do I make more money?\"  \n\n\nThose aren't the sort of problems I want to solve. I want to solve real problems, faced by real people. Problems whose solutions have a genuine effect for good in the world, and that truly bring goodness to people's lives. A lot of engineering majors would allow me to do this, but the EC EN major seemed to be a good fit, due to my CS background.  \n\n\nI'm not saying that Computer Engineering grads don't make any money. I'm sure some make a whole lot. I'm sure some are even millionaires. Even so, compared to CS, jobs for Computer Engineering are not nearly as plentiful, nor nearly as easy to get.  \n\n\nSo the fact that I deliberately left a more lucrative field tells me that money is not a terribly huge influence to me.\n\nEdit: Also, I got tired of how abstract and high level software engineering tends to be. I want to work directly with hardware.",

What are you actually majoring and why?\n\nI wanted to major in Political Philosophy, but BYU did not offer that major. Political Science was the closest. Either way, it was a stepping stone for Law School. The Poli Sci Department was VERY clear that there was no money in Poli Sci unless you went to law school or went on to get an advanced degree. Poli Sci studies were very interesting to me and matched my interests.  I went to BYU when 9/11 happened.  Fascinating time to be a Poli Sci major.\n\nIf had to do it all over again, I would've went for the nursing program for undergrad and still gone to law school. Nursing would've been a great fall back career and would've made for good student jobs while doing undergrad.",

            "comment": "I might be more of an edge case, but not a lot. I became really passionate about engineering sometime after high school and was really excited to study it in school. That worked out because it happened to be a decent paying profession. That being said, if the latter weren't the case then money would probably have been a bigger consideration solely because financial stability is something that I want to gain from my education. If music were my passion I probably would have studied something more lucrative and done music as a minor or on the side.",

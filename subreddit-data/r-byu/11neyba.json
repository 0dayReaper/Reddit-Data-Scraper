    "postText": "Just the title. I'm planning on taking most of the Chinese language courses at BYU and want to take 201 this spring so I can be in 301 by next winter. Has anyone taken Chinese 201 spring semester? How hard is it/would it be manageable if I also plan on working this spring?? Looking for any and all advice\u270c\ud83c\udffb",

You basically have a week to internalize and learn 20-40 words plus multiple grammatical principles and it takes time. I was holding on by the seat of my pants just in Fall semester and you would have half the time I did. If you pick up Chinese quickly or you are ready to dedicate all your free time studying I say go for it, but otherwise I strongly recommend against it.",

            "comment": "Chinese 201 is a gigantic step up in difficulty and work from the 100-level classes, and that's before factoring in the shortened time you have to do it. If you're prepared to spend most of your available time on the class (not kidding) then by all means do it, though. People make it work, apparently.",

    "postText": "Hey yall,\n\nLooking for anyone that can help me who has completed the full IB diploma and got into BYU. I am international (did not study in US). I did complete the IB Diploma which according to a BYU guide is considered  US-accredited high school work. \n\nDoes this mean it will not need to be evaluated by a third-party evaluator? I do not have a GPA of any sort which seems important, if I order IB to directly e-mail or mail a copy of my official results, will BYU consider these results? \n\nAlso, generally, is there any actually helpful people from BYU I can potentially zoom call?\n\nThankyou",

That being said, Provo isn't really representative of all college towns. The lack of alcohol and no night scene is pretty unique and potentially allows for a safer campus at night.\n\nStill, I'm glad BYU has been pushing consent training. Hopefully this will drive down spousal rapes and other forms of sexual harassment like non consensual kissing/hugging.",

I know that doesn't seem that long ago, but that was 7 years ago. Since then, the rule has been that if someone gets assaulted while breaking the honor code, they will not get punished for it.\n\nI'm very familiar with this issue fyi. There are studies assessing whether things like religious guilt affect people's answers on an anonymous survey. They haven't found there to be any influence. You're just speculating at this point because you don't like the conclusion I drew from the mountains of data I cited in the article. I would suggest reading all the cited studies and data in my article before you accuse me of being disingenuous or not knowing what I'm talking about.\n\nLastly, your comment doesn't even begin to address the clear relationship between alcohol consumption and sexual assault. Given that numerous studies have established that there is a link, and that BYU is a dry campus, why wouldn't it make sense that BYU's rates are so low? I made a lot of different points in that article with data to back up most of them. It would behoove you to address all of them instead of bringing up the same old tired rebuttal I've gotten from pretty much every other critic I've discussed this issue with.",

If BYU students are getting in trouble for getting sexually assaulted while breaking the honor code then the Salt Lake Tribune would be all over that, so I would be interested in any recent evidence of this after the 2016-2017 school year.\n\nlol So you're argument is basically \"they're all just lying\"? Seriously? It's well known by any social scientist that is moderately familiar with this issue that alcohol consumption of LDS populations is EXTREMELY low. Add  the fact that they're at a religious university that doesn't allow alcohol and you get low alcohol consumption rates. No my friend.

They were asked to rate their answers on a likert scale for the following questions: Sexual harassment is not tolerated at BYU; BYU is doing a good job of providing needed services to victims of sexual assault; BYU takes training in sexual assault prevention seriously; BYU is doing a good job of holding people accountable for committing sexual assault; BYU is doing a good job of educating students about sexual assault.\n\nWhile the answers to those questions showed room for improvement, the vast majority of students answered in the affirmative.

    "postText": "Hi! I'm a freshman at BYU who has never experienced cold weather (California girl). Like I'm talking 60s in the winter, and 40s as the low at most, with no snow ever. I get cold really, really quickly, and I was wondering if anyone could point me to some cute jackets (for reference, I'm 5'10, 140 pounds, and a girl) that would still be able to keep me warm. Also, any tips? Literally how does the winter go, does everyone take off their jackets in class, like do people wear hoodies under jackets, literally any tips that you can give me to help me survive the winter? I already have a good pair of snow boots, but I have no idea what to expect. Thank you!!",

Like, I'll wear garments, t shirt, sweater, coat (and maybe a hoodie if it's bitter), then a coat, scarf, and gloves.\n\nMy outer coat is a relatively light one, so that it's modular. I can stow it in my backpack or locker and still have layers on. The winter does get cold, but it's pretty sunny too. For your first big one, I'd recommend investing in a long scarf and good hat. Walk quickly, watch out for ice, cover your head and face: so much heat escapes through the top.",

I like the $20 combat boots from Walmart, waterproof them with waterproofing spray, and wear with warm socks and a pair of insoles. \n\nLayers are your friend. Provo is pretty warm (comparatively, I'm from Vermont,) so you really shouldn't need a fullblown hooded wool peacoat. I would get a hoodie and a windbreaker or raincoat, (something waterproof) and just layer yourself. \n\nMy personal favorite way to stay warm is scarves. I have a bunch that I call \"Dead Body Scarves\" because they are approximately the size of a blanket and can cover a dead body if you need to. They can be shawls, scarves, head covers, nursing covers, blankets, etc. I've found a couple that fit in my backpack and can be pulled through a ring because they're so thin, but they do wonders to keep you warm.",

If you\u2019re like me and had several miles to walk each day between classes, then snow boots might not be sustainable. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to walk through drifts, you need something that\u2019ll handle slushy puddles and general cold that is also comfortable to walk in. \n\nUgg boots got popular for a reason. :) But anything that goes past the ankle, is waterproofable, and is comfortable to walk in should be fine. Hiking boots, work boots, uggs, whatever.",

            "comment": "My number one piece of advice in coat buying is to get a coat that covers your butt. It was a game changer for me.\n\nAs for cold weather dressing, layers are your friend. You'll be inside more than outside so you also need to dress for a heated room no matter how cold it is outside. I have a heavy coat that is for extreme cold days (maybe a couple weeks in the year) and winter nights and a lighter coat for the rest of winter. If you can only get one, get a lighter coat you'll get more use out of it. I would also say that I never used snow boots going to school at BYU. They were too hot in class. I usually wore ankle rain boats with wool socks. Provo is more wet winter than snowy winter so it's more like you gotta prepare for the wet rather than the snow. A lot of people use umbrellas during the winter for this reason. If I wasn't from Seattle, I would've done that too but it was too against my cultural upbringing (umbrellas = tourist).\n\nI invested in cold weather pieces for my mission, and even after that much wear and tear, I think they will last me for years to come. I went from someone who absolutely *hated* the cold, to someone who didn't really mind it all that much. I attribute that to not being so uncomfortable outside. So if you have the budget, I recommend getting high quality pieces. \n\nSteep and Cheap is my favorite place to get outdoor gear (especially clothing) for a deal: https://www.steepandcheap.com/",

If you don\u2019t have 8 am classes you can largely avoid a lot of the cold times to be out and about, to the point where you can survive with minimal warm clothing. Seconding wearing layers, you don\u2019t want to have a gigantic snow coat and then nothing else. You can probably survive off a jacket outer layer, some sort of sweater and a shirt just fine.",

For bottoms, thicker jeans or lined leggings would be fine.\n\nI'd recommend a light waterproof shell for your jacket, and a warm mid-layer that you can wear with or without the shell. Something like a fleece jacket, with an uninsulated rain jacket on top. You can also find \"3-in-1\" jackets that do this exact thing.\n\nIf money is of no concern, I would get a Patagonia fleece and hardshell, then call it a day.",

You can go out and buy a $200 coat that will keep you nice and toasty (I\u2019d recommend north face if you go that route) or you can buy something adequate from old navy or Costco. The important pieces are gloves, socks, and a hat. Costco sells nice running gloves that will keep your hands warm without being bulky, a nice pair of wool socks will make a big difference, and just about any hat will do. And if you\u2019re a garment wearer, I would highly recommend a couple pairs of thermal garments!",

During the day when it is sunny, but cold, you can usually wear a hoodie with a light / medium puffy coat over it and stay warm.\n\nBUT, if you are doing anything at night, early morning, or way up in the mountains in the snow, then you need a heavier coat.\n\nGot real cold once standing in line outside of vivint arena in December at night wearing my winter daytime layers, that wasn't fun.  Learned my lesson, winter at night = always bring heavier coat and gloves.\n\nLots of good places to get heavier coats.  Costco is usually a good starting point if you have access, or go with someone that does.  You get what you pay for.  I still have a heavy Colombia coat i bought 20 years ago.",

            "comment": "My main tip is to make sure your outer most layer is both windproof and waterproof, anything you wear underneath just needs to be warm if your outer layer meets those two requirements. Another redditor mentioned Columbia or North Face, i second that, kinda pricey for a college student, but worth it. I had North Face jacket for about 7 years, went through lots of wear and tear (camping, skiing, sledding etc) before it finally kicked the bucket. I currently have a Columbia jacket, ajd it's one of the 2 in 1 that has a removable inner layer.\nI've lived in some pretty cold places, and having that windproof layer makes a huge difference.",

The building will be warm so you won\u2019t need anything too thick under the jacket.",

When it\u2019s above about 35 degrees (which it usually is), I wear a sweatshirt under a big jean jacket because if I wear a coat, I get so hot walking to class that I have to take all my layers off and carry them around. Not worth it to me!\n\nIt you have some money to drop, get a fancy fake-down coat from a sportswear company. I had one in high school and wore it in 20-degree weather with gloves, a hat, and a sweatshirt or 2 (1 under, one over). Here\u2019s a link to one similar to the one I had:\n\nhttps://www.eddiebauer.com/p/38925402/women's-microtherm(r)-2.0-down-jacket?sp=1&amp;color=Dusty%20Blue\n\nGood luck staying warm, and remember that wind is your real enemy!",

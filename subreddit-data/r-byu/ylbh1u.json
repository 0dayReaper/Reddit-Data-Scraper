    "postText": "I recently took the Korean Challenge Exam to test out of Korean 101, 102, 201, and 202, in total worth 16 credits of classes. I asked around quite a bit and couldn't find any information on how to prepare for the exam. I managed to receive an A grade for all 16 credits and I wanted to share some useful tips to prepare.\n\nYou don't have to worry too much about vocabulary; make sure you have a good number under your belt, but if you could communicate decently on your mission, you're probably going to be okay. Maybe study some school-related vocabulary (semester, major, professor, etc.)\n\nIn terms of grammar, make sure you know everything in the Korean Grammar in Use: Beginning book (the yellow one pictured below). The intermediate book (green, also pictured below) is also good to study. You really need to learn -\ub300\uc694 and \ub290\ub77c\uace0 (especially as used at the end of a sentence).\n\nYou should do pretty well, don't stress about it. Remember -- the Challenge Exam can only help your grade, not hurt it. Good luck!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Know EVERYTHING in this book](https://preview.redd.it/228uimcw9sx91.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=85d72d8fcd5654eeb073a6a20cb959c0ae368366)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Study this, at least be able to recognize the grammar forms. Become very familiar with all uses of the \ub290\ub77c\\/\ub290\ub77c\uace0 forms \\(used both in the middle and as an ending of a sentence\\).](https://preview.redd.it/jgzsmkvx9sx91.png?width=353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b3731a4b281a84a3a48f2c5cd0c9aa5662ff90dd)",

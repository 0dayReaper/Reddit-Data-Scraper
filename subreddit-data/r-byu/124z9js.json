I still need around 53 more responses and I only have one week left, so all of you and those you know are invited to fill it out if you haven\u2019t done so already!  \n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMogUtxOMMqC017Mq14P6nY5hsV5S7kCy7cWeHgvVmYz-OdA/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMogUtxOMMqC017Mq14P6nY5hsV5S7kCy7cWeHgvVmYz-OdA/viewform)",

I would definitely answer yes in every single one, because at some point I've felt this way about some product at some time. But I find it doubtful that the app you develop will address each of those different kinds of products.",

The growth of coverage is measured by what stores are linked to it, and with more stores come more products. The first few stores connected would be overarching ones like Amazon, Walmart, Ebay, Target, etc., so the range of products would already be large right off the bat. What stores come next would be based on the feedback y'all provide.",

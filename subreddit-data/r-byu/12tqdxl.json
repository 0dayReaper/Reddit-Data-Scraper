I have wanted to meet with some people who might be struggling keeping their finances in order and help them organize it all. One of the main things would helping them create a new monthly budget. \n\nI have created this google form to help me organize the sign up list. Message me for the link to the form or for more information on this.",

It tracks accounts, credit cards, investments, 401k, mortgage, house value, etc. and puts it all into one nice dashboard.\n\nIt also has suggestions for budgets and to start planning for your future and retirement",

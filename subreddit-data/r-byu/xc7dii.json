    "postText": "Being one of the largest religious educational institutions in the country (and the world), I find it odd that BYU doesn't have a theology department, at least in the traditional sense. Yes, there are the required religion credits, however those would be considered Theology 101 level courses in any other institution. We don't have any upper level theology courses. On top of that, we don't have any undergraduate majors or minors in theology. There is some graduate level programs, however those are exceptionally competitive and are meant to train seminary and institute teachers. They aren't theology degrees in the traditional sense.\n\nI understand the rationale why the Church doesn't have that department -- typically, a theology degree is used to go into ministry, and seeing as how the Church doesn't have a paid clergy, a Latter-day Saint Bachelor's in Theology would prove to be a fairly useless degree in the job market.\n\nThat being said, I'm curious if there's any interest in that sort of thing at BYU? Is there anyone else out there interested in academic theology? If so, maybe we could make a club?",

Professors like Eugene England published theological pieces in independent journals that upset the leadership back in the 80's (not 100% sure on the date range). \n\nWhile the climate has changed a lot (I'm not aware of any pushback to the theological introductions to the Book of Mormon), I wouldn't be surprised if that history factors into things.\n\nEdit: Eugene England wasn't a religion professor, though he certainly wrote about religion.",

Hugh Nibley published an article about it at some point, but I think it's in an obscure print source that isn't digitized.  \n\nIt seems like the theologians either raise questions about tradition or meaning reserved for church leaders in Mormonism, and they're either nudged aside or ignored by members, lay clergy, and church leaders.  Theologians don't serve much purpose particularly to hardliners in positions of authority and serve on BYU's Board of Trustees.",

Theology gets a bad reputation from Latter-day Saint scholars that point their proverbial muskets at the Church and its leaders, to borrow Elder Holland's and President Oaks' phrase.\n\nTo use scriptural language:\n\n\"O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.\"\r  \n\r  \nYes, there is danger in academic theology, but that verse is followed up with:\n\n\"But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God\" (2 Nephi 9:28-29).\n\nAlso, thinking critically about religion is not the same as being critical of religion. We need to have an inquiring mindset, otherwise we never learn anything.",

Bad men called as Bishops are in a position to cause so much damage to vulnerable members of their congregations,  and good men out of their depths are, too.  Paid local clergy (with background checks) is definitely a much healthier system than the current one.\n2.  Sanderson's Cosmere has a deeper lore than Mormon theology.  With how often teachings/books/prophets' entire contributions are silently ret-conned it's practically impossible to know what is and is not canon.  Throw in the historical gaslighting and the fact that careful scrutiny of all of Smith's major works reveals them to be fraudulent and there is literally nothing left to let people study.",

                    "comment": "I respectfully disagree on both fronts. It's a gross overconfidence to suggest that a professional clergy would be any better in regards to vulnerable members. Yes, untrained men make mistakes, and yes, I am always in favor of more training for local clergy, however we shouldn't lump the good with the bad and say the whole system is subpar due to a relative minority of bad actors. \n\nSecondly, Latter-day Saint theology is exceptionally nuanced and complex. Even from a non-believing point of view, it is very deep.  There hasn't been a single prophet's \"entire contribution\" that has been retconned. Granted, certain practices and principles have been changed, i.e. plural marriage, blood atonement, blacks and the priesthood, etc., but that is a far cry from entire massive theological contributions being ignored. While Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote a couple things in his book, Mormon Doctrine, that are against the canon, throwing the baby with the bathwater and saying the whole thing's is useless is not true. To your point of what is and is not canon, it's fairly simple. In order of trustworthiness: Restoration scripture, Church publicized writings/speeches of the prophets and apostles (the Journal of Discourses, Elder McConkie's works, and many of the statements of Joseph Smith don't make the cut here), and lastly  the Bible. While other Gospel books and historical statements of Joseph Smith are helpful, they are not necessarily canon and is therefore room to disagree on certain matters of doctrine, hence a study of theology.",

                            "comment": "1. I actually appreciate your point here.  Simply trying to find the safest individuals to be in a position that is so inherently dangerous is not enough.  Background checks, while an enormous step up from simply \"I prayed, felt like he was a good fit, asked if anyone thought he shouldn't have the position and called it a day\", are still not enough. \n\nThere are many factors that make local LDS leaders so dangerous to the congregation members.  Sexually explicit conversations between minors and adult clergy are, by definition, acts of grooming.  Bishops (and other leaders when their lesson books tell them to do so) are therefore required by the LDS church to engage in grooming behaviors.  Interviewing a minor to determine whether they are \"worthy\" is abusive.  The rhetoric surrounding church leaders is also deeply problematic.  Members have been told explicitly not to question church leaders and to give them the benefit of the doubt and to follow their counsel even if they think said counsel is wrong.  This creates a large power differential and makes setting boundaries or holding a clergy member very frightening.  Ecclesiastical leaders should also be taught not to give counselling on matters for which they are not licensed to give counselling (sharing personal opinions is fine as long as it is clear that is an unprofessional opinion).\n\nBack to the topic of professional training:  this might lend theological credence to an organization so utterly destitute of the same.  I'm not sure what can actually be salvaged,  but that's probably the only way to find out.  Paying those clergy for all the planning, studying, and preaching just seems like the right thing to do.\n\n2. Nearly everything taught by Joseph Smith and Brigham Young has been disregarded.  Men becoming gods (as first introduced during the King Folett Sermon) was publicly denied by Hinckley.  Joseph's claim of the BoM as a literal history has been quietly disregarded, and his claim to have literally translated the Book of Abraham from Abraham's own writing on a papyrus has as well.  Joseph's writings were held in such little regard that at least one version of the First Vision was hidden away in a private vault by a later prophet because the prevailing narrative was so thin it would not survive.  \n\nYoung's doctrinal contributions such as Adam-God theory, blood atonement, dark-skinned people as the descendents of Cain and being prohibited from any office other than servant in heaven, just to name a few, have similarly been retconned.  Even things that seem trivial like PR campaigns and the name members call themselves got retconned the first conference with Nelson at the helm.  The puddle that is left isn't even worth exploring further when it could easily get swept away by the next few prophets as they attempt to make a mark and hold onto the rapidly declining membership.",

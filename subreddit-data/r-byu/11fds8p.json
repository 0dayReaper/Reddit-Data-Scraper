    "postText": "I guess I need some help or advice. I applied for my majors study abroad right around Christmas and got accepted. A few weeks later the luster wore off and cost set in and I decided I\u2019d rather do an internship this summer. Right when you get accepted they charge you $1500. I cancelled my study abroad before these charges were due but they didn\u2019t take thar $1500 off of my financial center. I emailed them and they said I have to email for an appeal. I emailed for an appeal and they took $500 off but now I\u2019m stuck with the $1000. I\u2019ve emailed them several times and nobody ever responds. Am I just screwed and stuck with these charges? Anyone have any advice or connections that could help me out? I\u2019d rather not pay $1000 for a trip I didn\u2019t go on and cancelled before the due dates. Thanks for your help!",

And they turn others down then people back out and it causes a lot of problems for the trip logistics so they really want to minimize cancellations. My guess you won\u2019t be able to get it all back.",

Energy drinks are brutal on your heart in the long-term and coffee is healthier than them anyway, so since I don\u2019t drink coffee I just try to get enough sleep at night and sleep in cycle increments (any amount divisible by 1.5 hours). Sleeping in increments of 1.5 hours seriously reduces your likelihood of waking up fatigued and feeling tired throughout the day. \n\nI know some BYU students who drink V8 energizers, which are *technically* against the WoW because they have green tea extract in them, but I seriously don\u2019t judge nor do I care what people put in their bodies; it\u2019s probably healthier than an energy drink anyway. I imagine some students drink coffee as well because they aren\u2019t really concerned about that aspect of the WoW. Different strokes for different folks. \n\nIf you don\u2019t create a reliance upon caffeine for your body, you\u2019ll be able to sustain yourself without it eventually. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at in college, thankfully, but for those who aren\u2019t, energy drinks (Monsters or Redbulls seem to be popular) or green tea extract-based drinks are the way to go.",

That, however, is not sustainable for a long period of time in a daily basis. This school year has been better because I've made some life changes. For example, I would only watch tv (Netflix, Hulu, etc) as my last thing of the day if only and just only had the extra time. That means I would not watch anything if I had other things like homework or studying instead. \n\nAlso, I would prioritize my sleep schedule over social events. That means I would turn down or shorten time with friends doing social stuff if that means I have to sleep less. That does not mean I would not hang out with them, but I would prioritize me and my sleep. Finally, I started to eat healthier. I know it is way easier just to grab Chick-fil-A at the Wilk for lunch or McDonald's for dinner. However, eating healthier gave me more natural energy. That does not mean I stopped eating fast food, but I reduced my intake of fast food through the week. \n\nAll of what I mentioned will not prevent from having an all nighter or a very demanding and draining day every now and then. But I can say I personally feel with more natural energy. I haven't taken an energy drink in months. I still would drink it, but as a last resort. You know, college is going to be exhausting no matter what. So you are not alone at least.",

There are cultures where the average person expends much more energy working and work more hours than we do, and use no caffeine or other things to artificially keep them awake. \n\nIt's not that crazy to not get a lot of sleep for a couple of days, eventually your body figures it out or you take a nap.

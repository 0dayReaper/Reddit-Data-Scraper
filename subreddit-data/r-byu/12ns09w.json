BYU is my top school that I\u2019m considering transferring to. I\u2019m not Mormon and I know the tuition difference but would be willing to convert, is that possible? I\u2019m kinda just looking for a better quality of life. Kind of a broad question but does anyone have any thoughts or opinions?",

The idea behind the tuition difference is that church members contribute 10% of their income to the church, so it's similar to in-state tuition. Converting for lower tuition is probably not a good idea as church is a high-demand faith, not just a \"show up on Sunday\" faith.",

Any sexual relations whatsoever outside of marriage, even with an otherwise committed partner, can get you kicked out of school. If you\u2019re a man you can\u2019t have facial hair. Even a 5 o\u2019clock shadow will get you turned away from the testing center. No growing your hair out if you\u2019re a man. No coffee either (all the energy drinks you want though). If a roommate or whatever catches you masturbating, you could be kicked out. If you are LGBTQ this will be an extremely unfriendly place, as even holding hands with someone of the same gender can get you in trouble. I could go on. \n\nIf you take the missionary discussions as has been suggested, I would seriously take your time before converting. You seem like you might value religion in general and might be \u201cshopping around\u201d for a good fit. In Mormonism you commit to more than most churches. So much time and money will be donated to the church. You also have to believe, or at least say you believe, some pretty wild stuff beyond mainstream Christianity. Look into everything the missionaries teach you, and then look into everything they don\u2019t want you to explore also. The church has an extremely complicated and messy history that they have not been transparent about. The missionaries are trained to only tell you about the lovey dovey stuff and may not even know everything they should. \n\nHonestly going to BYU for a year or so would be a great way to familiarize yourself with the culture as well as the doctrine to see if it\u2019s something you really want to be part of after school. And being a non Mormon at BYU always scores you points for being interesting. \n\nFull disclaimer, I had a largely terrible time at BYU and ended up leaving the church a few years later. I still value my education and cheer for the sports teams though lol.",

I am so used to a life full of alcoholism and going to a college full of drugs and even sexual assault and I\u2019m pretty much done with it. Going somewhere that I don\u2019t have to worry about all that nonsense seems like paradise, even if it means I can\u2019t drink coffee or let my hair grow out. The honor code actually is something that makes the college more appealing to me, I like having structure. \n\nAs for religion, I was looking into LDS before I looked at BYU. I honestly wasn\u2019t shopping around for a new religion. I grew up Catholic so I know all about my church having a bad history. I\u2019ve been going to a Christian church for a few years now and I love it, I just don\u2019t really feel like I have a real purpose in that church though. I always looked at Mormons as \u201ccrazy\u201d because that\u2019s just what I\u2019ve always been told. Having found out some absolutely amazing people I know are Mormon, I started looking into it more. Some things are a little off-putting but honestly I just kind of felt attracted immediately, like I belong. With that being said, I talked to a missionary on the phone for a while the other day and will be meeting with a few this week. I plan to explore my options with this, but I really am just loving the idea of it. \n\nFor the past couple months I\u2019ve been feeling trapped in the area that I\u2019m in. I\u2019m still in my hometown and honestly I just can\u2019t take it anymore. It\u2019s a lovely place to grow up but I\u2019ve known since I was a child that this isn\u2019t a place for me. BYU feels like a place I can go to grow as a person and create connections that just aren\u2019t easy to find here. I\u2019ve already transferred schools before (community college to my current school), so if I\u2019m transferring again I want it to be a place where I feel like I matter. I\u2019m well aware that if I jump into this, I could regret it. But honestly, there\u2019s only one way to know. I\u2019ve had a lot of people reach out to me and mostly everyone is very welcoming and supports the idea of transferring to BYU, which is a much better community than I\u2019m in now.",

Last year he was struggling a bit with one of his professors but I think you\u2019d find that at pretty much any college. \n\nA bit of advice though, considering you\u2019re not currently a member and would be considering joining the church- do your research from sources outside of the church itself to decide if the church will actually be the right fit for you. Talking to missionaries is great, they will provide you with a lot of the general church policies and beliefs, but seeing as they\u2019re missionaries, their primary goal of going to be to convert you- whether people like to admit it or not, sometimes that means not telling the whole story with the church. \n\nI\u2019ve heard of people who aren\u2019t a part of the church who have had great experiences at BYU, but I\u2019ve also heard more of people who aren\u2019t members going to BYU and being miserable because of how intertwined the rules are with church policies and feeling isolated given they\u2019re one of the few people who aren\u2019t LDS. Ultimately, you don\u2019t need to be a member to go to BYU, but I think people who are tend to have better experiences, so I\u2019d definitely take that into consideration both with your religious beliefs and when considering attending.\n\nEdit: formatting",

And rest assured, the other students are watching and are prepared to report you for the smallest transgression. You will be under constant pressure to convert and treated as an outsider if you don\u2019t. If you\u2019re a straight female, young Mormon men will date, and even sleep with you, but will not marry you. If you\u2019re a straight male, the Mormon girls will not date you because you\u2019re unrighteous. If you\u2019re ANY flavor besides straight, cis, and white, you will be distrusted, even hated. And if you converted, will be taught TO hate and distrust those that are not straight, cis, white, AND Mormon. That includes your family and friends that aren\u2019t Mormon causing strain and alienation in those relationships, even ending them.\nIf you converted, you would be selling your soul for an education. Then they would come for your money and your time. Then, a wife and baby or two later, you find out that the \u201chistory\u201d on which the church is based is a complete fabrication and that the founder they revere was a grooming grifter and your life falls apart. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nI do hope you find what you need to be successful without having to go down this path.",

The byu students are dating to marry. I think even as a convert you\u2019ll be viewed somewhat as a second-class citizen from a dating eligibility perspective because you won\u2019t have a mission and because you\u2019re the only person in your family who is Mormon. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to dissuade you from any course of action.

The dating scene at BYU is robust, and most people are dating with the purpose of finding a spouse. A prohibition on sex prior to marriage seems to be very motivating to get the young people to marry. \n\nI would view it as you'll be new to Mormonism and you'll be \"competing\" against people who have a long-established track record of Mormon pedigree. They will have checked the right boxes to meet the requirements of progressing in the dating pool. \n\nI loved my undergraduate experience at BYU. However, I've left the Mormon faith since graduating. Once I learned about the Church's problematic history and doctrines, I could no longer believe in the Church. \n\nMost recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission fined the church $5 million for lying about its $40 billion in stock holdings. The presidents of the church for the past 20 years were complicit in the deceit. Seeing the deceit with money is a little less abstract than all the history and doctrinal issues. \n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2023/34-96951.pdf\n\nMormonism works great for a lot of people; it worked for me for a long time. Once I really dug into it, I came to the conclusion that the Mormon Church was not what it claimed to be. \n\nYou don't need to join to attend BYU. If you intend on joining, you should definitely go into it with your eyes open. One good way to learn about the actual worship experience is to read the church's official operating manual. You'll learn far more by reading this book than you will from the missionaries. \n\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/title-page?lang=eng\n\nBest of luck as you contemplate BYU and church membership.",

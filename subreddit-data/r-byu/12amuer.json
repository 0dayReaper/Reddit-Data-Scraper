You\u2019ll be required to request one if you\u2019re planning to work on campus. Also, in case you\u2019re trying to open a bank account, most of them require you to have a SSN/ITIN. So, getting a SSN is generally good. Is there a reason why you\u2019re opting out on getting one?",

You won\u2019t get in trouble for opting out, but you will get in trouble for working without a SSN.",

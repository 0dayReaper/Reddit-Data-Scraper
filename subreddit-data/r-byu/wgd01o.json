    "postText": "Has anyone taken American Heritage through the Independent Study program? I messed up by not taking it early on and am now starting the Accounting Jr Core and pursuing a MAcc, with 10 more Gen Ed credits to complete. I\u2019m terrified of American Heritage as I lived outside the US my whole life and know absolutely nothing about American history. Having a year to work on it sounds a lot more doable in my mind but idk if that\u2019s a bad idea. Would anyone recommend just taking the actual class over independent study..?",

Unless I'm forgetting something there was just a small paper (just a couple hundred words IIRC) I had to write for each chapter and the final test and that was it.",

Classes/professors that they enjoyed or weren't overly writing heavy? \n\nI am open to a writing-heavy class (as long as the topic is interesting) but writing is not my strong suit.",

He used the show The Good Place as part of his ciricumlum and had writing topics that where easy to discuss and talked a lot about them in class. IDK if the class is still going though because after my class he went to Oxford to be a visiting professor for a semester. But if it is it was the literal best. 100% endorse watching TV for homework.",

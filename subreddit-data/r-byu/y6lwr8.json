    "postText": "I need to get a Civ 1 and Physical Science credit next semester. I already have an astronomy credit I transferred from the University of Utah so I could take a chemistry or geology class to finish the physical science credit. \n\nWhat are some easy/good classes I could take to earn these GE's? Any favorite professors? Obviously if you've done this recently I would really appreciate your input.\n\nCheers! Thanks!",

            "comment": "I took two classes to make up for the Physical Science credit because I always hated science classes growing up. Last semester I took PHSCS 167--Descriptive Acoustics of Music and Speech and I'm currently in GEOL 105--Diamonds and Gems. I've really enjoyed both of them. I don't recall the physics class being too difficult. It was split into three units focused on speech, music, and electronic music (I think). I struggled more with the speech sections because I don't know mouth/ear anatomy super well but found the music section a lot easier because of my background. Regardless, I don't recall it being too difficult, Professor Neilson was great, and I found it genuinely interesting. I am also greatly enjoying the Diamonds and Gems class with Keryn Ross. Sometimes the readings are long, but the homework is just a LS quiz every day, and those and the tests are open book. You do have to allocate extra time during the week to do the lab (the lab hour is just for instructions on how to do the lab), and sometimes they take a few hours, but usually I don't mind because I think it's really interesting. In both of these classes, I was able to do really cool things I wouldn't otherwise have, like going in an anechoic chamber, appraising a diamond, and collecting my own sapphires!",

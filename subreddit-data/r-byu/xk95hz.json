He was flirting with another worker there and got distracted.\n\nAlso \"fedex lost my sample\" like 3 times in a row. And they lost all my paperwork a couple months back so I had to do a physical and all the questionnaires all over again.\n\nI like the pay but im done with the incompetence and lack of professionalism",

    "postText": "Taking 116 this Fall, I\u2019ve been told this class essentially gives you multiple attempts to test out of the class in order to receive the calc credit. If anyone has taken this, can you speak to how difficult it is / how much time you spent on the class maybe on a weekly basis? Haven\u2019t taken a math class in quite some time so I\u2019m not entirely sure what to expect, thanks!",

Honestly it wasn\u2019t much help, but I guess a certain degree of accountability to refresh some basic Calc. You can take the test every week if you want. Once you pass it, you\u2019re done. You can go to class as much or as little as you want, and all homework is optional. It\u2019s basically just the infrastructure/resources to refresh Calc",

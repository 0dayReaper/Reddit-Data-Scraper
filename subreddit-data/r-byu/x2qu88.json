            "comment": "Finite mathematics isn't super hard at all. I took it my first semester at BYU as a credit filler. \n\nhttps://math.byu.edu/wiki/index.php/Math_118:_Finite_Mathematics\n\nIt's math, so you have to apply yourself but the concepts really aren't hard at all.\n\nSet theory - basically venn diagrams. {1,2,3} and {1,4,5} what elements are the same? What do you get if you combine and only keep unique elements? Etc.\n\nCombinatorics/probability- you have 5 blue socks, 4 red socks, 3 white socks. what is the probability that if you draw 2 at random, they match? etc\n\nSystems of linear equations - row reducing, matrices, etc. Basic algebra\n\nMarkov chain - hardest concept, but they do tons of examples.\n\nThe class goes decently slow, and the homework isn't too hard so you pick it all up pretty easy if you just study a couple hours a week.\n\nIf you're doing calc 1 and survive, math 112 is extremely manageable.",

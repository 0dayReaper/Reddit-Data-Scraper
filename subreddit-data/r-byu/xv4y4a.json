            "comment": "I took it from Pope in 2017. American Heritage imo really is not that bad unless you struggle at basic US history, government, or econ. If you took any of those classes in high school, especially if they were AP classes, most of the class will be review. Workload is also manageable. Sure, there is busy work, but you're going to get similar workloads in a lot of other classes too (Chem 105 or just about any math department course comes to mind). \n\nI think it has the reputation it has because it's typically a freshman course and students are adjusting to college course life. If you have a decent work ethic and the ability to CRTL+F your way through Learning Suite reading quizzes (pro tip: get online textbooks), you will be fine. I got an A in the class taking 15 credits that semester, though I did not have a job that semester so that may have helped.",

Most people can\u2019t coast and get a decent grade like some other classes. I took it from Dr Madsen and idk how he compares to other professors but I enjoyed his lectures. \n\nI recommend also engaging in the small group labs you have once a week. It helps you learn the material and have insightful conversations even if you may disagree. I remember when we were talking about feminism and I (M) was one of the few people who said they considered themselves a feminist. Idk if people were just too scared to talk or misunderstood what feminism was but be prepared for topics that can be somewhat controversial in small groups. All our discussions were healthy but I can\u2019t say that is the same for everyone",

The tests are long and the individual questions are long as well, but as long as you understand the basis of the material and pay attention in lectures the questions are usually pretty straightforward.",

I thought it would be crazy hard because of everyone talking about how hard it is, but it really isn\u2019t bad if you actually read the assigned readings. I didn\u2019t get the chance to go to the TA review rooms, so I studied for 2ish hours and got a B+ on the first midterm. If you took APUSH, you should already know a lot of the material being covered, so if you think you can put in an hour, two at the most for the readings each week, you should be good",

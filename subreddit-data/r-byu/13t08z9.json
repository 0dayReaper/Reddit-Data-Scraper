    "postText": "Hello Everyone! I am transferring to BYU as a junior from my university in California next fall. I am excited, but feeling overwhelmed by the transfer process. I haven't connected with anyone who has gone through transferring, so, any tips/regrets/experiences/struggles/successes you've had as a transfer student that might help to figure everything out -- please drop em' \n\nMostly just looking for some insight. The good, the bad, and life in Provo. Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Though I can't really offer any insights into transferring into BYU since I haven't done that, I can offer some tips for attending BYU and living in Provo. \n\n1) Use RateMyProfessor when you're looking at professors for specific classes (this will save your life).\n\n2) I don't know how academically difficult the university you're transferring from was, but many transfer students take a little bit of time acclimating to the more academically difficult climate at BYU, so don't overload your first semester with a ton of classes if you can afford it.\n\n3) If you're a sports fan, definitely buy a BYU ROC pass. At $150 to get you into any and all sports events the entire year, it's a crazy good value.\n\n4) Consider joining some clubs to meet other people who share some of your interests. BYU has a ton of great ones.\n\nHope you enjoy BYU! Welcome!",

Unfortunately, I just might have to load up on credits to avoid being set back a semester or two due to program prereqs and religion classes. I took institute classes outside my university which will help, but I'm not close to done. I will definitely look into clubs and the ROC pass -- sounds like a great value!",

            "comment": "I transferred from University of Florida and I thought BYU was a bit easier than UF. They didn\u2019t accept some courses so I got set back a year. It kinda just happens with all transfers so you just gotta accept it. Take religion courses in spring and find easy professors. Anthony Sweat for Foundations was easy. Duncan for Eternal Families. Devon Cook for BoM and NT. You can take up to 2 per semester. Also not sure how many credits you are transferring with, but if it\u2019s at a certain amount, you\u2019ll only have to take the main 4 religions (8 credits total versus 12 or whatever it is). \nI\u2019d also say get a fun campus job. You become real good friends with your coworkers. Oh and meet with an advisor ASAP to talk about applying to your program",

I have accepted that I'll be set back a semester or two, but hoping it'll just be one! Getting into your program seems to be quite the obstacle course so far. Builds character I guess!",

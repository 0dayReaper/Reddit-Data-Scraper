Watch the intro video on ps100.byu.edu\n\n2. Read the chapter in the textbook skimming over parts that I was familiar with\n\n3. Watch the TA review video on the website\n\n4. Take the practice questions on the website\n\n5. Mark any questions I got wrong and review later\n\nI ended with a 95/100 on the exemption exam this last year with no prior experience in advanced Physics or Chemistry\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions!",

As I said in my post I\u2019m trying to just graduate at the end of the year so I haven\u2019t done high school science stuff in like 4-5 years.\n\nWhat\u2019s the textbook I should get and how long did the test take you? Did you spend like a week studying or more?",

    "postText": "Were the notes provided by the StudyForge program or whatever program provides the guided video notes actually helpful? Did you refer back to them for studying for finals, etc? Or, did you just take your own notes? I'm stuck between deciding whether or not to use the notes (which to me seem kinda bare bones) or whether to do the more laborious process of taking my own notes. I guess this also applies to other math classes with similar arrangements. \n\nAlso, are the videos that BYU independent study math courses provide enough to get an A on finals/quizzes, or are outsides sources usually required? \n\nThanks in advance for responding.",

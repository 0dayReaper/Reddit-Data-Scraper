That's what \"novel\" means. It's new, people are still studying and learning about it, and guess what? We know a lot more about it now than we did back in February! Can you imagine? Does that make sense to you? I am so sick of hearing idiots like you pretending to care what experts said back in February. If you cared about what they said in February, you'd care what they were saying now, and you would listen to them.\n\nShort answer: They weren't sure how effective masks were at slowing the spread of the virus, and public was panicking and buying up toilet paper and masks, even literally stealing masks from hospitals. Based on what was known at the time, the best thing to do was to let the doctors and nurses who needed the masks most be able to have them, by telling the general public they didn't need them.",

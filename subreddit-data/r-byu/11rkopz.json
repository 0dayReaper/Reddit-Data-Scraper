    "postText": "So I am taking an Asian Studies major and the site for my major's requirements was down for a week or so before popping back up with the new message at the top that says\n\n\"*Courses cannot be double counted between the different requirement sections in the major.* \"\n\nand now two of the sections with classes listed in the electives for the major dictate below them that they cannot be double counted as an elective. I am graduating next year and already have all of my classes scheduled in a graduation plan, done with several different advisors, that involves double-counting credits from those sections to electives. Am I screwed for graduation?\n\nI've met with the program director before because I will need to take two of my classes alongside the classes that are requirements for it, and he said that he was fine with approving that. Do you think they will waive this considering I'm already so close to graduation. I'm currently a senior with one year left. Due to dwindling financials I have to graduate next year no matter what. I plan on meeting him, but is there any precedent for major requirements changing in the middle of your major? This might be irrelevant but I will also be going on a study abroad with 3 classes to Tokyo, only 1 of which is listed on the electives. Should I see if I can count those as outside electives/do they do that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: I just noticed the bottom of the page says,  \"If approved beforehand, up to 9 hours of 330R or 399R credit may be counted for overseas work done under one of the following: Study Abroad, internships, mentored research, or independent field studies.\" However the electives requirement requires 6 classes, not a certain number of hours. Idk why it says hours then if I will only get 1-2 elective requirement classes worth.",

            "comment": "I believe that the major requirements that are in place when you begin the major are the ones that you will follow through until graduation. I worked in the Dean\u2019s Office of Engineering for several years and did quite a bit with curriculum changes. Any changes made would not affect students currently in a program, only students beginning that semester forward.",

If the one you go to isn\u2019t helpful then ask for a different one (usually colleges have multiple with a few exceptions). They are there to help! I\u2019m graduating this semester and my counselor and I are on first name basis, and I recommend her to everyone I talk to. (Physical and mathematical sciences. Brooke! You\u2019re the bomb!!!!!)",

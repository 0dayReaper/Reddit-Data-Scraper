Because of that, American culture (usually) is okay with people saying no to invitations. One thing that is sometimes said is \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d \n\nMost of the things that are considered bad in Mormonism will be explained in the BYU Honor Code. There are rules there on how to dress, and some things not to drink (alcohol, coffee, tea, edit: green and black tea, other kinds of tea are called herbal tea, and they are okay to drink at BYU) and other rules. If you follow the Honor Code, you won\u2019t have any big problems with Mormon culture. \n\nPeople will try to get you to convert to Mormonism while you study with BYU. Please make sure that if you do convert, you\u2019re doing it because you want to do it and not because someone else wants you to. \n\nGood luck in your studies. I went to South Korea for my LDS mission, and English and Korean are very different, which can make English hard for Korean speakers. Hopefully you\u2019re able to learn to speak English at the level you want/need to.",

What we learned about culture, we picked up in a word of mouth kind of way. \n\nWe were told that when we gave commitments, we shouldn\u2019t use the phrasing that corresponds best to \u201cplease\u201d in English, because what that phrasing really means in Korean is \u201cWill you do this for me?\u201d and they weren\u2019t okay with us asking investigators to do things \u201cfor us.\u201d \n\nObviously there is a financial incentive to join the LDS church when going to BYU. I don\u2019t think anybody who joined for the money would have told me that that\u2019s what they did at the time though. I was a believer at the time, and I would have been unhappy to hear about someone joining without really being committed. \n\nThinking about the situation though, I wonder if the Honor Code would force an ELC student into church services of some kind. I think it might. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s not a matter of being rude, but of being able to continue studying in the first place.",

Years ago, BYU (specifically a few departments in the WILK) had issues with some students from a certain country who used this financial benefit to get baptized and get retroactively reimbursed for the non-member tuition they paid. BYU admins eventually caught on and had to talk to them individually.",

In Japan for example, the use of matcha in cooking is seen as consuming tea and members are discourage from doing that. Ultimately you'll have to decide what you'll want to do about flavored foods. There is nothing strict about those foods in BYUs rules only regarding the drinks. So if you had some snacks that were those flavors and you kept them at home you'd likely be fine but stopping by starbucks and bringing your latte to class would definitely draw attention.",

This could be a good way for her to get in.\n\nI'm mildly bitter because their acceptance seems random to me. She has friends who were accepted with much lower academics, extracurriculars and whatnot, and she didn't get in. Some families seem to have everyone get accepted, generationally, while barely clearing the hurdles to get in.\n\nAnyway, thank you for this information. It is very helpful.",

I know he stayed on campus for a couple years and didn't really have any issues, but I'm not sure if that was in a particular dorm or not.",

You'll go into BYU with way less required general classes and can start adjusting to the college style. It'll save you a lot of money too.\n\nGoing to an out of state public school is going to put you in a lot of debt, and massive amounts of debt just aren't worth it for a bachelor's. \n\nYou say you want to ski, and I suspect you want a new environment as well. I'd say try moving into a rental and do community college.",

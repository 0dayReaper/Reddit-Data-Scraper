The professors have a lot of discretion in how they teach a course, so I would say find the easier professors and take whatever they\u2019re teaching.",

Having a degree is much more important than what field it is in, especially if you took a variety of classes. Not to mention a Spanish degree can actually lead to a lot of extra options in jobs and open up doors just by proving you know Spanish.",

Other professors I recommend are Gina Villalobos (an angel). Look for easy professors more than easy classes. The Spanish conversation classes are great but they are daily for a term, and idk if they\u2019d count for you.",

No bowling alleys in that great and spacious building for you to enjoy?\n\n&gt; Confrontive, except of themselves, of course, they leave the Church, but they cannot leave the Church alone (Ensign, Nov. 1980, 14). Like the throng on the ramparts of the \u201cgreat and spacious building,\u201d they are intensely and busily preoccupied, pointing fingers of scorn at the steadfast iron-rodders (1\u00a0Ne. 8:26\u201328, 33). Considering their ceaseless preoccupation, one wonders, Is there no diversionary activity available to them, especially in such a large building\ufeff\u2014like a bowling alley? Perhaps in their mockings and beneath the stir are repressed doubts of their doubts.\n\n\u201cBecometh As a Child\u201d\n\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1996/04/becometh-as-a-child?id=p10&amp;lang=eng#p10",

As an education major, there are few things worse than a poorly trained teacher. Expertise in a field does not equate to skills to teach that subject. We\u2019ve all had college professors that are example of that. Please strongly consider getting a teaching degree in History or English if that\u2019s what you want to pursue. An education degree is still widely applicable to many careers besides teaching and you may be surprise by how enjoyable it can be!",

That said, if you do not get an ed degree then you will need to do extra work after graduation to get a teaching certificate; you should look into the requirements for that. In addition, there isn\u2019t exactly a huge shortage of teachers that can teach English, History, and Creative Writing, so you may have some trouble getting a job when competing for it against other people with ed degrees. It\u2019s not like STEM subjects where schools are so desperate they\u2019ll take anyone who knows how.",

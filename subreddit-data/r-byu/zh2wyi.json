    "postText": "Hey everyone! I am about to complete my first semester at BYU and wanted to know how to apply for positions as a TA or tutor. Admittedly, I just completed intro-level classes (ECON 110, MATH 112, and CS 110), so I imagine positions for these classes must be (nearly) full. I've tried to look for openings on the YJobs website, but there are only a handful of positions for other courses listed. Does anyone know if that is all there is or if these positions are applied to through other means? If so, how to apply for them?",

            "comment": "In my experience, most TA positions come from professors themselves and don't start popping up until you're in your junior year or later. There might be some tutor positions within specific departments that you could apply for, but usually they like you to have at least a few years of the coursework under your belt. Best way to get one is probably be a good student and let your professors know that being a TA is something you're interested in. It might take a while, but someone will probably reach out",

There probably aren't a ton of openings right now as alot of people would keep their TA jobs for the whole year, but there will probably be more openings for Fall semester. Regardless just ask your TA or professor about how to become a TA and they will likely tell you how to apply, the process varies department by department.",

Applying online mostly just says you're interested in TA-ing for a class. CS 110 is probably full on TAs, but if you take more CS courses, the next course up from 110 and 111 (CS 235) is when professors start getting desperate for TAs. The desperation grows the farther you get in the courses",

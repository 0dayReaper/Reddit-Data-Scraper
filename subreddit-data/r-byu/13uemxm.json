    "postText": "I'm a CS Data Science major and I wanted to take either STAT 220 - Statistical Modeling for Data Science, or STAT 230 - Statistical Modeling 1. It seems like 220 is a new course and isn't required for the CS Data Science or STAT Data Science emphasis, so I'm questioning how useful it would be, but it does look like it's in Python while 230 is in R and SAS (I'd prefer Python 100%). Idk if it matters but I'd be taking CS 180 at the same time. I also want to take STAT 386 but not sure if I should do it now or after these classes. Thanks for the advice.",

It used to be called that and then they just changed the name. \n\nI was not a data science emphasis but my guess is that stat 220 will go over more modeling than just ANOVA, and be in a more useful language than SAS or R (they did 230 in R when I did it but it could be in SAS now idk) \n\n386, while I didn\u2019t take it, I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s great. Del Scott is the man to talk to about this in the department, reach out to him and while he\u2019s very old he\u2019s very knowledgeable and wanting to help students succeed and knows data science inside and out.",

In your case, get a stats minor and you will be much more competent and employable by the time you graduate.\n\nAlso you will get pretty much no exposure to SAS at BYU unless you take a bioinformatics class. All the stats classes are either R or python and that\u2019s pretty much all you need. Stat 286 does introduce Linux and SQL which is really nice so that you can kind of know what you\u2019re doing if you ever need to do that on a job.",

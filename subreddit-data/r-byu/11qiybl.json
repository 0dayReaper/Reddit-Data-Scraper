    "postText": "Has anybody take MCOMM 320 over independent study? Is it difficult? What does the course load look like? I am taking it with Crickett Willdarsen. On rate my professor she has some pretty low scores.  I just want to make that I am making the right decision. If you have any feedback on the class or her as a teach that would be great.\n\nThanks for the feedback :)",

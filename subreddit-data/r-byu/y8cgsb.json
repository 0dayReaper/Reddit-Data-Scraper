    "postText": "So I am coming to BYU fall of 2023. I already have some credits but not enough to shave off 2 semesters. My plan is to take the prereqs to both the Accounting and Finance programs at the business school. Due to the nature of my credits I could take about 12 credits each semester (4) then apply. Or I could potentially do around 14 each semester and have one very light semester (6 credits). I am trying to decide the best course of action for this. Between the 2 programs there are 5 pre req classes I need to take. Would anyone be able to give me and insight on which of these is easier/harder. Would it be bennificial to do the hardest ones on the lighter semester? Which 2 should I take at the same time. And finally, is there any classes I should take but are not necessarily required to apply? Thanks a ton! \n\n\nClasses:\nAcc 200 \nAcc 310 \nIS 201 \nEcon 110 \nFin 201",

My Aunt, top of her class, had to take it at least THREE times before she got a A. It\u2019s one of the most failed classes at BYU for all students.\n\nAccounting is also difficult too, take ACC 200 and FIN 201. Then take some easy classes like SWELL or something, maybe an easy religion class too.\n\nEDIT: suggestions below\n\n1. Use the app \u201cRate my Professor\u201d to help pick your professors. This helps a ton.\n\n2. IS 201 can be included. Overall please just take ACC 200, FIN 201, IS 201. Include some fun classes, easy GEs and religion.",

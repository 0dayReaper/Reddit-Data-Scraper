So if you get involved with them you could get a seat there. \n\nThe other option is just walk down there with authority, nod at the guard or say you\u2019re with BYUSA and just get in. No one really cares.",

They all have pieces of papers with people\u2019s names on them so I wouldn\u2019t recommend just using the confidence trick unless you take a seat and that person happens to not show up. Unless there also happens to be no paper on the seat then that might work",

If you want to learn something super practical, stat 250 is a great class to learn programming and isn\u2019t super difficult. Also, swell classes are a great way to force yourself to exercise which makes life more fun by getting your body moving.",

Musical experience definitely helps, but is not required. I know a few people who got in with this being their first choir. It's the most fulfilling thing I've experienced in my 4+ years at BYU. Rehearsal times are 4:00-5:00 MTW, and 3:30-5:00 on Thursday.\n\nhttps://choirs.byu.edu/auditions/",

But I was wondering: I\u2019m a BYU urban planning intern, and I\u2019m focusing on the Franklin, East Bay, and Maeser areas in South Provo. If anyone lives in these areas or has any suggestions for improvements (sidewalks, front runner accessibility, traffic safety, community resources, etc etc) please let me know, or PM me. Thanks!",

As the area is ahing the older homes are being converted to multi family dwellings but you have to travel to 500 east and center or 500 north and freedom to get to the closest grocery store. There is one midsize Mexican market but there are many necessities they don\u2019t carry. \n\nI do realize sams club is in East Bay but membership stores don\u2019t tend to service low income folks and at the same time stores like dollar general only drain more money by overcharging for smaller packaging in the guise of \u201cdeals\u201d. \n\nPolicies that could make the area more walkable by bring businesses close to housing would also reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life for all of south provo.",

Most of the area south of campus is zoned [RC (Residential Conservation Zone)](https://provo.municipal.codes/Code/14.32), which means:\n&gt; if existing residential uses are replaced, new development is to be established at not more than the same density as legally existed on April 2, 2002.\n\nThat zoning prohibits building any of the \"missing middle\" housing (see: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_middle_housing) or [NotJustBikes on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCOdQsZa15o)), so the area is literally prohibited from becoming much more walkable or bikeable.\n\nIf you want to make any substantial improvements to the area, you'll need to start with zoning.",

To get to one\u2019s apartment (or pick up a friend/relative), you often have to drive an extra three blocks and wait at 2-3 lights just to make a u-turn and travel the same distance again. It blocks up the road with unnecessary traffic, and with the new dedicated UVX lane, it has created congestion where there wasn\u2019t previously any. Compound this with Provos apparent hatred of protected left arrows and love of \u201cno left turn\u201d signs, and you have the perfect conditions for maximum road rage (me).",

However, I abhor the bus lane on 700, as it literally uses 1/2 the road for a bus that only uses the lane once every 7-9 minutes.\n\nIf we had more protected lefts, people would get in less wrecks, bikes would be safer, and I\u2019d be less constantly pissed off. lol",

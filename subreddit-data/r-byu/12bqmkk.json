    "postText": "First off, before you get mad at me, yes, this is petty and stupid. There are many real problems in the world, and this is far from one of them. I am literally in the hospital for family today, so I do know what really problems are. I am still allowed to be upset for my tiny annoyance.\n\nI\u2019m graduating this year, and my final GPA will be 3.94. I have worked incredibly hard. My major is in the sciences, and I included a minor also related to my field. To top it off, I achieved this while also working and supporting my husband as he experienced multiple massive surgeries.\n\nThe cutoff for the lowest tier of Latin honors is 3.95. I have looked into every detail and crunched all the numbers, and unless a decent number of people do more poorly than expected, I will be 1/100th of a point shy of being recognized for my hard work. \nI would have gotten it had I graduated last year, which had the cutoff of 3.94.\n\nI\u2019m a little upset.",

When I moved here,  20 years  ago. our entire ward was made up of young families whose dads all worked for a  large Fortune 500 company that actively recruited from BYU. They loved that so many recruits were bilingual. They stopped recruiting 15ish years ago. The LDS hires weren\u2019t successful. There\u2019s one guy still at the company, the rest couldn\u2019t get past the level entry level positions and moved on.\nNone of my kids bothered to apply to BYU. It simply isn\u2019t well thought of where we live anymore. \n10-15 years ago, kids worried about getting in to BYU. Now it is their safety school. If you are LDS in our town and you apply to BYU, you get in. A lot of the kids who have gotten in the last 5 years are very vocal about the way feel about BYU and how POC, the LGBTQ community, and women are treated at BYU.",

My grandpa was pretty high up in a big engineering firm before he retired and always talks about how he would never let people with very high GPAs get hired unless they clearly demonstrated some kind of humility. After working in the industry for a long time, he realized that there was a pretty big correlation between very high GPAs and an inability to get along well with others, which is a huge red flag for employers. \n\nAlso, this kinda attitude will make it a lot harder for you to make friends in general. You're absolutely right that this is petty. You have peers who have \"family in the hospital\" type situations every semester of college and that often affects their GPA. I'm sure you don't mean any harm to anyone, but your entire post comes off as very privileged, egotistical, and generally just oblivious of how much harder other people's lives are than yours.\n\nEdit: downvote me all you want.

It's not wrong to feel those emotions and want to vent. And seriously, it was my point in the first place that you shouldn't have to know that her husband is facing complications to show compassion. It does not negate or improve your prior comments at all.",

This is something I worked very hard for, so I am allowed to be mildly disappointed that I didn\u2019t reach my goal. I do not emphasize my gpa to anyone, but I did want to reach this achievement. We all have goals and things we are good at, and mine just happen to be school related. Just because my gpa makes you feel inferior to the point of attacking my character does not mean I am egotistical or prideful about it.",

Your husband is *recovering* from a major surgery. I know people who have had multiple friends and family members, including siblings, die while they were in college. If you're graduating with a 3.94, I have a really hard time believing you've been through any kind of hell. I don't think having a high GPA automatically makes you a bad person, but claiming your life is hard is a massive reach.",

Bout Time in Vineyard, Strap Tank in Springville, and WingNutz in Orem are my three go to spots for this kind of thing. \n\nBout Time is the most conventional sports bar and has a decent tap selection. Strap Tank actually is a brewery, so they'll have samplers if you're into that. I think the only TVs are behind the actual bar though, and I've only ever been for dinner. WingNutz is in the University Place mall, so it will probably feel most like you're back in Provo, but they don't have the best drinks or environment. \n\nI've also heard decent things about Callie's in Orem. Then you have the list of chains like BWW, Wingers, Chili's, Applebee's, and so on that serve beer and show sports.  You probably wouldn't be the only BYU fan drinking at any of these places. DM me if you want to meet up, I live right downtown.",

                    "comment": "That\u2019s a great question, and the answer will vary from person to person. First of all, I think it\u2019s important to recognize that BYU is often the only choice some people have when it comes to a college education. There are plenty of students who are at BYU because they won\u2019t receive any financial support from their parents unless they attend a church-owned school. For me it was a combination of financial and social pressures that first lead me to BYU. I was born and raised LDS outside of the Mormon corridor, and by my senior year of high school most of my LDS friends where planning on going to BYU. I really wanted to stick with my church friends as well as live up to the ideal of being a BYU graduate which was very strong in my home ward. I also came from a very low income family, and BYU ended being one of the few options that I could afford. The problem was that I never actually believed in the truth claims of the church, and the fear of being ostracized from the only community I knew lead me to live a lie much of my adult life. Despite that challenge, I still really value my LDS upbringing and my time at BYU. My mission and church activities helped me overcome severe social anxiety and I ended up making a lot of good friends at BYU. I also received a wonderful education and now have an awesome career. Even though I find many of the policies and cultural practices at BYU to be problematic, and even harmful, I recognize that there\u2019s a lot of nuance to take into consideration. So, despite being an atheist and \u201capostate\u201d, I will always identify as a Mormon (but not LDS) and will be proud of my affiliation with BYU. I also think it\u2019s important for active members and ex-Mormons be cool with each other because both groups can learn and grow a lot from each other\u2019s experience.",

My problem is I always ended up hanging out with the strict Mormons at BYU and never had anyone admit that they were going through the motions or didn\u2019t believe in some aspects of the faith. That\u2019s why I  was always surprised to see people at Chillis cheering for BYU while drinking, but I never had the chance to talk to them.",

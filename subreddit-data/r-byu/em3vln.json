    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm a sophomore at BYU who thinks he looks way better with a beard, and my wife and friends agree. So I let my facial hair grow and shave before tests. I hate doing this, because I want to let my beard grow out, so a couple weeks ago I met with the Associate Dean of Students Nathan Ward to discuss the issue of beards.\n\nA quick summary of our meeting: that sucks, there's nothing I or you can do, have an ice cream on us.\n\nIn all honesty, my meeting with Dean Ward was very cordial and respectful. I went in knowing that people would have spoken with him before and intended on getting some ideas on official ways I can go about appealing it to people in power. And that's where I hit a brick wall. While I got the feeling throughout the meeting that Dean Ward was on my side and in total agreement, he explained to me in no uncertain terms that there's no way for me to directly contact those in charge of the Dress and Grooming Standards.\n\nHe also explained to me who's in charge of them: the First Presidency, Twelve, and a handful of other commissioners who meet to talk about the entire CES once a month. He told me that they were aware of the issues and that they were aware that student sentiment had changed. I asked if he could bring it up, he said that while they do talk about student sentiment about many rules that not even President Worthen can make recommendations on changes to the Honor Code: only the board can ask for recommendations. ie the prophet, his counselors, and 3 or 4 other people. The last time they asked for recommendations? 1991.\n\nI asked him if he could see the policy changing while I'm at BYU (two-ish more years), he said he wouldn't be surprised, but that I shouldn't hold my breath.\n\nAfter 45 minutes of discussion, I said \"it appears we've hit a brick wall.\" Dean Ward chuckled sympathetically, and as a well-intentioned final act of placation, gave me two coupons for free ice cream from Cougar Eats, which I enjoyed with my wife.\n\nEDIT: here's a follow up on my experience writing President Worthen himself:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/ex2jse/follow\\_up\\_to\\_my\\_previous\\_post\\_about\\_the\\_beard/](https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/ex2jse/follow_up_to_my_previous_post_about_the_beard/)",

When it became standardized it came under the control of the board, which happens to consist of the First Presidency and several members of the Twelve.\n\nI think that silliness is why the rule hasn\u2019t been changed. The Board meets once a month for probably an hour or so. They don\u2019t have time to talk about beards or leggings.",

I simply stated that if you are able to get one, you should do it. Literally all I suggested was that you look into it. Why tell yourself that you don\u2019t qualify instead of asking a doctor for their opinion on the matter?\n\nSecondly, \u201cdisobeying a dumb rule\u201d = not living by the honor code that you agreed to live by in order to go to BYU. BYU tuition costs are paid substantially by tithing money. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you think the rule is stupid. You\u2019re not living the honor code while still benefitting from adjusted tuition rates after tithing. The argument can absolutely be made that what you are doing is worse (than asking a doctor if you would qualify for a beard card).\n\nThere are certainly worse things you could be doing at BYU but it baffles me that you pulled the holier-than-thou card regarding looking into the beard card option while literally going against the honor code. \ud83d\ude02",

Bishop told my dad he could talk to the stake president (who I know to be a good man). The SP also sympathized with my dad but said that it wasn't his decision to make exception to policy and that he'd be stepping on the bishops toes if he reversed bishops decision anyway. \n\nMy dad hit a dead end. Neither bishop or SP were willing to take responsibility over how the decision should be made. Furthermore, my dad couldn't climb the latter of command on the issue. Needless to say, this really upset my dad. It was understandable when my brother stopped attending church after being denied priesthood meeting, priesthood ordination AND a temple recommend (despite the fact that he was worthy). Worth mentioning that bishops in wards on the other side of the valley WERE oradianing and including transgender youth. Little bro was 14 at the time, and trying really hard to be a good member.",

You're told what to wear, how to wear your hair and beard, with whom you may live, where you may live, activities in which you may take part, etc. Of course, nearly every student endorses these strict rules to attend the Y.   \n\n\nI was involved in the Social Club scene in the early 80's at the Y and being part of a fraternity was one of the most positive experiences I remember from the Y.  Our 'club' was founded at the Y in 1917 and, in fact, two current Apostles were members when they attended BYU. In 2017, we celebrated our 100 year anniversary with a dinner and conference during Homecoming with several hundred members in attendance. Many were well into their eighties. We even heard a few inside stories about a certain Apostle from his former roommate. But social clubs were banned from BYU in the early 90's. The reason we were told was because we didn't allow universal admittance of anyone who wanted to be a member. I suspect the real reason was because BYU couldn't fully control clubs. But, as I said above, you play by BYU's rule when you attend...for better and worse.",

I don\u2019t have access to the econ lab and I\u2019m curved with the in-person classes who have completely different resources. Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

We\u2019d have to do the homework and go to the lab.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I would have passed that class without going to the lab. Good luck. \ud83d\ude2c",

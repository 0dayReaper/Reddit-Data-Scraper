You are relying on Bishop/Dean roulette when it comes to whether or not you are in trouble for this.

Meaning that there is a group making mid 5 figures and a group making 170K+ right out of Law School (BigLaw). \n\nThere's pros and cons to each, but most people who are making &lt; 100k are doing some type of criminal defense work. Many people feel called to this type of work in a similar way to teachers or social workers. In that case it's not really fair to measure if it's \"worth it\" based on salary.\n\nPersonally, I think Law School can be very much worth it if you don't take on a lot of debt and are willing to work where you go to school. I was grinding away at a tech job in Vegas making significantly less than what a typical 1st year grad makes. I ran the numbers and it'll take me about 7 years to break even (including the 3 in school) but after that my income trajectory would be much greater.\n\nSo to each their own, but there are still lots of ways that LS can be worth it. Going to BYU for a ridiculously low tuition can help guarantee sweet outcomes.",

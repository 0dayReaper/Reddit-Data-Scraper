    "postText": "Im struggling to get through my stupid religion class because I fell into a depression and cant get myself to go on campus for that class. Its my only on campus class. Is there anyway to get the accessibility center to let me switch to an on demand version of the class instead? Its Hank Smith and he wont record lectures (i dont have any accommodations saying i need this )",

            "comment": "The accessibility center has open-ended negotiation powers and procedures. The professor also has a voice in the negotiation process. Best thing you can do is get the conversation with the accessibility people started. Second best thing you can do is get as strong as possible of a psychological staff documentation of your depression struggle. There\u2019s a mental health office in the Wilk and/or your bishop can get you an appointment with an LDS Family Services counselor. If getting on campus is a problem, these services should be willing to do Zoom or at least a phone call with you.\n\nAs someone who has been in this situation, something I would also recommend (unfortunately), is that you withdraw or at least find out when the withdraw deadline is. If you\u2019re past the tuition refund deadline, you won\u2019t get a refund, but a W on your transcript does not affect your GPA.\n\nSo sorry that you\u2019re going through this. Good luck.",

Also, I know sometimes talking to the accessibility center can take a lot of spoons, so to speak, so if you have a really close friend or roommate, you can ask them for help writing emails and such. I've researched doctors and scheduled appointments for low-spoons friends before. If it gets overwhelming, I know you'll find someone who's willing to help you &lt;3",

You can also petition to keep it even without an accommodation if you do have strong documentation. I'd recommend getting an appointment with the accessibility center and talking about it asap so maybe you can withdraw with the deadline with that accommodation in place and not have to deal with any petitions.",

    "postText": "I'm currently a senior in HS taking Calc AB online through BYU independent study, and I was wondering what would happen if I get a grade below 60%. Would they really give me a failing grade and prevent me from passing the class j bc of the final? My grade is currently high enough that I can afford to get a 40% on the final and still get a B (calculated through Rogerhub).",

Just ask the teacher, but if your grade is already that high, I\u2019m sure just with even just a very small amount of studying you\u2019ll be able to pass",

I am doing well but concerned because I think a 60% is like a 4 on the AP test. I just want to pass this class and get a grade. Did you hear anything back from BYU? I feel\nLike every time I ask a question I get highlevel vague replies.",

I think a 60% is like a 4 on the AP test. To me 60% should not equal a 4 on an AP test. I just want to pass this class and get a grade. \nThanks!",

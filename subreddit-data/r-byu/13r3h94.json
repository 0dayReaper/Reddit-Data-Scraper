If you showed a schedule like this to most students they'd probably say you were lucky even though you have a class going until 7 PM. Make sure to get your Thursday homework done before Wednesday when at all possible though.",

Classes rarely end exactly on time, I found, and the traffic getting out of the JSB is brutal. The JKB also has its share of traffic jams around the top of the hour as people run to and from classes. It also means you'll never have time to stick around and ask the professor or TA questions \n\nIt'll take a bit of dedication and self regulation to keep those off days as work days, but you seem to know yourself pretty darn well. 15 credit hours for a freshman year is very reasonable, and with the exception of that cross-campus sprint on Tuesday evening, your classes are spaced very well for some breathing room between them. Just make sure you bring a water bottle and maybe a snack (or dinner, if prof gives you a little break in the middle) for that 3 hour class, and you should be fine.",

            "comment": "This isn't an answer to your question, but I'll just say that I took Econ 110 from Platt my first semester of freshman year and it was an incredible class. He drops 1 of the 3 midterms and gives you unlimited tries on the quizzes. Econ 110 requires you to change the way you think as it is a very logic-based class, but Platt is an amazing teacher, so if you keep up with your studying and homework, you're going to have a great time in the class.\n\nI also just took Rel A 121 from Calabro this past winter semester and it was pretty good. The only homework is a weekly study journal based on the class readings and the midterms are fairly easy because he gives you a pretty comprehensive study guide. It's a very chill class and Professor Calabro is very fun and quirky.\n\nI honestly wish I could take Econ 110 again because it was such a great experience, so yeah. Might be biased because I'm a double major with Econ, but I digress. Hope that helps!",

I graduated from the IS program and 110 wasn\u2019t bad for me, but depending on if things have changed, you\u2019ll have to learn some relatively simple coding with VBA and a lot of Excel work, learning some SQL, building a website, and some basic stuff about computer hardware and terminology. Maybe easy for you, maybe not.\n\nAs for if it\u2019s good to have 2 full days and 5 days off, I can tell you from my experience this was 100% the way to go. I always tried to do my Tuesday work on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, and my Thursday stuff Thursday night and Friday morning. It left my Friday afternoons- Tuesday free, which was sooooooo nice. I\u2019d guess you\u2019re going into one of the business school majors, and it gives you such a leg up if you can get a part time job in whatever field you\u2019re looking to get into. For example, I was going into IS and I got a job as a web developer in the library that was really chill. One semester I also had a job in the Electric shop on campus and that has been suuuuch a good life skill to learn, as I\u2019ve used it incredibly frequently in my homes for the last 6 years.\n\nAnyway, the TL;DR is I loved my 2 day/week schedule as it allowed a lot of flexibility for on-campus jobs during the rest of the week.",

Go to the TA labs if you need to at least once a week for his class, he gives you practice questions that if you repeat them over and over again before the test you\u2019ll do very well if you understand the concepts. He drops quizzes, he drops a midterm, and drops a \u201cpaper\u201d. The papers are so easy and two paragraphs and I\u2019m not recommending ChatGPT but I\u2019m also not saying it won\u2019t help ;) \n\nI got an A in Platts class just by doing the practice problems over and over. \n\nReligion classes should be pass/fail but they aren\u2019t, just stay on top of the busy work and make sure you checked your professors on rate my professor. \n\nIS110 just go to class and follow along, the homework answers are given out and the midterm is easy. It really is a very useful class and the easiest class you\u2019ll take. \n\nACC200 is not bad, I\u2019m not a math guy but I got an A in it simply by taking practice tests and going to the TA lab if I had a question. It really isn\u2019t that bad, ECON is going to be your hardest class.\n\nMKTG 200 is best taken from Swenson bc you just have to memorize the powerpoint slides to get an A, but I\u2019m sure that professor won\u2019t be too bad. \n\nBest of luck",

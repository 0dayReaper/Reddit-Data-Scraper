Beards haven\u2019t been associated with drug/hippy culture for decades, and no one would correlate having facial hair and being a drunk or a vagabond, as he implies with the analogy of the empty liquor bottle and beard.",

However, during my time at BYU I kept the dress and grooming standards. It\u2019s totally reasonable for the Church to want the students of its flagship university to to be clean-cut. They represent the church and receive tithing-subsidized education. Also, then-Elder Oaks said it would not surprise him if the standards changed, not that he expected them to change. There is a difference. Finally, BYU has changed plenty of standards over the years (when my my mom attended, women were not allowed to wear pants on campus).",

I don't think anyone argues that BYU doesn't have a right to ban facial hair, people just argue about whether it's a good rule.\n\nI understand the thinking behind the beard rule, however I think the thinking is flawed. The beard rule was put in place because beards were a symbol of rebellion, and BYU has always been a very conservative school, so I get the reasoning behind the rule in the 1970s. Today, the rule is simply an arbitrary prohibition on an innocuous fashion choice.\n\nThe only current argument that could hold any weight is that some people would grow beards out of laziness and they wouldn't look good. This argument is moot, though, because the university allows mustaches which are almost universally mocked. If BYU were concerned about appearances, they would flip it; allow beards but ban mustaches. BYU also doesn't mandate that clothes be washed and properly fitted, even though that always looks bad while beards often compliment a man's look.\n\nThe bead rule also, in many people's minds, cheapens the rest of the Honor Code. The Honor Code purports to uphold the standards of the Gospel, but in talking with people not familiar with it they almost always say that the beard rule is dumb when they find out about it. Furthermore, when the Honor Code is mentioned in the media it almost always says something along the lines of: \"The school's Honor Code, which prohibits such things as modesty, premarital sex, and facial hair...\" Two of those things are eternal principles, one of those things is not. It reflects poorly on the Honor Code and can make an outsider think that the rest of the Honor Code is just an outdated set of rules from a backwards era.\n\nTo your last point (if you've made it this far), BYU has changed some standards over the years. We're pushing for one more.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk.",

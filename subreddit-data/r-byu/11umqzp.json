The activity in question should start around mid-June, but I need to have everything for it paid by mid-April, so it\u2019s be nice to hear somewhat soon. Thanks!",

Explain that you have an April deadline, and that you're not just being impatient. \n\nIf you know an Econ professor, or are currently taking an econ class, you can also ask them.",

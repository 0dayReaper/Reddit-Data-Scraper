The cs department has recently told me that cs students can now take math 290 in place of math 113. My question is, is it any better? Has anyone taken both? I just want to take the easier option.",

            "comment": "Math 113 is integral calculus and frankly the there\u2019s a decent chance the concepts in there will come up in your career if you\u2019re coding anything technical or or graphical like video game development.\n\nMath 290 is pretty much all theory. There are some new concepts, but mostly it\u2019s learning to interact with and understand Math in a deeper way such as doing proofs.\n\nBoth are difficult for very different reasons, 113 because it\u2019s new concepts, and 290 because you can\u2019t just plug and chug anymore. In my case I found 290 much easier because of my OCD-like need to understand mathematical concepts and not just know enough to use them, so 290 wasn\u2019t that big a leap for me.\n\nPersonally I would suggest you take 113; integral calculus comes up a LOT in the real world and will be a greater benefit to you as a CS guy imo.",

I think they've standardized the curriculum since I took it in 2016, so it may be easier now, but it's still the first \"real\" math class that most math majors and minors take. I took graduate-level math and physics classes my last two years of undergrad, and 290 was still the lowest grade I got at BYU.",

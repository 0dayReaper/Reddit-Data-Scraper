Also I am retaking CS 224 so I kind of know what is going on. And I might not take MATH 113 and wait until Fall semester but I am still unsure.\n\nThanks!!!\n\nPS. I didn't mean the title so just ignore the second question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y1oxj8gbuj9a1.png?width=507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f3acc9018b2e794cd26e8fa931eb042f48753e1e",

So you shouldnt go back into 224 expecting it to be easy, you'll need to put significant effort in.\n\nI never regretted taking 12 credits but I definitely regretted taking 15+.",

The reading wasn't too heavy and helps a lot with the assignments. The tests were similar questions to the assignments so if you can do all the homework problems you'll be fine on the tests. So basically just a standard class with some extra time required to do labs.",

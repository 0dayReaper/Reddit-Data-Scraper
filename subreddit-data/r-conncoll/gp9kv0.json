    "postText": "I\u2019m looking at Conn and I\u2019m interested in learning about Outcomes of students and how well they are able to get jobs in their field of study (particularly Econ). I understand that the Hale Center does a seemingly excellent job with the career intensive courses they have. Also, is there any on campus recruiting and what not from companies? How helpful is the alumni in aiding students get internships? Do employers have good impressions of Conn? I understand that it is in the NESCAC, both my brother and my sister attend/attended Midd and Hamilton respectfully, and I wonder how it stacks up against these schools. I really like Conn and I hope it maintains a similar reputation and prestige. I\u2019m also looking at Dickinson, Gettysburg, Bates and other schools. Thanks.",

    "postText": "I am posting this because I am an accepted student for the Class of 2018. I need a no-bullshit opinion of the school. I have toured there, I like all the programs, but there is a problem.\n\nI went through all the right motions, did all the paperwork, and got in.\nTuition &amp; Board for next year however is 63,000, which although astronomical is still manageable. \n\nThis is a 5000 price increase over last year. It is as expensive as Stanford, more expensive than 95% of colleges. And although I see all the good ConnColl offers, I need to make an effective case to my parents. Without giving too much away, I will be doing an overnight at ConnColl soon.\n\nThe school really appeals to me from the little that I have seen. I want to know what specifically made you sign the line. My interests are IR, Italian, Acapella, and Study-Abroad. I'm also liking the Fulbright send-off.\n\nPlease, help me understand what makes this school stellar.",

            "comment": "Hey there! I'm Oliver Ames, a freshman at the college. To give you a bit of perspective I'm involved in @tedxconncollege, @williamstweetmx (acapella), residential life, and am an astro-physics major (among other things).  I can tell you exactly why I joined Conn - the people. The bond between students at the college is something I could not find anywhere else. Simply put, I choose Conn to be with the students here, knowing what I wanted to do would come after I found those lifelong connections. Speaking of connections, Conn is the place to be. I'm about to get a meeting with Harvey Moseley, head astrophysicist at Nasa. To speak of study-abroad I cannot wait. My girlfriend just came back from Japan and she LOVED her time there. I myself hope to go to India or somewhere in South America. Hopefully I'll be able to get an internship in the science and technology field in that country. Danny did mention CELS so I'll give it a bit of a plug (for your parents). Harvard literally based their program off of ours. $3,000 is a lot of money and more than enough to get by on for a semester anywhere in the world. If you want more info though, hit me up facebook dot com slash oliverames (send me a message first)",

            "comment": "Hi there. I'm a senior at Conn right now. I mean, Im sure everyone will have a different reason for why they looked Conn, mine was partly because they gave me a lot of financial aid, but that may not be the case for you. But even more important than that for me is the CELS office here, which is career enhancing life skills. They prepare you for an internship(and give you a stipend for it if you need it) and a job after college, they basically help you plan your life, which is SO important especially for a liberal arts school where you're not on track for a particular job and not sure what you're going to do. I know some of my friends from home had to do all of it on their own and they miss out on so much information that CELS provides, like internships, programs, and research experience,  Fulbright's, and more\n\nIf you have any specific questions feel free to ask, I've been a student for awhile",

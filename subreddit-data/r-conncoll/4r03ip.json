    "postText": "Hi\nI'm looking into Conn College, and I have some questions. \n\n1. Could a Far-Right conservative survive at Conn? I hear the faculty is pretty Liberal. I want a place where EVERYONE has a chance to express their views. I don't want to be surrounded by a bunch of Social Justice Warriors. \n\n2. I hear Conn is pretty preppy( that's what I'm looking for) Since there are no frats, where do all the preppy kids hang out and party?\n\n3. What are the differences between Conn and Trinity College in Hartford?\n\nThanks ",

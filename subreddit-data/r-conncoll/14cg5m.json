    "postText": "**The following email stirred quite a bit of buzz around campus today:**\n&gt;Dear Connecticut College Seniors,\n\n&gt;After a careful review of \u201cFishbowl\u201d\u2014including consultation with staff and student leaders, recommendations from staff in the Office of Student Life and a review of complaints and concerns from students and other College staff in previous years\u2014senior administrators have made the decision to eliminate this event.\n&gt;\n&gt;We invite the members of the Class of 2013 to work together to help plan a new spring tradition, one that more accurately reflects the values of the members of your class and the College. I have discussed this with senior class leaders, and they are very excited about the prospect of creating this new event with all of you. They are planning a meeting soon to get your input; look for an invitation shortly.\n&gt;\n&gt;I look forward to hearing your ideas about a new senior tradition.\n&gt;\n&gt;Best wishes,\n&gt;Carolyn Denard, PhD\n&gt;Dean of the College\n\n**The president of SGA, Taylor Gould, posted the following from the SGA facebook account:**\n&gt;As many of you now know the decision up has been made to cancel fishbowl at the college. While I realize that this comes to a shock to many of you, this decision was made in consultation with the senior class council and myself. I encourage you not to rush to make judgments about the decision but rather to ask questions and become informed about all the factors that resulted in the decision. The 2013 Class Council and myself look forward to answering your questions and are excited about the creating a new tradition for our class and for senior classes in the future.\n&gt;\n&gt;Please feel free to email sga@conncoll.edu if you have specific questions or concerns.\n&gt;\n&gt;Sincerely,\n&gt;\n&gt;Taylor Gould '13\n&gt;SGA President\n\n\n**The [Connecticut College Student Government Association Facebook page later posted the following:](https://www.facebook.com/conncollsga/posts/424786460908832)**\n&gt;To clarify some students and alums have asked about \"consultation.\" To clarify the statement does say that the decisions was made in consultation with the senior class council and sga president. The administration had firmly made their decision and their consultation was more of a way to inform us of their decision and rationale behind it as opposed to being consulting on whether or not the decision should be made. Again, SGA will be discussing this decision tomorrow, we encourage you to come to Ernst at 7:15.",

I know there's a recording studio, which is awesome. \n\nWhat are the kinds of kids in high school that come here?\n\nWhat is your favorite and least favorite thing about the school?\n\n",

Though they all graduated with me, their concerts were always really well attended, and I doubt you'd have any problem starting up a new heavy metal band.",

    "postText": "Me(23M) and my girlfriend(24F) moved into a new place this last month. On the move in day it\u2019s lots of trips out to the car both of us just getting boxes and stuff. I decided to make the last trip for the night around 11:45PM, as I\u2019m reaching into my car I hear 6 gunshots that sounds like they are right next to me and a car screech off. I walked around the corner and the first thing I see is someone laying on their back so I saw their legs and shoes pointing up. At this point tons of people are walking out so I screamed for someone to call 911 and ran over, a woman had been shot 4 times 3 in the chest/arm and once in the face. She was barely there at that point I took my sweatshirt off and tried to cover the back of her head but it wasn\u2019t really any use and she died in my arms. It\u2019s been about a month and a half now and I still see it all the time and I hear that sound she made as she died all the time. As much as people try and be there it\u2019s hard to talk to people that I know so I just had to get this off my chest thank you.",

You\u2019re a really good person for being there for her in her last moments, not many would. Most people would stand by and do nothing but you actually made a difference in the last moments of that woman\u2019s life. \n\nIf you\u2019re finding it hard to move on from this you should definitely seek professional help. They aren\u2019t a friend and what you say is totally confidential and you have to freedom to say whatever you want.\n\nRegardless, I hope you recover from this brother, you\u2019re a strong one.",

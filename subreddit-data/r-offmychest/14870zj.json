    "postText": "(I apologize for any spelling or grammar errors as I am on my very laggy iphone)\n\nHello everyone. I 16f started dating my ex 15FTM in December of 2022. Everything was fine at first, until his true colours began to shine. He was very manipulative and narcissistic. Constantly threatening suicide and blaming me for issues that were not my fault. We broke up multiple times, the last being in April. This was because of the fact he cheated on me. This resulted in me ending up in the hospital, due to attempted suicide. While there, he sent me messages accusing me of faking my mental illnesses and overall being a horrible person. After this I made the mistake of forgiving him. He once again confessed to still having feelings for me. However, unlike the last times I rejected him. Telling him I could never see myself in a relationship with him again after all the pain he caused me. This did not go well. He accused me of playing with his feelings and using him, which I did not do. After this we cut contact, until he tried reaching out multiple times. I did not want this contact, yet he contacted through mutual friends. Months went past until a few days ago, when he began to spam me on multiple different social media platforms via different accounts. Having enough, I made the mistake of answering. He said he was moving back to town (he previously moved around march 2 hours away) and wanted to be friends. I declined, but said I did not want drama and was fine with being chill. He then managed to find out I have feelings for my friend (M17). After this, he went into a discord server and began to spread both mine and my friends personal information to online strangers. He also sent pictures of me and made up lies. Accusing me of being a cheater, making fun of my ED, my looks, just every horrible thing you could imagine. I think it was out of jealousy, as he told a friend of mine he intended to  get me back and he was confident it would happen again. I went to my parents about this, crying and panicking. They called the police as he has also made physical threats towards me, my best friend F16, my friend M17 and my male classmates. I met with the police today, and they are going to contact him and his mother. A no contact order may also be put in place but I am unsure. Is a restraining order possible? I do not want him to come back to my school or to my work and harass me in person. I guess my question is what other legal action can be taken place? I am from Ontario Canada. I don't know how I got myself into this situation at such a young age and just don't know what to do. Also yes, I have thousands of screenshots spanning back to December.\n\nTLDR: My manipulative, narcissistic and cheating ex boyfriend attempted to get me back but found out I had feelings for another. So he spread my personal information online to strangers and the police are now involved.",

    "postText": "Talking to mother has become such an anxiety inducing experience because no matter what the topic is, she'll always somehow default to a conversation about money. We struggled financially growing up but we are in a much better place than we were 5 years ago. I remember so much of my childhood was overshadowed by financial worries because we just never had enough. We never had enough for food, tuition, rent for our tiny 2 bedroom and that meant there was never a possibility of enjoying \"childhood experiences\" like even having toys. I have come such a long way in trying to develop a better mindset and relationship with money because I want to live through my adulthood with more financial freedom. Over the past 2 years, my mother who is getting close to retirement age has been overly obsessed with money and her attitude towards it, that we were raised with, has been that of constantly complaining about not having it, guilting myself and my sister (my brothers don't help at all) about it and how we spend ours and having this scarcity mentality where even when speaking in future tense, she already sees herself as bot having any, if that makes sense. \nI'm really trying to set myself up to live a different life than what I've been raised in and alot of that work is mental and emotional. I just feel like this is becoming impossible with how she is. I feel trapped in this type of mentality because bo matter how much progress I make in terms of developing a positive mindset, every end of the day(I live with her) I'm reminded of just how much she doesn't have and by extension, how much I don't have. Those feelings of shame and guilt completely take over and the anxiety overwhelms me and suddenly I'm back to my childhood days where I didn't have any toys to play with or couldn't have any new clothes and had to wear hand me downs with holes and it really makes me feel worthless. I've been treating myself monthly and every month I'm met with disapproving looks and comments, I've even started hiding take out boxes in my room and sneaking it out on trash days because I know that when she sees them, I'll be reminded of the fact that she needs money for one thing or the other. I tried buying flowers(I got the cheapest) for her that she could put in the living room to bring in some color because we don't even have pictures on the wall, and I was scolded for it and she insisted that I should have just given her the money and was wasting it on things that were not important. I haven't bought any since. \nLiving like this is so exhausting and I feel trapped in this cycle. It feels like I can't break free from it because at every turn I am reminded of how much I have never had and probably will never have.",

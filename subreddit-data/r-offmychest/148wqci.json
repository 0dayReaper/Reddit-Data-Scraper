    "postText": "Idk where to start. I am 21 but most of my life I spent trying to escape and hide from the reality, whether it's due to bullying, suicidal thoughts or god knows what. After realizing how little I understand social cues and ppl thinking I'm weird in a bad way rather than good way I decided to shut down and it might or might not be the reason for my social anxiety and extreme awkwardness. I am trying to spend some alone time with my thoughts and emotions probably for the first time in a while or ever. I was always seen as a friendly and bright child yet now even my parents say \"where did that child go?\". I wish I had an answer. I am terrified of dealing with the real world on my own and always avoided it yet now I'm an adult and it's getting harder and harder to escape from it. I wish I would embrace my insecurities as a child rather than trying to hide them because now I'm left with nothing. I used to wanna spend time with people, not go home where I shut down but now it's the exact opposite. I don't reply to people who wanna spend time with me and always try to lie my way out of going out and \"enjoying\" life. My room became my save space, or an illusion for it and rather it's a prison. After spending so much time at home during covid and after, I feel disconnected from my life prior. I promised myself I'm gonna do smth with my life once this home prison is over yet I never want it to end. I don't want to step my foot outside into the unknown. It's easier to rot inside with music and the internet and never form a single thought. Real world seems so distant to me now but I don't wanna explore it. Am I too lost or is there any chance for me to find myself and enjoy it at the end... smth I keep asking myself constantly. Like many suicidal kids, I never expected to have a future and be an adult yet here I am. With no hobbies and no desires. No dreams and I'm afraid to say, probably with no future as well. Smoking after some time makes me light headed and I finally feel like I couldn't care less about my insecurities, people's thoughts about me, responsibilities, life, anything. I wish I could feel so free all the time rather than being ridden with anxiety constantly, even if there is no reason for it. Maybe that's why I love being locked in my room where anxiety can't reach me. If there is anyone who relates to smth I mentioned, I'm glad I am not alone even though at the end of the day it doesn't matter cause I am actually alone. Will I one day go for a midnight ride, crash and that will be my end or will I finally wake up and live a nice, peaceful life at the end? Or will I never reach that point due to the years of me neglecting my health? I guess time will only tell. And till that point I can only wonder and see how my \"story\" ends.",

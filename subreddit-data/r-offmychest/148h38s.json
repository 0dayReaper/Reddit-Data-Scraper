    "postText": "Hey I'm sorry this probably isn't the best place to post, I tried going to an overthinking subreddit but I wasn't able to post even after joining. \n\nI cannot stop overthinking, it's something i can't control and it makes me do actions I wouldn't do if I weren't overthinking all of the time. I genuinely cannot help it, it affectsmy relationship with my family, close ones and even pass partners and the current one. My thoughts are so sporadic and come to the worst of conclusions, I genuinely cannot help it and I need some type of help. Or i think i do? I dont even know, my overthinking has gotten worse in the past few months now that im in a relationship. Does anyone know how i can help myself here? Is there any cure for this? In any way to cope with it too? Please I'm begging this is a serious issue that needs to be resolved or put in the right way immediatly because I can't stop overthinking for anything that I do. I cannot and it's hurting me so fucking much it's not even funny. Please, anyone",

Tell a doctor who you trust, book a therapy appointment, really just find a professional who can actually figure out what help you need. In the meantime, is there anything that helps you when you overthink? Does telling someone help? Sometimes venting or alternatively, problem solving with another person can help with overthinking. Although it doesn\u2019t work for everyone, does talking about your thoughts with someone else ever help?\n\nIt\u2019s probably still important that you seek advice from a medical professional though, don\u2019t feel like you have to solve this problem alone!",

Thank you, I'm not able to find any professional help at the moment but I don't exactly have anything that helps, although I do have a twitter account i tend to write my overthinking thoughts down but it isn't much help. But I'll try to see if I can find someone to tell them my overthinking, and some of the other suggestions you've said. Thank you.",

We work at an IT company\u2026.\n\nOne talked about shooting them and when seeing their missing posters, they would call the owners saying \u201c theyyyyreee deaaad\u201c. \nThis made me really upset because I have two cats at home\u2026\nSince when is it cool to joke about killing other peoples pets?",

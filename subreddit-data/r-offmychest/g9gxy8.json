    "postText": "I grew up in a very toxic, unstable environment. My dream is to find that feeling of home and have a space that\u2019s stable, safe and secure. \n\nI somehow had this conversation of home the first night I ever met my now fianc\u00e9, when we were randomly talking about our childhood. I told him the concept of \u201chome\u201d is so important to me, and I\u2019m very particular about the environment I live in. I can only hope that one day I can achieve that. \nMy fianc\u00e9 owns a construction company, and we\u2019ve been browsing houses to purchase over the last year, but none ever felt quite right. We viewed a piece of land out in the deep country last spring that is absolutely divine, and we talked about how we wished we could purchase it and build a dream home on it. I had never thought we could actually do it. \n\nLittle did I know, not long after my fianc\u00e9 made the decision to purchase the land and start building.\nOur anniversary was this past weekend, and he told me he had a surprise for me. He blindfolded me, put me in the passenger seat and giggled like a 5 year old the whole way there. When I removed that blindfold and took in what I was looking at, I couldn\u2019t even believe it. After asking \u201care you serious.....?\u201d About 10 times, I started bawling. It has everything I\u2019ve always talked about. A quaint, classic farmhouse design, a wrap around porch, a mud room at the front with a double entry like I\u2019ve always said I wanted (it makes me feel safe, I don\u2019t know why) and while it\u2019s not quite finished like it was supposed to be yet, because of everything going on in the world, it\u2019s absolutely perfect. I truly can\u2019t believe I have this much good luck with this perfect man after spending a lifetime not knowing where home was, or how that felt. Now I know.",

People are forgetting what love, care, humility, passion and respect is. They cheat, deceive, hurt each other and play with each other's feelings. \n\nSo to learn about these kinds of stories fill me with hope that there are still people like that.

Remember that he loves you first. \n\nAlways remember it\u2019s you two against the world.  That always comes first. I hope you two have a beautiful life and lots of babies and blah blah blah just know some of here are jealous cuz we never got a hot rich guy who owns his own company to build us our dream house \ud83e\udd23",

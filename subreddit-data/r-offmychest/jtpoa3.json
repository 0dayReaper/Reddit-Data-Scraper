I was at the deli counter when I spotted them and as they too approached rhe counter I made sure to keep my distance waiting for the deli workers to ask them to use a mask while there and they just acted like everything was normal. Which I understand, its not necessarily *their* job and minimum wage isnt enough to get stomped on by corporate for \"upsetting a loyal customer\". But damn I was seething. Two young kids in the basket, husband and wife duo. Guy had the nerve to cough a few times and then stare down a passer by who was looking at them as though the passer by was the one not taking a pandemic seriously. \n\nI didnt complete my order just took what they had completed and ran for it. I am terrified I haven't done enough as it stands. My fiance, my *baby*, fucking *me*. I dont want to die because some anti masker happened to want turkey when I was around. I scrubbed myself down as best I could and put my clothes immediately in the washer disinfecting EVERYTHING. but I cant quarantine myself from my family. Its legitimately impossible as my fiance cant NOT work for two weeks while I quarantine for possible exposure and we have no one to watch our baby if I did. \n\nIm wearing a mask in my own home. Wearing gloves now when touching things. Knowing damn well its probably not enough and that if I have it they will more than likely get it too. But damn. My family could be killed because those bastards wanted turkery and couldnt be damned to wear a mask while doing so.",

The more someone walks in and out of that door the more difficult it is to hit sales metrics because the counter won't see it as the same person going in and out, it'll see it as new people going in and out each time, which therefore increases the number of people that have to walk out with some sort of new activation or product. All phone stores and some retail mall stores have this system as well. When I worked at LUSH, us employees weren't allowed anywhere near the door unless we were entering/leaving for our shifts and breaks because it could trip off the counter",

We have groceries delivered, and we wipe them down before putting them away. We have seen \"people\" only outside and at a distance. Now I am stressing out about Thanksgiving. My daughter and her boyfriend (whom we have not yet met; they have only been dating since spring) want to come for Thanksgiving. I want them to come. I want to meet him. I want to see my daughter again. But I am secretly kind of terrified. We will take precautions and they are going to get a rapid test before they come, but it will be the first time an unmasked person has been in our house since March, and for any length of time. I don't mean to be melodramatic but sometimes I just spiral into feeling sure that this thing is going to be the end of me and probably my husband also. And if so at least maybe I will see my daughter again this holiday season before it gets us.",

I\u2019m high risk because my body doesn\u2019t break down clots properly and I bruise easily. It\u2019s been really hard to not feel bad about saying no to people especially when my husband does it knowing he really misses people. They get mad at us I think (not to our faces) that we are still making a deal about it. One laughed when I said I can\u2019t come for dinner because I found out he had been going to the gym. \n\nI\u2019m only young 34 and most people around me are like ohh it\u2019s fine. Lockdown fatigue is a real thing! And especially where I\u2019m from as we had the virus early. What you wrote is always refreshing to read because it\u2019s reminds me I\u2019m doing the right thing. \n\nThis is why I wrote anyway:\n\nAfter 6 months of being super careful I was starting to get a little bit lax which isn\u2019t good because I\u2019m high risk due to a blood clot disorder. I had started to see some extra people outside my bubble/it was summer.\n\nThen I had to go into NY Langone for a covid test before a routine procedure (endoscopy) and I was talking to the nurse who tested me and said thankyou for taking on such a high risk job. She looked at me and said this isnt the half of it. She told me she had been working in ICU between March until August and it was the most heartbreaking tragic time of her life. She started crying and said I\u2019m so sorry it\u2019s just so hard, I\u2019m still struggling. You would think it would be all old people dying but it was you! It was the young fit ones that would come in and be talking to me just like you are with a slight cough and then hours later suddenly they would deteriorate and be ventilated and that was it. Every second one would die. She said she has been working as nurse for 25 years and has never seen anything like this...there is no pattern.\n\nShe said please please don\u2019t stop being careful. Not until it\u2019s under control and it\u2019s safe. She said I see everyone just not caring as much but it\u2019s still there and it\u2019s going to come back when it gets colder. She said there is nothing more heartbreaking than having a two year old say bye to his 39 year old mama through FaceTime asking when she is coming home. She ended with please I really don\u2019t want to see your face again in ICU.\n\nIt hit me and reminded me I needed to step it up. I told everyone I could (mainly via text and FaceTime) about that interaction and keep reminding people we may have forgotten the virus but it hasn\u2019t forgot us.\n\nHer tears were too real.",

They invited us to a Halloween party (they are pretty relaxed about covid) and we refused. We proposed to have a get together outside with just the 4 of us before they went to their party cause we missed them and wanted to see them.

My mom is asthmatic and also recovering from a torn Achilles\u2019 tendon so her immune system is kinda fucked right now. she got every symptom in the book except for loss of taste/smell. She had a moderate case and I talked to her over the phone and video chatted and and it was horrible hearing her cough like that. It never got to the point of hospitalization thankfully but it was scary. My dad died of a sudden pulmonary embolism when I was 16 and I thought I was going to lose my mom and become a homeless orphan (I still live with her I\u2019m just away at school) at 21",

In fact I'm wearing a mask right now in the privacy of my home. My DH is too. We had a small circle of family that we socialized with occasionally. Husband spent time with them last Sunday helping to fix something. They were alerted to exposure by contact tracing and now their whole family has Covid-19. My DH had a test yesterday. He was told the labs are very behind in processing tests due to the overwhelming number of tests coming in. It may be as long as a week. I wasn't exposed and as soon as we found out I got my mask on. I would not do well with Covid-19 either. I'm so sorry for your loss. I feel your rage and pain and helplessness. I wear my mask.",

No one should be protesting against masks. \n\nLost my brother to it just a week before his 38th birthday back in April. Couldn\u2019t visit him in the hospital and couldn\u2019t have a proper funeral due to social distancing restrictions. Only my parents and a church pastor were allowed to go to the burial. Got the virus myself (I\u2019m (23f) 4\u201911, 100 pounds) and had pneumonia within a matter of days. Couldn\u2019t taste anything at all and it was beyond what I\u2019d experienced before. Just painful to breathe and didn\u2019t feel like doing anything at all. Had to wear a mask in the house 24/7 when I left my room and clean frequently. Everyone in our household had gotten it and I wish we\u2019d taken it more seriously. \n\nI\u2019m all better now, as is everyone else in my family but I hate that there are still anti-maskers/conspiracy theorists out there down playing it. It\u2019s very real. Imagine grieving the loss of a loved one with pain every time you take a breath as your self-isolating in your room all alone. It\u2019s not a fucking joke, you can wear a mask when you leave the house. I did it through pneumonia, anxiety and sobbing.",

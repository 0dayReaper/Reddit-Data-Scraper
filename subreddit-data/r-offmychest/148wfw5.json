    "postText": "So yeah, i don\u2019t have a degree, i haven\u2019t established any credit yet, I\u2019ve been unemployed for a year and a half, my depression is at an all-time high (or low? Depending on how you look at it i guess), i hate the way i look, I feel completely hopeless all the time, i had a girlfriend for a little bit but she left without a clear answer as to why - though i can speculate that it probably has to do with my lack of motivation and my overall glum demeanor. I\u2019m an alcoholic, addicted to (and definitely abuse) my ADHD meds, and i feel like I\u2019m always teetering in and out of getting better and going full tilt into substance abuse when things get especially hard to handle like when I\u2019m going through a particularly emotionally taxing moment in life. I have some chronic health issues that make me feel like i can\u2019t live the life i wish i could (No, not ADHD), which i know isn\u2019t exactly true but i can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m tied down by some of those issues. I\u2019m in therapy, but i find it difficult to be completely honest with my therapist about how difficult life has felt lately, about how worthless I feel and with how I feel like nothing will ever change or get better. People only ever ask me how I\u2019m doing when I\u2019m super despondent or when they felt like they haven\u2019t heard from me in a while (which is usually around the 3 week - 1 month mark), or someone might only say something when i make a snide comment about how I\u2019m feeling and how i feel like I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to. I know people have their own lives and their own concerns to look after but it makes me feel so lonely that no one really bothers to check in on me or to really ask about how i feel, not my mom, not my siblings, not my friends, no one. My mom is a saint and as patient as one can be with someone like me and sometimes she\u2019ll make a comment about how she\u2019s worried about me but she doesn\u2019t actually listen when i try to be honest with her about just how hopeless and sad i feel every day, she has a kind of boomer mentality when it comes to mental health and her suggestions are always something along the lines of \u201cyou need to spend more time outside\u201d and that\u2019s hard in and of itself  when my mom is the person i feel the closest to. All i do is lay in bed all day every day, I\u2019ve tried listening to people who\u2019ve told me i need to go and do something outdoors even if it\u2019s just a short walk once a day, i tried being consistently active or busy in one regard or another for a while and i still occasionally try to keep busy or at least spend some time outside and in the sun, but it doesn\u2019t fix this constant looming despair and this feeling like even if i do find something that i can enjoy it won\u2019t matter because it still won\u2019t distract me from feeling meaningless and like I\u2019m a lost cause. I can\u2019t shake feeling like there\u2019s no point to anything, no point to living but also no point to dying, I\u2019m a blip, just meaningless nothingness in the grand scheme of things. I\u2019ll live and I\u2019ll die, and I\u2019ll probably never make much of an impact or am impression, but even if I\u2019m able to, will it matter? . I don\u2019t want to die, i just don\u2019t really see the point in living (no I don\u2019t have plan in place, killing myself would leave my mom absolutely broken and i don\u2019t care enough about myself to be that selfish). I\u2019m sorry if this comes off as whiny or wordy and pedantic, i just needed to get these feelings written down and to put them out somewhere. Thank you for reading and I\u2019m so very sorry if you currently feel the same way that i do or if you have ever felt this way, it\u2019s not something i would wish onto anyone and i hope one day things will be different.",

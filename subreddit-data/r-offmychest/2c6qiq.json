    "postText": "Some backstory:\n\nI'm a 24 year old guy, I love tooling around on old cars, something I've done together with my dad since I was a kid, he was all too happy to have me carry it on.\n\nSo I work your typical 8 to 4-5 schedule, and quite often I'm in the garage after work fixing up this old mustang I've been on for the last two years or so. (A completely unrestored '65 mustang that my dad has had for years, to take on now that I'm out in the world, that was a special moment). \n\nSo one day, I started leaving the garage door open, and its to the front so pretty much everyone can see what I'm doing, people stop by, chat, say hello, its great, I always love to chat it up, especially older folks that are happy to see a young guy getting his hands dirty working hard on a classic. \n\nSo about a year ago during the summer, the neighbors mom asked if I could look after their little girl Rachel, a quiet little girl that always seemed well behaved. I didn't mind, but I said I'm really committed to working on this car, if you feel good enough to let her over here while I'm working on the car, not a problem. \n\nTurns out they're going through a divorce, the dad works the 3rd shift, the mom's got a part time gig, evening hours just aren't good for em. Ok, so this starts, and it goes fine. She's quiet, usually reading books or watching the TV I brought out so she would be around me. I always made sure to be courteous, firm, and try out dad humor every now and then. Well, she starts to come out of her shell after a while and it was a joy.\n\nI still remember when she first asked about why I was working on the car:\n\n\"Why are you working on that car when you have one thats newer and works?\"\n\n\"Well, this car is about 45 years older than the other one, its a classic. She'll be much prettier when I'm done with her. I've been sitting in the garage helping my pop since I was younger than you! I always wanted to be like him and so I'd sit and learn and eventually he let me help.\"\n\n\"Oh. Whenever I see dad he's always sleeping.\"\n\n\"Well, he's working hard to provide for you, he's working a tough job.\" \n\nShe just kind of was quiet after that. But after two or three months, she started being cheerful when she came over, always asking questions about what I was doing specifically. This part and that, why it needed to be done, what made it work. I was glad to impart knowledge, I think everyone likes teaching a bit, especially something you're passionate about. \n\nI started teaching her about tools, how to recognize which ones you need, what they can do on a car or around the house. She started to light up, I got the sense that besides school.. she didn't have much of a parental figure. Or anyone to teach her anything about life, or anything. \n\nOne time my dad visited in his '66 GT convertible, and I took her for a ride in it. \n\nI'll always remember how she smiled, saying, \"Is this what yours is going to be like?\" \n\n\"Should be, but mines a coupe so it won't be quite as nice.\"\n\n\"Nooo, yours will be much better! Cause we've been doing it!\"\n\nMy chin started to wobble and I just smiled and said you're right, it will be. \n\nShe'd really started to grow on me, I mean, it would be impossible not to let her into your heart. A bright eyed smart little girl that just soaks up everything you teach her, wants to learn, and looks up to you like that.\n\nIt made me sad, because the times I saw her parents interact they were always snide or yelling at each other, when they were around that is. This spring I started noticing the mother leaving without a uniform, sometimes dressed to go out. I came to the conclusion she quit or wasn't working, but still taking advantage of me babysitting. Which I didn't mind in the slightest. \n\nSometimes Rachel would be quiet more when she came over, but I always waited until she would open up. She'd let out tidbits like, \"Mommy woke me up late at night, she was acting funny.\" Or, \"She came home with someone that wasn't daddy\" or the like. It would pierce my heart, but I didn't know what to do except keep being a safe harbor for her of sorts. She started hugging me more often, squeezing me as hard as she could. I'd always get a lump in my throat. \n\nShe's just wormed her way into my heart, how when I take a break and sit down, she'll climb all over me until I give her the proper attention, every now and then when she does some mannerism or phrase she picked up from me.. even just when I ask her to hand me a tool and she picks the proper one no problem.\n\nWe had some of the best times I can remember, just tinkering under my car, her with a raggedy old sweater of mine on with safety glasses so old dirt wouldn't fall in her eyes, watching me work, asking away. One time she nicked herself on the edge of the radiator support and I picked her up and went to bandage it up. \n\nI told her, \"Most girls your age would cry if they got that little cut.\" \n\nShe said brightly, \"Now my hands are gonna get all beat up like yours!\"\n\nI didn't even know what to say so I burst out laughing (plus another lump in the throat) and hugged her and said, \"You're the best little girl in the world you know that?\" \n\nThen a few weeks ago, her mom came over and said they were going to get a divorce, and if I could still keep watching her during the week. I told her I was sorry and absolutely, she's a delight to have around. \n\nYesterday she was morose, and quiet unlike she had been in a long time. Turns out her parents will be separating and they'll have to move soon. She started crying and hugged me, asking if it meant she won't be able to come over anymore. I started tearing up a bit and choked out, I don't know Rachel, I don't know. I hope you can. I love you, you know that? You're the smartest, cutest, best little girl in the world and I love you.\"\n\nShe just cried all the harder and said I love you too. \n\nShe even asked if she could stay with me. Again I said I don't know, but I don't think it's in the cards. \n\nWhen she left yesterday I just sat down with a bottle of jack and started crying. I just can't take it. That sweet beautiful little girl that wants to be just like me, giggles when she gets grease on her, tosses on my old dirty sweater when she comes over cause she wants to help. I just want to take her up in my arms and take away that pain. She doesn't deserve to have a shitty childhood growing up with a nonexistant father or a shitty mother. Fuck I just can't deal with it. It fucking tears my heart apart.\n\nTL;DR : Start babysitting a little neighbor girl with shitty parents, we have the best time together over the past year, parents are divorcing, will move away soon. Fuckin hell ",

But reading all of this has given me heart and more resolve to be there for Rachel. She deserves as much. I will be making every effort.",

No matter how shitty of a parent one can be, I cannot imagine they would refuse that. If worst comes to worse, you could make a blog dedicated to her and both of you guys' project. Everyday or every week, you take meaningful pictures of the car or parts and tools with your dirty hands. Have the date. Include the outside of the garage with the sun or lack of sun, the rain, or whatever she would see on that day. Try to keep it natural, like she was already there and you didn't have to emphasis much, because she would already understand your jokes, and you can be instructive as if she was there. Teach her a tool she hasn't learned yet. Car parts. Try not to be obsessive about loving her, though.\n\nJust be yourself.\n\nOne of these days, she'll look online to learn more about this passion of cars, or whatever, and she will most likely find your blog. Maybe not for a decade, but then she'll email you and you can be a slab of solid ground again. The earlier she gets in contact with you the better. I feel probably what you feel: neither parent of hers is competent. You have to be like that awesome uncle, that will probably be hard to see because her parents won't let her go and see you. Tough situation. Beyond me. Good luck, bro.",

He taught me that there was a lot more to understand about things like metalworking and that expertise and skill were just as important as knowledge; he also, more importantly, sparked an interest in weapons as something more than just shiny toys and stories about the middle ages (video games were barely just a thing when I was ~8), showing me how much planning and information had to go into making a sword in the first place, including custom-making swords for specific styles and sizes of people.\n\nThis blossomed into a serious interest in Shaolin kung fu after seeing a National Geographic documentary on the martial monks, that 20 years later resulted in finding an authentic and traditional Sifu, turning me into a student of Shaolin as well as leading me on a path to Ch'an Buddhism and a much happier and more fulfilling life than I ever imagined possible for someone with depression and health issues.\n\nThere's no doubt you've had a profound impact on this little girl, and hopefully you've sparked such an interest in her that she might go on to become a mechanic in her own time, or something similarly amazing, because *you* have shown her that she's capable in a way others may just never have had the opportunity to (yet).\n\nHave a heart-to-heart with her before she goes that's about *her*, not your feelings, and after, you'll feel better, and can take the time to address your feelings with your friends (or your Jack ;D).\n\nCheers on you for being her rock during a storm.",

Keep the parents in the loop and ideally another at all times. This is a shame to say but you have to be forward thinking. \nToo many people cringe at the word love but I think you used it perfectly. Her future has dark spots ahead but her parents may improve as they sort themselves. Be that rock dude and hopefully they won't go too far. If your committed you could gently suggest that if they don't move too far you could still help out. But be careful.

For example, one parent might suggest the other let something unsavory go on by giving a childless man access to their young daughter, even taking her off in his car unsupervised.  \n\nI know this sounds creepy and disgusting.  I hate typing it.  I'm just taken aback by the number of people who question the interest of a man in young children.  I have intelligent, educated friends who won't hire our best babysitter, even though they know him from our afterschool program, because he's male and a male babysitter makes them \"uncomfortable.\"  The mind boggles.\n\nI believe you have probably been a marvelous influence on this girl's life, even in this short time, and I hope you find a way to continue. You're a blessing to her.  But just be careful.  Don't give them opportunity to use your loving influence as some kind of twisted weapon. ",

Their parents had a nasty divorce, and though the younger one doesn't remember it, the 8year old does. She gets anxiety and panic attacks. Her dad doesn't want to be a real perent, (not to them anyway he has two step kids and a new son he just LOVES) he wants to just be the fun dad. He refuses to do homework or doctor visits with either of them because \"that's their moms job\" they went a whole weekend with no medication.  And the little one has asthma!!!\n They're on a huge vacation in Florida right now with their dad and their step mom and her two step siblings, SeaWorld, Legoland and Disney World. My sister is in a low income apartment, working long hours to stay afloat. how do you think this makes her look to them? She can't afford to do anything fun like that with them! He weaseled his way out of paying full child support in the court agreement and he threatens to take them away every few months to get her to do something he wants. \n But you know what? they have a real father figure, my fiance. He helped tutor them with homework this year, saved the younger one from repeating first grade. he takes them to the doctor he'll pick them up from daycare. Anything my sister needs he'll help out with (I can't drive) he even takes them out once a week just to go do something fun, he'll go get them outside and hiking or swimming anything outside. \nHe will take them to the emergency room and their dad will be nowhere in sight, its pathetic.  But they like daddy better than mommy because he's more fun. It just fucking sucks. \n\nAnyway I really hope things work out, maybe they're not moving that far away and you can still see her? You must update!",

I was around her a lot, played with her everyday, and watched her grow even more lovely every minute. She became like a little sister to me. Then, one day, her abusive father took her away from me. He moved to Arizona with some girl he met online a week prior. Her mother had already abandoned her as a baby and was no where to be found. The only way I get to see her is in the occasional picture my aunt (her grandma) sends me. She looks so sad in every picture.\n\nI know how much you are hurting. It'll get easier each day. Keep your chin up. She will never forget you.",

A lot of my co-workers will sleep during the day, and then nap from 7pm-9pm. If I did that, I'd never see my family.\n\nI get up at 4pm, and my wife and kids get home by 4:45-5:00. I then stay up until I have to leave for work at 9:30pm to catch at 10pm train into the city.\n\nI usually go to bed around 10am in the morning (so sleep from 10am-4pm)\n\nYou're a good person for watching over that little girl. I think you will have a bigger influence in her life than either of you realise. \n\nIf you really want to still be in her life, I suggest you invite the mother over for a coffee at your place, and explain how much you enjoy her daughter's company and that you would like to act as a \"big brother\" (as in the organization) for her. Being a positive male role model for her daughter.\n\nIf the mother is smart, she'll jump at the chance, because being a single mom is tough, and it would be good for her daughter, and also allow the mom to have some \"adult time\". The only problem to this scenario is if they move too far away to make this viable.\n\nIf that does happen, then ask if her daughter and you can be pen pals. It would give an excuse for the daughter to practice her writing skills, and also to keep in touch, and have a positive and constant friend that will be there. Plus you can exchange photos and what not. \n\nJust some ideas.\n",

You is important.\" \n\nChildren never forget the love the receive.  I babysat a then 6 year old when I was about 13/14 and lived with his mom.  She was dating a lot, going through the motions and my own parents social circle.  Plenty of times my mom gave the death glare to D's mom when having to pick me up at 1:00 AM on a school night because she'd stumble  in after last call. \n\nBut...years later, 10 to 15 years or so, thanks to Facebook D was able to reconnect with me and turns out, he remembered so many of those moments as did his brother a few years older than him and my younger brothers age...that he told me as a young child, I stood out because I was \"there\" and \"present\" for him, listened to him, read to him at a time in which he was old enough his parents and brother were 'absent' from him in dealing with their own emotional hurdles.\n\nSo it sticks.. she will gain so much from you  that will carry, especially in being a tom boy.  The most precious part, to me as an outsider, you taught this lovely young girl that we too can do things that boys do, and even do it better. \n\nFor me, loving working with tools and the likes, this is so vital as there are still some stereotypes with certain trades and skills.  Yet she knows \"fuck you, I might be a girl, but hey, I dig this.  BTW you keep that shit up, do you want to know what a vice grip feels like on your balls? Because being a dick ass shit filled douche bag is how you get your balls in a vice grip.\n\nSo, I commend you for being so loving, supportive, providing a little girl a skill set that will prove (shall she chose) a rewarding life, and for being a solid role model at a time she had none other. \n\nWish I could upvote this one like a gazillion times.\n\nNow, excuse me, onions, well, they''re strong when you cut them.",

Because if him I got my BSEE and have a wonderful career. I've always wanted to find him again and tell him \"Thank you so much for being there for me\".\n\nBut I don't even remember his last name, SO it is going to be you -Thank you so much,you don't know how you helped me.

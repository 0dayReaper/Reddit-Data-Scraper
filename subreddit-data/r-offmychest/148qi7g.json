    "postText": "Throwaway account because of the details and sensitivity. My wife spends a minimum of 12 hours every single day on her kindle. She reads first thing in the morning, spends the day on the couch for the most part, and reads at night in bed. We have children and one going to college in the fall and I'm the only income for the family. She hasn't worked in 10+years now and I'm the sole provider for the family. I work from home and it's a huge slap in the face every time I walk by her on the couch and she's either napping or reading. I had to take over the bills in the house because we kept getting late fees because she'd forget to pay them. I handle nearly all the kids school and sports responsibilities and she has really checked out. She reads in the car (not driving) when we are all in the car and reads sometimes at dinner. Whenever appointments need to get done, I'm the one doing them. She zones out and just reads and reads. She also snores a ton and I've spent the last few years sleeping on the couch because I can't sleep next to her. She has yet to ever once volunteer to sleep there and let me have the bed despite the fact that I work, have back problems ( I wonder why), etc. She reads romance novels, typically smutty ones and while it's made our sex life interesting, she's so incredibly vested in her kindle that our home and kids are incredibly distant. I've told her so many times that it bothers me that she spends all day reading and I have asked for her to try and find a job multiple times and to reduce her reading time but it never matters. I've suggested couples therapy but she says that's what people do before they divorce and I tell her that's what people do to avoid divorces... My resentment to her laziness and being able to do next to nothing every day while I'm on zoloft and meds to try and keep myself from having panic attacks is growing each day and I have no happiness left other than via my kids and seeing them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Edit and I think this is what I'm supposed to do as I've never had a post with so much interaction. You all are helpful and I really appreciate it. Another thing I didn't mention is that I'm a heavy cutter and my left arm and shoulder are very scarred from years of it. It's gotten worse and she knows but acts more irritated than concerned when she sees the results of it. I do it to gain control. Just a side note",

This can't be a constructive experience for any of you.  \n\n\nIf she doesn't understand the precarious perch that the relationship is on, that should help inform you of the degree of her denial or detachment.  \n\n\nGood luck.",

I don\u2019t know a single one. Not one. \n\nYou deserve happiness. You deserve a partner who shows up for you and shows up for your children. There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting this. \n\nYou and your kids deserve better.",

If all she does is read, doesn't pursue hobbies or building skills, advancing career, or even invests in any future 'seed planting' stuff, then that's her choice. You can't put your life, physical, mental and emotional health below someone that refuses to engage in 90% of the family life you are supposed to be building together. She's coasting because you seem to be an over-functioning codependent, you're filling in all the gaps she's created while she doesn't fill any of yours, that seems to be on you too. You're enabling this so yeah, put your foot down with loving firmness set some boundaries. I've seen you have a plan to leave if things don't improve which is good, you're giving time and space with an endpoint of what you will do. If she chooses to not improve or work on herself, then she's not choosing the marriage and it's clear what you will need to do. \nYou want a partner in life, not a full grown adolescent that doesn't contribute. This isn't a gap year after highschool. She can either learn to grow up and become a life partner so you can both thrive, or she can learn the hard way through divorce where she'll have to learn to function on her own. Either way, you want more from a partner than what she's currently willing to give, don't let sunk cost fallacy stop you from living a fulfilling life, because we only get one.

Essentially it\u2019s your kindle and if it were to \u2018break\u2019 then you wouldn\u2019t be obliged to replace it. I think leaving isn\u2019t your best option, you need to tell her how you feel. Try to arrange that she only read at certain times like evening maybe? It Almost sounds like obsessive behaviour as ADHD where they neglect their life for an interest. You are enabling her by picking up the pieces such as managing the kids. Let her flounder for awhile. Explain to the kids you need to stop doing everything. Does she even do housework? Maybe find a friend and start going out in the evenings for company. Life can get pretty dull at times and leaving won\u2019t necessarily make you more fulfilled",

Individual therapy for you and family therapy for you and the kids. That effort will mean so much to your kids and matter so much in court. You are the primary parent and earner, if you work on your issues that will matter to a judge. \n\nHow old is the youngest? At 12 in my state judges want the kids sincere input on living arrangements.  \n\nThings will improve when you get the headspace to prioritize your wellness. That will allow you to do the very best by and for your kids. You are worth loving yourself enough to know you need help and seek it out. I wholeheartedly agree with the other poster who said take the kids for a few weeks on vacay or something. A break may be what you need to see things clearly.

You seem to be functioning as a single parent anyway, which means you'll be fine, it'll be hard but it's what you're kinda doing now.\nUpsides is that you won't be lugging around another adult and all of that poisonous resentment, just the kids. Then that opens up the possibilities of you eventually finding a partner that does want to grow a life with you and also cultivates their own individual life too. Someone that inspires you, someone that isn't an anchor. \n\nYour youngest may not see her distant mother as much as she currently does, but that behaviour, the distance and dissociation, the laziness, is not good behaviour to model to children. Having a happy, hard-working and dedicated single father is miles better than a deflated, dissatisfied, resentful, hard working and dedicated father that is married by name only to someone that doesn't seem to value the same things. \nYour children will either replicate your wife's actions: slothful and selfish or yours: over-functioning and self-sacrificial. Both are unhealty, because the relationship is unbalanced and unhealthy. \nShow your kids how to recognise their worth by recognising your own. \n\nSure, she'll turn it on you that you're leaving her without x, y, z to guilt you into staying but also be curious as to why she'll want you to stay: it doesn't seem like it's to do fun things together, build something together etc, it would be because the way things are keeps things easy for her. That's it. \n\nRemind her that she's an adult and has had over a decade to contribute and grow as a functional half of a partnership. She's chosen not to because she doesn't value it. Remind her that you two are married and she's still left you to do the majority of everything she's afraid of doing on her own. She's left you more alone than if you were to split because knowing someone is there that can partake and yet refuses to help or engage in any of it feels so much worse than being alone to do them. It's to feel abandoned and rejected that none of it matters enougn to this person.",

I can easily spend an entire day, and night (if it\u2019s sooo good I\u2019ll even skip sleep) reading. \n\nBut it goes in waves, and I\u2019m also a mother. Every now and then, I spend an entire day reading. I do read daily but like 30 mins here &amp; there. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll go 2-3 weeks just doing my daily reading\u2026 then once a month or so, I\u2019ll get totally absorbed into a good book and spend all day on it.\n\nBut I also work FT &amp; sometimes a PT job. Husband has a disability so he cooks &amp; does some light cleaning (dishes, laundry &amp; that sort). I handle everything else basically though - bills, car repairs, appointments, deeper cleans or like baseboards, etc. \n\nI have bipolar &amp; I know when I\u2019m in the dumps (having a depressive episode) when I\u2019ve decided to totally escape into books. Been known to do this. I\u2019ll easily read 15+ books in a month if I let myself.\n\nI refuse to buy books new. I also won\u2019t buy ebooks except maybe 1 a month. I do use the library overdrive / Libby app a lot too though.\n\nSounds like your wife has some things she needs to work out, honestly. \n\nMy moms bipolar too and it was also something I noticed about her growing up : she\u2019d disappear into books whenever she\u2019d hit a low spot.",

Maybe you could tell her that what you really want for Father\u2019s Day is to spend a day together as a family with no phones/devices so you can all be present with each other, and ask her if she has any suggestions or idea for activities to put on the schedule.\n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll agree to it, that\u2019s not why I\u2019m suggesting it. I\u2019m suggesting it because you\u2019re approaching it in a way where you\u2019re not singling just her and her kindle out for her to get defensive (we can all be present with each other, including your phones, your kids phones or tablets). It\u2019s Father\u2019s Day, an occasion where it makes sense to suggest such a thing. If she protests, it\u2019s all the evidence you need to prove she can\u2019t spend a day (well, really just part of a day) without her kindle, further presenting undeniable proof she has a problem. Then tell her it\u2019s clear that if she can\u2019t even leave her kindle off for one day to spend time with your family, she clearly has a problem, and you\u2019d be supportive of her if she agreed to get therapy (for herself first, couples later)\u2026but if she chooses not to get help, then you can\u2019t, in good conscience and in the best interest of your children, continue to enable her addiction. She will have already set herself up with all the evidence you need when she denies spending the day with you and the kids without it for a special family occasion. Hopefully this will be the wake up call she needs. If not, you know what you probably have to do.",

Don't say \"you neglect me/you ignore me\" say sth like \"I feel like I don't really know what's going on in your head anymore and that makes me afraid of losing you\".

My husband is able to tell when I'm depressed even if I'm hiding all the other symptoms if he notices me reading those all the time. If I'm not depressed I prefer other genres. \n\nIt's not your job to heal her or make her feel better if that's the case, but have you tried to do more romantic things? Even if she's not sometimes breaking the everyday routine, it helps a relationship a lot. Talk to her and tell her how you feel. Don't make her feel like she's being attacked but just explain how you wish she spent more time with you and the kids. How it feels like she's avoiding everyone. How burnt out you feel. Etc.

And though she did work an 8 hour a day job, as soon as she came home she laid in her bed and read romance novels. Weekends - all day in bed reading. EXCEPT for when she was picking fights with my dad. We had a miserable childhood and I had to get much older to realize my mother has some sort of mental illness. Depression for sure, but probably some bipolar mixed in there too. And now she is in her 80's and my father is long dead. She still spends all of her time reading or watching old Westerns on TV.  If you wish to save your marriage you are going to need help. Marriage counseling, counseling and probably medication for her.

If you want to put in a last ditch effort to be as direct as possible tell her that if she doesn\u2019t try therapy or wean off the kindle you will divorce her/or you will be done. That way she can\u2019t be in shock when she gets the papers, but I also don\u2019t know how that works and if she\u2019ll try to take half your money with advance notice, I can just relate to wanting to give a relationship every last part of me I have left, but maybe that\u2019s not healthy, and maybe you\u2019ve already tried hard enough. Best of luck.",

My reading is limited to bed times, nap times and any quiet time. Even then I don\u2019t read every day or for long periods. \n\nBut I did previously and it occasionally happens. Usually as a form of escapism because of my depression and then it starts a depression spiral. Because I\u2019m depressed so I read, but now I\u2019m more depressed because I\u2019m doing nothing but reading and then my depression gets worse because I don\u2019t want to eat or sleep or bathe, I just want to lose myself in a book that has nothing to do with my life. \n\nIf she\u2019s actively refusing to see a problem, speak to a therapist or a couples counselor, then I think separating may be your only option for either of you to obtain happiness. I don\u2019t want to say you should give her an ultimatum but I do think you need to have that final sit down and tell her that you can\u2019t continue to live like this, you need her to be present and get help or take a break from reading as much.",

I\u2019m deeply thinking about separation. I feel as if I am carrying the weight of our family and I don\u2019t want to do this alone. I want you to start being responsible in our bills (setting alarms and use a calendar if you need) and to participate with the kids. All the responsibility cannot fall on me because I want a partner is supports me too. Either you start working again or taking care of the kids and the home.if this is depression, you need to seek professional help. Either you change or I am looking to divorce. I need you to be better for yourself and for me. If this is something you\u2019re not interested in that\u2019s fine, but I hope you can understand my decision to leave you at it\u201d",

When it comes to abuse, which this is, it\u2019s best to remove the children asap and get them into therapy. Your daughter will struggle no matter when you do it, but the earlier the better so they can experience some semblance of a normal, healthy upbringing.",

She\u2019s avoiding something and you need to really sit down and try to get her to open up about what\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s not gonna be overnight but hopefully a little bit at a time, yall can agree on something to help. Sadly, she\u2019s gotta admit there\u2019s a problem first and that\u2019s the first step. \n\nI kinda had the same issue with my phone, though never 12 hours a day and I also have a job and other responsibilities. In my case, scrolling on social media calmed my anxiety and depression and kept me from very negative and harmful thoughts and having to deal with past trauma. Also, I have adhd, so  perfect candidate for phone addiction. I\u2019m figuring that could be the same for her.",

I was there myself... but I want to point out the obvious... idk if someone else has mentioned it because I haven't read the comments yet- but your wife appears to be addicted to the fantasy world she enters when she reads. Which is ok until it becomes an addiction. It interferes with everyday life and her responsibilities. Much like a drug addiction.  Or shopping addiction.  Or gambling or anything else that would keep you from working and taking care of your kids. Perhaps you should try to see it in that light before you try to approach it. The whole goal is to remain a family but to get her to see what she is doing so she can get help for it. And speaking of help.... you should consider talking to someone. Yesterday. If things go left with your wife you need all your ducks in a row so you can be the primary caregiver- that's straight up real talk. Cuz we all know dads start behind the eight ball in family court. Worry about you first. Then worry about her. Chances are when you start to better yourself and not really care to bother with her and the mess she's causing, that's when she'll perk up and start asking questions. Wanting to know what you're up to and why you aren't doing the same old same old. Do you understand what I mean? If she wants to check out, treat her accordingly.",

    "postText": "Back before we had gotten together he choked her twice and she was not afraid there is even an ofp on her. But why I\u2019m glad is because she found out I am pregnant. She can\u2019t have anymore kids. They have one together who she put an ofp on so \u201che can never see his son again\u201d I\u2019ve seen the messages. The reason he choked her was the first time she insulted him by saying he was just like his piece of shit father. Whom she has never met. And the second time she stabbed him with a hunting knife. In the right arm you can see the scar from it. But she deserved to be choked. She is an awful person and an awful mother. If I was him, I\u2019d choke her too. Plus he might be going to jail before I even give birth. It\u2019s for an ofp violation that happened by accident. I\u2019ve heard the story from multiple people. But if he gets found guilty then he will go to prison for 5 years. So because of this fact. If he does get sentenced. I\u2019ll have no issues getting charged with assault with deadly weapon. She better watch her fat 300 pound back.",

It you're silly enough to believe his excuses for putting his hands on a woman in anger, you're silly enough to ignore the fact he's capable of doing it to you too if you say or do something he doesn't like!\nThe poor children you toxic people are raising... IS it too late for you to terminate? By the sounds of you all, that's the best option for that poor baby",

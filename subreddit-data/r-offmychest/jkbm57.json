    "postText": "My partner has to wake up around 4am in the morning for work. He has two alarms. One is at 4:30, the other is 4:35. I questioned why he had them so close together, and he said \"Eh, it just helps me.\" This morning I pieced together what he's been doing every morning since he started this job two months ago.\n\n\nThe first alarm is solely his warning signal, and he uses it to get 5 minutes of hugging me every morning. Every. Morning. This poor guy is tired af every day, but he makes sure that every morning before work he cuddles me for at least five minutes. Some days I don't get woken up by him, and it's sweet to think that no matter what he makes the time to be affectionate to me before he leaves. \n\n\nI adore him.\n\n\nEdit: Please share your stories with me. I'm on a love high and want to keep it going.\n\nEdit2: I can't possibly keep up with all these responses. This blew up more than I expected. ***BUT PLEASE KEEP THIS GOING! I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE BENEFITING FROM THE LOVE BOOMING OUT OF THESE RESPONSES!***",

On the mornings that I had work, which I also woke up at 3:30 a.m. for to get there for 4 a.m, I would say goodbye and give him a kiss. When we finally moved in together I figured that he\u2019d get annoyed if I woke him up everything morning so I decided to stop doing it. The first day of me coming home from work to what was now our home, he immediately stopped me and asked \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you wake me up before you left? i wanted to say goodbye\u201d. Now I do it every morning and it\u2019s so special to me.",

Got a text about a half hour later asking why I didn't wake him up to say good bye. There have been some mornings where I do wake him up but he's so tired he doesn't even register it and he'll ask later in the day. And then we jokingly fight the rest of the day whether I said bye or not. I love him so much.",

I am tired!!\u201d Something along those lines. He hasn\u2019t done it since ): it breaks my heart that one moment of hostility and I changed something that\u2019s been happening for years. Now sometimes my body wakes me up aggressively because I\u2019m hoping to catch him before he goes but he\u2019s usually already gone for the day, and I leave before he comes home.

The semester barely started but the courses I'm taking are hard, and even harder due to being fully online due to Covid. I was stressing on getting everything done. I ended up falling asleep on the futon my boyfriend and I have in our room. I was so exhausted from stress of school, work, and home life that my body couldn't function anymore. At some point, my boyfriend (21M)  finished his homework and stuff and came up to me. He got on his knees so he could be faced to face instead of leaning over me. He gently woke me up. He asked if I was hungry and if I wanted to watch Atlantis: The Lost Empire (one of my fav movies ever). I simply nodded my head and he gave me a kiss and left for the kitchen. I sat up in a daze and didn't move. \n\nEventually, he came back with food in his hand. He looks to me and jokingly scolded, \"what are you doing? Get on the bed we can eat and cuddle!!\". It made me smile and giggle a little. I climbed into bed and he got the movie all set up. We ate and started cuddling. I was stuck in this state of being really sleepy and barely able to keep my eyes open but staying awake. We had small conversations throughout the movie. At some point he mentioned that if he were to stay quiet long enough I would probably fall asleep and he would get the chance to take a cute picture of me sleeping. I laughed lightly and said he missed his chance when I was on the futon. He disagreed, he said he didn't want to immortalize me passing out from exhaustion and stress. \n\nApparently, that night I wouldn't leave his side when we were sleeping. Any time he moved away I would move closer. I nearly pushed him off the queen sized bed we have but he said it was worth it. \n\nI felt very loved that night, and I still do. He's such an amazing guy. I'm grateful everyday for getting the chance to meet him and have him be a part of my life. Nearly in tears again cause of it.",

I left that hospital job for a better opportunity and so did my wife (who was my gf at the time). My new job had me traveling for 2-3 weeks a month. Traveling prevented me from distracting her as she got her doctorate from a prestigious school. \n\nWhen I wasn\u2019t traveling nationwide - I made sure to have lunch (at a minimum) with my wife everyday. I\u2019d drive to her work ... then drive back to my office to finish work. If she worked late, I\u2019d drive to her job to make sure she got into her car safely- when she headed home (She\u2019s a pharmacist and a few customers have freaked her out - even though she worked in an affluent area). I\u2019d follow her home in my car as we talked in our cellphones. \n\nWhen we got married and I was able to retire early (I\u2019m in my early forties now) I still met her for lunches, but I\u2019d have to take public transportation to meet her late at night. My wife\u2019s car had our assigned spot, but my car was always parked on the street and finding parking was really hard - due to a few bars being close by. \n\nWe have a daughter now and we go see my wife at work frequently. It isn\u2019t as often as I would like because my daughter has a fit when we are leaving - also my wife gets teary eyed. But I send photos and videos of what we are doing to my wife. On average I send about 20-30 throughout the day. \n\nAlso, the flowers I bought my wife never lasted long - so I bought her gold and platinum dipped roses. They are in our living room still - 13 years later.",

I think he does it in his sleep since he sleeptalks but it just gets me every time. \u2728",

Even if I was dead asleep, he\u2019d ALWAYS give me a kiss goodbye and brush his fingers down my face as if he was closing my eyes. Not sure why but it used to melt my heart!! \n\nNow we live together and work different jobs, so we wake up at the same time together. No more finger brushy much to my displeasure but we do have a goodbye kiss before we get into our separate cars and part ways.",

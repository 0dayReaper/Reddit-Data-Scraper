    "postText": "My (17f) dad left my sister (13f) and I when I was 9. He\u2019d have fazes where he\u2019d show up for awhile then leave for awhile and to sum it up, he was very inconsistent. Even when he was living with us he wouldn\u2019t do anything that wasn\u2019t fun or appealing. Plus he was sometimes physically abusive towards my mom and pets. My sister and I grew up always scared of his temper. \n\nBut for the past three years now, him and I have actually been getting along consistently and well. I\u2019d go visit him sometimes in NJ and we\u2019d text. But my mom was still the main parent through all of this.\n\nAbout two months ago, my dad filed for custody of my sister and I. This is most likely due to the fact that him and his current boyfriend are pretty stable. Plus, my younger sister has avoided him for years. This whole ordeal absolutely devastated me. Him and I were doing good. My sister and I also made it very clear since he left that we have no interest in living with him.\n\nHe\u2019s honestly gotten better as well. But my sister and I went in a bit ago and both expressed what we wanted to this counselor lady. Then after the judge and attorneys got the letters she wrote, my dad pulled out of his physical custody claim. This has been eating me alive. My sister and mom are both thrilled and I feel like an idiot for not feeling the same way. I want to stay with my mom, but I feel some sort of stupid obligation to keep my dad happy and I hate it.\n\nI\u2019ve been mad and guilty for days and I hate this. I don\u2019t even know what I feel guilty over exactly. I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong. Any advice?\n\n(P.S. Sorry if it wasn\u2019t very clear, I\u2019m not the best writer)",

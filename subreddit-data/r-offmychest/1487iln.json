    "postText": "I\u2019ve been with my bf for a year and a half now. The whole first year he would talk to females and look at nudes and message those women. I told him in January if it didn\u2019t stop I would leave. If he needed to look at porn look at free stuff that he wouldn\u2019t have or be able to make conversation with. I was just telling my best friend today he\u2019d been doing good. He came home from work hoarding his phone and acting like he was hiding something. When your gut knows, it knows. I looked and he\u2019s been looking at pictures and messaging women telling them just how beautiful they are on here! I never even know you could do that on here!! I\u2019ve only ever used it to look up things like recipes. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f stupid me!!! I feel so damn dumb and hurt. He told another women she was extremely beautiful and he wanted to see more of her body, 2 days before my birthday! No wonder he\u2019s been distant with me. Am I wrong for feeling this way? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

You realize he's doing all of this because of his own poor self image of himself.  Problem is, it's at your expense.  Thing is, when someone is doing things like this for other reasons then for what it actually should be for, it's not ever going to stop unless he undergoes intensive therapy.  In my humble opinion of course.  Good luck dear...",

This is just my opinion based on my experience and what you have told us. I know it\u2019s hard, you love and care about him. But please dump him. He\u2019s not worth your time. He\u2019s showing a huge lack of respect, for you by his actions. You set as boundary, with him and he\u2019s ignored it. Maybe try have a conversation about it, with him to see if he\u2019s willing to help to fix and work on it, with you. If he denies it, you can choose to leave and stick to the boundary, you set with him or if you stay he\u2019ll just keep hurting you.",

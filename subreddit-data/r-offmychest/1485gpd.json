    "postText": "I'm not looking for really anything just want to vent and hope someone can relate.\n\nIve been in and out of mental wards 5x. Im in my early 20's I'm very introverted and socially awkward. \nI've always been told to be extroverted it will make you happy because humans are meant to make connections with others. \n\nAnytime I socialize I over share , I have 2 friends and I'm pretty sure they both hate me because 1 never responds the other just ghosts me. Said I was suicidal to 1 of them (havnt talked to this 1 friend since highschool just recently started talking and hung out 1x) I had a crush on them in highschool they are very aware of it but years after I see this person as a friend, nothing more. \n\nThey said to go get therapy but I can't because I have no insurance, can't get a job because legally I can't drive due to double vision nor can my mom drop me off at any job because of her own job. \n\nI try to be social like going to a local fair we have every year but I have no friends and my mom won't go with me.\n\nI have ADHD, Panic Disorder, BPD (I think it's autism because it doesn't happen unless I'm over stimulated) OCD, and insomnia.\n\nHavnt seen a physician in 4 years so no telling what problems I have physically.\n\nI forget to drink water and eat. My right kidney is in constant pain, severe migraine. I can't ask for help because my brother needs mental help and has asked for some help, I don't want to worry my mom and family because they think I'm doing so good and I'm happy. \n\nTruth is, I'm scared to be happy because for over 20 years , I'll be doing good in life, happy ect. Then shit hits the fan, rinse and repeat.\n \nDon't want to be happy anymore I just want to die. My grandmother unalived herself June 16 2013. As little as I met her as a child around June I'm nothing but depressed and when I realize what month it is it hits different. I can't kill myself because I know it would push a family member to drink again and I can't do that to them plus if I fail I'll be admitted back to the ward. \n\nI will not go out of my way to unalive myself but at the same time I'll just let natural selection happen and hope it does the job.\n\nSorry for the long rant just wanted to vent.",

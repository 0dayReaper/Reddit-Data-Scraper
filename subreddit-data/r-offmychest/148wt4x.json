    "postText": "People work hard to lose weight and become skinny, and not just for their health, but so that way they can stop getting bullied for being fat, to be taken more seriously, to be more attractive to potential partners, to fit in plane/bus/car/even bike seats, any many more reasons. I go on social media and I see people who\u2019ve lost a lot of weight say they experience skinny privilege and it\u2019s sad. I experience it and I\u2019m happy I have skinny privilege. I\u2019m happy I\u2019ve never been fat. I\u2019m glad I worked hard to maintain my body. \n\nIf I was fat and someone bullied me for it, I would do something about it and lose the weight.",

    "postText": "I was severely overweight until two years ago, I got into a diet where I lost 1kg per month at 1000 calories per day. Eight months and -20kg later I was at my goal weight, something healthy for me. I was addicted to seeing the change in the mirror, going from an ugly to an actually average looking guy. I loved getting the reactions from people, and some people not even being able to recognize me. I want to look ugly so that I can have a glow-up, over and over again. I want people to look at me, then a few months later, and think I look unrecognizable. I've gained all the weight I lost back in six months, but my face and body look no different than it did when I lost all the weight. At this point, I don't know what to do. I think I might make myself obese, and then when I lose it all over again I can marvel at my newfound attractiveness. Everyone thinks I'm accidentally falling back into my old, unhealthy habits and becoming fat again. It's no accident... can anybody help? I'm scaring myself.",

    "postText": "He was born happy &amp; healthy. Most beautiful baby I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Happiest day of our life is sadly also the hardest one. We wanted him so bad. Right now where we are in our lives though, barely surviving paycheck to paycheck, food stamps, and living in a shitty ass neighborhood in one of the most expensive overpriced cities in the US, we know we can\u2019t do it with a baby. I\u2019m sad we can\u2019t provide the life he deserves. \n\nWe know the family he\u2019s going to is gonna love him so much. They have been waiting for years to have a child. They\u2019re good people, we know they are. And we know he\u2019s gonna have a good life with them. My girlfriend cried for an hour when it was time to say goodbye. She\u2019s sleeping on me rn. My heart hurts. Hurts deeper than anything I\u2019ve ever felt. I only got to hold him a few mins but it already feels like I can\u2019t breathe without him. \n\nThis is for the best though. We both know it is. \n\nHope one day we can meet again baby boy",

I am wishing you and your girlfriend peace, healing, and brighter days to come.",

Both of his first parents have unfortunately passed, but he was close with them as they grew up. He has half siblings that he is close to as well, and basically, it\u2019s a whole other family to love him. His first parents were young and couldn\u2019t keep him. Their sacrifice completed our family, and he grew up to be a hell of a man. I don\u2019t think the reason is just us. I think it\u2019s because he had so so much love. \n\nYou\u2019re both going through trauma now. It\u2019s going to be hard second guessing if you made the right decision, especially in the coming weeks as your GF\u2019s body heals from the trauma of birth. You\u2019re going to experience grief, guilt, and anger with a little bit of happiness, pride, and relief, and those are complex emotions to sort through. Please consider counseling as well to help you sort through your feelings. \n\nLastly, I don\u2019t know you, but I think you made the best decision for both you and your baby. I\u2019m so sorry this situation happened, but this internet stranger is so very proud of you both for making the decisions you did. Communication with your son\u2019s second family will be crucial in understanding your role as he grows up. Another good thing to remember is, \u201cthis day will not always be today.\u201d  Even if his second family pulls away (not saying they will) or you have to pull away (not saying you will), your son will not always be a baby. He will not always be a child. He will be an adult someday, and I think he\u2019ll need you. I know my brother needed his first family. I feel like I\u2019m rambling, but as a second family, I can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that you will forever be important to them. I can\u2019t express what I feel for my brother\u2019s first family and how much we love him and them. \n\nIn any case, sorry to be forward, but I hope you see this and reach out if you ever need to vent or talk or whatever. And your GF. I\u2019m happy to provide an uninvolved third party ear who has some visibility in what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m sending good thoughts and prayers of healing and peace for you and your GF.",

She was a prostitute and drug addict (and still is in fact) and honestly, I'm glad I was adopted. My life would have turned out much different.\n\nI give you 2 props to realizing that you were in a bad situation. It's not your fault for doing what you did and in fact, I commend you. You knew your little guy was going to have a tough upbringing and you want him to have a better life. That's what a parent wants for their children.\n\nHopefully his parents will raise him right and tell him about you two. And maybe when he's older, he'll want to know about you and search for you. Or you will want to search for him. The great thing  is with DNA testing today and sites like 23 and Me and Ancestry we can often find those that we've separated from long ago. Always remember that.\n\nI'm wishing you 2 the best and wishing the best for your son. I'm keeping you all in my thoughts.",

Again, I am so sorry OP and GF.",

It's insane to think that our society has gotten to such a place where a family who wants to support a baby and start a family just can't. Can you imagine any time in history before us that would break up a family like that? Even in feudal times, or during the great depression, you may of been starving, and it may not of even been the best idea to bring a child into the world, but you still grew the food you needed. In this modern concrete jungle many people don't even have the option to become self sufficient individually. \n\nWe've over-portioned and inflated every good and service to the enth degree and robbed the average young family of the money it needs to support two independent people's, little alone a third or fourth. I'm 24, but even then my mother and father had a home and brought me into the world at 23 and 25... Meanwhile I'm struggling to eat while working 50+ hour work weeks. And I'm by far not alone, as this post any a million other ones like it make evident. It's so unbelievably fucked up. \n\nI legitimately want to start a revolution.",

Doing what you did is one of the hardest things to do, and the level of selflessness it takes to make sure your child gets the best chance at life is extremely hard. I can say at least on my end that while I have not met my birth parents, I am extremely grateful to them for having chosen the right people to give me to. I know that one day I plan on finding them, and I don\u2019t know what will come of it, but I know that I will at least be thanking them for giving me the opportunity to live the great life I\u2019ve lived this far.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you would like to talk at all, but I\u2019d like to at least open up as a random person who has been the subject of what you\u2019re doing and make myself available.\n\nGood luck and I cannot say it enough, but you both are some of the best and strongest people out there for what you have done.",

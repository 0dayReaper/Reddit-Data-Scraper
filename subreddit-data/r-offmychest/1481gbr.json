    "postText": "Around December we got a new coworker will call her Ana. She was young and kind of shy, so I kind of took her under my wing because I remember being that way when I was younger. Soon we started to become friends outside of work, and pretty soon she was telling me stuff about her dating life. She\u2019s a big over-sharer and I found out that she was not a good listener, she would never take the most basic advice like staying away from her ex who would block her and then call her when he wanted sex. And she would go back with him and talk to him about marriage. One thing to note is that in our job there are benefits that married people get. \n\nFast forward to april she stops talking to him and starts seeing our coworker Jake, she\u2019s thrown out there the idea of a contract marriage with him at first. But I guess she saw our friend groups reaction to that and she let it go. But two weeks later when jake went on vacation she started back up the conversation about marriage and how she\u2019s in love. We passed by the ring section in a mall and she was ready to buy him the ring that he would use to propose to her, I tried convincing her that it was a bad idea but that fell on def ears. But thankfully she didn\u2019t buy the ring. Anyways when Jake got back she attempted to have a conversation with him about getting serious and making their relationship official. He basically said it takes him a while to form a real connection with people but they could still talk. Ana was devastated at first but I told her that his perspective makes sense after all it\u2019s only been 3 weeks or so since their first date. And so she made it her mission to get to know him more which I encouraged unfortunately I didn\u2019t know that she meant she was going to shoehorn herself  into his everyday life. For instance, we went to eat ramen and she found out that he went bowling with his friends, so she decided that we were gonna crash the party. I tried to convince her that she was coming off a little strong by doing that but she eventually wore me down after begging me to tag along. I left early because I felt uncomfortable and left her behind. This isn\u2019t the last time she would do something like that, she just stopped asking me to tag along cuz she knew how I felt about that. She would also start to try and include herself in activities his friend group were planning and would try to become friends with them. You could tell with how short with her they were and some of the jabs aimed at her work ethic that they were annoyed with her. But I don\u2019t think she got the hint. \n\nDuring work there wasn\u2019t a minute that went by that she didn\u2019t talk about Jake. It got to the point that I would actively avoid going over by her area because I didn\u2019t want to hear: \n\u201cJakes a piece of shit he hasn\u2019t texted me in an hour.\u201d\n\u201cMe and Jake are gonna get married\u201d\n\u201cJake nutted in me last night\u201d\n\u201cMe and Jake are gonna have biracial babies\u201d \n\u201cI might be pregnant my period is late\u201d\nI do consider myself to be very empathetic and a good listener but nobody wants to have a one sided conversation about the same topic everyday. \n\nSo here comes the part where I think she intentionally got pregnant. (Since I\u2019ve met her It became a monthly reoccurring thing for me to buy her plan b because she was to scared to go herself.) one of Jakes friends confronted her, I don\u2019t remember the exact details but he basically didn\u2019t like the fact that\u2019s she would always find Jake and then join in on what he and his friends were doing. And while she was telling me this she said: \u201call I need is one night and Jake is mine forever.\u201d I was kind of in shock that she would say something like that. And at that moment I contemplated telling Jake, not for him to break up with her but just to warn him to be a little more careful with her. I ended up just keeping it to myself because I didn\u2019t want to involve myself in anything (something I regret now) a week later she tells me she\u2019s pregnant. And doesn\u2019t know what to do or how to tell Jake. I feel bad because I told her she\u2019s got to figure it all out on her own because we\u2019ve all told her to get on birth control and to have a conversation with Jake about him finishing in her. But she would always laugh it off. She ended up telling Jake and was upset that he was shocked and didn\u2019t know what to do. Afterwards we took her out to lunch to get her mind off of things and she kept saying she didn\u2019t know what to do but kept on implying and to an extent trying to get us to tell her that she should carry the baby and that her and Jake would get married. And that\u2019s when we started to piece things together and come to the conclusion that she may have purposefully gotten pregnant to keep him in her life. And I feel terrible that I didn\u2019t warn him",

I went for the middle ground and basically laid this entire post out to his best friend. I told him to encourage Jake to stand his ground and tell her he doesn\u2019t want a child even if that hurts her feelings because the more they wait it off the more she convinces herself it\u2019s a good idea",

She\u2019s definitely sounds a bit unstable and has a very obsessive, unhealthy attachment to guys by the sounds of it. I can see her going off the rails if Jake backs away from her rather than the plan she had in their head to get married and be a family. It\u2019s a bit scary!",

I\u2019ll do my best to talk to her as well even if she doesn\u2019t wanna hear it or take my advice at least someone said something. I\u2019m trying to gather up what I\u2019m going to tell her we have our summer vacation coming up and I know she\u2019s going back home and is gonna get influenced by her toxic friends",

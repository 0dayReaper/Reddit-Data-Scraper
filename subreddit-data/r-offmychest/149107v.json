    "postText": "As it says. \n\nMy dad, who cheated on my mum 8 years ago, insists his girlfriend must be at the front row of the funeral, or he won\u2019t be attending. \n\nMy mum insists the front row should just be the immediate family and pallbearers, or she won\u2019t be able to speak. She said she\u2019d be physically sick if my dads partner is there at all. \n\nMy little brother and I have spent the last 2 weeks desperately trying to find a resolution. We get along with our dads partner but she has personally messaged me to say she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable coming if it\u2019s going to upset me or my brother. When I tried to talk to my dad about it, he stormed off and blocked my number. When I talked to my mum about how we need our dad there and this was a resolution we came to together, she saw straight through the lie and it was like we were all back to the first day he left again. \n\nI\u2019ve written out a dozen messages to my dad about how I don\u2019t want him in my life after this and how much hurt he\u2019s caused us but realistically I know sending it will achieve nothing. I\u2019ve spent the last 3 years rekindling my relationship with my dad just for him to totally neglect me and my brothers emotions about our own dead sibling. Idk where to go from here. I\u2019m so emotionally wound up I can\u2019t focus at work or sleep. My older brother would\u2019ve hated seeing the state I\u2019m in. Idk what to do.",

    "postText": "I started dating my late husband when I was in high school. After I graduated, we moved in together and later got married and had a child. We were together for 12 years when he died from cancer. Our son was 6.\n\nAfter he died, my late husbands family stopped talking to us. One of the worst days of my life was when I asked \u201cgrandma\u201d if we could come visit her and she told me no. She hasn\u2019t talked to me since. I was young when I met my late husband, so I grew up with his family. I saw his parents as my own and I was closer to his grandma than my own grandparents. \n\nI have no friends or family. All of my family was his family and all of my friends were his friend\u2019s wives from high school and college. \n\nI am alone. \n\nBecause of this, I jumped into a relationship sooner than I should have and it\u2019s been about 3 years and I am completely and utterly miserable with him. \n\nI want a divorce, but I\u2019m terrified of being alone. Completely alone. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to be alone. I\u2019ve always had someone.",

            "comment": "I was 18 when I met my late husband.  I went straight from my parents house to living with him.  He moved me all the way across country.  I met all his family and friends but I didn't know anyone there.  I was completely dependent on him.  He moved us every few years so once I started making friends, we were gone and living somewhere else.  He finally moved us out into the boonies of the midwest.  He was a tattoo artist and met lots of people and made lots of friends.  I was a window cleaner and drove around washing windows but not really meeting people.  When he got sick, all his friends promised him they's help me.  When he passed, I never heard from them again.\n\nI was completely alone for the first time ever, at the age of 57.   I was scared to death.  I got a new job, I learned of to take care of things around the house.  I bought a car by myself for the first time, I finished some home repairs and improvements that he started years ago and never completed.  And I realized, I could do this.  \n\nI get lonely sometimes, but not very often.  I'm good with being alone at home.  I'm good with going to lunch/dinner by myself.  I'm great with painting my front door purple, putting in the carpet I like, watching weird foreign programs I couldn't watch before.\n\nBeing alone is kind of awesome.  You can be you 100%",

    "postText": "\n\nWe live in a rural area where all the water comes from each house\u2019s individual water well. These wells cost upwards of $20K to drill. We bought our house about a year ago, and the pump at the bottom of our 200 foot well went out Monday night. \n\nCalled the water well guy, he came and gave us the bad news. Unfortunately his truck that brings up the pipe was getting fixed, so we had to call someone else to come fix it. They were busy but could come yesterday evening. It was going to cost anywhere from $3000-$5000.\n\nMy husband had the day off work (he was on standby for call outs) and he was bored, and decided to watch you tube videos on replacing pumps. He then decides he can fix it with mine and the kids\u2019 help. \n\nHis work truck has a crane on it, so he backed it up to the well house, and we tripped 200 feet of pipe like we\u2019re awesome oilfield drillers. Ok, maybe not that flawlessly- having to slide down the rope and back up to catch the pipe so we don\u2019t lose it down hole- but by God- we pulled all that pipe out, got a new pump from our water guy, wired it up, then sent it all back down home. And it freaking worked!!!! We got our water back last night, and we didn\u2019t screw it up! My husband saved us $5000 at a time we didn\u2019t have it to spare. And the kids are now making jokes about starting our own water well service. My husband is a ballsy, confident man- but in a good way. I\u2019m a lucky woman.",

We found it, lifted the lid, and gently pulled up the tube. The pump was barely hanging on, and we replaced the wire and pump assembly. It was one of my fondest memories because my dad and I were looking through old photos trying to find the pump, and we found a bunch of pictures of my parents before they had kids.",

When we met I was amazed by him - his incredible ability to think outside the square, to fix absolutely anything, to put 100% effort into everything, and not stop until the job is done.\n\nIn our early days he was lamenting over being himself, being a loser compared to my me, family, and all our \u2018typical\u2019 successes (nuclear family, college, business, happy and healthy etc), and I was astonished. I told him I had never met a more functional and successful adult human being, and could he please teach our future children how to behave just like him in life. I remember him getting tears in his eyes, he had no idea.\n\nI wasn\u2019t wrong though, he is an excellent husband and father. He has given our children the family he never had, while teaching them by doing.",

Thanks to Youtube and eBay, we fixed my computer, several light fixtures, the kitchen sink, multiple pairs of expensive glasses, My bong (don't judge me), and even the hood/vent over our stove. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we had hired someone to deal with all of that, they would have charged us double for the part and then $300 just to have someone come look at the stupid thing. My computer was a big one. I just had to change the batter because it got old and burned out basically. The rest of my computer was perfectly fine otherwise. If I had gone to apple they would have given me a hard time about it, charge me way more than the real value of the battery,  and then had me pay for the labor of replacing a battery as if it took all afternoon. (It took 10 minutes and the battery even came with the tools to unscrew the back part).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot of things people can do at home to repair things, but often spend extra money on things because they don't have the confidence or patience to just try and fix it. Even if you don't fix it yourself, it's good to figure out what's wrong with it so people don't try to charge you too much for a basic fix.",

My dad ended up buying a bunch of pipe and equipment to pull the pipe himself, and fashioned a rig that would let you raise it by ratcheting it up manually. Took forever, and luckily we didn't have to redrill anything, but we got to the point we could pull our pipe, replace the pump, and drop it back in by tomorrow's morning. \n\nUnfortunately, we did spend about $4-5k on pumps because we tried to go cheap first, before we bought quality. When it just takes most of a weekend to replace the pump you start seeing it as something you can do every few months when your cheap, used pump fails \"prematurely\".\n\nPulling pipe is tough. Kudos to you guys!",

He's diagnosed and fixed our cars and he's not even a mechanic. He just has knowledge of how things work and enjoys tinkering with stuff. It's saved us so much money.\n\nMy ex husband unfortunately didn't have not one strand of fixing capabilities even with the most basic of tasks and it led to a lot of frustration. I think that's why I find even more pleasure with my now husband's capabilities. \n\nOh and I congratulate you all cause of the family effort. I help my husband just about every time he's fixing something big and I know it's work for you too. But that sense of pride when you turn it on and it works and you think, \"YES! WE did that!\"",

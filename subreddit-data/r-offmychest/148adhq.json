    "postText": "I'm gonna try and keep this short, but there's a lot of details that I'm leaving out because I'd write a damn novel retelling this.\n\nBasically, my dad drove himself into a genuine, movie-level catatonic psychosis because he fell in love with my half sister (his step daughter). He'd nearly killed himself because be wasn't able to eat or drink anything for 3+ weeks due to this. We didn't know at the time of his psychotic episodes, but after the fact he revealed it to my mom when he was still in a very vulnerable headspace (we don't think it was his intention to reveal it, like ever). He destroyed his relationship with my sister, who had seen him as a dad since she was like 14 (she's 41 now).\n\n I tried to stay in contact for a bit after this big blow out, but then I started to think about the fact that if it were my full sister in this situation, I'd honestly probably be in jail for assault, or at the very least I'd have immediately cut contact and been very firm with it. By associating with him and maintaining contact, I was letting him believe what he did was OK.  After cutting contact, I know he has no remorse because he'd often ask me why I wasn't talking with him, what he did wrong, etc even after bringing the whole situation up. He basically denies that he didn't mean \"love\" in that kind of way, but there have been too many things he'd done leading up to this that just made it way too obvious he was just lying.\n\nFeels like shit because I just miss having a normal ass dad, even though he wasn't always the greatest or most attentive, still sucks. Especially with fathers day coming up, there's just always reminders of what he did to our family. Admittedly, I know others have done way worse to others, and maybe I shouldn't cut contact for this? Idk though, anytime I think about the situation I get angry at him, but I also get a bit sad that he has nobody now, and I lost my dad to this whole thing.",

    "postText": "I 14M have had to go through the struggles of a alcoholic father. He would lash out occasionally hit my sister 4F. At one point he even had my step mother at knife point. After he had gotten a DUI with my sister in the car, he had finally stopped drinking and started trying to become a better father. He has started treating everyone so much better as well. I\u2019m happy for him and I feel he\u2019s done such a good job recovering. But I don\u2019t know how much I really forgive him for the stuff he had done. I had seen this man, do drugs, go to jail and everything. I forgave him for all that, but when he was a alcoholic around my sister, something just snapped. I can\u2019t bring myself to forgive him. Since he stopped he is now a changed man who can provide for and love his family. But I don\u2019t know if I can ever forgive him. He was a alcoholic for almost as long as my sisters life. And he got sober when she was 2 1/2. He had gone to therapy and everything. He had apologized, he had treated the family out to places. But I don\u2019t think I can ever forgive him. I feel like shit writing this. I think it\u2019s incredibly petty that I haven\u2019t been able to forgive him but I just don\u2019t know.",

It\u2019s not petty to not forgive.\n\nYou can move forward with someone and still acknowledge what they\u2019ve done *isn\u2019t* okay, and will never be okay, and *that\u2019s okay*. \n\nI hope you and your family can recover from the damage he caused, and I hope he continues to be better for you all.",

He hit your sister who was/is a defenseless baby. I would be mad at him for a long time, too. Those memories don't just disappear once the person gets sober. They still did all those shitty things. Sure, it's good he's getting his life together, but he can't erase the past. I hope he continues to make better choices for you and your family. Don't be upset at yourself. Feel the feelings when they come up. Maybe do something to channel your energy, like working out or something physical. It might help you",

You are NOT a bad person for choosing to not forgive and it is totally okay\n\n3. Do not be hard on yourself and I agree with of the folks commenting that you can truly move forward life and still acknowledge what they did was, is and will not be okay",

            "comment": "My dad has been sober a few years but was an alcoholic throughout my entire childhood. So many things he has said or did during that time affect me to this day. I have panic attacks if any man raises his voice at me thanks to him. He is sober now and tries to be a good dad, but I feel you. It\u2019s a mix of \u201cI hate you\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re my dad and I love you\u201d and I have not been able to express it in a better way than that. I don\u2019t know if I forgive him, and I don\u2019t even know if forgiveness will make me feel better. Forgiveness doesn\u2019t take away my trauma, but I want to believe my dad is a better man now. Maybe I\u2019ll feel different in a few years but who knows.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to forgive him. Forgiveness is for YOU not for him. It\u2019s okay to not have a solid answer. Feelings are a mixed bag and hard to define sometimes. You are not alone in this situation or in your feelings.",

If forgiving him doesn't feel right then it's probably not right.  If he's truly changed, then hopefully that means he won't hurt anyone in the future.  But that doesn't mean he's deserving of any kind of forgiveness.  The trauma he's inflicted will always be there and no amount of remorse will change that.\n\nTake care of yourself, please.",

Tell the people who care about you that you will be going offline, but for others don't even bother. \nIf peolpe don't contact you, you don\u2019t have to try to contact them back. That way you won't be feeling ignored and forgotten. It is better to have quality friends than a quantity of friends who don't care about you.",

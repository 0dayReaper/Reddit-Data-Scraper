    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019ve never really written my whole story and before I go I wanted to have someone remember who I was, even if it\u2019s a series of anonymous redditors. This is going to be a long read and I apologize in advance.\n\nI was born into a wealthy family in managment of a household corporation from the part of the world I was originally from (East Asia). My father was a cruel man who often abused my mother and I ferociously. Despite all his shortcomings, he tried to groom me into becoming a good man who would one day lead the company he built from nothing. As the years dragged on his health declined.\n\nWhen I was twelve, he passed away and it was said he worked himself to death. Flying between America and Korea mustn\u2019t have been easy for him as he often seemed ill especially during the finals few months of his life. \n\nIn the years after my father\u2019s passing, my mother took on the role of shaping me into a future corporate leader by having me educated at the best schools in America. Those years were hell for me as everyday I missed my home and all the friends I\u2019ve left behind in my home. However, despite despising school, I made good marks and was moderately received by my teachers. \n\nFor my final year of high school as I was slotted to graduate early, I requested to be transferred to a sister school across the country. That\u2019s when I met the only person I\u2019ve ever loved. She was a student at the school, an underclassman and a scholarship student of my nationality. Despite what my culture would\u2019ve perceived as shortcomings, such as her family status, I loved her. Till this day she is the kindest person I\u2019ve ever met in my life and one of a few people who truly wants to be my friend for me.\n\nEventually I worked up the courage to ask her to date me and she agreed, much to my surprise. Much of the school didn\u2019t approve of our relationship due to manifestations of elitist culture and how judgmental people can be when it comes to appearances. I thought I was going to live out my life happy with her much like in those Korean dramas I\u2019ve always considered silly.\n\nMy dreams of an ideal romance was shattered when I was diagnosed with a terminal disease. At the time of diagnosis I had four months left, now most of that time has passed as I\u2019ve attempted to continue a life of normalcy with increasing failing attempts at covering my poor health. My cough no longer passable as a cold, my limp no longer concealable as a sore leg, I can no longer maintain the pretense that everything is alright. \n\nAs I realized how much pain she would\u2019ve been in had I passed away, I ended my relationship with her abruptly, without explanation. She was hurt, as to be expected, but I reasoned she\u2019d be better off without the burden of my death on her. If nothing else, she deserves better than me as I cannot be there for her much longer. \n\nNow at the end of my life, I\u2019m coming to reflect on all the things I wish I could\u2019ve done differently, as many others have done before me. Yet, I find little I would\u2019ve changed because now that I\u2019m in the ninth inning, as my username suggests, I\u2019ve arrived at the realization life is simply a set of cards dealt by the universe in which there is no order. The universe is neither good nor bad, it\u2019s apathetic and uncaring. Nearing the end, I\u2019ll die alone as my mother is now preoccupied with raising my brother to replace me an ocean away. I don\u2019t mind it, as my parents have never truly been together with me. \n\nWith death imminent, I\u2019ve considered professing my belief in a higher power but that would be a lie. Never in my life have I believed in the existence of a supreme being who is responsible for life. I shall die as I\u2019ve lived, by myself, save for a short amount of time that I\u2019ve been lucky enough to spend with her. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read to this point I would like to say thank you, and I\u2019ll miss you, even if I\u2019ve never met you before. Maybe I\u2019ll be proven wrong and there is something greater than us out there. In that case I\u2019ll look forward to seeing her again, someday. \n\nThank you and farewell\n-Anonymous",

Get back to your friend and let her know why you leaving her, you already dying from a disease do you also want to die on the inside, at least spend the last week you have with the person you love the most instead of dying by yourself. I'm only saying this because I would hate to die by myself so I don't want it to happen to you and you will have her for the last time and you will feel the love of someone who appreciate you being in their life. I seriously am sorry for what is happening to you and I hope you do what makes happy even for one week. I truly am sorry brother.",

Not sure what I\u2019m getting at but I\u2019m sorry you have to go through this. Also consider the way your ex feels, she may feel shitty for the rest of her life not being there for you through this, whether you give her a choice or not. It\u2019s much easier to accept loss of a loved one when you see it with your own two eyes. Might feel kinda nice at least having someone there for you your last few days.",

She said she'd try anal play but wasn't sure... a couple months later we were in bed and she was embarrassed. I asked her what was up and she said 'I didn't know I'd like it so much. Is it weird if I want it all the time?' \n\nNo, babe. We'll figure it out. \n\nBut really, if you're careful and attentive... there's just too many nerve endings there to ignore during sex.",

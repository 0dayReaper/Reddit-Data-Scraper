    "postText": "Hi everyone. I\u2019ve had a not-so-great relationship with my dad over the years and unfortunately I still live with him (and can\u2019t move for awhile). Honestly I can\u2019t stand to be around him and it\u2019s hard to hide. He\u2019s done things in the past that I\u2019ll never forget (mostly having to do with his drinking/anger issues) and he\u2019s been trying to be better the last year and a half. Trying not to be as much of a dick, drink less, letting me have more freedom with friends, not constantly bringing his kids down, not yelling as much, etc. \n\nBut there are things he\u2019s said that I just can\u2019t let go of. Every time I\u2019ve thought he\u2019s gotten better, one little thing he says/does will set me off and make me hate him as much as I did before he started \u201ctrying.\u201d He seems to expect all of us to just forgive him and forget about the past but he\u2019s honestly been a piece of shit to his family (including me) for too long for that to happen.\n\nI don\u2019t see my relationship with him getting better so I\u2019ve given up trying. He seems to always have a tone when he answers me (like if I ask a simple question, he\u2019ll act like I\u2019m a dumbass for even talking to him) so I respond the same way. He acts like he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me and I do the same. Earlier he called me out on how my \u201cfacial things\u201d (expressions) don\u2019t go unnoticed. He\u2019d just shushed me and told me to be quiet because my little brother is in bed. I was talking at a normal volume super far from his room so instead of arguing, I kept quiet but my face showed that I had something to say. I\u2019ve always had a problem with that, especially with him. I can\u2019t hide how I feel. It\u2019s so, so difficult when it seems like everything he says pisses me off. \n\nHe says I get offended at everything and that he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me because I\u2019m always defensive with him. Gee, I wonder why. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s overreacted over the littlest shit in the past so I don\u2019t know what\u2019ll set him off. It\u2019s true that I\u2019m defensive, I don\u2019t know how not to be with him but he\u2019ll never understand that. It has to be something wrong with me, not him. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve recently gotten into a relationship and if there\u2019s anything my dad is crazy about, it\u2019s respect and trust. I\u2019ve been sneaking to my bf\u2019s house for some time now because my dad was pissed at me for getting into my last relationship. Tried to make everything difficult for me and encouraged me to break up with her (because of things HE did at my age), limited our time together as much as he could, claimed I was disrespectful for sneaking around and hiding shit bc I didn\u2019t tell him we were dating until 3 weeks later (I was scared of what his reaction might be and rightfully so). \n\nMy brother has since gotten into a relationship and my dad is EXTREMELY lenient in comparison. Congratulated him,  didn\u2019t get mad that my brother didn\u2019t mention already dating her for a month, encouraged him every step along the way. He treats me differently because I\u2019m his daughter so I worry that his lack of strictness won\u2019t transfer to my relationship as much as my brother\u2019s. \n\nI\u2019d also like to mention that I was in a lesbian relationship and my dad grew up very religious and homophobic, so this could be a part of why he was so against my relationship at first. But I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s better that I\u2019m with a guy this time. I\u2019ve been on birth control for two years now but I know he doesn\u2019t want to think that his \u201clittle girl\u201d is growing up and being sexual. \n\nIdk. I\u2019m just so worried to tell him but I also don\u2019t want to get caught in my lies (being alone with my bf at his place rather than with other friends). I\u2019ll be seeing my guy tomorrow morning and I\u2019ll be back home before my dad gets home from work, but i worry that he\u2019ll look back at camera footage (he uses it to see Amazon packages on the porch lol) and see that I was gone for hours and didn\u2019t specifically ask or tell him where I\u2019ve been. I\u2019ll let my other family members know to say I was with friends but I just have a lot of anxiety about this. \n\nI don\u2019t want him to freak out or limit the time I have with my bf but I also don\u2019t want him to find out I\u2019ve been sneaking. I could try to start rekindling our relationship (aka act like I don\u2019t hate him and pretend to be interested in what he likes or says) but it\u2019s so difficult. I know that having a strained relationship with my dad already will make it harder to tell him about my boyfriend. It\u2019s just so hard to pretend. \n\nThank you for reading if you got this far. Any advice would be appreciated.",

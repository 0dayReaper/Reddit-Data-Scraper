    "postText": "I really want to help my son pass a hair follicle drug test.  He only ever smokes weed no other drugs. He has to take a test in 2 weeks because his father is trying to gain full custody of his 2 older children 6 and 5. He has a 2 year old with a different partner and they have no interest in taking this grandchild. My sons father did the same thing when my 3 sons were little,  making up a whole fabrication of lies to gain custody.  I had my 4th son with my partner/husband but that didn't ever come into the equasion.  I left my sons father because of his physical and mental abuse. He was convicted for domestic violence and threatening to kill with a deadly weapon.  None of this matterd to the family courts and they gave him custody.  So here we are now history repeating itself.  Yes my son smokes weed recreationaly,  he was brought up with it. His father is a pot head! I cant let him get custody of these babies. My son is an amazing father and provider. His partner is the best mum you could ever ask for.  The children's biological mother also supports my son in having the children,  she only wants visitation which is something that my sons father has taken away from her. Theres so much more i could tell about the history and whats happening now. But if theres anyone that has any advice on how he can pass this test in 2 weeks you would be our saviors. He has quit cold turkey so not smoking anymore!",

    "postText": "So to start, in high school, everybody knew I was gay. It wasn't because I came out but because I had a crush on this guy and then this guy told the whole school about it and that's how it spread out there.\n\nThen, I met this guy called Ricardo, in high school, which was new in our school and neighborhood, through my best friend, since they were from the same class. I disliked him at first because he was friends with my crush and that made me jealous and he knew I didn't like him. But the truth is that I was starting to think about Ricardo more and more as time passed.\n\nOne day, during vacation, I went for a walk and I saw him walking his dog. We used to live near each other before he moved.\n\nI ignored him and walk past him but he called me saying he wanted to talk to me about why I disliked him so much and that he didn't any bad blood with anyone now that he wanted to start a fresh start in his new home. So he told me to go to his house... and I went cause it's the below.\n\nI told him by sms the whole situation and he understood it, surprisingly, he asked if I wanted to be his friend since I didn't have many friends. But he didn't want to be seen with me in public because I was gay and his friends would make fun of him for that. So we met ONLY out of school. When no one could see us\n\nWhen I went to his house, we started getting along, and we had fun. And I started to fall for him. He opened up about his mother who passed away due to cancer, about his father who's very narcissistic and abusive, and his stepmother that doesn't care about him and is just like the father.\n\nThat's when he took the conversation to which type of guys I liked and things got weird. When I wasn't expecting it, he kissed me and said he was interested in me for a while. He wanted to be friends with benefits and I, who didn't know what was that, accepted anyway.\n\nHe only wanted my body. Only wanted me to have sex. He treated me like a toy so that we could be satisfied. He said that since his mother died he wanted some affection. I had my first time with him and that's when I fell for him completely. Then I was living in the hope that he would like me the same way I like him. He even gave me hope that we could maybe be together in the future.\n\nBut he revealed to be very toxic and cruel. When he was angry, he took everything on me. Made me cry a lot and he didn't give a shit. He yelled at me even when I cried, saying I was a shitty person, that his friends are more special than me, that he wouldn't miss me when he moved out to another place, that I was sick and needed help, and that he would call the cops and accuse me of harassment if he saw me again.\n\nHe even said I was like his father. That I was just as worse as his father: abusive, manipulative, etc... And then I'm like \"What if he's right?\"\n\nHe just said the most cruel things to me. I sometimes believe in his words. I sometimes think that people shouldn't date me, that there are better people out there than me. Sometimes I wish I never met him.\n\nI saw him on Grindr recently and I got hurt knowing he is seeing other guys and that he forgot about me completely while I'm still here thinking about him. I sent him a message and he blocked me.\n\nIf he doesn't like me, it's okay, I respect it. If he never seeing me again will make him happy, then I will do that. I will try to move on. And focus on myself instead. But it hurts a lot. It's been 2 years and I can't get over him and the way he treated me. I guess I never will.\n\nSorry for the long text but I decided to vent everything here cause I don't have money for a therapist haha\n\nEdit: Do you guys know the song August by Taylor Swift? That song describes the situation really well (I'm Augustine).",

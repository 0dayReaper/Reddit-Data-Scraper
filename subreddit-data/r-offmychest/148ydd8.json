    "postText": "This month has been the worst month of my life. And it all stared when my mom got evicted and I had to leave with her. Now were staying at my best friends house. I wasn't evicted but I couldn't leave my mom alone so I left with my mom. So now were living in a one bedroom and sleeping in the same bed.  My work commute used to be 3 minutes, now its 40 minutes each way. I used to see my sister everyday, I haven't seen her in days cause she didnt want to come with us and stayed with her father. Not to mention I found out I made a mistake on two MISL forms at work and now I feel like I cant do my job properly. Happy 28th birthday to me.",

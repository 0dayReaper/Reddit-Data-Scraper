    "postText": "(nsfw for the shower part)\n(17M) it happened a few years ago, to the point where I was yelled at and called names and occasionally being grabbed/hit almost every day. On two occasions he spanked me me while I was naked, trying to get into the shower. He would videotape me too, especially when I was upset from his treatment and he would humiliate me by making me watch it back. \n\nI always tried to stick up for my younger brother (15M atm) because I didn\u2019t want him to share the same experiences like I did. I\u2019d lie to our dad to keep the blame on me even though my brother never got yelled at or anything, and then when I was around 16 I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I told my mom about how I was being treated and she said I don\u2019t have to go over there anymore, but even though my dad let me leave he made a huge deal about my brother staying- he yelled and tried to get us both to stay but my brother ended up deciding to stay. (my brother ended up getting out about 1 1/2 years ago maybe I can\u2019t remember.)\nNow we both live with our mom since he died. \n\nI was on instagram and saw my brother liked this sad video/meme type format about the older sibling leaving the abusive household and the younger one being left. And I cried that night because I felt like shit for what I did, even though we were treated so much differently I know it wasn\u2019t easy for him and I wish I could\u2019ve told him it\u2019s okay for him to move out too. But I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m a shitty brother for leaving him with our dad.",

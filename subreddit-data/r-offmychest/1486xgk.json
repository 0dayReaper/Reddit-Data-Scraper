    "postText": "\nI\u2019m using a throwaway because I can\u2019t handle anything negative. There have been so many big changes in our lives that I\u2019ve just been rolling with the punches, the main one being my partner taking her life at the beginning of the month. My family didn\u2019t support our relationship. We were \u201cjust playing house\u201d together which is such a hurtful thing to hear because Kate is my kids momma. Blood doesn\u2019t make a bond. \n\n\nI\u2019ve been strong and kept it together in front of my kids. I was strong when my daughter told me she wished I had died instead of her dad while we were in line waiting to look through donated clothes because everything is \u201chigh waters or too short on her\u201d and she gets made fun of. I was strong when I had to tell my son he couldn\u2019t participate in summer camp this year even though I would get a discounted rate, I still can\u2019t swing it. I know my kids don\u2019t really wish I died, they are grieving. Yet, I still roll with the emotional punches and do my best. \n\n\nToday I was talking with my son about turning 13 in three days. He knows there will be no party and no presents. I\u2019m grateful he understands. He seems to believe me when I tell him that I will make it up to him when I can. He handed me a phone number that his bus driver gave him on the last day of school for a food pantry.  He told me it\u2019s a special one because it has fresh veggies, fruit, meat, and treats. He asked me to call them to see if it was true. I don\u2019t know why this makes me so emotional. I\u2019m thinking about how he was holding onto the number just waiting for me to say something about his birthday. This was going to be his solution to get what he wants for his birthday. \n\n\nWhat 13 year old is excited about getting ground beef as a present? He wanted me to mention it was his birthday so that they would maybe give us extra milk for his cereal.  He said he would even walk to pick it up so we don\u2019t waste gas. He was so excited. I called the pantry but it\u2019s now closed for the month because they are out of donations already. \n\n\nAfter I told him they didn\u2019t have anything but that we could try back in a week he got really upset and went to shower. My daughter was getting teary eyed and asked if she could go collect cans from the parking lots nearby. In our state cans have a deposit on them as an incentive to return and not litter. Now I\u2019m sitting here wondering how on earth I let my life get so pathetic that I don\u2019t have even a dollar in my bank account with a full time job. I\u2019m debating calling into work to help my daughter all day tomorrow to collect cans. I feel like the worst father in the world.",

You're not the worst father by far, you love your kids and they know that. It's a hard time for all of you, but please don't be afraid of asking for help or support wherever you can",

Being there for them might be a thankless task, at least until they're a little older, so I want to say: thank you. One stranger to another, thank you for doing everything in your power to protect and care for your children. No matter what, you're doing the right thing by trying.",

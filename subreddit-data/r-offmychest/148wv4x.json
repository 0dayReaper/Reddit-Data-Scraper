    "postText": "This is something I've been thinking about for years, and it's been crushing me. First, some context.\n\nMy friend group in middle school was small, only comprised of me  and 5 other people. We were your typical weird kids. We listened to emo music, were either autistic, adhd, and/or had another mental illness, and were LGBTQ+. We were constantly being harrassed and bullied by the other kids and were the main targets of the entire grade. We were all really close, but I was closest with two girls in the group, I'll call them Tina and Alex. \nHowever, my friend group was extremly toxic. One member of my group would hit me and at one point scratched me so deep it left a scar. Another would FaceTime me covered in her own blood after cutting herself. I felt trapped, since everyone depended on me as the \"therapist friend\" and since I would have no friends if I left the group. My only escape was my theater school outside of town.\nWhen 8th grade was coming to a close, I begged my mom to send me to high school outside of my home town so I could be free of the abuse from my peers and my friend group. Thankfully, she said yes and I would be attending the high school all my theater friends went to. However, I didn't fully escape the torment of my friends.\nI blocked everyone on social media and their numbers except Tina and Alex. They were the only ones in the group I fully trusted. Tina was also attending high school out of town, and Alex was staying at our towns high school. My freshman year was really rough mentally, since I had to make all new friends and I had been forced to stop taking my ADHD medication due to health concerns, so my school struggles returned. \nOne day I was texting Alex and we started fighting. She was yelling at me saying I was selfish and wrong for abandoning our group and blocking everyone. I told her I was sorry, and explained how rough my mental health has been, and once I felt better I would reach out to everyone and explain better. However, she didn't accept that. She told me I didn't have it as rough as I thought I did and that she was planning on killing herself, and it was all my fault. I panicked and ran to the counselors office and told her about Alex's texts and explained I was scared she would actually take her life. The counselor called Alex's school, and thankfully she was at school. \nThe next day I woke up to spam from Alex and Tina, telling me I was a horrible person and that Alex had been joking. They sent me messages telling me to kill myself and that they hated me. But somehow I knew in my heart Alex hadn't been lying. I can't explain it. \nI never reconciled with my old friend group, but I do hope everyone's ok. It's been almost 5 years and part of me is happy I might have saved Alex's life, but at the same time I made everything worse with the two people I thought had my back. After Tina told me to kill myself, I attempted to drown myself that same afternoon, but something stopped me from going through with it. No one even knows that part.\nSorry this is so long, I just needed to finally admit I wished something horrible.",

The only right thing to do is believe someone when they cry for help, especially as a minor going to a trusted adult. You did good.  \n\nAnd it\u2019s better that you don\u2019t speak with any of them anymore. Those two were as abusive as the rest of the group. Do your best to let it go. I hope you\u2019re in a better place now \ud83d\udc97",

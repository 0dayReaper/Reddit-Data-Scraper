    "postText": "I quit my job today and I don't feel very good about it. I joined a company as a fresher exactly a month ago since I was promised that I would be trained and would learn things but things took a turn once I started. The offer letter I had recieved didn't mention timings, the pay schedule nor the leave structure basically the things any employment letter/contract would need. At first I didn't think too much about it since it said that I would be on probation for 3 months, I expected a detailed contract much later. But gradually I came to realise that none of their systems were in place, nobody was there to guide me and if I asked questions I would recieve vague responses that didn't make much sense. \n\nThe remote setting didn't help either and I felt so alone. So today after a month of working here I called my employer and said that I wanted to leave. I didn't think too much about it since I haven't received any contract saying that I couldn't do it but my employer called me unprofessional and cut the call without much of a conversation. \n\nSo I submitted a resignation letter and just didn't pick up their calls after that. I feel really terrible about this since I didn't really want to burn bridges this way but I couldn't really continue here with all this chaos. And I do feel unprofessional by not responding to their messages, I've muted my phone. But I don't think I can talk to them after this and it's not like I've signed a contract nor have I been paid. \n\nAnyway I just wanted to share since it's been eating me up all day. I feel absolutely terrible. I'm worried that they'll do something horrible to my career, maybe stop me from joining other places or something but my friends and family say that they can't really do anything since I wasn't there for long in the first place. It's still eating me up though.",

            "comment": "I think you did everything absolutely right. It took a lot of courage for you to tell your employer that\u2019s you wanted to leave. This job did not offer what you were hoping and promised it would evolve into. You didn\u2019t receive proper guidance and there wasn\u2019t a professional structure in place. Do not feel bad about quitting and don\u2019t even listen to your employer calling you unprofessional. The fact you were there a month and nothing got better for your work is reflection on them. Not you. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you find a better job that you deserve.",

    "postText": "I work in social services. I have a hybrid schedule where I go Into the office twice a week for in person meetings, And I work remotely the rest of the time. Except because of how busy I am and because of the size of my case load, I often have to go into the Office on my remote days anyway to accommodate my clients; at least once a week.\n\nToday was one of those days. I worked through my lunch with the flexibility of going home an hour early. I made this clear in my voice mail. I had several calls, meetings, and other obligations like I usually do. I'm constantly busy. So sometimes I leave my phone on silent and send people to voice mail. If I get the opportunity to call back same day I do. I have up to 48 hrs to call back.\n\nSomeone called during another meeting earlier today. They called again literally as I was packing up - past my stated leave time. I listened to the message. It wasn't an emergency necessarily, but it was a bit stressful for them. They wanted a call back same day. I didn't call back. I left, a bit later than scheduled.\n\nI feel bad for listening to the message and not calling back. I feel bad I couldn't get back to them earlier. I feel bad that I'm so stretched thin that I can't just *be* the superhuman my clients expect me to be. I get a lot of kind compliments from my clients about how much they appreciate me. I don't think they know how hot I'm burning on both ends. And a lot of the time it never feels like enough. That's my own thing, though.\n\nI guess I just feel more burnt today.",

Sure, they were stressed, but so are you.\n\nAnd i know saying all of that probably doesnt alleviate the feeling bad about it. But maybe it helps anyway to hear it:)",

    "postText": "(Throw away post because I just wanted to say this somewhere and couldn't really figure out where to say it.) \n\nI'm so in love. I'm in love with my partner, here I am on call a video call and I'm watching them play with dolls. Dolls. The doll that make  them smile and laugh. That make them  happy and proud. Them telling me about how they style their dolls how they smile while playing with them makes my heart warm. It makes me proud that they've come so far. So far. From everything.\n\nTheir father. A terrible man tore them down and I wanted to build them again. Make them whole again. For almost 4 years. I've spent time understanding. Helping and building them into the most perfect thing in my world (not making them for me helping them for themselves.) I'm so glad were engaged. I'm so glad were in love. Words couldn't describe how I feel when it comes to them. I look forward for our future. I look forward to seeing them. I can't wait to hug them. To kiss them to hold them in my arms. I'm so in love with them. I'm so in love.",

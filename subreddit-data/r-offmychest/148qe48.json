    "postText": "Before you read this and go to the comments all \u201coh you do it to you don\u2019t have anything to say!\u201d Blah blah blah, I\u2019m not angry or dissapointed or any of that with my mother. I\u2019m just\u2026confused.\n\nThe other day, I was at my friends house and everyone in her family smokes. That\u2019s known. We were talking about a bunch of stuff and I forget how, but eventually she said that my mom bought edibles from her mom. Her mom had a few extra on hand and was looking for them apperantly saying that they were for someone else, and she told me that when she asked who they were for, her mom told her that she was selling my mom edibles.\n\nI have no idea how to feel about this.\n\nI know I do it too and I don\u2019t blame her or anything but it feels like I have to rethink who she is entirely. The woman I\u2019ve known as my mother for so many years feels like a complete stranger now. I never, Never in my life wouldve thought she would have done drugs of any sort, but now that I know she has or is going to, I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m feeling. I\u2019m just very, very confused. It feels like she has a whole other personality that she hides from me.\n\nI love my mom, and always will, I just don\u2019t know how to react. I never expected her to do something like this.",

Also yes, edibles are drugs, just as much as alcohol and cigarettes are. Just because they aren\u2019t quite as bad or negative doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t drugs. But also if someone\u2019s talking about personal shit that feels important to them how about you give sone actually helpful input and contribute to their post rather than just one: say something that\u2019s simply not true and two: say something that you have no idea about and could seriously fuck with someone\u2019s mood, yeah?",

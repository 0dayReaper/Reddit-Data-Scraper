    "postText": "I\u2019ve had repressed memories resurface since the middle of last year, but I\u2019ve been dealing with painful flashbacks since the beginning of this year. It\u2019s already halfway through the year, and it hasn\u2019t stopped. Everything\u2019s changed.\n\nThe other night I was crying and apologizing to no one. The nerves in my back felt like they were on fire. I felt so much shame. Every time it gets intense I always think, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being a bad kid.\u201d and \u201cWhat could I have done as a kid to deserve this?\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t know who could\u2019ve done it. I only have a vague idea of the event and perpetrator. The only \u201cproof\u201d I have are the PTSD-like symptoms I\u2019ve been having. The hallucinations would get so bad to the point that it feels like there\u2019s someone next to or behind me.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to end this post, but thanks if you read this.",

I forget exactly what it's called, and it's incredibly uncomfortable and downright painful at times, but in the end it *can* help. My PTSD nightmares have almost entirely stopped since I went through it, and I haven't lashed out at anyone in a PTSD-related way in a few years now.\n\nBut you should know, it is not and was not ever your fault.",

    "postText": "I just saw a dead body that had been torn to pieces on the highway on my way to work, traffic was crawling by and I shouldn't have looked but I did. \nI'm honestly really fucked up right now. My job is talking to people and being scheduled and organized and right now I feel shell shocked and off my game. I had someone I cared about die in a bad accident a long time back (wasnt there, just heard what happened) and now I'm playing that on loop in my head with what I saw. Clearly I'm not ok if I'm trauma dumping this to strangers on the Internet.\nI'm debating calling out of work but I'm already here. I don't know how or what to do.\n\nWill delete in a few hours. I won't be giving specifics past here there and everywhere as a phrase you could use.\n\nEdit: holy crap this got more attention that I thought.\nTo all the wonderful people who have said kind things. Thank you. It's exceptionally appreciated. \n\nI did have a therapist recently who I stopped seeing due to the practice closing. But I think this is a good reason to reach back out so I will be seeking at least a session or two about this amd hopefully more so thank you. \n\nI did find out a little more about the victim amd honestly I wish I hadnt. My GF was in the car with me this morning and I have been checking on her and she has a therapist she sees weekly. \n\nThank you.",

I promise taking care of yourself is more important then work right now if you feel this bad. Call someone you love. Just let them know that you're not feeling so good and could they ring you back in a couple hours to check on you. You're going to be ok friend.",

No job is worth suffering over but I understand if you don\u2019t have the means to simply walk away and risk termination. Having someone close to you die in such a way is traumatic whether you were there or not and could develop into mild ptsd. Seeing something triggering like that would absolutely cause distress if you have ptsd or if you are still grieving. \n\nWould you be able to leave work if you said something came up and you were unwell enough to keep working? Or if your job isn\u2019t known to be understanding you could possibly say you need to call in what you saw so no one sees it or maybe you could say you need to drop by to make a statement. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to see that, I can only imagine how you feel.",

These sorts of things can and do unfortunately happen, and because we like to think it should not. These things really do faze us as people. Worse, you already have preexisting trauma to now match this too. So, yes, maybe see a therapist too.\n\nGet talking about it to someone you trust. Do not let this fester, these things have a strange way of staying with you. It is natural and a self preservation, a way to avoid something we do not want to happen to us. \n\nI was told many years ago, that a RTA death will be the most traumatic death you ever deal with. Someone gets shot, we know it will happen and it sucks, but we all know what happens when you are shot. Even if you never see it first hand, we have all seen it in the movies. RTA's are different. We all get in our cars and drive from A-B every day, it is so safe we let 90% of people do it. When that fails and breaks down, the horror of what is really about us so plainly and how we willingly we all entrust our lives to these metal beasts will be scary and if not worked past, could leave lasting problems.

I remember being on my way to school in the early morning when the car driving in front of me tried to switch to the left lane. As he got over the car that was parallel to me in the left lane, he sped up and rear-ended the man switching lanes. \n\nWe were going about 60mph. The man was ejected through his windshield and landed all the way over on the right side, four lanes over on the opposite side of traffic. I got out of my car to catch my breath, and people were panicking and screaming for me to do CPR. I was only 2 months into my nursing program but was pretty adamant that the victim in no way, shape, or form was surviving that. The guy that hit him was in an old Geo-Metro and had the hood and frame of his car smashed all the way up to the steering wheel. He was as pale as a sheet, with blood pouring from his face. He screamed for people to help him, but I told the others to leave him for fear that the car may have been the only thing keeping him together. I called EMR and was pretty badly shaken up. \n\nWhen EMR and the police arrived, I tried to wave down an officer to let him know that I had been an eyewitness, and the asshole had the audacity to say, \"Calm down, you\u2019ll be able to get to where you\u2019re going soon enough.\" Before I could even get a word in edgewise. Flustered and crying, I just got in my car and drove off. I turned around and called out from school that day. The PTSD from that day stayed with me for three years. I couldn\u2019t drive without my hands and legs violently shaking for like 2 years. So I get it. Just try to take it day by day.",

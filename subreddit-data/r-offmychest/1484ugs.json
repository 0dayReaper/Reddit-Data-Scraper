    "postText": "I love my boyfriend so much and he does everything he can to be there and support me , with that being said, he is so unhealthy. My boyfriend is overweight not by a lot but he eats really poorly always. The worst habit he has though is he won\u2019t brush his teeth and it\u2019s so upsetting because he gets mad when I try to be nice about it and remind him. I am supposed to be living with him soon and i\u2019m afraid his health is not important to him but I feel like it\u2019s not my business.",

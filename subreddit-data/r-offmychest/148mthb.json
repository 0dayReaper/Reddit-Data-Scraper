    "postText": "Anytime I mess up, big or small, my boyfriend sits there for 5 minutes plus talking about how much I messed up, how could I be so stupid, so on and so forth. When I hang up, I\u2019m acting like a child. When I get upset and say I\u2019m done being talked to like that, I\u2019m abusive and he\u2019s allowed to be upset. I just feel like we have incredibly good times but more and more lately it\u2019s been like this.",

            "comment": "Yea, this is a red flag. Nobody needs to listen to that. If you mess up, fine. Acknowledge it and move on. Does he mess up? Would he take kindly to you harping on it and calling him stupid. I doubt it. In fact, I\u2019d be willing to bet he wouldn\u2019t want you to say a damn word about it. Everyone messes up here and there. I do it daily. Can I ask for some examples?",

There\u2019s a bit of a language barrier but I told the person they can\u2019t turn the bathtub on. When I left to pick my son up, they cleaned that bathroom and turned it on causing it to leak everywhere downstairs and on the floor. I called to tell him what happened and it was 5 minutes on how this is my fault, he almost said something but thought surely I wouldn\u2019t be so stupid to let it happen, he should be able to rely on me, so on and so forth for 5 minutes. I finally hung up. Then he\u2019s calling me 20+ until I answer and it\u2019s another 5 minutes of the same plus how I\u2019m a child for hanging up and he wouldn\u2019t have to treat me like a child if I didn\u2019t act like one. Finally hung up and didn\u2019t answer this time. Now blowing up my phone with texts and \u201cit\u2019s okay though lol silly you. Just a little whoopsie\u201d",

Harping on the situation, name calling, belittling you, and talking to you in a condescending manner is not ok! You\u2019re suppose to be his partner not his child!! I suggest some couples counseling! He needs to see this behavior is not ok nor is it ok to teach your son to do it!!",

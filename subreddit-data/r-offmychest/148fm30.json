    "postText": "I (49f) was recently diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea. I don\u2019t want a cpap machine, &amp; the very thought of one fills me with rage. But apparently I don\u2019t get a choice. \nI never would have mentioned my snoring to my doctor but my boyfriend of 13 years really wanted me to get it checked. I don\u2019t feel like there is anything wrong with my sleep. I usually feel fine when I get up. I have always been an early riser.  My mom would even cover my windows when I was little. If I saw sunlight, I was up. Therefore I was always an early to bed person too. I was never a night owl. \nThe questionnaire my boyfriend &amp; I had to fill out asked the dumbest questions like if I ever fall asleep riding in the car. Well sometimes we\u2019re driving home late &amp; I fall asleep. Do you fall asleep watching tv? Well yeah, if I\u2019m trying to stay up late to finish what I\u2019m watching. Who doesn\u2019t? My boyfriend crashes on the couch every single night we\u2019re home between 9-10. Which is way more often than I do. I have always snored. Even when I was 18, in the army &amp; in the best shape of my life. \nI did an at home test. These tests are ridiculous. You strap a device to yourself with hoses &amp; cords you have to attach to your body. Then go to sleep. Right! I was told to make sure the cords &amp; hoses don\u2019t get disconnected- WHILE I WAS SUPPOSE TO BE SLEEPING!!!  Well I slept like sh!t that night. I kept waking up over &amp; over again throughout the night to check the wires. How can my results be accurate? Again the stupidity of those that do these tests expecting a sleeping person to do things while trying to get a decent night\u2019s sleep and get proper test results. \nThen I had to go to the local hospital to do an overnight sleep study. I thought I had to go in because the previous test was a bust. Found out at this test, that it was to determine what kind of machine I would be getting. WAIT!!! WHAT?!?! I didn\u2019t know I had been diagnosed with anything, let alone having a stupid machine forced on me. Then she asked me if I breathed through my nose or mouth when I slept. I DON\u2019T KNOW! I\u2019M ASLEEP! Soooo many stupid questions!!! Then she attaches me to a ton of wires &amp; hoses &amp; a microphone. Then puts the torture device on me. First we tried a mask with the hose attached to the top of my head. Supposedly the best &amp; most comfortable option. She really pushed this one. The mask has to be sealed. So it is tight. It felt like someone put my face in a vice grip. Hurt so bad I almost cried. She &amp; I talked about the tightness but she implied it wouldn\u2019t work if it wasn\u2019t so tight. Usually I fall asleep fairly quick. Not this night. I\u2019m supposed to be able to move normally &amp; comfortably with this equipment. Not a freaking chance. \nAfter a few hours, she comes in because I\u2019m not sleeping. We try a different mask. I can tell she doesn\u2019t think this one is as good. The hose is attached to the nose/mouth piece. The nasal holes were in the wrong place &amp; actually blocked my nostrils. Gee! I wonder why it said I had breathing problems? She told me if I didn\u2019t fall asleep soon, I\u2019d have to come back &amp; redo the test. Not a chance in Hell was I ever coming back. \nNothing like massive stress &amp; pressure to induce sleep. I tried to get as comfortable as I could with hundreds of wires, cords &amp; hoses attached to me, plus a ridiculously uncomfortable face mask. I tried to lay on my side like I usually do but my mask kept moving &amp; pressurized air would shoot straight into my eyes. Very helpful. I counted backwards from 100 multiple times, tried to relax my body the best I could. I also had a stuffy nose, which I often do. She said she turned up the humidifier part for that issue.  Still I couldn\u2019t blow my nose to clear it. So how does that help? Spoiler alert, it doesn\u2019t. Choking on snot is I guess a good thing. I also tried to scratch my itchy nose. Can\u2019t do that! Again not helpful to falling asleep. It was determined that I am a mouth breather in my sleep. So I need a whole face mask. Through all of this, I somehow managed to \u201csleep\u201d enough for the study. I don\u2019t believe it &amp; that is also part of why I think this whole process is a scam.\nNext thing I know, I\u2019m being contacted about someone setting me up with my machine. Once again, I was thinking WAIT!!! WHAT?!?! Was I even diagnosed with anything? Is no one going to go over the tests results &amp; explain my options? Except for this stupid sleep study process, I have loved everything else about my primary care physician. I guess I was stupid for thinking I would have a conversation about this with some medical professional. But apparently they just shove you through a process with a predetermined outcome. And I\u2019m just supposed to shut up &amp; take it with a f***ing smile on my face. It\u2019s like when I first talked to my pcp, what she heard me say was \u201cI snore &amp; would love it if I could get one of those medieval torture device contraptions!\u201d\nI did reach out to my pcp &amp; we had the conversation I had been expecting. But I had to be the one to ask for it. She said I do have moderate sleep apnea &amp; need this. I could go to another more upscale clinic for another sleep study. If I lose weight it should help some. I am losing weight. So far I\u2019ve lost over 30 lbs. since February. And maybe if I have a lower BMI I could get a device implanted, similar to a pacemaker, to electronically shock my system into breathing correctly. That doesn\u2019t sound appealing either. She is prescribing me a sedative to help me sleep. Honestly I would rather risk a possible heart attack than accept this fraudulent torture device. \nMy own father had a cpap machine, still died at 58 from a heart attack. My boyfriend\u2019s stepdad had a cpap machine. He died around the same age from low oxygen levels in his sleep, wearing the stupid mask. But this demented torture device is suppose to prevent that?!?\nI believe in science &amp; vaccinations. But something about these things &amp; this process doesn\u2019t feel right. I definitely DID NOT GIVE INFORMED CONSENT. How could I? \nI know several people that have them &amp; absolutely swear by them. They really consider them life savers. I honestly don\u2019t care that they love them. I DON\u2019T WANT ONE!!! Their opinions mean absolutely nothing to me. They all say the same exact thing, like they are reading from a script. Very cultish vibes! \nI have very unhappily &amp; begrudgingly agreed to try it. But the rage &amp; hate I feel is overwhelming. I want to scream &amp; cry &amp; break sh!t because of this. I have lots other thoughts &amp; feelings &amp; if I publicize them, they will at the very least get me kicked off of social media. At worst, they might get me a visit from the police or a psych hold. I feel like I have no agency or choice over my own body, &amp; nobody cares. I should just shut up, stop my stupid thoughts &amp; feelings, &amp; do as I\u2019m told. I\u2019m not a real person. I\u2019m not worthy of my own thoughts &amp; feelings. Just get over it because nobody cares about me.",

So I wasn't opposed to the study when my doctor suggested it.\n\nThere seemed to be a predetermined outcome. I got set up with the cpap. It was a pain to get used to wearing it, but I will say that my sleep is 100% better. I often didn't feel rested and no one wanted to room with me because of the snoring. Neither of those are problems now. I hope something works out for you.",

I think the deviated septum was more on point. For my eldest son, his tonsils and adenoids were the culprit. The pushing of everyone has apena is ridiculous. You're not alone. See an ENT since you're questioning.",

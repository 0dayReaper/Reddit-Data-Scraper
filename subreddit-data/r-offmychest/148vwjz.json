    "postText": "For context, I (18F) bought a new pair of white shoes with money I earnt from my holiday job from Nike and they are quite expensive. This is my first purchase ever and first good pair of shoes. \n\nWhile boarding the company bus today the asshole in front of me with 0 self awareness stepped back and stepped directly onto my left shoe (THE ENTIRE DAMN SHOE). The piece of shit turned around and stared right at me, fully aware he had painfully stepped on someone\u2019s shoe and didn\u2019t even bother to apologise. And he continued up the bus anyway, no shits given whatsoever. \n\nTo my horror when I looked down at my shoe there was a HUGE, ugly blob shaped soil stain on my white shoe, and the front was super badly creased as well. My heart literally dropped, considering I paid for my shoes out of my own wallet. \n\nWhen alighting the bus I was right behind the fucker that stepped on my shoe but I didn\u2019t confront him. Now I\u2019m replaying in my head the scenario that I go up to him and confront him; ask him if he has any manners at all and make him apologise for what he did. \n\nI really really regret not confronting him and making him apologise. It has been hours. I stare down at my shoes and heart literally hurts. These are my first nice shoes in forever and I worked so many hours to pay for them. I\u2019m super heartbroken over this.\n\nThank you for reading :(",

    "postText": "I can't anymore. My dad is not a bad person but some of his behaviour are so stressful for me and also for my mom. If someone tell something he doesn't like he gets so angry and starts to yell it's mostly for the relatives, whom are really good person but something they said like \"no you didn't get it right he wasn't wrong\" but if my disagree he will get angry and will cut all the ties but never tell us to cut ties. If my mom try to tell him that he was wrong or like it's a very very small matter he should let go then he will also scream at my mom. He doesn't take care of his health so if he feel ill we try to get him a doctor but he refuses. He is super stubborn and yells in small things. I don't know the incident nobody ever tells me anything about it but I know after that incident he cut all the ties with his parents, brothers, sisters. I only know the incident was with my grandfather but he cutted ties with EVERYONE from the family they tried all time but yes he never tried to talk to them. When my grandfather died he refused to acknowledge. I understand by the conversation that the incident wasn't something big to cut ties but he did. I think My grandfather tried to stop him for doing something. He asked so much about my dad in his last bed but yup he didn't visited. My grandmother is old but always ask for him he doesn't care and the list go on. I can't anymore it's kind of impossible to explain the whole thing typing but it's stressful very stressful for all of us. I can't really explain clearly also I am bad at explaining and writing.",

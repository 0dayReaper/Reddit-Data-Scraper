I\u2019m 17 but I have no real friends, since I was 11 I\u2019ve struggled speaking to people and i don\u2019t even know why, I want to speak to people I just don\u2019t when people speak to me, I don\u2019t why I just feel like I can\u2019t.\n\n Everyone I know apart from my family probably think I\u2019m either a weirdo or just kinda rude because I ignore them when they speak to me.\n\nSince I\u2019ve left college for study leave and just been at home, I\u2019m feeling really lonely, because all I can do is study and play video games on my own because I have no friends to play with, and it\u2019s really making me feel kinda depressed and I hate myself for being like I was for the last 6/7 years. \n\nI also recently deleted my social media accounts and made new ones, and nobody I had on the old ones added my new ones which makes me feel even worse, so I don\u2019t even have anyone to speak to on my phone, which just makes me feel even more lonely. \n\nI\u2019ve lost all motivation to go to the gym and I\u2019ve put on about 30lbs in like 2 months which makes me hate myself even more.",

Even if i dont have much. I just embrace my situation and do the most that i can with it. Nothing can make you happy, you can only choose to be happy about whatever satisfies you.",

I want different friends who can understand me but every time I say that someone I make friends with says something personal and I just want to leave. I cant even talk to people properly and like you people probably think I\u2019m really rude because my automatic response to people I don\u2019t is being rude and distant even though I don\u2019t want to be. I\u2019m really sorry. Maybe you should try and go to therapy or some sort of group where people who struggle with making friends could join or something (which idk much about but that\u2019s probably a thing)",

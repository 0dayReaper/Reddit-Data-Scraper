    "postText": "live in a house with no love in it, not for me anyway. I feel use me, lied to and push me aside because I don't matter to them. I'm sitting in the next room suffering and I have absolutely no one. I don't have any friends because you need to be able to go places and I can't I'm alone most days because I have health problems and not very mobile. I don't even have anyone to help me in that area as well. They make me feel like I'm a burden to them when these used to be the only two people i could trust because people just end up using me. I don't know what to do. I feel death knocking on my door and I want to go. the amount of stress, anxiety and sadness I'm under I could have a heart attack any day now. I'm heartbroken. I want and need love so much right now but they have none to give. I tell them I really need help. I'm practically begging them, almost pleading them to please help me but I get ignored. One is my ex, our relationship didn't work out but we ended up being friends. I thought he loved me enough to care for me. I promised to be here and he promised to help me out. now I don't know. The other one used to be my best friend and I would do anything for him. I told him a few years ago that if he has no where to go that he could always come here and my door is always open to him.. One is the very few people I genuinely care about. I care about so much that I told him that, if he doesn't find love and is not happy to give me a chance to try to make him happy. How many people would ever say that to you? Not very many. Now I look at him and think about all the time he hurt me. When times were good i thought, finally, I have found my people. I have finally found a family. Now my trust is erroding. Now I don't think life is even worth it anymore.",

            "comment": "I am basically the same as you. The people I've tried to share my issues with seen to either think it's not possible for me to feel depressed. Or even think I mention it to them for attention. Lol. I've been hiding my depression for so long to not burn people with it. But no one seems to take me seriously. Even at the slightest mention of me being in a down, dark state is met with mockery or total dismissing or avoidance. \n\nIt's cool though. Everyone I've put faith in to lean on even a little has shown me with words or actions that what I feel or think don't mean shit, and that my pain or suffering isn't worthy of recognition much less worry of a talk, or shoulder to lean on.\n\nBut it's cool. I'll maintain and keep on\n\nThere is no choice but to keep on.\n\nJust keep on also anon.",

On a side note, you might be so capable, that others can\u2019t fit you into a \u2018needs help\u2019 box.

I've got a little savings. I've helped out my kid with quite a bit of money this week, helped their mom with a little money, paid some fines. Still got money to make it through the week and won't even be touching my savings. And honestly next week that's going to double there's no doubt about it. Capable isn't the point. That's not what  depression is about. Yeah I mean it wears down on your actual ability and drive to do things but I mean I fought through that get those feelings of hopelessness stay. Capability has nothing to do with depression.",

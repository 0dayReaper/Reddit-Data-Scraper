    "postText": "I have this awful habit of getting attached at the hip to one person and one person only. That person could be a lover or just a friend, it doesn't matter. When this happens, it always starts out so well. We become the best of friends, become so close that we practically know everything about each other, and I feel like I've found a home.\n\nIt's all very swell until that innocent attachment morphs into something monstrous.\n\nThe moment their attention isn't on me, I feel jealous. I feel abandoned, I feel angry, and I ask myself what I did wrong to deserve this. Then, I will somehow manage to convince myself that no one loves me and I should die before I spend the next few minutes whispering, \"Kill yourself\" to myself over and over again.\n\nAll because the attention was off of me for a good chunk of the day. \n\nEven worse, if I ever have a fight with a person I've attached to, I fall into depression and I feel useless. I lie in my bed, and I can't do anything because their absence makes me numb.  I know this isn't normal. I know this is toxic and I'm crazy, but I can't fucking stop. Love and positive attention are like drugs to me, I'm desperate for it. I need it, or I can't function at all.\n\n\nIf you're reading this and considering recommending therapy, I'm already there. Even so, I don't feel like I'm any closer to being fixed.",

I've genuinely thought about if I have it or not, but it's a bit tricky because every time I try to bring up the possibility with a family member or close friend, I get told that there's \"no way I have that\". It's also hard to get an honest opinion when the stereotype is a person who's screams or is outright mean to the people they love.\n\nI don't lash out at people, not even when I have meltdowns over feeling \"unloved.\" Even when I'm feeling resentful towards the other person, I don't try to hurt other people. I think the worst thing I do is try to guilt trip people if they've made me sad or hurt my feelings, even if they were just doing something within their right to do, like drawing boundaries.\n\nThe only thing that makes me unsure of if this is BPD is the concept of splitting. Although my opinion of my family is very subject to change at a moment's notice (I love them, but it's VERY easy for me to go into reasons why I'm not entirely satisfied with my upbringing), I'm generally very loyal to my close friends and my opinion of them never suddenly 180s into being completely negative.\n\nWhat I am diagnosed with is Autism, as well as Major Depressive Disorder and severe anxiety. I don't know if my therapist is trained for BPD/CPTSD, but probably not.",

Second- no one on the internet can or should diagnose you with anything, but some of what you're describing sounds like borderline personality disorder traits. People with BPD often struggle with intense and unstable relationships, fear of real or perceived abandonment (and frantic attempts to avoid abandonment), rapidly shifting, intense emotions, intense anger, unstable sense of self, and impulsive/reckless behaviors and self-harm. \n\nIf some of this sounds familiar to you, consider discussing it with your therapist-- the good news is that BPD is treatable and often responds very well to a specific type of therapy called Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) that helps you learn how to tolerate and regulate distressing emotions and helps you learn to communicate in a healthy and effective way in relationships. \n\nOn a broader note- if you've been in therapy for a long time and feel like it isn't helping or aren't seeing any positive changes in your life, consider discussing it with your therapist to see if you can change the approach, or consider shopping around for a therapist that might be a better fit for you.",

I'm definitely planning on bringing it up next session, though, especially since a lot of people here have been saying this sounds like that could be the case.\n\nI don't want to jump the gun on changing therapists just yet, but if nothing comes out of expressing my concerns, I'll definitely do so.\n\nThank you. \ud83d\udc9b",

            "comment": "hi there,   \n\n\nyou nine thousand percent sound like you have BPD : borderline personality disorder. It almost exclusively stems from trauma and is characterised by a lack of emotional regulation stemming from a deep insecurity about being left or abandoned, leading to outward inappropriate and even emotionally abusive behaviours exactly like you describe.  \n\n\nYour first part of the description sounds like the \"favourite person\" phenonemon BPD people tend to do, you should look it up. What happens is they centrate on a single favourite person who they build up in their mind to be the whole world to them, and at some point that imaginary world comes crashing down when reality hits and that person turns out to be a real human. They then \"split\" on the favourite person and turn to absolutel seething with anger at them over the \"betrayal\" and internally are deeply depressed because they feel \"abandoned\" again - exactly their central fear that drives the condition. The way you describe that initial attachment turning \"monstrous\" sounds like this.  \n\n\nThe good news is that BPD is one of the few conditions you can actually \"grow out of\" with time and therapy and work. But you need to acknowledge it, and change doesn't happen unless you do something you typically don't want to do to make that change happen.",

You need to realize that having a relationship is something you add to your life. It isn't your life. \nBeing alone long enough to actually just sit there in your own company and be okay with yourself is crucial. Your most important relationship is with yourself. No one else can make you feel complete.",

            "comment": "I was just writing to a friend, about how I was so scared of losing a friend of mine to someone else. How it lead to me having lots of very terrifying thoughts and panic attacks, and to me constantly making nasty comments about why she's a bad person and I'm more important to him. Many can tell that I adore him and I'm clearly attached to him to the hip. One time, I was very visibly stressed and depressed at the thought of him picking my ex-friend over me. If she could manipulate people I once called my friends to side with her, she could do the same to him. I haven't talked to him for two days and he hasn't said anything to me either, and all I could think is that he's probably talking to her and he'll decide to turn against me. Fyi, I only see him as a friend. He's not the first person who's caused me to act like that. It goes way back to at least a decade ago. I've been told that it's normal to act all like that, but I could move on from that phase. I've also been told that I'm an obsessive, selfish creep who needs to get some help. Reading this makes me feel... relieved that I'm not the only one who's experienced quite a few similar habits/traits. It's so unhealthy to react negatively to someone who needs their own space and to be their own person. I can't afford therapy, so all I can do is try to remind myself that any person in my life doesn't determine my own worth. They probably don't exist for only me. So I don't exist for only them. You could live with this message, and since you're currently in therapy, it'll help you better.",

With accurate diagnosis and medication/treatment toward that diagnosis, things can REALLY turn around. She\u2019s on the right meds and in the right therapy now and she\u2019s doing really well. There is hope.",

I have 4 younger siblings I helped take care of, so while I don't know everything about it, I have a good idea of what I'll be getting into but babies are so cute and amazing and I love them and want one (or more) and once I am financially stable I am immediately adopting or having one with my partner depending how close we are at the time and if they feel up for it. But that is something I'm gonna be making clear once I'm an adult. I want kids, and if you don't, then a relationship won't work out so see ya, you're nice, but not the one. Toddlers are adorable too. And I'd adopt teens too if my SO let's me because teens need help too. Though if I adopt teens I want to be sure the rest of my kids are out of the house first based on the stuff I read. Maybe I'd adopt large siblings groups too because they need it too! I just love the idea of being a parent, I love little kids, they're cute all the way up to like, 10. And I love the idea of helping people too young to help themselves and watching them grow and knowing I helped.",

Do you know how many ppl are there who get baby fever and have kids and then hate their lives bc they didn't expect all the difficulties? Lots. It's also different when the kids are not yours, it's much easier to like a kid, play with them and take care of them when you know that you will give them back at the end. Only have children after you thought about it long and hard, learned about all the difficulties that will arise and you are sure that you are capable to provide for them, anything short of that is just irresponsible.

This includes all of the housework/chores (you know in case your wife gets bed bound from a rough pregnancy), knowing which doctors to call for what and for what issues (pre-natal and pediatric), etc. Also picking out clothes for the kid according to the appropriate weather (not just throw whatever on), scheduling appointments with teachers/other parent-teacher stuff, managing everyone\u2019s schedule while getting enough sleep and making sure everyone is getting fed nutritiously and getting all their needs met. This includes your partner. \n\nNot to mention taking care of your kid when they are SCREAMING because their gums hurts so bad and it\u2019s 3am and you haven\u2019t slept more than 4 hours consecutively each night. Or they have a fever or tummy ache and can\u2019t settle down. Or when your favorite/most cherished item gets destroyed because baby is curious about the world around them. Or when they hit their terrible twos and are total assholes and pushing all of your buttons all at once. \n\nAlso, goes without saying\u2026find out what it is REALLY like and how far your limits are if you have a medically special needs kid. This ranges anywhere from autism, to light/intense learning disability, to some physical disability, to full on physical and mental disability (like my niece who is 7 now but is wheelchair bound and is mentally/emotionally at 6 month, nonverbal, cannot eat solid food and has medical needs out the WAZOO). Figuring out how to call insurance companies, to battle for what your kid needs and to get them in a timely manner, to sleepless nights at the hospital for yet another procedure where you don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll help or not. \n\nAnd what about what you would do should your spouse dies or leaves you, leaving you to be a single parent? Or your child doesn\u2019t end up liking what you like and doesn\u2019t follow you around like you want cause they like your partner more? And you mentioned you wanted to go to medical school \u2014 have you talked to physicians in the specialty you\u2019re going into about what it\u2019s like to be an MD and to raise a child at the same time? \n\nAgain I love this for you because more guys need to be open about their emotions and what they\u2019re feeling. But this fluffy feeling doesn\u2019t negate any or all of the hardships that are often VERY underestimated in parenthood.",

The feeling is amazing, but the realisation of reality can bum that feeling out. Which is also normal! Because of the strong feeling, you want your child to grow up in a loving and safe environment meaning you worry about procuring a lot of aspects I.e. A home, stable job to provide, a loving partner which you have a stable relationship with, your own physical and mental health, just to name a few.\n\nKeep the feeling in your heart and don't lose it. It's a wonderful thing. Hopefully you'll experience it soon, when everything is ready. Good luck and much happiness OP!",

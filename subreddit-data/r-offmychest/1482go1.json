    "postText": "Please never falsely accuse people of S/A. It\u2019s a horrible thing and not only it\u2019s a false accusation, it ruins lives. I\u2019ve lost my entire friend group because of a girl (14F) who falsely accused me (15F) in school after I called her crazy. Let me continue\n\nI used to be best friends with this girl, let\u2019s call her Camille. I had a crush on her and we hugged all the time, (consensually) she never knew I crushed on her tho I assume she cut ties with me WHEN she found out, because she ghosted me for no reason, as a result leaving me by myself at homecoming while my mom had to come pick me up. A month later, I accidentally tell one of her friends that she is crazy for doing that to me, her friend tells her and Camille asks in a DM why I called her that. I patiently tell her why and block her, that was it for now.\n\nFast forward a couple of months and I\u2019m suddenly cut from my group chat of 9-10 members with no explanation, and only found out months later that Camille had accused me of SA. Although counselors had a talk with her and found this accusation to be false, the school knows and it\u2019s ruined my friendship and social life. One person who used to be my friend in the group had plans to call me homophobic slurs the next time he saw me and was told by his friend to film it. I have no friends at school anymore and am talked bad about behind my back daily in one way or another by this group. S/A is not a thing to be taken lightly. I really wish people understood.",

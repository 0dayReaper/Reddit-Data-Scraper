These are just a few that pop in my head every now and then and go \u201cwtf\u201d \n\n- You don\u2019t drink Corona right? Damn Mexicans need to keep their shit on their side of the border(was Mexican but believed he was white because he had money)\n\n- Why don\u2019t you just buy a new house?(after saying my heater broke)\n\n- Does it hurt when they replace your nails?(he thought my nails had been literally pulled off and replaced with acrylics) \n\n- My wife is agoraphobic, she\u2019d never find out\n\n- Can I dress you up as this anime character?(literal child) \n\n- Mentioned something about breaking his dick back in high school(wasn\u2019t paying attention till that)\n\n- Can\u2019t you just push out the cyst like a baby?\n\n- Women can\u2019t have high sex drives, that\u2019s a testosterone thing\n\n- Thought I wanted drugs because I like mushrooms on my pizza\n\n- There\u2019s no such thing as pescatarians\n\n- Michael Jackson died years before they announced it and they had a robot to do concerts till it got too smart and self aware\n\n- Aliens hide in clouds and the parts of dna that scientists can\u2019t figure out are passed down from alien ancestors(dude probably lost his mind with the movie nope)\n\n- Narwhals aren\u2019t real\n\n- Flamingos aren\u2019t real\n\n- If I had to fight an animal I\u2019d fight a hippo because nothing that fat and lazy can be dangerous \n\n- Everyone with allergies should just stop having allergies and breathe better\n \n- Humans apparently taste like pork \n\n- If they buried people standing up then there would be more room for everyone \n\n- Sunglasses are for the weak \n\n- Why don\u2019t you just have a baby while you\u2019re still ripe? \n\n- So you\u2019re extra cushioned down there?(mentioned I have endometriosis)\n\n- The vagina is just an inside out penis \n\n- Humming birds are like unicorns(honestly wish I had more context but that was all I got)\n\n- My ass is too sensitive for me to be gay\n\n- It\u2019s cheating if I kiss you, so you\u2019ll have to kiss me/we can have sex as long as I don\u2019t kiss you \n\n- You\u2019re basically a VIP prostitute(was supposed to be a compliment)\n\n- Everyone should work for what they want(spending mommy and daddy\u2019s money)\n\n- I don\u2019t understand why this person can\u2019t work full time(was a teen in hs)",

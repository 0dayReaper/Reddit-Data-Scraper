    "postText": "I have always have this fascination for men with wet hair. I don\u2019t really know why. I just do. Recently it\u2019s been difficult to get my priorities straight in my life because of this. I decided that today I\u2019m going to take a break from social media. Just for the time being. I just wanted to sign off here. Hopefully this struggle will go away. I am at my wits end. I hope and pray I will be more mentally and physically healthy through this. This is just too much a distraction and I don\u2019t want it controlling me anymore.",

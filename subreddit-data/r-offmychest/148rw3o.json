    "postText": "Let me start off by saying what my mother did was completely wrong, she read my brothers gfs diary which read that she had caught him texting girls for the 4th time since they\u2019ve been together (3yrs), my mom is not a girls girl and my brother and the gf live with my parents.\nI\u2019m so disgusted with my brother but not shocked, their not married yet and don\u2019t have children or anything, I like my sister in law but she is so naive and soft and I know he\u2019s going to continue doing this to her, she\u2019s not able to stand up for herself and her own mother has passed away so I don\u2019t think she has many other supporting females around her, I want her to leave my brother as she\u2019s such a nice young girl and she does not deserve my brother, should I try and speak to her and what would I even say because she can\u2019t know her journal was read or should I keep my nose out of it, I want to protect her as she so vulnerable",

            "comment": "Someone said to not get involved but I kinda disagree. If I were in the girlfriends shoes Id want to be informed especially since you explained she\u2019s lacking lots of support. She\u2019s likely staying despite what your brother is doing because she feels she has no one else. If you won\u2019t directly get involved atleast be there for her as a friend and semi discreetly let her know if she needs to talk about something your there for her. If you do want to let her know (which I\u2019d personally do) you can sit her down and say essentially what you explained in the post. I also imagine it\u2019d just be sad that if she stays with your brother for years to come you\u2019ll also have to endure the guilt of knowing/witnessing the relationship. Not to mention the long term pain the gf will have to endure while the one who is doing the hurting is essentially getting away with it. I guess you can also try confront your brother but I don\u2019t imagine that would do much. All in all op I wish you the best of luck and whatever you decide to do you aren\u2019t a bad person and don\u2019t feel too bad!",

It\u2019s not your responsibility or job to handle any of this stuff. My advise is to stay far away from his woman and definitely far away from putting yourself into the middle of this situation. Trust me on that.",

    "postText": "When she broke up with me she said this. It completely shattered my heart and left me in shock. We never really talked about our futures throughout our relationship because we were living in the moment. I felt I was living in the moment at least, and she mentioned she was too. I don\u2019t know. We talked about goals for careers but we were at different stages in life (fresh grad, I\u2019m still in school), and I was more uncertain about mine more than hers. We had adventures vaguely planned, things what we wanted to do with each other, but we looked away from conversations about building our relationship through actions like moving in together, marriage, kids, etc\u2026. Looking back I realize that was something I needed to do and figure out for myself\u2026 \n\nI think we were both nervous and scared because we were each other\u2019s first real love. I was so open to being with her for longer than nearly 2 years, but slowly and slowly it seems she didn\u2019t feel the same. I don\u2019t know why. I was okay with the uncertainty our future held, because I desperately wanted to work on figuring all of that shit together\u2026 She was everything to me.\n\nI want to understand why she said this, really digest it, but I know it will ruin me if she told me the truth. It\u2019s so weird because we never really talked it out to begin with. I guess I just don\u2019t need to know. If anything, it is a lesson for my future loves. It breaks me that it isn\u2019t with her\u2026 at least for now.\n\nSo really, I don\u2019t want to know why she said that, and that is what I\u2019m going to keep telling myself. But that one fucking phrase keeps playing in the back of my mind and I can\u2019t get rid of it. It\u2019s been a few weeks now. I miss her so much. \n\nIf you ever see this, I love you for what we shared. I hope you\u2019re doing well.",

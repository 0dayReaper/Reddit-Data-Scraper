    "postText": "We\u2019re getting married very soon (couple of weeks). It\u2019s something we\u2019ve both wanted for a long time but now we\u2019re finally in a situation where it feels right. We have our own home now and we\u2019re so close to getting married. He said he wanted to wait until after the wedding and we\u2019d have a bit of a joke between ourselves of \u201clet\u2019s just do it now\u201d and we\u2019d be goofy about it. Well a couple days ago he surprised me by not pulling out. \n\nYes I know it\u2019s not an effective method but we weren\u2019t overly trying to prevent a pregnancy. We were happy if it happened before we got married. \n\nI was ovulating/in my fertile window. I\u2019m now in the \u201c2 week wait\u201d and it\u2019s the longest 2 weeks ever. \n\nI\u2019m just so excited that we\u2019ve started trying and I desperately want to tell someone and share the excitement. We haven\u2019t told our families yet. Even if in 2wks it goes positive, I\u2019d be too scared to tell our families until after 12wks. \n\nHusband isn\u2019t optimistic that we\u2019ve been successful on our first go but I feel very optimistic about it. I know it might not happen but I\u2019m still hopeful. \n\nAnyway I just wanted to get this off my chest cause I just wanna tell people\u2026!!!",

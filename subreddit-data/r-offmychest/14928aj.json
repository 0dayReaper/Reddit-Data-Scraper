    "postText": "I don\u2019t know if I want to be in the relationship I\u2019m in anymore. \n\nBackstory:\nKnown this person since high school we were together and went our separate ways and then found ourselves back to each other years later.\n\n\n90% of the time things are great, no arguing/lots of communication/typical relationship things. \nBut the 10% is what makes me worried. He can be very condescending when upset/disrespectful when angry/has no want to talk through issues/dismissive.\nI understand we all go through rough times and sometimes people need to deal with their own issues before they can be present and healthy in a relationship. \nEven with understanding that though I don\u2019t agree with mistreating people and projecting your feelings onto them to the point where instead of facing your feelings internally, you start blaming your partner for the way you feel. \n\nI try to have sit downs and create an environment for open communication but every time it turns into either an argument due to him saying I\u2019m not listening to his concerns because I have questions (I do ask a lot of questions but I\u2019ve explained to him, that\u2019s how I best understand where he is coming from and what I need to do to show up as a better partner. He says it overwhelms him when I ask questions) or him avoiding having the conversation to begin with and telling me \u201cI really don\u2019t want to talk right now.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve asked him if he is ready to stay committed to our relationship or if he\u2019d prefer to be single and he always says he doesn\u2019t want to lose me. I just feel like I\u2019m the only one putting effort into trying to make a happy home for us and it\u2019s getting to a point where it\u2019s affecting my happiness as an individual. \n\nLately I\u2019ve been focusing on regulating my mood and keeping it neutral even when I can tell he\u2019s being touchy; \n\nfor example: there was clothes to put away on the bed, mines and his. He asked if I could put mines away before bed which I did and I had some hangers left so I put them on his side of the bed with his clothes just in case he wanted to use them. The response I got from doing that when he walked in the room was \u201cwhy would you just dump these hangers here instead of putting them away\u201d and I said with a smile to keep things light hearted \u201coh Im sorry I wasn\u2019t sure if you would need them to put away your clothes I can put them back in the closet\u201d and with obvious attitude he threw them to the side of the bed and mumbled something under his breath\u201d\nFor me I don\u2019t understand why there had to be any time of negativity in that reaction but small things like that have been happening more frequently then I\u2019m used to with him. \n\nI think that\u2019s when it starting hitting me that maybe I\u2019m giving so much of myself and compressing my emotions to keep things \u201cfine for the moment\u201d, which is obviously not conducive for a healthy relationship. \n\nI just don\u2019t feel supported emotionally in this relationship and I don\u2019t know where to go from here..\nSorry for the ridiculously long post \ud83d\ude05\n\nThis honestly could just be a really rough patch we are going through but",

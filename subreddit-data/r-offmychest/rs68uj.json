    "postText": "She had me when she was FOURTEEN. And I (24M) was given up for adoption. My parents told me about her growing up. I still have the letter she wrote me that she asked if they could give it to me if they wanted. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy reading it sometimes and knowing it was a literal child who wrote it saying she\u2019s sorry she couldn\u2019t be my mommy but she hopes I\u2019m happy. She was open to having contact but we moved for my dad\u2019s job when I was 11 and then it seemed impossible to find her. \n\nBut luckily I did. \n\nShe\u2019s working at this small restaurant and I keep going but she doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s me. We talk sometimes. And she seems like a nice lady. Sometime when she says something like \u201cdo you want a refill, honey\u201d or uses another term like that I wanna tell her. Idk why it makes me nervous. We talk sometimes and she seems really genuine. If it\u2019s not super busy she\u2019s more open to talking about random stuff. I literally drive 2 hours to come eat at this place just to see her. And it\u2019s like she knows me already because I\u2019m there once or 2 times a week for the past 3 months so she always says hi with a big smile. \n\nBut man if only she knew",

Giving up a baby while she leaves you a letter to meet? Hun.. she loves you, 14 or 80 a mothers love doesn't change. Otherwise she would have erased any way to contact her. It won't suprise me you're the biggest hole left in her heart. Because a mother is never whole when she lost a child who she loves. \n\nIf you're to scared, write a letter about yourself with a phone number or a mail. Or leave a babyphoto she would recognize with your name and phonenumber in an envelope with her name on it. Then you don't have to say \"i'm your son\". But take the step, because regret is more painful than the present. And every moment counts, the present is only thing you can change. You deserve her and she definitely deserves you.\n\nEdit: would you please keep us updated? Otherwise there is a small hole in my heart :(",

We have had a wonderful relationship for the last 15 years.  She was at that park.  Found out she grew up 5 miles from me.\nShe could be craving reconnection as much as I did.\nI wish you a fulfilled journey and much love.",

My father has never agreed to talk about him outside of that one time, there\u2019s a lot of shame/denial. Well I finally found my brother last year. He lives two hours away and seems cool, and I casually stalk his wife and daughters on social media, wanting to meet all of them but not knowing how he\u2019d feel about my reaching out - maybe there\u2019s a reason he hasn\u2019t been looking for us, like (reasonably) being pissed at my/our father.

Sure. But it's not a certainty. Do you have any reason to think so? I personally think he either doesn't know about you (you only heard of him once after all) doesn't know how to contact you, can't gather the courage to talk to you. \n \nAnd even if he is pissed at your father you are not your father so maybe he's an ass and will not want to contact you. But maybe he posses a brain and will want to meet you. Remember, it's a bombshell in his life so even if he doesn't know how to act for some time it's ok. Just let him breathe and once he process the emotions it's going to be cool",

It's possible that OP might want to hang onto it.\n\nGood luck OP! Also, there are subreddits and a ton of private FB groups, with people in your exact situation.\n\nEdit to add: OP, I have two older half-siblings both were adopted years ago at birth. We've reunited with my oldest sister (from my mom) and wish every day that our oldest brother (from my dad) someday will reach out to us. Adoption reunions can go all kinds of crazy ways. Given that she was a child, it's possible that your birth may have some trauma associated for her. Not all reunions are loving and like a Hallmark movie. It sounds like you have great support from your (adopted) parents. Can I also recommend that maybe you find a therapist that specializes in adoptions/adoptees? They can help you navigate ALL of the emotions and fears that might be bubbling around within yourself. They can also support you if you decide to introduce yourself and it doesn't go well. \n\nVirtual internet stranger hugs from me if you'd like them!",

You should go when the Restaurant is near close and tell her towards the end of her shift if possible. Just a suggestion that I think is carefully thought out to keep her safe. I imagine there will be a lot of crying once you tell her. Uh a part of me wishes you would tell her just bc I would love to hear a Cinderella ending. But another part of me is Reluctant bc I don\u2019t want you to get hurt if something bad comes out of it.\n\nYou can always write a letter and instruct her boss to give it to her at the end of her shift. Include your phone number in it in case she decides to contact you. And just wait. Chances are she will contact you and you can talk on the phone. That\u2019s what I would do. It would be the safest thing for both parties and can help eliminate the tension. Tell her how you feel and how much the letter she wrote to you means. Good luck OP, please write an update to your story. I would love to read the outcome.",

            "comment": "\r  \nPlease tell her and try not to wait to long...\r  \n\r  \nHear is my story: I'm the byproduct of an affair. Mom was single, bio-dad was not. After I was born, he went back to his wife and other kids, I had no contact with him. When I was 3 mom was married and he adopted me, he is dad. When I was 14ish, I found out that I had a bio-dad out their. I chose not to contact him, as he put his life back together, had another child with his wife. I never wanted to interfere and open old wounds. \r  \n\r  \nFast forward to just over 3 years ago, in my mid-40s, I did a 23andMe for the health results, I wanted to see if their was anything I needed to be concerned about from that side as I did not know much about them outside of the names and a bit of Facebook checking out. I had cousin from that side contact me when the DNA matched up. We started talking, found out the family that know about me had been longing to meet me, including the bio-dad. So I meet them, it went great and I have gotten close with them. I love the family and they are great people. \r  \n\r  \n5 months after meeting them, bio-dad had a major heart attack and almost did not make it. For the next year he was in the hospital more than out. We lost him in February of last year. He has now been gone longer than I knew him. \r  \n\r  \nTheir were a lot of questions that I and my mom had for him, some of which could have been very hard. Right away I did not want to ask as it was new. Then after the heart attack, he was in rough shape, I  did not want to stress him out by asking, so never had the chance to get some of those answers. And a lot of that time we did get to see him, he was in the hospital. Never had the chance to really get to know the real him. \r  \n\r  \nBut even with his loss, I now have the rest of the family that is in my life, 3 new brothers, niece and nephews, cousins who are some great people that I really enjoy spending time with and getting to know. I did sadly miss out on meeting my grandparents. Everything that the family has said, my grandma was a wonderful person and really wanted to met me, even had pictures and articles from the paper from me growing up. Of the whole experience, this is the one thing I regret, I wish we would have connected a few years earlier.  \r  \n\r  \nAfter my all my ramblings, my point, don't wait to long to tell her. You don't have to do it today, but you don't want to loose that chance. You could have another terrific family out their that in addition to her to have in your life. You have a connection and it sounds like you two get along, and hopefully that means it will continue once she knows. And on the off chance things don't work out, she is a few hours away, your not going to run into her at the grocery store on a weekly basis. \r  \n\r  \nBest of luck and hope to see an update!",

He has the same beautiful hair she always pictured. \n\nYour mom might have done the same. She might have spent the last 24 years looking at boys with your phenotype wondering. Maybe wondering about that sweet boy who sits at her table and has the same laugh as her. \n\nI hope you find the best time to reach out to her bc she\u2019s probably been waiting her whole adult life for this moment.",

I think of him every day and as I write this I'm trying not to cry at work. Giving up a child is easily the most difficult decision to make and is usually done out of pure love for the child. I gave up my son because I wanted him to have a wonderful life full of opportunities that I never had and was in no position to provide at 18. \n\nI just had my second baby and it's been an emotional rollercoaster. I think about what kind of brother my first would be and how they look different (different fathers) and how they look alike. The adoption is closed. I know his first and middle name, the first names of his parents, and what state the adoptive parents lived in when he was adopted, but that's all I know. I hope he wants to know me in the future, but I know he may never seek me out. I do have trauma associated with my adoption but I would still want to know. \n\nI agree with the note idea. I would add maybe put it in a sealed envelope and write something like \"Non-urgent. Please read when seated and in private\" or something better worded. If she was open to contact in the past, I'd say it's still likely that she is. Please let her know. That relationship could be the best part of your future.",

While I know when I met him the timing was right, I would give a lot to have more time with him. Ask more questions. Like stupid stuff, what was his first kiss. A weird one is I wondered if we had the same bellybutton\u2026. Bc we definitely didn\u2019t have the same feet. \n\nNow here\u2019s the hard part, knowing your mom will also mean knowing how she got pregnant at 14. And that could be tough for so many different reasons. \n\nMy only real advice is remember she is human, she makes mistakes, and she has hard experiences. She just like you had a whole life time of learning and growing. Lots of our lives learning how to deal with the same patterns in different scenarios. \n\nI didn\u2019t deny my hurt when I talked to him but I remembered he has his self talk he needed to live through too. The more I was open to listening from an objective stand point the more I learned about him and his life. The more I learned about my history. I should have done it more. Should have had sleep overs watching movies and arguing about plots. Should have done a lot more. \n\nI wish you luck and love.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you need some processing help.

She wrote a note to my wife when she was born explaining that she loved her, but couldn't provide a good life for her. It was such a sweet note that helped avoid the \"why didn't she want me?\" thoughts. \n\nBy the time we met, when she was 23, my wife has used hints in the note and on her birth certificate to track down her birth mother's family tree and a few close family member obituaries. Long story short, my wife tracked down her birth mother's Facebook.\n\nAfter much debating, my wife messaged her. The message began with \"23 years ago, a brave young woman made the difficult choice to place her newborn girl up for adoption.\" It was very scary, but the note gave her some confidence that her birth mother would want to talk.\n\nThey now frequently text and call each other about once a week. My wife's birth mother even helped her find her biological father. They are both wonderful people who are so happy that she found them. \n\nI know that this is just some random person's story on the internet, but I hope it gives you some courage. The fact that your birth mother wrote you a letter shows that she wanted to reach out to you. I guarantee that she has been afraid that you would hate her. \n\nWhatever you choose, I wish you luck. I'm glad that you have found her and that you can get some idea of what kind of a person she is.",

Though, I took the responsibility, I can imagine how hard it was for your mom and in the back of her mind, still is. She deserves to know its you, it will heal so much of her pain. I pray this ends up happening and you get to build a beautiful life. I have built a great relationship with my bio family as an adult and I couldn't be more content with my life now.",

Did I mentioned I was scared?\n\nI grew to hate my \u201cfather\u201d for leaving- for what he did. I never did well in school and I never learned a family trade.\n\nI ended up ok. I ended up having many father figures that came and want, but I do believe a constant one would\u2019ve meant more.\n\nI\u2019m happy for you. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re able to take your drive and listen to some cool music. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to sit down anonymously and eat alone, knowing you truly aren\u2019t- and either is she.\n\nI\u2019ll have to try your style.

Do it \u2764\ufe0f\n\nETA also, my parents were thrilled I found them because they wondered who *I* was, and if I was safe, a good person, taken care of etc. They also said there was so much they wanted to tell me, to ask me, and they were able to apologize to me for giving me up (which they didn\u2019t need to, I understood).

I can\u2019t imagine how hard it is and how scary it must be to face that but it is really important that she knows. If you tell her and she wants to keep talking, now you both are on the same page and can continue to foster your relationship without her unknowingly filling this need for closure for you. If you tell her and she\u2019s uneasy and doesn\u2019t want to then it\u2019s no longer a one sided ordeal where you\u2019re hoping for something to happen and you can both move on. I have a feeling it will be the former \ud83e\udd70 but you really do have to tell her.

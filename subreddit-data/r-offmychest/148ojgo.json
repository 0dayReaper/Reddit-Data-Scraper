    "postText": "this is actually very difficult for me. I'm 22F and my father passed away quite recently(7months ago) and I didn't deal with the pain when my mother broke the news to me. I got to know about it the next day as when it happened, i was sleeping in my hostel room in another State. and my mom called me all shaken up and just telling me to get home as soon as possible.\n\nI got home the next morning and I saw all of my relatives even the distant ones. My mom told me that my father had another paralysis attack (he's had two of them before) and i thought he would be admitted to a nearby hospital. Then my mon told me that he took his own life by hanging himself and no note left. Nothing. \n\nI didn't process it then and i can't process it now that he's actually gone as I was what you call is father's Princess. He always spoiled me and took my side and i always loved that. My mom loved and still loves him so much. I didn't cry as every other relative was telling my elder brother and me to be \"strong\".\nAnd i had to be stronger because my elder brother and mom aren't. I had to suppress my feelings and emotions and i did. My papa had a post mortem examination and to see him wrapped in plastic was brutal alongwith hid blood oozing out from his skull. He was cold as ice. \n\nI wanted to kiss him on the forehead because i always did when i kissed him good-night and I did.\n\nToday, I got my first paycheck and i was soooo elated. but it all vanished into thin air because i want to show this to my papa. But how do I? I can't make my heart and mind understand that he's watching me and my family and he's always proud of me. that is just settling the storm in my heart. I know he isn't here. His existence isn't here. I actually want him in mortal form but he ended his own life. What do I do?? \nI am happy that i am doing everything to make him proud but at the end of the day, he isn't here to see all this. and i know this sucks and i have to keep up with that until the end.",

Even if your father isn\u2019t here physically, he is with you in mind and soul. Im positive that your father would\u2019ve been proud of you as he always has been. Don\u2019t dwell and start to think about what you could\u2019ve done differently. that will only make things worse. Talk to someone. Don\u2019t carry your pain alone.",

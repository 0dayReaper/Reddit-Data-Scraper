    "postText": "Reddit and other social media platforms (which i\u2019ve been off for a while) only reinforce these views but I feel so out of place. All I see is people dividing people. \u201cMen are X, Women are Y\u201d it\u2019s just so draining to see. I wasn\u2019t asked to be born. Im just here. Why does everyone always feel the need to specify their gender or mine for that matter? I didn\u2019t even care but I hate being put into a box full of labels. I treat others how I would like to be treated but I don\u2019t seem to align with the majority of population clearly. Everyone\u2019s so determined to push their agendas and opinions which is fine whatever i\u2019m clearly the odd one out but for the love of god just stop trying to force me to join these views. I\u2019ve always been happy and accepting but as of late i\u2019ve been feeling down and so far from\neveryone around me and Reddit can be a super depressing place and I constantly see a battle of the sexes when I believe in equality true feminism. But whatever. I\u2019ll come back when I have a platform I feel comfortable in. Imma go build that. Peace out enjoy keeping hating on everyone who doesn\u2019t fit into \u201cthat\u201d box. I\u2019m tired i\u2019m gonna go take a long nap. Peace.",

    "postText": "Okay. i know the title seems iffy but please hear me out. \n\nI don\u2019t think my identity really matters just know i\u2019m young-ish..\n\nMy mom will literally force me and my older sister (sometimes my older brother when he\u2019s here) to go to her room strictly at 10:00pm to pray EVERY SINGLE DAY. If we somehow forget or fall asleep she will literally terrorize us saying \u201cgod is blah blah blah\u201d \u201cgod doesn\u2019t like when you avoid him\u201d like what??? i usually sleep around 9:00 these days cause school literally drains me to the core. She\u2019ll talk about how god is all she has in this world and she wouldn\u2019t have been yada yada without him and honestly i get it. I\u2019m not an atheist. I do believe god exists but my gosh, this is ALL she talks about. \n\nAnother thing is she met this wack job of a pastor, i\u2019ll call him C, (she\u2019s obsessed with him and calls him the man of god) who got in trouble after another pastor and his community exposed him for abandoning his child. Everytime i bring this situation up she\u2019ll get soooooo angry and say how i don\u2019t know anything and i should stop talking. C asked my mom and her community to help him buy another church, they helped him buy the church but he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know where it is\u201d. C also asked my mom and her community to donate money to buy him a ticket to where ever the hell and she contributed $300 after lying to me saying she only gave him $20. I honestly hate C because he disrespected my sister and her outfit, saying god would not approve of her outfit choice and some other weird shit, and my mom was quiet as a bird, didn\u2019t even try to defend my sister. I was wayy younger that time so I didn\u2019t really understand what he was saying. \n\nAnything C wants, my mother and their stupid fraud of a community will help him purchase. My mother literally worships C and god. Another hypocritical thing is my mom would tell us that she has money problems which is a lie because how is it that you\u2019re helping aid this man left to right at every chance you get? She also forces C upon us, to the point where me and my sister do not like him. She yelled at my sister earlier today because she didn\u2019t want C to \u201cbless\u201d her new car meaning he has to take it and drive it to \u201cthe church\u201d they \u201cbought\u201d and dash \u201choly oil\u201d on it. Saying how my sister isn\u2019t ordain and her \u201clittle prayer\u201d won\u2019t bless her car unless C \u201cthe man of god\u201d does.\n\nAnyway, I just needed to let that out.",

Once you are able to set your own life structure independently, do it Nike. \n\nOften belief in God is a result of one\u2019s recognition that in life there is uncertainty which one cannot address by any other means. \n\nA parent would therefore want to share the most  effictive way to address life\u2019s uncertainty. \n\nBut sometime people unknowingly over do it\u2026 like making super long posts on Reddit",

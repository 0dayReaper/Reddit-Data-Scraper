    "postText": "I am 18, and my primary issue is my grass pollen allergy that is seasonal though I am allergic to other things minimally. I have ADHD which can be a big problem in my focus, and anxiety which I assume causes my organizational issues and OCD'ness.\n\nI have a great skill in Lua programming but have also looked into learning C (I don't think I'll ever learn it). I understand a lot of bash &amp; batch but am really ambitious on advanced languages.\n\nI have seen quite a bit of traumatizing content online, mostly around ages 15 to now (18). I also have a very problematic impulsive disorder where I cannot help but drop offensive language over the internet repeatedly. I don't talk to girls in public, and when I meet a girl online, they're always under 18.\n\nI suppose I am just the average young male who is struggling to fit into society. Dating is pointless to my perspectives though I understand the overall health benefits. My last relationship (online) was ridiculous and showed me an example of the horrible person I was. I took complete advantage of my opportunities to be sexually driven. It was merely all impulse and I know I never really loved her. Girls really have nothing to offer when you meet them online, so I suppose my only advice would be to go out in the real world, but I'm a lost cause who is nearly 300 lbs and has no courage to get off my ass and workout. Small steps? My ass! Literally, my ass is probably the largest portion of fat in my body.\n\nMy dad (not biological) was a combat medic in Iraq, in his early 40s, who has traumatic brain injury, PTSD, auditory processing disorder, he is not deaf but does have hearing loss, tinnitus, a skin condition where his skin peels all the time (most likely from the chemicals contracted from combat), jaw problems (potential misalignment), spinal problems like buldging disks, back pain, kyphosis, spinal canal narrowing (stenosis), labral tears on both hips, one of his legs is longer than the other one, and one of his feet are \"inflated\" in a sense as if it's under inflammation. He prefers glasses in order to see at night while driving, and while using LED technology.\n\nDealing with my dad is fine but it took me a while to adapt to his rules because he tends to have more fumes when he gets upset. I appreciate this, honestly, because it puts me in a place where I can improve.\n\nMy mom, who is also in her early 40s, has TMD (jaw problems), muscle(s) in her right shoulder that \"sticks\" to her tendons. Hypertension (though is resolvable with a diet), high blood pressure, flat feet.\n\nMy mom and dad have both been veterans, though my dad has really been more in combat and has seen things (like dead bodies and stuff) being the combat medic he was. My mom was never really was in actual combat because of her job in logistics in the US Army.\n\nAnyways, I've been dreaming of living independantly but I don't think that'd be a smart move. I primarily just want to be alone because I am almost convinced there's little hope for my future. Maybe these thoughts are outdated, but I remember I packed 3,000 calories worth of junk food in less than 2 hours today.\n\nWell, I guess that's all. I doubt anyone will see, read, or care about this because it was merely a venting solution. Nobody ever cares until there's a problem, so here's mine.",

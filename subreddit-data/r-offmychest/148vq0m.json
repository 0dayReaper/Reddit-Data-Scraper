    "postText": "Hi! I'm writing on mobile, so excuse the spacing~\n\nAll my childhood, I grew up as a gifted kid. I was top of the class, honor roll, all A's, you name it. My parents were incredibly proud of me, and constantly bragged about me to anyone and everyone they could. They had big dreams for me, and I had some pretty big ones myself. Of course, I was a child then.\n\nWhen high school started, I experienced severe burnout coupled with some mental illness (not going into specifics here). My grades dropped, and fast. I passed every class, no problem, but I got a C or two as the final grade in some. Things got hard. I stopped expecting an A and went to hoping for a B. Not all of my classes were like this, but there were enough that I knew it wasn't good enough anymore.\n\nI started hiding report cards, telling lies, and doing anything I could to make my parents brush past the bad grades. It worked, and I recently graduated with a 3.7 GPA. After seeing how much I struggled through high school, I knew college would be terrible for me, so I made the decision in my senior year to join the military. However, I'm overweight, so I had a couple more steps to take before joining. I spoke with recruiters, started working out, and even dieted for a bit to start the process.\n\nAll that was left was to tell my parents.\n\nAt first, they were confused. How could I want to do that instead of going to college? But then, they were supportive. They said it was my life, so I can do what I want, and at least I'd be healthy and safe. After that, the subject dropped and I'm continuing to work on getting my weight down.\n\nLast night, however, I heard my parents talking about me. My dad said hearing that I wanted to join the military instead of going to college was the \"biggest kick in the teeth of his life\" and was upset I wasn't following the path he and my mom had built for me. He even called me ungrateful for not doing so. He then blamed my girlfriend, saying it was her fault I didn't want to leave for college. (As if the military isn't a bigger commitment than college?) And then he wondered if I was even planning to join at all. My mom was mostly quiet, just saying that she was disappointed in me for \"throwing all that potential away like this.\" She was also upset that I \"wasn't doing anything with my life.\"\n\nSo now, I'm writing this out with conflicted feelings. I'm mad because they were supportive to my face, and then immediately say I'm a disappointment when I'm not around. I feel a little bad because I know they just want to see me happy and successful. But I'm also confused as to why they don't think I'd have a good life in the military. I'm at a loss right now. All I know is I need some distance from them for a while.",

Whatever turmoil you had during your high school days remember what you went through is not your fault\n\nSecondly, now you heard everything consider that you may have uncovered their true colours. Behind closed doors all along they are may be treating you as an extension of themselves and could have been bragging to their friends about you while you are kept in the dark about it\n\nOP, I understand you feel sad but please do not let their disappointment affect your decisions. You not going to university does not mean you are wasting your talent and potential. Do not listen to them and just do you. \n\nIt does not matter whether you head to military school, go to uni or even take a year off to volunteer and work part-time, you are not wasting anything at all but making use of your time wisely. There is no set timeline either when you will graduate or be successful. You do what works for you and you alone decide what is best for you",

That said, it looks like you may have dodged a lot of red flags in regards to your parents trying to exert control over you.\n\nMake your life what you want it to be and choose your own path. Pleasing your parents will not do you any favors in the long run.",

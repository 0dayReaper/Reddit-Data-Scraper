I am open to therapy but don\u2019t know how to find a therapist, I also can\u2019t afford that much so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s within my reach right now. Lately a lot of trauma from my childhood has been coming back to me and I don\u2019t know how to deal with it. I also don\u2019t know if I am right to feel this way or if I am being unfair to my family for being angry at them, because I only have my point of view.",

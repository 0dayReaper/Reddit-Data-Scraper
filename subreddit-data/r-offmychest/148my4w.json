    "postText": "I (30somethingM) have gotten into probably the best shape of my life, I\u2019ve never been in really bad shape I\u2019ve been around 230 down to 180lbs my life. I took MMA for several years, but I digress. I\u2019m not delusional about my appearance I would say I\u2019m average looking a 5ish/10 depending upon if you like dudes with long hair and beard. But, since I\u2019ve spent a while going to the gym most of the week every week for probably 2 years now (went from 230 before gym to 238 now after a bulk) but now I\u2019ve noticed some ladies are checking me out in a not-so-subtle way (one time at the gym this girl was on a leg curl machine bending herself sideways to look at me the only person in front of her in a \u201cwarmup-stretching area\u201d another at a bar gave me extended eye contact and huge smile as she slowly walked like a foot in front of me in a big not crowded bar. Last one I can think of was a girl who gawked at me mouth agape like I just descended on a flaming chariot.) My response is generally the same a stunned me in my head, \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d \u201cIs there someone/thing behind me?\u201d. I grew up kinda awkward and generally average looking, and for whatever reason after it clicks in my brain I\u2019m like, \u201cOooooooohhh\u2026.. really?\u201d Am I the only one who feels like that?",

Tbh I was failing biology in highschool, what saved me is I wasn\u2019t the only student failing, so he couldn\u2019t fail us all. He ended up giving us extra credit. It goes a long way if you tell your principal and show that you have been trying (how you already had a discussion with your sci teacher however many times). This is how you learn to do your homework on time and study for tests\u2014you aren\u2019t in college yet, but they are exactly like your teacher and won\u2019t allow this. Ask what you can do, anything you can do, because you don\u2019t want to repeat the year and the stress/consequences has gotten to you.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t work out. Take it as a lesson and don\u2019t repeat the same mistakes. At least you\u2019ll know what the assignments are and can help out the rest of the class.",

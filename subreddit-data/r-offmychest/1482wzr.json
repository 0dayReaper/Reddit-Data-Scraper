    "postText": "After getting out of a miserable and mentally abusive 4 year relationship. My son and I will be moving into my boyfriends house. Who(whom?) has been my best friend for the last 8 years.  I asked him in march to be my BF! He loves my son and watching their relationship grow has been amazing to see. He will call just to speak to him (our(?) son is only 1.5y/o). He says \u201che didn\u2019t come from me but he is mine.\u201d This is the healthiest relationship I\u2019ve ever been in, it almost feels weird. Growing up in an abusive home I just always expect chaos. \nMy job was mentally draining , and my boss is abusing their power. I was raising my son alone for a year and a half. And I mean alone, we moved STATES for this awful job. So I was alone alone, no family or friends near by. The stress was getting to me. I was a rich poor person so I couldn\u2019t even get the help I so desperately needed. My son always had food and never went without, But man it is hard out there. \nToday I quit my job, we move on Saturday four hours away to our new home. Our new start. My son now has a front and back yard, chickens, a garden and another dog. And most importantly a dad, someone I can actually depend on. I got a job that is exactly what I want to do and isn\u2019t \u201ccorporate\u201d. My heart is so full.",

After failed past relationships I married one of my best friends and our relationship is wonderful.  I've also read this (and other) subreddit(s) for a long time and this post terrifies me.  I don't know what to do with my hands.",

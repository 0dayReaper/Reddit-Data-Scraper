Like the comment above yours, the DNC already endorsed Biden, who has already been proven corrupt. \n\nThe current system was designed to make you believe in democracy in hopes you don't know what is actually going on, and instills pride in your sense of self when you identify and interact with it. Red Vs Blue was a better YouTube show for sure, and its way better to watch than this facade we call a government.\n\nBernie essentially stirred the pot in a bunch of people and got a ton of money doing it, knowing all of this. Although I believe he cashed out in the right way, by waking a few people up in the process. I believe he had the spirit of what some people see as a bigger-than-us future.\n\nThe power to vote is kind of pointless if the votes go into a big bag of ignored anecdotes. We now have no one to speak for us, and I say us as hearts not as people. My only suggestion is to speak more casually as to how we can unite ideas towards a better future once these old dirt bags are out.",

We're back to where we were 4 years ago, stuck voting between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. I don't like it one bit, but at the end of the day I am still going to vote for the one I find less shitty, because my vote DOES count. \n\nYou're insinuating that there is a huge conspiracy in this country that our democracy isn't real, and that claim is unfounded, unproven, and a dangerous ideology. \n\nIt's like that John Mayer song goes, \"Waiting on the World to Change\". As generations of people continue to flow through this country, the ideologies and values of following generations will be represented by who is in power, and things will slowly change. THAT is how our government was designed from the start. SLOW change. That kinda sucks in this day and age because of how fast our world has become and how quickly we need to address certain issues (such as climate change, healthcare, and social services). But I have faith that in time we will see administrations much more representative of our values and needs. \n\nReddit is a strange place to talk politics because most of us fall within the same (younger) age groups, of which represent the two smallest voting blocs. It's easy to feel disenfranchised here because everyone here is pissed off to some degree, whether you're a dem or a rep. I personally am encouraged by the success of Bernie and others like him (even if they didn't get the nomination) because it represents a changing of values of the American people, and it's a sign that the Baby Boomers are losing their grip on voting power. \n\nIt's not a giant conspiracy.\n\nHave a little faith in the system.",

I watched a lot of people switch from skeptic to believer after a single sitting hearing how this stuff actually works.\n\nAs someone who has had extensive experience in both systems including running a business. The Nordic country I lived in was absolutely amazing in terms of how many ancillary benefits emerged in addition to explicit ones. While no country is perfect they have done a lot of the hard work of figuring this stuff out. \n\nWhat gives me hope is that despite enormous efforts by MSM, the mainline Democratic Party and the GOP, a significant part of the country embraced these ideas.  What gives me hope is that it appears as long as we fight to expose people to the reality of these policies working in other nations we will continue to grow. \n\nTo paraphrase Princess Leia:\nNo matter how much this administration tries to squeeze us, more and more will slip through its fingers.",

The Kennedy center gets $25 million. Oh, and GM just got a $500 million contract to make ventilators. But they care about us, right?\n\nStop thinking that we are anything but indentured servants to Washington, and maybe we can change things. Stop letting them divide us, because that\u2019s what they want. It\u2019s way easier to maintain control when the ignorant masses are too busy fighting each other.",

We are constantly bombarded with stories about race, sexism, religion, etc. that rile people up and keep us fighting against our fellow citizens so we are too busy hating each other to even realize what the very few at the top and in control are doing. They know if enough of us caught on and united against them, we would have enough power to make a difference. So they work hard to make sure we never even get close.",

I feel it applies here Too:\n\nI voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary and yes, it's been disappointing to see the tide turning against him and his chances of winning slowly but surely slipping away.\n\nYou know what else is disappointing? How low the youth vote has been. I have kids, a full-time job, and plenty more, and I still found time to go vote for him. I did my part! Where were all the rest of you \"supporters?\" You need to do more than just post supportive memes on Facebook. You actually have to show up.\n\nWhat I'm even more disappointed in, though, are all the people I'm seeing on Reddit/Faceboot/etc who are falling right back into \"my guy lost so fuck the whole thing\" or \"I won't vote for anyone but Bernie.\" Do any of you remember 2016? Have you all forgotten that deep-pitted feeling of existential dread you felt when you realized Trump won?\n\nThe states that handed him the victory? He won those by something like 10,000 votes. The margins were thin. People like you who stayed home and moped? You helped to hand him the power to cage children, deregulate our environment, and strip-mine the government for the benefit of the rich. How much worse do you think it's going to be if he gets to stay in office for another four years? You're fools if you think a Biden presidency would be worse or \"the same\".\n\nJoe Biden isn't the guy I want in the White House. The \"centrist\" Democrats who support him? They, by and large, don't have the same values I do. But they're not as bad as Trump, or the Republicans, and you need to stop complaining and be god-damned grown ups and realize that.\n\nI mean, did we grow up watching different movies or something? Did you miss the part in all those inspirational films where the good guys keep trying, EVEN THOUGH THEY LOSE? They usually lose a lot before anything good happens. It's called perseverance. Get some. Keep fighting and elect local officials who can lay a foundation for the change you wanted Sanders to deliver.",

                    "comment": "Yes the system needs to change into something like the Democratic primaries where electoral college votes are allotted proportionately. Although I don't know how much that would've changed things. Trump won big in Red states and snatched a lot of the \"Blue Wall\" states. But the Blue states have massive populations, Hillary crushed Trump in NY and California. She would've gotten the same amount of electoral votes or nearly the same amount as Trump in Florida, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. And Trump would've gotten more in Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, Virginia. He would've gotten a few votes from California and NY which won't be a small amount. So it would've been close.\n\nNonetheless, If we want the system to change, we need to win elections. That is something the Republicans have understood and they're appointing supreme court justices, other federal justices in consequential courts, drawing district maps in crucial states such as Florida, winning senate seats in purple states like Florida and pushing the agenda of evangelicals in state legislatures to keep their votes. \n\nWe can build a progressive movement and nudge this country on a progressive path again. But, in order for that to happen, we've got to win presidential elections, we've got to win Gubernotorial elections, we've got to win state legislatures and we've got to appoint supreme court justices. Its gonna be a long process but its possible. Winning this election would be a start. It'll be slow change but it'll be incremental and we will get there eventually. Welcome to a Democracy :)",

March 3rd was just as the current pandemic was picking up speed. It would be classified as a pandemic by the WHO the next week. Soon after, orders to stay home were in place across the country. They closed polling stations before Super Tuesday so just casting a vote was confusing and difficult, especially for first-time or recently relocated voters (usually young, renters, students, or a combination). Couple that with the fact that we\u2019ve been fucked by moderates in most of the elections many of us are old enough to remember - Nader, Gore losing to W, and of course 2016 (I\u2019m 30, but younger voters also remember W beating Al Gore and 2016).\n\nAt this point it seems like the people in power are just fine with letting voters risk dying to wait outside in storms for hours in a worsening pandemic to vote. This isn\u2019t a conspiracy, it\u2019s quite literally happening right out in the open.\n\nOn top of all that, the youths are disinterested in what the current climate is offering them and disillusioned with the process. Not to mention, it\u2019s hard to get out and vote when you don\u2019t have PTO and can\u2019t get off work to vote in the primary (which, if you\u2019re not registered as a Democrat, you have to do in person in some states). I was able to vote, as were many I know, but we\u2019re lucky that our location in California was easily accessible. A lot of the time it isn\u2019t.\n\nThis is a multi-faceted failure of the system (of which the voters are a part), nothing less.",

COVID was not part of the national narrative, no one was seriously talking about it's impact to the election, America in general. It was still an abstract thought, especially in the states that voted. Now moving on...\n\nYou're telling me that the most technologically savvy generation can't pull up a website and stay informed on where they need to vote? Can't get clear on the process to register? Yes, I know the arguments that the younger generation is more transient and registering has so many rules to follow, but this didn't sneak up on *anybody*. This is the part that really pisses me off. This has been in the national narrative for *years*. Even if voting *IS* harder as a 20y/o, the task isn't so dramatically more difficult that you still couldn't vote with a little extra effort.\n\nWarren was my preferred candidate but was very closely watching what Sanders was doing. You can check my post history, I continued to say \"if we see a giant surge in youth voting, then I think the guy has a shot\". ***Everything*** **was riding on Super Tuesday**. The narrative was clear: the youth vote needed to turn out in great numbers in order to counteract the defections from more conservative moderates who were anti-Bernie. If that surge manifested, then the broader Democratic coalition would have been at least somewhat reassured: \"maybe he *can* win!\". Remember that the most often cited trait in a candidate was to Beat Trump, and Sanders does alienate a lot of people (let's not argue as to why he does, just accepting the fact that a lot of people don't like what he's proposing).\n\nSo with the stakes clearly sky-high, and the rules of the game clearly stated, the youth didn't show up. The morning after ST, I thought to myself \"if they won't show up for Bernie after all this, then they won't show up at all\". I knew it was going to be a consolidated moderate candidate that won from that moment forward. Whether it was Pete, Biden, or Klobuchar, one of them was going to consolidate. From a political game theory perspective, Biden was the best choice of those three because of his broader appeal to the AA community, as well as his legit shot of winning back Pennsylvania. Not an inspiring candidate, but the candidate with the best path to victory.\n\nAnd to quickly touch on the Electoral College. I don't like it and do wish we just had the popular vote. But to think that someone didn't really win an election because the didn't win the popular vote is a bad argument because those weren't the rules of the game. You know the rules going in, and you strategize and make your plan for victory based on those rules. It's not unlike Pacman, where to make the leaderboard, it's all about points. Nothing on the Top 10 screen shows how many levels the player reached, just the raw point total. Complaining about the EC is like saying \"I didn't get the most points, but I cleared more levels! I should win because I got to a higher level than the person who just happens to get more points!\" But the person who got more points may have done so because they were deliberately chasing the ghosts better, chasing down the fruit and extra points stuff, because they knew that's how you win.\n\nAnyway, I just realized that I just said way too much. I'll stop now.",

For clarification, I\u2019m not referring to registering or figuring out how/when to vote. Polling places were closed when it was stated they\u2019d be open, which led to a lot of confusion and long lines at the places that were open. I don\u2019t have firsthand experience with it since I\u2019m in LA and my voting experience was incredibly easy (also I\u2019m not really \u201cthe youth\u201d anymore, but I know quite a few). Outside of our county and in other states, though, that had a big impact. If your polling place is closed when the last time you checked it was your assigned place, then you have to find your new polling place and get there, *then* there\u2019s a 4 hour line, it starts to logistically stack the deck against you. You may be able to get to your new polling place around work, but having to wait for hours makes it way more difficult logistically to get your vote in. In the real world, it quickly stacks up to be impossible. Add in prohibitive voter ID measures and you\u2019ve taken out a lot of the progressive vote, though definitely not just the younger crowd.\n\nStill, that\u2019s only a part of it. Lower voter turnout had a big impact, and younger progressives *did* need to turn out more. Still, saying it\u2019s on young voters that this campaign failed and not a more complicated issue oversimplifies it and gives other voters/supporters a convenient scapegoat so we don\u2019t work on changing a system that limits the voting power of large groups of people. It also further alienates younger voters who feel caught in an impossible system, then blamed when results are announced, which I feel is pretty understandable.\n\nYou did say a lot, but you make perfect sense and I agree with a lot of your points.

Most political scientists predicted Bernie would lose, and Yang was never even part of the equation, because the fact of the matter is the word \"socialist\" is still pretty poisonous in American politics. Bernie's campaign did a lot to alleviate that, so good on him. \n\nThe problem is America's voting system which pretty much stacks the deck against anyone who isn't an American political centrist. The solution is to change that voting system to give people the freedom to vote for who they actually want, rather than who they think has the best chance of winning over who they *don't* want which will always turn out to be the lesser of two evils on both sides of the political spectrum, since those are the two most centrist candidates. \n\nIf you think that every election has been like that, you'd be right since that's basically what the system ends up doing. But it's important not to lose hope and give in to cynicism, that never really helps anyone. Just keep voting for who you think is best for you and your country out of the remaining candidates, that's all anyone can do.",

You realize you\u2019re talking about the difference between Joe Biden, someone who supports moving in the directions that you\u2019re more pronounced policy preferences are in, and instead saying that you would rather have another term of Donald Trump? That is literally, unequivocally what you\u2019re saying. I understand you don\u2019t like the options. I don\u2019t like them either. Did I want Bernie? Absolutely. But will someone who I might not necessarily like specifically, but that I think will be way more on my side of the fence be at least better than the alternative? Absolutely. You\u2019re giving me a whole bunch of superfluous reasons about why you don\u2019t want to support him, but none of them are related to things that he will affect if he\u2019s president. Come on! If you hold the police that you do, then how on earth can you say that you would rather someone be elected who believes in 0% of the things that you believe in, instead of someone who believes in a lot of the things that you do, just maybe not to the level that you do? If you can say that, it means you don\u2019t hold any of those opinions and believes anyway. They\u2019re obviously not that important.",

If you genuinely believe that Biden and Trump are the same and have no preference toward either, then that's fine, that's your right. But if you see either of them as the lesser of two evils, then you should vote for them. More importantly, remember the outcome of these elections that don't give people the freedom to vote for who they want but rather incentivises people to vote against who they don't want, and demand better from your elected representatives. Try your best not to give in to cynicism, that never really helps anyone.",

What I\u2019m trying to say is because we can vote we are all politicians in a sense, and like politicians we need to think strategically. I would rather have had Andrew Yang in office, and you would rather have Bernie, but neither will happen, so we would be wise to take the closest we can get to our ideal leader, so we get the closest we can get to having our preferred policies passed.",

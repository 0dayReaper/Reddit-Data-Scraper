    "postText": "My wedding is cancelled, my fianc\u00e9 has left, She took are dog and are car and now\u2026 now I got nothing. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do now. She\u2019s all I\u2019ve known and done things for these past 2 1/2 years. We moved across the country to get out of her parents basement cause it was hard to be a couple when your living with in-laws. We thought all our problems were going to be solved once we moved out. It only made things worse, she went into a deep state of depression and homesickness that I thought we could work through it. She didn\u2019t even give this new city a chance. She started to blame all are problems on me when I was the only one working and keeping us afloat. I did everything for her. I payed for everything with no thanks. We weren\u2019t even struggling financially. We always had money for food, date nights and mall shopping sprees but I guess it wasn\u2019t enough. She acted like I ripped her away from her family when it was her idea to move out here cause her family was driving her crazy. I tried my hardest to make her happy but it never worked. My biggest fear was losing her and it happened. I loved her more than anything. So now I\u2019m all alone in a new city across the country from any family and friends with nothing.",

    "postText": "For context, I (41F) married my husband 12 years ago. We have 4 kids (17F, 15M, 11M, 8F). My two oldest are from a previous relationship and my husband has raised them since they were 4yrs and 2yrs old. My sister in law (32F) also has 4 kids, all girls (16, 14, 8 and 5). All these conversations took place during different family celebrations ( we don\u2019t hang out with her much unless it\u2019s some family gathering). \n\nMy oldest daughter and I were talking about her birth control and maybe switching it and trying a different one. \u201cYoung girls shouldn\u2019t be on birth control, it messes with their bodies too much, gives them a free pass to sex and it makes them gain weight. I\u2019m not putting any of my girls on it. Isn\u2019t she gay anyways? No need for birth control.\u201d \u201cWell\u2026.there\u2019s a lot of things in this world that I can not prevent from happening to my children- getting pregnant before they want to be is one thing I can and I will. And yep, she\u2019s gay. Still don\u2019t think she\u2019d want to have her rapists baby if, god forbid, something like that happened.\u201d What I wanted to say: \u201cYeah, you know what else makes you gain weight?- fucking pregnancy\u201d - while pointing to her pregnant 16 year old daughter. \n\nMy father in law had a pregnant cat and my youngest daughter (8) asked me how she got pregnant. \u201cShe had sex with a boy cat.\u201d \u201cOh, so it\u2019s the same as people?\u201d \u201cYes. Pretty much all babies are made from sex between boys and girls.\u201d  My sister in law stand up in a huff \u201cYou can\u2019t tell her that! That\u2019s not ok! You\u2019re ruining her innocence! You need to keep her innocent as long as you can. That\u2019s wrong!!\u201d \u201cMy 8yr old knows age appropriate descriptions of things and I\u2019ve always used the correct words for all sexual conversations. Being informed doesn\u2019t make her lose her innocence.\u201d What I wanted to say: \u201cYou know what really makes a child lose their innocence? Having their mother in prison for 5 months for meth or maybe when you lost custody of your 8 year old to your Aunt or maybe your 14yr old being dumped at her Dads house in a different state or your 16 year old being pregnant makes a child lose their innocence. You literally only have custody of 1 out of 4 of your kids- sit the fuck down.\u201d",

This way you can also have a good night sleep knowing if anything happens to your children at a young age, they know what it is and they\u2019d be able to tell you exactly what happened. \n\nAnd I think you should say that. Or something along those lines, like sarcastically that she\u2019s the right person to talk about parenting.",

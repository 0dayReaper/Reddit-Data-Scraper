    "postText": "I (28M) remember a 2003ish family visit when I was 8 or 9 years old and a step-cousin who I think is one year older than me. There were three kids, (myself, other male relative, and female step-cousin) and we slept side by side in our grandparents' living room at nights. I don't remember exactly what happened, but at one point my step-cousin thought I was asleep and moved her hand underneath my blanket and started feeling my stomach area. At one point, she moved her hand down to my privates and I don't remember how long she lingered there but I don't think she did much beyond groping. She then took my own wrist and placed my hand on her own midsection and moved my hand around. I don't remember exactly what happened. At some point I stirred (made it clear I'm awake) and asked her where she was touching me and she said \"I don't know\" in kind of an embarrassed way. We eventually went back to sleep and not much else happened to my recollection. I'm pretty sure I had an erection. She \"wet herself\" and then went to ask my mom to change her or something, wanted me to wake her up. I remember that. Something similar happened a few years later like 2006-07? and I resisted when she tried to move my hand down below her belly. During the day we roughhoused a lot and it was good fun, parents saw us doing that but not what happened at night.\n\n\r  \nI'd been refraining from talking about this with anyone for so long because I didn't stop it, I enjoyed it in a certain way, she was/is only one year older than me. Nothing about this story even seems that severe or traumatic (groping, no penetration or even skin-to-skin hand/genitalia contact that I remember).\n\n\r  \nI have anxiety, depression, OCD and I'm trying to wrack my brain and put my symptoms in context of when this happened and I remember having bad anxiety and constantly worrying as a kid starting in around 2003. I remember feeling guilty about things that weren't even plausible like, if a kid fell down near me I would somehow worry I caused it. I would step on ethernet cords in our house and feel guilty about it and confess to my parents that I \"purposely stepped on the cord\" to their confusion and eventual frustration because of just how weird the situation was. I don't even remember if I stepped on them on purpose like an intrusive thought or convinced myself after it was on purpose. I remember learning about STD's in middle school and worrying \"Oh no what if I got some latent STD's from (Girl's name) or got her pregnant) even though this was 4-5 years later. Just completely illogical gaslighting myself stuff. Ridiculous catastrophizing like this.\n\n\r  \nI am debating whether I should bring this up to my parents (I still live with them) and I don't want them to freak out but they seem like level-headed loving people. They are aware of my anxiety and confidence issues but not this. I remember telling them soon after it happened \"\\[Girl's name\\] was kissing my fingers\" because she did that but I didn't know how to articulate the other stuff. \r  \nI am scheduling a psychiatric appointment to talk with someone about this. The person who touched me is not someone I have seen in a long time nor do I expect to ever see them again.\n\n\r  \nDo you think I developed anxiety disorders based on this happened? Maybe I was an anxious person and this just exacerbated it? I'm a shy person; I don't know if I would be were it not for this. Part of me hates acknowledging this happened and that it affected me because it's like, if it affected my development that much, then I missed out on so many non-stressful experiences and years that I could've had and I'll never get them back. I'm going back to college at 28 now and am trying for a bachelor degree in mechanical engineering. I am doing well in my classes. I've had jobs before (held one for three years) and can generally get along well with people but then there's the anxiety stuff holding me back from some other things.\n\n\r  \nI keep reading wikipedia pages about child-on-child abuse and whatnot and a lot of it seems to fit what my approach to the situation is (blaming myself for not stopping it, not saying \"no\", I don't think she even understood what she was doing) and a lot of the long-term effects on victims seem to match issues that I'm currently experiencing. \n\n\r  \nWell, I would appreciate any advice, or if anyone can relate. Could some incident like that even cause me so much trauma or am I just naturally anxious, or both? I don't want to consider myself a \"child sexual abuse victim\" because that makes it seem like it defines me and it wasn't that intense. Did I just mentally catastrophize something that's common between kids? It would bring me a lot of comfort to know if anyone is in a similar boat or if you have any knowledge about situations like this. \n\n\r  \nReasons I think this is coming back to me\r  \n1.\tI've been trying to wean myself off Zoloft (been on since 2010) because I got tired of having to jump through hoops to get prior authorization to get my meds. I was also upset being on meds kept me from joining the Space Force. So I'd gone from like 200mg/day a year ago down to 150, 100, 50 and then 0 a month ago.\r  \n2.\tI am going back to university after a long break and touring the campus at orientation was a reminder of what could've been (attended before and dropped out, hey at least my old classes are still valid) and how long it's been since I last attended there (8-10 years) and just made me profoundly sad and also anxious. I began really wracking my brain to find out why I was anxious and it came back to this. \r  \n3.\tIt's been about 5 days since university orientation and I've had trouble eating and sleeping since. My head feels hot with pangs of guilt and worry. I have leftover zoloft that I'm starting to take again and I'm gonna talk with a psychiatrist about this so I can get back on a regular dose. I've been able to bury this anxiety before but it's back with a vengeance.\n\n\r  \nApologies for repeating myself in several paragraphs.",

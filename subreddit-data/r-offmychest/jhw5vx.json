What kind of sense does this make?",

Doing so would force Breyer and Thomas into retirement, and Biden could replace Thomas with a liberal justice, bringing the court to a more reasonable 5-4 conservative majority instead of 6-3 and hopefully Democrats would get to choose the replacements for Roberts and Alito eventually.",

Most are not in line with how the country feels about issues.  This country is founded on a promise of equality but SCOTUS doesn't interpret the law based on equality, they base it on their religious beliefs.  That is absolutely wrong.  We need term limits so these out of touch judges can be replaced.  If they were interpreting the law based on only the law then there would be no question about LGBTQ discrimination or discrimination against women's health care issue.   No one should be able to use THEIR religious beliefs to refuse rights or refuse to provide health care or medications to women.  They're out of touch.  \n\nTerm limits for Congress and Senate aren't really needed.   They aren't voted in for life and every 2-4 years they need to seek re-election.  Their voters get to determine if they deserve another term.   The real problem isn't the term, it's the gerrymandering and voter suppression.   If we fix those issues and ban changes, then the voters get to choose.  If Kentucky voters fairly chooses someone like McConnell then that's their choice.  The problem is, it isn't fair right now.",

For example, my employer covers 100% of the monthly premiums for me so if I didn't visit the doctor my health insurance would be free. But if I did get in an accident and my surgeon wasn't in network id be on the hook for 50% of the bill.

I get really upset when I hear that the insurance company either denied a claim or declined to authorize a procedure because they think they might lose money on it. I can tell a whole lot of stories where procedures were denied and than it came back the patient got worse or they died. I can't tell you how many claims I have seen (mostly) women and children being denied a procedure they desperately needed. It is sickening.\n\nI am in favor of expanding Medicaid but that program needs to be overhauled. I would happily pay more in taxes to see our most vulnerable people get healthcare they need.\n\nThere is no reason why an aspirin given at the hospital should be a $50 charge on an itemized bill.",

We have socialized medicine or universal healthcare, which basically means that public hospitals are free. You don\u2019t pay into it as health insurance. Because hospitals are already funded by tax money, just like the post office and the police.\n\nYou just call an ambulance (also free) and stay in the hospital until you are well. And you only get charge a little bit for things like syringes or non-critical medication.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know why things cost the price they cost in America, even tho I lived there for a good portion of my life. I believe drug prices are unregulated, which is the main reason for the price hike. If Martin Skereli pulled the shit he pulled in Europe, he would be going to jail so fast.\n\nAs what to fund the hospitals with, I dunno, spend a little less on the military and stop bailing out failing corporations, I guess. In the EU we tax the rich just as much as they do the middle class. And most of our hospitals run fine (except the UK the NHS suck because they keep cutting funds); and HK is a bit of a special case because our government\u2019s main source if income isn\u2019t tax, but investment in land/corporations/other governments etc..",

In comparison, an orthopaedic surgeon working purely privately can earn 10x that pay easily (i.e. \u00a31 million per year).\n\nIt's a sad truth but understandable.

Sure, everyone will have access, but what will that do when the few good doctors, nurses, and other care technicians who are left after the financial purge are spread too thin to provide the quality of care we\u2019re all used to?\nTake a look at what hospitals in \u201cuniversal\u201d healthcare countries actually look like.

    "postText": "I want to vent because I cant relate to anybody. Co-workers at work, friends that I already have, and so on. I have a different personality for everyone and I hate acting in different ways to fit everyone's playbook. It always ends up in failure or cringe. So i just shut up. I have a very goofy side of me which is the real me, but if i acted this way with any other friend they would cut me off. No one likes that version of me.  Im appreciative of having one friend that likes that about me. I feel like my brain works differently than everyone else.",

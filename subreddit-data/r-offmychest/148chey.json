    "postText": "I have been with my boyfriend for nearly 5 years, living together for 3. We are both in our mid-twenties. \n\nCurrently on holiday and I have come to a realisation that I cannot carry on- the abusive insults, the financial support I have to give, nothing is worth it anymore. \n\nAbsolutely terrified, I relocated to a new city for him, and my job has a three month notice period, but I can\u2019t continue like this anymore. \n\nI have nothing else to give, this relationship is draining everything that makes me, \u2018me\u2019, and I hate that I don\u2019t recognise myself.",

I feel that all my interests are his, and whilst to some degree I assume that\u2019s true, it\u2019ll be nice to see what else I like. I was only 20 when I met him, a student and didn\u2019t even have a driving licence. I can\u2019t wait to see what \u2018adult\u2019 me is actually like. I wish him the best but like you say, it\u2019s better to walk away, for both of our sakes",

Yeah he consistently puts me down, insults me, emotionally isolates me (your own parents don\u2019t even like you, you have no friends, etc), which is so so hard. I\u2019m having to wait until I get home which is really hard, but I\u2019m going to persevere and put myself first! Thanks for much!",

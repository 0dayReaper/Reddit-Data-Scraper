    "postText": "T.K.O Quasi perceptual imagery by your Aphantasia\n\nTactile imagery:\n\n\ufeffTactile imagery appeals to the sense of touch. \nThe feeling of a nice fuzzy blanket on a cold night, the smooth underside of a snake, the rough texture of tree bark. \nAnything you touch, you can describe through imagery. \nThe description of a bare hand on a mound of snow could be described as, \u201cSarah placed her bare hand on the cold snow. \nIt was wet at first, then the frigid cold set in like a thousand needles, all pricking her palm at once.\u201d\n\nKinesthetic imagery:\n\nThese last two types of imagery extend beyond the five senses. \nKinesthetic imagery deals with the movement or action of objects or people. \nAn example of kinesthetic imagery could be, \u201cThe birds flapped their wings in excitement, the promise of food so close. \nThey sprung out of the tree, one by one, soaring through the branches and swooping down low to the pile of berries beneath the tree.\u201d \nThe description of the way the birds fly down towards the ground helps the reader create an accurate visual image of the scene.\n\nOrganic imagery:\n\nOrganic imagery is the most difficult form of imagery to write. It deals with creating a specific feeling or emotion within the reader. Phrases that make the reader feel sad, fearful, nostalgic, elated, even lost are all extremely effective organic imagery. Have you ever read a book that made you question your entire existence? Some authors have such a way with words that one simple sentence can resonate with you for years. \n\nThe optokinetic response (OKR) is a combination of a slow-phase and fast-phase eye movements. It is seen when an individual tracks (pursuit movement) \n\nMy overall depictions are quite obsolete \n    - anachronistic. \nDue to a self prophesied belief that is within the realm of a promulgating hypotheses\u2019 was by a mere thought and tuition while alone that came into a reality worth living.\n\n    - Antediluvian\nThe antediluvian period is the time period chronicled in the Bible between the fall of man and the Genesis flood narrative in biblical cosmology. \nThe term was coined by Thomas Browne. The narrative takes up chapters 1\u20136 of the Book of Genesis.\n\nHas caught up to myself in a sense of Aphantasia. Coming over involuntarily by prognosticating my own beliefs a-loud inward and silencing the outward.\n\nThe human brain is capable of creating more ideas equivalent to that of the atoms of the universe. \n\nThe human brain is made up of more than 10 billion nerve cells and over 50 billion other cells and weighs less than three pounds. \n\nThe human brain is very soft like butter. \n\nThe Human brain stops growing at the age of 18. \n\nBut, in my case of understanding it has not stopped growing. \n\nAs we encounter cycles of days - weeks- years. \nAnd are constantly reminded of the past to prevent a future unbound must come to a fold. \nIs &amp; has taken us away from the very epitomized reasoning of which I am now concluding(without summarizing)by saying this is that \u201cEarth has a way of showing us what our hearts desire.\u201d",

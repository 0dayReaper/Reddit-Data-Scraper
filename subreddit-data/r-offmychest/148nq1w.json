    "postText": "Two months ago, my (22F) long-term relationship ended over a petty argument that toppled a mountain of gathered up frustrations, and I was left confused and heartbroken, wondering how we suddenly went from \u201cnot seeing a life without each other\u201d to complete strangers. And as someone who loved deeply and communicated vigorously in order to make it through, I felt completely blindsided; my efforts were in vain after all as this person (F27) walked away. \n\nI was scared, because during the close-calls to break-up that we\u2019ve had over the course of our relationship, I was shattered and felt like I would not survive without this person. So when I actually had to, I was absolutely dreading what would become of me. \n\nBut what actually happened, blew me right off my feet:\n\nI am actually happier like this. While not always bad because she could be a very sweet person alone and around family; My relationship had made me insecure, constantly having to fight battles just to have my basic needs met by a partner who had excuses for everything, and fought everyone\u2019s battles (sometimes literally) and had little to no interest in her own, walking away from any conversation and escalating it into a fury conflict where I was shoved into a corner by her intimidating, sometimes physical altercations. Acusing me of cheating with my best friend when I very maturely told her she was overreacting during a conflict.\nI was actually scared of my safety when she was mad, and there were some occassions where she put her hands on me.\n\nThe lack of everything that makes a relationship made me suspicious, distrusting and bitter. I always wanted to provide her with anything she needed, but she wanted none of it; it was never my fault though, she said. It would come again, except it never would. There was always something; work, moving house, stress, the rough patch we were going through (that was only amplified by the continued lack of intimacy and communication).\n\nIn hindsight, I don\u2019t blame myself for not trusting her. I wasn\u2019t perfect, nowhere near, but I fought throughout the entire relationship, while I was met with a toxic partner that had even more toxic surroundings:\n\n- An alcoholic, loser friend almost double her age who had no respect for her boundaries and would occassionally make moves on her because he was in love with her and she knew. (But still allowed it because \u2018it didn\u2019t matter because she didn\u2019t feel the same way about him.\u2019 And \u2018that was her friendship mechanic with him\u2019. (Frequent kissing on the cheek too like she was a hooker and he a pimp)\n\n- Stalking done by this friend, ex-FWB\u2019s and past one-night-flings on my social media when we just started dating, while being constantly met with the phrase: \u201cthey meant nothing to me so stop caring.\u201d \n\nOkay so why are they stalking me then??\n\n- Being literally abandoned every time we went out for a night because she felt the overwhelming need to always interfere whenever her best friends fought. (Note, this was often in the pitch black of night around people I was not familiar)\n\n- Again, always having to fight just to feel loved and wanted by her. Being gaslit into thinking that I was needy and controlling for simply wanting her love.\n\n- Calling me controlling and overbearing for simply wanting a text when she\u2019d be home after a night out (because we didn\u2019t always live together)\n\n- Always making me feel like I was the lesser one in our relationship. \n\n- Frequent drinker and addicted smoker that often turned aggressive when mentioned or asked about these addictions.\n\nI wish I never begged for the love that was so difficult for you to give, and simply never swiped right on you. \n\nI am *so* much happier now. I made a ton of new friends, have a much stronger bond with the ones I already had, got my dream internship and a promotion at my work place, feel prettier than I ever have while with her (and apparently other people think so too because I receive a lot of compliments and I\u2019m constantly glowing, because I was always in my ex her shadow like a submissive puppet) and my mental health has improved so drastically that I wondered if I wasn\u2019t simply replaced by aliens with a copy of myself after we split up.\n\nThank you for leaving me. While I will acknowledge that you\u2019ve done good things for me, this was without a doubt the best thing you\u2019ve done for me these past 4 years. \n\nTL;DR - Only after my worst fear of my partner leaving me was realized, did I notice how toxic she and her surroundings truly were. \u201cYou become who you surround yourself with.\u201d",

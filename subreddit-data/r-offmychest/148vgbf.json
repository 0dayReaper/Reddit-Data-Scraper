    "postText": "One of my closest friends of 10 years said something really offensive about my husband, and I can't seem to let it go. I'm angry about what she said. About a month ago, she asked if my husband had gained weight and then commented that it seemed like he lost weight for the wedding and gained it back (we got married a couple of weeks ago). Then, in a different conversation about 2 weeks later, she asked about his weight again. When I mentioned that he used to be skinny when he was younger, she replied, \"No, he wasn't.\" I'm not sure where that is coming from because she never saw what he looked like when he was younger. I don't understand why she keeps picking at his weight.\n\nI'm really angry about the comments she made about my husband. Part of me feels like never talking to her again, but the other part of me remembers that we were best friends for such a long time. Am I wrong for being this mad and unforgiving?\n\nTLDR: My best friend keeps asking about my husband's weight. Is it something forgivable?",

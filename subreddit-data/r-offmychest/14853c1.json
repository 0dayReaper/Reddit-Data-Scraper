I F15 when I was 14 had started talking to this guy I met on Omegle M24 not in the way you may think (at first) we had just talked about where we were from and how we both had similar interests like tennis. But the conversation didn\u2019t end that night because he had asked for my number but I never give my number to strangers so I gave him my snap. As time progressed we talked constantly and when I had met him I was on break so I had a lot of time on my hands I felt like I could go to him any time I had a problem and he could do the same. As time progressed he would make flirtations remarks and I would just say thanks but never feed into it until one night he just became so persistent it was weird he was saying so many things I couldn\u2019t believe he was the same guy I had been talking to but I won\u2019t talk about that in detail since that probably would make anyone uncomfortable. Anyways after that I distanced myself and didn\u2019t talk to him for 2 weeks. But then I became to feel lonely especially when I had dilemmas so I posted on my story that I lost all my contacts so he would swipe up and we would talk again. After that was continually talked everyday but then he started making flirtatious jokes towards me but I had told him I didn\u2019t want him to say any of those things and that it makes me uncomfortable so he apologized and we continued to be friends. Until a few months pass and he continues doing it again and again saying he wants to meet me all this stuff. Until finally I decided to block him. It\u2019s been 3 months since then and I constantly still think about him because other than the fact he was weird at some points he also was a really good friend and made my feelings feel validated he also was really wise and gave me good advice. I just don\u2019t know how I can detach myself from him because all I can think about when I\u2019m alone is him. Obviously I\u2019m not giving you all the details because I mainly just want advice on detachment.",

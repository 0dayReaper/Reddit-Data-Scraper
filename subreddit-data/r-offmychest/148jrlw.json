    "postText": "First thing to say: My english is quite bad so be free to mark my writing.\n\nThere is a lot to say, but i'll try to be short: I didn't had such a bad past at all, but i had to deal with a ton of things that made me overthink and feel anxiety quite often.  \n\\- People often weren't honest with me and i had to guess their true intentions. Most of these situations ended with bad things for me and i quite got the habit of thinking always on the worst situation possible.\n\n\\- I often feel obligated to see my family, though they say that there is not problem if sometimes i just dont want to be with them. But i don't feel good with that because their mood changes when i don't want to. It's like, again, they're not being honest with me and i hate it because i now ask if there is a problem or if it's everything fine.\n\n\\- When i was a kid, i saw my family overreacting a lot and i kinda started doing the same till i noticed that there was no reason for being like that sometimes. So i tend to be extremely cautious with everyone because i don't want anyone to get like that. \n\n\\- Also, i had a stepdad that made my childhood really hard. My self-steem went to 0 because he always insulted me if i made a mistake and he didn't allow me to do a lot of things that i enjoyed to do. A narcisistic asshole. So bye to the freedom of just being wrong sometimes.\n\nThere is a more but that's a part of the \"root\" and i wan't to fix things from deep inside. I'm working a lot on this and i'm getting results... but when i improve, i also see a lot of new things to work on. And it feels like i'll never get the peace of mind that i always wanted.   \n\n\nDespite that, i have a good life. I have a job. I live with my father but maybe in one year i can move out and rent some place to live with the girl i love. I have good skills and i'm constantly improving them so i can get a better life (I'm also working on my english). It's not like i'm dull or whatsoever but i feel that someday this problem will drown me out and make me lose everything that makes me as a being. So i'm starting to get desperate about this because i often feel sad and i tend to screw myself with these insecurities. I want to enjoy my life and the people i love the most, and i want to give myself the life i deserve. \n\nWhy it's so hard to bear with this? It never ends. I really try hard and i feel that i could make some peace with myself. I know that i need a lot of love and care, and i'm constantly looking that from others. But that is a problem, so i'm loving myself more and it really helps... but sometimes it feels that it's never enough for me. It's like a reaaaly big void inside of me.\n\nThat's all for now, it will really help if someone can relate to this.\n\nTl,dr: I'm a overthinker and i'm really tired because it never ends and i'm putting a real effort to improve myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

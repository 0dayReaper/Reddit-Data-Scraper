    "postText": "Is this the right sub for this? Maybe. I think so. I just need to get this \u201coff my chest!\u201d\n\nI fear I might be posted in a negative light on someone\u2019s YouTube channel. I play and make videos about a game that was very popular back in the day but isn\u2019t really anymore. For privacy\u2019s sake, I won\u2019t be naming it here since the community is so small, and I am recognizable in it. Earlier tonight, I played witness to a prank that involved tricking *a lot* of people into thinking they were going to get a good item for very cheap. Pranks are pranks, and they\u2019re meant to get a reaction out of people, which this one did. However, the way that this person orchestrated the prank, and how they acted afterwards was not very nice. That is mainly what I am criticizing. \n\nIn this game, you can sell your items for in-game currency. This person manipulated their shop to be out of reach, so when people went to look for the underpriced valuable item, it was unable to be purchased. To put it in perspective, this specific prank has the same effect as dancing on someone after you\u2019ve killed them in a fps game. It\u2019s seen as very disrespectful. The prankster at first, claimed they weren\u2019t doing anything wrong. Then, that they didn\u2019t know what they were doing was wrong. I knew this to be false because they were a high level, with lots of other valuable items. They kept breaking character throughout the ordeal, so it was obvious that they knew what they were doing. Me and a few others pointed out that they weren\u2019t being very nice, and that their prank was coming off as mean, and not mildly infuriating like pranks are supposed to be. The prankster and a few friends flipped the script, and incited US as the bad guys. Eventually, all but one of the friends and the prankster logged out\u2026 Or so we thought. \n\nOne of the \u201cfriends\u201d turned out to be a sock puppet account operated by the prankster herself. This account was used to interrogate me, specifically. After most of us had moved on, the spare account brought up the situation again, and berated me. They claimed that *I* was a mean person for ruining a prank, and that I was just mad because I wasn\u2019t rich enough to have the bait item (as I was wearing a copy of the item in question\u2026LOL). At first, I didn\u2019t realize who this was. I felt the urge to ask, expecting them to deny it but to mine and everyone else\u2019s shock, they admitted it! \n\nI was able to record some of the altercation and the aftermath, but honestly, it isn\u2019t much. Although, I DO have proof of their admission. I found the original prankster on YouTube, and they\u2019re active. I worry that this was a \u201cprank video\u201d and I could risk tarnishing my reputation; because unfortunately, I have a presence in this small community. Anything I do or say could be misconstrued because the internet is\u2026 well, the internet! And with the power of video editing, the narrative could be altered. I do have a larger presence than this person does right now, but all it takes is one video for my reputation to come crashing down. \n\nI really wasn\u2019t trying to be mean, but rather, educate this person so THEIR reputation doesn\u2019t suffer. I\u2019ve put so much effort into building up my channel and I don\u2019t want it to be for nothing because I was trying to fight the good fight. I guess only time will tell.",

The target I shopped at for years was looted and honestly I'm shocked it wasn't turned in to a structure fire.\n\nTrump shrieked like a baby when Kap took the knee. A peaceful protest was shut down, robbed a man of his career.\n\nMartin Luther King Junior said rioting is the language of the unheard. We deserve these riots. Cops keep choking black men to death and we keep trying to excuse it.",

(I understand the event I'm thinking may be a different state).\n\nCommitting the whole force to beat protestors means no one to address theft or any other issue.\n\nI denounce theft, but I also denounce objective failure of that state and the mismanagement of resources which is leading to measurable losses of life and revenue.",

However, after WW2, they were in incredible debt and couldn't pay their own soldiers to stay in India. So Gandhi and his method worked bc the state was already hemorrhaging capital and the best solution for them was to cut and run.\n\n3: Also Gandhi was a high ranking member of society with access to many amenities that others didn't. He was privileged. Black people in America do not have that kind of privilege.",

    "postText": "My dog, Macy, is a 6 year old Australian Shepherd.  She has always had a high prey drive and has been known for killing things such as raccoons, groundhogs, opossums, etc.  I\u2019ve never encouraged the hunting but I\u2019ve never punished her, as the raccoons and groundhogs have damaged property and killed our chickens before.  But recently, she killed one of our outdoor cats.  Now, she\u2019s known this cat her whole life and has always been friendly towards her.  But yesterday, I found the cat shaken and with two puncture wounds in her neck, but I didn\u2019t see her actually kill her.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do.  I don\u2019t know why she would\u2019ve suddenly attacked a cat she\u2019s known and liked her entire life.  And I\u2019m worried she might do it again.  I\u2019ve ordered a muzzle for her to wear outdoors but I can\u2019t stop stressing over the situation.  I live with my parents and if she does this again, I\u2019ll either have to put her down or move to an area where I can keep her secluded (I\u2019d move out before ever considering putting her down).  I just don\u2019t know why she would\u2019ve done this or if she\u2019ll do it again.",

She never goes off the property and spends most of her time out in the barn.  Our other dogs are the same but she\u2019s the only one that hunts.",

She\u2019s the only one we\u2019re having an issue with.  And you\u2019re right, I\u2019m not positive it was her, but I suppose, she also needs to stop killing other animals too.  I\u2019ve always been afraid to discipline her for killing animals since I don\u2019t want her to associate an animal with negative emotions and kill them for that reason.  So a leash or muzzle is probably my best bet with her.",

Or if there really is some other wildlife that can attack her also, it would not be fair to her not to get defend herself with the muzzle. That's being said I'd think fairest thing to do is the leash. At least you could try! \nYeah you can't discipline her after she had killed some animal, because she wouldn't understand it afterwards, that's why the leash is so important. Also you could spend time with her outside. Maybe she is bored and hunting is the best thing to do. If she starts to hunt, you pick up the long lead and call her to you. If she doesn't come just pull her to you. Never call her more than two times or she knows she can ignore u! Then play with her with a flirt pole for example (I think she would like that because she likes to hunt), or do something she likes. After a while she starts to associate this to you and having fun. It can take a little time so don't give up after two weeks. I hope it helps \u2764\ufe0f",

They do it because that\u2019s what they\u2019re bred to do, it\u2019s fun, and you\u2019ve done nothing to stop her. Dogs don\u2019t understand life and death. You will need to either get rid of other pets, keep her muzzled, move to a more urban area or euthanasia her. I\u2019d also be concerned about killing any chickens if they\u2019re allowed to roam.",

Like I said, I\u2019ve already bought a muzzle and will begin putting it on her whenever she goes outside.  Hopefully, in the future she\u2019ll calm down a bit or maybe learn not to attack.\n\n As for the chickens, they\u2019re already in an enclosed area because the cats and dogs would both probably attack them.

    "postText": "Please excuse my writing, English is not my first language so bear with me.\n\nMy parents have been separated for 22 years because \"my Dad\" has been cheating with multiple women in the past but they have never been officially separated according to the law(from where they got married). We came from a country that doesnt have divorce. One day, my Mom decided after 10 years of marriage, decided it's enough so she left with her kids. Since my Mom left \"my Dad\" we have never seen a trace of him ever. No phone calls, no visits, No support whatsoever. He never even came to chase us after what happened. He lived like a single man since then, living his life, while his kids suffer from poverty, atleast that's what his relatives say to my Mom. So my siblings and I moved on in our lives from what happened. My Mom found an opportunity to work abroad and eventually brought us with her and lived here.\n\nThat mistake that he did left us scars to the point that all of us siblings were reluctant to get married at one point in the past. But I got married anyways. About a few years ago, I came back to the country where I was born, got married and had a daughter, eventually had to bring them to the country where I now live. I decided to reach out to \"him\". Imagine, for 2 decades he didn't even attempt to communicate with any of us. I was even the ones who made an effort to see him. I met him anyways. It was a good meeting. He held his grand daughter and he was happy. I told him I forgave him and we had moved on. I saw him had a bit of a relief from what I said to him. Bid him farewell afterwards.\n\nRecently, I spoke to my mom(She didn't even know I met with her ex husband). She has always wanted to file for annulment so her marriage with this man will be nulled and voided but she couldn't afford the amount of money to get it done. It's darn expensive. My mom never got married again. Never even had any relationship after their separation. She truly was dedicated to her kids. She is a great parent. Raised us with all compassion and hardwork although not a perfect parent but she was all we can wish for. She ended up filing for a divorce having to pay all the legal fees and stuff. Idk how divorce works with 2 people living from different countries but all I know was that her \"ex-husband\" got sent out a letter to sign so the process can be completed. He didn't pay a single cent to get this process done. Eventually my mom wants to annull the marriage for her peace of mind.\n\nWhen \"my Dad\" found out about this, he took advantage of the situation and married this woman he's in a relationship with that he also had a child with. He asked for the document of divorce from the city where my mom filed in the country where she now lives secretly. This broke my Mom not because he married another woman but because after all these years, no financial support, hasn't showed up for two decades, not even emotional support to any of his kids took advantage of the fact that he is now a free man and was able to get married using my Mom's money and effors. I have already moved on from the situation and I forgave him but after everything he did to my mom since 22 years ago and now this?\n\nFrom what I was told he's not a single man YET since divorce doesn't count from where he lives, they still need the annulment to void their marriage so he can finally get married again. But he got married anyways without consideration to the legalities of the situation.\n\nAlthough Im happy he can move on, I hated the fact he took advantage of all my Mom's efforts to cater his selfishness. (Atleast maybe, pay for the annulment?). I just wanna get this off my chest",

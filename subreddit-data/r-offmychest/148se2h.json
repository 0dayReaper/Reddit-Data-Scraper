It's not a matter of what her body is supposed to do. Some women can't get pregnant and there's nothing wrong with them. I know you don't mean it like this but I don't like that phrasing. I've heard a lot of people use it and IMO, it implies that they're not a real woman until they've given birth.",

First steps, first day of school, first time reading, by themselves, first bff, first love, first dance , date, car. And, you will be right there, for those memories!!\n\n Enjoy this time, with your wife. Hold her hair, through the morning sickness. Deal with her cravings. Commiserate, when she feels like crap. Rub her feet.   Help her through this time, because, that's a wee slice of you, making her hormones rage.  When the time comes, make sure she's holding onto your hand, high up, or, you could have broken fingers! \n\n Congratulations, and welcome to the rollercoaster ride of your lives!",

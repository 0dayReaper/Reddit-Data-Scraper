    "postText": "I have had my cat since 2011 when he was 6 months old.  He was supposed to be a \"family cat\" but it was obvious from the beginning that he was mine.  He came from animal control and is the perfect cat for me.  He is confident, loves exploring new places, goes on walks, doesn't mind car rides.  I can walk with him down the main hallway in my apartment complex and he never gets too far away.  If I bend down to call for him he comes running right to me.  He was with me through horrible panic attacks in college and an abusive relationship after.  He's just... an amazing cat. \n\nHe has had liver issues since at least 2019.  That's when he was diagnosed but it could have been going on for longer since he never had symptoms.  The life expectency was 5 years.  He's getting pretty close to that. He still doesn't have many symptoms. He's just now starting to lose weight.  He had everything checked recently. Liver, thyroid, kidneys, urine, heart, everything and it was all normal.  Except the liver, but it's normal for him at this point.  I'm just terrified of the day he starts to go downhill.  Every little change makes me nervous.  He slept a lot today....cus he's dying or just tired?? He hasn't been eating as much...cus he's dying or just getting old??? He meowed a lot today...cus he's in pain or just wants to be played with??  I never know.  And I'm scared of the day that it IS because he's dying.  It's going to happen eventually.  \n\nI understand that preemptively freaking out does no good.  That I need to focus on giving him the best life possible and I hope I am.  But it's still going to happen and it's going to be the worst.",

And even a year later I cried some too. It\u2019s difficult but just know he\u2019ll be in less pain after it happens. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t happen soon but prepare yourself for the inevitable\ud83d\udc99",

    "postText": "I had the thought that I should put shorts on so they wouldn't find me dead with just my underwear on, it felt like just an ideation but then I actually put them on without even really thinking about it. Then I thought I should clean my room but decided nah it's gonna go in the trash anyway.  I'm sitting on the floor next to my clothes and I was looking at them thinking about which one would be best to go around my neck, not really thinking I would actually do it.  But I started crying and grabbed the cardigan, I just held it. I didn't expect to actually wrap it around my neck, I didn't think I would get to that point.  I wrapped it around and held the two sides in my hands and pulled only tight enough that I could still talk in a raspy voice, and it didn't hurt.  I thought it didn't matter, no one believes in me anyway, if they don't think I'll amount to anything then that's how it will be.  I just sat for a while like that crying.  I said my dog's name and he came down off the bed to me all sleepy and wiggling his little stub tail.  I let go of the cardigan but I don't feel any better. I have a knot of pain on my heart that I can't get rid of, I hurt so bad.  I made a promise to my sister that I wouldn't do it, but I really want to. I can't tell her because she has schizophrenia and I don't want to stress her out, plus she's sleeping right now.  Writing out my feelings helps a little, because I'll never actually tell a single soul I know how close I came to doing it.  I'm going to try to distract myself by putting my pokemon card info into an Excel spreadsheet and listening to crime shows so Im listening to people who's problems are much bigger than my own.",

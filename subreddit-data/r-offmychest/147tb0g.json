    "postText": "I\u2019m not suicidal, and probably have some form of cyclothymic mood disorder. But I often find myself just feeling exhausted at the thought of even getting up and putting together the right steps in order to work. It\u2019s not just laziness, it\u2019s laziness in addition to overwhelming fear and exhaustion and the thought of the journey I had. I am a \u201clate bloomer\u201c in life as it is, but being in graduate school amongst people three or four years younger than me at the stage I am at, makes me feel like there\u2019s no point to the end of this journey. \n\nOn top of that, I don\u2019t have anything in my life that I can \u201cescape to\u201c that I know I can be proud of or happy and regardless of what happens in other aspects of my life. I\u2019m not a particularly fit looking person, I don\u2019t have other worldly talents, and in the grand scheme, on paper I\u2019m a successful individual, but my life can be summed up as \u201cprofoundly mediocre\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t want to end it. I really don\u2019t. I want someone to come in with an idea of the \u201cbest\u201d future and unleash my full potential. Every aspect of my life that I hit below the benchmark I want to come I know that I can do better. But the constant falling down and getting back up is exhausting. And I wish somebody could either unlock part of my mind that finally gives me the wisdom I need to play catch-up successfully, or set my bones right in a way where whatever I feel I am \u201clagging\u201c in, will rapidly start to disappear. \n\nObviously, this sounds like I want to \u201cquick fix\u201c to all of my problems and of course, who wouldn\u2019t? But on a deeper level, I\u2019m tired of feeling every aspect of my life is a constant work in progress. I just want to feel like \u201cI\u2019m good\u201d in at least 1 aspect of my life.",

Like make the same two things for lunch everyday. Have the same meal every Mondays. Same takeout every Tuesday. Get rid of extra clothes you don\u2019t wear so you have a \u201ccapsule\u201d closet where you can grab any two things and have a decent outfit ready to go. \n\nAlso, get an animal? Escape in the fuzziness and love! \nOr volunteer somewhere with extra time. An animal rescue or park cleanup.",

            "comment": "I experience this feeling a lot too. Like I can picture my qualities, skills and personality traits as a newborn baby with tons of potential, and I'm the shit parent that's constantly screwing it up; and if I could only leave the baby at a fire station or on the doorstep of someone more qualified, they could actually raise it into someone really cool and impressive. \n\nI'm also about to go back to a graduate school for a second master's degree and potentially heading into academia after that. There definitely will be people younger than me in the course and I'm dreading the feeling of lagging behind in life, as you put it - it doesn't help that I used to be perceived as a very career-oriented \"gifted\" kid. \n\nWhat I'm trying to keep in mind is that I'll have experience that younger classmates don't, not only in work but in general life skills. Maybe try to remind yourself of that more often? It's not really the same as feeling like \"you're good\", more like \"I am well equipped (and even better equipped than some people) at dealing with some stuff. I am a work in progress, but I have the tools I need to keep working towards that progress, even if it takes time and I get discouraged sometimes.\"\n\nIt's also worth remembering that you're not obligated to 100% flourish in every facet of your life. No one does. Maybe there are skills you have that could be honed and sharpened, but they don't have to be; just because you're kinda good at something doesn't mean you have to make yourself become excellent at it. You can start exercising more without becoming an athlete or even a fit person. Not all potential has to be unleashed or unlocked in a grand way, it can just... Be there.",

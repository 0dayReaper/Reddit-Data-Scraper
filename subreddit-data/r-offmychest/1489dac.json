    "postText": "so yesterday i was out with my boyfriend of nearly 4 months all day and he kept getting messages from this girl on snapchat and i know for a fact he doesn\u2019t talk to many people on there because we have openly used our phones in front of one another etc. but today he\u2019d only message her or answer her text if i wasn\u2019t looking which i found super odd but a month prior to this i was at my boyfriends friends house sat with him on the sofa and saw a message from the same girl and she had added a smiley face at the end of the message. a week later i asked him who the girl was and he told me it was just an old friend he then broke up with me because \u2018i\u2019ll just keep bringing up issues and it will be a cycle\u2019 but anyway we got back together\n\nanyway i can\u2019t really ask who she is because he\u2019s already said she\u2019s a very old friend but i just don\u2019t believe him because i can\u2019t find her on any social media or any of his friends social media it\u2019s super odd and i\u2019m not sure what to do",

You don't have to put up with rhis. It's just 4 mos. and he's already sneaking behind your back. Ask him for his phone. If it's an old friend he should have no problem proving it. Do not go back to him. He's gonna play you like a yo-yo until you say stop.",

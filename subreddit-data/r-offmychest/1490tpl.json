    "postText": "Most days I am able to accept my body for what it has become. It has supported me all these years and I\u2019m grateful I made it this far. \n\nNow when it comes to sex and dating, these are the moments that hurt most. I have a pretty face, that I\u2019m sure of. I have just gained some weight back over this past year and it\u2019s making me feel shitty (5\u20193 about 160lbs). Exercising doesn\u2019t come easy for me due to my mental health and an old injury that happened when I was a teenager. \n\nI can\u2019t even have a successful one night stand. That\u2019s what triggered me to write this. I dated someone recently who was so good to me and thought I was so beautiful, that felt nice. Our morals and values just didn\u2019t align and I can\u2019t settle just to feel good anymore. \n\nBack to the one night stand. My pictures on the apps are recent, I even have one in my bathing suit so it\u2019s clear I\u2019m not skinny. I\u2019m not even fat, just some extra weight. I matched with this good looking guy and we snapped all day so it was clear he knew what I looked like and I even confirmed he was aware so there was no surprise. At this point I haven\u2019t had sex in about 9 months, I didn\u2019t sleep with the guy I dated recently, and I just wanted a good fuck. \n\nSo I met him outside of my building and right away he lied about his height, we were eye level with my shoes on and he was a bad kisser, bit my lip so hard I can still feel it. I figured whatever he\u2019s already here, let\u2019s just get to it. I walk in front of him to my apartment and we get to the door and he stops and says \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t do this\u201d and leaves. Which was a relief to be honest and at the same time hurt a little. \n\nI did do a cleansing before he came over and asked to be protected if it wasn\u2019t going to be good for me so I am taking it as that. Yet, another part of me believes it\u2019s the way I look. \n\nBeing a human is tough some days. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.",

I'm also a chunky person myself and I try to make jokes about it, but most of the time its just constant comments about my weight, I hope you have a good day and I congratulate you for trying to stay happy \u2764",

    "postText": "\nFor context I started talking to this girl our senior year of high school, which just ended. We met in a class we both had, started texting, then progressed to making out at prom and going on multiple dates in a couple month span. Things were going great and we had both expressed that we had a connection with each other and would text and call everyday and were both able to open up about trauma and really deep things to each other. \n\nIn the past week everything just went to shit for her I guess, we went from seeing each other on a date early in the week that she invited me on and would start making out with me again during, to again talking to and taking pictures together at our graduation the very next day, to hardly talking the next few days and then her dropping a bomb on me that she doesn\u2019t really have feelings for me anymore and it\u2019s nothing to do with me I\u2019m a great guy she just doesn\u2019t feel it with me. I can respect that, it\u2019s not my first relationship and not the first time I\u2019ve been dumped but I just have a problem with being so nonchalantly cut out of her life now after doing nothing wrong and I just can\u2019t understand what is going on in her head to make her feel like this is what she has to do right now.\n\nI\u2019m just kind of bummed and feel played out right now. Even if we didn\u2019t have to be together I genuinely enjoyed being her friend and felt like she pushed forward the relationship in the first place to then shut me down when I developed the feelings I thought she had too. I just wish we could still be friends at least and not just strangers now.",

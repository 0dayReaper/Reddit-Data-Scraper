(BTw I'm 16F) \n\nTo put it simply, my friend (17M) was doubting himself if he was going to have a chance of making it to an art based program at my school (he is also in that same school right now). Because of the amount of things that he needs to do. I kept telling him that he will make it but his doubts got the best of him. When he was on the verge of tears (and I can tell), I asked if he was okay, he brushed it off and said \"Real men don't cry\".\n\nI got pissed very easily and I told him in a serious tone \"Don't you ever say that again or else I'm slapping you in the face.\" \nHe eventually got the courage to cry infront of me and I didn't give 2 shits if he did, I didn't care for any tears on my clothing, HECK it was wet already from the rain!!!, I just wanted him to be okay, and to not have his emotions be bottled up because of my own experience. \n\nHe hugged me tight and I hugged him back. The side of me was sore abit but I didn't care, I was taking care of my friend. But after he felt better and I said (for the second or third time) to not say \"real men don't cry\" again. \n\nFor anyone (and I mean anyone) experiencing like bottling it in is the best option (Men, this applies to you), it's not healthy at all, seriously.",

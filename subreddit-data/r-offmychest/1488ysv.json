    "postText": "I lost my ferret about 2 months ago after caring for her for 4-5 years. She was like my child, friend, and companion. When i was upset she would like away my tears, she loved cuddles in my lap. She died unexpectedly, no warning. Immediately after her death i was in shock, then eventually had the expected breakdown. Since then ive been okay, almost forgetting anything happend. But as im typing this im calming down from another breakdown, one prompted by my desire to hold her because ive been having a hard time in just life. Her ashes and urn dont comfort me, feels like a mockery, like shes reduced to this box, to a picture. I cant even lie to myself and pretend its her, they arnt her, and i want her. Am I weird for this, or have others felt a similar way?",

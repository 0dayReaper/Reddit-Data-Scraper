    "postText": "So I (f18) have had the biggest crush on a guy (m18) for about a year now. For context, we both know of each other, but have probably said a total of 5 words to each other. Recently, I worked up the courage to add him by search on Snapchat, but it\u2019s been about a week and he has not accepted or rejected it. He doesn\u2019t have any social media besides that one and likely isn\u2019t active on it, so there\u2019s really nothing I can do to make a move. It is currently summer break, so unless we run into each other by chance, we won\u2019t see each other. We also don\u2019t really have any mutual friends, so I have no idea what to do.",

And you\u2019ll be even smarter, healthier, and more confident to say hello to his face. But if you don\u2019t run into each other, you\u2019re just all of those things for the the boy that deserves you. :)",

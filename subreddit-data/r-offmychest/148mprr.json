    "postText": "I never felt like studying so I said I\u2019d study for my finals 2 weeks beforehand. And things werw going pretty great, I have a good memory. A week ago I got these white bumps on my right tonsil that wouldn\u2019t budge, but I said whatever as it didn\u2019t hurt at all. Then, one morning I woke up with an apple sized tonsil.\nI didn\u2019t care as it still didn\u2019t hurt so I gargled some salt water and went to study. 10h later I passed out from what I think was a drop in my iron levels, 30min later my fever spiked, throat is burning. One visit later to the doc, I have strep and am currently on antibiotics! Probably will eat up all my time to study! Huge regret, guess I got my karma.",

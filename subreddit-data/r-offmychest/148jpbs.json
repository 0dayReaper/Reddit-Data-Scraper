    "postText": "about 2 months ago, my best friend and her now-ex were together for about 9 months. she fell out of love, cheated on him while still together and broke up with him shortly after his birthday. me and my boyfriend broke up after one year in march (he broke up with me and it really hit me), so she said we should have a hot girl summer and feel free before her studies start. i agreed and were exited. \nfast forward to about one month ago, we met a guy and one of his closes friends. long story short, her and the guy started dating about a week ago. i feel really bad hanging out with them lately because everyone makes fun of me (and don\u2019t get me wrong, i like a good joke about myself, but they really cross the line now) and i feel so lonely. i really want a new relationship again and love and all that she has. just for fun, my friend told me to add her ex on snapchat. we started meeting again (first time alone) and really matched. we can talk for hours on end and spend all of our free time together (and we messed up each other\u2019s sleep schedule haha). he actually seems to like me back and we already got closer. we\u2019re almost acting like a couple and he really makes me happy like no one did for a long time. \nthe problem is: everyone starts hating on me because of that. they say i can\u2019t date him or anything, because he\u2019s the ex of my \u201cbest friend\u201d. she told me i\u2019m just horny and think about myself all the time but i think this is not true. first of all: i didn\u2019t have the deed with someone RIGHT NEXT TO HER, i don\u2019t make fun of her all the time, i don\u2019t talk (normally) behind her back and i\u2019d respect it if she\u2019d tell me to not show of my new love because it makes her feel un likable. i\u2019m just so sick of this shit because everyone treats me badly and i don\u2019t think i deserve that. i finally start to feel happy again and now the shitstorm begins",

It's really a shitty position to be in and it sucks, but at the same time, there is literally billions of people in the world and you chose someone who your friends really don't like. They made it pretty clear to you and most people would also cut you off.  Just do whatever you feel is right. Either get new friends or don't hang around their exes.",

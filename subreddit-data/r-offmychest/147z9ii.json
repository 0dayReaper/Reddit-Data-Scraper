    "postText": "Apologies for the morbidity of this post but wow, I held a loaded gun to my head and it sure was peaceful. I think I was disassociating when I did it. I was looking into a mirror and saw my existence slowly fade. I sat with it a few minutes after and pondered my desirability to escape into the ever-lasting abyss of death. I cried after realizing how comfortable with my own death I was. I know it\u2019s abnormal but no one in my life takes me serious. I want to experience the entirety of my brief chance at life on Earth, but it feels as though its been taken away from me. I\u2019m gonna kill myself someday and the people that will be sad are the ones that could have helped, unfortunately. But that\u2019s the irony of the world we live in.",

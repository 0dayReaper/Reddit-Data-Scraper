All the time.\n\nI try to put on a front that I\u2019m getting better and I think I\u2019ve managed to fool the people around me. Truth is I don\u2019t think I ever will get better. I think I missed my chance to change things, I\u2019m too old now.\n\nAnd now people except me to turn things around since I\u2019ve fooled them I\u2019m doing better. Thing is I think it would kill me but I can\u2019t tell them that. All I can do is run with the change and see how long I last.\n\nI don\u2019t want to let people down but I\u2019m not strong enough not to.",

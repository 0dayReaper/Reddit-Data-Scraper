    "postText": "I dont live in my native country and i feel very isolated from everyone. People only care about you if they want something from you and they dont actually want to be your friend. I feel used. \nIn my last post on only real true friend has rejected me and i think its because they were only trying to use me and i became aware. I feel disgusting. \n\nI started feeling vety suicidal and sat on the cliffs by the ocean and cried from hours. dont belong. I started walking back home and ran into one of my friends. The last time i talked to them the told me that nobody wanted to be around me or cared about me. They only spend yime with me when they are bored and want entertainmenti felt devistated.\nI told them how much it hurt but they just told me to forget it and never said anything after. \n\nWhen i ran into her, i told her how hurt i was and she said she didnt mean it. Vut when i started crying she rolled her head and scoffed. She said i was being dramatic and i shouldnt bother people. \nI feel so guilty for being a problem like everyone else has problems too. Im expected to care for everyone and i want everyone to be happy but nobody cares about me. If i say im upset, i get cut off. \n\nI just feel as if im about to break and i have no energy. \nIm taking a sick day off work tomorrow. I just cant function at all",

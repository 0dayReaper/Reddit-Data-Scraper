    "postText": "I (25M) am considering the possibility of tracking down and hopefully meeting my birth mother. I\u2019m currently about 6 months away from graduating university and I have received a fairly decent job offer that I am most likely going to capitalize on. As a result, I will most likely hold off actively pursuing the goal of meeting her until I\u2019m a bit more oriented with life (settled into my occupation, move out of grandparents\u2019 house, etc.).\n\nFor context my birth parents had two children (myself/older brother), however due to their living/financial conditions they were unable to raise two children. This resulted in their decision to have my grandparents raise me. I had/am continuing to have an excellent relationship/life with my grandparents, but I\u2019ve always considered the possibility of meeting my actual parents. I haven\u2019t brought this up with my grandparents due to the likelihood of it being a sore subject. Based on some discussions I\u2019ve overheard throughout the years I don\u2019t think they have the best relationship with her.\n\nI have a number of concerns about whether or not I should attempt to reach out to my mother that may seem insignificant to most, but they are proving to be large stumbling blocks for me. About 2 years ago my mother reached out to me over LinkedIn but I panicked and deleted my account. I think that there is a significant chance that she may have interpreted my actions as a form of resentment towards her which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I also do not want to intrude upon her, or my brother\u2019s lives. The last time she saw me was when I was 9 months old so I feel like reaching out all of the sudden may be interpreted as a form of intrusion since there hasn\u2019t been any form of communication between us since I started living with my grandparents.\n\nThe final reason that I am hesitant to reach out to her would be because I\u2019m afraid of disappointing her. I realize this could be viewed as being selfish on my part as well as unfounded since graduating university/having a decent occupation lined up are things worthy of being proud of. Nonetheless I feel that it\u2019s not good enough. After essentially 26 (turning 26 this year) years I would like to present myself in a manner that would make her proud. I don\u2019t think I can currently do that.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just here to ask if anyone thinks that I should reach out or simply leave things as they currently are?\n\nI appreciate anyone who took the time to read this. Thank you for your time.",

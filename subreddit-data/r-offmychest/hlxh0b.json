He gets back from his vacation to find that Jesus is back in Heaven, slacking off, getting high and playing guitar with the likes of Jimi, and that Earth is worse than ever. Furious and disappointed he sends Jesus back to get the job done right this time.\n\nExcept, it's now the mid-2000s when Jesus reaches his 30s and the only way he figures he can reach the masses is by getting on the world's biggest TV show; American Idol. \n\nIt's a funny book, but it satirises not just Christianity, but all religion too, on top of loads of critiques on modern society. It does a brilliant job of portraying Jesus as this  incredibly charming rebellious free spirit, as the Bible does, standing up for the downtrodden etc and likewise shows just how much that irks the hardcore, evangelical Christians and a lot of the people in charge.",

Take it from Francis Chan (pastor and author of the Christian bestseller Crazy Love):\n\nHe was leading a typical Western, evangelical church, and that, according to Chan, was exactly the problem. Everything centred around \u201ca speaking gift and a sermon\u201d, he says. In other words, people were flocking to preacher-man Chan, rather than seeking an encounter with God. \u201cOne of the problems at our church is when I hear the words \u2018Francis Chan\u2019 more than I hear the words \u2018Holy Spirit\u2019.\u201d\n\nUncomfortable with his increasing level of fame, and unsettled by a church culture at Cornerstone that he was struggling to change, Chan moved his family to the other side of the world. As he spent time in Asia, among persecuted Christians, the leader caught a fresh vision of what church should be like. He started a new church-planting network called We Are Church (wearechurch.com). Each church in the network is made up of ten to 20 people. \n\nChan says the smaller size means Christians are able to \u201ctruly know each other and carry each other\u2019s burdens\u201d. Each church meets in a person\u2019s home, so there\u2019s no need to fundraise in order to purchase large buildings, and the church leaders are all volunteers, so they don\u2019t need to take a salary. \n\nAll the money that is given to each church is spent on the poor and on mission and the wider church family is \u201cconstantly evaluating\u201d whether it\u2019s time to \u201cmultiply\u201d (ie start another congregation), so every pastor is charged with training another leader to follow in their footsteps.\n\n(excerpted from https://www.premierchristianity.com/Past-Issues/2019/February-2019/Francis-Chan-Why-I-quit-my-megachurch-and-started-again)",

He kind of just does whatever the fuck he wants, and thinks that he\u2019s doing the right things because he\u2019s kind at heart.

Renaissance painters would\u2019ve loved to capture his pure angst. I just honestly believe that he\u2019s never really shown his \u2018true\u2019 self. I don\u2019t think anyone can believe that the Kanye we see online is the real Kanye. I think he\u2019s just drowning in his own image, in the end does he even know who he is?\n\nEdit to add that I don\u2019t think having mental illness makes you a musical genius. I personally think Kanye has made some good, innovative music. He happens to suffer from mental illness issues. I agree that he should be taking better care of himself and is accountable for all his actions. Not a big Kanye fan lol, wasn\u2019t trying to defend him in the slightest.",

For two decades I thought that I was the only victim of my mental illness. Wasn't I the one cutting myself, starving myself, trying to hang myself, getting put in a locked psych ward, praying for the courage to just fucking kill myself already? Sure, I went through all of that. \n\nBut then I got sober, and I found out I'd been misdiagnosed for years. (Although I much prefer my old diagnosis, but oh well.) I met and married a guy with a chronic bowel disease, who has to be rushed to the ER once or twice a year in such severe pain that I have to bring him inside in a wheelchair. I fucking HATE watching him go through that. I feel so helpless - all I want to do is make him feel better and I can't. I would rather take on the pain myself than watch him suffer. I think that's a little taste of what my friends and family felt watching me do and go through all the shit that I did, except that I also scared the living shit out of them bc they were dreading the day that someone found me dead. I think I might have gotten off lighter in the suffering department, really. \n\nMaybe Kanye just hasn't had that insight yet. He's super fucking successful and famous - maybe because he gets adored so much he hasn't noticed there are downsides to his symptoms for people close to him. It's got to be a much, much more complicated experience for someone that wealthy and talented than it was for me. And I get why ppl don't want to take their meds. They make you feel like a zombie, or empty, or they make you fat and fuck with your memory and your sex life. He has a point there, too. \n\nSo yes, I wish he would come out and advocate for other mentally ill people and lead by example. But I also get why he would want to stay in denial. Being manic is like being high - you feel good ALL the time, and you think everything you do and think is brilliant and important. I can't really judge him. I just believe that people don't usually change without being motivated by some kind of pain or loss, and I guess he's just not there yet.",

Remember \u201cKanye 2020\u201d? Trump is acting increasingly oblivious to the actual state of the culture, health, and economy of the country. He is calling in the big guns. Next stop, the Hail Mary. That will be coming in September. I don\u2019t know how to convince others, but a vote for Kanye is a vote for Trump.",

It's one thing to genuinely want to run because you think you're the best candidate. \n\nIt's another to give his fan base the idea and then split the vote. Even if he doesn't actually run there are plenty of his followers who will write his name in. (Remember Harambe in 2016? Yeah hundreds of thousands of people wrote him in on their ballets.)

Gary Johnson had a bigger impact against the republicans if we\u2019re using this logic).  Kanye could easily draw millions of disillusioned youths Biden expects the vote from despite not reaching out to them and this would swing it.",

He is setting a bad example for everyone who relies on medications to manage their mental health conditions and should not be stopping their medications without the guidance of a medical professional.",

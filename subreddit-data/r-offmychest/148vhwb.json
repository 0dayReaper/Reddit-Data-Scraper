    "postText": "So yeah every time I go there with friends that are with girls, guys end up looking at me and touching me for no reason lol. I talk to them for a few minutes with no intention of doing something not even giving them hits if im gay (im not) they just flirt and I just make a few simple compliments to them. then after exchanging few words I tell them to give me some of their drink. They reach the glass to my lips and I proceed with a \u2018buy me a drink\u2019 while touching the shoulder or some shit and it works hahah. \n\nLast week a guy bought me three drinks and invited me to his apartment at downtown. I went and hangout for like 30 minutes and drinking wine. He was touchy and looking straight to my fucking eyes. We leaved and he gave me chocolates, chips, drinks and told me to visito him often Hahhaha. my friend was with me the whole time and I never acted gay because I\u2019m not. \n\nI do this because sometimes they are thirsty thirsty with me and I feel uncomfortable. So I might as well take advantage. Now I kinda know what being a girl with a pretty privilege feels like hahahh. It\u2019s nice tho to get free stuff.",

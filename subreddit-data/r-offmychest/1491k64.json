    "postText": "i met robin (fake name) my junior year of high school and we almost immediately clicked. we both had back-to-back art classes together first thing in the morning and that\u2019s how we bonded and became friends. we\u2019d talk for the entirety of those two hours and eventually outside of school through text and instagram as well. she was genuinely one of the most beautiful people i had ever met, inside and out. \n\nwe quickly formed a super strong bond and i confided in her more than i did in friends i had known for my whole life. we both struggled with self harm among other mental health issues and though neither of us were actively recovering, it was just nice to know that someone else coped in the same shitty ways. \n\ni really don\u2019t know how else to describe how close we were. she told me about her relationship issues, her family issues, how she struggled with alcohol and drug use and i told her about my struggles with many of the same things. we would be on the phone for hours comforting each other, literally just listening to each other\u2019s rants and crying and venting.\n\ni never got to hang out with her outside of school except for a few brief times because her dad and her grandma who looked after her were so incredibly strict. but the few times we did see each other it was amazing. i\u2019ve never met someone who understood me as much as she did.\n\nthen she was sexually assaulted. i don\u2019t want to go into detail but it really messed her up. it was by a guy she was friends with, right after she got broken up with and i knew she was in a really bad headspace. i was scared when she told me about it and honestly stupid and i filed an anonymous police report. next thing that happened is she called me crying while i was at my grandma\u2019s house. i literally ran upstairs to a private room and listened as she told me how the police had showed up at her house, how her grandma now knew what had happened, etc. i was about to say how sorry i was but before i could she said she knew it was me who had made the report. i expected her to cuss me out, hang up, block me, and never talk to me again but she didn\u2019t. she thanked me. and said that it needed to happen. i was shocked but so relieved.\n\nafter that she told me that her grandma was going to take away her phone soon and that she didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d be able to keep texting for. i said it was okay and we didn\u2019t speak for a few hours.\n\nduring that time she ended up getting into arguments with her ex boyfriend and the guy who had assaulted her on instagram. she had just been trying to confide in her ex as they were still very close, but he stupidly took it upon himself to message her assaulter and ended up implying that he didn\u2019t believe her story.\n\nthe whole time she was sending me screenshots of their conversations and i was frantically trying to calm her down. i asked to call or facetime but she refused. i even messaged her ex and begged him to stop talking to her, telling him he was only making things worse. eventually she stopped texting me but i wasn\u2019t immediately worried as she was clearly overwhelmed and maybe just needed a break. \n\na few more hours passed and i still couldn\u2019t contact her so i messaged her ex again, asking if he had heard from her. he told me that she had messaged him \u201ci love you\u201d and then blocked him. i immediately went into the most blind panic i\u2019ve ever experienced in my life. i was texting her over and over to no response, calling, literally anything i could think of. after that not working i explained the situation to my mom and how i was genuinely worried she could have hurt herself. my mom, bless her, drove me to robin\u2019s house in the middle of the night so i could check on her. \n\ni vividly remember knocking on her door and her younger cousin answering. i asked him if robin was home/okay and he hesitantly told me that her grandma had to take her to the hospital and that she had tried to kill herself. i was so shocked that i just thanked him for telling me, got back in the car and left. i told my mom and dad what he had said and i cried most of the night. i barely slept. in the morning my mom called the local hospital and though they couldn\u2019t tell us much we found out she was a patient there.\n\nafter that i didn\u2019t hear from her for months. finally, out of the blue, she emailed me through our school emails and told me everything; how she\u2019d been in a mental hospital for several weeks, on new medication, seeing several therapists, etc. i was so relieved to hear from her but our communication was very limited as her grandma had still not allowed her to use her phone again. we emailed back and forth and called a few times on google meet, and eventually on instagram once school started and she was able to borrow her friend\u2019s phone to message me. she had also been transferred to a new school so i virtually never saw her.\n\nits been like this for about a year. school just ended for the summer and she hasn\u2019t messaged me back on instagram in weeks. im a senior so i\u2019ve graduated while she\u2019s still a year behind me. i can\u2019t describe how broken up i still feel about this. i have nightmares about her dying and dreams about us finally meeting in person again. i know she\u2019s not just ghosting me; every time we were able to talk she was insistent that i was her best friend, that i meant the world to her, that she missed me, etc. i see people on the street that look like her and go into a panic. its so painful living everyday with these memories and not even being able to get closure in person. i constantly question if she\u2019s actually still alive because i have no proof. \n\nwhen she was in the hospital, i crocheted her a kodama plushie but i was never able to give it to her. i still have it. i can\u2019t stop crying if i think about her too much. i don\u2019t know what to do.",

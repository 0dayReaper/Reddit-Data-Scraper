    "postText": "I love pot. Ive been smoking everyday, multiple times a day for the past 2 years. However i HAVE been trying to stop for the past 6 months or so.\nThe weed is just taking a huge negative effect on my life. Or i am because I smoke weed, whatever.\n\nEverytime I try to talk to my mom about it, she just gets irritated and tells me how irrationally angry i am when I don't smoke.\n\nOr she gets super serious and asks me about where I'm gotta get weed from, how I'm gonna sleep, how I'm gonna chill.\n\nAnd it's like she doesn't hear I WANT to stop, it's like i tell her \"mother please i need it\" \n\nThe best example :\n\n\"Hey mom, fyi, this is my last joint and then I'll try to quit\" \n\n\"Oh, so you don't want the weed i have?\" \nAnd then she informs me she took some of my weed, in case I run out.\n\n\nAnd OBVIOUSLY I, AS A POTHEAD, TAKE THE DAMN WEED.\n\nOf course I'm at fault too for taking it, it's my decision to stop.\n\n\nBut if it's being presented on a silver plate it's just really hard to resist.\n\nIdk what I'm expecting here. But what are your opinions??? Is my mom kinda shitty for this? Am I just a brat???\n\nPls Thx",

            "comment": "If you have the means, go on a little trip for a week or two. Don't smoke during the trip and deal with the withdrawals without having your mom around. When you return, it'll be easier to resist her offering you weed because you don't get grumpy without it anymore and not smoking weed feels fine. I was similar in a way, I was a pothead and wanted to stop, but I couldn't if I had easy access to weed. If someone would be literally handing it to me it would've been tough to quit. Alternatively, maybe instead of going on a trip, crash at a friend's place for a while while you get clean. I wouldn't necessarily advice that though because you're gonna be grumpy for a couple of days and I wouldn't want to put a friend in that situation. Then again, if you talk about it and the friend is ok with it, you're golden.\n\nAlso ask yourself, why do you keep smoking weed? Are you trying to avoid negative emotions or stress? If that's the case, and you quit... Oh boy you might be in for a wild ride. All the negative emotions you've been smoking away can hit you in the face, all at the same time. It's not fun, but it's worth it. Let them, find a way to deal with them, solve what you can, make peace with what you can't, and be free. Don't look back.\n\nGood luck, I hope you're able to kick the habit! And if your smoking habit comes from avoidance, good luck with the shit you're dealing with, you're gonna be fine, even if it doesn't immediately feel like it!",

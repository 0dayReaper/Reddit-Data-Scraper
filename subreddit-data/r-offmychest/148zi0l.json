    "postText": "Well, after a 3-year struggle, I finally pushed my husband out of my house.\u00a0  \nHe has been unemployed since covid started, and struggling with mental health. He only worked for one week a year after COVID and he said his mental health made him so sick and unstable he could physically not get out of bed.\u00a0\n\n  \nWell, I supported him for 3 years while also going to college. Even in my last year when I had to take 4 months of classes out of state. I had to pay for a dorm and the mortgage so he stayed at home somewhat getting worse mentally. Then I came back home and started him in an outpatient\u00a0therapy group to try and help him. A week after I came home I also started my internship 1 \u00bd hours away from home that was a normal 40-hour work week that lasted 8 months.\u00a0\n\n  \nSo for the next 8 months, I was pulling 12-14-hour days all week, and barely could keep updated on my husband since all I had time for was work, driving, eating, sleeping, and trying to write research papers, do HW, and pass exams... Not a good time for me as a wife...\u00a0\n\n  \nWell, that ended halfway into the summer and I put the effort into finding a doctor for my husband since he didn't do that....\u00a0I found a nice doctor that was cute in his opinion; she located a therapist for us and we started that for him. We also started another medication for him.  \nMy husband also thought it would be a good idea for his mother-in-law to move in to help around the house. Since he could barely help keep the place clean while I was doing my internship and he thought it would help both of us with some money.\u00a0\n\n  \nWell, that lasted for about 4 months. In that time I graduated and got my job with new health insurance. I was also taking the husband to the Doctor at least\u00a0every month to keep updated with his meds and how he was doing.\u00a0\n\n  \nAfter, that 4 months when the new insurance kicked in we didn't get him back into a doctor until maybe one month later, and when we tried therapy again with the same person, he put it off because we were to busy with the holidays. By now I think he's tried 2 or 3 different brands of medications.\u00a0  \nWell, at the beginning of the year, my job changed insurance companies and my husband took another month off of therapy...\u00a0So late February we figure out the therapy, we figured out another medication, and started almost staying constant in going to therapy, trying to take medication, and making it to doctor appointments.\n\n  \nWell, during that time he missed a few appointments and therapy would charge my credit card $50 each time he missed.. and again he's still not working I'm the one paying the bills and having his mother live in my master bedroom.\u00a0  \nWell, we argued less while the mother-in-law was here but whenever she was gone for a few days, we would argue and I would tell him then maybe if you're not getting better then maybe it's time for you to leave.\u00a0\n\n  \nAround, April time the mother-in-law informed us she would be moving out in June almost a year later.\u00a0So now the arguments would include him moving out with his mother..This was also the time I said it's finally time to step up and get a job by May or at least by the time she moved out...\u00a0  \nTurns out he barley knew how to job search so I would have to be the one to make his resume. When he thought about the job, I was the one stuck looking for websites to apply on. Which he was applying to schools related jobs so it was easier to just go to the school website career section and apply since Google or Indeed was going to send you to the school website anyway... Well, that made him think that he should search for every job that way....\u00a0\n\n  \nI told him no I didn't think that you thought that way. I told you about Google, indeed, Glassdoor. I thought you knew to use\u00a0those websites\u00a0to search for a job...\u00a0  \nWell, he just now told me this two weeks into June... Clearly way past our deadline. And money is even tighter now that I don't have his mom's rent money.\u00a0\n\n  \nWell, our arguing finally got me to say again why don't you leave, go to your mom's or something....\u00a0And he literally says no, you'll have to do more then yell, and point to the door. And I ask him how, and he says you'll have to remove me yourself....\u00a0\n\n  \nSo we argue more and I finally say fine let's go to the door I'll walk you out..He again says it will take more than that... And I'm like so you want me a 180lbs woman\u00a0to move you a 400lbs man up two sets upstairs and out the door.. and I've already told him I don't want to get others involved... Why can't he just leave....\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \nWe argue about that more and I say okay, so I try to move him in his computer chair on the carpet... Of course, that does nothing...\u00a0We argue more, he finally quits playing Minecraft and I see him logging out of everything on his computer...\u00a0So I leave to shower and come back and say so are you leaving now that you logged out and blocked me on everything...\u00a0\n\n  \nHe says no again unless that's really what I want... I tell him well yes if we're not trying to fix things than please leave...\u00a0  \nSo he finally left...\n\n  \nI don't know how I feel. We've been together for almost 9 years.... But his mental health is killing my mental health and I know with no one but us in the house we're going to argue more often... I'm going to come home after working a full day to see his dishes and pan left in the sink, him asleep and not even started the day or put in a resume... And that's going to cause more arguing or me to go to my bed and sleep the rest of the day away...\u00a0\n\n  \nI can't help but feel halfway shitty for kicking him out at his low point.. but I also don't know how much longer I can support him... I'm 27 and now that I'm done with school and have a job I'm looking to move into the next step of adulthood like children .. And he's clearly not ready or capable of being at the milestone yet....\u00a0\n\n  \nAm I the bad person for finally kicking him out?\u00a0",

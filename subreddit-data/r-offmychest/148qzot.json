            "comment": "Hi! Thank you so much for sharing how you are feeling! I can totally relate to having imposter syndrome about your personality type. I love learning about all of the different personality tests (Myers-Briggs, Enneagram, etc), but every time I get my results, I wish I was something else. It is so easy to see all the flaws in your personality and see all the positives in others. It is important to remember that there are pros and cons to every personality, no one is perfect (even though it may appear that they are!). Each personality is needed and serves a purpose. There is a difference between not liking an aspect of yourself and actively taking steps to improve an aspect of yourself. While all personality types can improve themselves in some way, it is also healthy to recognize your strengths. I know it can be hard to recognize strengths in yourself, but do you have a mentor, friend, or parent you could ask about it? You are unique and have special gifts and talents. The world would not be the same without you in it! I have totally been where you are, but I have learned to appreciate who I am and the strengths I have been given. Please reach out if you would like to talk about this more!",

            "comment": "Part of that advice - about just being yourself - has a negative aspect, as in: Don't try to be someone else, or don't try to be something you're not. In that sense, it seems like pretty good advice to me. People have a knack of seeing through pretences and fakeness.\n\nYou know, in personality theory, especially in the so-called Big Five model of personality, there's no 'good' or 'bad' personality. Your personality just is how it is. Sure, some people like extroverts more than introverts, or they like open-minded people more than closed-minded ones. But our personalities, in and of themselves, aren't inherently 'bad' according to this view. It's a view with a lot of sense in it, in my opinion.",

    "postText": "So, I have this friend I'll talk to once in a while. More like a closer acquaintance really. I'll call her Macy. Macy has a condition that makes her mentally delayed. Mentally, she's about 10 years younger then her physical age. She's almost 30. We aren't super close, yet she seems to think we're practically sisters even though we mostly talk over text. Sunday was the first time I'd seen her face to face since November. With a reason. Talking with her is difficult. You have to hold up the conversation. You have to ask most of the questions. You know more about her then she does about you. \n\nSo, earlier this morning, she texted me about going to the ER about a searing pain in her lower abdomen. Apparently, a cyst on one of her ovaries, that they didn't know about, had ruptured. Of course, I'm glad she's okay. I haven't heard anything else about it. I've been hoping the ovary with the cyst gets taken out. I've heard from my grandmother about ovaries getting taken out if the damage is bad enough. (Grandma was the director of surgical services at a couple local hospitals for a long time). It can make getting pregnant harder for these women.\n\nA part of me hopes this happens for Macy. While I don't think Macy would abuse her kids, I can't get the possibility of her unintentionally neglecting them out of my head. For some reason, Macy becomes very uncomfortable when eating in public and doesn't like people looking at her while she eats. I wouldn't put it past her to put this onto her kids somehow. Maybe she wouldn't let them eat as much as they need to everyday because of her mentality and anxiety about it. \n\nI feel absolutely awful about this. I'm very pro choice. I think she'd be a great aunt once her brothers have kids. I wouldn't mind her being around my future kids. If only for a few hours and with supervision. The idea of not letting someone have control over their own body and choices is so foreign to me. I'm not sure how someone could genuinely believe it. At the same time, Macy having kids would seem like a disservice to those kids. At best, Macy's mom would end up raising those kids for her.",

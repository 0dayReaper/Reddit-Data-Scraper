    "postText": "This may sound dramatic, but this happened to me when I was 12. I had just gotten my braces off and the dentist was getting rid of the glue on my teeth. After he was done he said \u201cI shaved down your canines while I had the grinder out to make them look more feminine\u201d I asked what he meant and he lifted up a mirror, I had fairly sharp canines growing up that I really liked and he had shaved off a good amount and made them rounded instead of sharp. He said that boys would like me more and that he had made me more feminine and pretty. He didn\u2019t ask me about it, he just did it. Forever altered my teeth without my consent because I was a female. I went home and cried, I didn\u2019t know how to tell my parents so I didn\u2019t until much later and it was way too long after to do anything about it, I was 12 so I don\u2019t blame myself, but I do wish I had stood up for myself. I\u2019m still pretty upset about this 10+ years later because it just shows how girls get treated sometimes and the lack of bodily autonomy I was given. I hope it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else.\n\nEdit: Wow. I cannot believe this has happened to so many people. Imagine how many more that don\u2019t use reddit or haven\u2019t seen this post. I didn\u2019t realize this was so common. I am truly sorry for anyone this happened to. You deserved a choice.\n\nEdit 2: For those saying I only care about sexism if it affects females that is not true. I can only share my experience and what happened to me. I am against circumcision. I am against taking consent away from anyone. I will support any man who shares his story of sexism, however I cannot share a story of male sexism because it is not my story to tell, that\u2019s why mine is from the female perspective, because it is the only one that I have experienced and can share.",

Yes, OP was violated.   \n- This is also a thread specifically about sexism. OP has quoted the dentist, and his statement was blatantly sexist. There is no need to ask \u201c*Don't you think he just meant...?*\u201d He said exactly what he meant.     \n- This is *not* a thread about circumcision. While it is certainly a practice that shouldn\u2019t be ignored, it does not belong in this particular thread. Derailing, whataboutism, and playing Victim Olympics helps no one. (And this is not a debate sub. if you want to debate, go elsewhere.).   \n- This is a support sub. If you can\u2019t be supportive, be quiet.",

He was putting on the clamp that holds the rubber dam in place. (You know what is. It's that sheet of rubber that covers all of your teeth except the one that's being worked on.) Our patient was a twit. He got the clamp with these strange looking pliers, popped in onto her tooth, and it popped right off. He told her to turn her head toward him, so he could grab it. She sat up real fast and swallowed it. We were going to take her to the er, 2 miles away. When she sued us, she said that we made her go to the er alone. What ended up happening is that by the time they did the scope, it was in her stomach and the didn't want to risk injury on the way through her esophagus. She had to poo it out.\n\nEdit: this is a rubber dam clamp.\n\n https://images.app.goo.gl/S2vvSX2SPKhMBFqF8",

This was during a cleaning. He then had the nerve to try and charge for it. He had to go back and grind my other front tooth too so that they would line up (it was a fairly large corner chip). Worst part is my tooth is still slanted because it was impossible to grind away the whole chip.",

When I was four, I had open heart surgery to correct a congenital heart defect. I also have keloids that left the scar raised and quite prominent. When I was about 12 I went to a dermatologist to see if I could do any topical treatments to reduce the appearance of it. The dermatologist told me that I could, but that it would always be a prominent scar. The way that he told me (a 12 year old, insecure girl) was to say that I was \u201cdefinitely going to have to find a man that REALLY loves me one day,\u201d the implication being that no one would have sex with me, or find me sexually attractive without a shirt on unless they \u201cREALLY loved me.\u201d I was mortified. It still makes me sad to think about. Why he felt compelled to sexualize a shirtless, 12 year old patient (and also assume my sexuality) by telling me something demeaning and rude and awful...I\u2019ll never understand it. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m sorry that happened to you.

They are a bit large and I am a bit self conscious but I don't look truly deformed or anything so it's not a hauge deal. I wonder if I got the feminized as well? I know they usually soften out on their own when you become an adult but I never really had my vampire fangs. I really wanted them so I think they must have done it shortly after they came in, perhaps before putting on my braces? If they had told me I wouldn't have minded if they ground some of my front teeth a little but they just did the the 4 sharp ones. I wonder if I can have them restored somehow?",

As OP says in her next comment, it didn\u2019t occur to her to say anything because it was an adult that did it. The conditioning that adults are right and should be respected is very ingrained and hard to get past. Growing up I was (and still am) very attached to my mom and always felt I could tell her everything and did. However, I experienced sexual abuse at a young age from an adult and it wasn\u2019t until I was in my 30s that it even occurred to me that it was ok to say anything. Needless to say that once I told her she was devastated and felt it was her fault that I said nothing. I guess my point here is to not only let your daughter know that she can talk to you but also that adults aren\u2019t always right and that if she feels something is wrong, encourage her to act on those feelings and trust them. That\u2019s something I am still having to work on even in egregiously wrong situations.",

            "comment": "Very interesting to read this thread as a dentist (not doing any ortho work though).  Just goes to show how important it is to communicate with your patient. \n\nI think one reason why this kind of stuff happens to people is that with experience dentists get \"too\" familiar and sure of their work. I remember the first time I drilled a tooth, I was absolutely terrified. I just kept thinking that I am drilling a live tooth of a live human being. What if I drill too much, what if the filling I make isn't perfect? But as time goes on the mouth really turns into your territory, something you know and live everyday. The teeth belong to the patient, but because you have great expertise in all things dental and the patient often has none, you kind of  forget about the actual patient as a whole human being and solely focus on the tooth from perspective of dentistry. Every time a patient opens his mouth it becomes your world, that is all you see. It's like every day you are treating a different configuration of the same mouth. All mouths become one. So you just do your work according to the ideals you learned at dental school without consulting the patient. Becayse as professional you think you always know better. Okay I'm purposefully making a bit more dramatic and silly than how it actually is and of course this greatly varies between dentists too.\n\nI work for municipal dentistry clinic. I remember the lead dentist once telling us that he has never received a complaint about bad filling (came off too soon, was sharp, collected food etc.), the complaints are always about how patients feel they are treated. Isn't that interesting, in a field where you do a procedure on almost every single patient you see every single time no one actually complains about the procedures themselves,  they complain about the communication or lack of it. Communication can make or break you. \n\nLet me illustrate. Patients generally have no expertise in dentistry. Thus it's hard for them to actually judge the quality of the work. I know dentists that don't do superb job technically but are excellent communicators, and the patients love them. I also know dentists who do superb technical work and really give best treatment you can get, but get complaints because they are bad communicator.\n\nLet me give you an example. Patient comes in for an emergency visit due to toothache. The tooth in question is in a bad shape, nothing to do but to remove it. You explain this to patient and start the procedure. The neighboring tooth is also in bad shape but is not the source of pain and since this is an emergency visit you won't touch it. However during the procedure the neighbor breaks due to bad shape it is in (sometimes it just is necessary to use your instruments in a way where you have to support them against other tooth). This it not a problem from your perspective because it would had to be removed either way in the future. You knew there was a high probability of this happening, but you didn't bother to tell it to the patients. Now you're done with the procedure and tell the patient that unfortunately the neighbor tooth also broke during the procedure but it doesn't really matter because it was in bad shape. The patients leaves thinking you're a bad dentist making excuses and your lack of skill cost him two teeth instead of one.\n\nIf you were a good communicator you would have told everything before you started: \"There is a high risk of damaging this other tooth during extraction but all in all it does not matter since the tooth is also in very bad shape would have to be removed either way.\" Exact same things happen. Now the patient thinks you're a great dentist because you were able to foretell all this and he could prepare for what was about to happen.\n\nDamn, this turned into a long rant didn't it.",

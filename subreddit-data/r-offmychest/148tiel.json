It\u2019s something I can\u2019t change so I know I shouldn\u2019t beat myself up about it but my future wife is gonna have a sad sex life because of it. When I get close to someone, I tend to not go through with it and I know it\u2019s because subconsciously I\u2019m thinking \u201cshe doesn\u2019t deserve the disappointment.\u201d\n\nI just needed to put it out there. Has anyone else been in my shoes? Does anyone have any advice? Is this something I can talk to my therapist about? I\u2019m troubled.",

            "comment": "For some reason there's a plethora of other men posting micropenis stories today. But I think what you all have in common is none of you have actually sexually been with a woman. So you're scaring yourself before you even get there, I think only 1 guy I've read of today gets close to sex but still doesn't actually do it. So it sounds like you guys are psyching yourself out, and saving yourself from the imaginary disappointment of a woman laughing at you in bed when she sees your dick. Yes talk to a therapist, most definitely it will be good for you. And honestly if you get to the point of talking to a woman about sex just throw it in there that you have a small dick, if she's worth your while she won't let it bother her. Weed out who you want to share your time with. You need to start being confident and embracing it, not hiding before anything even happens.",

It\u2019s not about the size it\u2019s about what you can do with it. Connection and foreplay and all that really do matter. Not just size. A big issue I\u2019m seeing on all these posts is a confidence thing",

I go running everday at 4am, and thinking about it now if I was a chick especially an attractive one (let's be real) I wouldn't have that luxury. I was taking to one of my home girls who runs a good amount and to be quit frank shes really attractive. She tells me when she jogs at night she carries pepper spray and a knife. And I'm just like \"fuck dude I never have to worry about that nonsense\". \n\n\nEdit: LISTEN IF THERES ANYTHING YOU CAN TAKE FROM THIS POST IS EDUCATE YOUR PEOPLE WEATHER IT BE YOUR FAMILY,FRIENDS,COWORKERS ETC. I DIDN'T INTEND FOR THIS TO BLOW UP AT ALL IT WAS JUST CONVERSATION THAT I WANTED TO DISCUSS ON THIS PLATFORM. HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE EVEN IF ITS YOUR OWN.",

Because he was dating one of his driving students, who was 17. He was living at the bottom of his garden in a caravan with the student, while his soon-to-be-ex-wife stayed in the house. He must have been in his 30s I guess.\n\nI really have no idea what advice he expected me to give him, as I was 17 and couldn't relate to any of it, but I listened to all the crap and agony aunted him through it. If I'd been older, my reaction would probably have just been \"what the actual fuck\" which I guess is why he wanted a tiny baby psychotherapist.",

You're asking a woman to have a conversation along the lines of \"I like you enough to go on a date with you but I also have to see you as a potential threat because you're a dude I don't know well.\" And remember, this is with a dude clueless (or creepy) enough to suggest a secluded early date. As a woman, I would not like to have that conversation. It's making the guy confront his male privilege in the context of romantic tension. Guys might start arguing why they're different and safe. That's a pointless and exhausting. Guys might decide you're not serious or into them enough, and you might have thrown away a budding romance. Guys might tell you you're overreacting or it's all in your head. And that sort of thing stings way worse when you're into the guy.\n\nSo who should be educating the clueless? Their parents, for a start. Every woman I know seems to have gotten the safety tips to avoid gender based violence. Why aren't guys getting a similar talk? Female friends should educate their male friends. I've had that kind of conversation a bunch of times and it typically goes very well. Male friends can also discuss the problem. It's a broad societal problem so responsibility for educating guys about it should be spread broadly as well.",

You dont have to be half drunk in alley for something scary to happen and I dont think a lot of guys realize that. My brother thought that the big scary men only came after skimpy women at night acting vulnerable &amp; alone.

We realized there were two guys mid to late 20s eyeing us. But we don't scare easy so we brush it off. To get to the mall we have to take a bus then two more and so then we realize when we got off to wait for the second that we were being followed. When we got off and went to a icecream shop right in front of the second bus stop  these guys also went in. We did that so we would be around other people incase they tried anything. Anyways they went on the third and then also got off at the mall. We had to call our cousins to come with us after the whole thing because they did all that. We thought that people would at least not try shit in the middle of the day, we were wrong.",

I would go so far as to say that the majority of men have a hard time doing this, and that partially explains why there are so many \u201cnice guys\u201d and even \u201cnice guys\u201d who get fed up and lash out on the female gender with violence. I know it doesn\u2019t fully explain where they come from, but it makes sense to me that it is easier for them to do those things when they look at women in a certain way - to serve a need.\nEdited for grammar.",

Told him I was just skating laps and he can do his roller hockey thing still. And then didn\u2019t talk to him \n\nWithin 15 mins he\u2019s circling me like I\u2019m a cone as I\u2019m skating laps and tapping his stick on my shoulder or my back. \n\nNo. Just no. \n\nWould he do that to another male? Most likely not. I had to cut my exercise session short because he didn\u2019t know personal space or social cues that I was not interested in conversation. \n\nNow I haven\u2019t gone back at the same time of day in case he\u2019s there. \n\nI\u2019ve completely changed my workout schedule because he couldn\u2019t respect personal distance or my own words saying I just wanted to skate. \n\nWould that happen to someone if they were male? Most likely not.\n\nEdit: phrasing\n\n\nEdit 2:: just got done skating for the day. Thought I saw him at the rink when I pulled up. So I turned out of the parking lot, watched to see if he noticed, and went to the skateboard park where there are always people. \n\nAgain. Females \u2014&gt; you understand me completely. I gave up an almost empty skate rink to skate a teenagers in a skateboard park for my roller skating. Because I felt safer getting clobbered by one of them coming down the ramps than alone with possibly creepy guy. \n\nI\u2019m 42.\n\nEDIT 3 :: Curious why the downvoting on this comment. Not being argumentative, just truly curious. I don\u2019t quite understand how it qualifies for that. Did it offend you somehow that I felt uncomfortable by someone not respecting my want to be left alone while roller skating?",

I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on it and thankfully I have other places to skate where I wouldn\u2019t be stuck on a rink that you can\u2019t really see into unless you\u2019re up close.

Go back to the kitchen!\" Ive only met a handful op people who didn't mind and who would just game with me. The first one is obviously not that bad, but whenever I'd say that I'd rather not give any personal information to strangers, it would turn into the second option. It doesn't bother me anymore, but I used to feel sad about it back in the day. Thank you for thinking about this! :)\n\nEdit: typo's",

Rapists (whether male or female), like muggers and other criminals, are always on the prowl.

So far, I've been verbally harassed by perverted comments by strangers (on two occasions they were women in their 20's, on three they were men in their 20's or 30's, and on all occasions I was under 17 years old at the time); and thrice strangers have tried to chat me up and grope me (once on a train, once in a fast food place, and another time in a disco).\n\nBut when it came to threats of sexual violence and attempted date-rape, it has always come from people that I knew well -- fellow students at college; a colleague who's a part of my friend circle...\n\nTo have your trust breached like that, and to be realize that that guy only faked niceness in order to lull you into a false sense of security, makes the harassment even worse. It's easy to press charges against a stranger and to feel like you were the victim of a crime. It's more difficult when you know the other person. Depending on your workplace, you might be punished for trying to \"rock the boat\" by reporting sexual harassment; at college or high school, you will be bullied by other students for pressing charges against one of their friends; and if it's a relative, especially if it's your SO, you'll be hard-pressed to find moral support of any kind, and to successfully punish the rapist. Society also stigmatizes victims of rapists or  harassers who knew them -- frequently, the victims are accused of having been a \"tease\", or having \"second thoughts\" after giving consent, or being intoxicated. Rape kits and medical examinations are never taken into consideration at court. Even photographic and video evidence is rarely considered. For whatever reason, courts almost exclusively go by the court of opinion -- the police will interrogate people who are friendly with the rapist and then decide that the rapist \"wouldn't have done such a thing.\" Theoretically, if you're intoxicated and somebody has sex with you, they are committing an act of rape, point blank. But in practice, if you were intoxicated, regardless whether you had been given a date-rape drug unbeknownst to you, or you had drunk alcohol voluntarily, your rapist will go scot-free because courts are biased against intoxicated, inebriated or even sleeping victims.",

            "comment": "When I was 18 (I\u2019m a female btw) I moved from a small town of less than 10000 people to Downtown Toronto. It\u2019s important to mention that the \u201csmall town culture\u201d turns you into a very trusting person, since almost every time you walk down the street you run into someone you know, which creates a sense of safety. When I moved to Toronto, I took my habit of trusting people with me. \n\nWhen I first got to Toronto, I started going to a hookah bar alone during the day (when it was basically empty) so I could smoke hookah while reading/studying. I remember one time at 2pm, I walked in and it was pretty packed &amp; I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d actually get any reading done with all the commotion. One of the staff members (they all recognized me now since I had been going there often to read; they\u2019re also all male) offered to let me read in the staff room, since they just had a small tv playing quietly and it wouldn\u2019t be as loud. I agreed, and at first everything was fine, I was just reading and a couple staff members were watching tv. \n\nThen, one of the staff members asked me if I\u2019d like some tea. I told him I\u2019d love some tea. He brought out a tray with three tea cups (one for me, one for each of the staff). I thanked him, and I decided I would make small talk with the staff member for 5 minutes while I sipped on my tea (it was the polite thing to do, since he made me tea &amp; wasn\u2019t charging me for it, and I didn\u2019t mind having a small chat). \n\nBut then moved closer to me, and he put his arm around me, so I quickly told him I had to get back to studying. He respected it, and left me alone to study. But 15 minutes went by and I began to feel nauseous. I couldn\u2019t think straight, I couldn\u2019t concentrate. I was stuck on the same sentence of my book for the past 5 minutes. I decided it was time to go home, something clearly wasn\u2019t right with me. \n\nI stood up, but I stumbled, because my balance was off. I couldn\u2019t see properly, and I was beginning to get dizzy. I packed my stuff and exited the staff room. The stairs down to the front door should have been on my right, but they weren\u2019t there? I asked the staff member at the front desk where the front door was, and he looked at me with a concerned face: \u201cThe door is right behind you. Are you okay? Do you need help down the stairs?\u201d I said thank you, but no thank you, and I rushed down the stairs, my hands holding onto the walls for stability like I\u2019m drunk. \n\nWhen I got down to the street, I took three steps down the sidewalk before I began to vomit. I sat on the sidewalk puking into the street for five minutes, and then I immediately felt better. I walked home and I\u2019ve never been back to that place since. \n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly what happened to me, but I\u2019m fairly certain I was being drugged. I\u2019m lucky I got out of there and managed to puke it up, otherwise I genuinely don\u2019t know what might have happened to me in that staff room.",

And it\u2019s been so, so eye opening to see the things that I put up with during my time as a woman, and how it\u2019s changed since I started medically transitioning.\n\nFor example: when I was trying to quit smoking, my sister (who had been vaping for at least a year or two at that point) took me to a vape shop. I knew nothing about vaping, she knew mostly everything\u2014and when we got there, the guy at the store was looking at ME. Talking to ME. Asking ME all the questions. Completely ignoring my sister; even though she knew all there was to know about vaping and I had no clue.\n\nOn top of that, looking back on some of the predatory things guys said to me from the age of 13/14 up......it\u2019s just so, so fucked up.\n\nI see the world differently now because I\u2019ve lived as both male and female. My social circle is about 99% female, and I am thankful because I have been able to understand their experiences and recognize that it happens, and men are definitely treated better in society than women are for sure. It\u2019s a fucked up world we live in\u2014people treat men better because they don\u2019t see women as they truly are: strong, independent, powerful women that get overlooked because society not only sexualizes them, but doesn\u2019t take them seriously. And it infuriates me.\n\nI\u2019m very thankful that I have seen the world from both sets of eyes because it\u2019s really opened my eyes and taught me a lot about the way women are treated and how I really do have it so much better as a man. And I\u2019m thankful that as you as a cis man can recognize this; a lot of cis men don\u2019t even have a clue. It\u2019s good to be aware and acknowledge that it happens, and it\u2019s not right at all.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t know WHY my comment got downvoted.

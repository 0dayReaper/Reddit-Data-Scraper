    "postText": "My college friend died today. \nShe fell ill and hospitalized in april, because of what we think was an autoinmmune disease (the doctors weren't sure about it).\n\nThe disease became very aggresive and within two days of being in the hospital she needed blood transfusion. I immediately went to the hospital and gave my blood to her, I just wanted her to recover so we could meet again. She was the kindest human being alive.  She would always try to help me when I didn't have money to eat, or when I needed to pay for something and couldn't afford it. Her birthdays were the most fun, the last time I gifted her a stuffed rabbit and I'll never forget her eyes shining with joy. \nShe was always so grateful about what she had and the friendship our group built. She had the sweetest eyes I've ever seen. \n\nThe last day I saw her, she said that her stomach was hurting. I just told her to go home, rest, drink some tea and she would be all better soon. She never came back.\n\nI just can't understand how this happened. One day I was laughing by her side and the next day she was at the hospital, almost dying. \n\nShe fought for a long time against the disease, but she didn't make it.\nA couple of days ago I had a dream were we met, and I was so happy because she was finally okay. I hugged her so tightly, and she told me to be careful because she was in a lot of pain. I like to think that she came to my dreams to say goodbye. \n\nI miss you, my friend. I'll see you again on the other side.",

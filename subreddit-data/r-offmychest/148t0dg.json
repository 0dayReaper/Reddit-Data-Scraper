    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nApologies in advance, on mobile.\n\nYesterday I broke up with my long-term partner of almost 5 years. I saw him sneaking around on his phone and it just crossed a boundary that we couldn\u2019t come back from. I gave up a lot of myself to be there for him and I was there for him during his toughest moments while getting 0 to nothing from him.\n\nI wish I could say I\u2019m heartbroken or sad, but I\u2019m not. I know that I tried my best and that I didn\u2019t deserve that kind of treatment for him. I feel free from someone who\u2019s life was always falling apart and I\u2019m happy to see what\u2019s next in life. \n\nHe deserves to find someone just like him and I hope he has the life he deserves.",

    "postText": "To keep anonymity I\u2019ll be a bit vague but my parent and their sibling both have a genetic disability passed on from their parent. This disability is similar to Parkinson\u2019s \n\nMy whole life I have been terrified as my odds were 50/50. The disease sets in around 25-27. I\u2019m 26 and had some slight tremors start 9 months ago. I finally got tested, sure that I was doomed. \n\nAfter a very long and stressful 9 months, my test came back in. It is negative. My shaking stopped 3 months ago. (still don\u2019t know what that was) The weight of this is off my shoulders. I have no biological siblings that could be effected by this, so the disease stops with me and the family tree no longer has this gene. \n\nIdk why I\u2019m writing this but if you made it this far, thanks for listening.",

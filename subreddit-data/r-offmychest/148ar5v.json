    "postText": "I come home from work and my plants are missing, my food in the freezer bought a month ago and non perishables in my little drawer are all gone. I know it was my mother because she has done this before. No explanation for my plants because \"she doesn't know where they went\"??, as for the food there is a rule that I was never informed of and suddenly exists today that I can only keep food for 2 weeks before it is tossed. I was not asked if my food already there was within that criteria.\n\nBut her things are exempt from this rule. I can't use her logic back at her or I'll face severe punishment.\n\nGosh I wish I could move out",

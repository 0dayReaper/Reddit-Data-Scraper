    "postText": "This week I\u2019ve been looking at myself and wondering what\u2019s wrong with me. I started looking up disabilities or disorders because when I was a kid I have trouble explaining things. It\u2019s frustrating when someone doesn\u2019t know what I am saying. And it blends with my bpd and I become enraged. I can\u2019t explain how I feel and people just brush it off. All I want to do is scream but can\u2019t. I am (mildly) Intellectual disability. I don\u2019t know if that has anything to do with it. I feel like there\u2019s a lot more wrong with me.",

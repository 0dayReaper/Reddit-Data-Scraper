    "postText": "hi, 16m throwaway account. sorry if formatting is weird, im on my phone.\n\nshe was my older brother's girlfriend. i was 14, she was 19. she was spending the night while my parents weren't home, and after my older brother went to bed she came into my room and started talking to me. i thought it was kinda weird but i didnt think she had any bad intentions. and then she just kind of.. lunged at me. like a hungry wolf. i dont remember most of it. i just remember looking at her and feeling like i was out of my body, like it was some kind of weird dream or sleep paralysis. she told me she wanted to do this since she first met me, which is fucking crazy because she started dating my brother when i was 11. i threw up afterwards.\n\ni didnt tell anybody about it for a few weeks. i felt like it was my fault because i got a boner (but after some research, i learned that wenises just kind of... do that sometimes and there was no way for me to control it!). i felt like i was being a hypocrite for calling it rape because she made me... you know....... finish. if you will. im trying to be as PG as possible lmfao. \n\nthe first person i told was my brother. he started yelling at me, asking me why i would make up something serious like that. a couple days later, he broke up with her. i asked him why, and he said it was because he was mad at her for \"seducing me.\" and when he said that, i just kind of shut down, because that just confirmed my fear: it wasnt rape and i was just an idiot. i told my friend about it. he called me lucky. he said any guy my age would love to have an older girl like that. i didnt say anything about it after that.\n\ni dont really know why im posting this. i think im still worried that it really was my fault all along; or that i wasnt actually raped and i deserved it, or i lead her on somehow and didnt realize it. idfk. im not doing very good. idk. i dont think i'll ever have sex",

I don't remember much of it either.\nI'm sorry your brother wasn't supportive. When my brother heard what she did (because she was dumb enough to brag that she took my V-card), he got so mad that she had to leave our town and disappear. \nI remember even telling him it wasn't a big deal, because I didn't want him to get in trouble for me. I was in denial for a while about it.\nSo I want you to know, buddy, what happened to you isn't normal. It shouldn't have happened. But don't let it ruin your life. Don't let it ruin your relationships with other people. And more than anything, don't let it destroy your selfworth. It's not your fault and you did nothing wrong.\nI'm almost 30 now, I'm doing better and I had healthy relationships. But I spent over 10 years letting other people abuse me.

You are correct in you findings that your genitals have built in responses to stimulation and arousal can occur wether you\u2019re consenting to it or not, *liking it or not.* This is a concept called \u201cArousal Non-Concordance\u201d and happens with many SA and CSA survivors. I highly suggest you looking into it and relaying/talking about what you find and feel with your therapist.\n\nI went through something quite similar when I was younger and like you, I was terrified of what happened and mortified at what my body did in response despite me not truly wanting or liking it at the time. Please know that while many of those immediately around you may not understand or even go so far as to assert the what you experienced was something different. Something you chose. It was not. It was real and many, too many male perceived individuals have gone through what you had to and also receive little compassion if not outright invalidation. \n\nI am a little older now and have done enough study and therapy to get past a lot of the hurt that stayed with me after those experience. At least, most of the hurt that is. I genuinely hope that you receive the recognition and kindness that you need and deserve after something like this. \n\nYour feelings and your choices are valid and real. I am so very sorry for what you had and have to go through. I hope that things get better soon as there is good out there for you as there is for all of us.\n\nIf nothing else, my DMs are open to you if you ever need to talk or vent about anything.

Your body realizes that there is someone \u2018attractive\u2019 (idk whether you found her attractive or not, but at least attractive in the sense of vagina and boobs are nice) and your physical reaction was a boner, just because that happens doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve given consent.

I\u2019m glad that you\u2019ve come to the conclusion that it was rape and are able to work on it now. Acceptance is the first step in healing - even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it.

Even if the minor wanted it, it's still rape, because minors cannot consent to sex with adults. You were raped and I hope this validates how you feel so you can stop blaming yourself for it. It's hard being a male rape victim, it's so different; everyone high fives you, says you're lucky, and tells you to stop complaining. While you're sitting there confused as to why everyone is cheering you on for being raped. I hope you seek therapy my brotha you deserve it.",

Anything less than consent is rape. \n\nIt\u2019s hard for other guys to understand not wanting to fuck anyone at any moment. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m a dude who is horny as hell all the time, but sex for me has to be emotional as well. And even if you get hard that\u2019s not consent. If you cum that\u2019s not consent. Blood will flow to your wiener if it\u2019s messed with, and if it\u2019s messed with long enough it\u2019ll orgasm. That\u2019s just biology. Especially when you\u2019re young and going through puberty. But this can happen against your will. \n\nI was actually in a very similar position as you. It just didn\u2019t go as far. But when I was 13 my older brothers gf was like 16 and she came into my room one day and got down on her knees and started rubbing my thigh and I was like \u201cuhhh. What are you doing?\u201d And she was like \u201cteehee\u201d then left. She always did shit like that. Back then I was NOT ready for anything sexual. I didn\u2019t really understand it and I was low key afraid of it. Sure I was going through puberty and jacking off all the time, but I was not anywhere near ready for sex. It probably would have traumatized me if I was forced into it, especially by my brothers gf because who wants to hurt their brother by fooling around with their gf? But she definitely tried a few times. \n\nBut yeah man. Don\u2019t feel bad you were taken advantage of and I\u2019m sorry people don\u2019t understand that",

We, as a society, have to do better when it comes to discussing SA across the board but especially with young men and boys. So many don't report it or are in a similar situation as you and are confused as to what to call it because they're young, aren't 100% on how their bodies work or feel they'll be emasculated in the eyes of others. \n\nIf you're in the US, please call the National Sexual Abuse Hotline 1.800.656.4673. They can help you find counseling in your area and point you in the direction of getting other help you may need like medical testing for STI's and talking with your parents or the authorities if you choose to do so. You can also Google them and chat online if that's easier for you. \n\nI really hope you understand that this wasn't your fault. It was wrong on so many levels and I'm sorry you're having to go through it. Nobody deserves it.",

IF you are not able to talk to your parents about this, is there anyone at school, a guidance counselor, a school therapist or a teacher you feel you can trust?\n\nIf you want to keep it anonymous, go online, start by searching for rape victims support services.  Most of the services are geared toward women, but they can help you.\n\nIf you can get to a Planned Parenthood clinic, they can help you.\n\nYou are not alone.  You are not the only teenage boy this has happened to.  There are people who can help you work through this.  Please, reach out to someone, you should not be dealing with this alone.\n\nI was molested as a teen, by a female relative.  It took me years to accept that it even happened and longer before I was able to talk to anyone about it.  Those were wasted years.  Trauma doesn't just fade away.  You won't get better unless you find someone to help you.  \n\nYour life is not over, there is a lot more to come and it can be wonderful if you deal with this trauma now.  I'm 64 now and I have had a great life so far, but I've had a lot of help along the way.  I hope you can find the strength to find someone to help you.",

You are 100% valid and your perception of that event is the only one that matters as far as you &amp; your life are concerned. \n\nI am so sorry that happened to you, but I sincerely believe that you will be able to overcome this with therapy\u2026hopefully sooner rather than later. A therapist will genuinely listen and understand and they will be YOUR advocate. They will help you have difficult conversations about this with the appropriate individuals at the appropriate time. \n\nAdditionally, journaling my feelings/emotions/thoughts always help me process. Even if this event is one that you have to process over and over again, it will get easier to do and talking about it with trusted individuals will also get easier. \n\nAlso, just as a reminder (and something that you should make a habit to remind yourself EVERY DAY), this was not your fault. Period. You were a child, you are a victim in this situation. You are entitled to the trauma and healing journey that you are on. You do not need to feel shame or guilt about any part of this situation. You are entitled to your thoughts/feelings/emotions/experiences. \nFinally, in the scariest moments, in this moments where you feel shame, fear, and guilt (particularly when opening up with others about this), please remind yourself of how brave you have ALREADY been. Remind yourself of how brave that 14 yr old boy was to tell his brother. And you did it. Sure, he may have chosen the wrong words in response or felt flustered/overwhelmed with the information, but ultimately, he did right. He chose you. \nAnd even though he may have needed some time to process before acting, he came to the conclusion that SHE was in the wrong and that you were a victim. \n\nIt will feel scary to open up about this, but you ARE brave enough. And you will be surprised by how much that level of vulnerability will change your life. Something in the future that your 12 yr old self would have been scared of will seem minuscule when compared against the bravery you have shown by taking these steps to truly heal! \n\nI am so proud of you and I know you can keep moving forward!!!",

You\u2019re probably not the only young man she\u2019s done this to, and if left unchecked, she may put other young men through this same thing. \n\nI know it\u2019s a heavy thing to think about reporting to the police, having to tell them what happened and reliving all that\u2026 I really hope you can find the strength to do it, her future would-have-been victims would probably thank you for it. However, if that\u2019s not something you\u2019re ready or able to do (which is okay, please don\u2019t blame yourself if you can\u2019t do it), find a good therapist. Someone you trust and have a good rapport with. Let them help you unpack all of these feelings and work through what happened. Let them help you find a path to healing and a happy tomorrow. \n\nThis awful woman left a black mark on your adolescence, but you don\u2019t have to let her ruin the rest of your life too. You still have a bright future ahead and a wonderful life is still possible for you. We are all here to support you and talk you through this if needed. Be strong my friend, and let the same courage that enabled you to tell us about this drive you forward to claim the future you deserve.",

It's getting to the point of depression that I have never felt or been in before.\n\nThis isn't a cry for help, or any advice, just to say my piece and just get on with whatever cards I have left until I fold.",

Yes, employers like if you have good grades, but what stands out to them most is the work you've put in already and your attitude to learn and work. I mean look at this for example, say you're the employer:\n\nA) Good grades, ok attitude, some work experience.\n\n\nB) Bad grades, great attitude, good amount of work experience.\n\nI'd definitely pick B, and realistically if they pick A then they are not people you wanna be working for, seems like they wouldn't value you as a person properly compared to the employer who chooses B.\n\nSo just keep going, keep looking for work, eventually you'll find it, if you have absolutely nothing left to lose maybe even consider joining the Army, they'll take more or less anyone. Just keep trying, it's such a waste to just end it, I think of it sometimes but I don't because despite the extreme odds we were born, and we should make the most of it, even if society is hard on us, just keep trying man, you're not a failure and you're not nearing the end, just do whatever you have to do and work hard for it, it's all a person can ask, maybe you won't earn a huge amount but you'll be living at least, that's what really matters, the rest can be worried about once you've managed that much. Good luck.",

Either way it can really help create a decent impression when you do that, really the only tip I can give, I can't understand your struggle since I'm only 18 and I've only had a few jobs, but if you need one then being in person and being presentable can really create an impression, good luck friend.",

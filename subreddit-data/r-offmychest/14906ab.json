    "postText": "Basically the title. \n\nHe's called me names and claimed I start arguments for my own enjoyment. These arguments are often about things he's said that I find hurtful, incorrect, or just plain unkind towards others. I try to engage in constructive conversation or try to get him to understand how I feel or how others might feel about what he says, but I often end up finding myself in tears, trying to defend my actions or understand his while he insults me, calls me cruel names, claims I'm misinterpreting him or misremembering or putting words in his mouth, and essentially calls me stupid and/or crazy. It feels so much like gaslighting - the real kind where you question your reality or the way things really happened - but he says it's not and if anything, I'm gaslighting him. Nothing ever gets resolved unless I resolve it myself and I rarely, if ever, get an apology. It feels like he changed, but he says I changed. And he's been so mean in general lately, nothing like what he was like several years ago. He used to be so good to me. My mom says I should do what I want but she also says that she thinks that my life will be hard with him.\n\nI feel so many conflicting feelings about this. I don't know what to do. I want to have arguments like a good couple, ones where we argue in a respectful way because we love each other and we want to resolve the problem and be better for one another, not these vile attacks where I end up nauseous and miserable, wondering if maybe I'm actually the problem like he says, and he ends up angry and stops responding to me. I want kindness and respect to be the default, not something I have to *beg* or ask him to do. I want to have those long, intellectual conversations that I used to have with him instead of him essentially talking at me and not letting me get a word in without being told I'm \"talking over\" him. He can't even put into words what he *likes* about me, but he has plenty of words for things he dislikes! I want to *feel* loved, damn it, not be *told* that. \n\nI just. Want him to be nice to me. Is that so much to ask?",

He doesn't treat you well when you have arguments, he is disrespectful and also calls you names. \n\nI think you should tell him all of this that you wrote, what you are feeling. How he treats you is a problem and you want a change. If you feel you can't talk to him - can you write him a letter?\n\nIt sounds also that you need strategies when you talk to each other. Maybe state some rules when having disagreements.\n\nWhat you write also makes me wonder about your partners mental health. \n\nTake care, hope things works out for you two.

I don\u2019t care my son had a bone marrow transplant in November, he had leukemia. Needs check ups ever month still. I am not risking him and I am not risking his sister catching it and give it to him. This craze of opening e rey thing up and leaving people vulnerable. Ridiculous",

A lot of us feel unsafe coming to school, which may have a few hundred up to thousands of people from so many different households and in mostly close proximity. The school I\u2019m in doesn\u2019t exactly respect social distancing either)\nTrump\u2019s idea to do that is utter crap. Isn\u2019t the US already facing a surge in cases? This is a very bad time to be focusing more on getting things back to normal because they shouldn\u2019t feel normal. But what he\u2019s trying to do here is get the economy back up so he can earn votes. Anyway, I really can\u2019t imagine how unsafe Americans must feel on a daily basis.

What grandparents aren't going to want to see their grandchildren?  And as much as we love them kids are dirty, and wont follow any health guidelines.  If they get CV at school they are going to bring it home and compromise their families, which often time include the entire spectrum of age ranges up through elderly.\n\nTrump has no right to be shooting from the hip with regards to children's lives.  I was angry about how he was handling things before, but when the narcissistic fuck started saying he was going to force schools to open or stop funding them I hit a level of rage I've never experience before.  Those are our tax dollars he is threatening to take away from teachers and put our kids at risk against the advice of experts, not his money.  As a parent  I would put my life on the line to protect children, all children, healthy or not.  Don't get me wrong, I also think if a parent wants to send their child back to school it should be optional, that is their choice.",

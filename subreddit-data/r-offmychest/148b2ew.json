    "postText": "After roughly 6 years of hell - Grief, remorse and confusion... I feel unburdened at last!\n\nI went through a breakup and a while afterwards my ex ghosted me. I was told that he was saying things about me that weren't nice and made me question myself, our time together and well - everything. I've been haunted for years by the loss and unsure how to fix or straighten things out. Doubting my perception of myself and the way others saw me too.\n\nBut the other night some friends told me that he does ask about me and cares. And they think we will be okay and in time we'll resolve things and be friends again.\n\nJust knowing that he does ask about me out of concern/ become he cares shifted something that's been lurking for years and I finally feel at peace. Sounds like my ex after him was skewing my perspective of things after all. The things I thought they thought of me and therefore questioned in myself were really tough to swallow. But knowing that they do actually care still and don't think those things has set me free.\n\nHe's seeing someone new (who I know and have great respect for) and I know she's never had issues with me and has always been very understanding of the things I've been dealing with over the past decade. So that adds hope to the situation as I trust she'll be good for him and his emotional avoidant tendencies/ difficulties with processing and communicating his feelings. And maybe we'll restore communication at some point and move forward at last. And not being filled with doubts and questions about certain aspects of his experience will make me much easier for him to re-engage with.\n\nSo many reasons to be grateful today!!",

I FUCKING hate it so much. It gets extremely hot where I live, and it's literally unbearable. I absolutely despise wearing summertime clothes as they look ridiculous on my extraordinarily hairy body. Don't get me wrong, I love when it's sunny and stuff, but not when it's fucking ~35-40\u00b0C outside (~95-140\u00b0F). Summer is the worst of all four seasons.",

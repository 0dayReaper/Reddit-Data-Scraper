    "postText": "I usually shower with the bathroom door open. I sing in the shower a lot. My boyfriend recently moved in and he started singing back to me when I\u2019m in the shower.\nIf you know anything about crazy big curly hair, you know it takes FOREVER to wash. So I have shower days that are \u201chair wash\u201d days and it takes me so long! A couple weeks ago I was washing my hair and got bored of singing so I shouted to my boyfriend \u201cI\u2019m lonesome!\u201d\nHe said he\u2019d keep me company and smoke weed on the bathroom floor while I wash my hair.\nEvery once in a while I\u2019ll wash my hair and yell out \u201cI\u2019m lonesome!\u201d And he just comes in and does the same thing.\nI guess we developed this routine because today I said \u201cI\u2019m gonna shower\u201d and he goes \u201chair day?\u201d And before I answer he just starts packing his bowl and follows me into the shower, sits down, and starts singing.\n\ud83d\ude02\nI love it.",

Also, pro-tip, we usually just let the other know when we\u2019re close to getting out and then they\u2019ll pop the towel in the dryer. So when you get out, you have a warm towel. Honestly not the best for energy but our place is super efficient and it makes getting out of the shower better. Also love the \u201cI\u2019m lonesome\u201d phrase y\u2019all have going on!! We just always ask \u201cwill you come talk to me while I\u2019m in there?\u201d :) So anyway thanks for this wholesomeness - I love it!! Best to all of you!!",

You can part the hair in small sections, maybe 4-8 depending on how comfortable you feel working with the amount of hair in each. To separate the hair into sections, use your fingers, nails, or even a wide-tooth comb starting from the scalp to make lines and then gather the hair into scrunches or big hair clips. \nThen, starting from the ends of the hair, brush out each section slowly, making sure not to force the brush through but let the hair de-tangle with the softness from the conditioner and slight firmness from the brush (you don\u2019t want the hair snapping, if you need to add more conditioner do so!) \nThen when you\u2019re done detangling each section, you can either cover the hair with a plastic cap and let it sit in conditioner for a few more minutes or rinse out the conditioner immediately.\nAfter that, you use moisturizing products to add moisture to the hair and style it. You can find videos on YouTube that explain this whole process and are even geared for each type of hair texture.",

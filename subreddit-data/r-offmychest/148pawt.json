    "postText": "I am just needing to rant. But I am so tired of the capitalistic world of greed that we live in. Canada is broken and the world is so heartbreaking. I feel ashamed to be a member of society that contributed to the greed we see today. \n\nI know there are good honest people out there, but these corporations and governments are making it a horrendous country and world. \n\nPeople are so divided and refusing to see each others validity just to make points for their own cause. \n\nIn turn people are getting hurt, going bankrupt and no one is willing to cut people slack or assist unless it\u2019s for their own benefit and praise. \n\nI want to confront the world as we know it so that it could be better. But it feels like everyone says let\u2019s stand and rise against, but no one is willing to actually fight for it.\n\nI\u2019m just so ashamed of the world my child will grow up in. I just want the world of support and love and honesty to be here. No longer this world of greed and cutthroat individualism under causes.",

    "postText": "A year ago I posted on this account that I was going to quit drugs. I was vaping and smoking weed all day everyday to manage my depression and anxiety. Looking back, that made me feel a lot worse and put a lot more stress on me. I finally quit though, last time I smoked was 7 months ago. It\u2019s not much but I\u2019m trying my best everyday, and considering how many people around me around willing to quit on their own term, I\u2019m pretty happy that I did.",

It\u2019s life. And you\u2019re responsible for your own mental health. Don\u2019t feel bad for preserving it.",

Even asking for a break so they could both focus on their own mental health sent her into a downward spiral of constant messages, emails, calls and even calls to his family etc. \nI honestly think if you know what she is suffering from and can speak to a therapist about the best ways to deal with someone with that illness and go from there.\nGood luck, I know this is probably the hardest thing for you to do but you need to look after yourself before you can look after someone else",

If you just cut her off she will spiral and the guilt that comes with finding out they have hurt themselves because of you is something I wouldn't wish on anyone. \n\nI was straight up with my ex best-friend. She had been draining my mental health for over a year, I was on edge, walking on eggshells, constantly crying and so overtired from all the midnight texts and phone calls. \n\nShe did something I didn't approve of and I told her straight out her behaviour was unacceptable and she really needed to take a good hard look at herself and how she treats people. \n\nShe blocked me on everything and it has been five months of peace, and me finding my happiness again. I would never regret it.",

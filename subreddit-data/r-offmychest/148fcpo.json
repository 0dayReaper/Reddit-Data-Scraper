    "postText": "25 year old male, about to Graduate from a health science bachelors (Bachelor of Health science Nutrition and Exercise). I\u2019m trying to fool myself into believing this degree was a good choice and I will be able to weasel into some kind of health care job / government job with it (health promotion, education dept, health and safety etc) but everything I\u2019m hearing and reading is saying that a health science BA is only useful for getting into a graduate degree like physical therapy, podiatrist etc. I simply can\u2019t go straight into another degree after this or I\u2019ll have a mental breakdown and am worried it may lead me to lean towards ending things early if you know what I mean. This has already been in my mind for some years due to things that have happened around me. Health science is the 2nd degree I\u2019ve done and the only one I will complete, and it riddles some with anxiety and dread to think this has all been a huge waste of time and I\u2019ll either have to go into a grad program and continue working my current retail job to support myself while contending with at least one undiagnosed mental problem( I have been told I have \u201cpanic disorder\u201d but I feel like it may be more an OCD type thing based on my hypochondria fueled research)\u2026 or I won\u2019t find a job with this degree if it really is useless by itself, not do a grad degree out of stress, stay in my current job and look for other awful retail jobs because that\u2019s all I\u2019m able to work in unfortunately , and end up killing myself within the next 2 years. It\u2019s all very overwhelming and I don\u2019t really post anything online ever (in my entire life I\u2019ve maybe posted a question on yahoo answers when I was 14 or something idk) but I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel so behind and like everything is always ending all the time and I\u2019m clawing at the edge of the cliff or treading water as fast as I can, when it would be a lot easier and a lot let of a hassle for me if I just let go.",

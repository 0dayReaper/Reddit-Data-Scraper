    "postText": "I\u2019m graduating next week and I\u2019m not even sure if my parents are coming. I\u2019m a first generation student so I\u2019m really excited to go to college, my mom is proud of me but we had a fight recently and I haven\u2019t talk to her in months. I love my mom but at this point I\u2019m not even sure. I came home today to find out there was another fight again and as the the oldest, I have to make sure my siblings are okay. I wish they didn\u2019t have to through what I did. I feel broken inside but my mom keeps me going in life. Honestly, my end goal is to be rich and give my mom the best care in the world. After that, I\u2019m gonna probably kill myself. Sorry I just needed to get this out cause I never cry, but today just broke me down. I wish I had someone I could rely on :(",

    "postText": "My penis is 3.5\" erect.\n\nIt feels totally emasculating. \n\nI have been dealing with these dysmorphic feelings since my teenage years. It gets exacerbated when I see a young couple with lovely relationship. Knowing the fact that I have already missed that period of life. Due to reasons that are not under the control of mine.\n\nI am aware of the fact that people are not created equally and are not meant to be. I know it's a minor disability compared to what some people have to go through. But it's hard to live like that. I assure you. I definetely do. \n\nMy life is totally based on jealousy and envy. I know that I'll never be the first option for anybody, ever.\n\nWhen you talk about these topics on online, people's clich\u00e9 answer would be like \"Use your tongue and fingers... Be confident... It does not matter at all... My sweety boy don't be harsh on yourself... There is somebody for everybody... so on and so forth\". But yeah, really? In real life small penis is a matter of comedy not sexuality.\n\nGiving up on these kinda of topics are hard. Your natural instincts induce you to think about your small penis, nature is based on sex. Society also contributes to it.\n\nLife is somewhat between boring and disgusting. I want to finish it with a quote from Rick and Morty:\n\n\"I've dwelt among the humans. Their entire culture is built around their penises. It's funny to say they are small. It's funny to say they are big. I've been at parties where humans held bottles, pencils, thermoses in front of themselves and called out, 'Hey, look at me. I'm Mr. So-and-So Dick. I've got such-as-such for a penis.' I never saw it fail to get a laugh.\"",

You could have that too but you need to stop seeing yourself as just a sexual tool and instead as a person that someone can live and have a relationship with. \n\nThere are many women that have a lot of discomfort from even an average sized penis due to a tilted uterus and so struggle to have sex too. \n\nStart looking for someone to love and stop fixating on your penis.",

I wouldn't change a thing about him even if he doesn't see it that way.

I\u2019m not attracted to my partner bc of dick size. It\u2019s their personality, looks, confidence, humor etc all the stuff you usually interact with before a dick ever comes into play. \n\nAlso there is so much more to sex than dick size and you are way more obsessed with it than most women, so it\u2019s sound more like you are living your on self-fulfilled prophecy on that account esp w/ the Rick n morty quote. \n\nMost women don\u2019t even orgasm from penetration alone, and if they do need have foreplay. Sex is not just penis in vagina. There\u2019s sex toys, using your fingers and mouth. SO many options and that\u2019s not even getting into kinks if that\u2019s something you\u2019re both into. It sucks that our society does often just value sex at the penis in vagina level and puts an emphasis on penis size and it\u2019s hard to see past this representation of straight sex if you don\u2019t have much experience with sex or get most of your knowledge from main stream porn. \n\nYou sound like you really need to work on your self confidence and personality before you should consider trying to date.",

I don't watch porn so I'm not biased in that way like many in our culture (maybe yourself included). Porn is not real life; it is extremes. Realistically, 3.5 inches is not what is considered a micropenis. I'm pretty sure that the clinical definition is much smaller. Lots of men have small penises and  at the same time have fulfilling lives and relationships. I remember I cared for an older man with a loving, doting wife and six grown adult children, a great family full of caring people, and it is was difficult to catch his urine because his penis was just a small bump. I only remember it because I remember thinking about how they had six kids (and countless grandkids). It really only matters if you make it matter or choose people in your life who have an issue with it. There are lots of women out there who value many other things as more importantly than the size of a penis.",

I didn\u2019t care either time. I liked the guy. Many women don\u2019t reach an orgasm from just penetration.

That\u2019s why people tell you to use your tongue and fingers. You could have a big dick but most women would never orgasm unless their clit is being stimulated either at the same time as the penetrating (hands/toys) or before/after the penetrating\n\nSure, there may be some people that care that you have a micropenis. Just like how there are people that care about any random part of another person\u2019s body. It doesn\u2019t mean that *you* are a problem.

He still would rather have a thicker penis, and while I don't particularly care as long as I'm enjoying myself, we decided to get a male equivalent to a strap-on and he loves using it on me. I don't care either way tbh. I prefer just him but being full also feels nice.\n\nThere are sex stores (online too) that sell strap-ons for men with smaller dicks. You can get one that's just a bit bigger or one that is really big or even huge. The first one we got was Huge and I HATED IT. I had never had anything that big in me before and it was so painful when he tried I made him throw it away. Now we have one that mostly adds girth and is only 1 inch longer in length and it's much better. \n\nThe male strap-ons are also super tight around the guy so it still feels really good for him too and you don't have to worry about a condom. There are ways around having a smaller size penis. You just have to put in the research.",

I believe you, and I understand that it causes you psychological pain and complicates personal relationships. Maybe something like radical acceptance would be good to practice (I have to accept that X, and that makes me feel Y -&gt; dont try to deny your feelings), or find support groups of men who also have micro penises, groups like that can really help.

            "comment": "I too have a small penis which has damaged my self esteem in past, but most of that comes from the way society shames and makes fun of people with small penises. Even a lot of people all about \u201cself love\u201d and claim to be anti body shaming are hypocritical and make a 180\u00b0 when it comes to small penises, laugh at small penis jokes or say them themselves. It\u2019s disgusting. The only people that should be ashamed are the people guilty of body shaming people with small penises.\n\nBut, it isn\u2019t all bad. There\u2019s still people that don\u2019t mind being with someone with a small penis and some that even prefer it. My ex-girlfriend was happy with my size and was even not comfortable with the idea of being with someone who has a bigger penis than mine. I even tried using a penis extender that makes it longer and thicker and she flat out denied it when she saw how big it was with the extender and told me to take it off. \n\nAs far as having confidence and self esteem, that is something you can build up. One way is to stop caring what other people think and though that\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s not impossible to do and something you can learn. Try meditation to help you get rid of ego. Getting rid of ego diminishes the possibility of having a small penis to hurt your ego. Something I\u2019ve even done is go to a nudist beach and get completely naked. You\u2019ll see people of all shapes and sizes there and most people won\u2019t care nor judge, which is another ego killer. It feels awkward at first, but after going a couple of times, you stop caring and it feel liberating. You don\u2019t have to go to a nudist place, but I do recommend it if there\u2019s a nudist beach/community/location close to you.",

There are lots of people who are fat, but we are mocked and rejected for our bodies. We are the butt of jokes, the subject of derision. We hear things like \"I'd date you if you were skinny\" and \"I'm not attracted to fat people\". Revealing our bodies to others is terrifying. I think I can understand a bit how you might feel. \n\nYou've got plenty of people here telling you that: \n\nA) women don't care anywhere near as much about penis size as men do. All those penis enlargement ads, the pornstars with massive dicks, the women in those videos who praise the giant penis, extra large condoms... are all thanks to men and their obsession with their pricks. Kinda strange imo, you'd think having a vital organ exposed and flopping around would make one more timid, but for some reason, men are so proud of this evolutionary oversight that it feeds directly into their egos. \n\nThat's the main issue here, is how your body effects your ego. \n\nBecause of that, there's a strong possibility that you'll read all of these responses and none of them will make a damn bit of difference to you. But I'd say that's really your foremost issue. A therapist who specializes in body dysmorphia can help you learn to accept and love your body. Then you can stop regarding your penis (something no one knows about you until you mention it or undress) as the be-all, end-all kryptonite to your relationships. \n\nAnother thing I was going to mention is that some women have shallow vaginas and really can't take more than 4 inches. So this notion that you'll never be able to please a woman is silly. \n\nTl;dr: your dick is fine, it's your ego/attitude that is potentially an issue.",

Never knew exactly how much, but he confided in me once. Thing is, Chuckie here is a married man and met his wife when we were both dickheads in college.\n\nSo I asked him \"Chuck, how the fuck?\" and the guy says this:\n\n\"I've been too self conscious about the whole thing. I met her and I managed to get her to bed and for better or worse I wanted to enjoy the experience as much as I could, because God only knows I know she isn't gonna pick up the phone when I call tomorrow because, let's face it, my dick's small. So I get her in bed and I do literally everything to rock this woman's world. Even when I came, I didn't stop for shit; round 2 became round 3 became round 4 and before we knew it, it's 2am and the room smelled like an Indonesian fish market in June. Did everything: ate her, picked her up, on her side, behind her, in front of her, under her, over her, on the floor, the table, the chair. Used my hands, mouth, my fucking nose, what remains of my dick. Everything. By the end of it she just fell asleep and so did I. Woke up the next day thinking I was alone but turns out she stayed. And we did it again. Point is though my peepee is below the curve, I didn't let that shit stop me. We started going out steady afterwards and the rest is history.\"\n\nI'm not saying you're gonna knock it out of the park from the very start or from the first girl.\n\nBut what I will say is that if there's a take away from Chuckie-boy here is that, shit, if you're gonna go down in the first round you might as well go down swinging like it was the heavyweight title match.\n\nOnce again, it sucks that you aren't well endowed. I get it. All guys get it, trust. But if you fuck like a madman, I doubt they'll even be thinking about size after you're done swinging her around like an umbrella caught in a cyclone.\n\nBelieve in yourself man.

I follow him on insta, he has a beautiful long term gf now. He upgraded haha. \n\nI found him attractive, but what was more important was how genuine of a person he was and how at ease I felt hanging out with him. Just be a good person and boyfriend, women don\u2019t care as much as you think they do about size. And if you can do great things with your tongue/hand then she\u2019ll be really impressed. Most guys are okay at sex and suck at foreplay\u2026 if your amazing with other methods you will knock her off her feet.",

People vary in their sexual needs as well as all other categories of a relationship. Not everyone dislikes small penis sizes, genuinely there is someone out there that will not care or will prefer the smaller size for their own reasons. It\u2019s all about self confidence and loving yourself as a single person before you can ever get into a healthy relationship.",

I had an orgasm every time through penetration without any help from me, which every other man has needed. Quit feeling sorry for yourself and just live. Life isn\u2019t all about sex. At least not for the normal people out here.",

It was too big, it was really uncomfortable during sex.",

It won't.\n\nHowever, if you wallow in something so insignificant and beat yourself up over it, you will also never find that one for you, because you're worrying about something so minute instead of being yourself and pleasing your partner by something other than sexual acts.\n\nDon't worry about your dick size, man. Continue to better yourself, and you'll find a girlfriend and a wife.\n\nWoman you are going to marry are going to be obsessed with your personality and interests, not that size of your brat...",

And when I did get it I assumed they were chubby chasers (which turns me off, I\u2019m a person, dig THAT) or just setting me up to humiliate me. \n\nI kept that shit to myself though. Until I met my hubby who was first my bestie. And is still my bestie. He wasn\u2019t into large women when he met me. He fell for me for ME. \n\nYou need to work on your outlook. Your dick may not be for everyone. And yeah, there are a lot of women out there who DO care about dick size. But most of us just want someone who\u2019s going to see US as people. Who want to build and grow with us. And of course, can make us fucking laugh. \n\nGet a personality. Stop focusing on your dick. And start trying to be more than a walking pair of trousers. \n\nNo, there\u2019s not someone for everyone. Plenty of people die alone and with no lover or romantic relationship. But you\u2019re not helping yourself by engaging in an endless pity party. And honestly, the only person willing to come to a pity party is the one throwing it. \n\nPeople are attracted to confidence too. So, work on being a person and not an organ and you might just find yourself becoming one of those happy people in a relationship.",

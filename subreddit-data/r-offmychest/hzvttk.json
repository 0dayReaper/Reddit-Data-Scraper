It's like she shared a piece of her world with me, and to me alone. I had to share this somewhere because I am bursting inside. I'm gonna learn ASL, so I can be a part of her world too.\n\nI'm falling in love with this girl.",

My co worker almost majored in ASL and my manager dated a guy that new ASL and she has an app on her phone to keep learning. Then I told my mother the story and she dated a dead guy when she was younger, so he tried teaching her ASL as well. I think it\u2019s important to learn ASL. So few people I feel like know it and working in the service industry, I think that people that speak ASL are really needed for people hard of hearing.  That\u2019s sooooo cute!!! Please learn it!!!",

I picked up on it after I was roomed up with two deaf peole at the dorms my first year of college (funny, you can't knock on the bathroom door to ask if someone is in there and they can't either; all privacy is lost).\n\nLights flicker throughout when someone is at the front door since they can't hear someone knocking.  And to wake up in the morning, the roommates had machines that beat their beds to death with the most annoying thuds any hearing person can hear at 6 in the morning.\n\nMet my wife while working at the speech and hearing clinic.  She was majoring in ASL (hearing person) to be an interpreter.\n\nToday we have kids that we have also taught.  Has worked great in not having to yell in public, whether far across aisles, or disciplining without making a scene.  Daughter has used it in cases as a cashier, saving customers from writing everything.\n\nToday with COVID19, they are at a huge loss with facemasks covering to where they cannot read lips.  So learning even basic ASL signs can lift a tremendous burden off of communication gaps with the Deaf community.",

    "postText": "I meet nearly everything with fear at how my actions reflect on me. I am and always have been a perfectionist, and it has made me terrified of failure in nearly every aspect of my life. When I make even a small mistake that I think may reflect on my ability or my character, I\u2019m filled with fear and horror and view it as evidence of me being a horrible, worthless, mess of a person. I don\u2019t want to live like this anymore, governed by fear about the kind of person I am instead of accepting where I\u2019ve made mistakes and working to correct them and be the kind of person I want yo be. I don\u2019t know where to begin, though, I\u2019ll start trying.",

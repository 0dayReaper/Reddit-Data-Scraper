    "postText": "I met my soulmate (f25) almost 2 years ago. On our first date I felt this spark and I so quickly felt comfortable around her. Very early in our first date she confessed she was a with a man \u201cL\u201d (25)\n\nHe proposed to her 3 months ago, when she told me, we planned on running away together. But just a month ago she found out she was pregnant, it was completely accidental. Both her and L\u2019s parents are very religious, so they planned the wedding as soon as they could.\n\nI was one of her bridesmaids, I looked at her as little as possible, and I left shortly after my speech at the reception.\n\nShe tried calling me a few times later last night, I didn\u2019t answer. I can\u2019t see or think about her anymore without breaking down. Don\u2019t hate me for this, but I feel very guilty for going behind L\u2019s back this whole time, for him and their kid, but I don\u2019t regret it.\n\nThank you for listening, I don\u2019t have anyone who knew about this and all my friends would hate me and her if I told them.",

    "postText": "This is just to get it off my chest cause keeping this to myself isn't doing me any justce. \n\nI feel like my illusion of the people around me is crumbling. My class (at sch) has always had drama going on but I never saw any of it, like ever. I'd hear people talk about it and call out/ bite at each other under the guise of a general address. I *know* they fight but I never actually *see* it. This year hasn't been any different. I still hear about these things but never actually see them. But this time, people keep pointing them out to me and it heavily distorts the image I had in my head.\n\nI knew I wasn't very observant but I didn't think it was to the point of plain obliviousness. People I trusted, people I held in such high regard...my friends are warning me against them. See, the thing is I associate well with majority of the class, but of course I have those I'm more familiar with. But overall I thought I had a mutual respect and acknowledgement type of relationship with them. But this last month alone I have been informed of so much that I oy started to notice now that it was pointed out and I hate how it feels like I can't quite trust the people I call \"good friends\", not my acquaintances.\n\nBut that aside, that's not really bothering me as much, it's this that weighs down my heart. I have these two friends. I've known both for ten years, but have oy actually been \"friends\" with one of then for five years.\n\nOne I consider my best friend...she does to, I'm sure of it (I'm not just trying to convince myself), but the thing is that we have lived and still live in two totally different worlds. If anything, the reason we met might be one of the few things we have that lie in the same plane. She went to sch in literally a different district, and now that she's doing her A Levels, it's still the same (same sch. I'm doing my last year of high school). Because she was (is) at an international school, we have different Calendars, so when she's on break, I have sch, and vice versa. So we never really get to hang out much, esp now that we're older. But what bother me is that we don't even talk much either. True, we're both not \"social media oriented\", plus, conversation flows mkre naturally in person for both of us but I'm willing to make the effort. \n\nI don't doubt for a second that she cares about me, but that's besides the point. I'd I'm so assured then talking to her shouldn't be an issue, but I don't even know how to bring it up! Because we'd only interact like once a week for 2 hrs at this point (at meetings/church), (ps, we hang out more as kids cause we had more free time) we've never really had any issues coming up between us. No fights, no arguments, we get along great and share similar thoughts on a vast majority of things (I know, I know, can a friendship really be genuine if you've never disagreed even once?), So bringing up an issue of feeling like things have gotten one sided is beyond awkward for me.\n\nNow, this other friend. Well, I had like the biggest crush on him forever ago \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude4c. That's actually how we went from \"acquaintances\" to \"friends\". I'd already known him for five years at this point (that was around 2019). I decided to tell him, not cause I wanted anything out of it, I've never been interesting in romantic relationships and dating, I really just needed it off my chest. So yeah, I told him and we just seemed to talk a lot more after that. We grew close with time, and when I asked where I stood with him (I needed to know we were on the same wave length) be said he considered me a \"close friend\" as did I which made me glad to have gotten the opportunity to know him better. But likewise, as we grew older we saw each other less. They both finished sch around the same time but her before him because like I said, she was at an international school so different school terms. She completed in around June, while him in Nov/Dec. He was a year ahead of me.\n\nHe's busy now, looking after his siblings, running errands but I feel like there's no way anyone would be too busy to fail to make an effort to just say hi.\n\nThis goes for both of them. I have the same problem with both of them. \n\nI love them both dearly. I've literally known them for 10 years now and their friendship- my friendship with them is really important to me. I've spoken to him about it once and he made an effort to make a change but everything went back to normal after a while.\n\nI ahte that I feel like I'm doing all the work to keep these friendships running, and if anyone else told me this, I'd tell them that they were worth more than to feel this way, that it wasn't worth putting in all the effort onesidedly but it's me, it's my feelings and taking my own advice is a rather bitter pill to swallow.\n\nI don't know what I want out of this. Whether it's advice, or a wake up call or just to have someone notice how I feel. But whatever it is, at least I've gotten it off my chest.",

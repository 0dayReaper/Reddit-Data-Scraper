    "postText": "This is very long but I honestly cannot stop crying and I just need to tell someone other than my fianc\u00e9. Also, English isn\u2019t my first language so I apologise in advance for any mistake and how it\u2019s written. \n\nMy mom would hit me (F22) and my sisters (27 and 30 now) a lot growing up. In our culture, it\u2019s normal to hit your kids (I don\u2019t agree with it at all, but just so you know).\n\nWhenever I got a bad grade, or didn\u2019t study enough, make a silly little mistake, she would take electrical cords and beat me with it, slap me, pull hardly my hair, spit on me\u2026 i was 6 when it started. I remember one time, she was strangling my sister (17 a the time) with a cord and I yelled at her to stop, she ran after me and slapped me so hard my cheeks were red for hours. My sisters were the one getting hit the most, especially my middle sister. I remember crying my eyes out every time when hearing them scream. As the years went by, it stopped gradually but she still was mentally abusive. She\u2019d call us stupid, dumb, idiots. She would say \u201c\u00a0you\u2019re so fucking dumb\u00a0\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re such an idiot\u00a0\u201d for such tiny things that I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell her anything anymore. I was walking around eggshells whenever I was talking to her. \n\nI moved out from my home country at 17 for college. Even with that, I wasn\u2019t looking forward at all when she came to visit because I was simply scared of her.\n\nMy father died while she was pregnant with me. She moved to my grandparents house when he died, which is a huge 5 stories house with one separate house as the last floor. My grandparents tried to intervene when we\u2019d get hit, even my aunts husband, but at some point they knew there was nothing they could do. \n\nI always saw her (and kind of still do) as a strong woman, because she raised us to be strong and ind\u00e9pendant women, did all her best so we can succeed in school (even thought it meant hitting us) etc. But she never showed any type of affection except when she needed it. I wouldn\u2019t describe her as cold, but she was just never in a good mood. I remember one time when I was around 12, I drew some graphic letters because I really liked doing so, I proudly showed it to her, she said \u201cis this related to school?\u201d I replied that I wasn\u2019t, and she told me that she wasn\u2019t interested in seeing it and to go study. I never tried to tell her about any of my hobbies after that. I didn\u2019t dare. She always always criticise every decision I make. \n\nI always made excuses for her, I still love her but today pushed me through the edge. I came back in my home country for the first time in 3 years (my mom would come and visit at least once or twice a year so I still saw her) to visit my grandparents. I\u2019m leaving tomorrow. I went to a spa, that my mom would go to regularly. I won\u2019t go into details, but because of me, the wrong woman took care of me (it was supposed to be a friend of her who worked at the spa). When the receptionist told me that I was in the wrong room, I apologised and didn\u2019t think much of it. I even apologised to my moms friend. When my mom picked me up, I told her and she went berserk. She started yelling that I\u2019m stupid, I\u2019m such a dumb idiot who cannot use her brain. I told her to stop, that I was leaving tomorrow and she shouldn\u2019t get that mad at a silly mistake I made. She replied that it didn\u2019t mean anything that I was leaving because I was still dumb, etc. I started crying (I\u2019m clinically depressed and she\u2019s aware of that lol, and thanks to her I start crying whenever someone gives me a lesson or slightly raises their voice at me). She said that I should keep crying because I deserve it. And she kept repeating that I was an idiot, along with some others insults. \n\nI had to pack my suitcase and kept crying, and I can\u2019t even enjoy my last day with my grandparents because I\u2019m so sad. I keep thinking of all the times she hit me or insult me. I was a literal child. I was 6. Getting hit with electric cords my her mother over a bad grade in mathematics. \n\nI honestly can\u2019t stop crying, all the memories came back to me and I don\u2019t know how to deal with it. I love her, she\u2019s my mom, she went through so much shit. But I can\u2019t deal with anymore of it. I still love her, I do, but my heart hurts so much right now. She\u2019s staying with me at the airport tomorrow since she has a flight right after mine, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll handle it. \n\nMy heart hurts so bad and I honestly cannot stop crying lol. I had to hide from my grandparents to my room and I\u2019m so embarrassed because I won\u2019t come back until August.",

My sisters take it lightly and always make up excuses for her, so I feel like my feelings aren\u2019t valid at all. Worst thing is that I love her and still care about her deeply, and I really don\u2019t want (and can\u2019t bring myself) to hate her",

    "postText": "I (16M) have watched porn ever since I was 11, and it was mainly on pornhub. However, I got the itch a year or so ago to watch more amateur content since I was tired of the professional stuff you'd find on the site. When I discoverd Adult GIF on 4chan, it was like a goldmine. I could watch short clips on whatever type of porn I was in the mood for in different discussion threads. There was a darker side to this forum, however, and it should have immediately turned me away from the site. There would be horrid, vile threads about murder, mutilation, and rape. I obviously steered clear of them as I wasn't sick in the head and stuck to purely porn I deemed okay. Something clicked in my head the other night however that I couldn't be sure what I was watching WAS okay. The other night while I was in a thread about public sex that someone said that it looked like the people in some of the videos were being raped, and none of the videos I viewed appeared that way to me, but how could I be sure? I went off the site after that, and contemplating it unzipped memories of earlier instances. There was an earlier instance where I viewed a clip which a person claimed that was child porn, and people asked them for proof, which none was given. Both of the parties involved in the video looked like adults to me, and people called this person a troll. I nontheless avoided the clip at that moment. Now, child porn is litterally like the one thing that gets policed and removed from the site, and when I saw this clip in later threads, I thought it was safe. But how do I know that the people aren't older teens? One of the moments I'm most ashamed of was two instances which in retrospect I realized had people being secretly filmed having sex. I was scrolling through otherwise innocent threads, or as innocent as porn gets, when I saw them. It only just the other night clicked with me the horrible nature of those two videos, where they were recorded and shared online without their consent and/or their knowledge. I have been using this website for a while and none of these issues had stuck with me until now and I feel an overbearing sickness and depression about this website I should have never engaged with. I tolerated potentially heinous posts on that website just so I could find clips I could jerk off to. I have been mulling over this for a while and have realized that most porn sites also have an issue where content like this can slip through without people's knowledge. Even with pornhub's verification system, I have heard that there have been videos of trafficked women still published there. I have vowed to never touch porn again and have been successful thus far, but I need to know, am I a horrible person for being on that terrible site for so long?\n\nEdit: Oh. My. God. I just remembered a time when I saw a video that I thought was just extreme roleplay which I found out was rape. I just remember thinking \"okay I got to avoid that from now on\" instead of leaving the site. What the hell was wrong with me?",

You're sensitive and full of empathy and care what happens to other people. You want to make the world better. We all do dark deeds, often with the best intentions, but don't spend too much time agonizing once you've figured it. Just follow the light.",

    "postText": "Growing up Mormon did serious damage to me and my psyche.  When I was younger the Mormon church pounded several beliefs into my head that have prevented me from moving forward in several aspects of my life. I am not sure but I believe I have some degree of religious trauma.\n\nGrowing up I was taught that sexual sin is almost equivalent to murdering someone, atleast in the eyes of God.  When I was around the age of twelve I viewed pornography for the first time.  I thought I was going to hell, that I was the worst person in existence.  I felt a tremendous amount of guilt, shame, and remorse. I am now twenty three years old and I continue to feel these feelings of shame and guilt.\nThe few attempts to explore my sexuality (hooking up, sexting, and watching pornography) I have always walked away feeling like I deserve some kind of punishment, that I deserve to hurt for my actions.  I no longer believe in Mormonism, and I not longer believe I am going to hell, but the shame is still there, taking other forms.\n\nAnother thing that happened to me was back in 2018.  I was in a relationship with a Mormon girl preparing to go on my LDS mission.  During the beginning of this year my cousin committed suicide, my girlfriend (who encouraged me to go on a mission) broke up with me for another guy, all my friends decided I was a lost cause and preparing for a mission was more important, and my family learned that my older cousin (one who was an inspiration for me to go on a mission) had been sexually abusing my sister for years.  The accumulation of all these things pushed me over the edge to leave the church, to no longer believe in a church where a God allows this all to happen, to abandon me and not everyone else.  The proceeding years I had no one in my life and spiraled with no one to help guide me.  Also during that time I saw less of my grandparents because my cousins actions forced us to avoid any family gathering my cousin was at.  During this time I saw my grandparents less and less.  We then lost my grandparents in 2020.  I have always regretted not spending more time with them and now have anxiety surrounding moving away from my own parents due to that.  However one good thing that happened during this time was I met some good college friends who helped me significantly through all this.\n\nThis all being said I am starting to realize how angry I am with how much this religion has taken from me.  My friends from highschool want nothing to do with me because I'm not Mormon.  My friends from college all got married young (which the church encourages) moved away and started families (they barely talk to me now).  My Mormon cousin raped my sister growing up and the church allowed him to go on a mission.  My sister came out as gay and church members have disowned and disrespected her.  Even after I left I am left with serious shame, anxiety, and guilt.  I am too afraid and full of shame to try sex, alcohol, coffee, drugs, or anything.  I am finding it hard to find anyone to relate to and any attempts to make friends results in people holding different values and not wanting anything to do with me.\n\nIt took a long time to realize this but this church has harmed me in many ways and I am left here trying to pick up the pieces and figure everything out by myself.  I don't know what to do or how to get over any of this.  I think posting here I would really love some advice, thoughts, or even friends to talk to.  I'm exhausted and need some kind of win or someone to be there for me, someone I know won't leave because of  church.  Anyways thanks for listening, it feels good to let this all out.",

            "comment": "It's hard when you feel constricted by something that you grew up with. You've witnessed a lot in your lifetime and now its time for you to unwind the PTSD from your mind. You don't deserve to hold in memories that will keep you in the past. People do not hold power over you. \n\nSecond, I personally believe in God, but I understand how religion can be a tricky thing for some people. Especially when we grew up around traumatic experiences that shaped our view of religion in general. When people allow bad things to happen inside of a holy temple. It's the people that are bad, not God. Those people that shamed you and the people around you whom were tortured for not following a specific belief are not doing anything within God's will. \n\nI strong recommend you help your mindset first. But I must say this, you are strong and powerful individual. You've been through hell but fire never burned your resilience. You will achieve great things in life and you deserve to be loved. Don't allow the past of what has happened determine your future. Keep moving forward and love yourself. No matter what.",

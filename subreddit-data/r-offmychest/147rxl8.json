    "postText": "I've never fantasized about killing my self more than today. I've figured out so many ways to end it all and it feels sick to me but also relieving, knowing i wouldn't have to worry about anything anymore. And the worst part is the reason i want to do it is to harm other people, mostly the ones close to me, because they are the ones who mostly caused all my issues and these thoughts. I know it's really awful to do that just to hurt others, but they are the cause and i want to get revenge, hurt them back in some way. I'm scared and disgusted of how i don't value my life at all and would only use it to hurt others. I've been hated my whole life by people who disguised as my friends, my family has been mentally and physically abusive (less on the physical but it has happened numerous times). I've been to therapists but no use. My family has said I'm \"overreacting\" when i told about my thoughts and intentions, and it just made things worse. (I didnt tell that i wanted to hurt them, because the result would've been scary)\nI'm so lost and a total mess and have been for some years now. I hate it.",

If you don\u2019t feel your family or old friends provide you with the love you need, you don\u2019t need to stay connected to them! Especially if they\u2019re bringing you down.\n\nYou are so much more than the sum of those relationships. You have so much more potential. You are deserving of happiness. If you can, please find a way to make a change in your life. Move somewhere new that can inspire you. Volunteer at a park or animal rescue. Find a tv show you like that has more seasons coming out that you\u2019ll have to wait for to see what happens next!\n\nThe world is full of possibilities. You\u2019re just one change away from a whole new life. There\u2019s more to explore.",

Cut them off from your life, move somewhere to look for a better future. One person who supports you is all you'll ever need. There is no better revenge then to show them you made yourself a successuful person without them. Work your way through it and laugh when they want you back. You'll know their true colors.\nI don't know your situation and I assume it seems impossible for you to turn your life around. But I believe you can do it. Wish you all the best!",

Fear is only natural because you know it\u2019s morally wrong, it shows that you still have a grip on yourself, don\u2019t let go of it. Get a change of environment for yourself, I was in a position like this too once and sometimes best way to get out of it is to find control somewhere, internally or externally. Don\u2019t do it to hurt others or use it as a solution, you can still make it their loss in plenty other ways that does not include suicide. I don\u2019t know how old you are or where you live but do try and find organizations that can help you, assuming you\u2019re an adult considering you\u2019ve tried therapy, hopefully you can find a new stable environment, OP. They do not define who you are, your emotions are just as valid as anyone else\u2019s after all, they are not to decide where your value is.",

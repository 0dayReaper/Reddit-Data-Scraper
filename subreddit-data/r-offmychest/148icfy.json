    "postText": "Why is it so difficult for the people I'm paying to work, to do an acceptable job? If you charge higher for your services, I expect a quality work, if you charge lower, I expect the bare minimum to be there. But I'm always surprised by mistakes that would've never crossed my mind to be possible.\n\nMy mother once told me that if I want something done well, I'd have to do it myself, and I fucking hate how much of it has been true so far. I love my job, but I can't possibly do all of it on my own. Yet if I want things to go forward, to be on schedule, to not have crass mistakes, I HAVE to do it all.\n\nToday was the last stretch, looking back I barely get to enjoy the parts I really like anymore, because I always have something to worry about and my productivity is sinking. I wish I could just throw everything away and become a hermit secluded from everything and everyone, or that a bolt of thunder would fall from the skies and strike me down before I let myself be fueled by hatred.",

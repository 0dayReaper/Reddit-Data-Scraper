    "postText": "We had a family cat, who was a stray originally, but she started to come to our yard to nap often, we started to feed her and some time after that she became completely a part of our family, she really liked cuddling and coming into the house to be with us.\n\nAfter three years, she died last september when something attacked her and unfortunately she didn\u2019t survive. \n\nLast night I had a dream, or maybe I have been semi-awaken when I felt like our cat jumped on me and laid down on my chest. When I woke up completely at first I didn\u2019t even realize that that was impossible. I\u2019m just crying since then. I really do miss her.",

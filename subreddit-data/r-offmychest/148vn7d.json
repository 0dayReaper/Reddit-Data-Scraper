    "postText": "I'm at a life stage where I choose my life partner. Being a 27-year-old Indian, it is a lot of pressure. Here is my story!\r  \n\r  \nI'm in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend of 5 years. Both of us are working abroad, and he is with me through all ups and downs in my life. Whenever we had problems, we time-resolved them. Its going great, as we have a mutual understanding and a lot of love - respect for each other.\r  \n\r  \nNow comes into the picture - the families!\r  \n\r  \nI have a single parent- my mom! I told her about my boyfriend, and she is okay with my choice as long as his family supports this relationship.\r  \n\r  \nMy boyfriend's family has a terrible reputation in society - his parents were separated during his childhood for 15 years, and his mom was having affairs. It's a very dysfunctional family, and people from my side are well aware of this situation. His family is full of drama, and they habitually overshare household problems with their family and friends. My boyfriend has been through this lifelong trauma.\r  \n\r  \nBut anyhow, they agreed to get us married in the first place. I have been talking to his mom for a year; she knows my existence! So we introduced both families, and there was an official meeting. My boyfriend and I went to India for this meetup and hoped to get engaged or become more official!\r  \n\r  \nBut his family avoided the whole discussion of getting us engaged right away. So it was just a meeting with no solid subject!\r  \n\r  \nNow his family is creating all the drama around how my boyfriend is not being a good son and choosing to marry a girl from a \u201clower\u201d caste. They are trying to pressure him to leave me. This rejection is quite hurtful, as I\u2019m an independent, well-earning woman. My whole future is secured, and there shouldn't be any problem, as he will not have to take my \u201cresponsibility.\u201d But they are trying to convince him to get married in his caste, and it's not making any sense.\r  \n\r  \nLucky me, he is not listening to them but is in a dilemma that something will go wrong if he marries me.\r  \n\r  \nAfter seeing this situation, my family believes I\u2019m better off with this drama. And I should look for an open-minded family and a better position. Because ultimately, his family won't be treating me right, and he will not take a tough stand against all of this.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m in the worst condition right now; I don't understand what should even be my take on this; I have invested so much in this relationship for five years. My family supports whatever I decide for myself, and they expect me to find an essential supportive family, and that's what I have always wanted.\r  \n\r  \nI love my boyfriend so much but can't take his family anymore. I have met them twice; they criticize me intensely. They even have a problem: I will take my mother\u2019s responsibility in her old age. But they expect their son to be taking care of them. I wouldn't say I like these hypocritical ideologies.\r  \n\r  \nMy boyfriend wants to marry me, and that's all he cares about. But I do care about other aspects too. I didn't get much family time after losing my father, so I wanted at least a functional family.\r  \n\r  \nI don't know what to do and cannot see what is good for me.\r  \n\r  \nI welcome your thoughts and experiences!",

    "postText": "Getting disrespected and making good money sucks. I make a nice paycheck but I also don't get appreciated for actually giving af about my job and showing up on time everyday. New guy starts working and soon realized he makes more money than I do even tho I've been there years longer. Keep in mind his first impression showing up Late almost all the time and tripping off drugs. Finding out this guy made more money than me was probably the biggest fuck you I've ever felt. Its an odd situation that idk how I'm gonna handle but for now I'm making good money. It just sucks to know ur working for a douchebag. Just wanna vent with people going through similar shit. Some jobs apparently don't give af if your good at what u do and are a respectable responsible human being at the same time.",

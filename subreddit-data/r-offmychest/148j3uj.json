    "postText": "Context: I\u2019m not married and have no kids of my own. I live with my SO and we are just happy to be currently where we are at the moment. It\u2019s become pretty much a daily thing this coworker makes a joke or says to me that I need to make my SO a stay at home spouse and have children. It\u2019s pretty annoying. I make good money for the first time in my life and I am able to enjoy a middle income lifestyle, but we as a couple don\u2019t make enough to afford children. Not to mention home prices in my area start around 350k. When I casually mention back that I couldn\u2019t afford a kid or a house (we rent a two bedroom apartment ,sub 1000sqft, $1400 a month) coworker gaslights how \u201ckids aren\u2019t even expensive\u201d, yet whenever I talk with my coworkers casually about a trip I have coming up or that I\u2019m playing sports later the ones with kids, including the one in question, are always saying \u201cmust be nice to have money\u201d or \u201cenjoy it while it lasts all gonna stop once you become a family man\u201d. Overall it\u2019s gross how people gaslight themselves and others into accepting tradition as the only form of happiness and how they feel the need to push that on other people. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that this coworker has Christian religious views and pushes those on people at work also. Not anti-Christian just saying it has altered my views more negatively about the faith.",

He needs to this k about who's gonna take care of his kids while they're away, and if they take 'en, gotta ma age them...\nHe's just reflecting his frustration on you.\n\nTell him to go to therapy ASAP",

He resents the fact that you are childless as an adult and have all the time, money and energy he doesn't because he has kids. \n\nWhen my husband and I decided to live child free, the comments I got were ridiculous.  I was told it's the only reason I'm on the planet,  my only purpose to be alive.  But when we mention going out of the country,  our going away for a week,  we get the whole \" must be nice,  rich guy\". \"Must be nice to have all the extras\". And all I say back is, we all get to make choices. I chose to travel and live for myself and my husband. \n\nAll the push to have children is also incredibly unnecessary.  I totally understand that some people grow up and all they want to be is a parent, and that's what they know they want to be.  But others dont actually know our understand fully what it is to be a successful parent. Kids come first. You don't anymore. And I've realized as we've gotten older that alot of these people having kids didn't actually know how hard being a parent is.  It's literally the hardest thing to do.  And if someone isn't interested in it or don't think they can do it, why have kids? Or why not take some parenting classes? Some child development courses? \n\nMy advice, get as informed as possible before you guys decide to have kids. Don't listen to the haters who are mad they walked into parenthood blind. Just get as educated as possible. You won't regret gaining knowledge. \n\nMeanwhile. Tell your coworker to shove it.",

I personally find it beautiful, though there are those who take advantage, and that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. But it\u2019s still so common that, in most countries, they wouldn\u2019t think twice about seeing three or four generations living in the same house. Before the Industrial Revolution, it was very much like that in America, too. \n\nAnd material things don\u2019t last, they degrade, decay, and can even lose value the moment you purchase it. So why would I take issue with helping someone, let alone my own parents? If that means I have less money to buy in to the materialism that our society pushes, that\u2019s just an added bonus!\n\nAnd I hope that my children, if I ever have any, will feel the same way.",

I had a child in high school and I've raised him he's an adult he's going off to college and starting his own life and that's it for me. I have absolutely no interest in ever being married and having more children I don't even think I want to move in with a significant other. \n\nThat doesn't mean I'm lonely, I've dated, I've been comfortable committing within my standards. I've had a 10-year relationship with someone who has the same ideals and future outlooks as me and we work together incredibly well. But it's just constantly obnoxious when things are going well, people are asking me when we're going to settle down and I'm like, we are settled down this is as settled as it's going to get. When something goes wrong and maybe I need to vent or get input from a friend or family member they tell me is this the kind of person you want to marry and settle down with, what's going to happen when you're married is this kind of behavior going to be something that will hurt your marriage. I don't see why that's even part of the discussion. Why would I base any of my decisions off of fictitious event and fictitious possible future family that I'm adamantly against having in my life. And these aren't strangers these are people who know and understand me. \n\nI just don't understand why everyone's default is thinking that marriage and children is some kind of logical next step in any kind of relationship, or why a relationship would seem doomed or in trouble if neither party is comfortable with that.",

I pity him but don't have patience for him either.\nIf he interrupts your work talk to the manager about it.\nIf you were female I feel like you could have a decent harrassment charge. But I think you might be male and while I still think you have a harrassment charge against cock head I don't think it would get a much traction. though pushing religion could be argued... This makes me sad but I'm also tired of having lawyers settle all our arguements.\n\nBe strong. I'm proud of you. Also thank you for beimg fiscally responsible, the other option is not fun. Also I apprecieate you not having kids for the sake of it being the \"normal\" thing. I do not understand how \"christians\" are ok with pumping the world full of kids but not beimg willing to actually assist with the financing of the kids.\n\nA positive way to deal with it is maybe tell him that you don't want to hear him tell you how to live your life he can complain to you about his life but if he keeps telling you to get married and have your SO be Stay At Home Parent.\n\nGoing to go back to being mean If he does not sign him up for marriage counseling and divorce counciling. Start with brochuers first about marriage counseling.  or tell his spouse about it. add his email to divorce lawyers promotions. Find a divorce lawyer and do something to have to pay for services then have the bill sent to his house, pay the bill and be upfront about who you are but just make a mistake on the mailing part. would be move if the envelop said divorce lawyers. You could just do that yourself as well just make up a law firm maybe Quiverfull divorce lawyers. (look up quiverfull).\nOr you could sign him up for adoption mailings. or anything like that.\n\nAnyway good luck. Kids are great but also assholes. It is best to know what the risks are rather than being pressured into doing something not right for you.",

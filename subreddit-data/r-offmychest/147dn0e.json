    "postText": "So I am not sure how many people followed this, but I do owe an update. Hopefully a final one.\n\nHe is out of the house and with his new girlfriend. He was supposed to be gone Thursday, but negotiated a deal where he would be gone tomorrow instead if he left the cats and didn't trash my house any more than he had or steal anything.\n\nWell, he took stupidly little things like cleaning products I ordered by opening my mail, different things like house scissors I bought and what not. It was extraordinarily petty.\n\nAnd then he stole this fancy handsoap I just had bought, which is something I actually really adore and like. \n\nMeanwhile, I had been in contact with his recent ex. Who told me how the night before he left he busted out her windows and covered all of her belongings in paint. \n\nSo I wasn't about to have that, and set his packed stuff outside of my back door. I sent 100 his way for a hotel so he couldnt whine saying I was making him homeless for a day either. My father and I let him load his stuff, and he cussed me out in the end calling me a stupid fat b word and insane, but none of it really bothered me since I felt happy to be free.\n\nPolice are watching the house and I had installed security cameras and an alarm system earlier today in case he tries anything else. The neighbors are alerted as well. I shouldn't have an update unless he goes beyond crazy, but I think he will just move on to his new life.",

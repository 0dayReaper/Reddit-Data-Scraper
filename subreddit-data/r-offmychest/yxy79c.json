    "postText": "My husband and I are 28. We have 3 kids. He\u2019s the only boyfriend I\u2019ve ever had. He\u2019s been with me since high school.\n\nHe\u2019s always had low self esteem. I do too, but not like he does. \n\nOne day, we got new phones, maybe 7 years ago, I found out I can read his texts. He can see mine too, but he didn\u2019t know about it. This happened for like another 2 years. For his birthday and Christmas I\u2019d snoop around his texts and see if theres something he was talking about that he wanted.\n\nOne day, around November I was being nosey to see what I can get him for Christmas. I was pregnant with our second child at the time.\nI saw he was texting someone something suspicious, saying \u201cwhere can we meet\u201d and I thought this was with another girl. I read them more and I found out he was buying drugs.\n\nMy husband and I don\u2019t even drink, so I freaked out. I wondered about how long this was going in for, if I even knew my own husband anymore. Turns out he was buying something that doesn\u2019t get you high, but kills you.\n\nI looked around everywhere. I tore our room apart and didn\u2019t find anything. I went through the search history and all his emails on his phone when he was asleep that night, and found o it he was making arrangements for a specific date 3 months after I was due. He was looking at life insurance, which we have had since I\u2019m a stay at home mom. He was even looking up how much t costs to be cremated. Once he got home, the first thing I did was sneak his phone and text that guy and say \u201cI\u2019m no longer interested, if someone else tells you otherwise it means someone else has my phone\u201d and deleted that guys number.\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to know I was snooping but the thought of my husband not being around tore me. I remember being sick to my stomach and bawling in our room just thinking of the idea of not having him around. I love him more than life in itself. I would die for him and not even have to think about it. My husband is my entire world.\n\nThat day on I made sure he knew that, even if it meant embarrassing myself. I started bringing him flowers at work almost everyday. When he would come through the door I would screech with excitement and give him a hug and a smooch and tell him I missed him so much and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him all day.\n\nWhen I was out with him how beautiful and handsome he is. When he was around my friends I\u2019d say \u201clook at my husband. He\u2019s so beautiful\u201d \nI\u2019d call him at work and ask how much longer until he\u2019s home. \n\nI got him to start going to therapy too.\n\nOne night I woke him up because I was freaking out and couldn\u2019t sleep. I told him I had a nightmare. I said I had a dream he passed away. He said \u201cwhy is that a bad thing?\u201d And I told him how he\u2019s my entire world and other than our son, and our other on the way, he\u2019s all I live for.\nHe said \u201cbut things would be better if I was out of your hair.\u201d And I said \u201cno they wouldn\u2019t. If you left me it would literally ruin my life.\u201d \nHe said \u201cnot if you\u2019re financially well off. You\u2019ll be much better off\u201d and I said \u201cI could have all the money in the world. It would mean nothing if I didn\u2019t have you. I\u2019d much rather be homeless but still have you as my husband than be filthy rich and you be gone.\u201d And he said \u201care you serious\u201d and I said \u201c100%. I\u2019d sleep under a bridge if it meant I still got to sleep next to you\u201d\n\n He said \u201cI didn\u2019t know you felt that way\u201d and I said \u201cI really do.\u201d I asked if I could go with him to therapy. He said yes.\n\nI told his therapist I think he has depression, and he admitted he might. He got a prescription, and it seemed to help him a whole lot.\n\nEven though it\u2019s been 5 years i still do all those nice things for him, like call him handsome and bring him flowers. I don\u2019t ever want him to second guess for a second that he\u2019s my sunshine.",

It was the worst thing to hear, anyways, he said that God revealed some things to him, and some things that he did wrong, and so he quit his job and we started living paycheck to paycheck, but then my mom decided she was done with the marriage, I guess there were too many problems happening and not being talked about and fixed with him being gone for 8-9 months, so all that to say/reaffirm, money is nothing compared to having a functional household that values relationships and loves one another",

OP claiming that she \u201cfixed\u201d her husband\u2019s mental health by buying him flowers is interesting to say the least.\n\nAlso, OP kept reading her partner\u2019s texts for TWO YEARS (without obvious cause for concern) because\u2026 she could? I know it saved his life in the end, but it really ain\u2019t kosher. OP was spying on her husband for 2 years because, according to her, she wanted to know what she should buy him at Christmas. Not cool.\n\nThere is so much more to unpack, but I really don\u2019t think is the sweet story people think it is.",

We\u2019re currently separated. This is one of the many reasons. I have a rare chronic illness. It causes pain, severe weight loss, nausea, etc. It\u2019s brutal physically, but that led to the mental pain and anguish. Thankfully a doctor recognized how long I had been battling it without mental health resources and referred me to a wonderful psychologist. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t enough. Because at home I was mostly bedridden from being under 90 lbs, in pain and unable to mentally cope with how my husband was just leaving our house in shambles. As if he\u2019d never cooked and cleaned before we met. I started withdrawing from everyone. Not taking visitors, calls or texts. My husband just ignored me sometimes. Not even asking if I was ok in the evening or if I needed food. Finally, my best friend since kindergarten kept calling and calling until I finally picked up and had a mental break down, telling her everything. Including my suicidal ideation. I had a whole plan and everything. She took action immediately. Called my husband and my mom.\n\nMy husband did nothing except pretend to be concerned and tell me lies that he had been worried and called my friend to try to get through to me. Total bs. My friend followed up and visited. She made sure I was seeing a psychiatrist who listened and cared. She checked up on me. Same with my mom. She was  up at my house in a flash and stayed two weeks. No judgment, just love. \n\nBut those never went away; not all the way. And my husband never admitted that his part was neglectful and uncaring. \n\nOn top of it all, he physically hurt me later, so when I started feeling better, I ran. Literally. It\u2019s been tough because he still won\u2019t admit to what he did and that\u2019s even more hurtful.",

That is really invasive and disrespectful of someone\u2019s privacy. I\u2019m amazed at the lack of anyone pointing this out. Usually people get chewed out for looking through a partners phone one time. She has made a habit out of it for years. What the fuck.",

And then feigning a nightmare about losing them to raise the topic instead. \n\nI'm not saying that's not true, sure, everyone has different ways of dealing with things. But if my own husband, who is my entire world, was setting things in motion like life insurance, cremation, and buying drugs from a stranger to actually commit suicide and I knew about it, I wouldn't give him another second to contemplate it because those seconds in a person's darkest moments can be absolutely everything if they're determined - it only takes a second.\n\nThere's a few things that struck me as odd, but I don't want to get preachy and know everyone deals with things differently. But, if it is true, this is a PSA to OP and everyone else out there who needs to hear it - learn to communicate with your partner effectively - in every sense of the word.",

(When you don't actively \"want\" to die but you're sure as hell not making any effort to do anything to prevent dying sooner rather than later.) Like others have says, the thoughts don't necessarily go away but with therapy and medication, they aren't badly intrusive. Instead of spiraling, I roll my eyes and shake my head at myself. Shaking head also works kinda like an etch-a-sketch, or at least that's how I think of it lol then my thoughts are on to the next thought. \n\n\nYou've done everything awesomely and perfectly right and you're really freaking awesome for how you handled a mental health crisis.

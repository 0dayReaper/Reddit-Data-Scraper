    "postText": "Throwaway and sorry for weird formatting, im on my phone. My (F24) partner (23M) have been together for about 5 months. He has undiagnosed, but apparent autism. He is sensitive to noises, has a very hard time controlling impulses, and can get obsessive about the way things are and how he thinks they should be done. \n\nThat being said, he is also very sweet, he has a good heart and he could never intentionally hurt a fly, spider, or any creature. Literally. He loves fixing and tinkering with things and he\u2019s the type of guy that when he\u2019s asked to repair something for his friends or grandparents, he does an above and beyond job. I feel very comfortable being myself around him, while I have social anxiety when it comes to others at times. \nBut something happened today though. Things. We are both into beach combing in the bay for fossils, i introduced it to him, and made plans yesterday to go today. That changed when we had a situation where we ended up rescuing a stray kitten, (he\u2019s fostering it for now, but we may have to look for another foster due to unrelated reasons but he\u2019s healthy and very cute) and decided on a dime to do something more local so we wouldn\u2019t be too far away from the kitty. So we decided to go to the aquarium.\n\nWe planned to take some edibles (we both partake and know our limits) and after we got in, not even 30 minutes in, he told me how the noise of the air condition was bothering him, and how they should\u2019ve gotten better guys with more HVAC experience to come and fix it, but then it soon escalated to him deciding that he would try to be the one to fix it, and he tried to ask one of the employees if he could fix it. they had to call guest services because he was being unreasonable. They even took his name and number out of courtesy. This entire time I was trying to talk him down and reassure him that there are people for for the job that could fix the problem, and they were trained professionals. He calmed down once they took his number, and after I said I wanted to go back home, and we walked out after being at the aquarium for 1 hour. I spent $100 and that was quite frustrating. It was very overwhelming for me, I didn\u2019t want authorities to be called on him or anything. \n\nOn the way back to the car He then impulsively asked if he could climb one of the shorter buildings, which I refused, once again because I didn\u2019t want anyone called on him. I was still overwhelmed. \n\nThen we come to our car in the parking garage and he doesn\u2019t want to leave. I didn\u2019t  want to leave him unattended because of previous behavior from earlier in the day, and by this point I was just on edge. We then come to the agreement that we can go up to the top of the parking garage. He walks and I follow him with my car, as I already paid off the garage ticket and had to double back around to get another ticket so I don\u2019t get towed or some shit. I park and the top of the garage leads to clearly labeled private property, a hotel or something, and is closed off. He\u2019s insistent that he wants to see the top and follows a car through the gates. I just did not know what to do at this point, I was trying to talk him out of it to come out, which he did. A guard came out and confronted him, which I had to apologize for his behavior again, and mentioned that it\u2019s private property. After the guard left he was talking about trying to find a way in, and I was at my wit\u2019s end. I firmly told him no, and I was crying because I was just so overwhelmed. He was so ok with potentially getting arrested because he could \u201cdeal with it later\u201d. We just stayed in the garage for another hour or so until we both calmed down, we talked about my great discomfort about everything that transpired. I still don\u2019t know if he understood. We then finally got in the car and went back to his house, where he said he said something along the lines of he was concerned I didn\u2019t want to go on adventures like this with him. Now I do go to some abandoned places and do my share of poking my nose in places, but I never do it in broad daylight or at the great expense of being a disturbance to anyone. \n\nI\u2019m at my own place now and I cried a lot on the way back, because I don\u2019t know if I can take him to places like that anymore. He has been great when it comes to outdoor locations and like the fossil beaches and other indoor locations like shops and malls, especially when he has his earplugs in. but this was just\u2026 something else. The first time id experienced any behavior like this, and god i hopes it\u2019s the last. I don\u2019t know if I can look at him the same again or go somewhere without worrying about this kind of behavior again. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m gonna make some ramen and watch Breaking Bad. I\u2019m just at the end of season 3 and things are getting spicy.",

    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m a 19 year old creative and I just feel like I\u2019m driving myself insane for no reason and would love a third party opinion on my perspective that differs from my interpersonal relationships. I am an aspiring fashion designer and an photographer who has plans of branching off into different creative fields as I gain more life experience and knowledge in relation to my down the line aspirations. I am not the type of person who lets shit like this get at me yo but I am feeling insecure and scared and pressured. Everyone in my life is supportive and loves my photography work and ideas, and I\u2019ve grown my skills and network at warp speed compared to people my age and I\u2019m getting more recognition then ever before but at the same time I feel shaky about it all. I\u2019m worried about the impacts of my work as well as my skill set, as much of what makes my work special to me and others are the intangible aspects the feel of my photography and designs and ideas but I feel like technically I don\u2019t match up. I mean I\u2019m working alongside pros and they get what I\u2019m doing and they get that I have a long way to go but I just want to get there and I\u2019m upset that I\u2019m not there and that I\u2019m not doing enough. I know I\u2019m going to be fine and I\u2019m not a quitter and I\u2019m going to work as hard and long as it takes to get to my goals but I just have days like today where I feel discouraged because I\u2019ll notice some shit I did wrong or didn\u2019t do at all; it weighs on me a lot. I feel like I\u2019m being vague here but it\u2019s really hard for me to accurately describe how I feel about this. Would love some life experience advice or just your perspective on what I\u2019m saying.",

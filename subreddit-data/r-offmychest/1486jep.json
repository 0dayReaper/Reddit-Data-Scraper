    "postText": "My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for over a year. We were friends for a while before that, where we ending up being best friends and saving each other from toxic relationships. He was and still is my best friend, but I can\u2019t help but miss how it used to be before we began dating. \n\nWe used to talk every night, sometimes until 3am before I had to go back to school. It wasn\u2019t brief talking, we never stopped talking for hours and hours. I miss that. I miss when we didn\u2019t know anything about each other. I miss when things were going on in our lives, things to busy us to the point where we come home with more interesting stories to tell each other. \n\nI miss how it felt when we started dating. How freeing it felt. I finally got affection from a man who wasn\u2019t wanting to harm me. It hasn\u2019t changed, thankfully. But those first few days of me being there, anxious out of my mind, will be the days I remember.\n\nWe don\u2019t really stay up talking super late anymore, if we do it\u2019s serious. I wish I could have those playful moments of us laughing together over the headset again. I miss it. I\u2019ve tried to have those moments with him but sometimes he doesn\u2019t respond with anything more than a \u201cyeah.\u201d What do I say? I wish I could make you laugh like I used to.\n\nWe aren\u2019t even in a bad spot, not like how it was before, but I wish sometimes that things didn\u2019t change. And we didn\u2019t know everything there is to know about each other, just to make the sparkle wear down slower.",

    "postText": "So im 23 today and still a virgin. Ive tried with multiple women but none of them have been willing to do anything once they see how little my dick is. Fully erect im the same size as a bic lighter. When im not at work im alone because i have no friends and my family doesn't really talk to me and they live a few states over so i cant just pop in. I spend alot of my time just thinking about my situation from a womens perspective and honestly i cant even be mad at them but that doesnt make this any easier. Why would they want to be in a relationship or even have sex when they know theres no way they'll be sexually satisfied. Im 23 and have 0 sexual experience. Ive never had a first kiss. My mom keeps asking when im going to give her grandkids because my brother and all my cousins already have kids. It hurts because I've always wanted kids and realistically im most likely never going to have them. Ive been asked why i don't just get extensions or surgery to fix it but there is no fix to it. Extensions wont take 2inchs of meat and turn it into 6 inches of meat. Im just so lonely. I spend alot of time contemplating suicide because i cant go on like this. I bought a gun today and ive been sitting in the car at home crying and looking at it. Idk if im trying to talk myself into it or out of it. Idk if heaven and hell are real but there's no way hell is worse than this.",

Well I really don\u2019t know what to tell you to make yourself feel better but you\u2019re young and still haven\u2019t met the right one. Stop thinking about how women would think of you. I also did not have a first kiss and sex until I was 24, I\u2019m Female btw, so you\u2019re not late. Did you try dating sites? Or even like going to meet up groups and hang out with random people? I did that when I felt lonely and made me feel better :)",

The size doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ve had some great sex with smaller dicks than yours, and I\u2019ve had terrible sex with larger ones. Just bide your time. Get some experience under your belt and you\u2019ll do just fine. And like mentioned above you don\u2019t need w big dick to get someone off. You have a mouth and hands that work just as well if not better. It\u2019s not worth killing yourself over. I\u2019m 26 I\u2019ve never been in a relationship, and trust me it\u2019s hard. But if you end it now you\u2019ll never get to experience those joys and feelings. Even if you feel as if you never will now being alive you have a chance. Being dead you have no chance. You\u2019ve got this.",

Sex isn\u2019t the focal point of a relationship, and there are other ways to pleasure someone without a penis. If a girl doesn\u2019t want you just because of your penis, that\u2019s on her. I understand how painful it can be and I understand why you feel this way, and I know it\u2019s not going to get easier but at some point you\u2019re gonna find someone who\u2019ll love you for who you are. Please, just hold on a little longer.",

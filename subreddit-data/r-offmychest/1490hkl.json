I say that to my mom and really like to avoid sand and she just doesn\u2019t get it. She feels like I\u2018m exaggerating and that it\u2019s stupid that I hate it so much. I get that people that like sand or just don\u2019t bother about it might not get it, but she is my mom! It\u2019s not as if I want her to hate sand too, just that she understands me. Why is that so hard?",

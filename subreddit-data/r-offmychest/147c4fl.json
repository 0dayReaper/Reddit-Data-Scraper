There is not such thing as \u201conly those who\u2026\u201d no, it\u2019s you. Just you. This is your life, and the universe knows it, it\u2019s waiting for you to realize that you are the dream maker, you are the life builder. Where you end up tomorrow, next week, one year from now, ten years from now is in your hands. They\u2019ll be people who won\u2019t believe in you, because they don\u2019t like exceptions. They\u2019ll put you down, because they don\u2019t want to question their own station in life. But that\u2019s not you. You are worth it, believe in yourself, don\u2019t second guess yourself. You will make it.",

I always thought that's where I'd land, I just loved creating so much. But as you get older and money becomes more of a problem, you drift away from those in order to just keep yourself alive. Well, lately, I have grown so unhappy with where I am in life. I am currently in healthcare and I honestly fucking hate it. It's filled with fraud and doctors who only want money and it just fuckin sucks. I want to be an artist. I want to realize my dream. And recently I have been leaning into that a lot more. I have been trying a lot more, really working to hone whatever skills I have. I can't take a life without creation anymore. \n\nBasically, this post spoke to me hardcore. I am taking this as a sign that I am on the right path. Thank you, kind internet stranger. I'm gonna doodle a thing now \u2764\ufe0f",

    "postText": "I live in a flat of 6 people (myself included). Usually, after the first year of university where I am from, students generally choose their flatmates themselves. One of my flatmates initially struggled to make friends but our group included him since we got along well. The dynamic was honestly amazing and I saw us being good friends in the long term. There was also physical attraction between us so we have hooked up (it became frequent when we started living together) but he made it clear from the start that nothing romantic will happen between us since I am not his type. As a result, I also never saw him as anything more than a close friend. I really enjoyed our dynamic as friends but something changed after the first semester of second year. He also ended up finding a group of friends outside of the flat and I am happy he did because he struggled with it initially. But sadly I think this made him get ahead of himself. \n\nI'm not sure why his behaviour towards me just changed. He is normal with the others but nowadays, he keeps taking jabs at me in front of everyone to the point where my flatmates notice and keep asking if I am doing okay whenever he leaves the common room. I will list some examples of this. One time me and my flatmate went clubbing and did not have a big group so we thought it is okay to dance with him and his friends (who seemed very welcoming). But after that night, he told me I should find my own group of people and that I need to gain self-respect since my dancing with his friends looked forced.\n\nWe also hook up with different people at clubs, but when I recently did it with my crush, he had mean things to say about that too. He said that I am too impulsive, settle for less and that his friends commented on this hook up by saying that I have downgraded and that \"my stock\" went down since people saw us. He then proceeds to tell me not to overthink this despite knowing that I will. I don't understand why he felt the need to bring it up when it is my decision who I choose to get with. We used to be very close and I have confided in him about my insecurities, self esteem, and strained relationship with my dad yet he made comments saying that girls with daddy issues tend to get around a lot. He used to be so caring and kept trying to help me but now he has done a complete 180. Another day he was talking about a friend of his that \"attracts\" problems and is exhausting to be around and then he suddenly points at me saying that I am like that too. It felt so insulting because this happened in front of all his friends and I just sat there unable to respond. This incident has been stopping me from sharing things with my friends now because I am just worried that I am exhausting to be around even though the rest of my flatmates reassured me that is not the case.\n\nI hate myself for having such a soft spot for him. When he was unwell, I brought him groceries and another day he asked me to buy Coke. I was stressed that day since exams were going on and I missed the Coke cans and instead bought Coke Zero. He ended up giving me such a hard time for that mistake by calling me names like \"idiot\" and \"moron\". The Coke Zero just ended up in the trash afterwards. I just walk on eggshells around him now because he has totally suppressed the fun side of my personality since I fear what he is going to say to me next. He has taken jabs at me for my lack of general knowledge, drinking and getting tipsy easily (when he drinks more), inserting himself into conversations with my other flatmates and judging me for laughing at certain things and the way I talk to my friends. It's insane how he only insults me yet wants to know what my conversations with others are about.\n\nIn terms of hooking up with him, it is less frequent now but I still sometimes find myself ending up in his room because I miss what we used to have so much and he is a comfort zone despite the way he has treats me. I know I am losing self-respect by going to him and need to start saying no. The worst part is that he told me not to have any expectations from him, not to follow him around in clubs and to make sure nobody knows about this (even though he has initiated things in public in the past). I have confronted him about his behaviour a few months ago but nothing changed.\n\nI just miss the dynamic we had and it hurts so much especially since I live with him and see him everyday. I am constantly reminded of the things he has said and as a person, I feel I am becoming less cheery and open with my literal best friends. They also dislike how much he has made me second-guess myself. For example, when he asked all of us for advice on something, I was too scared to reply since I keep fearing he will take jabs at me. It is overall a crappy situation and needed a place to vent.",

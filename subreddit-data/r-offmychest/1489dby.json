    "postText": "This is going to be a little bit of a rant, so I apologise if it's quite lengthy because I really need to get this off my chest to let off some steam.\n\nThis isn't the first time my friend made a mistake. The last time he did something wrong, he apologised. This time, it went out of hand.  \n\n\nYesterday, I asked a friend of mine (X) to help me run my Genshin Impact account for the day as I was not able to and had entrusted him with the duties to complete some tasks on the game. I thanked him for helping me to do so and got back to doing my work, to which he responded with \"No problem\".  \n\n\nSubsequently, after a while, he updated me on the completion of one of the tasks, and a long while after the second of the tasks was completed. I was wondering why it took him so long to get back to me until he told me a friend of mine (Y) in-game had reached out to ask for help with some tasks in co-op, and I was taken aback, mainly because he had checked my in-game messages and *even* replied to Y 'impersonating' me (initially).  \n\n\nI felt rather offended not because X helped Y, but because he didn't ask me permission for checking my in-game messages and *even* responded to my friend. I told him he should've asked me before checking my in-game messages to which he said it was 'pure instinct' for doing so and got very defensive and avoidant after I explained to him it was disrespectful and a breach of my own privacy. He just said he would finish up the last task and never log into my account again.  \n\n\nSo I just explained saying all he had to do is ask before checking my messages in-game and then he got really upset (or at least that's how it seems like to me from his tone in text), saying: \"bro chill, don't worry I won't login again\", like what? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seems like X does not understand what's the issue here, the issue is that he should've asked me permission before checking my texts, instead of outright doing so and replying to my friend without my permission. This ain't his account, it's mine, so I have the right to have my own privacy, right? What if a friend of mine had reached out to me regarding personal matters, would he have done the same?  \n\n\nBy being ignorant and defensive, X has made me feel really infuriated and even wonder if he truly respects me. If someone can't have the basic human decency to acknowledge that they did something wrong and apologise, then that person really makes me question if I really should maintain a friendship/relationship with them.  \n\n\nIf there is anything I can do about this, please let me know, thank you in advance for reading my post.",

    "postText": "I don't love my dad. He is extremely narcissistic and toxic. He believes his way is the best, always, and refuses to listen to other people's opinions. He has constantly hit me in the past, and whenever we disagree, he verbally abuses me, threatens to kick me out, and hurls at me derogatory names. He dismisses my pleas for him to seek mental help and refers to therapy as the \"crazy house.\" My mom, likely due to Stockholm syndrome, refuses to confront him. \n\nAlmost every time I return home - from my girlfriend's house, from vacation, etc. - I find my room in chaos: it's messy, my Legos are broken, and most recently, my beloved beta fish, Poseidon, is missing. I suspect my dad, who loves to control things, and had previously overfed my fish despite my specific instructions not to. He got mad when I told him\nHe\u2019s not allowed to feed him. He tells me I\u2019m wrong and you can never overfeed a fish or any animal. No animal will eat themselves to death.\n\nHe similarly mistreats our family dogs by feeding then harmful human food, like bones cooked with Scotch bonnet pepper and garlic, ignoring the vet's advice. I've even been gaslit with suggestions that I might have misplaced my fish when I have photo and video evidence proving otherwise. The loss of my pet has devastated me, and instead of empathy, my dad dismisses my grief with a laugh.\n\nThis disregard for my feelings led to our most recent fight. I was discussing my sadness over the loss of my fish and receiving a ticket for my car's window tints with my mom when my dad interjected with a smug, \"I told you so.\" His gloating infuriated me and I told him \u201cdad dad can you stop and be more empathetic I don\u2019t need that right now and what is I told you so going to do for me\u201d, and the argument escalated with him hurling abusive slurs at me and brandishing a bottle of liquor as this is nightly routine. \n\nThe physical and verbal abuse from him is not new - my mom, sister, and I have all suffered to the point of requiring hospitalization and police intervention. Our house is so notorious in the neighborhood that we've earned a negative reputation. \n\nAs a child, due to their fights, I was put into foster care for a summer, which which resulted in me getting molested , beat up, sleeping with roaches, and a slur of of things which affect me to this day.\n\nDespite being a successful 25-year-old with substantial savings and a $1m home loan approval, I'm called a \"loser\" because I still live at home. He mocks me for my student debt, despite his promise to pay it off, a promise he has since reneged on. He completely ignores the financial challenges of our times, comparing them to the relatively easier circumstances of his youth. Saying at my age he had a house (which isn\u2019t even true because he didn\u2019t get a house until he has 30) \n\nInstead of supporting me, my mom pleads with me to silence my objections, preferring to tiptoe around my father's volatility. But I can't just ignore his toxic behavior anymore. Despite my reasoned arguments he continues to insult me, threatening to kick me out. \n\nDuring our confrontation last night after things cooled off a lil (cooled off meaning I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna try to attack me), I listened to him, not interrupting his tirades. He told me that even if he said all those things to me he said that just means he cares. He said he wouldn\u2019t do that to a stranger in the street but would do that to me because he cares (which is obviously extremely toxic), and if I\u2019m offended by that I\u2019m too emotional and need to grow up because that\u2019s life and told me that I shouldn\u2019t speak and im lucky because if he would\u2019ve spoken back to his parents he would have gotten hit with a shoe or slap. He says i can\u2019t ever tell him anything and teach him anything because he\u2019s my father not the other way around,I didn\u2019t interrupt his rant. After he finishes I start saying everything I wanted to get off my chest . I tell him that it\u2019s invalidating to chalk up my feelings as \u201cbeing emotional\u201d I\u2019m like you literally verbally abused me and for what? I\u2019m sorry you were abused by your parents but just because you lived with that and normalized it doesn\u2019t mean i will.You have anger management issues and I recommend therapy. as soon as I start speaking he scoffs at me, turn on the basketball game, and doesn\u2019t give me eye contact. I said you go to the doctor for you body why not for the mind. He laughs at the things I say and interrupts me. He says then get the fuck out of my crazy house. When I ask him to stop interrupting and curing me bc I didn\u2019t do it to him, he doesn\u2019t listen and saying \u201ca conversation isn\u2019t you speak then I speak idk what twisted view you have\u201d and just keeps interrupting me. I tell him how me and my sister both have to go to therapy over all the things he did to us over that says and how when I see is face i constantly am reminded of his anger management issues and all the verbal and physical abuse he put us through. He sarcastically say \u201coh I feel so bad for y\u2019all\u201d then laughs (all while not even making eye contact) I told him that I wish I could have a father I could have a relationship with , one that I can\u2019t speak to like you don\u2019t know how badly I want that and I wish for that more than anything and he laughs and doesn\u2019t even pay attention..But when I express my feelings, he dismisses them as \"emotional,\" and my recommendations for therapy are met with scoffs and interruptions. He can't respect my perspective, nor can he accept the psychological and physical toll his actions have taken on me and my sister. \n\nHe's so dismissive that he sarcastically shrugs off my pain and laughs at my desire for a healthy father-son relationship. His nonchalance is so stark that he can continue as though nothing happened, watching a basketball game and laughing with my mom and guests just an hour after our fight. \n\nThe police have visited our house about 75 times for incidents like this, some more severe than others. These experiences have solidified my feelings towards him after 25 years of enduring his behavior. I have no love or feelings for him. I see him and feel nothing, and no longer consider him my father. I used to feel guilty for feeling this way, but",

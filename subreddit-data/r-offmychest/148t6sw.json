    "postText": "Venting about a few things. \n\n1. I have a married friend who has had multiple affairs. Her husband found out about one, and only one, this weekend. Our friend group has been telling her for a year to leave him, we have offered to let her stay at our homes, etc. She says she doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s going to leave him or not. I asked if the cheating will continue, and she said yes. I\u2019m freaking done with her. She is the epitome of a \u201cpick me\u201d girl. If we go to a bar after work and a man is giving me (a single woman) attention, she\u2019s walking over to make sure she gets the attention. Just the other day at work I was telling one of our (male) friends about something going on with me. She overheard, interrupted, and started telling her similar story. This week she began flirting with and snapping a guy I have a history with.  I\u2019m honestly not interested in him anymore, but it\u2019s the principle. She knows our history, she doesn\u2019t like that he still would like to be with me, so she\u2019s taken it upon herself to be the \u201cwinner.\u201d Again, it\u2019s the fact that she only wants his attention because his attention has been on me. Her husband hasn\u2019t been the best to her, but he doesn\u2019t deserve this. \n\n2. I have two children with two ex-husbands. My second ex-husband is still involved in my oldest child\u2019s life. Tonight he sent us a group text that my oldest child hit his (my ex\u2019s) girlfriend for taking a game away. I\u2019m embarassed, ashamed, and shocked that he would do this. He used to be such a good kid. It\u2019s been 18 months since my second ex and I split, and I would\u2019ve never expected this type of behavior from him. I\u2019m wondering if he needs therapy. \n\n3. I\u2019m exhausted and overwhelmed. I\u2019m, quite literally, either always at work or taking care of my kids. My job is a very high stress environment (critical care nursing), my manager isn\u2019t the best, and I never feel rested. I\u2019m having physical symptoms of stress. I have zero time to myself and while I\u2019m happy alone, sometimes I wish I had a partner to come home to and just talk. Last night I stayed with my best guy friend after work. We had sex, which definitely relieved some stress, and it was nice to have someone to hold me and just be there. He\u2019s not in a place to be in a relationship, as much as I wish he was, and I understand that. He did tell me yesterday that I don\u2019t take care of myself (when it comes to stress) and he\u2019s worried about me. I don\u2019t really have anyone to talk to about these things, other than him, but I don\u2019t want to overwhelm him either. \n\n4. I don\u2019t know how to manage my money. I\u2019ve joined some subreddits to try and learn more, and my friend is helping too. I just wish it were easier. I\u2019m in my early 30s and I feel like I\u2019ll never be able to buy a house, send my kids to college, etc. Staff nurses do not make the money that the general public thinks we do. \n\nYes, I\u2019ve gone to therapy. I took what was helpful and left it at that. It\u2019s easier (and free) to just vent on here rather than pay $100 for someone to listen. I\u2019m not looking for anyone to give me harsh advice, I mostly just wanted to let this all out. Thanks for listening.",

            "comment": "1. Cut that friend out. Feel zero guilt about it. \n2. Talk to your kid. Hear his side of the story. Do not act impulsively\u2014act to repair the relationship and trust and encourage him to do the same with his relationship with his father and the girlfriend. Focus on restoring a relationship as long as he isn\u2019t being abused by someone in that household. Something is brewing causing him to act uncharacteristically. \n3. Find a hobby that you enjoy that brings you some peace. Even if you can only do it 10 minutes a day at first, do it. Do something for yourself and don\u2019t feel guilty about it. \n4. While I don\u2019t love him for everything, reading Dave Ramsey\u2019s book \u201cTotal Money Makeover\u201d has made such a big impact on our finances. That program is a wonderful resource and you can probably get the book for free from the library. It will teach you how to budget and save. \n\nWishing you the best!",

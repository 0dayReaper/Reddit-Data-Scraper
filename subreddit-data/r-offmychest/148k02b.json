    "postText": "My father has never been a good dad, he never put me and older sister as priority and left my mom for another woman (I was 5 when he left) who had girls right around me and sisters ages. The step monster was never nice to us saw us as a financial burden and something to be tolerated. Dad had a baby with the step monster when I was 10. After that they separated and I didn\u2019t see the step monster or step sisters again for a long time this will come up again. I wasn\u2019t loss with them so it was fine. I only saw my dad ever other someone times only one weekend a month. \n\nOlder sister went NO contact with dad years ago. Because he was a crap dad and even crappier granddad. Myself and little bro went NO contact a year ago. My step sisters told my half brother they were raped and molested by our dad. Let that sink in\u2026 only reason they told brother Was because he had a baby girl and they wanted to protect her. \n\nWhat about me and my sister (no we were not touched) but the step monster left my dad and never filed reports or had him arrested! Why not? If it happened and I\u2019m struggling to believe it . If all of it happened why didn\u2019t they go to authorities or at the fucking least call my mom mail a letter and warn her about him. No they waited 20 something years. Now my brother is in shock his gf if pissed and so am I. And I don\u2019t even know if I believe them? I haven\u2019t been talked to about any of this. My brothers gf shared all the text conversations with me. I want to confront everyone and then again I want to cut them all off and never speak of them again. I have went no contact and blocked the step family and dad and all dads friends.  But fuck what a god damn shit show seriously. Oh and I haven\u2019t told my older sister should I ? The stress this is causing me is bad and my brother was so close to my dad has no one.",

            "comment": "People don't make these accusations lightly, and still a huge majority of sexual assaults and molestations are never reported - and it was even worse 20 years ago.\n\nI would absolutely assume they are telling the truth. \n\nFor whatever reason they or their mother didn't tell anyone before, but they sid now only when there came a new baby who could be at risk. He may not touch his own children, but there's no guarantee that grandchildren are off the table.\n\nI would follow their lead by telling everyone who needs to know for security reasons (if they are in contact with him or have kids, for example) so that they will never let him be around kids.",

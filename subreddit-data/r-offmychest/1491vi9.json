I\u2019ve never been in a relationship and I\u2019m starting to worry that something is wrong with me that keeps people from wanting me.\n\nI\u2019ve been told not to make marriage a goal, but I disagree. It\u2019s more important to me than money. I\u2019d rather be homeless with my wife than rich and lonely. I hate being lonely, not alone, but lonely.\n\nMe and my friend did make a pact that if we\u2019re both single by 30-35, we\u2019ll get married, but you know how those go.",

            "comment": "So marriage should not be a goal. It can be a want. It can be important. But when you treat marriage as a goal post to be reached you end up putting pressure on yourself and your relationships. You end up moving too fast and ignoring red flags. Your to be partner isn\u2019t some prize to be won, and not every relationship ends in anything close to marriage. When you put marriage on a pedestal like that you end up in a really bad spot, and end up feeling shitty every time it doesn\u2019t happen, and it wears on you. Teenage years are weird. I had like, two people interested in me in my school. And neither one of them were exactly a catch. The thing with dating in school, is those are often people you\u2019ve known for years, and it can be harder to find a romantic connection. Once I started doing clubs that took me to events and working I met a ton more people who inspired some mutual interest. There\u2019s probably nothing wrong with you, you just haven\u2019t met the right people.",

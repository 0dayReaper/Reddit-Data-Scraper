    "postText": "I\u2019m a piece of shit. I know it\u2019s wrong to keep this secret and I\u2019m doing it anyway. You might not think what I\u2019m doing is that bad and that what my mom does is none of mine or my dad\u2019s business, but it is. My mom is incapable of being on her own. She is bipolar and has schizophrenic episodes. My dad is basically her parent. So everything my mom does is my dad\u2019s business because my mom can be a danger to herself. And I haven\u2019t told my Dad this super big secret I found out. Thing is, when I found out, my mom flipped out, went on her knees and BEGGED me not to tell my father. She said that he told her once if she ever got addicted to anything again, he\u2019d kick her out of the house (this was before she got super mentally ill). She looked so scared and I took pity on her and promised I wouldn\u2019t tell him. And she promised she wasn\u2019t addicted, but I don\u2019t believe her. But I\u2019m not sure if I made the right decision. I know that no matter what choice I make, neither of my parents will EVER forgive me. If I tell my father, my mother will never ever forgive me and our relationship is strained enough as it is. And smoking might affect her bipolar, I don\u2019t really know. If I tell my Dad, he might kick her out of the house or at least their relationship will become worse than it already is and the mental health of all of us in this household will suffer. And he will also never forgive me for keeping this a secret. And he might not actually kick her out, especially since that now she is mentally incapable of being responsible for herself. I\u2019m between a rock and a hard place.",

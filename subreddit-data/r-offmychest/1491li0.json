    "postText": "in the second or third week of 2007 I was 17 and visiting my brother on March break  where he lived in a city several hours away from our hometown. \n\nMy brother was 20 and most of his friends were 20/21 except one guy, who I'll call J, who was closer to 25 than 20 but I don't know his age or name. (we're Canadian so legal drinking age is 19)\n\nMy first night there my brother and 2 of his close friends I was familiar with from back home came over to pregame for a club, one of them had fireball and encouraged me to have some &amp; celebrated when I did. I think I had a shot or two, idk, I wasn't a seasoned drinker &amp; fireball sucks.\n\nBro's friends leave and then he takes me to his older friends house to watch a movie (?) and drink beers and coolers. I dont recall drinking being on the agenda before going to visit my brother but...I was adaptable and painfully aware of my own awkwardness. and still in highschool drinking with college graduates. so. \n\nit was pretty late when the night starts winding down and I'm feeling fucked up, my brother is definitely fucked up because somewhere between when J puts his ferret back in her cage and his girlfriend &amp; roommate goes to bed my brother is passed the fuck out on the love seat while I'm laying on the couch.\n\nJ walks into the living room to, I think, grab some bottles from the coffee table to throw out and as he leaves the room he leans down and fully grabs my boob. whole hand on the whole boob with a little squeeze. \n just casual as you please, like he thought I was passed out like my brother was.\n\nI may have had the beginnings of a fever (that absolutely obliterated me the rest of the week) and had a cooler and 2 shots much earlier in the day but I was awake. and with how dark that room was I cant even convince myself it was an accident, he had to make a small detour to even reach me.\n\nand I believed for nearly a decade, if not longer, that this was not sexual assault. That sexual assault is always *violent*, i mean, it has *assault* in the name. this was also the 2000s so....this shit wasn't talked about like it is now. But it was sexual assault. of a minor. \n\nAnd I cant wrap my head around it.\n\nI think of it every couple years and I'm kind of like, oh yeah. that happened. and I dont often have any feelings about it. at the time I took it as a compliment on my appearance. I must be doing something right if this man would grab my breast while his girlfriend is an open door away, right? Just like it was \"flattering\" when my 60yo teacher looking down my shirt during class. And it was a testament to my nubile form that men would stare at my chest when shopping and my moms coworkers would tell me they thought I was much older because of my breast size. And no we can't give you a consult with a plastic surgeon for a breast reduction because you might regret it &amp; you should lose some weight anyway....\n\nthat was a detour. anyway.\n\nI told my mom when I got home that one of my brothers friends touched my boob while he thought I was asleep, likely said with no small amount of pride and she....didn't care at all? she seemed to dismiss it, though at this point she dismissed a lot of what I did or said to be me \"begging for attention\" including suicide attempts so like. not a great bastion of support.\n\nI told my brother once too, years later when we lived together while *i* went to college but I don't recall him having much of a reaction. its possible he didn't belieive me either, or maybe he just didn't want to think about it idk. \n\nidk. I'm just angry tonight. that no one grabbed me by the shoulders and said \"hey, that's really fucked up J did that. you know that right?\"\n\nbecause no, I did not know, and would not even think to equate it with sexual assault till 10 years later when i was beginning to come to terms with my cPTSD from childhood trauma shit.\n\n I still have to convince myself that yeah, it was a big deal. even writing that out feels over dramatic. like \"oh I didn't get hurt, so its whatever\" but I'm nearly twice the age i was when I happened and I still get angry and occasionally upset about it\n\nand if you've read this and thought \"well that's not so bad\" then with all due respect, get some goddamned help. Touching a teenager without asking for consent, and when **they cannot** consent is fucking disgusting.",

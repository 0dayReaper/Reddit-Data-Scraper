    "postText": "\nHey guys,\n\nNot even sure where to begin. Having intense feelings of guilt and fear that people will find out about my misconduct. Basically the last 4 years I\u2019ve been extremely addicted to my phone and particularly Snapchat, I add as many random girls as I can off instagram or tinder. I then start spamming them about my sexual fantasies etc. I have a submissive fetish, and enjoy being choked and smothered and dominated. I have even offered $$ just to be choked to random girls or friends. I have sent a lot of $$ to female friends/acquaintances as their \u201cpay pig\u201d and am afraid they will  eventually expose me. Very afraid my family or close friends will find out about this side of me and yet I can\u2019t seem to stop",

Also dipped my toes in FinDom, and there's nothing wrong with that either.\n\n\nYou like what you like, and you're hurting no one, as long as it's between two informed consenting adults. So get down with your bad self ;)",

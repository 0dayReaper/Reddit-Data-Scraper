    "postText": "There's so much I could say, but it doesn't matter.  No one has ever listened or cared. I have no one to turn to. I have no friends and my 'family' is the cause of my distress. I have an aunt and an uncle that I would feel comfortable talking to, if I was only absolutely guaranteed that they wouldn't turn around and tell the others. So here I am, letting my feelings and thoughts and the moments that no one else knows about out. As if this were a journal of some sort. I'm burnout by the ppl I live with.  Idek who they've become. Bigots. Disgusting individuals. The language, hatred, and ugliness they spew from their mouths...I can't take it anymore. But I'm stuck. Of course I am,  just my luck. I've come to realize, something I've known for a while but has especially effected me lately, that I've never had parents. Nope, never had anyone to teach me life skills. Never had anyone prepare me for all that life entails. I feel trapped here. I don't know the first thing about how I can get out of here. Out of this hell hole. I act like everything's fine. I laugh, I smile, and for the most part it's true, because I try my hardest to be happy and find joy in things. But it's always kicked, stomped on, and dirtied by them. But what they say. By their constant negativity. I don't wanna be this person. I wanna be me.  I know I am a beautiful soul and I can be happy and there is a side of me that no one knows about but I'm dying to share. And I can't. Not with them. And I have nobody else...so, no one knows me. No one knows the real me.  No one knows the improvements I have made, the work I have done.  No one on this earth knows me....\nWhy am I here? What's the point? How long will I have to endure this suffering and torture? This mental anguish. This agony. When will it get better? There's so much more I could share, but it doesn't matter. No one listens, no one cares. They never have and I am inclined to think that they never will.",

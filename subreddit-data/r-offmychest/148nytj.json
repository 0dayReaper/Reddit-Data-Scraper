    "postText": "We\u2019ve been friends for about 8 years. We met as freshmen in college. We were even roommates for 3 years and we studied abroad together. We\u2019ve been through so much together that\u2019s why it\u2019s so shocking she would ghost me. Since graduating we both went our separate ways she moved to a different state while I stayed still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life but we still kept in touch. I even went on vacation with her and her sister this year to a foreign country. \n\nThis is where some trouble happened. Like I said, I\u2019m still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life and it as always been my dream to teach English abroad. We were talking about this while we were at a bar and we were all a bit tipsy. She and her sister were basically saying it\u2019s not a good idea to teach abroad because you\u2019ll have nothing to show for it when you decide to move back. But I\u2019m stubborn and it\u2019s always been my dream so I said I would figure it out whenever I decided to move back. Then they just started to bombard me with \u201cwhat ifs\u201d and I was a bit tipsy so I said something I shouldn\u2019t had. I didn\u2019t think it was that bad but I guess it really offended them. I had a bit of a panic attack once I realized they were mad at me because I hate making people mad and I considered them as sisters I never had so I definitely didn\u2019t want to make them mad. I know it\u2019s bad but I just shut down and cried the rest of the night. \n\nThe next day I tried to apologize but they were still upset so I just tried to keep my distance and just go with the flow of the situation. Eventually we were back to talking and having fun and enjoyed the rest of our trip. Or so I thought. We talked a few times over text since the trip but not much. Maybe a month later I reached out to my friend trying to see when she was free for us to be able to catch up, no response. I reached out again 2 weeks later again no response. I reached out a third time to make sure everything was okay, no response again. I know she\u2019s okay though because I can see when she is active on discord. \n\nI didn\u2019t know one bad night could ruin a 8 year friendship. I\u2019m trying to be okay with it. I\u2019m trying to tell myself if she just ghosted you like that then she wasn\u2019t a real friend to begin with. I\u2019m trying to be happy that the universe showed me she wasn\u2019t a good friend in the first place and good riddance with her. I\u2019m trying to keep myself busy so I don\u2019t think about it. But in actuality it hurts. It hurts really bad. I feel rejected and alone. And even though I try not to, I can\u2019t help but to cry sometimes. I feel like such a baby.",

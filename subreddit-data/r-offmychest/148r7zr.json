    "postText": "I work at a walmart.   By noon we were pulling everything on the floor to put it on a reefer truck.  i work in the deli and when I came back from lunch just before noon, I headed for the deli to clean.  We only had one closer and I didn't want him to get stuck cleaning AND restocking the store when the power came back on.  \nEvidently, I am an AH for thinking about my 1 and only closer for the night and making his job a little easier.  \n\nEven though as soon as I was done I went out and helped pulled two walls.",

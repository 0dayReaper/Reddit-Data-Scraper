    "postText": "I F(32) am seeing M(32) for about 7 months. During the first few months we hit it off, we started hanging out every week &amp; went on a few dates. During some of those dates he would make comments about \u201cmy body\u201d. I work out consistently but due to having a kid my body isn\u2019t the same. He\u2019s made comments such as \u201c you work out and what\u2019s this\u201d while grabbing my stomach. Or saying \u201cwhy you wearing that? Untuck your shirt you look, nvm I\u2019ll keep my comments to myself\u201d \u201c get your pancake ass off the seat\u201d or \u201cyou have small boobs mine are bigger than yours\u201d while laughing. when he sees those comments are hurtful to me or my demeanor changes he says things like \u201cyou in your feelings now? Well I don\u2019t care you too emotional\u201d we had a talk about this and he says he says it jokingly and that if I loved myself it wouldn\u2019t bother me. He mentioned having a fight with his ex with whom he has to stay in contact since they have a kid together. After that fight he changed completely. The dates stopped, the talks about his ex became an everyday thing, at times he would reminisce certain moments with her and always brings her up into our daily conversations. I\u2019ve seen him annoyed when I\u2019m around him and I\u2019ve voiced my feelings only to be shut down by them and then later told how much he did for his ex how she was super emotional and would let her vent but when I would say something I would feel he\u2019d shut me down saying you being emotional we don\u2019t do that. I brought it up to him when we barely seen each other because of his work schedule. Since we see each other every week I was expecting to see him and he then said \u201cour schedules don\u2019t align anymore when you get off work at 2pm I\u2019ll be sleeping and honestly I rather do that\u201d meaning we won\u2019t see each other. I didn\u2019t say anything but then he called me the next day saying come by today to which I said ok I\u2019ll swing by in a bit and he responded with \u201cwoah woah later tonight not in a bit I have things to do.\u201d I took that as he\u2019s going to do stuff and then let me know once he\u2019s done I\u2019ve always been on his time, we hang out when he can, I usually move tasks around to be able to fit him into my schedule and I\u2019m always the one going to him. I do the things I have to do and by this time it\u2019s pretty late he calls and sounds upset that I didn\u2019t go see him and I said you didn\u2019t call to which he said we talked about this already idk why I need to call you. I feel that if you are busy and have other things to do why should I force myself to be there when there\u2019s been excuses made since yesterday. Although he says he \u201clikes\u201d me a lot his actions prove otherwise. Am I overthinking this? Am I making things up in my head as far as how everything he says sounds He constantly tells me I take everything too personal and now I\u2019m doubting my gut feelings. I was looking forward to a possible relationship with him but he\u2019s made comments of he won\u2019t do certain stuff for a woman because he already did them for his ex. Am I really making these things up in my head as he says?",

    "postText": "i dont know where to begin with this. (15F)\n\nmy parents marriage is falling apart, they hardly even love each other but i have no idea of what happened today because yesterday everything was fine.\n\nThe morning started off hectic already, neither my mother or father ever went to sleep the night before, my father has been awake for four days straight because hes an alcoholic, he drinks without sleeping or eating. My mother on the other hand, im unsure of the reason of why she never slept. They had a great night together yesterday, my father planned a surprise for my mothers bath and prepares it with rose petals; she was ecstatic. They had a nice night, i left to my room around 2am once i finished speaking with her and wished her good night. This is where everything went wrong i guess. Went asleep around 4am, woke up peacefully at 11am, i didnt attend school. Around 12 to 1pm, was the time they began to argue, first it was just irritating loud sounds, then it became serious about 2:30pm. They were in screaming matches back and forth, yelling right next to my crying baby brother, hes only 5 months, Jesus Christ he cant even sit yet. We'll call him \"NY.\" i have no idea what they were thinking but i stood in my room the entire time because im not good around conflict, last time a katana was swung near our heads because i didnt want to hug him after a large fight we had, the whole night. But thats besides the point, yet another full day argument between my mother and father, whats new? This time with NY around, a baby, they kept yelling, NY was crying, and my dad was throwing and breaking things. This is when my grandmother came out of her room, screaming at the both of them to calm down. She picks up NY and gets him safely away from this horrible situation, calms him down and puts him to sleep while shes stands there on guard, trying to talk to my mother and father, being a mediator to the both of them. The noise only toned down for a bit before it rose up later again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2:50pm: My sibling (10M), lets call him \"CJ,\" was waiting at his school, to be picked up like any normal day, completely unaware of what was happening. He attends after school but he hates it so hes always picked up early. Mind you, today my mother had been called in to work, at 3:30pm. So on days like this, she'd rely on my father getting him, Today since this argument occurred, he acted extremely petty and stormed out the house, yelling to my mother that hes not getting him. I finally exit my room since my father has now left to go comfort my mother and i see her, sitting in the bathroom crying, at complete disbelief at what was happening right now and how he was acting. My father then comes back home, looking for his phone, and what do you know? its in the bathroom, which causes another argument before my mother says that shes just going to get my sibling from school, but then my father all of sudden changes his mind and wants to get him too, so i dont know what he did, but he must've ran to go get CJ, and as they're almost home, my mother appears behind my father which causes another amazing argument, yay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3:20pm: My lovely father calls me, sobbing disgustingly to me and is demanding me to go outside and get CJ and my mother because my mother didnt want to go home. Which i understood that since she didnt want to bring the fight home to my sleeping baby brother, NY and my grandmother who is sorta disabled. But come on, lets just let CJ stand there and cry while he watches the both of them argue, again. Hes 10 years old, why the fuck are you letting him see you two petty adults argue? He shoudnt be 10 years old and already telling me that he feels stressed out and sad all the time, hes a kid. Hes not supposed to feel like this, he should be having fun with his parents, not worrying if one of them is gonna unexpectedly murder one another and then themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3:30pm: i rushed out the house with the closet clothing item i can find, grabbed my phone, money and charger and left NY and my grandmother at the house, for her to take of for the time being since babies cant be left alone. I kept calling my mother, didnt pick up, so i called my older sibling, (18F) panicking not knowing what to do, how should i feel because they've always had big fights like this, but this was the first time i was alone, with nobody siblings around since they went to school. I speak to her but shes not much of a helpful person, we dont have the most nurturing relationship now. I just inform of her whats going on, and she says i guess shes not coming home and asks me to let her know when this all dies down, i had to hang up since my father started calling me. Called right as i see him across the street, I rush up to father first since hes the one who called out my name across the street, my lovely mother didnt want to answer none of my calls or texts, because yk, make it harder for me to find you and CJ? Thank you so much, you fucking imbecile. Waiting for the cars to pass, i cross the street and the first thing i asked is where is my mother? Cause she was with CJ and she wasnt responding to my calls and texts, he then points down the block, where my mom is standing crying, while CJ is there just standing and breaking down in tears as he ran up to me for a hug. My FATHER supposedly walks away, saying hes leaving forever, how he loves us, and for me to take CJ and my mother home. I talk with my mother for a little as she vents to me about what has been happening and says shes not coming home yet as last time, there was a big fight home, cops came and arrested my dad as he went to the hospital for having a seizure, only for a cps case to open and become an ongoing active case.\n\n3:40pm: my mother says to take CJ home but shes not coming, i understand as i cared more about him since he was my little brother, my mother is a grown woman, she can take care of herself as i take care of her kids. i tell my mother to be safe as i walk with CJ home. I try to cheer him up, asking him if he wants anything from the store and if he wanted to go to the park. He said hes not hungry but he still wanted a drink and didnt mind going to the park. Im at the store, panicking now because my father calls me. Wtf, he goes on and on about how i left my mother alone and didnt take her home, that im fucking stupid and thats my mother, dont i care about her????Of course i do, i say. But she isnt my responsibility, my priotity one was getting CJ home, happy and safe. He then goes on to say how hes gonna come and take NY, AWAY. Since hes a baby and cant speak, cant think, and thats his son, so he can mold him into loving him since he claims his whole family hates him. i almost started crying before he hangs up, panicked i quickly buy whatever i was going to, and run home, telling my brother he sadly cannot go to the park anymore. The door was unlocked and i didnt want him to hurt NY. I got home safely and locked both locks on the door and inform my grandmother of what he claimed he was going to do, along with my mother. Who, by the way, was still ignoring my messages.\n\nAfter a while of this, i finally found peace at home, played some video games with CJ to calm him down while NY was still sleeping in his play area, occasionally awaking. My father constantly called me and my grandmother, i always answered because i felt like if i didnt, he'd take it the wrong way or would do something to my mother, who were still arguing btw. After the whole day of being outside, around 10pm, my mother decides to come home, along with my dad, first just telling him to grab his stuff and leave, like last time she said this, he never left and stood with us while a cps case was open, he wasnt allowed to be at our home otherwise, we'd get taken away. And our mother never did anything to us that was bad, just dated a bad man for 15+ years. My father, victimizes himself now, like the narcissist he is. Saying he just came to get his stuff and will now be homeless thanks to my mom. Even though, its clearly his fault, he says he didnt do anything wrong and that my mother is acting like a psychopath.\n\nI have to cut this short, as they began arguing again, maybe he'll finally kill us all and go through with his words for once in his goddamn life. I would rather he not kill all of us, so if he had to be someone, i rather it be me so i can self-sacrifice. He loves me the most, so once he kills me, my mommy can call the cops on my dad, and he can either rot in prison or kill himself. Lets see how the rest of this plays out for the night. i honestly dont know how to deal with anymore.",

He is more likely to kill you now, then at any other point. Go straight to the police. If you have recordings or texts show them that. You call right now while they are arguing. I don\u2019t give a shit what your family thinks, you need to call the police",

    "postText": "They tell me they care about me but all they do is the exact opposite of what I ask from them. I feel like everything they do is just an act to make me more miserable. I have chronic pain so it's hard to get things done on my own. I have different personal trauma from both my mother and father. I have nightmares of them almost every night. I just cut myself for the first time and I'm breaking down there is nowhere else to turn, nowhere else to go. Im just shaking and in disbelief that my life turned this way.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019ve been on here before and talked about how my parents recently got divorced. I\u2019m a teenager and thought I wouldn\u2019t take it that hard with their divorce since they have been toxic for eachother for so long so I guess I\u2019m used to that. Recently my mom has been forming a serious relationship with a guy she just met a month ago and everything she said she wasn\u2019t gonna be she\u2019s doing which is crazy to me like love really does make you blind but I\u2019d expect a 41 year old women to be more mature about it? I love my mother and I want her to be happy but this guy has her delusional even when I\u2019m with her she\u2019s not there because she is constantly on the phone giggling laughing and even driving she\u2019s messaging him and I have to be aware that we don\u2019t fucking crash. Before meeting this guy she made concert plans with her friends and now she\u2019s telling me she\u2019s not going unless her new date goes along or she\u2019s gonna sell her ticket because she\u2019s a relationship type of person and can\u2019t go without a partner LIKE WHAT seeing my mom go from independent to completely reliant on a guy she just met a month ago is insane to me. My mother was in a relationship with my father for a long time and this guy one month in already asked if she was going to move in with him. Keep in mind this guy has his own house so my mom is constantly leaving everyday to go hangout with him and now she\u2019s calling his house her second home. I\u2019m not gonna lie I actually got so sad about my mom no longer spending time with us that I bawled infront of her like that cry where you cant even talk because your crying wont let you and she told me it wasn\u2019t that serious. I guess I\u2019m used to my mom not really understanding me but it hurts that she won\u2019t understand where I\u2019m coming from and how much I love and see her as my inspiration in life. Also we have this trip coming up and she invited this guy aswell like why? Thank god he said no but why would she do that if even the guy is uncomfortable around us and when he met our entire family. She\u2019s being delusional as fuck and the guy trapped her when she was in a vulnerable stage and now she\u2019s \u201cin love\u201d with him even though she told me he\u2019s not his type. I say vulnerable stage because when she found out my dad was with a new women she went absolute insane and felt like she needed a partner so when this guy showed up and asked for her number she literally got sucked in. The guys also already asked her to delete photos of my dad? Like what my dad was in the picture for so long especially family photos. I\u2019ve also done my own investigating on this guy and I feel like he is lying about his story. He said he was in a relationship of 5 years yet he told my mom he has not one single photo of his ex when she asked him to show her a photo ? I don\u2019t know i guess im concerned my mom is turning into an immature person now with this new guy and I feel in my stomach something bad is going to happen and I can\u2019t get it out. I know this may sound dramatic but this is a get off my chest chat LOL. Another thing that bugs me about this guy is he is so PDA like with my dad he never was that affectionate with my mom out in public and to see someone she just met so touchy is so awkward and weird idk it\u2019s weird to me because this is her first \u201crelationship \u201c after divorcing with my dad so I\u2019m experiencing a whole new shift and my mom knows it to sometimes because she spirals back into reality and feels weird about everything then she goes back to a teenager in love. Also back to the guy my mom is dating he is constantly telling her if she doesn\u2019t want to be with him to let him know and then gaslights her to stay and buys her a bunch of gifts to make her happy. He keeps telling her he\u2019s scared she\u2019ll go back to my dad and everytime he has a flare up and gives attitude to my mom the following day he starts gifting her things and gaslighting her so she won\u2019t leave him. So I guess I could say I don\u2019t like him very much I only met him 2 times and everytime he\u2019s giving me a bad vibe like he comes in with an angry face then makes up an excuse to my mom that something happened. Like okay what\u2019s gonna be the next excuse. Alright that\u2019s all please give me advice because I feel sick to my stomach LOL",

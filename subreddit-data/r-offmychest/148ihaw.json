    "postText": "This week I've finally reached month 5 of sobriety. It's not crazy long, but I've made it farther than I ever thought possible when I was still abusing substances. I'm recovering from alcohol and drugs. Even though it's been a few months, I feel like I just now have been able to start thinking clearly. My memory has gotten better. It's easier for me to think clearly without losing track of my thoughts or getting distracted. I am slowly starting to fix my sleep cycle and I've lost about 30 pounds. My family and friends have mentioned that I seem happier and more energetic than I used to be and that I smile more often. I've gotten my depression, PTSD, and anxiety back under control. I'm regularly attending therapy. I'm slowly getting back into the hobbies that I used to love doing. Some things will still take time to fix, but I've made progress.\r  \n\r  \nIt's weird because I thought that I would never be able to get better. That I wouldn't be able to stop using unless I died and part of me wanted to. I guess it's just shocking to think back to how hopeless I thought everything was and here I am. I'm not dead and I'm making the steps that I thought were impossible.\r  \n\r  \nAnyways, thanks to anyone who tuned into my post. I don't normally feel much pride in myself and I just needed to get this out since I don't have many people to share this with currently.",

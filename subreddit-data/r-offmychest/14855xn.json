    "postText": "My son has been seeing a therapist for about a year now for some feeding difficulties. He was born with laryngomalacia and has struggled with feeding pretty badly. I do feel like my husband and I have hit a \u201c wall\u201d with him eating and we are running into some sensory issues- textures/gagging/ etc. today during our appointment she insisted that our son must be autistic and proceeded to hand me a bunch of pamphlets on autism. I began to cry I was so caught off guard- is this normal in a speech therapist line of work??? Autistic or not I love my son- and I\u2019ll do anything for him. I just really was hurt hearing this lady diagnose my son because she can\u2019t seem to get his feeding on track. He is a year and a half.",

            "comment": "Speech therapists often work with a team of professionals to identify/determine if indicators for autism are present. That being said, parents should be included in the evaluation process for their child. Parents should never feel blindsided with a diagnosis, so I\u2019m very sorry to hear about your experience. While SLPs can identify characteristics of autism, keep in mind that this is different from a medical diagnosis, as determining this type of \u201celigibility\u201d for a child in an EI program grants them access to additional intervention services (such as speech, OT, PT). Aside from feeding issues, are there other concerns? Joint attention, responding to name, showing interest in others\u2019 faces? Feeding difficulties alone do not point solely to autism. You may want to check to see if there is a pediatric feeding clinic in your area that can conduct a swallow study to provide additional information and guidance in the area of feeding (the one in my area is at our university hospital). Regardless, early intervention is critical and you deserve massive praise for helping him succeed!",

He\u2019s had two swallow studies and they didn\u2019t seem to shed any light on issues with swallowing. He just doesn\u2019t seem to be able to chew if that makes sense. He can point / babble/ hold \u201c convo\u201d of babble/ make eye contact etc but feeding wise he\u2019s just really not understanding the concept of chewing.",

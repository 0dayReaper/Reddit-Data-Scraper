    "postText": "My ex got engaged a little less than a month ago. This morning she texted me a song link from spotify and asked if I had heard it before. Our relationship ended four years ago on bad terms, we dated for two and a half years. We didn't talk for about a year until she reached out \"just to say hi.\" She will reach out about every once in a while, in the past she would reach out whenever things were not going well with her relationships or for career/school validation. I'm not sure how to respond to her or if her fiance is even aware she is contacting me fairly regularly. Is it appropriate to reach out to an ex if you are engaged? And should I tell her that now that she is getting married I don't think she should be reaching out to her ex? I just don't see this as healthy for her relationship or for my peace of mind. Thanks in advance for the advice.  \nTLDR; my ex got engaged and still reaches out to me, is it inappropriate and how would you respond?",

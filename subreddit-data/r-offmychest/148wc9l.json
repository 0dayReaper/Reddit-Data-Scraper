    "postText": "I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about ending my life. I\u2019m close to actually doing it. \nThe world sucks and we are under the rule of psychos and pedophiles. I don\u2019t see change unless they are killed. \nI think I\u2019ve touched enough hearts already. I\u2019ve done my best, maybe I could do more but it doesn\u2019t even matter. Most people won\u2019t care or even remember you. One moment your there and the next your not relevant. \nMaybe I could join Alicia. \nI could be at peace like her. Maybe I\u2019ll secretly say my goodbyes now. And I\u2019ll make it quick. I\u2019m ready to see what\u2019s on the other side of anything. There is no point. I\u2019ve lived that\u2019s point enough. I think when I go home I\u2019m gonna end it this time. I\u2019ll make sure to shoot my head properly like how my ex taught me. So it\u2019s quick and painless. So I can finally feel peace too.",

I have hope that it\u2019ll get better, this isn\u2019t sustainable. You can do this. You are braver for living. It\u2019s cliche but find something to live for if you can\u2019t live for yourself yet. You are smart. I\u2019m sure you have so much potential. There is so much left to do! Daily affirmations helped me a lot and you need to say them out loud. Something about hearing my own voice helps me build confidence! We can do this. Don\u2019t be ashamed, ask for help from someone close or call the hotline! You are worth so much more than this, life has so much more to offer you!",

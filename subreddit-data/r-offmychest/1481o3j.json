    "postText": "My (26f) boyfriend (23m) picked up dog poop with his hand. When he gets mad or upset or overwhelmed, he always seems to lash out. Usually it\u2019s him throwing his phone on the ground or something similar. This time he got upset at me asking to either help clean up the poop/pee or take the dogs out so I could clean it, and he said he didn\u2019t want to do either and when I pushed for it, he just picked it up with his hands. When I brought the dogs back in, he told me it wasn\u2019t a big deal and if I wasn\u2019t such a germaphobe, I\u2019d see that. I think I want to leave him but I can\u2019t tell if this really isn\u2019t a big deal or not",

The way he release anger by throwing things is anger issue but picking up poop\nWith his bare hands sounds like impulse control &amp; anger all at the same time. \n\nIdk how long you\u2019ve been together but behavior like this tends to escalate to where it become full in abuse in some form or another. Stay safe and take care of yourself",

I mean he was trying to help her out, but she was so disgusted and all she could think about was that he basically sucked turtle shit through a straw and she could no longer kiss those lips...\n\nI saw that you guys will try some counseling, good for you. But it's ok to have your own limits even if he doesn't agree with them. I have kids and have definitely caught barf in my hands and had to pick up poop in my hand because a child handed it to me when I wasn't looking, but I still thought turtle sucker was gross... so you know, you do you!\nGood luck!",

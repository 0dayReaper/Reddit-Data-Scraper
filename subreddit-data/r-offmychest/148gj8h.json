    "postText": "Long story short. My boss and I had a situationship. \n\nWe became really good friends then one night, we crossed the line and kissed but we knew we couldn\u2019t be together because we\u2019re both in a relationship. \n\nI thought we were good friends but he suddenly distanced himself. It\u2019s been over 6 months since he started being cold towards me. \n\nI still feel hurt that he suddenly went cold and I figured he really didn\u2019t care about me. And I wish I could talk to him about it but I know that really wouldn\u2019t change anything.",

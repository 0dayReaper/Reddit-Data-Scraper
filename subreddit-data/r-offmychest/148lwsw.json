I hate to admit it but during that time I kinda enjoyed the comfortness I felt as if  someone had told me its going to be okay lol.",

A combination of therapy, yoga, medication, meditation, books, and a serious focus on creating healthy friendships have helped a lot. Still working on myself and my issues. I imagine I always will be. \n\nThe moment you described sounds lovely btw. I\u2019m glad you got to experience a moment of tender, loving care. Wishing you many more of those moments \u2764\ufe0f",

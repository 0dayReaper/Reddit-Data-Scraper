    "postText": "Imma just dump this here:\nRelatively new to the care tech job, and  trying to do my best, but all the nurses do is cut me down behind my back. It really sucks, because it's hard for me to learn how to do new things and I'm always extremely slow with completing unfamiliar tasks.\n\nI don't even take lunch breaks and I'm running around as fast as I can and I'm by myself with anywhere from 8 to 16 patients. I'm frightened of losing my job, because I dont usually have enough time to even chart or finish my rounds and turns, because the nurses are constantly demanding my immediate attention at their rooms. \n\nI accidentally charted over a nurses vitals thinking they were mine that I screwed up and she blew up on me and then I accidentally took vitals at an hour I wasn't supposed to. I then messed up and told the nurse the vitals from my previous rounding on the patient and I got a little confused when she started questioning me about it. She proceeded to spread that like wild fire until we got off.\n\nYesterday I was having trouble getting vitals, because I had a load of turns to do at the same time. I also didn't know you could start rounding early and I could here the nurses talking sh1t about how slow I was being. I also made the mistake of telling the nurses that a patients ear was bleeding quite a bit and they crucified me for it saying thing like \"is he going to die\" with angry and dumbfounded looks\n\nI keep on making mistakes here and there, like forgetting to close all the tops on the purewick cannister or forgetting to find a blanket for a patient I just changed or forgetting to lower the bed all the way and arm the bed alarm. \n\nI'm doing my best here and it sucks. I just keep screwing things up, and some of the things are pretty egregious. I just wish that instead of talking shit, they would just hit me up to throw hands, because for some reason I just let words get to me and it's ridiculous",

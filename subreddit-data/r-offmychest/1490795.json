    "postText": "Typing this before I go to sleep, so when I say \"Today\", i mean the moment I wake up. Sorry if there is any bad grammar or spelling because i don't have time to check it.\n\nI'm gonna try to speed through some backstory.\n\nI was Mormon for 10 years of my life. Me and my siblings grew up in the Rocky mountains of northern Utah, and my mom's side of the family are some of the most dedicated Mormons you'll ever hear of.\n\nFor the past five years of my life, I've been catching up with everything I wasn't taught as a Mormon. Things like LGBTQ+, other countries politics, and most importantly that it is okay to believe in other religions.\n\nWhen I first left Mormonism, everything was very confusing. These new ideas were hitting me like bullets and I didn't understand most of it.\nI got severely depressed because I couldn't understand what was real anymore, and this was right around lockdown time so I was kinda screwed.\nI wasn't making any friends, and I had just moved to Texas, making it an even bigger change for me to go through.\n\nBy this point, I had decided to not let religion be part of my life. If something that was so real to me turned out to be so dangerous, how could I trust anything?\nSo I decided to be an atheist.\n\nThese were some very unhappy years for me.\n\nAbout the time I had turned 14, I learned about a thing called Pastafarianism.\n\"People who worship a FSM? (Flying Spaghetti Monster) How stupid is that?\" Is what I thought.\nI was so oddly intregued by this discovery that I spent weeks studying it and its believers.\n\nI came to fully understand this group of people, and I realized how wrong I was to judge.\nTo me, Pastafarianism had become my savior.\n\nMy depression eased away, and I was finally feeling good about myself.\n\nI told my parents right away that I had found something I wanted to be a part of, but their reaction shocked me.\nEvery day since we left Utah, they would tell me that I'm allowed to be whatever I wanted to be, do whatever I wanted to do, and express myself however I wanted.\nBut now, i saw them laughing in my face just when I was feeling like I had found a happy place.\n\nI brushed it off, thinking it would only be this once. Maybe they would warm up to it.\nBut they never did.\nEvery time my religion came up, they would mock, tease, and do anything they could to tell me I'm stupid for believing in such a thing.\n\nFast forward to today, I'm going to get my driving permit so that I can eventually get my American Driver's License. However, the official religious hat of Pastafarianism is a colander. This means that I am protected by the United States Constitution to wear a colander anywhere i please, including on ID photos.\n\nThis is something that I've been planning to do for some time now.\nI told my parents that I would be wearing a colander in my Driving Permit photo, and nobody was going to stop me.\nThey seemed fine with it at the time, but now, they don't seem to happy about it.\n\nMy parents have decided that I am not allowed to leave the house with a colander on my head anymore, and they will not take me to get a diving permit if I'm going to try and wear it in the photo.\n\nI think this is disgraceful.\nThey still think this is some kind of joke.\nI have told them both repeatedly that this is something that really means a lot to me and I need to do it.\n\nI know this isn't very entertaining, but i just need help right now.\nEven though it sounds silly, I'm very serious and very passionate about Pastafarianism.\nPlease, if I could get some advice on how to persuade them, i could really use some right now.\nEven if one person comments, that's all I need.",

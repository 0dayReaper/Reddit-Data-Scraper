    "postText": "Me (f20) and my boyfriend (m21) have been together 3 years and I met my best friend (f20) through him about 2 years ago.\n\nMy friend recently had a breakup a few months ago but has since said she is over him. Ever since the break up, my friend has constantly compared my boyfriend to her ex, saying how it\u2019s unfair that I get to be with my boyfriend and she doesn\u2019t get to and where can she find someone like him etc. Now this is pretty normal behaviour I suppose and I didn\u2019t think anything of it until last week when we all went to a party together. \n\nWhilst I was talking to other partygoers my friend took my boyfriend into another room to \u201cshow him the room\u201d. Apparently when in there, she tried to hug my boyfriend several times, even coming up behind him and trying to wrap her arms around his chest. In my opinion, this is not normal for my friend to do. \n\nI\u2019m not opposed to me or my boyfriend hugging other people but this seemed to cross a friendly boundary into something more flirtatious.\n\nThe only reason I know this happened was because he told me she made him uncomfortable and he immediately left the room. \n\nShe also did other weird things this night towards him, but again I didn\u2019t see any of it directly, I just heard it from my boyfriend and another mutual friend.\n\nThe other stuff she did I can explain by just being friendly, or intoxicated but taking my boyfriend away into another room and feeling him up just feels really sly? And not to mention my boyfriend was extremely uncomfortable with this.\n\nAll the comments she\u2019s made about how great he is keep coming to mind.\n\nAt the end of the night my best friend ended up hooking up with someone else and we left the party.\n\nNow she won\u2019t stop texting me asking me what\u2019s wrong which is another weird thing because I never said anything to her and haven\u2019t seen her since. \n\nWe have an overseas holiday coming up in a few months time and I\u2019m at a loss for what to do because I feel uncomfortable going with her but I also don\u2019t want to lose the money I spent. \nUgh! Hoping to get anyone\u2019s opinion on this situation!",

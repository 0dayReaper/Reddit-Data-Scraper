    "postText": "My best friend who we will call Julia (F20) has been dating a guy we'll call Ken (M21) for a while. They are each other's first everything and when I say Julia LOVES ken, she's obsessed with him. She made paper flowers and butterflies for their 6 month, constantly spends time with him, will go anywhere as long as he's there too, and she genuinely loves him a lot. \n\nBut the thing is Ken is incredibly rude and mean to her. He's always making her feel stupid, making her cry, physically abusing her (and doesn't apologise), leaving her when she needs him, hanging out with other girls more than he hangs out with Julia, etc etc.  \nNo matter how happy Ken makes Julia and how much she loves him, I really never liked him and I've been open about it. He is probably the worst boyfriend I've ever witnessed.\n\nA while ago, I found out from a mutual friend who I'll call Henry (M20), that Ken had lost all romantic attraction or emotion towards Julia and that he finds her annoying. He plans on breaking up with her very very soon.  \nI know this will make Julia incredibly sad because she loves him so so much. I really do want to tell Julia about his plans and everything. He's also talked behind her back calling her \"broken\" \"annoying\" and a lot of nasty things. She'll be crushed when she hears these things.\n\nBut if I do tell Julia about this, I'm scared she'll confront Ken and interfere with his plans of breaking up. (I know it sounds bad but I think it will be better for the both of them if they broke up). Either that, or she'll get mad at me and refuse to believe me. She's so deeply in love with Ken that I'm scared for her if they do break up. She won't take it well at all.\n\nI don't know if I should tell her or not, I've just been keeping this a secret. I don't know what to do.",

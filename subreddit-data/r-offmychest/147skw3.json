    "postText": "I absolutely hate children and the presence of them. They are a complete disruption to my peace and my life and I absolutely can\u2019t stand them. There are kids in my life that I do love and can tolerate, but as a general rule if there are children involved, I don\u2019t want to be there. \n\nIf my friends or someone I associate with become pregnant, I become extremely disappointed and begin grieving the relationship I had with them. I try to be happy, and I am happy in a way for them if that\u2019s what they\u2019ve been wanting, but I get a negative deep chest feeling that can\u2019t shake. I even unfollow creators online when they become pregnant because I hate the \u201cmom/dad life\u201d and baby content with a passion! \n\nAll this being said: I never, ever, ever let any body know this is how I feel. When I\u2019m around kids and my friends with their kids, I do everything I can to be involved and move past the way I feel. It doesn\u2019t change the way I feel deep in my chest, but I never want anyone to feel uncomfortable around me. When my friends tell me they\u2019re pregnant, I give my congrats and show them happiness, but deep down I just can\u2019t shake that feeling that our friendship the way I know and love it is changing. \n\nI am 30/F, married, work in healthcare, only drink occasionally/socially, and don\u2019t use any form of drug so this isn\u2019t coming from grieving a \u201cparty\u201d lifestyle, but more the freedom of taking weekend trips with my girlfriends, spontaneous dinner dates, and connecting at a different level. When my friends become parents, that always changes. Not from lack of trying on my part, but the inevitable responsibility that comes with kids and the changes in conversations and connections. I just do not connect with people whose personality and life relies in being a mom. I don\u2019t want to talk about kids or wanting kids. I am at the age that this frequently comes up in conversation and I get tired of explaining that I simply don\u2019t want kids. \n\nI don\u2019t know where this feeling comes from, and I recognize how selfish all of this sounds. But it is an immediate reaction and has been since I was a child myself. I am still a good friend to my friends with children, I attend every single shower and birthday party, I give gifts, I take their children places when they need me to and I will babysit if needed. None of this changes how I really feel deep down and I just feel like a shitty person. I have tried therapy, I have tried changing, nothing will shake it. \n\nI\u2019m not looking for validation, I know this is horrible. I feel horrible! I\u2019ve never opened up about this and I just needed to get this off of my chest.",

I would say people are obviously entitled to their own opinion but I'd ask you to consider actively working on trying to change your emotions a little - not because I hate your opinion or anything, but genuinely for your own sake!\n\nIf your friends are starting to have kids...you can't avoid that or change that, right? But you can try and change your feelings in order to have more fun around the children, I hope that makes sense. It's probably not easy though, I know people who dislike kids too.\n\nGood luck with this and well done to you for controlling your emotions around others when it comes to children.",

I have a severe aversion to pregnancy and motherhood, and I, like yourself, don\u2019t hate kids, but prefer the lifestyle that is allowed when they are not present. I like the spontaneity in life to do whatever whenever without having to worry about / care for/  find arrangements for the baby. I feel similarly when a friend has a baby and I work to hide how i feel the best I can.  I still keep these friends close of course! And i spoil their babies with gifts. But I have also accepted that that relationship has permanently changed and to experience the true social joy or spontaneous kayak trips down the river, alcoholic get togethers, etc, I will have to look elsewhere to find likeminded childfree people like myself to establish relationships with. I still talk to my child having friends everyday! And we go out to dinner together and sometimes shopping, but I know of course, the baby will have to come along, and that significantly slows things down, affects the trip in other ways. (And I only want to handle that in small doses if I\u2019m being honest, but I do feel guilty about it too sometimes.) I also know they won\u2019t really be able to come to my parties anymore, which I understand. But I keep them close because they are good and loyal. I\u2019m sorry OP, I know being childfree can be lonely at times. Just remember we would never be truly happy if we had children.",

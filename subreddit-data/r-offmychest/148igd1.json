    "postText": "My cousin(26F) and I (20M) are pretty close though we live in two different countries. It\u2019s been 2 summer vacation that I\u2019m spending at her place and she also visited me a few months ago. We have a close bond, but sometimes she act like I annoy her. Recently when I arrived at her place at her moms request( she lives with her mom and sister) she acted like she wasn\u2019t happy with me being there and that started long before I arrived. When she comes to my place, she is treated like a queen, she lacks of nothing and I make sure that she feels at home and welcomed. \n\nNow back to this summer, When I asked her if it annoys her to have me over, she responded by saying that she loves me blablabla and that she is very happy to have me over. However, her actions speaks louder. When it\u2019s time to hang out, she often makes comments on how I drain her energy and how I\u2019m difficult to live with. I know myself and know that I\u2019m not like that at all. I recognize that I talk a lot but beside that, I\u2019m very respectful to them and sometimes fade myself in the background just to not appear intrusive. Following her complains, I started to stay quiet and listen to music to disconnect. She started criticizing me for doing that as well and says that I\u2019m too addicted to music. Then I stopped listening to music I stayed quiet, again, she complains that I\u2019m too sour. And when I sleep and stay in my room, she says that all I do is sleeping. Sometimes even when something is missing in the fridge. She assumes that I ate it even when its meat( I don\u2019t eat meat). Plus the fact that she hates that I love recording memories.  She went as far as saying that it\u2019s wrong of me to not work( Though I worked once, which she refuses to hear) and when we talk about money, even when the topic is not about me; she says that I don\u2019t have a say because my parents pays me everything(she says that quiet often).\n\nThats only a few examples of what i go through daily with her. I really do not understand what\u2019s the matter. She can be loving, sweet and caring but its never consistent. I had a chat with her about some of her behaviour and she told me that I love playing victim and don\u2019t take me seriously. She then goes to their family/friend group chat and constantly makes fun of me. Does she really appreciate me or is she hating on me. \n\nIs she trying to make me loose my self confidence by making negative comments about me? \n\ntl;dr",

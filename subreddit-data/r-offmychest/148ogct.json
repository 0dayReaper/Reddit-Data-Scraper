    "postText": "I know this is pretty common...However, even though everyone has insecurities, I am convinced that I am the ugliest person on the planet. I have a big forehead, downturned eyed, small lips, big nose for a woman and a small chin. I think the rest of humans see me as a normal chick, not very beautiful but not hideous....(or maybe I am too positive) Nonetheless, just seeing myself in the mirror makes me depressed. I have even thought of not going out anymore because people don't deserve to see this ugliness of mine. I am only excited about the future posibility of having tons of cosmetic procedures and plastic surgery, it's my only way out, and I am willing to fix every ugly feauture...the problem is the money! Right now I am stuck with obsessing over my self-image, even though I have a pretty normal life with social life and work, the only thing that can make me Scream of joy is the vague posibility of achieving to be beautiful.\nSorry for the vent I just needed to express myself for a while",

I feel the exact same way about myself like all the features you listed I have too\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted plastic surgery too specifically for my nose but as of a few years ago I don\u2019t want it anymore because I realized I still won\u2019t be happy if I get it-there will always be something else I want to change or I will say they messed up the surgery and I need to get it fixed\n\nNow I have bdd and idk if u do or if u can relate to this but I thought it could help (so what I\u2019m saying is we may have 2 completely different experiences and I\u2019m sorry if any of this is like not helping) \n\nBody neutrality helps a lot to get me to a place where I can work myself up to liking my features and that may be helpful to look into if u want to! Pls don\u2019t feel pressured to because you are 100% valid for your feelings I just have been there and wanted to share what helped me in the past \n\nI hope you are able to get some relief soon :( I\u2019m rooting for you!!",

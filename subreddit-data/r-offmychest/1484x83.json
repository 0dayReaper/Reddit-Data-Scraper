    "postText": "Writing this on my phone sorry if that messes anything up\n\nMe and my bf have been dating for about 10ish months, in the first few months he was really aggressive and hurt me a lot during sex, I would tell him to stop/slow down/wait a lot for him to reply \u201cI\u2019m close\u201d and would continue for another 10 mins while I was sore and upset. I talked to him about this being bad multiple times and he continued to be rough with me, I stopped having sex with him due to this very early in the relationship. He began to be very upset and sad and we talked about it and agreed to be more gentle with me. The next time he was more considerate but when he was close he became more and more aggressive and rough with me, I tried talking to him about it again. \nAfter a few days he starts getting more and more upset, we get to talking and he feels like he isn\u2019t getting enough attention from me and he feels unwanted, I try to explain to him that I need him to be more gentle with me and I would do anything he wants he just has to be gentle, he is pretty strong he doesn\u2019t know his own strength. We tried again and I ended up having the worst cramps ever I didn\u2019t know it could hurt that bad, it felt like my body has rejected him and it was punishing me. \nAfter that we pretty much stopped having sex. Until I woke up to him inside me I flipped over real quick but I was still very tried so I fell asleep again. And most recently (a few days ago) woke up to him grinding against me, trying to fuck me in my sleep, i started to have a mini panic attack in the middle of it. He didn\u2019t mention it at all the rest of the day. \nI told of if his more calm friends about it and he said that I should talk to him about it again but I explained the first 3 paragraphs in more detail and that I already talk to him about it many many times, he just said to talk to him. I didn\u2019t talk to my bf about it for a few days (today).\nToday he wasn\u2019t waking up for hours til around like 3-4. I decided to look through his phone because he was being so different recently, I know asshole move, I found his notes about me, us not having sex, me getting distant, him hating me because of all of this, and multiple times he claims he wanted to end his life. \nI talk to him about it when he woke up, I explained to him that I no longer felt comfortable having sex with him. I\u2019m gonna talk to his family about him wanting to commit suicide later today because they aren\u2019t home. I don\u2019t know how to or if I even should continue this relationship. \nI didn\u2019t date people for a few year\u2019s before him and now I feel like I made this happen and I probably ruined my other relationships before this as well. \n\nI feel stuck",

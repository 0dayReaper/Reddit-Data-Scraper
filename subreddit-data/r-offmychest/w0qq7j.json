    "postText": "I was 8 and he was 28-30 (can\u2019t remember) after it happened my mom beat him so bad he couldn\u2019t work, but he never went to the police.\n\nLast i knew he was homeless and/or dead so i started to open up about what happened. I told one person his name and what he used to look like because he asked.\n\nThat friend put it around (without my name) and it got to the community he was staying with, one of the men had a daughter who died young so he murdered him, in broad daylight and no one stopped him.\n\nHe\u2019s dead and i\u2019m happy about it, i don\u2019t care that he had family. He wasn\u2019t given a grave so i can\u2019t visit him but i know if he\u2019s watching he hates me.\n\nI\u2019m the reason he\u2019s dead and I\u2019ll hold that forever, not to feel guilty but as an accomplishment almost.",

I will do whatever it takes to defend him and not go to jail, leaving my baby alone. There are a thousand ways.

Why he needed the medication and the cane, and she just told me to stop asking. I can\u2019t confirm it, but I guess my mom made a call or the dad of that 5yo took care of things himself.\n\nI do wish there was resources to help these people. Pedophiles are sick, but by just ignoring this problem in society, that\u2019s when they become monsters. It took me a while to get to where I am okay to openly talk about it, and I can only think of how my life, and that boy\u2019s life would be if he had had psychiatric help to stop him having those urges.",

I know we are supposed to forgive and forget or what ever, but what if you can't? He did something unspeakable to you, why do you have to continute paying for his crime while he doesn't give a care, and is out enjoying life?

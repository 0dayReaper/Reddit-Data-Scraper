    "postText": "Me (18F) and my sister (15F) usually get a long a times for a good 50% of the time. However sometimes if she is in a bad mood (which is fine it\u2019s alright to be in a bad mood) she has to let it be known by everyone in the house, now I don\u2019t mean that she will announce to everyone in the house that she in the bad mood. Instead she\u2019ll be a jerk to everyone, if I do something perhaps a little stupid or not the create way she\u2019ll have a go at me for it (even though it doesn\u2019t affect her in any way possible), this can range from literally anything. Other times even if she is in a good mood she\u2019ll criticise the way I talk, walk or just anything in general. When I say something back to her to stand up for myself as you see it\u2019s not just a single off hand comment she will JUST KEEP GOING until my mum or dad say something then act like she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. Hell if I say something back to her or even swear (I know I shouldn\u2019t really she just gets to my boiling point) she acts like she is a victim.\n\n\nWhat really pisses me off is that when my girlfriend comes round she is nice to my girlfriend. However once she leaves to go home my sister makes fun of her, just to note my girlfriend loves dogs (hell any animal for that matter) so when around mine she loves to give my dogs lots of attention. Like cute nicknames for them as well as giving the dogs a long fuss. So my sister makes fun of the way she treats the dogs and copies what my girlfriend says to the dogs in a high pitched mocking tone. My girlfriend likes Disney specifically Stitch she loves the little blue guy, my sister mocks her to me that she thinks it\u2019s childish. Honestly I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with liking Disney, anyway me and my girlfriend are a little on the chubbier side which I don\u2019t care about at all, because I love my girlfriend so much and love the way that she is. My sister however doesn\u2019t seem to grasp that I love someone who is slightly chubby so instead she ask me what I like about my girlfriend\u2019s apprentice then I ask her what she means? She just smiles and fucking side eyes me goes back to what she was doing. I asked her if it\u2019s about her weight and she just says to me \u2018I mean.. I just don\u2019t understand\u2019. She says that while trying not to fucking smile.\n\n\nSo yeah that\u2019s why I think my sister is an asshole.",

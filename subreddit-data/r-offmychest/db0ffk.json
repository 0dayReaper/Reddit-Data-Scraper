    "postText": "I photograph a lot of people. Almost everyone believes they are ugly. Your grandmother. Your child. Your best friend. Most models. Most actors. Maybe even you.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t take my photo, I\u2019ll break your camera!\u201d laughs the 80-year-old grandfather. When he dies a few months later, his grandkids will treasure this reminder of his \u201cugly mug.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease delete this,\u201d says a dear old friend. She looks beautiful. She looks like herself. She\u2019s been captured in a moment in which she is utterly comfortable in her skin. And she hates it.\n\n\u201cOh God,\u201d I said, because I had to get a professional headshot for work. \u201cI have a face like a slapped ham,\u201d I told the makeup artist I hired because I\u2019m so hideous that I can\u2019t bear to have photos of me around. The selfie I took of \u201cthe best it\u2019s ever going to get\u201d is my husband\u2019s iPhone background.\n\nYou will never see yourself with the love that others have for you. That\u2019s what makes a person beautiful, not angles or contours. You will never be objective about your appearance. But fortunately for you, your friends and family are never objective, either: They\u2019re biased to see you through the way they smile when you walk into a room. They want every photo of you they can get their hands on, because each photo is tied to your memory.\n\nYou\u2019re the worst judge of your appearance. Trust me. You look fine. The camera loves you. Now take a picture.",

Also, a quality primer beneath ALL of your makeup can make a huge  difference. Using flash will make the effect worse, but taking pictures in the latter half of the day, as the sun is starting to go down, can  both eliminate the need for flash, and casts an almost universally flattering light on everyone that can smooth imperfections.",

If the person taking the picture knows what they\u2019re doing, a lower aperture with diffuse lighting will help, and upping the Luminance setting in Lightroom afterwards can help, as well as lightly desaturating reds. However, this really sounds like something correct lighting can help with. It\u2019s hard to say exactly what else to try without taking pictures for trial and error. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that! I would say that it\u2019s good that it looks good in person - that\u2019s the most important part, right?",

Remember a happy memory, think of a funny joke, or something to get a genuine smile. See how a natural smiling face looks and see if you can emulate it at will.\n\nA trap that a lot of people fall into is thinking they're smiling when they're trying to hold a smile. Maybe they started smiling properly, but by the time the count down is finished and the photo is taken, people are often just staring at the camera with their teeth showing. I tell people to start smiling just before the last number to reduce the number of drooped smiles.",

Another thing I recommend is just to stand in front of a mirror and turn your head and body in a bunch of different ways so you can get familiar with what angles look good for you! \n\nAnother general tip is to stick out your chin a bit! Tightens up the skin around your face and minimizes any double chin action going on lol.\n\nThere are a few videos on YouTube you can look at if you\u2019re super concerned, but honestly most people don\u2019t like photos of themselves because the photo is \u201cflipped\u201d if that makes sense. Basically you see the opposite of what you look like in a mirror. Seriously, flip your images horizontally and I can almost guarantee you\u2019ll like it more haha :(",

I have a cleft palate and a coloboma.  I'm. never. going. to. look. good. in. a. picture.  And it hurts like hell.  It's making me tear up right now, actually.  It really hurts.  I will never be a beautiful woman, and it really fucking sucks.  Surgeries have corrected things, I look better, I look normal, I look fine in the mirror, but when you take a photograph of my face, things stick out, those birth defects stick out, hell, even *corrections* from the surgeries, things that made the bad things look better, stick out.  It's not beautiful, it's not flattering.  It's a reminder to me why I don't want this to happen, and it hurts.  And I get exhausted having to explain this to people.  It's actually humiliating and makes me feel worse.\n\nI do believe you are right.  I think people see you for you and not what you see -- either in your head or on a photograph or in the mirror.  It doesn't mean how you feel about it doesn't matter.  \n\nI can understand it from your side but I can also understand it from an individual's side who absolutely doesn't want their picture taken.  I wish... some people understood the latter and respected other people's boundaries to not have their picture taken.",

I'm actually genuinely ugly, and it kinda hurts to read messages like this saying I'm not when the world's been telling me otherwise my entire teenage/adult life. I've actually had someone respond to a profile pic I took with \"A face only a mother could love\". Once I sent a selfie to a girl I was talking to on here and she laughed and ghosted. Laughed and ghosted instantly. I don't blame her, either lol I'd prefer that kind of reaction, because it's honest. Pretty lies are pretty ugly underneath, an ugly truth is at least the truth. \n\nWhile it's true that people love me and might like to have photos of me to remember me, I am definitely ugly, not a shadow of a doubt. I don't like being told otherwise, being objective about my appearance if I take in what others have said and how people react to my looks I am truly objectively ugly. There are less than 10 pictures of me since childhood. I don't want to be in photos. I don't like to be seen. If I were allowed to, I'd wear a mask at all times, because that would make me feel comfortable in my own skin more than taking a picture of myself that I can hate to look at.\n\nI know, weird hill to die on.",

My partner is very self conscious and doesnt like how she looks but She Is Beautiful.\n\nLast week she needed a headshot for her CV. I set up the lighting, the flashes, the diffusers, the camera, (I am a photographer afte all) and it was one of those rare moments when she likes how she looked on the pictures. You know how ID pictures usually look and feel to look at  I wanted to make it as pro as I can, doing as many retakes as needed. \n\nHowever, it wasnt so great because of the setup, the lights, the pro camera... \nThe only thing that made the picture so great was the genuine, honest smile!! \n\nFor a of you, photographing people, make your subjects feel comfy, talk to them, dont rush it, dont jump into it, help them feel great before taking the picture, let them relax. If the smile isnt coming, try to talk to them.\n\nIt is so obvious when only their mouths smile but not their eyes, posture, soul.\n\nMake people feel great and natural.",

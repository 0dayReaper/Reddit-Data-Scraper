    "postText": "I\u2019ve dealt with my fair share of bad ones, but this one is especially horrible. She constantly is pushing people to do things how she wants them done. She\u2019s coming off straight up aggressive, but she\u2019s also being passive aggressive. Doing little things like telling me to keep my office door open and then getting upset and slamming it when I told her I prefer it shut so I don\u2019t get interrupted all day. She\u2019s not my supervisor\u2026 in fact, she\u2019s not overseeing anyone. She keeps giving people the wrong information too. She\u2019s just making assumptions on how things work here and not considering this is a new job and a new state! My list is so long and this just gives a few examples. I finally snapped on her today and reminded her she isn\u2019t my supervisor so she needs to stop telling me what to do. She tried gaslighting me and telling me that I was the one creating hostility. It\u2019s clearly her and my other coworker agreed with me. She also thought she was his supervisor (literally told him this one day) even though that isn\u2019t true. \n\nMy supervisor told me to have a conversation with her to let her know how she\u2019s coming across but it feels too little too late. I\u2019m so past my breaking point. How would you handle this situation?",

            "comment": "If she is gaslighting you and actually telling your coworker that she's his supervisor, nothing you say is gonna make much of a difference. You can try to let her know how she's coming across, but she will probably flip it around and try to blame you, then get angry and retaliate. You don't need to do things the way she wants them done, so do them how you prefer to or were taught to and have stronger boundaries about what you are willing to put up with.",

These aren\u2019t simple misunderstandings, these are deeply engrained issues. I guess I could have that talk anyway and when things don\u2019t change I can at least tell my supervisor I tried.",

            "comment": "In the harshest way possible, tell her she needs to check herself and step off. It's not her responsibility to micromanage her coworkers by using micro-aggressions. She's fully aware of what she's doing and it creates an unstable work environment, doubt, confusion, and a lot of anger. Your supervisor isn't guiding you correctly. It's not your place to have that kind of conversation with her. This is where your supervisor steps in and gets involved, not you. It sounds way out of your control and paygrade to have the tough talk with someone who's adamant about controlling their coworkers. It's a personality clash with the organization and coworkers and that's a supervisor's duty to handle. You and your coworker need to go above your supervisor, get together and write a statement against her.",

I\u2019m not going to get him to push as hard and admit how awful this woman is. He\u2019s always willing to let things slide. \n\nBut.. yes, this was my feeling too. My supervisor said I should talk to her but I really don\u2019t want to. Of course she knows what she\u2019s doing, unless she\u2019s literally on the spectrum. I feel as though I\u2019ll try to have this talk with her and then she will just be business as usual anyway. I doubt she has the capability to self reflect based on how she\u2019s been acting. \n\nOn our daily meeting in the morning she literally said \u201cwe have orientation today so any managers that want to stop by for lunch should\u201d and I went to her right after to tell her \u201clisten, we can\u2019t invite all managers to lunch because as you know we have to give them our head count for lunch and for seats. I look at the list each week and invite one manager depending on who has the most new hires\u201d and she looked at me and said \u201cI didn\u2019t invite them for lunch, only to come meet them\u201d I mean. Wtf. \u201cStop by for lunch\u201d idk how else people would interpret that. She couldn\u2019t even admit she made a mistake.",

    "postText": "I wasn't racist before and I just thought of them as people with different skin color. But now I'm starting to not like them. It may have started because I'm Asian and my family dislikes dark skin color even my own grandparents were insulting my dad and I for having a brown skintone.\n\n\nNow, I think I have nothing against black women but I think I don't like black men because of my insecurities and I think that they get all the white women which is my type. Hell, I was even uncomfortable watching Across the Spider Verse because of Miles Morales, but I haven't had any troubles watching the first movie. \n\n\nI do like a lot of black male people. I had some black friends in highschool but haven't gotten in touch with them. It was easy in highschool because they're the one who approached me and we became friends instantly. \n\n\nI hate that I'm starting to have this hate towards them. I am insecure and frustrated. I don't know what to do.",

That part isn't a choice, it just happens. \n\n But what you *do* with those thoughts and feelings is **absolutely a choice**.  If you dwell on them, build them up, put them into a feedback loop, you can turn them into monsters.   You can let them control your life.  Let them choose which movies you enjoy.   How you behave around others.  You choose to ramp up your racism to any degree you want.\n\nBut you can also dismiss them, counter them with positive thoughts, memories, beliefs, and make them go away.  That is also a choice -- but one for some reason you aren't making.\n\nYou aren't becoming racist in some vague uncontrollable way, and you aren't racist because of your upbringing -- you are actively **choosing** to be racist.  \n\nSo you have to ask yourself why are you doing this?  What benefit are you deriving from this hate?   Does it make your life more exciting, does it make you feel superior?",

I am assuming you are a asian MALE.\n\nNow! \n\n It's cool to feel bitter, atleast you somewhat know where that comes from. Probably also because you feel that there's no way this black dark skinned man that you and your peers look down upon could be attracting all of the beauty standards that you and your culture praise.. whiteness. Let's deconstruct your inner thoughts..",

            "comment": "Why though? Is jealousy the only reason, do you think? (Not that it matters) Sounds it.\n\nI don't think you don't like them. I think you might have too much prancing around in your brain, clouded by conflicting thoughts, brought on by your upbringing and families ideals. \n\nAnd also possibly the link in East Asia, where the lighter the skin, the more it is desired and considered beautiful. Could that be another reason?\n\nMy advice? Nip it in the bud ASAP. It's only a lesson you will learn the long and hard way otherwise, and probably with regrets. You are probably right about the jealousy though. Which can be hard. \n\nBut let's get down to the point. Judging/not liking people for their skin colour, is just idiotic. You already know that yourself. You don't want to end up doing/saying something you will most likely regret. \n\nYou sound young. Do u mind me asking your age?",

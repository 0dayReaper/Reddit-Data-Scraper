    "postText": "It's crippling to say the least. Why would I want to work for the rest of my life while in my early years I keep getting horrible work experiences. Bosses always suck, put certain expectations on the employees below them yet don't hold the same standards for their own work. Multiple employees for one job but instead of the workload being split fairly, if you're the competent one then you get more work becuase you make the team/location look great. Not enough staff in your location? Well expect more work to be put on you without proper increase in compensation. I'm currently a recruiter and I've been working here for 6 months. My first office job, but it's the same exact issues. People above you don't understand why people keep quitting under them and ask their current employees to confide in them to try and deal with the issues before people consider leaving. When in reality they want you to come to them first to prevent being talked about and being seen in a negative light. In each job, my  bosses have shown that they don't actually care about you and how you feel, they care about results. Be honest about your worries in the work place yet they do the exact thing that has been worrying you and causing you distress. I'm experiencing it all over again. I'm tired. I'm currently at work, been shaking all day because my anxiety is through the roof. I've been writing down my feelings and thoughts that I'm preparing to tell my boss since she wants her employees to confide in her so much. I dont mind telling the truth, I dont mind telling my supervisors about their leadership but I know it's going to be used against me than to help me. I've considered quitting many times but it's so draining looking and interviewing for work. I'm so tired of this capitalist society and constant exploitation in the workplace. I'm always in a team where my coworkers play dumb. I dont believe in playing dumb in my job so I have excuse after excuse why my work isnt getting done but clearly these kind of people float through their careers. Maybe I should start playing dumb and incompetent. I'm trying to be patient because I'm living with my mom and trying to save money to put a good amount into a house. Working for a living makes life so impossible. Work is a trap, always takes a negative toll on my mental and physical health. I'm on antidepressants again and they feel like they're not working this time. I'm constantly having crying fits at home. It's never enough money to actually enjoy myself. I'm not perfect, I make mistakes as well but so far in my job as a recruiter, I have never gotten negative feedback. It's been positive since I started recruiting, my name is always brought up in a positive manner. But my hard work is totally not worth the effort because I'm not benefitting from it. Just rewarded with more work. I dont believe in a career or climbing the corporate ladder mainly  because of my workplace traumas. I'm just tired...",

    "postText": "I worked in retail for about 2 or 3 years total. Thankfully I am no longer in retail, but I'm still not over the terrible treatment I received from retail managers.\n\nOne time an H&amp;M manager gave me a warning for clocking in ONE minute late. I was 10 minutes early waiting in the lunchroom to clock in since they don't like when people clock in early. Several people saw me in there waiting, and I based my clock in time on the clock they had on the wall of the lunchroom (they took it down right after the warning).\n\nAnother time while working for American Eagle, the managers made me feel like I was annoying them because HR forgot my paycheck for a whole month! They didn't even offer and compensation for not paying me for a whole month. If I was living paycheck to paycheck, I wouldn't have been able to pay rent!\n\nAnyway, I've been away from retail for years now (thank god), but something reminded me of these moments I had while in the industry. Frankly, I'm not over it so I need to let it out \ud83d\ude44",

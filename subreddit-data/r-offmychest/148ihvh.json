    "postText": "Our cat that we've had for almost 12 years has been overgrooming like crazy lately. It's gotten to the point where she's licking and biting off big tufts of fur, leaving huge bald spots. My mom and I took her to the vet today. \n\nWe intitially thought she might have gotten some kind of skin condition or fleas, but the vet told us that there weren't any obvious signs of either infection or fleas. She's suspected that it might be a symptom of something else and that there might be something wrong with her kidneys or liver. She's always been a pretty tiny and skinny cat since we got her, but appearantly she weights just over 2.1 kilos at the moment, which is about half of what a healthy female cat should weigh. I don't live at home anymore so I don't get to see her that often, so I hadn't noticed that it had gotten this bad.\nVet wanted to run some bloodwork. Thing is that since our cat isn't insured it would come out to about 540 dollars. After pleading with my mom and offering to pay a part the cost, she agreed. My dad was pretty upset. He thinks that it's ridicilous to pay 540 dollars just to figure out if we should put her down or not, and that we should just put her out of her misery and be done with it. \n\nWe're getting the results of the bloodwork back tomorrow. I spent a pretty chunk of my savings for this. Thinking that my dad might be right and that it's cruel and expensive to put her through all these tests if she's already too far gone and that maybe it'd be better to just let her die in her sleep with her family around her. But I feel like I at least have to try.",

And if its not, atleast you tried everything you could and you won't have a lingering feeling of \"what if\". \nCats easily forget negative experiences. So I think its the best 540 dollars you've spend.",

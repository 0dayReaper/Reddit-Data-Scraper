    "postText": "Dear wife,\n\nI first met you when I was 19. I\u2019m 34 now, but I still remember the moment I laid eyes on you. You know how people say, \u201cIt was love at first sight?\u201d Well, I used to think it was a stupid overused clich\u00e9, but it happened to me that night. You were a Renaissance painting come to life, with your emerald green eyes, smooth, opal-like skin, and wavy blue-black hair. Your voice was like bells pealing. Your smile, radiant and glowing. \n\nI was your first kiss. I was your first boyfriend, your first love, your first everything. We dated for 2 years before you broke up with me for the first time, over some silly argument I don\u2019t even remember. We were split for a year, and then you came back into my life.\n\nWe dated for nearly 3 years this time around before you broke up with me again when I was 25. You were scared by how fast our relationship was moving and wanted to be free. So I let you be free, but God, how it hurt me. We were practically engaged by that time. I was sketching out designs for a ring.\n\nI dated other women, but none of them were like you. You also dated other people, some good men, some mediocre, and some really, really bad. You cried in my arms after one of your boyfriends had yelled at you and left bruises on your cheeks. \n\nBut one day, less than 2 years after we had last broken up, you told me you were engaged (to one of the good ones). I went to your wedding. You looked like a Queen, every bit as beautiful as the day I first met you. How your face lit up as you saw your soon to be husband! I always thought, that when I attended your wedding, I would be the groom.\n\nWedded bliss didn\u2019t last long for you. After just a few months of marriage, your husband passed in a tragic accident. You miscarried your child. This sent you spiraling into a whirlwind of depression, anxiety, and opioid addiction. Yet I stood by you. I watched as you buried your husband and your unborn child, I watched as you collapsed onto the ground, watering the fresh earth with your tears.\n\nSome years later, we reconnected. You were recovered now, and more like the girl you once were. Your laughs were fewer and far in between, but they were still there. Your once youthful and innocent eyes were harder now, more weary, tired. But despite all this, despite everything, I still loved you.\n\nAnd deep down, you loved me too. For the second time before you turned 30, you were married. To me, this time. Sometimes, it hardly feels real. I wake up in the middle of the night and hear you breathing beside me, and a wave of pure joy washes over me when I realize that it\u2019s you.\n\nStill, I know that I don\u2019t have your heart completely. I know your heart is fragmented, and a piece of it is buried in a small graveyard by the sea. Your name is written on that tombstone as well, with your year of birth and a foreboding blank space after the hyphen. Some nights you wake up crying, and you will not tell me why, but I know why. Sometimes I know that when I wrap my arms around you, you close your eyes and pretend that it\u2019s him.\n\nI know that, and it\u2019s alright. I love you, and that\u2019s all that matters, so long as you love me too. Love is an infinite resource, and your love for him cannot deplete your love for me. I know that.",

Didn\u2019t matter how much she betrayed me, didn\u2019t matter how much she called me names and abused me. I still loved her. She left me 4 times in the span of a year or year and a half. \n\nDespite all that I still loved her. Now that we haven\u2019t spoken in some 3-4 months, I\u2019m realizing how bad it was. I loved her for the sake of loving her. She likely had BPD and I fell into the \u201chero\u201d role. Every time a man screwed her over, I was the target because she knew my love for her would blind me to how I was being treated. She knew I would always be there on the side waiting to \u201csave\u201d her. She\u2019s someone I would have easily let keep using me. The only thing that really saved me was no contact, it allowed me to see things clearly. \n\nEssentially I was addicted to being in love, and let myself be trampled because of it. I\u2019m grateful it happened though because now I know what to look for on the other end, and I know that I would want someone to love me back the same way I would love them.",

I know next to nothing about this man, and she gets very upset every time I ask. She told me about a month ago that a day after the murder, his dead body was pictured in the newspaper; and even though her parents tried to stop her she walked to Sheetz to pick up a copy. I can\u2019t even imagine what that was like. Canceling a wedding like that must\u2019ve been heartbreaking. But my father has dementia and has been reverting, and he told me the clock that has always been in our living room was the guys.

I think it would be near impossible for her to forget about him completely (because, let's face it, it's difficult to let go of someone that you love), but I feel like she needed more time to grieve and be by herself. I respect your patience and ability to love her without judgement, but clearly there is a part of you that is hurt. You can only spread yourself thin for too long before the resentment starts to surface. If you are okay with this arrangement, then more power to you, man.

There is absolutely enough love in a heart to go to more than one person. How do you think a parent loves their children? I know a couple that were a widow and widower. They have been married for a few years now and while they were happy with each other before, they absolutely glow now. And I know that both of them remember their previous spouses with love and affection. They love each other no less, because of this. It takes some time and adjustment. She will do better over time. Just remember that when a person loses someone, they don't forget about them. They don't want them to be forgotten. She may want to talk about him sometimes. It may be healing. Personally, I have never lost a child (thank the good Lord), but I know parents of lost children still want to talk about them. So, while she may not want to... She might. And while it wouldn't be healthy for her to lose herself in misery from it, a little rememberance from time to time may be good for her. Sorry to ramble. God bless you",

    "postText": "So, I knew(sort of) the Nashville Covenant School shooter. Aidan/Audrey hale. Not well at all, but we\u2019d see each other multiple times a week. I didn\u2019t try to befriend them, as I stupidly assumed they had their own group of friends. I think I\u2019ll regret that forever. In the aftermath learning how much pain they were in, and so they decided to inflict pain in so many other people.\n\n\nOne of the things that really fucks me up, is that I didn\u2019t know they had changed their name or anything. I was introduced to them as Audrey in like late 2020, early 2021 probably. I can\u2019t really pinpoint when but COVID was still kind of a thing. I have photos of them in the background in Jan 2021. That was two years of being around them. Two years I could of helped. I didn\u2019t, and it\u2019s eating at me. They never updated me on their name. Maybe because I wear cross necklaces they thought *\u201cthat persons is homophobic\u201d* but im totally not, I went to pride last year, I\u2019m going again this year in support. I have two supportive shirts I wear that idk if they ever saw.  They really could of said something to me. \n\n\nAlso what has me thinking of them today, is I mentioned how weird it is that idk they go call them pronoun wise to another person who also sort of knew them from the same place. Our mutual person said *\u201coh I actually asked Aiden/Audrey that and they said \u2018any pronoun is fine\u2019 \u201c* like they didn\u2019t care what pronouns you used but decided to also be someone to shoot up an elementary school? WTF!?! People will bite your head off if you accidentally misgender them and this person was like \u201cwhatever is good\u201d and also decided to take children lives?\n\n\nI think what fucks me up, is the person I knew, meek, mild, considerate, no type of trouble or weird vibe at all, also decided to fucking kill people. Not just people but kids. And there are rumors of the antidepressants they were apparently on influencing them to do, but like it can\u2019t be that influential. Like they decided to do that, and I\u2019ll never understand.",

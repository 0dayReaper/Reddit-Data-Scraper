    "postText": "Just in case I'll blur it because this is kinda triggering I think \nTW very very bad stuff i guess\n\n\nI just really need to get this off my chest, on saturdays I have church class on saturdays at 3 till 4pm but after this past saturday, I talked to my teacher about what has been happening with me. I have voices in my head telling me to hurt myself and to hurt others, they're telling me ways on how to do it and I specifically target someone and I don't understand why. I had dreams where I had killed her and felt nothing but pleasure and waking up to how real it felt. I kept telling her that these voices aren't mine and that I need help, unfortunately, she let others know and the pastor too, and then my parents which we had a long conversation about. My parents are extremely religious, it's hard for me to get professional help because of this..they don't trust the system at all, all they believe are the negative stories from getting professional help and never listening to the good ones, I know them so well that they'll just say \"the devil is controlling you\" and \"this is the work of the devil\" and yeah, that's what happened. Exactly as I predicted man. I just wanted help, I even told my teacher that I really need to be in a psychiatric hospital because I'm scared I'm actually going to do something to this target or off myself. Even worse, I'm 16, AND a girl. Look, if I tell any other adult, they wouldn't believe me and would just call me edgy, that I'm just overreacting and attention seeking. It's either that or that I'm close to that time of the monthm I'm tired of it, sick of it, and I just don't know what to do, I constantly hear these voices every single day for hours, I've lost motivation, I haven't eaten well either. I don't know, maybe I am just overreacting, I just wanted help, I know I need it, but there has always ALWAYS been something preventing me from fully receiving professional help. I don't want to be miserable with these voices telling me stuff, plans, and specific ways on offing myself and others. I guess that's it, I'm extremely unstable right now and I just needed to get this off my chest. Please if anyone could help me I would greatly appreciate it, I'll take anything bruh, I just need this help",

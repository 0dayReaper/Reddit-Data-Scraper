I hate my life, I hate my autism, I hate this shit. Why can't I just die already. The world would be better without me, FUCK my autism, FUCK my life, what do I do? Meds and therapy don't do shit. I just want a friend and I wish to be loved. This makes me look weak, I'm being pathetic. Nvm, what should I do?",

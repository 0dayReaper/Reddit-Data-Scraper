    "postText": "My daughter just spilled her whole cup of jello on the carpet. And she just looked at me and said \u201cmommy I spilled\u201d. She was so calm and just asked for help. I walked over and helped her clean it up. And I JUST realized something. \n\nNow this may sound silly but the fact that she was calm, not scared or trying to hide it.  Not terrified or crying or anything. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be in trouble (which she of course is not). \n\nBut it made me so fucking proud of myself. I didn\u2019t scream at her like my parents would have. I didn\u2019t tell her she\u2019s stupid or get angry at all. And the fact that she knows that. She knows it\u2019s ok to make mistakes and I\u2019ll just help her. \n\nBreaking the cycle folks! So glad my kid doesn\u2019t have to be afraid to make a mistake!",

You\u2019ll likely have thick skin from all of that though. I really hope you\u2019ll be able to flourish in spite of being raised that way. \n\nSending love and luck your way.",

I don\u2019t know if we will ever be entirely past it, but kids like this - they\u2019re gonna grow up feeling safe and loved. When that kid makes a mistake as a ten, twenty, thirty year old, their first impulse will be to ask for help. When someone knocks their door, they\u2019ll think it\u2019s a guest, not a danger. No matter how we go on, there\u2019s kids growing up right now who know the world is kind and safe and by and large a good place with good people, and that\u2019s a pretty good start",

Children who have learned to feel guilt over mistakes seek out an adult to help them fix it. Children who have learned to feel shame over mistakes hide from adults.

I really want to change it, and be better than I how I grew up. My kid doesn't deserve it. My frustrations get the better of me, and I succumb to the weakness on myself of all the pressure. I've fought my anger, and my depression for years, tried many different medications, a career change, and coupled with the chronic physical pain I caused myself and failure of ironing out my faults makes me feel worse than before. I keep telling myself that they saved me, but when I lose my temper and yell, I sink deeper into the depression I was fighting because I feel awful about what I've done. I'm tormented by the shit person I am, all the lying I've done towards myself. I bottle up all my emotions from the physical emotional and mental toll my fucked up body and brain to me, and the dam burst tonight and I cried harder than I did at my grandfather's funeral. I have withdrawn so far into myself that my wife doesn't feel love anymore, and I've put myself into a corner. \n\nKeep being the glimmer of hope in the world. I hope one day I can pull it together before I lose it all.",

Three seconds in, three seconds out, three times. Practice it once a day so your remember it easier when you're anger starts to overwhelm your patience.\n2) Color Game. When you're angry, think of a color and identify 5 things around you with said color. Choose another color, identify.

I'm not a parent, but I know someone who is just like you and I don't even mean that in an insulting way, because I am just like both of you!! \n\nWell, mostly; I don't bottle things up, but the thing is, I might as well be doing that because of how quick I am to frustrate and turn hostile. My anger and mood swings run deep for almost what seems like no reason, and some days even just a question asked slightly off can make me flip out. I have no ability to articulate why I feel so angry at the littlest of things, so I totally understand what you mean when you say that you just shut people out.. I end up trying to hurt people with hostility (in passive aggressiveness and words, nothing physical though)  \n\nI just want you to know that whether it's with friends and family and partners like in my case, or children like in your and my friend's case, or it's inward or outward... People like us, with disturbed emotional stuff, we're out there. Not everyone is the picture perfect parent, friend, etc.. and I hope you know that we know what it's like to fight so hard just to be seen as slightly negative instead of extremely negative. To be considered a monster at times because of anger or sadness that swallows us whole.\n\nIt feels like a losing battle some days, because the people we love don't deserve the treatment we give them when we're angry. Bitter words, slammed doors, snide comments... We know it hurts them, that's why we do it in the moment. And that sounds like it makes us horrible people, but no, that's just what anger does. It's meant to protect us, just like anxiety, so it does so by lashing out. And when we calm down, we feel awful..\n\nBut at the same time, we're here, we're alive, and we ARE trying.. and I think that's what they see in us. They know it's not on purpose. That's no excuse for being abusive, I know - but it's just something to think about.",

It was one of those with the built in brush, and the receptacle just kind of fell apart. We immediately scrubbed tf out of the carpet, and thank goodness the stain came out, but mother can still see the spot where we had to scrub (I can\u2019t), which she has reminded me as an adult. Could you imagine holding a grudge about a spot on a carpet that isn\u2019t noticeable to anyone else for like 30 years? She wonders why I\u2019m the way I am. I distinctly remember the fear and helplessness. I\u2019d be sick if my child felt that way toward me",

Even now, I am 24, I still get that look where my mom is just like, expects me to not spill things or drop things, like I don't do it on purposely of course, accidents happen. I think this led me to not really be open with my parents either, because their reactions were just too much to deal with when I was growing up. I don't want to have kids of my own but I sincerely hope parents don't treat their children like making accidental spills or dropping things and such is a bad thing because honestly, we as adults still drop and spill things and we clean it up. It's definitely not a childish thing.",

Cussing and screaming at her for over an hour. At a couple points she yelled \"I don't love you!\" I wanted to call CPS so bad, I heard all of it through the wall, and all of the other fits that monster had. But everytime someone had called them on that women it made it worse. The kids (girl and her brother who was about 12) got taken away a couple times, but always given back after a month or two (it was usually due to an arrest for drug involvement, but I think she would snitch on her friends to get off the hook), and the treatment got worse. I swear to God that boy was a psychopath by the time they were finally evicted. The look he had on his face as he was walking to the car with his bags the last day, holding the leash of his devil Chihuahua, he had lost all humanity. Moved in as a sweet boy with bright eyes, one year later left with the look of someone who'd had their soul sold off. \n\nThe last month he had watched his dog chased me and bite an older lady, laughing, and then fumed when the lady threatened to have it taken away (can't blame him for being angry, that's a disgusting thing to threaten a little kid with, but it was that type of angry where they don't don't talk back- just glare as if they will stab you in your sleep). \n\nI'm pretty certain the kids weren't moving with her, heard a credible rumor they were being put with her ex, who was the one who got them evicted (he was a good guy and left her because of how she treated them, he had no idea she wasn't a sweet lady until he met the kids).\n\nIt's been a few years now, I just hope those kids got therapy and a caring home before it was too late, that boy especially. The girl could recover to functionality, but I don't know if her brother could be turned around. He was school shooter material.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone I\u2019m a 34 male and I live in New York. I know this post is going to be completely silly for someone my age but I really need some direction or suggestions. I have been soo confused as to what to do with my life in terms of career or what I would like to do for a living. I was born in NY and then moved to a community that people would label the \u201chood\u201d. I moved there when I was 10. My parents are immigrants and don\u2019t know much about how American schooling or how much else worked in NY. I didn\u2019t know simple stuff that I would believe most kids would know like not knowing that it was my responsibility to choose a high school that I would be going too I\u2019m the future. I had to wait until the first set of papers were given to me to choose the school. I cut most of high school and got a GED. I would spend most time at home while parents are at work and most of my free time was spent at home tho I had friends if I got the chance too I would go home and spend time playing videos games. I had a tough time at home with a drunk mother who would put me and my siblings down which didn\u2019t help. I cut most of my time in high school. Around the time I would normally graduate I go to a college which is considered my zone college and take economics. It\u2019s here I realize the effect of what skipping school has done. I been given reports to write and I can\u2019t understand how to expand a question that would have a simple Yes or No answer. I can\u2019t understand the math AT ALL! So I drop out after two years of flunking. After a year I began to get yelled at by my father to go to a technical school and get a degree. A part of me wanting to do this to develop myself a bit and mostly trying to get him off my back. I would go to school for \u201c Electronic Security Systems\u201d which was just something I picked cause I felt like I would like to protect people I guess. The final was a test that would show that you  that you understand wiring which I had no idea how to do by the time this day comes along. I graduate and get my degree which is a surprise because the day of the final test I would need to pass not a would shows up to the classroom. The teacher sees me and ask if anyone had shown up I said then said \u201c Nope doesn\u2019t seem so\u201d he then asks me what grade I believe I should get in the class. I tell him with the hopes of passing at all \u201c I believe I deserve a C\u201d this would get me to just pass. I couldn\u2019t afford to fail since I would be able to pay to go another semester. He says \u201c ok you get a B\u201d. In shock I smile and say thank you and leave. I would now have the degree but no knowledge to back this up. Since I know this and myself overhearing that most jobs in this profession require candidates to perform wiring on the spot in order to get employment I was discouraged to attempt to apply for any work. Now years have passed and I\u2019ve worked in hotel business for 6 years and still work in a hotel as an Assistant Front Office Manager. I by the love of god still have both my parents and still live with them.I\u2019m not doing so well financially (poor decisions and terrible money management). I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting my current partner and the need to develop myself further is not only something\u2019s I feel I should do but also want to do. I could go back to college but I don\u2019t wanna get deeper in debt and or go in without being sure of what to go there for. I am very personable and have a way with talking to people. I thought I could get into marketing cause of my way with people but also follow in a similar direction with someone who got to work in gaming without having to be a developer (Reggie Fils-Aime). The fear of not being able to upkeep with school makes me freeze up. I have spoken with life coaches and they suggest websites that would narrow my search down but nothing excites me. I don\u2019t have people I\u2019m inspired by because I don\u2019t get inspired. Whenever someone accomplishes something I am happy for them but it doesn\u2019t ignite me. I know this post is all over the place and I\u2019m sorry to unload what\u2019s seems to be a whole lot of information to this sea we call the internet but I\u2019m at my wits end. This has easily been the biggest hurdle in my life. I truly believe that if I\u2019m pushed in the right direction I can progress but it\u2019s hard when I don\u2019t know what step one is.I would gladly take any advice or suggestions even if I possibly hear it before. I don\u2019t expect miracles or a handout but at least put this into the ether and hope for some help Thank you.",

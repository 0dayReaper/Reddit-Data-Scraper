    "postText": "I genuinely hate my dad. He never made me feel safe or secure. I grew in one of these families where the parents stay together for their kids and end up damaging them and seriously i'm probably the only one damaged in this household. I remember being 15 in dating apps looking for someone to save me from him, looking for a daddy to take care of me obce im 18. Why wasnt I looking to do Tiktok like my other classmates? Why wasnt I looking for a boyfriend my age or having a crush? Why was I always afraid to sleep alone, thinking he'd come and murder me? Why was I feeling most unsage when I was home? Why was the danger living with me? He destroyed me in every way possible, from my school life to friendships to everything. I can't even sleep the way I want, eat what I want, spend my money how I want. For him, i'm always too much, or never enough. He has always been passive aggressive to me, the way he looks at me, the way he mistreats and beats animals when he knows I like them, the way he feeds stray cats only to kick them once they get used to him, the same way he treats me, he loves the fact that I depend on him. I hate him with all my soul. I lost all sympathy for him. I will forever look for a man to replace and I hate this, I hate him, I don't feel any type of love or sympathy towards him, he ruined me.\nWords can't describe how fucked up I feel, i cant even talk about it normally, i just feel so terrible. I need a hug but nothing is reassuring.",

If the route for that is college, get your credits, apply and do it. That's your goal. Then you can proceed to safely unf\\*ck your life.\n\nHe sounds a total rotter. You needed only what a child should have. \n\nIt will become his loss, once you've gone.",

And also I feel some kind of dependence towards them, and I have super bad social anxiety. I don't know how to feel.",

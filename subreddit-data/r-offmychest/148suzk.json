    "postText": "There I fucking said it. I wasted my time and got a masters in psychology emphasized in social psychology. It is the most useless degree ever. Most of the time, people don\u2019t see you as a researcher, but in the same level of respect as a gossiper. You don\u2019t even get paid as much. \n\n I\u2019m going back to school to be an computer engineer. Fuck psychology. It\u2019s not even rewarding.",

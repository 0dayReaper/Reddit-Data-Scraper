    "postText": "In 2021, I was admitted to the hospital for a stomach ulcer that had begun (or had been) bleeding internally.  The pain was excruciating and the cause of which was, in short, stress from a roommate who had lost his mind through paranoia and illicit drug use.  He had had his accounts hacked the previous Halloween and the whole ordeal had caused our friendship to erode, along with his mental stability.  He was suspicious of everyone, especially me, and there was no convincing him of one\u2019s innocence.  His rent payments fell off and I had to kick him out after about a month or two.  In response, he dropped off the map for a while, falling into a deep paranoia that was fueled by drug use and feelings of betrayal.  \n\n\r  \nWeeks later, he returned with vengeance in his heart.  He broke into my apartment, stole my gun, and had it planned in his mind to kill his dealer (to who he now owed money).  Additionally, he had threatened to kill me, as well, if I attempted to stop him or report him to the police.  Despite the fact that I was now facing eviction, seeing as how his normal half of the rent had recently disappeared, I gave him $200 to pay off his debt to his dealer and to bury the dispute.  In his paranoia, though, he opted to buy a new phone that \u2018the hackers\u2019 couldn\u2019t corrupt.  And with that, he disappeared again, only to reappear 3 weeks later with my gun and a stronger conviction to go through with his plan.  After all of that time suffering with the ulcer which the stress had caused, two weeks of which I had somehow still continued to go into my job, despite the pain, I was finally rushed to the hospital when it became apparent that I could no longer endure the marathon of challenges, stress, and pain.  I was given 2 blood transfusions, emergency endoscopic surgery to patch the hole in my stomach, and made to stay in the hospital for 3 days.  \n\n\r  \nWhen I was released, feeling much, much better, I chose to visit my friends, rather than attend a welcome home party that my mom had planned for my discharge from the hospital.  I was informed, upon my arrival, that my friends had recently been served eviction paperwork \u2013 to which they had to respond, in court via Zoom, the following morning.  Having studied tenant law in the recent past myself, I decided to stay up all night with them and plan their defense, which I thought they had a very compelling case and a fair chance of winning.  That following morning, they had their hearing over the Internet and, with a few choice interjections on my part, were granted an in-person hearing with the judge a week later \u2013 which they in fact succeeded in beating the eviction case.\r  \n\r  \nYet all that was news for the future me.  Meanwhile, I was actually feeling pretty off-kilter following my friends\u2019 eviction hearing.  This was because in contrast to the joy of accomplishment I should have felt for attaining the in-person hearing for my friends, I was struggling with a conflicting sorrow in my mind and in my heart.  My supposed best friend and roommate had just been carted away to jail a few days before, after barricading himself in ~~our~~ his former apartment - and holding me hostage in it, at the end of the barrel of my own gun.  (Yes, thankfully I had managed to slip away and call the police before anyone else was put in harm\u2019s way).  Moreover, after the hearing, I had phoned home to share the proud news of the hearing win with my parents, and to apologize for not going straight home after the hospital.  Rather than sharing in my success, though, my mother had belittled my accomplishment, criticizing the fact that I had blown off the party she had planned for my successful stomach surgery.  \n\n\r  \nSo, with all that weighing heavily on my mind, I left my friends\u2019 apartment and took a post-hearing, early morning walk by myself to gather my thoughts.  As was my normal routine around that time, my walk included a silent prayer thanking God for another day and yet another opportunity to make a difference for good in the world.  Yet that morning, the prayer came out a bit different than usual.  I said, in soft-spoken words, \u201c*Thank you, God, for yet another day, and for another opportunity to be a force for positive change in the world.  I don\u2019t propose to be better than the next man, but simply a better man than I was yesterday.*\u201d  Simply as a matter of novel habit, which I had picked up mere months beforehand, I had decided to record that prayer on my phone \u2013 and this recording would later stick out in my mind as abnormally poignant in its nuance.  \n\n\r  \nThis simple recording, it turned out, was the 42nd voice recording that I had saved since I had begun the practice.  When I noted this otherwise irrelevant point, the number 42 reminded me of the movie, \u2018*A Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy*\u2019 and its story of a super-computer - tasked with answering \u201cthe *Ultimate Question*\u201d or, in other words, tasked with finding the meaning of \u201cLife, the Universe, and *Everything*.\u201d  For those who aren\u2019t familiar with the movie, the computer\u2019s answer was, inevitably and inexplicably, Forty-two.  Importantly for our purposes today, in this humble treatise, I ask that you please note that which has always struck a chord with me in its answer; that the computer later propounded for the perplexed posers of the question, on its reasoning for such a dubious answer to \u2018the Ultimate Question,\u2019 that they \\[the question givers\\] had perhaps not asked the *right question* in the first place.\n\n\r  \nWith all of these things swimming in my mind, I returned to my friend\u2019s apartment to share my thoughts on the apparent significance of my morning\u2019s walk.  To which my good friend Tom responded, quite unemotionally, that he wasn\u2019t so sure that there really was any sort of divine purpose, or ultimate answer, to man\u2019s purpose on Earth.  Not to be dissuaded, I briefly gathered my thoughts and replied with the following analogy;  \n\n&gt;\r  \n*What is the \u2018purpose\u2019 of a hammer?  A hammer drives nails into wood, or it pulls them out.  Right?  But a hammer can be used for many different things \u2013 it can be used to build things, or to tear them down.  A hammer can construct vast monuments, towering cathedrals, life-saving hospitals, and both cozy or even ramshackle homes.  It can be used to build those things, and so much more, or it could also tear all those things down.  A hammer can even be used for accomplishing things that it was never intended for.  You could kill a man, if you so wished, with the help of an innocent hammer.*    \n&gt;  \n&gt;\r  \n*So, you ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose of a hammer?\u201d  Ultimately, it is what the hammer is used for which defines its purpose.  Otherwise, we can see that its purpose is not a quality that is intrinsic in its mere existence as a hammer.  It may be that the hammer, as a tool, was designed with some particular task in mind.  Still, its ultimate raison\u2019d'etre is something further \u2013 a qualia only found in the details of whatever was in-turn built, or destroyed, or perhaps even left undone, because of its having been implemented in the first place.  Thus, so as too with each person, an individual life\u2019s purpose is found \u2013 is developed \u2013 over the course of the events of that life, through the products of that life, with which it is put to use making.*\n\n\r  \nWhile that analogy worked quite well for me, and my sanity, for quite some time after, there always seemed to me some further, unattained fullness in its simplicity.  Time went on, and life continued doing what life does to men and men\u2019s lives.  I paid off my debt to my apartment complex, avoiding eviction.  My roommate spent his time in jail and eventually, in court, where he was pardoned for his crimes, then chose to move back to his home state of Louisiana.  Sadly, Tom passed away only a few short months after that bittersweet, fateful day when I had had my \u2018Purpose of a Hammer\u2019 epiphany... along with a few other friends of mine who also met their ends in the months and years following all of those things.\n\n\r  \nFinally, though, the \u2018epiphany\u2019 coalesced into a greater whole, through *and despite* the upheavals that all endured throughout those weird, post-Covid-era years.  And it is this, without further ado, which I now freely and gladly share with you;\n\n&gt;\r  \n*The Purpose of a Hammer, as with a Man\u2019s life, is not found solely in whatever ends that Man or that Hammer is applied to but, rather, its purpose is defined and fulfilled in the act of helping the Nail do what the Nail was meant to do\u2026 which is, ultimately, to bring into existence what the Builder intended.*\n\n\r  \nWe *are all* both Hammers *and* Nails \u2013 building and re-building this world and each other, with each action, with each day which we are blessed to live and share.  It is God\u2019s greatest grace bestowed to us;  that we are blessed with the opportunity to be the creators of our own realities \u2013 the definers of our own resolution - of and for our and each other\u2019s own unique purpose \u2013 and of our own destiny.  So, with that said, I leave you with these words of encouragement \u2013 Go live your gift, your literal Present.  And as you create (and in creating,  ***find***) your purpose, do so helping others find theirs\u2026 \r  \n\r  \nAnd lastly, friends, I wish you all \"*Happy Building!*\"",

    "postText": "I am sorry to post this, and I don't know if someone will read it... But I just need to vent, I just need someone to listen, because I feel like I am imploding.\n\nI am moving to another country. I am from an European country, and I moving to another one that is still in Europe, not too far from home, but still a state where they have a different culture, speak a different language, etc.\n\nI am in the process of finding a new home. I am going for a trip to said country in a few days to scoop some rooms where to live. In the whole process of searching for a home, compliting the bureaucratic stuff, preparing the required documents for the new job, I feel so alone.\n\nI have never felt so alone and scared.\n\nI am 24 yo, and I have always been living in the same city. I was able not to depend too much on my parents during university, because I got merit scholarships and also worked. But I lived in the same city, same country all my life.\n\nNow I feel like I am turning a new page, and I don't know what is next. And this may be exciting to some - for me, it's a source of anxiety.\n\nI still feel moving is the right decision - because it will make me grow both professionally and personally. But the loneliness of going to a new, unknown place... is indescrivibile.\n\nThanks for everyone who read.",

But in the second semester she found a friend, then she meet other people an so on. When that happened we only talked on the phone 2 times a week. \nWhat I mean to say, the begging will be hard, but as you live there, find new friends and explore a bit you will feel better. It takes time to feel comfortable in the new environment.\nI wish you all the luck",

My advise is learn  the language as much as you can. Not everybody speaks English. Try to make friends. At work or find some hobby place. Caf\u00e9s are a great place to meet people. Be open minded. Your feelings are completly normal. If you miss home try to find some stores from your country or local clubs. Go for walks around the place you are going to live. Find a language school to learn the language. Yes there are many ways to learn a language online but if you to classes you Will meet people.",

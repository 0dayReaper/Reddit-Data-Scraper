    "postText": "Long post sorry in advance \n\nSo I had a personal trainer for a while. I payed for 16 sessions. He seemed like a good guy and was very respectful. One of my friends wanted to go with me but his rule was if I brought someone it would count as 2 of my sessions. However if anyone I brought bought any sessions for themselves he would give me free ones. Fair enough. \nSo I took my friend and after we left he found her on IG and sent her a message. \u201cGood workout, next time we\u2019ll add more weight\u201d not verbatim but it was along those lines. He was following up with a potential client I got that. \nBut then I took my cousins wife with me to another session. That time there was 3 of us there. I could tell she didn\u2019t like it but only cause she doesn\u2019t workout and he was pushing her like she\u2019s not used to. But she did thank me for taking her and she said she wanted to go back. \nAgain he found her on IG and added her and sent her a similar message. I believe the next day they were both at the same concert. He saw it on her IG story and he started messaging her over and over. She isn\u2019t good at confrontation so she thought that if she didn\u2019t reply he would get the picture but he kept messaging her. He then tagged her in his IG story. She felt really uncomfortable and her husband got very upset. \nShe told me about this the following night. So I messaged the trainer and told him how he made her feel uncomfortable and how it was inappropriate for him to be messaging a married woman. He kept saying he didn\u2019t message her anything inappropriate and he didn\u2019t mean to be disrespectful. \nI started telling him how it was a huge issue that he did that and how wrong it was. He is going to seminary school and should know better than messaging a married woman. I told him how she now feels uncomfortable and how he caused tension in her marriage. I told him he put me in a bad spot cause now I lol bad for taking her there. \nI told him since he caused this issue I couldn\u2019t return to workout with him and I would like a refund for my 8 unused sessions. He told me that he is professional and if I want to make this personal that is my fault. I could either use the 8 sessions or lose them. \nI said that he made things personal when he started messaging her about personal things. I even told him if he wanted to talk to anyone at his church about this he could cause I knew they would agree with me. There was no good reason for him to message a married woman. She never responded she didn\u2019t give him any indication that she wanted to talk to him. He said I knew his rules. I responded \u201cI payed on time I showed up to my sessions but nowhere in your rules did it say you would message people I took with me and make them feel uncomfortable\u201d he said \u201cwith all due respect who are you to tell me what my rules are?\u201d I told him he was disrespectful the moment he messaged her and kept messaging her without her giving him any indication that she wanted him to. \nSo basically he refused to give me my refund and said he wouldn\u2019t stand for this slander. \nI was livid. I\u2019m finally calming down and just letting things happen. I wish I could get my money back but it is what it is. :/",

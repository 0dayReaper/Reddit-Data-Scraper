This will be the hardest part, but as time goes on it will get easier. \n\nYou will slowly start to move on and the pain will be less day by day. \n\nThis is a process and it may take years for you to reach a point when you don\u2019t think about him at all on a daily basis. \n\nHe has found happiness and you should be able to do the same, but you have to heal first.",

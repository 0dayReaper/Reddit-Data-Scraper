    "postText": "I feel like the title says it all. \nI just really want to get this off my chest because whenever I bring this up with my partner he takes it as me self sabotaging or trying to push him away. \n\nI'm hoping some verbal processing here will allow me some clarity on the situation. \n\nMy partner and I have been through a lot. I come from a traumatic past full of the worst kinds of stuff, but have since been working on it, however, our relationship has been full of ups and downs emotionally. \n\nRecently we had a huge break because I was hospitalized and sick. He was more involved with his friends and seeking support. \n\nAfter getting healthier and now recovering, I've noticed he has been withdrawing from his friends and even from me. \n\nThere are a few points of evidence to this, like his withdrawal, less envolment, less effort toward me and his social group. \n\nBut on a January trip away this year his friend point blank said my partner seemed happier when he wasn't with me, or when he was around his friends and family only. \n\nThis has kind of confirmed my insecurities, but the fact that I got an unprompted confirmation is hard to ignore. \n\nAnd now that I watch, I do notice his lackluster with life, very flat and withdrawn. \n\nHowever we're out with friends or with his siblings he lights up. \n\nHe makes a point that he does a bit of showman-ship, to keep up the mood. But at some point I just don't think it's faking. \n\nI'm concerned he's in denial because we've been together so long. \n\nIt's one thing, to take him at his word. But another to see it and hear it activly been spoken by other people. \n\nI love this man it would break my heart to have this be true. But if it was better for his mental health, then I would stay his friend or even no contact. \n\nPart of loving someone in my opinion is to want the best life for them. \n\nNow here I am with no clue what to do and just coasting through on the thought that I will be here as long as he wants me here. \n\nBut watching him change Infront of me gets harder and harder everyday. \n\nAhhh thanks for hearing me out reddit. \n\nTLDR - \nAfter a break in my relationship because I was hospitalized for an illness, my partner has been showing signs of depression and his friend said he was happier without me around. But I feel like my partner is in denial about it. I'm worried for his mental health.",

    "postText": "(rant post) Im M(30)    i have been having a hard time lately. Everytime someone gets interested in me, its always the emotionally unavailable or in a relationship people. I recently met this girl, we were fine at first, we \u2018vibed\u2019 a lot. Planned things put for us, entertained her, but for some reason things turned 360. I later found out that she\u2019s in love with someone else and she just talk to me whenever its convenient for her. Didnt even got the chance to tell her what im feeling, i want her to know that what she\u2019s doing isnt right. The fuck, no one deserves to be an option!",

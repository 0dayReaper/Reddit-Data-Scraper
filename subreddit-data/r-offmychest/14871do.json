I dont know if it's something I'm eating or just me being happier here but I am constantly horny. Like the moment I get off work I'm rubbing one out. Watching a show? See cleavage? You get the point. I haven't been like this since I was like 16. Idk how to relax the flow. I get off and I almost instantly want to go again. It's just non-stop.",

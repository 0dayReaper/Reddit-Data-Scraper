    "postText": "\nI (16f) am an Australian high school student and I hate it. Nothing in high school interests me and it\u2019s been affecting me mentally a lot. I\u2019m in tafe as well and it is always something I look forward too and I want to move to tafe full time. My mum however hates this idea. She\u2019s constantly telling me no and won\u2019t even hear me out for the reasons. She dropped out at the end of year 9 and got married and pregnant at 17. I feel like she thinks I will do this but she doesn\u2019t understand how much of a struggle high school is for me. Whenever I want to do something I have to give her so much notice and she will just say no last minute even if it\u2019s something I\u2019ve done in the past. She controls the clothes I wear out and what way I colour my hair and when I\u2019m allowed to do other things. If I don\u2019t do things exactly the way she says she will just ignore me and act like I don\u2019t exist and call me names when she thinks I\u2019m asleep. She kicked me out of the house when I was struggling with addiction and just left me with my dad. She thinks I\u2019m sober but I\u2019m not. I feel like I have no other escape. Since I got a job I have to pay for not only my meals but hers as well. I have to help pay for her drinking since I\u2019m so much to deal with. I\u2019ve tried looking into moving out but it\u2019s so expensive and I wouldn\u2019t be able to without her permission and I don\u2019t even want to think of the screaming match that would cause. She\u2019s always getting into my business and I can\u2019t keep anything secret from her because if I do she will throw a fit. I\u2019ve considered living with my dad as he lived two hours away in Sydney but it would be a huge change and with everything else going on I don\u2019t know if I would cope. My dads planned a holiday for me and him to see my cousin and his girlfriend and two kids and it\u2019s been probably been the only thing keeping me sane but my mum keeps threatening me saying if I don\u2019t go to school she will just not let me go. If she canceled that trip not only would my dad be pissed off but it\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s done it. When I was younger my dad planned a holiday for the two of us in NewZealand and then a week before we went she told me I wasn\u2019t allowed to go and I was only about ten and I was inconsolable after she told me this. He spent over $3000 for us to go and I was so excited. My mums always upset with me when things don\u2019t go her way and it\u2019s gotten to a point that I think I\u2019m going nuts. I just don\u2019t think she understands how much I love my cousin and I think if she canceled this trip I think it would be the end for me. I just feel like there is no escaping her and I\u2019m not sure what to even do anymore.",

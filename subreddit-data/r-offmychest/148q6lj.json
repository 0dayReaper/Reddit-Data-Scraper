    "postText": "I moved countries three years go, but I still have contact with my friends from time to time because I love them. \n\nnow, while I don't speak very often with them, there is one friend who i speak to frequently, who we will be calling Martha. Now, Martha has been my best friend since primary. We lost some contact our first year of highschool but we have been close since then. \n\ni send Martha memes from time to time through my social media, but sometimes there is a specific behaviour she has which I frankly don't understand. she tells me that she wants her space, and she doesn't want to speak to me. i understand that sometimes we need some time for ourselves (i send her maybe 1 reel a day or two and sometimes we talk about each other's issues) but i don't know why she does this to me. i have never seen anyone have this behaviour, and when i speak to my parents about what she tells me, they get confused. \n\ni revised my chats with her and I don't see me saying anything that could potentially be offensive. i talked with her the other day by telling her that i didn't like the way she told me this (that she didn't want to talk) but all she did was leave me on read. we havent spoken for five days and I'm scared to initiate conversation because i wouldnt like to start an arguement with her saying I'm not respecting her boundaries.\n\ni may be overthinking but I've had a rough year with toxic friendships and honestly i wouldnt like to lose her because she is very dear to me.",

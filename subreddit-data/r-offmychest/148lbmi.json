    "postText": "I'm scared and worried that I might be a narcissist just like my mom because everytime I talk to someone or a friend, I unknowingly and realize it later that I'm redirecting all the topic to my personal stuff, oversharing things that I'm not supposed to share and other bs.\n\nI'm scared that I might be a sociopath or something else because I say and type the weirdest things when I'm playing with friends and I pretty sure they're getting uncomfortable with me thats why they chickened out when I told them I'm going to visit / in town and wanted to meet up. \n\nI'm scared to make new friends because of how I communicate with people and I'm jealous everytime I see my high school and college friends go out together. Or just see a group of people having the best time of their lives. I always wished and imagined that I had a strong group of friends that I can be with.\n\nI'm scared that I'll end up alone /never socialize with anyone since my parents never allowed me to go out with my friends fearing that most of then are bad influence (ie drinking, smoking, having sex, etc). They're not. While they allow my sister to go out with her friends and have a good time.\n\nThey never paid attention to me as a kid and expected me to have to learn everything on my own, have good grades, have a family, I'm not allowed to get mad (I had to bottle everything up), they get mad at me if I do, been gaslighted a lot and they expect me to be grateful and be thankful for all the blessings\n\nThey made fun of me when I made an accomplishment (I made it top 15 of my class (out of 30-ish students) which I count as a big accomplishment for myself because I worked hard and tried my best) and told me that its not good enough. \n\nI questioned myself at that point and told myself \"I guess being stupid, indecisive and irresponsible will be my lifestyle from now on.\"\n\nI'm scared that my family won't accept me when I come out as gay. My sister probably knew it already but I'm still worried that me coming out will impact my relationship with my mom since she wants me to have kids, etc.\n\nI'm pretty much tired of everything, I'm content of being alone at this point, I'm don't want to talk or vent to people anymore because I feel like they're tired and don't want to hear me talking. \"I'm going to hell\" because I don't pray and I'm different from the rest of my family.",

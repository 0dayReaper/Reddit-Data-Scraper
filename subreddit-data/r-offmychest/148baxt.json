    "postText": "Hello, so i need a friendly advice on which job opportunity is better for me. I live in a 3rd world country.\nI currently got hired in an agency/ marketing field. It\u2019s at a multinational agenc, it\u2019s a field that i love and a job i dreamt of having. However the total commute hours are 3 daily. And i go 6 times a week, the salary is about 500$ a month. But my problem is that i feel extremely exhausted from the transportation hours and its stressing me out. I received another job opportunity where its remote/ more sales related so not really a field i am interested in, the working hours would be late but i\u2019d work from home the salary would be around 900$. I am still wondering if its worth it to discontinue my current job for the offer. Thank you",

If you can live closer, you can try that for a while and see how it goes, if not, the other job might surprise you and you might love it. You might be able to save with the new job and move closer in the future to work again in a similar position as the one you love. There are many options to consider, but in the end it is about what you value more. Best of luck!",

    "postText": "My boyfriend is becoming more and more of an asshole lately.\n\nWe\u2019ve been together when I was 18, now almost 22, and until about a year ago, our relationship was going well. We moved in together after a year of dating. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what changed, but he\u2019s become a lot more cold towards me. He doesn\u2019t think about me anymore when he goes to the store like he used to, he won\u2019t compliment me anymore, doesn\u2019t touch me anymore, and even goes out of his way to make remarks on my weight gain, my hairloss, or anything else I\u2019m insecure about. Shit, he just screams at me when I\u2019m having a panic attack instead of either leaving me alone or comforting me. Not to mention him infantilizing me when he decides that I didn\u2019t do a task the way he wanted me to do it.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to communicate with him several times but he doesn\u2019t listen. He changes his behavior for a day or two and then goes right back to being a dick. I love him so much but I really don\u2019t feel like he loves me back. Thinking about this hurts but I really don\u2019t want to be stuck with someone who doesn\u2019t make me feel loved. \n\nI feel so stuck and he was the only person who treated me well in a relationship but he\u2019s starting to be the second worst partner I\u2019ve ever had.",

Sounds like this is alway how he was but was hidden away, but the honeymoon phase facade has now fallen off. Belittling you, talking to you in a condescending way, yelling at you are all red flags.",

    "postText": "Wanted to write a post about some of the things that have happened in my life. Step into my shoes.\n\nI was born in the UK. The youngest of 5 other siblings. My parents divorced while I was still really young, so I don't actually have any memories of seeing them together. The only time I have ever been abroad was maybe when I was 2-3? I'm so suprised to retain little pieces of information to this day. Things like the feeling of the hot india soil between my toes, it was so soothing and felt more like sand. I remember the feeling of no worries as a child, just being out in nature. But some bad things also happend to me while we were there. I suspect my siblings and parents knew the type of people who we were amongst. Not everyone there was all bad, apparently I fell off a tall building ( imagine at 2-3 years old lol) and one of my cousins caught me...to think I could have been dead 20 years ago. As much as we can appreciate the good, we must also acknowledge the shadow, that lingered behind closed doors. Now picture a 2-3 year old little boy being coerced by an elder female relative, to touch them inappropriately and being told to stay quiet. I have no idea how long this went on for but eventually we moved back to the UK. We sold our home and all our belongings to family so we could move to india, to live with people who didn't like us. Back home things never got better, I am the youngest and my family was extremely dysfunctional and violent. The closest age gap to me is 2 years, and the biggest is around 10 years older. Imagine fighting with your siblings everyday, imagine them all whispering in your ear while you were asleep only to all go hide and make you feel like you was home all alone. I fucking hated when they did that to me, I'd cry and they'd just laugh. Imagine being comforted and then beaten again withing a split second, imagine your own family putting glass in your bed and spitting in your mouth. Imagine being degraded and sexually abused by your own siblings. There was also another time when I wanted to use my brothers computer, it was rare for no one to be on it, so for me to peek into the room and see it was free? Imagine that pure excitement a kid feels in simple moments like that. I go running into the room enthusiastically, jumping high into the air before landing on this cushion chair thing we called a computer chair lol, only to feel a sharp pain going through my foot. Someone had stuck a needle into the chair so that no one else could use the computer. Come to find out years later it was my brother who put it there. My dad felt no sympathy for me, just kept yelling at me to stop crying as he pulled the needle out. My sisters were spoilt by my dad, but he always had time to take his anger out on me and my brother. He never took us to the dentist, never bought us new clothes, we had no money but still if the girls needed something then it was not a problem. One day the neighbour's son came to the door after we had just eaten dinner and asked my dad if I could come to the park with them, they were going to shoot their bows that they built themselves, I'm around 8-9 at the time so I find that stuff super cool and beg my dad to be able to go. He agreed and we went to the park, which was literally right across the road. I actually had fun with them, watching them shoot their arrows across the field, at a tree. It got fairly dark before we came back. Nonetheless I wasn't worried as I trusted my neighbor. When I got back home, all my siblings where panicked, \"dads angry, where have you been?\" \"Dads so angry, he called the police\". I was so scared because I knew I was about to get beaten for this. I walked into my room and soon as I turned around, my dad came storming in, shouting \"where have you been?\" Before hitting me once again. I told myself that day if that man ever raised his hand to me again, I'd kill him. What kind of a person thinks something like that at a young age?",

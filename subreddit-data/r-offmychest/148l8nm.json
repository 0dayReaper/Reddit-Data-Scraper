    "postText": "My boyfriend got arrested during a traffic stop because of a no contact order between the two of us. Everything happened so fast that I forgot that he had my debit card in his wallet and he got booked with it in his possession. I don't want to create anymore contact by him filing a release form with my name on it so would they be able to release it to his mother , or would they remove my card from his wallet and insist I pick it up, or does it not matter since it was in his possession?",

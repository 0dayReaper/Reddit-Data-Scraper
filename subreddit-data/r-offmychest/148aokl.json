    "postText": "I know I sound like a shitty person but I have my reasons let me explain.\n\nI met my old friend at my previous job which I recently left maybe about a year ago now. I was unhappy and depressed so I decided at 24 I have a career change and do something about it. I went back to uni and which I am about to graduate this year, and picked up my first industry job last year.\n\nWhen we do catch up she never ask how I am and what I have been up too. It's always about other people and gossiping about what they are doing. She commented about a friends weight gain and her sexuality saying how she doesn't understand that she's announcing that she's bi when she is marrying a man and that she is attention seeking once again. Making fun of this friend for going to the gym 3 times a week and wanting to go down to a size 10 and laughed and smirked at the same time.\n\nI told her I got the job, she didn't congratulate me she sent me half ass emojis, asking when I start and loved reacted my facebook post. that was it. no congratulations, no nothing! I've been at this job now for 10 months and she has not once asked how I am finding it, how is work, have I made any friends nothing. The only thing she ask is if there is any cute co-workers so she can go on a double date with.\n\nI passed probation and she was the only friend who did not congratulate me, even my hairdresser and cosmetic doctor always ask about work!\n\nWhen we do catch up she never ask how I am and what I have been up too.

Making fun of this friend for going to the gym 3 times a week and wanting to go down to a size 10 and laughed and smirked at the same time.\n\nLast time I caught up with her was roughly 3 weeks ago and she spent the first 1.5 hours talking about herself and friends relating to her and when I had the chance to speak about something that was upsetting me she goes 'no more xyz talk missy' I snapped at her and I told her I listened to you speak shit for the last hour and I said nothing. She cried and turned it back onto her and said because her job is toxic (xyz works there) and that xyz is fake. \n\nI had enough! I got in the uber on my last catch up with her and I blocked her ass. I tell her every time we catch up we shouldn't be talking about people that are not here and it does not concern me.\n\nI'm just angry because she is in an abusive relationship and I was the only friend who stood by her when all the other friends faded over the years, defended her and gave her a safe space and this is how she treats me??? I'm going with the fact that she is jealous that I'm moving on from that dead-end job and doing something better with my life.\n\nIt's been an emotional rollercoster but I know I did the right thing. I deserved better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "I think you did the right thing. This person was obviously not your friend and probably didn\u2019t care for you the same way you cared for them. I had the same situation happen to me. I moved states and someone who I had been friends with for almost 8 years didn\u2019t think to check on me not once to see how things were going or how I was doing at a time when I needed a friend the most. Based on that I learned they did not value our friendship so I cut them off and learned to be okay with losing people who do not show up and support you. Friends shouldn\u2019t get a pass to just do the bare minimum and think you will stick around when you feel you deserve better. Friends show up and treat your wins like their wins and should be some of your biggest supporters.",

I wish I had the courage to end this earlier at the time I thought because we've been friends for so long I couldn't end the friendship. But then I realised I was hanging around her because I had too. I don't want to be friends with someone who didn't ask how I am. \n\nHow long did it take for you to get through the ending of your friendship? sorry to hear! x",

I felt like I did something wrong that I may not have known about or that I wasn\u2019t good enough to be treated well and supported by this person. I was confused but eventually reached the point of realization that I was the best friend I could be, they just didn\u2019t think of me as strongly. I would see them showing up and supporting other people in our close friend group but I never got that and treatment. I asked them multiple times years before my move that I wanted to work more on our friendship since we only ever hung out in group settings. I was just naive at the time and didn\u2019t realize they just did not care for me. I confided in other people and they assured me that nothing was wrong with me so time eventually healed the wound. Making friends as an adult is hard but I would rather be surrounded by people who care and love me in the same manner than be surrounded by those who keep me around just because",

I just don\u2019t like conflict and my parents are sweet people who generally only made requests that I would say yes to.\n\nSo my wife really wants me to work on saying no (even to her). She wants me to only do things I want to do.\n\nNo joke, what you have described basically is what has happened to me. If I\u2019m in a situation where I want to say NO, where I really don\u2019t want to do something, but I get that feeling of \u201coh fuck it just go with it\u201d... I end up very aggressively saying no.\n\nMy therapist approves, she said it\u2019s good practice for me to say no so strongly. I\u2019m not exactly shouting that nowadays or anything, but especially with family and friends it\u2019ll come off fairly strong. But it\u2019s cool though - at least folks now understand that I have boundaries too!",

A bank will sell your house if you can\u2019t pay the mortgage. And if you play by this book, the relation with that person is the collateral.  It is why you were willing to lend the money. And you will lose it if the money is not paid back.\n\nAssuming you are lending money you can do without anyway, the risk you are taking is not a financial one, but social.\n\nIf you are giving loans of money you need, there is a whole other problem.

Just my wife and my parents.\n\nShe couldn't tell her mother because she gets bitter that we make good money (instead of being happy for us). It really sucks how success makes a lot of people feel negatively toward you.",

Something that has really helped is creating a framework that I'm comfortable giving loans.  I will only loan money to people who don't already owe me money. I only loan money between $0 and $xx.  I will not chase people down, and I don't want money to come between relationships - for me this has been the best way to make sense of it all.",

I'm sorry you can't say anything but I'm glad you at least go to tell us. Congrats!!\n\nBy the way, if you're able, try putting away half of that 30% difference into your savings or 401k. Since you haven't gotten use to having the extra money yet, you won't miss it. And you'll be shocked by how much you can start accumulating in such a short time. A friend gave me that tip a while ago and I already have a pretty hefty 401k even though I'm only in my 30s. That's money I'll be using for a brand new car and a house later on.",

    "postText": "He is such a fucking asshole, an annoying, idiotic, rude person and he very clearly hates me and openly tries to irritate me and make me feel miserable. \n\nThe other people in my friend group definitely seem to like him more than they like me. This is my only group of friends and it\u2019s getting to the point where I just can\u2019t stand to be around this person. So now I feel like I just have to leave the group, and if that happens, I\u2019ll basically have no one. I\u2019ll just be trapped in my own world and all of the miserable shit that\u2019s happening in my personal life.",

Once you cut ties with these people, you'll create space to welcome better-quality friends that will uplift you.\n\nFinding good friends takes time. People come in and out of our lives to teach us different lessons. Trust me, spending time alone is better than being around miserable people.",

And I\u2019m in a small town area too so there\u2019s not even a lot of options even if I were normal. Plus I do really like the group without him, it\u2019s just he infects everything and makes it awful.\n\nThis is also an extremely difficult time in my personal life and spending time with this group is basically my only escape. But he has basically ruined that.",

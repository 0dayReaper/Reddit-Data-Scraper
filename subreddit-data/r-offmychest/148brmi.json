    "postText": "I literally always plan out entire trips and have to assign them tasks to help me plan and follow up with them because they won\u2019t remember. I\u2019ll write out itineraries and reach out to everyone and pick the date, but I recently decided after my most recent trip that I\u2019m tired of planning all the time so I withdrew significantly and our friend group doesn\u2019t do much anymore. \n\nHowever one of my roommates who\u2019s in the friend group asked if we could do a boat party. I\u2019m like yeah sure but you guys need to plan bc it\u2019s your idea and I\u2019ll be out of the country for half a month plus I always plan everything, which they agreed to. Also she doesn\u2019t work or go to school full time while I work full time as well. But then while I\u2019m out of the country right now there was no planning at all according to one of my friends and looks like these plans aren\u2019t going to happen. Just incredibly frustrating having to be the planner even for things my friends want to do.",

    "postText": " \nHi, first of all I am not eloquent enough to deliver this smoothly so please bear with me. You see we never really had good relationship with my mother's relatives or if there's any (for context, I am asian so family is a big thing) because I grew up knowing there's a feud and of course as a young child I would hate on them too and would side by my family at all times. But now as I've come to see new perspectives, I think understand them. We as family don't talk much, not because we don't like each other but that's how we are, we are naturally silent. So I don't know if there are other underlying issues. But the main issue of the feud would be my father, they didn't like my father for my mother because he doesn't have a job and he \"used\" to gamble a lot. When I viewed this as young me, of course I was upset, like why do they care, they love each other so what? But now, I don't know, because it's not like my mother proved them wrong either ( not like she has to prove something but you know a good slap in the face would've been satisfying) because right now, we are in a fucking huge debtssssss, he still doesn't have a job, and it's not like he's a  house husband either, my mother still do chores, sure my father run some errands but my mom do all chores every weekend and would still clean even on weekdays. And lastly, this is what makes realize things, I feel so bad for not noticing it earlier but, it's not like he treats my mom the best either, it's not anything domestic violence but like again, we are naturally silent but he would always blame my mom a lot so it may be small to others but for me I feel bad for her. What made me write this is because he has some trouble in his health and it is because he's not taking care of himself, he knew some foods are bad for him but here we are. I'm just frustrated bcs my siblings have a lot of needs, tuitions (we are already in college btw) and rents. And my mother's job doesn't earn a lot either so that sums it all up. I know I should be grateful for having a complete family, even though my family's struggling they were still able to send us to college but I just can't help to think that maybe they were right.",

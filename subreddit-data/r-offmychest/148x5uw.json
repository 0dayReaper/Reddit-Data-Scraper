    "postText": "I know I know the title may sound a little alarming BUT BARE WITH ME HAHA.\n\nLast night i go into work, with the idea of physically saying goodbye to a friend that\u2019s going to Hawaii (like permanently) and so, not thinking too much of it, I clock in and a sweet gf/coworker of mine asks me if I\u2019m free after work. I get excited because I\u2019m like omg yes girly time! I ask her what and with who is the plan. She mentions that it's not our usual friend group, but people from work. (I've hanged with some people outside of work and let's just say, I can tell when I'm not wanted or when I just need to be alone alone yk?) So I cringe at the idea but I ask her again: what and with who (from work)? She mentioned it's bowling and mentions a few people and I start to get excited thinking \"Hey, it'll be fun! I've never really had adults play bowling with me maybe it's a good idea!\" until she mentions *His* name. \n\n(We'll call him L) (Context: A coworker I had a big crush on and one night (my first time out with people from work) we nearly hook up but I mention that I don't want it to be a one time thing, I want us to actually start talking a little seriously and he tells me he can't date anyone as he wants to focus on \"school\" speech. A few months later, a person from my past reaches out to me and I (admit sadly I lost my mind that day) reach out to L (Because he said \"I don't usually date co workers and I need to focus on school\") because I just wanted to be around someone (I thought at the time okay @-@) chill to talk and drink with. Truth be told though, I did have the motive to continue what we we're doing the first time we went out) We hook up (yes drunk both of us lmao) and he acts different than the first night (First night: cuddling, kissing me, holding my hand, actually seeming romantic and normal, held me in his sleep and would say nice things to me) (Second night: fell asleep right after he finished, was grumpy when woken up and didn't want to have pillow talk like the last time as well as angry when the lube burned me when he was awake enough to go for another round, and hence starts the next part: the fight) (We fight, he tells me \"You want something serious, I can't provide that. Don't settle for me ____. So I drive home, and can barely keep it together for the next shifts that follow. He tries to make me jealous by chatting up a girl that has trash talked me and would stare at me at work, sometimes pass by me more often than before.) (The last thing was me and this girl talking and (he's a server) she started talking to him (didn't think much of it) till he stopped his work and actually stood and started talking and talking to her...in the manner we once did. That I had the biggest ick and had to play around with my watch before walking to the bathroom to calm down. He was giving her the same smile and enthusiasm he would give me (when we we're friendly/flirting) that I had a feeling it was to piss me off because I was quite literally, a few inches away from her and just standing there like ???) (Still NC since March 24th) \n\nBACK to the main story sorry, had to give a bit of the back story. \nSo I tell her I'm not sure that I should go since he (and the other girl) are going to be there and it would be so late at night. She pleads (and she usually isn't the type) and asks me to go, that it would be a lot of fun and to ignore him, that I'm \"a baddie. and He's regretting it.\" I laugh and say I will see by the end of my shift and jus try to focus on my work. But I couldn't. I started zoning out bad and feeling my stomach hurt that it felt like my gut was literally telling me something bad may happen, I shouldn't go. When the time nearly rolled around, I was finishing my training with a new hire, I didn't even see when but L was behind the bar, helping the bartender (They both we're going to the event and it was nearly that time to meet everyone up) that I felt even more sick. I could only think of how I was my mom was still here and that if I could ask her for advice... I'm atheist (God's let me down a lot spare me lol) I prayed to my mom that if she could speak to mem through the friend I was going to meet up with. To tell me some words of wisdom and what I could hold onto. I was pretty much on straight auto piolet that I didn't even realize I was at my Hawaii friends house until the directions stopped. I parked the car and got out and we spoke. It was refreshing! She made me laugh and actually feel calm, I was no longer sweating or shaking like earlier that I could meet her family and not feel uneasy. (I have a fear/bitterness with meeting families cus of my mom gone and my dad behind his bipolar self and my disowned sister and my sister being all I reallllly have left besides my pets) It was nice talking to her family about disney world and how neat it is that I asked them how they feel with her leaving. They were honest and kind, giving that feedback that they we're ready for her happiness and to be in her corner if she needed them. And (she was saying goodbye to her grandparents) when she came back I asked her, why Hawaii? and why now? She said something that legit couldn't stop playing in my mind. \"I need to make myself uncomfortable. I have to be independent again. I have to get out there and get better.\" And then it slowly hit me. \n\nAll these shifts, of looking at him, hoping he was looking at me. All these nights, of trying to forget his smile and the words he would tell me. All these days I would daydream my heart out that I would believe he could be any different... it slowly clicked. \nI had texted my work friend/gf that I wasn't going because I wasn't ready to see him nor did I feel okay but I quickly asked for the address and told her I was coming to say hi and grab a drink (at the bar at the bowling alley) And told the Hawaii friend I had to go. She hugged me (we both have similar mental illness symptoms so she understands my repetitive tendencies) and she told me that if I were to go, I just go and hang out with my friend and go home. Not to go see L and go home with him. that in the end... I truthfully was just another body conquer. And so I did just that.\nI started driving on 95, going as fast as I could (legally) and enjoy the newfound adrenaline and confidence in my veins. 3/4ths on the way, I get a text from the friend of a new meet up point (an ihop lol) and a call from another friend (that was there that night, he's also important. We'll call him H) to meet at a bar (so two different locations) nearby the bowling alley. I call the friend to check if they're going (They can't, they're 20 and didn't want to risk getting ID'd so they tell me they're going home and to hang out soon BUT \"go have a fun time please. Don't let anything stop you and go enjoy it.\" so with a sinking heart, I U-turn and head to the bar).\n\nI arrive at the bar, and it's dead. For a minute, I think everyone's gone and it was a prank just to get me to drive to a 30 min bar (away from my house lol) I call H and he tells me that they're all in the back, to come and say hello. (Still in my hostess clothing lolll) I take a deep breath, and slowly make my way back there, airpods blasting and all (It's what keeps me focused loll) and I see a good bunch of people from work, with L lingering around. I struggle to keep my cool, as (Yes, they're friendly and say hello but ik when the vibe is off and I'm like drained socially that I was like ok I'm staying for a while then going to sleep) I see him and (probably noticed my arrival either by seeing me or by name) I go to hug H, tell him \"Just came back from seeing ____.\" They go \"No way! Where?\" etc etc etc talking and we move to another part of the bar (with everyone) and two boys (one is a good friend too, we will call him M) overhear and one of them asks if she's coming. I say no, \"she needs to finish packing, her flight's in a few hours\" but they insist, drunkly begging for her number. and after a while, I cave and give it and they call her, somehow manage to convince her to come and now I'm even more happier. I started to notice everyone was starting to play pool (there's like sections to the bar) so M and another two boys start to head back to the main room to play beer pong. I decide to follow them as I can see L is not looking at me (At least that's what I felt) I feel bitter for a minute, like \"wtf? I look so pretty, this is out element. We're chilling with co workers and I mean... we're here. Why won't he talk to me?\" but then I remembered the Hawaii friend's words. To go to have fun for myself, not to see him. So I turned up the music and started to cheer on the guys, even if it meant getting myself attention from the other room, I wanted to make sure I was having a good time, and that everyone could tell. Shortly after, I leave the room to call the Hawaii friend to check on her ETA and saw nobody was at the beer table so I was forced to go back to the back of the bar. I didn't want to sit where everyone was playing pool cus nobody was even trying to talk to me (I was mainly there till the friend would arrive then leave with her) so I bought one drink (proud of myself, didn't want to go overboard like in the past) and did everything to stay positive (listening to music and looking at interest) \n\nSo (finally HWAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR reading wise) I'm at the bar, sitting with my drink and H comes up to talk to me (to check on me because he learned about a long story short about me and L) and we joke, talk and just have a good time as always. He goes back to the pool table (after about 5-10 mins of talking) and I keep at it with interest until M comes over and sits in my area, saying he needs a beer and starts talking to me too. (So rn it's only me and M) And it was a blast! We got to joke, just chat and it felt nice to catch up and enjoy the vibe with him. Shortly, H comes back and he gets a seat next to me and all three of us are talking, taking sips from each other's drinks and THEN IT HAPPENS.\n\nI have my eyes trained on both of the boys until I see someone walking behind M, and it's a familiar face. It's L. My breath was shaky, but I managed to keep myself looking at both boys, ignoring how he stood behind M for a short bit, (I think said something to him in a whisper? because then) HE PULLS THE CHAIR NEXT TO M AND SITS DOWN, DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM ME. (It's hard to explain but the seating at this point is like a 90 degree triangle and he is pretty much in my area now.) Me, repeating the friend's words, I keep my eyes and conversation on these two boys and I keep my peripheral checking on L's actions every now and then. He shifts his body (for the first half) of the conversation towards M (and me and H but yk he's sitting next to M) and seems to be listening in on us, just sitting there in silence and hearing all three of us converse. And this goes on for a good 15 minutes, H and M and me talking while he stays quiet, listening and (I could have sworn I caught him looking at me once) because It seemed at some points, when it was just H and M talking, and me listening or changing a song, he would shift his body again (like fidgeting) seeming like he wanted to speak to me (in front of them).\nSoon after, he moves his body back to the bar (like not to us anymore) orders his drink and walks away. \n\nThe night ends with me telling Hawaii friend and her proud of me for standing my ground and \"making myself uncomfortable\" but warned me to be careful in the future. That in the case (cus she also thinks he's regretting letting me go and he was sitting there for so long for a reason) he tries to pursue/win me over; it's just his game. That she asked M (she jokes saying \"I had to make sure he was rlly drunk so I could get the truth outta him) what they think about L and they all said (to put it short) that he's a fuck boy.\nand if I've learned anything from my past relationships, You can't teach that old type of dog new tricks.\nI'd like to hope that a miracle can happen between us, but I feel like I also have to be aware that, this is who he is. He sat down and stayed for a reason, but I also deserve to be fought after (like I tried fighting for him). I deserve communication and dedication. And if for some reason, a miracle can't happen between us, I just hope I can finally have the \"take me back\" moment. Because I'll never forget that night where I sat there... naked and on the edge of tears with his \"Don't settle for me.\" after cuddling with me hours prior. I'll never forget the shame and the burning anger that came after that night so last night, I finally could say I won. I stood in the face of fear and put my foot down. I finally could show someone that once meant a lot to me and took advantage of it, that I'm truly irreplaceable.",

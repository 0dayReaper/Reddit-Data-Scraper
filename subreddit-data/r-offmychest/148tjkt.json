    "postText": "I\u2019m 5 months pregnant (20F) I just finished my fifth semester at college as a biochem major. I found out I was pregnant and my bf(23M) at the time wanted me to keep it because he\u2019s \u201cMuslim and it\u2019s against my religion.\u201d He promised to help raise it and we would get a place to live together. He promised to take care of all the apartment costs. I\u2019m taking a leave of absence of school, and planned to work my internship this summer. I had to go to the hospital 2 days ago from overexerting myself while moving a bunch of heavy things by myself, and was having cramps and some bleeding. Since my pregnancy, I been having pains and health issues, I can\u2019t really work anymore. Today, we were talking about signing a lease to an apartment. He expects me to pay 50/50 for the rent while paying for our groceries and everything else. He works full time and makes more money than me. I told him he\u2019s being selfish, he said that the whole pregnancy is my fault and I made his life 100x harder. Keep in mind, I barely seen him my entire pregnancy. He went to 1 doctor appointment. He promised to take me grocery shopping because I can\u2019t carry a lot of heavy things (I live in NYC far from home). Then he never came to go with me. When the air quality was hazardous here, I couldn\u2019t go out and I had no food.  He said its my fault I kept the baby, while keep in mind he was against abortion in the first place. He never told me that he has a suspended license, he\u2019s been booked in jail before, and he lied about his income. I found out all of this months into my pregnancy. He told me I should just move back home with my parents out of state. I just wish he was honest from the jump but now I\u2019m stuck here in nyc by myself. My lease ends in 2 weeks, I have to try to get new insurance back at home if I move back and find a new prenatal doctor. I\u2019m just so stressed out and disappointed. I feel like I had to make a lot of sacrifices including school, while he hasn\u2019t done anything. He won\u2019t even tell his family.",

            "comment": "If he hasn't told his family, you have to wonder if he is planning to be around for the long haul. He may have had romantic ideas of taking care of you when he convinced you to have the baby and promised to take care of the costs, but when the time came to live up to those responsibilities those ideas faded.   \nSince you already know he has issues with honesty, don't accept promises of child support. Go to court and have them determine the amount so that they will be able to enforce it, or get a legal contract signed.",

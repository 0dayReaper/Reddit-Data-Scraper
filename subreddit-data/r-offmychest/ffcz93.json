    "postText": "I found out last week that my cancer is progressing faster than was previously thought. I thought I had some years, maybe a decade left. I have 2 years, maybe 5, now. I won't see my kids graduate high school or college, find real love or find themselves, and I'll never meet my grandkids. I've made peace with it - to some extent, but an accelerated timeline took me quite by surprise.\n\nLove your families, fellow Redditors. Life is short and sometimes cruel.\n\nTldr: fuck cancer, but good.",

They're really important to her, though, and honestly they're important to me and other family members, too. No one has digitized them yet (I'm working on it), so they don't get shared around, and now I barely remember my grandmother's voice and I can't remember my grandfather's at all.

Went to California, failed to get my MA, went to Texas, got my MA, but couldn't find work and went into education and hated it.\n\nAfter three years of hunting for archaeological/museum jobs while finishing my degree and teaching, I decided I was too unhappy to continue as I had been and widened my net.\n\nI'm now a CAD drafter (thanks to all the GIS/computing/programming/databases classes I took) and so much happier.\n\nArchaeology is a shitshow.  It's racist, clique-y, grad programs celebrate those that squish their classmates on the way to to the top, and ruthlessly exploit everyone for their own gain.  Look at those protests out in California where the grad students were striking for a living wage and 70 of them got fired, some of which now have their visa statuses in jeopardy because of said firings.\n\nIf you still want to do it, get a double-major that will be a safety net at the undergrad level.  GIS (Geographic Information Sciences), programming, computer science, databases, education, business; something versatile that you can use elsewhere.\n\nWhile you're an undergrad, get every internship (museums, archaeological labs, public outreach) that you can, and DO SOMETHING EVERY SUMMER. You will need at least one paid dig (that is, a field school in the summer that you pay a minimum of $2,000 for - mine was over $4,000) on your resume to get into grad school.  \n\nJoin clubs too.  Pad the hell out of your resume.\n\nThen go to grad school.  If you don't get funding, don't go.  You can apply for a PhD right away, or do a MA/MS (depending on the program) and then a PhD. When you're applying to grad school, remember that while programs are important, you're looking for a chair (professor in charge of your career) that you can work with.\n\nGET EVERYTHING IN WRITING.  I did not, and it's a huge reason why I had to leave California empty-handed.\n\nOnce you've found a chair that you can work with, get accepted, and have funding, you need to come up with an original idea (usually a program will \"assign\" you something to start looking at) and do research while taking a full courseload and probably teaching undergrads at the same time.  While in grad school you also need to be in at least one club, preferably as leadership to show your personal progression.\n\nMake sure you stay in regular contact with at least six professors from your education history for letters of recommendation - they can't write them if they don't remember you.  You need to learn how to apply for grants and funding, both for yourself and any projects you want to run for your thesis/dissertation.\n\nBe judicious in choosing which area of the world you want to work in. When I was an undergrad, I met dozens of grad students whose degrees were curtailed or dropped because they couldn't do field work in Egypt/the Middle East because of the Arab Spring.  (Especially the women.) Australian sites and Californian ones were just destroyed this past year in wildfires.  Sites in the midwest are now off limits because the current US government has gutted the Bureau of Land Management.  And archaeological conferences are being canceled as we speak, as well as field schools around the world thanks to coronavirus.\n\nAlso, join at least one professional society - Society of American Archaeology (just had a massive scandal protecting the right of a sexual predator to remain at a conference over the right of his victim to not be harassed), Society for Historical Archaeology, etc etc.  They have conferences at least once a year, you must go (generally you need to pay out of pocket \\[I never paid less than $1,000 between room with roommates, flights, food, fees, etc\\] and sometimes get reimbursed part of it) and present your research every year.  Use this opportunity to network and find people also studying what you're studying, and start forming relationships with the companies who also attend.  There's a massive drinking culture, so make sure you play along, but don't get so drunk people remember you as the drunk one. \n\nIf you have any mental health issues, make sure you take care of those along the way.  I was in therapy for years trying to undo the damage grad school did/was doing to me, and I had to do it in secret because the department made no bones about not wanting \"weak\" students.  I was particularly disliked because I insisted on going to visit my family every Christmas and summer and scheduled my field work around those trips.  I also publicly took off every Saturday night for myself, another huge no-no, and preferred studying in the privacy of my home to the discomfort of the department library.\n\nI had a uniquely awful graduate experience, and I honestly love archaeology more now that I'm not doing it as a career and I can just read about it and glory in what's being done without suffering within the culture as a failure.  Plenty of my classmates would tell you that as long as you work hard and take care of business everything will be great.\n\nBut that wasn't my experience, and I won't lie to make myself sound better - or archaeology, as much as I love the \\*idea\\* of archaeology.",

We were assured by her doctors that she would make it through the birth of her first grandchild, through the holidays, and at least several months into the next year. She died two months before my daughter was born. I have a little sister who was hoping that mom would live to see her become a teenager. She turned 13 two weeks after mom passed. It was hard, of course. Even though we knew it was coming we were devastated by all the things she was missing, especially in the first year or two. But mom left community behind. She left friends, and family, and US. And so we had all of that. We had each other, and all of those connections, and memories, and support, and love. My mom didn't come to the hospital to help me through nursing my newborn daughter, but a friend of hers I'd never even met made a point to. That woman has watched my kids grow for five years now. My baby sister hasn't had our mom through starting highschool, starting to date, or applying for college, but she has older siblings who have rallied around her and taken on that load. \n\nYour family is going to miss you terribly. But speaking from the other side of this, as a child whose parent died of cancer sooner than we anticipated: we knew it was coming. We prepared as best we could. And in the end we had more of our mom left than we thought we would. I hope the next couple of years with your family are full of love and warmth.\n\n\nEdit: I also want to second what someone said about videos. The one video we have left of our mother talking is precious to us. We don't have any other recordings of her voice.",

By the time they found out she was sick it was already stage 4 and she only had 2 years with us. She fought the entire time. My one regret from that time is that we kids were kept in the dark. We knew mom was sick but no one really told us she was dying and for the last few weeks we weren't even allowed to see her. The day she died me and my sister were in school. She died at 8 in the morning and no one  told us until 2:30 that afternoon. We were completely blindsided because we didn't know how sick she was. I still get angry thinking about it because we never got a chance to say good bye or come to terms with what was going to happen. It's one of the single greatest regrets I have that she died without us having seen her for weeks before hand. It feels like we got robbed somehow of that little bit of time. Fuck cancer. I don't know how old your kids are, but if I may suggest it, don't make the same decision my parents did. Don't hide what's happening from your kids at the end to try to spare them. It just leaves loose ends and regrets. Getting to say I love you before you go is worth everything.",

I have a strong support network of living friends and family - all of whom know.\n\nSecond, I bought a good life insurance policy when I was younger and much healthier that ensures my kids are going to college debt-free, my wife will have the house free and clear, and if she's frugal she won't have to work while the kids are growing up. I can't tell you how much peace of mind that adds - knowing my wife and kids won't struggle because the primary bread-winner is gone.\n\nThird, I've never had much existential fear. I tend to put things into buckets of Deal with Now and Deal with Later. Having a strong pragmatic streak helps. But the toughest part has been convincing myself to be more emotionally available to my loved ones. I tend to not give emotions much weight, so I've had to learn how to be available, open, and authentic. That's been difficult!",

I know this isn\u2019t a thread asking for advice, but I thought I might be able to share a few things that I really wish I was able to get from my mom before she died. She was so determined to beat the cancer that when I asked her for certain things she would brush it off. \n\nWrite a letter to each of your children. It can be about anything you want to say, things you want them to know. Memories or jokes or hopes for their future. I read notes and birthday cards that my mom wrote to me over and over, even eleven years later. I treasure them above all things. \n\nPass on things they can only get from you - your recipes, your life pro tips, memories from your childhood or stories they can\u2019t get from anyone but you. There are so many things I wish I could ask my mom but will never get the answer to. \n\nTake videos of yourself! Or voice recordings, anything. My mom passed in 2009 which was right around the time iPhones became a thing, so I have very few videos of her or us together. Hearing her laugh and her voice is literally the best sound in the world to me now.\nYour kids will cherish these forever! \n\nI\u2019m so so sorry you\u2019re going through this. I want you to know that as hard as this will be for your kids, they will be okay.",

While you're still here, the best you can do is too really live life to the fullest, the weight of knowing how limited time is really becomes real now. Absolute best of all wishes you're able to really live out however much time you have, life moves way too fast sometimes, so it's important to embrace what's left while possible",

I really hope there is something after this (I personally think we just float around as ghosts or reincarnate).",

Knowing my family is financially cared for HUGELY helped the depression and anxiety that followed my diagnosis.",

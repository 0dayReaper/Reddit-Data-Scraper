    "postText": "Me (18f) and (20M) boyfriend have been together for 2 years and it\u2019s been rocky and it\u2019s been hard and it\u2019s gotten once to the point that he did not love me anymore. Despite all of this now we\u2019re planning on moving in together in 2 weeks and we\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time together. \n\nI have to get this off my chest that\nI don\u2019t find him unbearable and I love his personality, I\u2019ve seen his flaws, I\u2019ve met the bad side and I\u2019ve met the good and considering it\u2019s gotten past the honeymoon phase I feel now that I\u2019m accepting him completely as someone I love.\nWe have similar values and ideas in life but I worry that one day we\u2019ll grow apart JUST BECAUSE or we\u2019ll stop loving each other JUST BECAUSE. I can\u2019t stand the idea because he is so prominent in my life, it\u2019s not that I think I\u2019ll be alone forever or that I\u2019ll never find someone who loves me, but no guy will ever amount to him, I don\u2019t think I will ever love someone as MUCH as I love him. No guy will ever amount to him even if I hated him, I would still cry for nights on end and my heart would be broken, I\u2019d get back up but the pain of losing him as my love is so scary. \n\nI\u2019ve messed up before and he\u2019s accepted me back and I know he will not ever again. But seeing videos and texts of people that broke up because they \u201cweren\u2019t working out\u201d is fing scary, I have a NEED to secure my spot as his woman even if we did break up for a while, I\u2019d be waiting for him to come back. \nI need to know that we will always be together and I can\u2019t accept anything else. \nGod please HELP ME",

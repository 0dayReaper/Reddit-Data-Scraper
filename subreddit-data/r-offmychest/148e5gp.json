    "postText": "Throwaway because you never know. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve been encouraged to share my feelings with my parents after years of dismissiveness and emotional neglect. \n\nThe problem with doing that is they share feelings back, and my mother in particular wants us to start talking more often. \n\nI genuinely just don\u2019t know if I want to. I don\u2019t want to hurt her, but I\u2019m not sure if I particularly like her. \n\nThe selfish reason I haven\u2019t gone full NC is I am relying on their inheritance. I understand that might come across as entitled or selfish, but after a ton of emotional needs unmet, having some financial needs met feels like compensation somehow? \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. It feels so wrong to say you don\u2019t love your mother, but there\u2019s so much hurt on my side and any attempts to address it are going to painful for her. \n\nI don\u2019t know who else to talk to about this and figured I\u2019d just vent here.",

But trying to get to know your mom on another level with other expectations may help. When you go at it with wanting to get to know her and her side as a person better and not as your mom, it may works better. You can set boundaries and the direction.",

At least you get one thing from them eventually that can help you eventually, in which way you\u2019ll need it then. And if it\u2019s just to go on vacations or parties. Just make sure you don\u2019t rock yourself down bc of the money. If you need someone to talk to, I\u2019m here. Feel free to dm",

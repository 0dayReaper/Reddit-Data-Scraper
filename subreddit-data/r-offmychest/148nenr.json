    "postText": "For the past while, I (17F) have been on my mental health journey and trying to do what is best for me. Looking at the people in my life I realize just how blind I've been to blatant mistreatment but as it's what I've surrounded myself by for years, I don't know what to do.\n\n  \nReally it's all just venting since I no longer have any kind of unbiased source to tell.\n\n  \nMy late dad's side of the family has been pushing me off for as long as I can remember. They were always together at some kind of gathering yet never bothered to invite my sister and me. They would mainly invite us when my dad was in town. (My parents were divorced but my dad lived far due to work) That behavior has transpired into my treatment (or lack thereof) to this day. Now, my 20-something-year-old cousins choose blatant favoritism with other, younger, cousins. They're always posting about their little hangouts with everyone but me. It is just so painfully obvious too. I don't really get acknowledged for quite literally anything. When I do get invited, I feel alienated and that they don\u2019t really have true conversations with me like they do each other. It just stings because as a kid, that's where I'd always want to be. with them. As a kid, I cried at a lot of parties I did get invited to knowing I wouldn't see them for a while again. After my dad had passed, they had promised to try more and that \"we'll get through this together\". They SLIGHTLY did at first but now it's just back at stage 1. The only one who had made some effort to include us still is my stepmom, who even they judge.\n\n  \nA similar thing would go to my sorry excuses of \"friends\". There have just been many instances of being made fun of for things such as my skin, race, and even my dad's passing that I just let slide because \"oh, they're my friends, they would never hurt me\". oh, I was wrong. Even with them I still get left out. They have all these nicknames and inner gossip with each other but when I try to know just to understand since it\u2019s all they talk about (other than K-pop, which I don\u2019t listen to and they make me not want to, and complain about something or someone in their lives) they just don\u2019t bother to tell me like I\u2019m some kind of hassle yet will eagerly tell each other. If anything I\u2019m like some source of entertainment to them. My relationship is something for them to make fun of and they have always been quick to judge my boyfriend since I was barely even talking to him. I had to go through a lot of drama at the beginning of my relationship, going up to friends who were \u201cconcerned\u201d and \u201cworried\u201d about me and telling them that it was fine whereas others who had been talking to many different guys and have countless boy drama be met with nothing but support. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll truly understand anything from my point of view even if I were to say anything. If I were to just leave out of nowhere, then they would question it and drama would ensue. (Also, it\u2019s not all of them, it\u2019s just the majority and the main ones I\u2019m actively hanging out with.)\n\n  \nI had been aware of this all for a long time now yet I chose to do nothing to avoid the pain, thinking it would all get better if I kept trying. But I don\u2019t think I should bother at this point. The main reason I even do anything about this is my boyfriend just bringing it straight up to my face albeit in a hurtful way but it\u2019s a big wake-up call and I know it was not his intention. It probably is just petty drama but it just feels like it consumed my whole life. I\u2019m just tired and don\u2019t know how to go about anything anymore.",

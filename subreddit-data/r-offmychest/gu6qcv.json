I was raised in a racist household but Im realizing theres no reason to hate every group of people that is different than me. We bleed the same color of blood. I just don\u2019t have a reason to hate people I don\u2019t know. Most of the problems I have encountered in my life were by my own race. There\u2019s literally no reason for me to hate somebody I don\u2019t even know. \n\nI want do things to help people now. Don\u2019t know how though.",

My dads racist (he says he\u2019s not but he is) he always pulls the \u201cI\u2019m not racist I have black friends\u201d but drops the N word all the time and calls them thugs.\n\nAnyhow I always thought it was normal- I said the N word too- jokingly, in songs, etc. \n\nThen I had a black professor who encouraged us to go to an event about oppression. I went and I cried. I never understood what people of color go through, and I never will, but I did understand that the way I acted needed to stop. I understood that it hurts others and it isn\u2019t even rational thinking. I had lead a sheltered life until I got to college. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to change! It\u2019s ok to be less ignorant and fear your past while doing it. \n\nToday I handed out waters to the protestors in my city. I\u2019ve come a long way, and I\u2019m really proud of that. You should be too! I\u2019m ashamed of the way I used to be as well- but I\u2019m working towards bettering myself for others and that\u2019s all that matters. \n\nIt\u2019s the beginning of a new era \u2764\ufe0fcongratulations",

I thought how fucking ridiculous this violence and property damage is and fear a young person will look  at this majority black crowd and think that the majority of black people act like these rioters.  A small fraction of any race is criminal. If a person is racist you can not force them not to be. You can only show them how similar and overwhelmingly good all races are. You can't force someone to stop thinking a race is inferior. I can try to present facts that show that white people are not inferior atheletes.",

In fact, the more subtle and casual you can be about it, the better. \n\nThe advantage that you have as a white person that used to be racist is that you have the same background as people who are racist. \n\nWhile people who are on the fence and just have ambivalent feelings are the ones who have a chance at redemption. There are those who are older and just stuck in their ways and it\u2019s a very important part of their identity to be racist because it reinforces their identity. \n\nNow you can\u2019t convert anyone who doesn\u2019t want to and honestly you can argue till you\u2019re blue in the face and nothing changes. \n\nSo my advice is not to act indignant and just go to the complete extremes of social justice warrior. You\u2019re not and you don\u2019t need to be. An average white person who can express concern about this issue can be more powerful than a lifelong black activist because racists have tuned the activists out a long time ago.\n\nIf they see someone like you who has changed their mind and also grew up in a similar situation or neighborhood, your words will have more impact on them.",

Additionally, I'm listening to an audiobook of So You Want to Talk about Race, which is also a good starting point for people that want to do better and have conversations, but maybe don't know where to start.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or want to talk more about this!",

After the encounter ended, I remember being struck by the realization that he was actually just a boy, probably about 15, and I felt so ashamed of my response. This was about the time that Trayvon Martin died. I had recently read about a study that said that people judge young black men to be older and more threatening than they actually are... and I realized that was exactly what I did. In the first couple seconds of the encounter, I didn\u2019t see a child. I saw a threat.

Family friends teachers people in public. SHUT THAT SHIT DOWN. \n\nKeeping quiet and looking away when these things happen is to let that person get away with hate and bullying which encourages it in other people! \n\nThings you can say:\n-Wow thats racist\n-Wow thats hateful\n-I dont get it, can you explain what you meant? (And then dig further to why they called a certain race or person that name and why they would make assumptions and hateful comments about someone they don't know. Do not laugh. Do not encourage.)\n-im not going to sit here and listen to [hateful xyz thing]\n-im really disappointed to hear you say that\n-I thought you were better than that\n\n\"It's not enough to be nonracist. We must be ANTI-RACIST \"\n\n\"If you are neutral in situations of injustive, you have chosen the side of the opressor!\"",

My advice is to be open to the challenging situations you will run into that will cause you to further question things and grow, as long as you can acknowledge those situations for what they are... An apology goes a long way, and being defensive can have a negative effect. \n\nI awkwardly apologized a couple years ago for some stereotyping words said to a coworker. I felt like an idiot, but I\u2019m always going to be learning. The apology needed to be made, so I did what I could when I realized my mistake. We\u2019re all figuring things out with the cards we were drawn. My goal is to keep being the best that I can be, and learn from new experiences/knowledge as they come up.",

You may have broken from the ideology but you will continue to benefit from it whether you like it or not. But to realize your own prejudices, as you've done, transforms behaviors of discrimination to acts of understanding. Thank you for sharing and sparking a little hope people can change.",

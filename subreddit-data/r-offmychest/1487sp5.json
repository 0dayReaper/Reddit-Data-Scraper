The wealthy and corporations love him for lowering their taxes while the working and middle class love that they actually understand what he\u2019s talking about. I listened to an interview today and I thought hell yeah! He may not be as well educated as our previous presidents and he is ignorant, but he knows what to say to his demographics and how to say it. \n\nPlease don\u2019t underestimate him again in 2024.",

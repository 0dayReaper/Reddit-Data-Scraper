    "postText": "But she just doesn\u2019t want me. It\u2019s always been that way. No matter what I asked for, even a hug, I was pushed away because she had already spend time with my brother, she said she didn\u2019t want to spend any time with me. She\u2019s with my brother most days of the week, when she\u2019s home she\u2019s either for my dad, or on her phone. I can\u2019t ask for help with anything, I know even asking makes her respond angry. I don\u2019t even have to bother to sit next to her. She keeps saying she wishes she had more time for me, or that when she can finally spend less time with my brother she\u2019ll finally has time for me. I\u2019ve been waiting to have a parent for so long, I\u2019m tired. \nI need some advice right now, but I can\u2019t ask people online for this. I don\u2019t even know how to try to ask her. I know I always have to do everything alone, it\u2019s fine, but at these moments it hurts.",

    "postText": "Throwaway as some mutual friends follow my main. Also mobile so formatting.\n\nI took over running a sports club I have now been in for over ten years a couple of years ago. I have met a lot of people through this place and consider a lot of them close friends. Well, as people do, a couple of people had a falling out, which is never fun among friends. A couple of us were working to either patch stuff up or at least get them to a point of tolerating each other when my now very ex friend and some of his family who are also in the club decided to use the opportunity to get me to kick out people they don't like. All the people involved in this have been in the club as long as I have or longer, and it seems some jealousy was going on.\n\n\nMy honest assessment of what was going on really was that these people wanted to keep control of how food at the club was done, because it gave them a sense of authority (see: ordering people around and doing fuck all) and felt that the other people were rivals. They started to massively exaggerate the falling out between the other people, saying it was a case of bullying that could potentially even involve the police (it wasn't, someone just made a sarcastic comment too many) and when I shut them down because I was actually trying to deal with it sensibly they unsurprisingly turned on me, and possibly because I decided to get rid of the food side of things and therefore their perceived seat of power.\n\n\nAn aggressive but ineffective series of messages to people in and outside the club got sent, with them trying to convince people I shouldn't be in charge. Things only escalated when they didn't get any responses or the drama they were hoping for (except for seriously upsetting the person they were supposedly campaigning for, who didn't have a clue what they were doing) so they left in as dramatic a way as possible while yelling about courts etc.\n\n\nI am glad it's over and I have been able to block them on everything but I've been feeling like shit. I've never had people acting so illogical towards me and making such a small thing out to be so serious for their own gain. I was several steps ahead of their messaging campaign and was able to take guesses at their plans well enough that I could prepare everyone involved for what they were going to do next so they never got what they wanted, but I've known 2 of these people for over 10 years and thought they were friends so I just feel hurt, which I guess is partly what they wanted",

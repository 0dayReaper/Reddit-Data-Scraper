    "postText": "I'm upset that my boyfriend won't be able to come to my 18th birthday because his family is going to a concert. I went to his 18th birthday, but he won't be able to make it to mine. He's been looking forward to this concert for a while, and I understand that. However, I don't fully trust that he'll make it up to me because he's not great at planning. He couldn't even plan Valentine's Day. \n\nI don't think he fully treats me how I should be treated, but I don't expect too much from a teenage boy. I'm just disappointed that he won't be there for my special day. I know he's trying to make it up to me, but I'm not sure how he'll do that. \n\nI wish he could have planned better and made it to my birthday, but I understand that he has other priorities. I just hope he realizes how important my birthday is to me and makes it up to me in a meaningful way. \n\nOverall, I'm upset that my boyfriend won't be at my 18th birthday, but I understand his reasons for not being able to make it. I just hope he shows me that he cares and makes it up to me in a way that shows he values our relationship. \n\nSide notes to take in why I\u2019m thinking this way- \n\n1: I don't think my boyfriend will put much effort into getting me a gift. Despite our recent conversation where I expressed that all I wanted was a simple flower, he came home the next day with a $50 game card, claiming he didn't have the money for flowers. While I understand he may be short on cash, this behavior makes me feel like he doesn't value my feelings or our relationship.\n\nSlight edit here to this: he even says he would \u201cpick wild flowers for me even if he doesn\u2019t have the money.\u201d Yet he never has. That conversation was the other night and I\u2019ve been fighting for this for nearly 2 years now.\n\n2: My boyfriend has never planned a date for us. I have paid for all the dates except for one, which was the day we ate for free at his parents' restaurant. My boyfriend doesn't enjoy going out to eat because he prefers to cook meals at home. While I appreciate his cooking skills, I do wish he would plan more dates around cooking together. Unfortunately, he has only planned one date centered around cooking, which was on our first year anniversary.\n\nI understand that cooking is his passion and I respect that, but I would like to see more effort put into planning dates that involve cooking together. It would be a fun and intimate way to spend time together, while still indulging in his love for cooking. Hopefully, he will consider this and we can create more special memories centered around our shared love for food. He will always tell me he\u2019ll dog it or plan one. This has been a consistent pattern in our relationship.\n\n3:  My boyfriend has a tendency to prefer staying indoors rather than going out and doing something special. Despite my attempts to plan outings and activities, he often declines and opts to stay in. This behavior is a consistent pattern and has become a source of frustration in our relationship.\n\n4: I have some mild trust issues with my boyfriend that make me slightly worried about him going to this concert. It's not that I don't trust him completely, but there have been a few instances in the past where he hasn't been completely honest with me. I just want to make sure that he's being truthful with me about where he's going and who he's with. I know it sounds like I'm being paranoid, but I just want to make sure that everything is okay.\n\n5: My boyfriend's Valentine's gift this year was a drawing he made of his favorite character. Along with the drawing, he also gave me a hand-written poem, which appeared to be rushed. Despite the rushed nature of the poem, I appreciated the thought and effort he put into the gift.\n\nI hope I\u2019m not sounding selfish, it just hurts a bit knowing he won\u2019t be there and I\u2019m worried for many reasons and many different reasons, I am very sad that we won\u2019t be able to spend the time we planned for my birthday. We wanted to go out of town after my birthday party that weekend and just go out and have fun. I do hope he has a fun time though\u2026 thank you for reading. \n\nI will be logging off this throw away account and logging back onto my main, I\u2019ll log back in later to see if I have anything response. \n\nI hope you have a lovely day, bye bye now.",

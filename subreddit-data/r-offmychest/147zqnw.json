    "postText": "My mom grew up in a very toxic household. Her dad was in and out of her life before committing suicide at 11, she\u2019s had police raid her house as a child, and she grew up in severe poverty. All this to say she never had a foundation for a healthy relationship. She met my dad in college and married after 2 years of dating. She gave up the chance for a masters degree to marry him.\n\nThe problem is my dad was very abusive. Physically, verbally, and mentally. It was hard growing up in a volatile household. My mom told me to call the cops once during a bad argument and my dad snatched the phone out of my hand. I was 6. I\u2019m 23 now and have a pretty close relationship with my mom but it still makes me so angry. Why wouldn\u2019t she leave a man who she saw mistreat her children? I just can\u2019t understand how she could willingly be so weak that she decided to stay with a man like that. I know there\u2019s no logic surrounding abuse victims but it\u2019s so hard, you know? The anger comes in waves and I don\u2019t know what to do. It just hurts that my mom was never strong enough to leave for the safety of both me and my sister.",

    "postText": "For years, I have gravitated towards men because I found them to be funny friends, sweet at times, lovely underneath but as I\u2019ve grown I\u2019ve realized that I genuinely hate men. Every man is flawed so similarly to the rest. A man may be great in private but horrible in public. Or he may have a public persona and a hidden one. Or he may be so sweet, different, your lovely boyfriend, but inside he is angry, and horrible, and mean. I just can\u2019t. I\u2019d like to say i\u2019m biased but every man I have gotten close to has a crazy flaw that is present in majority of them. Idk.",

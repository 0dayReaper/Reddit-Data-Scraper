    "postText": "i'm the top student in my class and there is this guy competing with me. we have a lot of essays and presentations to make and it is just difficult to put effort into each and every single one of the lessons equally. i looked at his essays and thought to myself, just 'how?' 'how could he write such long and informative homeworks?' \n\ni know that i am proud, vain and prejudiced but even i was surprised to find out that he used ai technology to prepare essays for him. i found an application which detects ai writings and compared some of his writings to mine and every single sentence he wrote was found to be ai generated while mine not. \n\nit's unfair not only to me but to everyone in our class. it's just plain wrong and i feel guilty cause my obsession with this department can lead to discoveries like this...",

            "comment": "Your competitive 'obsession' may have led to this discovery but, what you've discovered is pretty bad. If you care about this guy, it may be worth looking up what the plagiarism rules are and maybe warn him what he's setting himself up for. If you were surprised to find out his essays were AI generated, then that suggests to me that you believe he's competent enough to produce work of that quality, it's just the quantity that made you raise an eyebrow and so the AI choice is simply laziness and corner-cutting.\n\nThe other option is to let him fuck about and find out. It's his responsibility at the end of the day. He didn't tell you this or ask you for advice on using AI, so it's not on you to stop him.",

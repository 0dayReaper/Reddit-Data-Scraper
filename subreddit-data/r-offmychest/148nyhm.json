    "postText": "He had the best soul. And a hard life. Before he got to us he lived with someone who didn\u2019t treat him right. He was so traumatised and scared. Even after 5 years with us he was still afraid of every little thing. He was so pure and human. I hope he didn\u2019t suffer a lot. I love him so much. I still can\u2019t believe that he is gone. He was always there for me. I can\u2019t stop crying.\n\nCheetos, I am so sorry. I hope we will meet someday. I miss you already. I love you.",

I miss her all the time. Sometimes, my heart feels so heavy when I miss her, and I cry. Other times, I laugh about silly memories of her. Despite the pain, I'd do it all again if I could. Having a heart dog was the loveliest experience, and I'll treasure all the memories the rest of my life.",

    "postText": "Not sure if this belongs here but here it goes. I came back after 2 years and I saw this hell hole called my old account. God damn, I was very cringe. I made fake \u201cun alive\u201d posts and some karma farming fake first dates. Man I was troubled. I have changed Reddit and I am asking for a redemption. I also had arguments with some guy named u/DevFredDev . His account isn\u2019t there anymore but for the slight slight chance that you\u2019re reading this Fred, you were right I was wrong. I apologize for my actions and I have learned how to actually program. I have made a new account that I will not be sharing since I want a fresh new account. Thank you Fred. Feel free to look through my account but be warned, redditors that have, never came back the same.",

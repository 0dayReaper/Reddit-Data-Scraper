    "postText": "I was made redundant on Friday because the company I work for is shutting down.\n\nI am the only source of in come for my family as my husband is currently in the middle of a mental health crisis. I am uncertain if he would be able to step up and look after our children while I travel to work in an office, let alone find a job and contribute to bills.\n\nI was with my employer for 11 yrs. I have zero qualifications but made my way up to senior management. I am used to that wage, our house which is currently mid renovation depends on it, but looking on line for jobs I can see me having to take a 20,000 a Yr pay reduction if I am lucky.\n\nI have two kids under 3. My current job is not only work from home but work the hours as and when so long as the hours are met ( I had been working from 5 am, during day naps and after the kids are in bed to midnight to allow me to be with my kids in the day). \n\nTrying to be proactive. I had a call with a government ( in the UK), employment consultant yesterday. They were very motivating at the time but having been pumped up about my 'transferable skills' I can't find any jobs I could realisticly apply for.\n\nI had built my perfect life ( minus the ill partne) and think I am about to watch my Rome burn.",

    "postText": "I loved you when no one had ever shown me an ounce of affection. Some days I wake up and remember when the first thing I'd see in the morning was you watching television, The Simpsons to be exact. Maybe you believe the words you say when you're mad at me, maybe you're just saying them out of spite. But I love you, no matter how many arguments you try to create or how many times you feel that I have no emotions, I've always cared and not a day has passed that I've stopped doing it. Sometimes, when I think about us, I remember the good times and smile with the little amount of energy I have after getting home from work or a long night out with friends.\n\nNo, I wasn't the best at all times and my decisions led to this. Perhaps you meeting someone new is life's way of telling me to get better. I lost myself in this mess believing you'd be there to help me, but all I ever did was create distance. After all the times I begged you to leave, not having you here hurts more. Maybe I should've kissed you a little longer. Maybe I should've sent a bit more loving texts. Perhaps it would've changed what I was beginning to lose. It's not my message you're waiting for, and every time you tell me that I'm worthless, that there's nothing good to expect from me, all I can feel is my heart racing with anxiety, knowing that I'm no longer a human being with emotions and feelings, the same one who made love to you with tears falling from your eyes, I wiped them away and held you for the rest of the night, tell me, why aren't you here wiping away my sadness in plain sight? I think I don't deserve your attention or your love. 4 years and a baby later, you're no longer my partner, no longer my special person, I'm just the worst thing that could've presented itself to your life.\n\nI lied. I cheated. I gave up and cared more about myself. You stuck around through my addiction, my therapy and the pills, you saw me fail in everything and still you held onto me like no one else ever has. Today you said that the world would be so much better if I stopped existing. I'm glad someone else thinks the same thing. In giving you your peace of mind, I too will get rid of bad habits. Maybe whatever feelings you have towards me will remain dormant until someday I find a way to show you I'm doing better.\n\nOur baby will always have my support. I wasn't the best boyfriend, but giving him the world is all I live for. I don't know what I'll do after seeing you when I go pick him up. Perhaps someday you'll be with someone so much better and this loss will be a benefit to you. You stated how much you hate me, but my heart bleeds love every single time I think about you.",

It really crushes you when someone you love and saw spending the rest of your life with does something like that. But it\u2019s also a wonderful opportunity for self reflection and catalyst for improvement. For a while I was completely dedicated to fixing myself to try and win her back but the more time went by I started doing it for myself and gave up on her. It\u2019s both depressing and freeing at the same time but at least now I can move on. Idk if this is a complete mess to read but I hope it\u2019s at least a bit comforting to know someone understands what you\u2019re going through on some level",

Gonna save up some cash before entering a gym. I've been smoking a bit too much so I'm thinking of going cold-turkey. There's so much stupid shit about me that I just have to let it all go, but my BPD only makes the emotions so much worse and intense. I've considered everything from trying to write a letter to contemplating suicide. Everything is lost but still, as a father, I'm trying to be strong. Sometimes we gotta fake it 'til we make it. Thanks for the reassurance and if you were strong enough to make it out better than before, that only gives me hope with what I'm going through. Keep it up!",

Honestly, I stopped caring about myself, my future, but I still tried showing her my best efforts. What started as something I thought would get better with antipsychotics only became a really harrowing fall into losing everything. In the end I was expecting this because I have no self-esteem whatsoever, or self-worth. I'd been talking to my psychatrist and psychologist about my relationship and ever since she left, I've been avoiding therapy. I don't care about my feelings and emotions anymore, just gotta stay alive to pay child support because it's not my baby's fault how much of failure I am.",

It's not that you can't get well, it's you don't want to \u2014 the self-fulfilling prophecy. You had love, but you said you lied and cheated. Why? I think because you'd rather watch your relationship crumble, have that going on.. then live in the \"boredom\" that comes with predictability of having a partner and a family. In short, you don't want stability, you don't want sobriety.. you want to create plights and setbacks that you'd have to try to dis-engage from for months, if not years, after. You're keeping yourself busy with the outcomes of your bad choices.\n\nNo?",

With this, I confirmed how attatched I was but I stopped expressing it to her. I tried everything to tell her how sorry I am but it comes to no avail. Just knowing that she's doing great, I know it should cause me some sort of happiness, but in some aspect, I shouldn't care, but I do, because love is the only real thing I have in life and she's gone now. My kid's gonna meet her new guy, whatever comes of it, he's gotta be way better than me in everything. Fuck, typing this only made me hurt and not even the internet is helping.

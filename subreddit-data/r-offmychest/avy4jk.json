    "postText": "I got a 98% on my exam yesterday and I still can\u2019t believe it. Nobody really cares enough for me to tell them so I\u2019m telling you guys. The exam was ridiculously hard and the majority of my class failed it. I still have another exam coming up and test outs but my confidence in my abilities has sky rocketed.\n\nEdit: okay, you guys are all seriously awesome. This has made my week. I did share my grade with my husband after posting and he was pretty excited for me. Sorry to not really respond, I\u2019m still studying for my last exam. I love all of you for this though. I needed this after this ridiculously long semester. \n\nSecond edit: this post is super old on Reddit time but if anyone is still following I got my score back for my last exam. 96%!!!! ",

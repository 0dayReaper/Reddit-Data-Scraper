    "postText": "I absolutely hate my mom she is literally so annoying. She says no to everything like if sometimes sure its ok but literally everytime? Im so sick of it. I get that she wants me protected but like I just hate it. She doesn\u2019t like it when i have friends or someone to talk to. She hates that i always chat them and always threaten to delete the app i use to chat them. She says no in letting me go out with friends because maybe ill get kidnap or talk to strangers and someone \u201cmight\u201d even put drugs on my bag. What difference does it make if im with you or my friends because theres also still the same risks with going out with you or my friends. Then she said no in letting me go to a sleepover because apparently i can get raped when it\u2019s all girls. All my friends are going and not me. Im the one who will stay at my house and be jealous that theyre having fun while im bored at my house. She doesn\u2019t think she just says no to everything. I just want to be with my friends but shes the only one stopping me and im so annoyed of it. Why cant i just have a mom like others that lets their chikd have actually fun in their life.",

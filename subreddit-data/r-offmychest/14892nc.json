    "postText": "About a month ago I (30m) made a month with no drinking. I didn\u2019t really tell anyone I wasn\u2019t drinking incase I didn\u2019t make the month. I haven\u2019t gone a month without drinking for probably 11 years. Well after 30 days I called a couple close friends and family and told them, they seemed happy and surprised. But since nobody really followed up, am I wasting my time?",

Are you doing it for yourself or your friends?\nAre your friends really friends or drinking buddies?\n\nMake new friends if you need to. Friends who don't drink &amp; who will know what a big deal it is that you're no longer drinking. \n\nOnly the best is yet to come. \nONE DAY AT A TIME \u2764\ufe0f",

In my experience the people who interfere in sobriety are people who either want to tear you down or have their own personal agenda as to why they need you to keep drinking.\n\nWell done :)\n\nI'm assuming that you went sober for some particular reason (health, feeling out of control, etc) and I hope that it's working for you. You'll probably be sleeping better, your skin will feel better and you'll have more money in your pocket.",

I don't doubt they are happy for you and will continue to be happy for you. It's quite an achievement. \n\nYou may need to just let them know that you need their support in staying sober. Give them the chance to be part of the journey. Unless you think they wouldn't be supportive. In which case, there are plenty of programs you can join, and places you can reach out to online to talk when you feel wobbly.\n\nYou're doing this for yourself, keep going!",

If you were able to quit for a month and nobody noticed, I assume you kept your drinking pretty quiet or tried to downplay it around others. People are not very observant creatures when it comes to things they don't feel greatly affect themselves.",

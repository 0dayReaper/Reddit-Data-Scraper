    "postText": "Live at home with the rents as a middle aged adult child with Bipolar and drug abuse disorder or whatever you wish to call it.  I'm just never alone.  I try my best to be out of the way and a good type of person, but I'm also doing nothing with my life....no goals, no job, no friends....I kinda got used to it because I could not handle life.\n\nMy family is still there for me...always. I really thought they were gonna get rid of me for all that old trouble and because I have paranoid delusions this idea ran the gamut of just kicking me out to straight up murdering me (i want to make sure its understood, im talking about a delusion not real).   It's been 10 years since I had my catastrophic breakdown.  \n\nSometimes I just feel like they (I'm saying they but I'm not saying who and some aren't included in it) are never stop looking at me.  Never stop searching for something.  I think of cameras, and microphones, and watching and dissecting.  \n\nPerhaps I'm wrong.  What I can say for certain is they can't accept mental illness as something valid.  So if they refute that.....what do they think?  I can talk to them at 33% power but some things are never ever ever going to be addressed. \n\n I love them and don't want problems.  I hope I just feel this and the worst is untrue.",

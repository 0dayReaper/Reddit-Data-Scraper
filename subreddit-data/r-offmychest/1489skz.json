    "postText": "So a little bit of Background i(14) have a brother(3) and mom and dad are in their 40s. In November of 2020 my father went to jail obv it broke us and our family and he got out in early February 2021. We were staying with my aunt and uncle the entire time and it wasn\u2019t the greatest. When he got out it was great for a few week but then after we went to a few cities for work we couldn\u2019t find one where we could live and we could get a good job. This caused A LOT of arguments between my parents. After we went to one town that they still couldn\u2019t agree upon on the ride back they were arguing my mom was crying heavily and dad yelling. A little more context on what happened is my dad completely changed about a week earlier I know that he and my uncle ( his brother) were talking a lot during that time. My dad is a happy person who likes to joke around  with everyone but my uncle is thee opposite stern barely talks and has to have everything the same always. My dad was basically the same after prison but after 2 weeks and talking to my uncle a lot he changed to be like him. My mom was not happy d neither was I. Later that night while sleeping next to him I started to cry and sob cause of the whole situation d having no one to really talk to. He obviously said something like \u201coh come on now your crying to get over it\u201d I just said to become good dad again what happened to you. The next morning I woke up went to the bathroom etc. then when I went into my room to get a towel (parents and me shared a room) I saw them fighting so I quickly left and went to sit on the couch. A bit later the came my mom came out yelling saying that nobody needs her I\u2019m out enough my brother can get adopted etc and holding a knife to her throat. My dad came outside and said you\u2019re to scared to kill your self but when she ultimately tried to he physically stopped her. There were some fights and etc in between but not as serious. Earlier this year in march 2023 there was another incident. My dad was extremely sick with chest pain and bed ridden and my mom was just trying to help him. He kept saying he doesn\u2019t need her etc etc. He said more like he was going to leave her. I heard all the yelling from my room and came out and just started to watch my brother. Then she tried to slit her wrist with a knife and I had to hold her back twice. Then when she ran into the room she feel and leaned against the bed and I started to comfort her. She then started to bang her head against the wall which I I tried to stop. After she calmed down some I kept just saying for her and my dad to try and work things out. Then some fighting has happened in between then and now but it\u2019s mostly been little. I had to tell someone but I don\u2019t know who to tell so I just put. It here.",

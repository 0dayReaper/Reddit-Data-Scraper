That's all.  I'm pathetic. And drunk atm.\n\nEdit: I also miss my older sister as she would be the one that I could turn to. But she is gone. Commited suicide 2 years ago but  I kept repressing it until the break up with my ex in January. My life is just so messed up. Full of close people that are gone now. The most important one I didn't even get to know because I was too young to remember.",

And they can't seem to understand that the fact I still didn't get over my ex that I did care about doesn't stop me from doing what I can to move on. It's hard for feelings to go away but I chose them over my ex every single day. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of being strong. I'm sick of being told I'm strong. I don't want to bear everything by myself.",

It just feels like I'm not being understood. I suspect having ADHD and being on the spectrum. But I can't even prove it to myself because it's so expensive. I'm functioning normally on daily basis but I'm always exhausted. I was proud this morning i went from 126% to 194% performance at work as a part-time worker. I'm also a international student. My ex and current date are both natives. I feel used by my ex and I can't force myself to trust someone else so quickly. But that doesn't mean I don't care.",

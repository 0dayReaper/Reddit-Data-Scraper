I just don\u2019t feel like getting a bunch of dms from men \u201cthat are different\u201d from this. \n\nI love the subreddits meetpeople and makenewfriendshere, and I also love meeting new people to game with. It does not matter to me what your ASL is as long as we can vibe it\u2019s fine by me.\n\nThe problem I have with MOST men is that when they find out I\u2019m a woman they will so obviously use words they wouldn\u2019t if they were talking to a man. Like using pet names, flirting, using heart emojis etc. \n\nAnd I know what you\u2019re thinking; \u201cThey\u2019re just being nice\u201d. Well I understand but it makes me feel uncomfortable. I just want friends that don\u2019t call me pet names and act weird around me. \n\nAlmost every time I think I finally found someone nice to voice chat or just text with they either start doing that, or they confess feelings for me after a bit.\n\nEvery time a topic like this gets brought up  there is going to be men that will say things like \u201coh it must be soooo hard to be wanted\u201d or whatever. But I think this is an alright subreddit to talk abt it. I just wanted to get this off my chest.",

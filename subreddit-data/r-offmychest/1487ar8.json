    "postText": "I've been with my man for 2 years 3\u00bd months. He told me he was charged for assault to a minor under the age of 15. He told me the story of how he met up with a 12yr old girl when he was 18 turning 19 in only a couple months. They both agreed to have some fun, but when she asked to have sex with him, he told her no realizing in that moment he was making a huge mistake. After her constant begging and him saying no, she got the cops involved. He's not officially registered/labeled as a SO, he has a chance to get all his charges dropped. I found out there were other under age girls he was potentially flirting and wanting to have fun with. The worst part is that they were after the 12yr old he claimed to be a huge mistake he's ever made and quote \"would never ever do again\", but if that was the case then why did  he continue to still talk to underage girls (grown woman too). I recently asked him the question \n\n\"were there other young girls other than the 12 year old? Whether over the phone or in person, and be completely honest with me\". He replied saying \n\"I promise I won't lie to you, but no it was only the one girl\". \n\nI was just stunned he just lied promising me he wouldn't. He said he's ashamed and he absolutely should be. He knew it was wrong so why would he keep pursuing? He didn't meet up with anymore young girls, but he still tried to through text. He's in jail right now for violating his probation avoiding it for 226 days almost a whole year. I don't know what to do. I believed he was very sorry and ashamed and it showed a lot. Now that I know there was more than just one girl he tried to mess around with especially after the 12 year old he claimed was the only one (in person/no sex)\n\n I'm questioning him and our relationship. Is it worth staying and seeing it through? I love him so much, but what he did was very wrong plus the lies. Yet he says jail time will be good for him, because it will make him a better man. That he's found GOD in his life and asked for forgiveness. Think about his actions ect. Or do I leave him because of his past, because it could potentially follow me if he doesn't follow through what he needs to do to get his charges dropped completely? Thoughts?..",

            "comment": "I think you should run away, tbh. The fact that there have been multiple girls is very concerning. Plus, in a one-time circumstance I could see an 18-19 year old talking to a mature 16 year old and not realizing she\u2019s underage. But 12??? He absolutely knew. 12 year olds not only look young, but the way they speak and the words they choose to use are much different.\n\nIt sounds to me like something about this one girl spooked him, but that he would go on to prey on other underage girls if he judged there was a lower risk of repercussion.",

You're 100% correct 12 year olds look, speak, act, and ARE young. I don't like telling people to leave their partners but this time I suggest OP run for the hills without ever looking back again!! Just the 12 year old situation would have me hitting reverse, let alone all of the other \"just texts\" and attempts.",

I told him the same thing like you know that's some body's daughter and what would they think and feel to hear their little girl and an adult man were about to have sex and they weren't there to protect her. I also told him what if you had a 13 yr old (or of any age bfr an adult) and you were told a young adult man and your daughter were almost intimate. He said he would beat the shit out of the man, and I told him to sit, think, and soak that in.",

You don't deserve any of what he's done either weather it was before, during or after that he's done any of this. You seem like a smart person who is just really confused in all of this and for that I'm really sorry. Like I said, I'd never normally advise someone to just up and leave their partner but in this instance I would highly recommend it because you don't deserve any flak for what was and is well out of your control. I mean, it's good he's honest with you but Queen you don't need to be linked with anyone like that. You deserve more. Especially if he's been taking advantage of your relationship by texting other girls weather of legal age or fully grown women. I hope things work out for the best for you whatever path you choose",

Yeah he violated his parole while with me cause he was on drugs and didn't want to drop dirty so he stopped talking to his PO and getting drug tested for 226 days even tho I tried getting him cleaned 3-4 times he just kept doing it behind my back so I eventually just gave up it's his mistake he's doing not mine. That's what got him thrown in jail. They said as long as he finishes his probation with added years to it, goes through the halfway house, and gets the help he needs he'll get his charges dropped and be free. If he doesn't he'll be arrested on the spot and go to prison for a very long time and be registered as a SO. He said he's gonna do everything he's told he doesn't want me to deal with shit like this and yet I am, but he swears it'll never happen again and he's owning up to his mistakes. It's people like that one dude that commented saying I'm a pedo chaser, and keeping him around to help him prey on his next victim is what I don't want to deal with cause that shit really hurts. Being with him makes me just as bad as a person...",

He was charged for sexual assault not fucking rape, and he wasn't put out as a SO cause even the judges saw something about him. Plus the girl was the one who kept fucking prying on him. Fuck you for saying I keep him around for him to prey on victims when I didn't even FUCKING know. He's sincerely sorry for what he did and it shows a lot n he's doing his time and getting the help he needs. Im not fucking protecting him because he did a very bad thing but all I can do is hope he gets the treatment he needs. Im not a goddamn pedo chaser, a fucking rapist assistant to trap a vict, ect whatever. He's doing everything he can to get his charges dropped cause he doesn't want to live with it and he doesn't want me to deal with it and the crap that comes with it which I'm talking about you, you're the crap.",

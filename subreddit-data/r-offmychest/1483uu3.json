I have such a fear that my boys, who are so close now, will stop talking  in the future and I don\u2019t even know how to prevent it because I don\u2019t even know where it went wrong for us. I have replayed every last correspondence over in my mind for the past 11 years, and I keep coming up blank. I just want the chance to move forward. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I did back then but we were just kids when whatever it was went down. We may be different people now but know that I will always love you .",

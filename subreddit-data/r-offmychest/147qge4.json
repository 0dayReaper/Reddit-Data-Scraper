    "postText": "So I keep thinking about this one memory I have from when I was little no older than kindergarten maybe not even In preschool, but my whole life I can remember this so clearly, my shirt, my underwear, what bed, what my room looked liked, even what the blankets looked like. The more I think about it the more I feel weird and icky, so the memory I have is it was maybe 9pm and my cousin was staying over he's maybe 5 years older than me and were in bed getting ready to sleep(God thinking about this makes me cringe) he \"fiddles\" with my underwear like he's rubbing the seems? Idk if that's the right word but he's rubbing under and them around I turn around and look at him in the dark and he laughs asking if I liked it, this is were I feel disgusting I say yeah and laugh God I hate that it feel good and he told me not to tell anyone, but I pray that this is a fake memory because I truly love my cousin and he doesn't seem liked he'd do that, but I also think I'm at fault because I told him it felt good I think I thought it was a massage because I remember it feeling like when you get goosebumps on your neck from someone rubbing it or breathing on it if that makes sense. An it's worse because if this is real he also probably remembers it because he's older and has better memory at that age I've wanted to tell my therapist but I feel ashamed that I let it happen and I feel like it can't be sa if I enjoyed it and didn't tell him to stop. And I don't want to get him in trouble or ruin our relationship I just want peace with myself",

It took a long time to come to terms with, but I did. Take the time you need to process this memory, but please please share it with your therapist. They can help guide you through what you're feeling and help you get to a place where you don't feel at fault. These things are scary, even more so when it involves someone you love and trust, but you are not alone. Not one little bit.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s worth talking to a therapist about this. The truth is, you were both children. You were too young to understand sexuality, and only understand \u201cfeels good, feels bad\u201d. Your cousin was older but also a child and likely exploring curiosity or maybe even repeating behavior he witnessed or encountered.\n\nThat said, even if this was based in innocence I can understand wanting to resolve the buried feelings around it. Especially when you as an adult have more context. Just don\u2019t put your adult mind in the place of the kid brains that were in the situation. A therapist can really help you come to terms with this and move forward with a healthy perspective. &lt;3",

When somebody says to me, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about suicide, I have a plan; I just need a reason not to do it,\u201d the last thing I see is helplessness.\n\nI think: Your depression has been beating you up for years. It\u2019s called you ugly, and stupid, and pathetic, and a failure, for so long that you\u2019ve forgotten that it\u2019s wrong. You don\u2019t see good in yourself, and you don\u2019t have any hope.\n\nBut still, here you are; you\u2019ve come over to me, banged on my door, and said, \u201cHEY! Staying alive is REALLY HARD right now! Just give me something to fight with! I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a stick! Give me a stick and I can stay alive!\u201d\n\nHow is that helpless? I think that\u2019s incredible. You\u2019re like a marine: Trapped for years behind enemy lines, your gun has been taken away, you\u2019re out of ammo, you\u2019re malnourished, and you\u2019ve probably caught some kind of jungle virus that\u2019s making you hallucinate giant spiders.\n\nAnd you\u2019re still just going \u201cGive me a stick! I\u2019m not dying out here!\u201d\n\n\u201cA cry for help\u201d makes it sound like I\u2019m supposed to take pity on you. But you don\u2019t need my pity. This isn\u2019t pathetic. This is the will to survive. This is how humans lived long enough to become the dominant species.\n\nWith NO hope, running on NOTHING, you\u2019re ready to cut through a hundred miles of hostile jungle with nothing but a stick, if that\u2019s what it takes to get to safety.\n\nAll I\u2019m doing is handing out sticks.\n\nYou\u2019re the one staying alive.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nStay safe, my friend. You\u2019ve got this.",

I looked around and the only thing I had to look forward to was Chinese food. Fucking Chinese food, for shits sake. That\u2019s it. But it got me through that day. \n\nThat was my stick.  And it got me through till I found another. \n\nWhat I know now that I would\u2019ve told me then is that I didn\u2019t have to get through the rest of my life. I just had to hold on through the rest of the week. Fuck it, I just had to get through the next ten minutes and if I did that, just that, even if it was holding on by my fingernails to nothing more than a plate of goddamn sesame chicken, that meant I wasn\u2019t beat. I had a win. I had a win and That meant I had a chance to win the ten minutes after that. \n\nI still love Chinese food and I think this is the first time I\u2019ve ever told anyone why. \n\nFind your stick.",

I'm glad that there's at least some progress made.\n\nWithin a month alone, all has lead up to officers who use too much force being fired and even charged. Statues are being torn down and streets renamed just because they have ties to slavery. Protests and marches worldwide. Social Media campaigns bringing light to the evil of anti-black racism.\n\nObviously we shouldn't get complacent as there's still a long way to go and much more work to be done.",

I am currently getting a master's in history, so I felt like it was my duty as an academic and an ally to stand up and explain to my ignorant friends why this was happening and how history led to so much racism and oppression in the United States. \nI was changing people's minds, people who were offended by the thought of having Juneteenth as a holiday were getting excited and opening up to the idea that the police were racist. Then my mentor in my recovery program started explaining how everything I said was wrong and how they had many conversations with black friends to prove it. They started arguing that all this social justice was a sin, and all my knowledge about history was an opinion and not fact. They even sent me a video of pastors slandering and lying about BLM. I was feeling defeated, and because these people are my elders and mentors, I started second-guessing myself. This post and your reply has re-inspired me, my biggest worry is hurting the people I'm advocating for, but I now see that is all just lies told by ignorant people. I will continue do my best to keep raising awareness and advocating for civil rights and equality for all people who are living in a nation with oppression and racism. I am so sorry for all the evil white people have done and continue to do.",

Can't fix anything if you don't talk about it openly. Trevor Noah said one of the things he wish he could bring to the USA from South Africa is how openly they talk about past racism and oppression, because if it's out in the open and discussed you can actually learn about/from it.\n\nHere in the US it's ignored, overlooked, then forgotten, so no progress is ever made.

My hippie mom would be so thrilled to see these days, bless her soul. \n\nI have to say, and it\u2019s pathetic, but a bunch of us White people are so locked up in our own shit, because we have the ability to be this way because Johnny Law doesn\u2019t immediately see us as suspect, and because it\u2019s convenient to use this as an excuse, that we never \u2018noticed\u2019 how Black folk are treated. \n\nOh yeah, we see the news stories, we are outraged, but we are not living on the knife edge of survival that our Black brothers and sisters navigate, every day. As we have learned and realized since the passing of our friend, Mr. George Floyd, the reality of daily life for Black Americans is that they can be forced into our criminal justice system at the drop of a hat, any time, any day, 24/7/365. \n\nWe as White suburbanites are raising kids, paying bills, dealing with traffic, living busy lives, struggling to survive like anybody else. When we see movies about black drug gangs in NYC and LA, the stereotype those movies paint in our minds is hard to erase. Movies and media have a huge impact on us. Black youth and the Glock held at a 90 degree angle are all we older White folk to fear L. A., Black people, and shopping after 10am. I don\u2019t know why Black actors allow themselves to be portrayed in these roles anymore, except the roles are visible and available, and actors need work. But movies like these are killing Black social growth, IMHO, and giving Whites the wrong impression of Black/Brown culture. \n\nI had to re-read and edit this comment to ensure that I wasn\u2019t being \u2018apologetic\u2019 for Whites. I am clearly not apologetic, and I loath our laziness and blindness to Black injustice and suffering due to the shared \u2018inconvenience\u2019 that participating in such pain would \u2018put me through.\u2019 I hate this \u2018hatred\u2019 that racism causes.

Ive known people with black friends who drop the n word all the time. This issue is so deep rooted that we haven\u2019t even begun to unravel the problem. What causes racism? What makes people hate in the first place? How can some people have black friends and acquaintances, then callously refer to any other black person by that word? A lot of congressmen/congresswomen and representatives are old enough to have gone to segregated schools, and grew up in that doctrine. But what\u2019s the next step? Like how does racism and the mindset of it go away? It feels like we\u2019re trapped in a circle, we had a black president for crying out loud. Now we\u2019re back to this antiquated ass shit, fucking dumb man. I\u2019m sorry this is still even an issue.",

It's a daily battle to resist and sometimes it's so subtle, you don't realize the influence it has on you.  I am sorry that this is a thing.  I wasn't raised to be biased, my parents certainly never gave me cause to feel one way or another.  I am incredibly happy that so much seems to be changing to move to racial equality.  I believe that judging a person is inevitable.  But for me, I try to judge by merit and the actions of the person, the character and integrity they display.  That is how I want to be judged. How else can we be a functioning healthy society if not by those measures?  And, as an edit, I can only apologize if I have ever offended another person, regardless of color.  I try to be a positive person who affirms others, not tears them down.",

    "postText": "My gf and i have been together for a little over a year. We live in different cities but we drive up often to see each other. Today she planned on seeing her ex. They stayed friends after 3 years of dating and a mutual break up and my partner is completely honest with me abt their rlsp so i never had an issue with their friendship. To preface, im 20, my partner is 26 and her ex is 36. Her ex has been trying for some time to have a baby thru a donor and it finally took on and now she's 3 months pregnant and she decided to tell my partner at their dinner tonight. After disappearing for the afternoon (typical when she's busy out with someone) she texts me abt her ex's pregnancy and that she is \"devastated\". After some probing she explains that the reason is she still expected them to be \"young independant people doing things together\" her exact words and she feels like everyone is moving on and she's stuck in the same place. She referenced her best friend moving in with her gf and her ex getting pregnant. After saying this and given how serious i thought our rlsp was getting, im a bit offended. How could she say that she's not moving anywhere when i've felt like we were heading towards a long term committed rlsp. Im just at a loss for what to do and im just waiting for a break up now.",

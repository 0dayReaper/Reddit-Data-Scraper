    "postText": "Hello, I'm a female in my late 20s... 26 to be exact and I have never fallen in love before. I know it sounds weird and lie but I just never actually thought about it. I have never had a crush nor had that feelings towards anyone. I thought that maybe I might be acesexual cause when ever I saw or heard about people doing the deed I always felt sick. But then I just started to feel lonely, you know like even I wanted to talk to someone, even I wanna hug someone or kiss them or just hold their hands or just have someone who is happy to see me. So now I think I'm just becoming too desperate to find that feeling, from anyone... But to the outside world I always say eww no, I don't want love, I'm happy the way I am and other things which are actually not true. I say this because I don't want other people to label me as some despo chick who's easy... Cause I am not that. Is this too bad?? Should I just leave everything behind and become a monk... I'm even planning to do that too. \n\nHelp.",

            "comment": "I'm 31, never had a relationship before and I seriously thought I was asexual to.\n\nBut wanting someone means you're not. \nAnd also if you are.. there are many asexuals who wish for a partner without the sex, but that aside. \n\nI started dating through dating apps. I met a lot of idiots and really thought: nvm I become a crazy cat lady. I'm not interested in love! \n\nAfter things ended with another failed date I wanted to quit. But the feeling of being alone overwhelmed me. Especially because I became \"older\" and saw my friends being in happy relationships. I pretended not caring, but I did. But also I was scared to get hurt and letting someone close. \n\nSo I installed a dating app again and thought in my rage: I'll do this only once! If this fails, I don't care anymore! And then I swiped on a guy that wasn't my type at first. But I thought.. well I got nothing to lose.. I'll be a nun anyway. \n\nHe was the most funny, loving and caring type I ever met. I really started liking him after a couple of dates. And eventually I fell in love. I'm in a relationship with him since. And I can't imagine a live without him.\n\nOn dating apps you meet a lot of idiots, you experience a lot of failed dates. And sometimes love or an interest in someone doesn't come immediately. But if you feel 'i'm ready to meet someone' then the chance is that you do :). \n\nMaybe you can try it, you got nothing to lose.. the monastery can wait.",

            "comment": "Hey you should maybe check out some aromantic resources. You sound a lot like how I felt when I was first realizing that I might be aromantic and asexual. At first it was a really hard thing to deal with because I thought I was going to be alone forever, but now it\u2019s something I consider positive. If you aren\u2019t aromantic, you might still get something out of seeing relatable stories and other people who feel similarly to what you describe. You aren\u2019t alone in wanting someone to be your person, even if you haven\u2019t felt that way about anyone before!",

Make sure to find someone who will listen to how you feel without disregarding your experience :) (also if you are at all interested in aromantic resources, aro_comics on instagram is a nice place to start \u2013 cute but informative). I wish you all the best in finding a helpful therapist!",

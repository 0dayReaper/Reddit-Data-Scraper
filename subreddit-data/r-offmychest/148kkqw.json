    "postText": "Sat there trying to figure out how I fucked up the one particular question (it was a live environment) the entire drive home. Pulled into my driveway and realized I missed it by one mistyped step.\n\nNow I get to explain to my boss that I'm an idiot and will need to retake it. I've never been more angry with myself.\n\nEdit: to rub even more salt into my wounds, I had 45mins to spare, spent the entire time trying to get a command to work. I literally ran it to the last minute before accepting I must not know what I'm doing. \n\nTurns out, I just fucking forgot to add something to a command. Definitely would've passed if I had got it right.",

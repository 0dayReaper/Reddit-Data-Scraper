    "postText": "This year has been the hardest year of my life. I feel so suffocated by everything lately and I feel like I'm going to snap. My dad who was also my best friend my rock and the only person in the world who loves me unconditionally has recently passed away and I never knew how hard and unprepared for this moment I was. I broke my no contact with my mom and brother of over a decade and had to break it to tell them the news of my fathers passing. Their abusive manipulative and unhelpful behavior through navigating this hard time has really put a lot of strain on me mentally on top of the crippling debt that also comes with loss. My work which used to be my sanctuary and a medium for expression feels soul crushing now. I cant stop bursting into tears which has lead me to have sever anxiety and panic attacks. I've been leaning on two friends in particular and one of which is my coworker who continues to maintain contact with my r\\*pist  (I told him he's going to chose to be friends with who he choses and I cant make those choices for him. He also doesn't know the severity of the sexual assault, just that there was sexual assault) I've set parameters like never talking about how I'm doing or what I'm doing along with barring him from coming to my place of employment. Said friend/ coworker has now confessed that on my day off my r\\*pist texted him asking if he could come into my workplace and have lunch which he agreed to. I feel totally betrayed by my friend. I am now the shell of a person an orphan with no one and nowhere to go.",

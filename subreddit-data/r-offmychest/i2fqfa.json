    "postText": "I\u2019m a woman in my late twenties and most other young women I know do not share the same sentiment as me. I\u2019m not anti-marriage, but I am anti-wedding!\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid in a handful of weddings, 75% of them have ended in divorce after less than 2 years of marriage. I\u2019ve seen first hand all that goes into planning an elaborate wedding, and what the most important aspect of the wedding is: photos. \n\nFrom the diamond rings that get shown off in every single selfie like a trophy, the professional engagement photos, expectations of showers, bachelorette parties costing hundreds of dollars, personalized hashtags, the cost of the dresses and accessories, the cost of the weddings themselves, how much time is spent before and during the ceremony taking professional photos and how much staging goes into it..... and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, getting gorgeous photos to share on social media, to rub it in everyone\u2019s faces how much money you have and how pinterest perfect your life appears to be. \n\nA lot of this comes down to the toxicity of social media in general, and old fashioned consumerism... I can\u2019t help but to find it pathetic.",

My dress was $250 and my husband\u2019s suit was from JC Penney. Three years later we still hear about how our wedding was so much fun. With all the cash wedding gifts we received we went on a magical honeymoon to Ireland - instead of paying off wedding debt.\n\nOh, and sister-in-law took the pictures which all came out great because everyone is candid and relaxed, not force posed.",

It ballooned to a 175 person guest list of people we don\u2019t really know that well and our costs increased significantly. Basically I talked with her and the only way we would do it is if they paid for the most expensive part, the food. For all of these people to have catering (which we opted for buffet style instead of plated because we want a casual wedding, $10k. What??? Then all the other stuff they want to add on. We\u2019re responsible for a photographer and our venue. The venue is a tiny local place we love and the photographer is also a super local photographer who does amazing work for a reasonable price. We\u2019re about $4k all in with dress and suit as well. Just, I can\u2019t believe how expensive weddings are and it\u2019s obscene to me. If our parents weren\u2019t insistent that we have a wedding, we would have eloped. And now our wedding is postponed a year because of Covid. Was supposed to be last month.",

The locals there explained how couples would have to consult priests (excuse me if that's the wrong term) in order to plan their date according to various religious guidelines. The ceremonies consisted of some sort of parade with music that processed through the city. Very fascinating!",

We were together for 6 years before we got married, so we definitely knew we had a stable and compatible relationship.

We knew that as the years went by we would want beautiful photos to remember such a special day. Our style was kind of an enchanted forest and we sourced all of our vendors locally from small farms so it was really a celebration of our community. We did a lot of diy so we saved money where we could, but still spent around 10k all told. In the end I am happy with it, everything turned out exactly how I imagined it, we had a wonderful event surrounded by our favorite people, and I have photos that captured the vibe perfectly and fill me with joy every time I look at them. I am a very low-maintenance person, and don\u2019t really like to have a lot of focus on myself most of the time, so that was the one chance in my life to feel like a princess and I got to share it with my person.

I was also pretty chill on most things and just wanted it planned as fast as possible. Things that\u2019s I specifically wanted my husband and I purchased. My mom chipped in for venue and his parents threw the rehearsal dinner.\n\nWe also spent a lot on photography (that and food and the dress were important to me). I actually have only posted a few wedding shot on social media. We retained all the rights to every photo and video and I just love that I can go back and look at them all the time.

We kept the guest list small but it was still $10k-plus all told. I do feel it was largely money well spent though because we prioritized what was really important to us and skipped the things we didn\u2019t care about. (And we could afford what we spent.) As an experience it was honestly the best day of my life.\n\nAll that said, my husband and I have talked about this a lot and agree that if we had planned to get married in 2020 we would have scrapped all those plans and had a quick private ceremony. At the end of the day it\u2019s about the person you\u2019re with and none of the other really stuff matters. Wedding or not I know I made the right choice.",

I loved our wedding, it was very out of character for us as introverts to host a big party and allow ourselves to be the center of attention so it was really a memorable and unique night. We spent maybe $12k, with my parents chipping in about $7k of that. But we thought of it like hosting a family reunion/dinner party, because those don\u2019t happen too often in my family! And we had an open bar so even just the food, alcohol, and a venue big enough for about 80 people was the majority of the cost. My dress was maybe like $400, and it was the first and only time I have ever had my hair &amp; makeup done professionally, so I am at my most beautiful in those photos and I really cherish them. We used an amateur/friend photographer, my mom made the wedding cake, my aunt did the flower arrangements, my brother in law officiated... etc. We found a ton of ways to save money, but still, feeding that many people is going to add up. I just can\u2019t imagine getting married without all of those people around me though! We certainly didn\u2019t go into debt for our wedding and have always been extremely frugal, plus we were 27 and both had careers by the time we got married, so the money wasn\u2019t a huge issue.",

Marriage and weddings are conflated so bad...people acted like I didn't love my husband cause I wasn't excited about wedding dress shopping and making birdseed sachets. It's in my personality to hate all that shit, I'm sorry. It just feels superficial and I really dislike attention. Weddings and everything leading up to them are a total introvert's nightmare. I was so uncomfortable the entire time (planning and the day of), and I think people resented me for my choices. (I didn't have a bridal shower or bridesmaids...my MIL and SIL kept hassling me about color-coordinating the men's outfits. Like omg I can't even begin to pretend to have an opinion about tie colors, sorry. And my MIL gave me a reputation as a bridezilla among her friends when I was probably the most subdued semi-catatonic bride the world had ever seen.)\n\n\nIt's been 5 years and still, looking back, I wish we just eloped like we wanted. I know I should let it all go cause it's all water under the bridge, and I'm grateful for the work my mom put into it and what's done is done. But anybody who says it's \"your day\" is entirely full of shit. We were told that we could have a \"small\" wedding, or elope and come back to expect a giant reception in which we would have no input. It was bullshit but we picked the lesser of two evils, I guess. \n\nBut yeah fuck modern American wedding culture. I feel like I have PTSD from it.",

Admittedly, our parents cooked the food, which wasn\u2019t bad because we only had 7 guests (9 people total). Neither of us feel like we missed out on anything, if anything we feel like we lucked out because we had no family drama (other than my grandma being pissed she wasn\u2019t invited- she still hasn\u2019t said a word to me, not even congrats). \n\nI would absolutely recommend a small wedding to our friends. It was super relaxed and we can take the money we saved and put it towards home improvements. Even my ring was (comparatively) inexpensive because I wanted something that wouldn\u2019t catch on yarn (I knit for my job). \n\nAnyway, I agree with you. Wedding culture is gross and toxic. My mom and I joke about it being a \u201cdog and pony show\u201d for family members who want to make snide comments about wealth/status.",

Shoes and bathing suits optional. Lasted all of 5 minutes. We made our own food (tacos! Cause who hates tacos!) with lots of options. Sit where you can find a place and eat what ya want!

It was a beautiful wedding and I was very happy that day, you are right great pictures. My wonderful parents paid for it, and then paid for my sisters wedding the next year. I got divorced at 31. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! I still apologize to my parents for wasting their money all the time, I feel awful. I was just reorganizing my kitchen today and joking with my parents about how I had an awful marriage but I did get amazing kitchen appliances out of the deal. What a waste of time and money for me, my wedding party, my parents and all the guests. I always joke we should have saved the money for therapy.... No seriously.\n\nLOVE is all that matters. The MARRIAGE is all that matters. If I ever got married again I would do it in the backyard or in a park and only hire a photographer and a caterer. No extra parties, just a meaningful ceremony and good food with the people I care about. Focus on what matters.\n\nI have also been a bridesmaid in 3 weddings which cost me $500-$1000 each. These three girls we're also my bridesmaids so it was reciprocal but damn. Asking someone to drop that kind of money is such a big ask, and it's just culturally accepted.\n\nThis also makes me incredibly forgiving when I'm not invited to a wedding. I get it, weddings are so expensive. But people get so offended by things like that. \n\nBut this is divorced person logic.... My never married friends are still super into planning their blown out weddings. So I just stay quiet and buy a gift off their registry and eat the free food.",

I am 26 and have been dating my bf for 6 years so I am pretty damn tired of this topic coming up in my life. I am so happy with our relationship and life we've built together, but we have yet to get over this giant hurdle of what our families/friends expect of us in regards to  a wedding. I have never fanatasized about being a bride, anyone that knows me, knows that I would fucking hate being the center of attention. And above all, we are very frugal with many life goals that we deem much more important than our wedding. It is absolutely insane to me what people shell out for weddings. I have been a maid of honor and a bridesmaid in the last 3 years so I pretty well know the typical activities/planning/costs/commitments that come with it and most simply put, it is just not for me. Unfortunately the rest of our families do not seem to understand that so here we are. \n\nSorry, your post seems to have set me off on a rant of my own. So if nothing else, I feel ya!",

The families already seemed very integrated with each other and it was a blast. Half the family were comprised of Syrian migrants who had Seen Some Shit, and they were hilarious people with an awesome outlook on life. Everyone was drunk, there a mix of Syrian and English dance music, and the only time any of us sat was during speeches. \n\nI don\u2019t know how much that wedding cost to throw, but it didn\u2019t matter how much they did or didn\u2019t spend.

            "comment": "I agree that wedding culture is toxic, but don't necessarily agree with everything you said here.\n\nFor me the toxic portion of the wedding culture as it is now is HAVING to have a giant wedding or somehow your marriage won't start off correctly. Going into debt for your wedding. Being greedy for wedding gifts or money. And only having a wedding to show off to others.\n\nSure, lots of things often tie into that (like photos, as you mentioned) but that doesn't make those things inherently toxic themselves. It's the attitude behind them that matters.\n\nTo be clear, I had a $10k (Canadian, so maybe $7.5k USD) wedding last summer, which was totally affordable for us. For the area I had it in (small province in Canada where I am from), it was VERY grand! 100+ guests, a Mac&amp;cheese buffet, a pie buffet, a large hall, live band, and yes; staged pictures.\n\nHowever, none of this was done for anything but my husband and I's vision for our day, and how we wanted to celebrate it. INCLUDING the photos; there are plenty of beautiful candids from our wedding, but I'm also not someone who is in a lot of photos so I appreciated the photos where someone directed me to pose; and the staged photos turned out stunning. Those photos are some of my favorite reminders of the day; they're my phone backgrounds, computer backgrounds, framed above my home office desk, etc. I'm glad we paid $2.5k for those photos because they LOOK as magical as I felt on that day! Something I don't think we would've been able to capture without help, and while my memories are lovely.... Well, details fade. These I can look at when I'm 80 and have forgotten the exact colors I chose, or flavors of pie, or the pattern on the table cloths. The little stuff.\n\nOverall I think when we talk about weddings it's REASONS that are toxic, and not actions themselves, like a lot of things in life. Weddings have absolutely become a problematic thing in today's society, but there are still plenty of people getting married this way just because they want to throw a once-in-a-lifetime party for a once-in-a-lifetime event!\n\nAlso to clarify I don't want to invalidate your perspective (especially since I don't know if you are from the USA even), but the current national divorce rate is actually 39%, which is the lowest it's been in a while. It seems like your social group may be an outlier at 75% then, and not the norm?",

            "comment": "When my wife and I were planning our wedding we knew we wanted to avoid all that. We wanted the main emphasis to be on celebrating with us in an authentic way. So while we wanted to have things to be nice we knew that this wasn\u2019t about a setting this up as a status symbol. The day came and everybody had a great time and nobody cared that we didn\u2019t really have \u201ccolors\u201d, weren\u2019t wearing super formal stuff or that she lacked a retinue. \n\nThe worst wedding we ever went to was one with all the trappings where the father of the bride (who made a living as being on the border of being a slumlord) basically wanted to use this as an excuse to be a status symbol and show himself off as a pater familias. It turned out to be more about him than the couple. In addition there was a crazy amount of petty behind the scenes inter/intra family drama that\u2019s still causing fallout in their relationship. They\u2019re also now on the verge of divorce.\n\nThe truth is: if you ever do choose to get engaged nobody will give a rats butt about it if you don\u2019t do what you\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to do. As long as the celebration is authentic to you, your family, and friends, then don\u2019t worry. They\u2019ll appreciate it and you\u2019ll be able to save money put to better use on your house or something.",

I'm regretful because I thinking about what I didn't do and what I should've done and how I will probably never have the close relationship with these same people again.",

It was hard to leave all of the people I was around for 6 years, but I also knew that there were new opportunities for me to make new friends and meet new people along the way. Sometimes people don\u2019t always stay in our lives all our life, they come and go. Some stay for a short time, some stay for a while, and some stay forever. It is the way life is and unfortunately sometimes seeing people go is very painful.",

You will reinvent yourself and discover things you didn\u2019t know about before. It\u2019ll be hard not to reflect in year\u2019s to come on how you could have done things differently but that\u2019s okay too. As long as you don\u2019t obsess about it. This is the start of your journey to become who you really want to be. Breath and try to be graceful as you close one chapter and start a new one.",

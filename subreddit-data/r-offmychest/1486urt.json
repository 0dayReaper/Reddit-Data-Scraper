    "postText": "About a week ago now, the friend that I\u2019ve known for 10months now turned out to be a pedophile. This all happened when I was walking with him back to his place and I noticed undercover cop cars right by his place\u2026 as soon as we got closer they all hopped out of the car yelling search warrant. I was really confused thinking this must be a mistake. Turns out, IT WAS THE GODDAMN SECRET SERVICE! We are both going through a challenging part in our lives (getting sober) and I\u2019m not sure if I should stay supportive or not. They teach us to be kind and understanding in the program we are in, but as a man with a 17year old sister, I can\u2019t help but feel disgusted\u2026 I just had to rant cuz this has been on my mind all week. Thanks",

    "postText": "Backstory : My parents were married for 20 years before they divorced back in 2019 officially. The reasoning behind their divorce was my dad\u2019s infidelity. He has cheated on my mom previously when I was 11 causing me from such a young age to become depressed and so many other issues. They got back together just for only at 17 him do it again and then leave because this time it was with someone he \u2018loves\u2019 causing them when I was 19 to divorce. The divorce became nasty, and my father changed into a man who I did not recognize, even leaving the country entirely. He wasn\u2019t my dad anymore\n\nI\u2019m 23 (f) currently, my father isn\u2019t in my life and their is no relationship at all. During the time of the divorce I spiraled a bit causing me to be easily influenced in looking for male attention and my main way of finding it was online. Before anyone thinks I just wanted the physical love type, it never hit that part because I was looking for someone to want me for me, that I was good enough. I was lacking that kind of feeling because the man who was suppose to show me I was enough, dropped the ball. This lead to daddy issues and so many more issues of always doubting myself and even hurting myself mentally in hopes of someone else did it, it did not hurt so bad. I was addicted to the matches and to the constant complimented even though I knew some of them were just lying, it was still nice to get that type of attention. During this time, I was also going to school went to community college from 18-21 then transferring to the current university I am in and about to graduate. My father would not be attending in case anyone wanted to know. I focused on school while at the same going boy crazy which was the first time in my life. And in that addiction the same cycle appeared. \n\nI would match with someone they would be nice and polite, meeting would be talked about, we would meet then after it I would not hear them again. If it wasn\u2019t that then it was they were looking for physical love and I denied always as I did not want to fall lower than I already did in my craving for someone to love me. I got use to this cycle that I would already prepare myself to just be hurt so I did it first before they did because I could not take another unknown blow again. I stopped talking to guys when I was 21. I the antes to know who I was and if I needed to heal. I thought I was doing that, but when at 22 I saw a guy at my university. I began to befriend him and fell for him, I realized how wrong I was. \n\nThis lead to now, that past crush opened my eyes on how much more I needed done, but the guy I like now and currently dating if you can say, is just showing that I have to heal. I am way better than I was at 19 and even 22 but I am still hurting myself at any little inconvenience or non talking period because I feel unworthy for the attention. This guy is amazing and so understanding. If it ended it would hurt but he showed me what it means to want to be with someone just around and that I\u2019m good enough. I just ask, do I ever heal? Does this ever go away alone? Can I just be happy and see the light? Can I enjoy the moment not look at when the end is coming? Even hope it came because I don\u2019t want to hurt later\u2026\n\nDo I ever heal?",

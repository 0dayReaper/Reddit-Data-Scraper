    "postText": "Without going into too much detail, my (20F) parents and I didn't have the greatest relationship growing up. I had a string of mental health issues, and while I didn't actively journal, I did vent quite often. It's something I started when I was 12, and while I wasn't consistent, I had a few different diaries where I randomly wrote stuff. \n\n2 years ago, my mum, sibling and I relocated to our home country where I went to University, and my dad stayed back overseas for his work. It's worth noting that I grew up in several countries around the world, and spent around 5 years in the country where my dad is currently working. \n\nThe physical distance, and growing up on both our parts did wonders to my relationship with my parents. While it isn't perfect, it's slightly less toxic than before. Well, I'm currently visiting my dad after 2 years and about an hour ago, when I was going through my cupboard, I found that the few journals I did leave behind were completely destroyed. All the pages where I had written anything were torn and only the empty book/ sleeve remains. I am absolutely horrified because a) They never asked me before they did it and b) Tearing specific pages where I had written personal stuff DEFINITELY means that they read it to some extent. \n\nThis isn't the first time they're violating my privacy either. When I was in highschool, they would constantly read my messages and snoop through my phone. On one occasion, I have also caught my mom attempting to read my diary. I don't know how many times they've done that in my absence. Their justification was that in light of all my mental health and SH issues, they just wanted to \"keep an eye\" on me. It didn't matter where I hid it, they'd always find my phone/ diary. They knew my passwords and had access to everything. Being back and seeing this stuff is bringing back a lot of old memories and resentment. \n\nI don't even know if I should bring this up because I know they'll either deny it, try gaslighting me like they've done before, or just straight up accuse me of being ungrateful. I'm leaving to a new continent for work, vv far from home, in two months and may not be able to visit home at least for another three years, so I don't know if I should unnecessarily stir the pot now or just let it be. But I'm just so so angry about the blatant lack of respect they have for me. I love my parents very much and don't want to lose them, but I'm so tired of the constant manipulation, lying and disregard for my emotions. I have no idea what to do anymore, and I feel like the same broken and vulnerable child I was all those years ago. I have no one to confide in about this, and I just feel very resentful and lost right now. \n\nIf you've gotten this far, thanks for reading. I just needed to vent.",

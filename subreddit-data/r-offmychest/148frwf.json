    "postText": "I'll try not making it too long. This guy, let's call him Jim, just for the sake of simplicity. Jim is the kind of guy knowing to sleep around a lot and brag about girls, he also brags about married women hitting on him, suffice to say he's got a big ego and he likes the attention. I am in a serious relationship with a girl who is in our friends groups, she and Jim had a fling some years ago, but ever since he learned that we were together, he tries to make distasteful comments then laughs about it, no one else finds it funny and people tag me whenever he says something stupid so I can call him out.\n\nJim is also a compulsive liar, his step father used to drop him at work, but once caught him leaving his workplace from the back doors of the establishment, he had been fired and lied about work. After caught, he would flee from his mum's place. He did it twice, asked for money from our friends and never gave it back, we then learned he was buying stuff for his then girlfriend.\n\nJim got a new girlfriend a year ago, he said he was getting on his tracks as he was studying and found a new job. Cool, we thought he might have been trying to change. In the last year he's been absent from the group and a bit distant from his gf's life (he said work and studies were taking all of his time), we then learned that she was undergoing a fertilisation treatment as they wanted to marry and have a child, we thought it was great because Jim grew up without a father and always said he wanted to be one. She's been pregnant for 6 months.\n\nLast week, Jim's girlfriend wanted to make a surprise and see him at work since he works in a shopping mall. She caught him holding hands and kissing another girl, the girl had a bunch of flowers in her hand (it was near Valentine's day where we live). Jim's girlfriend snapped, she slapped him and passed out from stress, then Jim proceeded to leave with the girl he was with and left her there. Jim's girlfriend had to ask for the security guard's help.\n\nJim's girlfriend also wanted to talk to him afterwards, he never gave her his address, but since he ordered a couple of things from the internet and she had some receipts, she found his address and knocked on his door, his step father answered, and she went inside. His mum didn't know who she was, and didn't know Jim was to be a father, and she panicked. Jim's mum said she knew he was seeing a blonde girl, but Jim's girlfriend said the girl he was with at the shopping mall had dark hair, so it was a third one.\n\nI am struggling not to hate Jim, we've never really got along, but right now, I want him as distant as possible.",

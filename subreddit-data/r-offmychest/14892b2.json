    "postText": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m 16F and I have social anxiety that is kinda turning into agoraphobia and that is scaring the crap out of me. I got prescribed lorazepam and Zoloft for that but I am scared as hell to take either of them. It\u2019s summer now and I\u2019m in summer school. I have no friends. In regular school because of social anxiety I didn\u2019t have friends. My parents are very strange and not like other parents all. My mom is mentally disabled and basically sleeps all day now. My father and I have never had a great relationship and when he\u2019s home I just feel uncomfortable because he\u2019s extremely passive aggressive and is a raging alcoholic. When I hear the door close when he goes to work I just feel so relived. I used to be close with my sister but then she started to get so toxic so we don\u2019t speak anymore. Now my life consists of waking up, doing summer school, contemplating taking the drugs or not , staying in my room all day online, begging my mom to spend time with me because I\u2019m so lonely and all she says is I\u2019m tired leave me alone. I feel like a such a worthless pathetic human being. I want to change. Also I\u2019ve had this therapist but it turns out she was actually a horrible therapist and it ended with her screaming at me . So yea I feel pretty hopeless right now . The no friends and difficult family are really affecting me I just feel that I\u2019m wasting my youth which is killing me inside. Somebody please help.",

                    "comment": "you\u2019re right but the problem is I\u2019m so pathetic . In social situations people are just mean to me and It\u2019s just so hard for me to defend myself. I feel like I\u2019m a target and I don\u2019t know why. I feel like people can notice the social anxiety and then I\u2019m immediately treated differently and if just makes me feel trapped. It just feels like no matter where I go I\u2019ll be bullied and targeted and left out and treated differently and I\u2019m sick and tired of it. It\u2019s not fair at all. It makes me hate people and want to avoid them. Which I know is literally not helping my situation at all but I didn\u2019t make it that way. People did. It sucks.",

If they don't help, your doc can try different ones or different dosages. \n\nI was scared to start my anxiety meds, but what they did was make me feel like me again. I was lucky and the first med was what I needed. Sometimes you need a different one, but you won't know until you try.",

Yes some people can be buttholes but you shouldn\u2019t let there outlook on you make you feel that way. I feel you are a great person and people will love you once then get to know you. There are other people that feel like you that need friends as well. Just gotta connect with some of them.",

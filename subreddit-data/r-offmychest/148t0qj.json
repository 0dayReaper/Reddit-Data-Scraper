Iv\u2019e always had a porn addiction and always treated reddit users (pics/videos) like porn. What should i do? It was 11 days after getting with my gf, after that i remember deleting the chat because i had my gf but i found out about it today, iv\u2019e never roled played with her or messaged any girl the same way before. What should i do?",

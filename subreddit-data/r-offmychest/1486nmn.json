    "postText": "I\u2019m a little freaked out but i accept what\u2019s happened and am going to do whatever i can to be the best mom i can be. I don\u2019t know much about pregnancy. Or kids to be honest. I have bipolar 1 and am worried about the process of getting off my medication. And concerned about how difficult it might be to cope without meds. \n\nMy boyfriend (33m) is on board with the pregnancy and says he will be with me every step of the way. \n\nI have reached out to my psychiatrist and have an appointment scheduled with my doctor on Thursday.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just looking for some words of encouragement, I\u2019m a bit lost atm and don\u2019t really know what to expect from pregnancy in general. \n\nAll i know is that my nipples hurt real bad.",

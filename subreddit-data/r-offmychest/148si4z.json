    "postText": "Attended a funeral for a person I thought would outlive me. It\u2019s almost unreal the feeling. I have anger and so much sadness. How could they let alcohol take them completely. They were stronger than that. I wish I could have taken the pain away. I wish they knew how much they were loved, and by so many people. They had such a kid-like spirit, so beautiful. It\u2019s always the good ones that get taken away. It feels empty without you here\u2026 I\u2019m gonna miss your laugh and side comments. I\u2019m gonna wish you were here to see everything. I wish I got one last hug in. My perspective on life and people has shifted a bit.",

    "postText": "And I felt nothing but relief. I\u2019ve been there for 15 years, have been through countless changes, restructures, re-orgs, etc., and have seen it get worse and worse. I\u2019ve been completely mentally checked out for 5 years. I still did my job, and I did it well, but I didn\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t give any extra. I had no passion. \n\nWhen I got the news yesterday, I just said \u201cokay\u201d and asked about my severance. That was all I cared about. I was excited to not have to go to my meetings, and to not have to answer 3000 dumb questions. I spent the rest of my work day hanging out with my mom and gardening. \n\nI am of course worried about finding a job with comparable pay and benefits, but for today, I am just enjoying the freedom, and looking forward to a new start and getting my passion back.",

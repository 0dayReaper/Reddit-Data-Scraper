    "postText": "To people all around the world, \n\nWe, Hongkongers just experienced a terrorist attack planned and executed by our Hong Kong Police Force. At about 10pm today, our police force rushed into our railway system in Prince Edward station, got in to the carriage and indifferently beat up all the people in it regardless they are protesters or simply passengers. They ignored the weapon guidelines and fired tear gas indoor in the carriage which is in fact lethal. Also, they beat up innocent people causing them seriously wounded. Some passengers kneeled before them asking them to stop but the response they got were beaten ever harder. Meanwhile, the police haven\u2019t arrested the passengers after they got beaten up, showing that the only purpose of their brutality was to sort their anger to violence but not dispersing the crowd. \n\nWe, Hongkongers are experiencing a humanitarian crisis and we hope that people all over the world can help us in anyways you can think of. Thank you and we will stay strong.\n\nHongkongers\n\n*Edit: thank you guys for all the support! I can\u2019t thank you enough for your support and concern. Your kind words gives us strength to keep going! Please just keep paying attention to how things go, and help us spread awareness!*\n\nEdit (20/9/19) : Thank you, dear redditors! I never imagined I\u2019d still be receiving messages about this post to this day! Please read this report on police brutality by the International Amnesty, and continue to support us! https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/d6mmou/report_on_police_brutality_by_the_amnesty/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nThank you for the awards!! Kind strangers! \n\nFight for freedom, \n\nStand with Hong Kong!!",

Tear down this metaphorical Berlin Wall of mainland Chinese acts of oppression and acts of terrorism against a people who seek after the same values we hold so dear.",

(Make sure to change the name to the name of your senator)\n\nHello, Mrs. Cantwell I am writing you today to urge you to support S. 1838 To Amend the Hong Kong Policy Act. As I'm sure we both know, the Police of Hong Kong committed egregious acts of violence on protesters on Saturday August 31. This attack on protesters was completely unnecessary and was only committed to intimidate citizens from protesting. When the Police of Hong Kong shut down the metro system and invaded the trains, their only goal was to use excessive force on the citizens who were on their daily commute. No one was arrested after these acts of violence, showing that the Police were there to cause harm- not to disperse \"malicious protesters\" as they have claimed. I implore you to support S. 1838 so that the citizens of Hong Kong can feel safe once again and have autonomy over the government of China. This issue is not only about police brutality, but also to ensure that the citizens of Hong Kong maintain the Democracy of their country and will not be held under the authoritarian regime of China. Thank you for your time and please consider convincing your fellow senators to take action on the human rights crisis of Hong Kong.",

Most, if not deprived or abused, will amass a considerable (but not unlimited) reservoir of hope. Hope for safety and care as a child while maturing, hope for having good friends, hope for love and validation from his present and future family, hope for achieving life goals, and hope for having a close relationship with God. These are seemingly things all children should receive but not all do. Some do navigate childhood without a striking depletion of this reservoir of hope. They are fortunate and probably will have the confidence to achieve their life goals when others don't. Firstborn children seem to have this particular advantage.  Nevertheless, most have enough hope left\u00a0to also navigate life without it's depletion. Some though may be further depleted of hope from time to time during life (death of someone loved, disappointment in achieving life goals, trying physical illness, betrayal in family, after having been betrayed by many in life, being betrayed by ones that are the persons's \"last hope\" and then perhaps believing God has failed them or doesn't care) and after time all the hope that they conserved as babies is at last depleted. At that time, it may be that the desire for life ends in their heart. Not that they want their life to end, but that they don't care whether their life continues anymore. Thus their reasoning may start to turn inward becoming selfish.",

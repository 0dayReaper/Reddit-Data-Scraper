    "postText": "My ex boyfriend and I lived together for two years and had an okay relationship. We never really fought and we had a lot of fun together. It took me until after we broke up but I realized our relationship was never that great. He ignored me, shut me out emotionally, detached from me constantly. He was selfish. Or guarded. Or both. Anyway, he went on a trip out of the country and sent me a photo that revealed he was messaging a female coworker of his. She was telling him about her emotional issues, traumas, troubles with relationships. And I had no idea this was going on. He admitted to it but immediately deleted all of her texts. At least one of which I know was a photo from her. Of what? No idea. But he insisted they were just friends and I was ruining his trip for \u201cconstantly\u201d asking for reassurance. (I dropped it more easily than I should have upon discovery and asked him to block her the next day. That\u2019s all I brought up. To which he refused, by the way). He promised to stop talking to her and I told him not to tell her why. When he got back from his trip and got back to work, he told her the only reason he wasn\u2019t talking to her was because of me. He probably said it as an apology no doubt. Long story short, he claimed over and over that they were just friends and gaslit me into thinking I was the crazy one and that I was being controlling\u2026 until he broke up with me. And slept with her a few days later. Now, months later, my Spotify AI DJ tells me my friend has been listening to the same song I have been lately.. Traitor by Olivia Rodrigo. Guess what friend? My ex. I wonder if he sees himself in that song. Or if he\u2019s still so unwilling to admit the fault he\u2019s done that he\u2019s oblivious. \u201cI know that you\u2019ll never feel sorry for the way I hurt.\u201d Part of me wishes I could talk to him but I know it would undo all the progress I\u2019ve made trying to move on. I really really loved him and he never loved me the same. It\u2019s such a hard thing to come to terms with. Knowing that there\u2019s at least a slim chance he may empathize with me.. I don\u2019t know if it makes me feel better or if it just hurts. Or if maybe she\u2019s riding shot gun in his car now and she\u2019s the one playing the song because she likes the way it sounds.",

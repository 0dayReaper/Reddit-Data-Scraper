    "postText": "So I am close to finishing university and did an internship in a great company with great people last semester to which I would have loved to return to. Let\u2019s call it company A. However, getting back in proves to be difficult. \n\nWhile still being friends with a lot of people there, I decided to apply for jobs in the area to see them off work and potentially reapply for suitable positions. \nSo far this has not been going too well. \n\nI did get invited to one round of interviews at a nearby company for a traineeship but that also did not work out. Let\u2019s call this one B. Surprisingly, the HR person in charge reached out and sent me an email which \u201esuggested\u201c a Junior position instead. For me and others I shared the text with, this sounded like a job offer. \n\nIn the meantime, someone from company A reached out and asked me if I wanted to cover while someone else is on parental leave for 5 months. Obviously, I would have said yes in a heartbeat but having a permanent job offer from company B where the people also seemed to be great, accepting a temporary position simply seemed like an irrational decision. \n\nNot even two days later my friend from company A tells me that they probably found someone already which I was happy to hear about. \n\nFast forward another few days and I have another meeting with people from company B. However, it turned out to be a completely new job interview as if the first multiple hours applicants day did not happen. What does not help is that from my POV the interview went poorly. \n\nSo now, thanks to unfortunate wording in the HR mail I declined the temporary job at my favorite company and bombed an interview I wouldn\u2019t even had considered taking if I had known about the nature of it. I do know now I should have reached out to the HR of company B to clarify any misunderstandings. \n\nWhat bothers me the most is that I was so short-sighted in making the decision. A lot of people I met at company A started as a cover and ended up staying. \n\nI just feel so terribly stupid and sad about this. I wish I could go back and just accept the offer even if it was just for a few more months, I could stop hunting jobs for at least a little bit. My chest hurts whenever I think about it because THIS was my chance and I threw it away. The worst is that I am constantly questioning myself what I was thinking. I wanted to play it safe but messed up even bigger. \n\nHere ends my rambling about me being an idiot, thanks for reading!",

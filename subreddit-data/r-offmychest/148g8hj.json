    "postText": "I have moved a lot within the same area and frequently have to visit the reviews of potential places I wanna live and I'm moving again soon.\n\nThe thing is, I'm moving back into an old place possibly so I was looking at the reviews and they're nuts. Mostly 5 star, but the 1 stars are so insane and make no sense because I remember living there and I know this side of town. It's nice and pretty crime free and it's also expensive to live. I used to live in a pretty bad neighborhood, like you'd know how bad it is just looking at a picture of it. Hookers and drugs everywhere shootings you name it.\n\nHowever these one star reviews for apartments in nice and expensive areas (it wasn't just this complex but I see these kinds of reviews in every complex reviews) yet the reviews say things like \"CONSTANT SHOOTINGS\" \"drug dealing rampant!!\" And \"cars are always broken into\" which perplexes me cause I've seen these for places I've lived in, and never saw or heard anything like that in my life in this whole part of the city. I even lived near the specific area the reviewer was talking about. Are these people just hearing fireworks and freaking out?? Do apartments campaign against each other and write fake reviews? What the heck is going on??",

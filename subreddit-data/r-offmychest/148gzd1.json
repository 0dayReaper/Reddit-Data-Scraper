    "postText": "My dad just died Sunday. For years I always thought when my parents died, preferably 10-20 years from now, that I would probably have either been dead or would've joined them shortly after. You left too soon dad, you left way too fucking soon. You always talked about how I'd be a man and I'd have to handle everything but you also always said 10-15 years. You didn't say fucking Sunday, you didn't tell me \"hey today's the last day, let's make the most of it.\" I could've smoked with you one more time, watched a movie, anything.  You didn't keep your end of the deal dad. You left a half baked son, not a fucking man here. You had shit to do, concerts, movies, albums. Shit to fucking do dad. We had shit to do and now I don't know how I'll make a month without you. I know he won't ever see this but he was my only real friend, he was supposed to do alot more shit with me, so much more. I wonder through this house seeing a fucking ghost of you everywhere, your drum set, your couch seat, everywhere. We had so much shit to do together and you left me, mom and sis here drowning together. You kept us afloat and now we are drowning. I miss you so much, you have no fucking clue just how much we miss you. I would set the entire fucking world on fire just to have 5 more minutes with you.",

            "comment": "I remember when my dad died when I was 13, I had a similar situation of being thrusted into adulthood too early. I didn\u2019t like my father back then, I barely knew him. After several years of digging though I discovered all the things he did for us, I grew a fondness of him, and I started to miss him as I became a real man. I\u2019d give anything to be able to go fishing with him one more time, actually tell him what I did at school one day, or just sit and listen to some of his favorite music from the 80s. I was a child, I didn\u2019t know that eventually I would cherish my father, and that it would be too late. But it is, and that fact will never go away. I had the privilege of telling him I loved him on his death bed (which was a blatant lie at the time), so I at least sent him off with kind thoughts, but if I had any chance, any opportunity, to tell it to his face now when I mean it, I would. You\u2019ll make it through this, brother. We\u2019re all here for you, and your family will share this burden as well, you won\u2019t have to go through any of this alone.",

Stage 4 lung cancer. He was on a bipap machine and I told him I love him and thank you for everything. That machine was so loud I hope he truly heard me. I still deal with it quietly because my husband doesn\u2019t like him so I have to cry by myself. I\u2019d like to think that they know how much we love them so much so they are always around us. I have dreams of him that are so realistic and that makes me happy. I hope your dad comes to you in your dreams. Wishing you all the strength to continue on for your mom and sister. Take all the advice he gave you and become the best man you know he would want you to be. Thank you for sharing.",

It will get easier to handle, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any easier without them. \n\nIt\u2019s been almost 6 years for me, and I still get angry at my dad for dying when I was 25. He wasn\u2019t at my wedding, he\u2019ll never know my kids, and most importantly he won\u2019t see me become what he always knew I would be, a lawyer. But I believe he\u2019s still with me, it\u2019s just his physical form is gone. I find dimes when I need him the most. I talk to him when I\u2019m alone. \n\nPlease take care of yourself during this emotional traumatic time. Drink some water and eat some protein.",

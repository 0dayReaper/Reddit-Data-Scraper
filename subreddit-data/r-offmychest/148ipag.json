    "postText": "My life sucks. I move to the US, after graduating college. I have a crappy job that pays me crap. It's discouraging to learn that other people my age make $20-30k more just because they chose another career. I'm about to finish an MBA and considering doing a MS in Data Science to change careers but no one wants to hire me. I'm considered a \"top performer\" and just got a promotion and still getting paid shit. Last year I was working two jobs to break even.\n\nMy girlfriend has a really good career and is ready to move to the next step of buying a car, house, etc. But I'm not, I'm just holding her back. I have been having interviews but rejected from every position.\n\nI feel like I sacrificed a lot for nothing, I feel like a complete failure. As I'm writing this, my job is telling me that I will need to go to the office on Friday nights and Saturday morning to give \"career workshops\" to clients (no extra pay) its so ironic.",

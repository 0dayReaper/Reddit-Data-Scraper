    "postText": "Hello, I'm pretty desperate ...\n\nI've been with my partner for a year and a half and everything is going very well except for one thing ...\n\nOne week after we got together, he got covid and it took a very long time for him to get over it. I think he had/has long covid.\n\nOne of the repercusions is his libido. He barely has libido. Mine is significantly higher, which is okay, I respect his very low sex drive and I never say anything when he tells me that he is too tired. He even told me that he wants to get his hormones levels checked.\n\nThe thing is, I discovered that on days that we are not together/when he is home and me at work, he visit porn sites. He picks specific thing that he likes and that we do together. Specific actresses. And he can go on them two times a day. If we spend a few days without seeing each other, you can be sure he will have a visit on a porn site.\n\nFirst of all, I don't know how I feel about him actively going on these sites and though barely touches me in a sexual way (we are very tactile though, lots of hugs and kisses and etc). I don't understand what I don't have, if i'm not pretty enough ... why does he turn me down and says it's because he is too tired but during the day, basically faps on a porn site. \n\nI feel very defeated, i don't know how to tell him about my discovery. I feel bad about it but i also can't help but feel emmotionaly cheated on. I would not feel the same way if we had a regular sex life.\n\nI feel sad because I am very cautious so that he feels confortable with sex and I don't want him to feel bad because of his issues ... but now I am questionning myself...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need advices because it makes me very sad.",

I tried to have this discussion a few times, he tell me it\u2019s not me and he doesn\u2019t really understand. I was okay with this until I discovered the porn thing.",

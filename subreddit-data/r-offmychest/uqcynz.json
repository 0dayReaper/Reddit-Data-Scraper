    "postText": "I started student teaching in a 4th-grade special ed class in September. My teacher told her students that if all 12 of them get 100% on their spelling tests, we can have a pizza party. So far, that has not happened yet. This past Monday, my teacher told them \u201cThis is Ms. K\u2019s last week with us. Let\u2019s all work really hard to finally get that pizza party.\u201d The kids were really excited. During their free time, they would all study their words. I never saw them work so hard.\n\nWhat makes this situation difficult is the bullying between Gabby and Sam. Sam has severe dyslexia and struggles with spelling. Gabby constantly picks on Sam for it. My teacher and school take this seriously and intervenes. However, Gabby still picks on Sam.\n\nAfter my teacher said \u201cLet\u2019s all work really hard to finally get that pizza party,\u201d Gabby shouted back \u201cCan you make sure that Sam studies since she\u2019s really bad at spelling?\u201d We addressed this with Gabby. Even though she is only 9, she pisses me off with her passive-aggressive comments. Sam practiced really hard for the spelling test. I even stayed after school Thursday to help Sam study.\n\nOn Friday morning right before the test, she was crying because she didn\u2019t want to be the only student to fail and ruin the pizza party. I told her that she worked so hard this past week and she is smart.\n\nFor the spelling test, our teacher will say the spelling word out loud and the students will write it. 11 of the students have the same words. Sam has a slightly different set of words which are a bit easier. My teacher whispers Sam\u2019s words to her. When the teacher does this, Gabby will sometimes snicker. I can\u2019t fucking stand this. We addressed this before, but Gabby still doesn\u2019t change her behavior.\n\nI finally lost it. This past Friday, Gabby snickered again. I went up to Gabby and angrily whispered \u201cI will take your test and fail you right now if you don\u2019t stop. And you will ruin the pizza party for everyone. Stop it.\u201d She started crying in her seat. I didn\u2019t care. Maybe it will finally get through to Gabby.\n\nOnce the kids are done, I walk around and collect all the tests. The kids go to lunch, and my teacher gives me the tests to grade. She leaves for lunch duty. I start grading each test and it's 100% after 100%. I am so proud of my students. I get to Gabby\u2019s test and it's 100%. I finish grading and every single test is 100%. I feel so proud and excited for them. But then I realize, I only collected 11 tests. Sam\u2019s test is on my teacher\u2019s desk.\n\nI go through her test and she is spelling all the words correctly. I never felt so proud. But then, it hits me. The very last word which is always a \u201cchallenge word\" is spelled wrong. She wrote \u201cbecause\u201d as \u201cbecuase\u201d. I am still proud of her because she got 9/10 correct. She never scored that high before. And sight words are very challenging. But all the students will figure out that Sam \u201cruined\u201d the pizza party for them. Even if we don\u2019t announce who failed, they will figure it out.\n\nI could talk to my teacher about letting them have the pizza party anyway- but my teacher is a stickler for the rules. \u201cEveryone needs to get a 100%.\u201d I can\u2019t let Sam feel like a failure or get bullied. So, I erased the \u201cu\u201d and the \u201ca\u201d and switched them. Sam probably won\u2019t notice. And I won\u2019t tell Sam or she will feel bad. She will eventually learn how to spell \"because\". I need her to have her moment.\n\nThe kids came back from recess and were told the good news. They were so excited. Sam was so proud of herself! I come back on Monday for the pizza party!",

But the wall is only 10 feet away, I'll learn nothing about them. If I put the wall 100 feet away then it is more clear to me. Honestly one of the best teachers I've ever had but God damn it was brutal. I was a midrange student but seeing the people at the top of the class walk away feeling destroyed with \"just a b\" was hard to watch. There was even a test that almost  everyone failed and had to be extremely curved.  tying a pizza party to grading seems like a bad idea in this scenario. Just give it to them!",

Spellcheck is his lifesaver, and in reality most professional adult communications have spellcheck.\n\nI'm in grad school to become a professor (research focused on education inequality actually), have a 4.0 at an elite college, etc. and this is 100% the reality. No one could give a fuck about a spelling error here or there, least of all education professors well aware of ableism and other issues that permeate in formal education. And once you get to a certain level in academia, everyone with a PhD just wants to be called by their first name, are flexible and understanding of their students, and are not at all sticklers for little things. Leave that shit in elementary school where it belongs (not that it even belongs there). The research says instructors who act like that only serve to dissuade their students from trying, discourage them, etc. They bore the conventionally successful kids/don't earn their respect, and they stand to hurt the rest of the kids' perception of school for life. That's just got horrifying implications for life, as I'm sure you know.",

He gave me a C that I didn't earn on paper.\n\nIt's educators like you that encourage students to work hard and continue to love learning - even on the worst days.

Specifically because it can lead to bullying like whet you describe happening in your class. But also because it feels like the kids on par feel punished for someone else\u2019s academic results. If there is a group reward it should be based on things like behavior. At my school we do quarterly pizzas parties for each grade based on which class did the best at keeping their area of the lunch room clean. So even kids who do poor academically can help the group succeed. And it also promotes personal responsibility in the lunch room while making cleaning up between lunch periods so much less work for staff. If a teacher insists on giving a pizza party based on test outcomes the teacher at least should give it based on meeting an average score requirement like say collectively the class scores like a 95% or higher on a specific test. That way there is wiggle room for the kids with specific issues (like dyslexia).",

Also, it seems to me like this situation actually fosters a hostile environment where kids will be more likely to bully others because they lose out on something from someone else not being perfect at school. Nobody is perfect, I know grown ass adults that can't seem to spell with spellcheck. I teach high school and have students who misspell words all the time (i teach math so i never take off points). If I were to have a competition where the standards were that high my students would never achieve it and it would be devastating and lead to them doing worse not better. She (the teacher) needs to learn about proper expectations. Perfect behavior, thats fine, perfect scores on a test, absolutely not okay.\n\nIm proud of you for what you did because honestly it makes it so that the kid (and the others) have motivation to keep trying and working hard. This shows them that their hard work pays off. If they didn't get it it would show them that hard work doesn't matter bc its impossible to succeed and we should NEVER instill that in children, especially at that age.\n\nOne last thing, FUCK that teacher, I hope my daughter never has a teacher like that.",

The uni had given her extra programs to help with her dyslexia and typos, but I helped with the ones it would miss as I used to write for fun. Unfortunately though, she doesn't have a full diagnosis - a classmate in college had suggested it, and the college only did enough tests to get her help in exams and stuff, but stopped short of a diagnosis, so unfortunately now she's done with education (for now) she can't get any help. It's a bit of an odd situation. \n\nI'm glad there are those in this thread with a better experience than the kid in OP's story, that there are those in a position to help, and I hope the kid's experiences get better as time goes on too.",

We have had my son exempted from spelling tests since the first grade because they are something he is never going to pass. Even if the child remembers how to spell the words in the short term, the odds are good that they forget in the long term and have just stressed themselves sick for nothing.",

You could have her go to another classroom during the party, so as not to rub it in.  9 is not too young for some real-life consequences for poor behavior.

It's a painful lesson to learn. \n\nI teach martial arts and have a lot of students who are special needs. Some of my more (physically) sensitive students need to understand how contact sports work and learn how to deal with sensory discomfort. I push them very hard, but as someone with sensory issues and low pain tolerance I understand what they're going through. However, I have made a kid cry before because I told him over and over - if you act like you're hurt every single class but you're actually not, eventually us teachers will become desensitized to his actions of \"pain\". Boy-who-cried-wolf. So when he actually got kicked during sparring class (by a kid that I trust to not kick hard) and started tearing up, I reminded him of that lesson. Yes, he started crying. But...he needed to learn. \n\n(And don't worry. He sparred with my assistant twice after that. He left the class smiling.)",

That's putting entirely too much pressure on all of them.  Because even if it wasn't Sam... Say 1 kid other than Sam spelled one word wrong.  Even if none of the other kids know who it was, that kid will know.  And they will be down on themselves for ruining it for everyone else.  \n\nHorrible, piece of shit teacher.  Bless you for doing something good for that class.  You should be the full on teacher instead of the student teacher.  And good on you for putting Gabby in her place!",

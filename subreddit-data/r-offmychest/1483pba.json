    "postText": "I have a poster of the lead singer of Linkin Park, Chester Bennignton, in my room and when my mom came in the other day she asked me who it was and I said Chester from LP, and she responded \"oh the guy who killed himself?\" and was kinda joking/laughing about it and I just said yeah and laughed along, but in my opinion its really fucked how someone who was so talented and special (or anyone not just him) has been dwindled down to his suicide. Idk her response just really bothered me and ik I'm probably being really sensitive about this bc Chester and Linkin Park have helped me through things and are super important to me, and I struggle with suicidal thoughts and shit like that too (my mom doesn't know so she wasn't being crazy insensitive) but I thought it was just kinda fucked that was her response, it felt like she was just being super disrespectful and it was kinda fucked up.",

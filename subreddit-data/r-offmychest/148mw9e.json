    "postText": "I just have to share this with someone because it\u2019s been on my mind. I have no idea how to even start writing this. I\u2019m writing this from a throwaway account. For some background I\u2019m 26 trans male(pre-surgery) I\u2019ve always considered myself bisexual, and I have been with my girlfriend for a year and a half. She\u2019s an amazing person and we have a great sex life. She\u2019s even used a strap-on on me and it\u2019s fucking hot. We have a great time every time. Even though all of that is amazing, I still find myself thinking and fantasizing about having sex with men. Some of the fantasies are a little out there too. I don\u2019t know what to do about anything. Just wanted to tell someone.",

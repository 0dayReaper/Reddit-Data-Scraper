    "postText": "For most of the last year, I was in a toxic and abusive relationship.\n\nThere were always red flags, but it didn\u2019t get really bad until a few months in. She was completely unpredictable; on any given day she could be the most loving and sweetest girl, but there was equal chance she\u2019d be explosively angry, or completely cold.\n\nI\u2019d wake up at a 10/10 stress level because I didn\u2019t know what each day would bring. Anything could set her off, and I\u2019d spend my days fully wound up because I was readying myself for the next set of hurtful messages.\n\nThere was a lot of lies, a lot of gaslighting, and manipulation to spare. But I gave her the benefit of the doubt, over and over again because she\u2019s mentally unwell (at her own word), has experienced a lot of misfortune in her life, has substance issues, and above all because I loved her a lot. Look at me still making excuses for her :/\n\nThrough all this, I leaned on my friends for support, but really didn\u2019t get much from most of them. Granted, I did keep the worst of things to myself for the most part.\n\nMy best friend is the one I leaned on most, and looking back, I\u2019m not sure why. His advice to me was usually just \u201cleave her\u201d or \u201cthis is your own fault\u201d or \u201cyou should expect this by now\u201d.\n\nI wanted to leave badly, but felt that I couldn\u2019t. Towards the end, during my commute to and from work, I wrote essays worth of breakup messages. But every time I would be ready to send one, it\u2019d be one of the following:\n\nA) She\u2019d do/say something super sweet that would make me doubt my decision.\n\nB) She\u2019d tell me she was changing, or improving herself, or getting sober, etc. She\u2019d do the right things for a bit too. I desperately wanted to believe she\u2019d change, so I kept falling for it. \n\nC) She\u2019d threaten self-harm or suicide. This was the absolute worst and made me feel like leaving was not an option.\n\nThis was all complicated even further by her being a coworker (I eventually left the job).\n\nMy friend knew about C) and would just tell me \u201cit\u2019s not your responsibility\u201d which is nice and all, and an easy thing to say.. but if she did take her life after I left.. that would be something I\u2019d have to carry with me for the rest of my life (however long that\u2019d be). The pressure of feeling like you have someone\u2019s life in your hands is so immense, it\u2019s a horrible feeling having to weigh your own wellbeing against that of a loved one. \n\nI did end up leaving her after the worst blowup she had towards me. But even after reading the most gut-wrenching words, put together to hurt me in the worst way, the most unbearable pain came from having to let go.\n\nMy friend took it very personally that I didn\u2019t end things sooner. When I needed \u201cit\u2019s over now, I\u2019m here for you\u201d, I got \u201cthis is on you\u201d, \u201cyou should have listened to me\u201d, etc.\n\nStill, he offered me an ear to vent to and I took it. I tried to explain what went on, but was constantly interrupted by him making cruel comments or accusing me of lying. He eventually cut me off completely when I started to cry. Great friend.\n\nI tried to talk to him about it later, telling him that what he said was hurtful and that I wanted to talk about it so we could move on. I figured it was a misunderstanding, but it turned out that he\u2019d decided he didn\u2019t want to be friends anymore (but that he knows I\u2019m going through a tough time and is rooting for me lol).\n\nI have no idea how I\u2019ll tackle things with him. For her, it was *straightforward enough* to block her and move on. But with him, we\u2019re in groupchats together, we go on cottage trips as a group, play basketball as a group, go for breakfast as a group. I\u2019m so hurt by this, but I refuse to let him ruin the friendgroup for the others.\n\nWith both her and him, I never once lost my temper or said anything hurtful. I grew up watching my parents fight constantly, and despite being an easily angered person, I consciously make the decision to think and rethink everything I say, especially in emotional moments. \n\nBut I wonder if that was the right approach here. I\u2019m left now with so much anger that I can\u2019t shake. Part of me wishes I\u2019d said the scathing things in my head, but what would that accomplish?\n\nAfter what happened with my friend, I don\u2019t even feel comfortable talking to anyone about this, because I\u2019m terrified of things repeating. My sense of trust is very damaged right now.\n\nRationally, I can tell myself that this is their true character and that not everything that is lost is a loss\u2026 but in the span of a few days, I lost the woman I once envisioned marrying and the guy I thought could be my best man. It hurts so much.\n\nI can\u2019t even sleep well at night because all my dreams are about the two of them apologizing to me. How sad is that, I have to dream about something as simple and basic as an apology.\n\n______\n\nTL;DR: was in an abusive relationship, friend took it personally that I didn\u2019t leave on his timeline, and now I\u2019ve lost two of what I thought were the most important relationships in my life.",

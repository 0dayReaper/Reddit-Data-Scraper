    "postText": "So me and my girlfriend have a really good bond and we love spending time together and enjoy the same things generally but the biggest issue is the lack of affection. I have already communicated with her about how never having sex makes me feel depressed I don\u2019t try to feel that way I\u2019ve been trying to let go of my sex drive and make it go away but it hasn\u2019t been working and on top of that if I can\u2019t express my love for her that way then it kind of makes me a bit more clingy and touchy when we cuddle but she also hates that so it makes me feel very unwanted and like I can\u2019t help but be too much for her. I\u2019m doing everything I can to respect her boundaries and stop thinking of sex but it\u2019s depressing me and taking a toll on my emotions and I don\u2019t want it to be this way because she\u2019s absolutely amazing and I don\u2019t want to give up on what we have.",

It sounds like a lot of push pull going on here and I wonder if you both are having needs not met without realizing it. \n\nIf it only comes down to sex drive, then you may be fundamentally incompatible. Someone who never wants sex and someone who always wants sex are always going to struggle. No amount of compromise will make either party happy if the sex drives are that far apart. I\u2019m saying this as someone who spent seven years in an almost sexless relationship/marriage.",

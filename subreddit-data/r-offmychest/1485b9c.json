    "postText": "She cheated on me. I did return the engagement ring to her but she told me to keep the ring since she doesn\u2019t want any reminder of her mistake. We managed to remain friends since we have mutual friends and don\u2019t want to make things awkward for them.\n\nLater, my dog got cancer and my mom and dad wanted to put him down. They told me they would have him euthanized since he doesn\u2019t have that long left anyway and they don\u2019t want to spend the money on him. That\u2019s why I told them I will sell the ring I got from my ex and we can use that money to pay for the chemotherapy. My parents agreed to this but now they are complaining that I should have kept the money for other purposes instead.\n\nMy ex got really mad when she found out. I told her she has no business being upset since I already told her that I\u2019ll give it back to her but she didn\u2019t want it. She said it should have sentimental value to me. She also made me out to be some sort of bad guy to our friends. How do I deal with them all taking her side?\n\nUPDATE : I texted each of them and told them that since they are taking her side over me, I don\u2019t want to be friends with them anymore. I then texted my ex and told her I no longer care about her feelings, and that my dog is my number one priority. Then I blocked all of them so they can\u2019t bother me again. They are out of my life now.",

I gave it to some stoner kid randomly at an all night diner a year later.\n\n- first husband got me his great grandma's rose gold ring. I gave it back to his grandma because he was doing drugs when we split up.\n\n- second husband we just got silver bands from my friend's jewelry store.\n\nI don't think I've ever owned a ring that would go far covering medical expenses.

    "postText": "My (19) Dog died a few days ago and it\u2019s rough, she was 12 years old and a fat but Sweet Labrador.\n\nThe thing that pisses me off the most is that I\u2019ve been trying to get my parents to put her down for a couple of months, and they just brushed it off with \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it because it\u2019s sad\u201d\n\nTwo days before she died she stopped eating and I was begging them to take her to the vet so we could put her down. My parents finally agreed that it was time so they booked her in for the next day.\n\nThat night I needed to clear my head so I said my goodbyes to her and went out and didn\u2019t come back home until around 3am and found my dog dead in her bed, she wasn\u2019t breathing but she was still warm and fresh blood was pouring out of her mouth, I would\u2019ve been minutes late, I just wished I was their in her last moments to help her, I\u2019m so fucking pissed off my parents didn\u2019t put her down when I told them too. But I\u2019m pissed at myself that I decided to go out to clear my mind instead of staying with her.\n\nAnother part of me is annoyed with how much it\u2019s impacting me aswell.",

    "postText": "Please read my first post first if you haven\u2019t already. This is a part 2/update to it. \n\n(this is from part 1): i feel very guilty, anxious, sick and ashamed. i do not want to receive rude/mean comments or weird horny creeps, as i already feel awful. im aware there is probably something wrong with me. it\u2019s seriously fucked in the head. i know it\u2019s wrong. i\u2019m almost sixteen and i fear i won\u2019t even be able to enjoy my birthday because of how bad this has gotten. it almost feels like i can\u2019t even control it, like i\u2019m going crazy. \n\nI (16F) told my trusted friend (17NB) that i was having fantasies of a family member, and they reassured me and said i\u2019m probably just struggling with hormones, said they wouldn\u2019t judge me for it and that it\u2019s good that i\u2019m trying to get help. they understand i am ashamed and regretful. \n\nlike i said before, the fantasies started happening when i was about 13/14 during masturbation, mostly. I briefly remember feeling a little weird about it, but they kind of just kept happening. i don\u2019t remember feeling any actual attraction towards my mom at this time. a couple months ago, it randomly sunk in to my brain that i had sexually fantasized about my own mom. i started obsessing over it, and this is when i started getting actually aroused by my mother. \n\nthe first time it happened was when we were sitting on the couch watching TV. I was very anxious and ashamed and did not want to be around her, but she insisted on it and i didn\u2019t want to make her upset. she made some sort of sound, and me feeling very anxious and sensitive, i experienced a groinal response and arousal. i ended up masturbating once she left the room. i regret it.\n\nthe second time was when we were in the car. again, i was very anxious and still feeling very ashamed and on edge about my situation. i looked over at her and i got a groinal response and arousal again, but i just tried to ignore it. when i got home, i remembered it, and ended up masturbating to it on some massive impulse. \n\nim currently working on making this stop, but im having trouble living with myself out of sheer shame and self disgust. i can\u2019t enjoy things anymore. i feel like i don\u2019t deserve anything. i am fully aware that all of this is wrong and nothing similar has happened within the past few days. im struggling to find proper help for myself as well. i just feel stuck.",

            "comment": "It's said that if you masturbate over something enough you'll start to like it, try just resisting for a while and masturbating over other things to get back into the normal swing of things. If that doesn't work just accept that you have some sort of mother fetish and do whatever you wanna, it's weird but you can't exactly change what the body wants. Realistically if you ignore your interests in her and get off to other things you'll grow out of it, your friend is probably right, most likely just hormone stuff.",

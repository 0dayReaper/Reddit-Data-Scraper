    "postText": "My ex-boyfriend of a year and a half just recently blindsided me by breaking up over the phone at 1am. Besides the actual breakup, there\u2019s a lingering thought in the back of my mind that\u2019s eating me alive. When we were dating, during intimacy he admitted to me that since freshman year, he would look up photos of me on Instagram and get off to them (for context, I just graduated- we never really talked until junior year when we started dating). Photos of me in a bathing suit, in dresses, or even just smiling with my pets. I was caught in a fog of blind affection and initially found it endearing, but with post-relationship clarity hitting, I realized how weird and kind of creepy it is. \nHere\u2019s the thing: from what I know, any nude photos of me have been deleted from his phone- but that doesn\u2019t mean other photos have been. I feel gross thinking that the boy that broke my heart is still getting off to photos of me- and I don\u2019t know what to do.",

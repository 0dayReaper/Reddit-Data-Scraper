    "postText": "\nI (21f) live with my boyfriend (21m) in our own place. I moved out of my moms house when I was 17 years old, she was always a good mom in the sense that I always had food to eat, clothing to wear, and a roof over my head. With that being said I moved out because she has a drinking problem that has caused so much turmoil in my life. She becomes verbally abusive and lacks respect for others and their belongings when she drinks. She becomes destructive to her surroundings and herself. She is selling her house due to personal reasons and she has not found a place to go yet. I would never let her stay on the streets, her car, a hotel or air BNB, but I am stressed, overwhelmed and scared thinking about having to live with her even if it\u2019s just for a few weeks/months. I just know the backlash I will receive if I try and express my concerns, or try and implement a \u201csober\u201d rule. We have a good relationship now, I see her about once a week for a few hours and it\u2019s almost always out of the house so alcohol is not involved and if it is, it\u2019s a drink with dinner and then we part ways. I\u2019m worried what could happen to our relationship if I disagree to her staying, or try and enforce rules for my home. I have no one to turn to and talk about this, and I\u2019m scared to tell someone and have them not understand. I love my mom, but I want to be selfish and tell her she can\u2019t stay.",

Being an adult is knowing what you can handle and what you can't, and if you need to set a \"no drinking\" rule, then your mother can either respect that or make a plan for herself when it comes to where she is going to stay. If she's selling her house for personal and not financial reasons, she can home herself. You can love and support your mom, but she can also respect your feelings and concerns.",

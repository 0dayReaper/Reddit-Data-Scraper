    "postText": "I\u2019ve had one hell of a year. \n\nOn paper it\u2019s pretty normal stuff and one might say my life is actually pretty damn peachy. Good job, cute apartment, loving family and friends. I\u2019d also go as far to say above average attractiveness and intelligence which is validated by those around me. Beneath all that I\u2019ve struggled with depression and anxiety as long as I can remember. I held on decently well with a few breakdowns in high school and college, but then within this past year I\u2019ve descended further than I ever have. \n\nAnd the saddest/most pathetic part is that it was mostly triggered by a situationship falling through. I had never been more in love than I was with this person. Losing them has Sparta kicked me into this pit of hopelessness and just plain exhaustion. I\u2019m sick of trying to love, to live, let alone thrive in this life I know so many would be thrilled to have. That makes me feel even more pathetic. \n\nI\u2019ve been seeing a psychiatrist once a month and a therapist once a week. I\u2019m on two different antidepressants. I see a personal trainer twice a week. I write poetry sometimes, I paint, I hold my cat. I\u2019m fairly open with my loved ones about my struggles. I\u2019m trying. \n\nBut I\u2019m just so tired and sad. Most of the time I just want to lie in bed. Or cry. And I do both quite often. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can fake it til I make it. I\u2019m not particularly religious but if you feel like it please pray for me. Thanks for reading.",

And I had to realize that she probably didn't even grieve the loss of me. \n\nI alternate between anger and fantasies of what I wish I could say as confrontation, and tears on my cheeks, like minutes ago. She'll live to her final day without ever knowing how truly, deeply she was loved, and how close she came to having everything she'd searched for, but rejected it instead. She is in the arms of the man who cannot even see who he's holding. \n\nShe chose to be \"almost enough\" for someone else, instead of \"everything\" to someone who would have looked at her on his last day alive and still seen the most beautiful woman he's ever known. \n\nI'm not just sad for who and what I lost; I'm sad for her, that she lost a future where she'd be nurtured and patiently loved every day. I don't think she's every going to find that because she has a mental disorder that causes her to react destructively to being loved. Her entire life is going to be a decades-long story of how she *almost* let herself feel loved, once. \n\nI just got a fantastic new job, I'm healthy, I live in the most beautiful state int he country, I have two amazing sons...Like you, I have everything that a \"recipe\" for happiness should require. And yet, minutes ago...tears on my cheeks.",

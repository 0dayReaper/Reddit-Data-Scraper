    "postText": "I'm turning 25 in a few months and I haven't done anything with my life this far. And to be honest I don't know if I can turn things around at this point. I've gone back and forth from living with my parents to other family members when they get tired of me. Looking back to the past 7 years, all I can see are mistakes. \n\n\nI've fucked up in every way. Barely passed high school, dropped out of college, tried getting a \"real job\" but that didn't work out so I've been doing random gigs that don't pay nearly enough. Totally ruined my credit by running up balances and not being able to pay them, only have one friend and I can tell he's getting tired of me as well. I feel so empty. \n\n\nI mostly go on my PC all day and that's it. I told myself I would change years ago but I haven't. You'd think someone like me would eventually fix their situation because of how bad it is, yet here I am still not taking any action. I've missed out on my \"prime years\". Never had a girlfriend, never been to a party, never lived in a dorm or had my own place. \n\n\nI know what I need to do to fix this shit for the most part, but I don't think I have the willpower to do it. I regret so many things. I've wasted so much time. All those years down the drain and I have nothing to show for it. My parents could kick me out and even that probably wouldn't motivate me to get my shit together. I really wish I could care, but I have nothing to care about I guess.",

Google your most pressing thought about yourself and find a book relating to it. I promise it\u2019ll be the best thing you\u2019ve done for yourself. Don\u2019t even force yourself to read, you can listen too. Just focus and if it\u2019s becoming background noise rewind it and start again at a later date. I listen in the shower and when I drive. Trust me man if I can get a grip of my existence so can you. Break your bad habits. Make it a experiment to yourself. The reason you don\u2019t change is because you view change in a way of cause and reaction it doesn\u2019t only come from being sick of yourself. I used to feel that way too. You got it doggy but doing the same thing as always is just not going to net any different result yaknowski",

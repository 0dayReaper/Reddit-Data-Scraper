    "postText": "Recently we had a trip to my mom's hometown. While she is driving from bayan to my tita's house (where we are staying), she told me that she and her classmates used to walk to school everyday when she was in highschool. I think the distance is similar to Mendiola to Espa\u00f1a, there is paakyat and pababa pa in their way. So she didn't have much time to study when she got home because she was tired. I told her something na pajoke na lang, since I am not used to serious conversations like this with my parents. \n\nBut jokes aside, I understand now why my mom insists on making hatid-sundo to us back when were students. I was jealous of my classmates of having services come to pick them up and being with their friends. I begged my mom before to put me in bus services, but she always refused. \n\nNow I understand. This is one of the many things that is making sense on why my mom is like that to me and my brother. Overprotective sometimes, but there is always a reason. \n\nAlso to add, I am proud of my mom \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

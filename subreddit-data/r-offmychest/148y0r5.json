    "postText": "I live with my well off older parents in a big suburbia house where my dad still goes to an 8-5 job everyday and my mom spends all her time working on her ancestry hobby that I can\u2019t engage in because I\u2019m adopted.\u00a0 I spend each day in my room sleeping in, eating lunch silently with my mom, taking a nap or mindlessly scrolling for a couple of hours, eating a mostly silent dinner with my mom and dad, doing nothing for a couple of hours, say good night to them and then pretend to workout while I secretly get drunk and high for the rest of the night.\u00a0 If they\u2019re aware of my substance abuse they never have mentioned it and even if they tried I would just lie and deny.\u00a0 They\u2019re not abusive or anything, just lost in their own worlds and find my endless interest in the morbid and macabre somewhat distasteful and best not talked about. \u00a0I love them and they love me, just in a distant kind of way.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I don\u2019t have friends at all, not in real life, not online, not even imaginary; my only social interaction each day are brief awkward exchanges with my parents and anonymous comments I make on Reddit or Instagram where people sometimes like them.\u00a0 I have an older sibling that I use to talk to every week or so but they\u2019ve made wonderful progress in their career and personal life so I haven\u2019t really talked to them too much recently.\u00a0\n\nI say I want to be an artist or writer and I think I even have some good ideas.\u00a0 But because I\u2019m so alone with no direction and am unwilling to seek help for my addictions I end up doing nothing with near 24 hour free time except wallow and maladaptive day dream.\u00a0 I day dream about not existing entirely or being born to some fuck off rich family that would really allow me to be a weird antisocial leech for life.\u00a0 But mostly I day dream about when I\u2019m going to cover an empty room in tarp and blow my brains out onto it when I\u2019m older.\u00a0\n\nHonestly I see my life as one big cosmic joke where the setup is a short acne ridden lazy unconfident unmotivated half blind ghoulish drunkard is dropped into a perfect life with highly motivated charming ambition go getters as family.\u00a0 The funny part is watching this ghoul constantly struggle and fail to give even 1/32th of the energy and dedication to life despite everything being handed to him on a silver platter.\u00a0 The punchline is his suicide.\u00a0",

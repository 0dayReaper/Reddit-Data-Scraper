    "postText": "I hate it. \nI\u2019m not even half way and everything throbs, even my arms. I have to eat every hour, I want to go back to three meals a day. I don\u2019t want to be depressed anymore. I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m disabled, because for some reason I can\u2019t do shit. I can\u2019t even walk, I only waddle. It hurts to stand, sit and lay down. I keep having thoughts of leaving my husband because my pregnant friends husbands help them so much\u2026 draw a bath, massages, read books about being a first time dad, getting their wives simple things like a pair of knock off crocks because our feet swell and grow. Simple things.",

Postpartum depression is something lots of women are familiar with, but depression during pregnancy can definitely happen too! There is nothing wrong with hating being pregnant, but there are ways to help. I hope you start feeling better soon \ud83d\udc95",

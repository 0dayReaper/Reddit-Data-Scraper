    "postText": "You keep asking why i cut you off. Okay let me get this off my chest. You beat your husband for starters. Than you project you faults on to everyone. You scream about people being fake and lie. Yet everything you did was fake and a lie. You seriously came to my door and asked me why? Okay so here it is. You contacted my sons father. You think i didnt know!? The moment you heard we were repairing our friendship and coparenting way better you tried to bring up things we had already worked through. He and I both said terrible things to each other when we were hurt. We also said terrible things about each other. That we had already addmitted as well. Yet you tried to use that to keep us fighting!? WHY IN THE F WOULD YOU TRY AND MAKE OUR SONS LIFE UNSTABLE!!!!!!??? You think it was an attack on me yet if it had worked my son would have suffered!!!!!\n I get you a job at my place of buiness and right away you start spreading my life around. Funny thing is the stuff reported back to me was personal stuff i only told you and 1 other friend. That friend lives 3000 miles away and has never met our coworkers. \nThe friend you have convinced that i am so terrible you can keeo her. She  prefers drama and staying in a negative state of mind at all times. It why she didnt want to come to anything i hosted. Haha i dont give a crap about her or anything involving her because its true. I stepped away from her. She didnt even notice till you stirred the pot. I stepped away from you cut all contact yet you continue. You called my brother, you thought that your lies would sway my partner in life of 30 years!? He knows me better than i know myself. What did you think you where going to accomplish? \nAbout the cat, I called you for help. I told you something was wrong and nothing was working. Medication, vet visits, theropy. Once the tumor was found i knew i couldnt afford the right treatment. I addmitted to you I couldnt properly care for her and it destroyed me. The tears i shed about having to find someone who could afford treatment. How Fing dare you call me an animal abusor!? I have rescued so many animals and gave them safe places to live out there lives. But how em i suppose to choose 1 cat over my entire household!!! I can barly pay the mortage each month. I was suppose to make my family homeless for 1 cat!? I was suppose to rehome my other animals for her!? What was i supposed to do! put my son up for adoption for 1 cat!????? Was i suppose to put my disabled grandma and father on the street for the cat!!!!! I love her so much but i was faced with three options. 1. Makes us all homeless. 2. Let her suffer in pain for the rest of her days. 3. Rehome all my other pets and hope she survived anyways. It sounds heartless but i have a whole family to think about. I have other animals in my house that need me. So i asked for your help because I knew you would love her and care for her in the same way I did. I trusted you. I warned you that she was in bad shape. I explained all the issues and I told you how terrible i felt. Yet you still tried to tell everyone I am an animal abusor!? You said you understood you said you could afford the help she needed. I told you from the moment i seperated grom my ex that i might not be able to afford all my animals, and i had cut back on expenses. I cried to you about being a shit animal parent. That i shouldn have let my ex trest me like shit so i could continue to afford the animals. You said i would always have help. Help at a cost just like my mother. \ud83d\ude44\nSo you ask me why i cut you off. There it is i know EVERYTHING you said. Everyone at work and in our personal lives knows what kind of lying fake B you are. O here is the icing on the cake. That birthday party you were invited too. The birthday women asked me not to call you and remind you because she didnt want to spend her birthday with people who never gave a crap about her. Who had treated her like a back up friend. Do you realize before all this crap you made up and started you hadnt talked to her since last year? You never even called or text her on her birthday. Rant over",

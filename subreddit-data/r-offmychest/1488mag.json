    "postText": "My ex and I were together for 6 years.  And through those 6 years, we went through a lot, and I watched him grow as a person, and saw his good and bad side, and still loved him.  We have a 3 year old together, who requires care 24/7, due to a genetic condition.  Towards the end of our relationship there were a lot of arguments as he was starting to emotional cheat on me with women from his work, women he\u2019d be friends with on instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat.  When I\u2019d find out, he\u2018d get mad, start an argument, which would somehow be turned around to me causing him to seek emotional validation from other women because I don\u2019t build him up enough.    \n\n\nThis type of behavior went on for a year and only became worse when our child started to regress to to her genetic condition, and we didn\u2019t understand what was going on.  In January 2022, we decided to break up and amicably coparent together.  He at that time decided to go \u201dpreemptively\u201d move into his moms house, as we were both going to move out of our apartment when the lease was up.  While we still lived there, i was still trying to work things out with him, as a few days after the breakup he begged for me back, and said he would change.  I said I wanted to see the change first, then we would get back together, because I wanted to know he meant it.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn March, we both moved back into our parents houses, and since then I have been occupied with taking care of my kid.  I take her to numerous doctors appointments, therapies, and spend a lot of time caring for her.  I also decided to go back to school to get a job to better care for her as well as to get a place of my own.  My days are consumed with caring for my child, and studying in school.  I don\u2019t have time to date, nor do I honestly want to, as I\u2019m still in love with my ex.    \n\n\nFrom the time of our breakup to a few weeks ago, my ex would drop by randomly, to see our kid on day that wasn\u2019t his, to \u201ccheck up on her, and to see how I was doing as well.\u201d When he\u2019d stop by he\u2019d tell me that he\u2019s working on himself, and that he still cares for me, and maybe someday in the future we\u2019d get back together, but not right now, as he and I are at different stages in our lives, and he doesn\u2019t necessarily want what I want, just yet.  Things to make me hopeful that he wants me, and that he and I would be together again as a family.   \n\n\nTowards the end of May, my kid and I came back from a short trip, to which my sisters boyfriend told me my ex had posted a picture of his new girlfriend on instagram, with the caption, that he\u2019s so glad they don\u2019t have to secretly date anymore.  He and he have been together off and on since he and I split up.  When I went to talk to him about this, he said that I misheard/misinterpreted what he was telling me, that he and I are not together, and who he dates/what he does with his life is none of my business.   \n\n\nI\u2019m honestly hurt.  As hurt as when we first broke up, because I always expected him to change, and want to be a family, and help raise our kid together.  Instead, he\u2019s been dating someone else, raising her kids, buying them stuff and playing dad to them, while I take care of our daughter alone.  He\u2019s been taking his girlfriend out place, and doing things with her that I used to ask to do when he and I were together, but was told he couldn\u2019t because he was too busy.   \n\n\nI know that he\u2019s not going to change, or come back, yet I want him too. He was the person I could imagine growing old with, having multiple kids with.  I still love him, even though there are so many reasons not to. And I\u2019m still foolishly hoping that deep down he changes and will come back. ",

    "postText": "I\u2019m (30) married and have been with my husband (35) for three years. I dated a woman before I started seeing with him. I had been with women on previous occasions so that wasn\u2019t new, but her and I never worked out because of the timing and we saw each other for three months before she broke it off. I have spoken to her seldomly but I think she still has unresolved feelings for me. I know that a small part of me still wonders what if. I fell deeply in love with her over the three months (we were friends before that) and I fear that I may never fully get over her or stop wondering \u2018what if.\u2019\n\nI recently asked to get coffee to finally have some closure and talk things through. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bad idea or if it will be therapeutic. And if I do go through with this, how do I approach this conversation?\n\nHelp",

    "postText": "my dad and i have had a small granite shop for 6 years, 2 employees, just some guys from highschool. i was really tight with the one guy, even though he always had problems, sex addiction, always been stressed about everything, angry at every family member, he just doesn\u2019t understand social cues or something. has to spit on cars and always moves around, screams, has to be the center of attention, has a god complex. the list goes on right, but now he\u2019s become useless at the shop, being the fabricator at the shop, he thinks that\u2019s his only job, so he makes a mess and expects people to clean. then sits around, does his own pieces and literally plays with drum sticks for hours while the other employee and i get ready for the next install, organize, take inventory, clean, and basically do whatever we can to make my father\u2019s job of cutting slabs and getting jobs easier. but he\u2019s unapproachable so our conversation always turns into canning him, i just wish i could say \u201cdude you\u2019re making our jobs harder and you aren\u2019t worth 900 bucks a week anymore when you do the bare minimum and decide it\u2019s time to leave at 3 o clock every day when we run to 5\u201d, we don\u2019t have any communication anymore, that\u2019s been dead for a year of the past 4 he\u2019s been around. today all he wanted to do was make a granite sword, and he confessed that he jacks off 12 times every morning before work for whatever reason",

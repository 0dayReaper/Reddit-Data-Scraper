I feel like my family also doesnt think i have been successful or good, they also attribute everything ive had so to luck. I am a bad person, i just want to be a good and nice person that everyone one likes but im too off the rail for that ig. Im toxic , im a bad person. I want to get better, i want to improve, i just dont knw how. I dont want people seeing me as a bad person, i dont want to be a bad person.",

I have tried therapy, im pretty aware of why things are tbe way they are but i still cant seem to change myself for the better and keep endin up making the same mistakes over and over again. Ill try to seek more therapy.",

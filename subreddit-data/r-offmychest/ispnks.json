    "postText": "\nSo recently on a night out with some new friends I\u2019ve made one of the girls I\u2019ve got particularly close to was telling me about a guy that\u2019s kind of a stalker to her that they all used to be friends with. She\u2019d told me about the guy before, and a bunch of strange shit he\u2019d done surrounding her and how he\u2019d pester her, but this time she told me that the guy actually raped her at a house party a long time ago, and that having to still deal with his weird obsession to this day scares the shit out of her. I felt awful for her, the hesitant way she kind of went through it all made it obvious that reliving all this was really hard for her.\n\nBut the thing I\u2019ve noticed is that every girl who I\u2019m close enough with for them to trust me with a story like this, will have a story like this. Literally every girl who I\u2019d consider a close friend has told me a similar story; my closest friend was spiked after meeting up with a guy she considers a friend, and he kept trying to make a move on her (he\u2019d never tried this before and knew she was dating her ex at the time) and she highly suspects it was him who spiked her, even though she has no proof. Luckily one of her friends was there to get her home safe and get her away from him. \n\nThe one that stuck with me most came from a girl I got really close with last year. She always seemed kind of intimidating and unapproachable (she\u2019s really one of the kindest and funniest people I\u2019ve met deep down though), but she told me she kind of puts on a tough act to keep people at arms length cause she was raped when she was 14, that it sent her spiralling into waves of depression and anxiety because the dude involved told everyone at school that she fucked him and 3 other guys at the same time to ruin her reputation out of spite, that she had to get psychiatric help cause she was self harming, that she struggles to open up to anyone, and only in the last couple of years has she managed to work through it really. She told me all this with a nonchalant smile on her face, as if it was nothing to her, even though from her voice breaking up I could tell how much it still upset her, and that was sad as fuck to me. In fact, every girl who\u2019s told me a similar story has had that same look, trying to act like it\u2019s no big deal, saying there\u2019s no need to apologise to them cause \u2018it\u2019s in the past now\u2019, that they\u2019re sorry for bringing it up cause there\u2019s no use talking about it, etc.\n\nAnd it\u2019s all just horrifically sad to me, that every girl seems to have some kind of story like this. They all seem broken over it even though they\u2019re braving it out, they all seem resigned to the fact nothing will ever get done about what happened to them, and they all feel like a burden for even mentioning it. And it fucking sucks. I don\u2019t even know what the point of this post is beyond acknowledging how widespread a problem this is; part of me always knew it logically, but as a guy I have that level of privilege where for a long time I was ignorant to the depths of the issue to a level where I could be detached from it emotionally, because it simply wasn\u2019t an issue I had to worry about growing up. I feel stupidly blind that for the longest time I didn\u2019t know quite how many people around me had been directly affected. The more I grow older and the more I encounter these stories firsthand, it really breaks me up inside. But what I have come away with from each of these encounters is a deep sense of utter respect and awe for each of these women, for how strong and brave they\u2019ve had to be, and how much they deal with on their own. I will probably never really understand how it must feel to have to go through that, but I don\u2019t need to understand it to be amazed by every woman who\u2019s dealt with this shit, even when they probably feel their weakest and most vulnerable in opening up about it, all I\u2019ve been able to think about each time is how strong they are.\n\nEDIT: I just want to say thank you to everyone who\u2019s been brave enough to share their own experiences. I didn\u2019t expect me just sharing my thoughts could promote such an open, supportive discussion between people who have actually experienced this, it\u2019s really touching to see. My inbox is pretty packed right now and I need to get some sleep, but I plan on looking through all the replies to this over the next few days when I get the time and replying where I can, I feel like everyone that took the time and courage to share their stories in here deserves to have their voice heard and their experience listened to. Again, thank you for sharing, it\u2019s been massively eye opening reading these.",

I'm a female who was raped twice in my lifetime &amp; a 3rd where someone attempted to sexually assault me but wasn't able to do much because the second he clocked me in the head, another guy saw him on top of me &amp; clocked him in the side of the head. I always thought being \"not very pretty\" would have kept me safe, but it didn't. A lot of it is feeling guilty because the actual 2 rapes that happened were from people i trusted. I feel like it's my fault because I trusted them. I think the most you can do is be there for them &amp; be supportive. You really can't do much more. You can recommend therapy but I\u2019ve chosen to not go to therapy anymore as I told a therapist I was raped &amp; he didn't even acknowledge it. We didn't talk about the rape at all. Instead he just wanted to put me on meds. When he asked me to schedule a session I told him I wouldn't be back. The last rape that happened to me was 2 years ago. I don't remember much, but i remembered I could barely breathe. I remember feeling lucky that I didn't die from strangulation. I feel better knowing my rapists have both moved over 2 hours away from me. But I also notice it has impacted my current relationship. I am sexual with him but not as much as I'd like to be. I get anxious over sex &amp; sometimes i don't feel up for it. I'm attracted to him, I just feel bad I don't have sex with him as much as I wish I would. But he knows what I went through so he always says it's ok but I still feel bad. He never pressures me into anything. I don't know why I'm telling you my whole story, I guess it just feels better to let it out instead of keeping it bottled inside for so many years. I also never reported any of the incidents out of the fear that people would accuse me of lying because you know there are a lot of people out there who claim rape &amp; it's not true.",

Sometimes you hear so many stories about guys complaining saying \"yeah I left my girl because she didn't put out enough\" &amp; that's something I'm terrified of. With my most recent ex, he revolved around sex &amp; I mean masturbated several times a day, followed porn stars on Twitter, &amp; when i was around, he wanted sex daily &amp; there were some times where I felt like i just didn't want it but I also had it in my head that I was \"in love\" &amp; I'd \"do anything for love &amp; to make my man happy\" because if he's not happy then he'll leave so I would just have sex &amp; fake it for him. I think that also took a toll on me. I dated him for 7 years of my life &amp; there was definitely a lot of emotional abuse in that relationship although he was not one of the people who raped me. We got to the point where we moved in together &amp; were looking at houses together; at this point, he was no longer asking for sex or BJs on a daily basis because he started having issues with getting hard so I was in a better place but I still shouldn't have stayed with him for as long as I did. Then one day he just says to me \"I can't stand you. I'm going back home &amp; moving back in with my parents.\"  I had no idea what I did. To this day i still haven't received an answer. That situation just made me think \"what was it? What did I do wrong? I tried to do everything right I thought I was doing. I'm quiet so I don't think I said anything wrong. Was it the sex? Was it because I didn't put out enough or get on my knees &amp; suck his dick more often?\" But you see, that's the way my brain has been conditioned into thinking \"if you don't give it up enough, then you won't be enough for your man to love you &amp; want to stay with you\". &amp; i realize how sad that sounds.\n\nAlso, this post could be reversed where the girl dumps the guy for not putting out enough. By no means am i trying to say \"men are always the abusers\", that is not true. I have a very good friend of mine who is a guy &amp; was raped by a family member as a child. Now he is asexual due to being raped which means he has no interest in sex. Now there's absolutely nothing wrong with that imo. But he also feels like even if he did want to have sex, he couldn't. I know stories of aunts who rape their nephews &amp; such.",

There\u2019s definitely a massive issue with not just sexual abuse, but women feeling like they have to fulfil all kinds of crazy sexual desires to hold a guy\u2019s interest, which is such a troubled way to build a relationship. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve managed to get yourself away from that kind of unhealthy relationship, as clich\u00e9 as it sounds everyone deserves to find someone who values them for who they are rather than just being a sex object. \n\nAnd yeah, I\u2019ve mentioned this elsewhere, but sexual assault against men is something that really needs to be talked about way more. It\u2019s something society still feels a sick right to be able to laugh at and belittle, and I think people are gonna be disgusted when they realise they turned a blind eye to so much horrible shit just because many men felt way too ashamed to admit that anything sinister had happened.",

They can decide what they want to share. And point out that the behaviour of the men they encountered is definitely not OK and does not need to be shrugged off. Speaking for myself, I know it's important to see the difference between \"having had a traumatic experience that I still suffer from\" and \"having had an experience that I know wasn't OK but that I don't suffer from\". I have been groped on many occasions and have been in years worth of toxic relationships, and for me it's just part of life. I don't need pity, as in, really - I'm cool with where I am right now and in a loving relationship. But what I do want is other women to be spared from such experiences. Anyone, really.",

To the point that after I finally got the guy off of me and was bawling he argued that he didn't just force himself on me. I said no so many many times. He kept pushing and eventually I feel silent and just dissociated myself. He felt because during the act that I just layed there and said nothing till I forced him off that I was accepting it. I have fought myself over the guilt that I didn't fight back. My body even betrayed me in how it responded. There are so many mixed emotions. That guy kept asking me to suck him off as I'm crying that he stole my virginity. I was 20 an adult not a kid and I still didn't handle it well. He tried to add me on Facebook and get in contact for a long long time. \n\nSorry, I think I started to ramble a bit. Please please call out your friends out. Male or female.

It hurts to know someone assaulted a loved one and it affects them to this day and you cant do much to help. It also makes you wonder if so many women are experiencing this then there is an equally large amount of men perpetrating sexual assault. It's a massive problem but one that, at this moment, seems unsolvable. I rlly hope that changes. I think we need harsher punishments to act as a deterrant.",

Men try convince teenagers that they are mature for their age. Not all men do this, but the men that do are relentless. They dont stop, and they do it with as many girls as they can find in the Hope's that they find one who is gullible, naive, actually interested.\n\nThe only thing we can do is be the kind of man who is trustworthy. The only thing we can do as men, among men is call each other out on this shit. to condemn this behavior.

I guess they don\u2019t want to be viewed perpetually as victims and just to be treated normally.

None of them had ever gone to the police or any authority. One of these rapes resulted in pregnancy and she had to eventually tell her parents so that they could take her to get an abortion (she was a kid).\n\nI'm currently struggling to deal with my sister in law having been sexually assaulted in her sleep by my ex boyfriend. It's brought up all my stuff again too - of course I didn't say this to her as she'd feel bad for upsetting me. \n\nThe more we talk about the less people will feel they can get away with it, I hope.",

The fact that after all this you\u2019ve found it in yourself to be there for her is genuinely amazing.\n\nI\u2019ve said this elsewhere in this thread, but I believe you\u2019re right; society\u2019s finally shedding some kind of light on all this, and I think we\u2019re kind of reaching a tipping point where we can\u2019t just turn a blind eye to it anymore.

I'm not sure what she plans to do with that information, I don't know if she'll still marry him, but I thought she was entitled to know before she made that decision. I would have reported it to police if my family hadn't been so opposed to it; now, as an adult, I know it isn't worth going through the process because it's highly unlikely I'd ever see justice in my case.\n\nIt's so widespread. In my group of close friends (7 women), only one friend has never been sexually assaulted. Most of them were victimized by someone they knew - a brother, an uncle, an romantic partner. It's disgusting. \n\nAnd none of us have ever been supported. We all had to work through the effects on our own. Looking back, I had PTSD for much of highschool and part of university - I'd have nightmares and flashbacks where I'd relive what happened. My boyfriend knew he couldn't touch me in a certain way otherwise I'd forget it was him and I'd fight. It took me a solid decade to start putting the pieces back together so I could begin the process of healing.\n\nI sincerely hope you're right and we see real changes - but I'll admit I don't have a lot of hope. I would love to be wrong about this though.",

Every single one of us had a shitty cop story of being violated. I realized all girls have a shitty guy story of being violated.\n\nI know how fucked up and angry that has made me feel as a guy, going through that, knowing society at large does not believe us when we talk about how fucked up cops are, and had to realize that damn, women go through a lot of the same shit. I had to think about ways I may have even contributed without even thinking about it. And this is the key part. Me thinking about that made me wonder about fucked up cops and if THEY question why they do as well. \n\nIt made me then think even more about conditioning. How much we are all conditioned to play our role in society in a certain way and we rarely question it when we are on the side of the powerful. But when we are on the side of the oppressed, we can't do anything BUT think about it. \n\nShit is fucked up. I don't know what the answer is.",

As a woman who gets regularly groped, touched without consent, and has been sexual assaulted, it was a real eye opening moment for me. My body is not my own, men think they have a right to it, much like your experiences with police or white people. And years later that chapter has really stuck with me. \n\nAnd it made me honestly so fucking angry.

Many men and women don\u2019t even realize that some behaviors and actions are abusive and are the warm-ups to rape.\n\nI had a boyfriend in High School that was very popular with people. But a few months into dating he started abusing me and raped me. I went to a school councilor and was discouraged from reporting him to the authorities. (That was not great and reinforced that I needed to stay silent) When I finally was able to break up with him he found a way to punish me. I was called to come pick him up from a party because he was too drunk and everyone else at the party was too drunk as well. And the people calling basically threatened to keep calling until my parents heard and I just got scared. So I went to get him and when I got to the party I went to the upstairs bathroom where he was supposed to be. Instead of finding him too sick and drunk, I was tackled by him and several of his friends who all took turns raping me as I screamed for help. It was horrible. Finally someone else heard my screams and ripped the guys off me and followed me home to make sure I was safe.\n\nAnd after as an adult I got married and quickly into my marriage I discovered that my husband was abusive and would sexually assault me regularly. \n\nOnce someone has been a survivor of sexual assault, many abusers will key in on certain traits that those survivors incorporate into their life after their attacks. It can leave survivors to a higher chance of being targeted again because certain abusers will use survivors past traumas time gaslight them.\n\nThe fact that you have cultivated a space for your friends to share their stories says a lot about you. But it also gives your friends a special amount of dignity and power back. Because you are bearing witness to their truth and their lives. That is a beautiful and incredible gift.\n\nThank you.\n\n\nEdited to add: I divorced my ex husband years ago after too many years of marriage. But I am doing well now and happily engaged to a wonderful person.",

And I started realizing that it wasn't as uncommon as I thought (and wished) it was. \nTrauma is a crazy thing. It changes your brain. I, sadly, agree that in some instances if you have been assaulted/abused before, it can set you up for repeat offenses. Traits you pick up, or something, I'm not sure. Which is frustrating and terrifying. Each time you think, \"this can't be happening again\". You pull mental gymnastics trying to explain things away because it feels safer and easier to say it's something you're doing wrong, because at least you can try to change yourself.

While I appreciate spreading the message to other men who seem to have turned a blind eye to this I think it almost perpetuates a standard that guys aren\u2019t expected to know this and that being aware of it is such a groundbreaking thing",

We teach girls from a young age how big of an issue this is, to never walk alone at night, drill it into their heads that this is a massive issue, that is if they haven\u2019t already had to experience it. Guys never get educated on how massive this issue is for girls, they\u2019re never taught consent or expected to understand it in full, because society wants to keep it swept aside, and so we get the privilege of just wandering along in life not realising the severity of what\u2019s going on around us. Sure, we hear about some awful attack on the news, we hear some girl\u2019s had to take time off school because of some \u2018drama\u2019 with a guy, but it never clicks for so many people who deep this goes. \n\nAnd I\u2019m so sorry about that. It shouldn\u2019t be this way. We should be holding our young boys and men up to a far higher standard and educating them on what goes on. This shit is not okay, and it shouldn\u2019t have to take so much trauma for the cries for help to even break through the threshold and for people to start even listening, never mind taking action. It\u2019s not been enough, and in so many ways we\u2019ve failed the women who have had to grow up in constant fear of this bullshit. It\u2019s never been okay.",

I still have it somewhere) and tried to assault me once while I was mostly asleep. I had largely blocked it out. Sadly I have had much \"worse\" things happen before and after that and ot was just something I put away.\n\nThis motherfucker made this big long post detailing his actions (including a bit of a pity party about how he injured himself out of anger and jealousy/entitlement afterward), or a version of it. Of course he omitted all the creepy shit he did after that no matter how I tried to distance from him.\nBut yeah, he got all this praise for coming forward and 6 million woke points and shit for being so \"brave\" and assured he was a wonderful person anyway and all this. I wanted to vomit. Not because he admitted to it but because he basically fucking used it for clout in some twisted way and got PRAISE for it! Oh, and for stopping himself and not \"going through with it\". Because sexual assault is cool as long as you stop shy of actual rape. \n\nAnyway, what really pissed me off was that he put that shit out there to the whole general public and his regret for \"all women\" for a goddamn cookie and guess who never actually got a fucking apology. Sonofabitch never had the balls to say one thing to me directly/personally/privately. \n\nIt just felt so gross and like a violation all over again. \n\nHe got loads of praise for beingnsuch a good guy and I didn't even get an apology.

I\u2019ve been assaulted/harassed, but I\u2019m thankful I haven\u2019t been raped. I shouldn\u2019t feel thankful for that. assault and harassment shouldn\u2019t be so normalized that I feel grateful it wasn\u2019t something worse. I can\u2019t think about this all too much because it\u2019s just so devastating. \n\nI thank you for being willing to listen to our stories and believe us and for recognizing your privilege. I hope that you\u2019ll use this to help protect any woman who might be in trouble and to call out anybody you see being predatory.\n\nThere are so many women who have been assaulted/harassed, but nobody seems to know any guys who would do that. I\u2019m not trying to say that all men assault women or that men never get harassed/assaulted, but almost every woman has a story and a lot of them have a guy on the other end. \n\nPlease just truly listen to what your friends are saying. Pay attention to how they talk about/treat women. Please try to call them out if you see/hear anything problematic. Women can\u2019t stop this problem on our own, everyone has to work together",

If I can make a suggestion, check out I May Destroy You on HBO.

I\u2019m so fucking ashamed of that and 14 years later I still can\u2019t stand that that was the perception I was raised with.

I don't believe that most abusers are even interested sexually in children. Pedophilia is very rare condition. It doesn't explain why there is so much abuse going on. Every abuser just can't be a pedophile. There is probably even something worse happening. Many people have violence in them and kids are easiest targets. And sexual violence is often worst a person can do. But violence can also be something a person just can't control. It can be like possession. It's why some say \"I don't know what got into me\".\n\nThese things should be brought to light. But there are so many (most of them men) who do all they can to keep things hidden.",

(Not saying that's your fault, OP. Just my reaction to this slice of our shared reality.) \n\nBut seriously, believe that it's an issue, y'all. Don't even wait for almost all the women in your life to personally confirm it like OP did before feeling like it might actually be true. As OP said, it looked painful for their friend to share that part of their story. It shouldn't be necessary for every man to be on the receiving end of that personal vulnerability from so many people in their lives to believe that this violence happens. So much information is already available outside of that context.",

People say I'm lying and that the world isn't really as scary as I say it is.  I mostly don't talk about it anymore because I don't want to deal with people being dismissive and condescending.\n\nIt's awesome that you can be a friend to these women and treat them with enough respect and kindness that they are willing to open up to you like this.",

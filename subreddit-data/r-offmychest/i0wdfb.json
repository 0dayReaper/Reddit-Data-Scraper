I feel like such a part of a reddit family now haha keep on being your badass women AND men! \n\nEdit: holy shit I\u2019ve never had a post do this well thank you all for the support \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit 2: omg 1.4k upvotes and awards! I feel so HEARD by you all thank you!!\n\nEdit 3: hi everyone I just woke up to a post that blew the heck up! I\u2019m reading through all your comments but if I don\u2019t get to answer youre still awesome!\n\nI don\u2019t want kids. I\u2019m 99.99% sure of this. But I\u2019ll leave that .01% for the chance that I fall in love with the perfect man and magically change my mind. We as women don\u2019t OWE anyone an explanation, but I\u2019ve completed a list of every reason I do not want children, hopefully I don\u2019t forget any. \n\n-I do NOT have a maternal bone in my body. Screaming children make me homicidal. Kids having a tantrum make me want to drop kick them, not coddle them. \n\n-I don\u2019t want to be pregnant.\n\n-I don\u2019t want to experience morning sickness (not everyone gets it, but I have no desire to test that theory)\n\n-I don\u2019t want to give up alcohol for 9 months \n\n-I don\u2019t want to go through labor\n\n-I don\u2019t want to gain weight and get more stretch marks \n\n-I don\u2019t want to give birth, I don\u2019t want to tear, I don\u2019t want to poop on the table \n\n-I don\u2019t want to deal with the vaginal recovery of birth. You don\u2019t just snap back to normal, you bleed and look fucked up for weeks\n\n-I don\u2019t want to have to not have sex while recovering and have to deal with a \u201chusband who has needs\u201d. I just pushed a fucking baby out of my vagina go get a fleshlight. \n\n-many husbands cheat on their pregnant spouses. I don\u2019t want to be cheated on in general, but the pain seems worse when you\u2019re carrying someone\u2019s child and have to still give birth to and raise that child \n\n-I don\u2019t want to deal with sleepless nights. \n\n-I don\u2019t want to fight with my spouse over who has to get up to take care of a middle of the night screaming baby \n\n-I don\u2019t want a relationship to suffer because I feel like I\u2019m doing a majority of the caretaking when it is BOTH of our child  \n\n-I don\u2019t want to clean explosive diarrhea diapers\n\n-I don\u2019t want to deal with every fucking stomach bug kids bring home from school each year \n\n-I don\u2019t want to spend my hard earned money on anything other than myself or those I choose to spend it on. NOT on someone I HAVE to spend it on \n\n-I don\u2019t want to deal with tantrums in public OR at home \n\n-I don\u2019t want to do any of it. I don\u2019t want to sacrifice my life to raise a baby. I just dont. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot more I forgot about. I see the value in having a family. I would date someone with a child from a previous relationship. But I have no desire to grow and birth a child or raise one. \n\nPeople feel all of these things. And to question anyone on why they don\u2019t want kids is just rude. Think about all these points. They\u2019re valid. No woman should HAVE to deal with ANY of these things if she doesn\u2019t want to. PERIOD.",

Ive mentioned this to a guy who was complain about their kids waking them up at night and interfering with their free time. They immediately started telling me how much I would enjoy it.\n\nA woman I work with mentioned how she accidentally had children and has decided that if she is not married in 5 years at age 40 she will begin to live \"her best life\" since she hasnt done much since having kids. Of course she did the same as the previous guy.\n\nMy favorite excuse though is when people mention that once I get all my traveling and fun out the way I will be ready.",

I asked her what was selfish, having a kid I knew I didn't want and would resent for the rest of their life or knowing I don't want kids and deciding to not have them? She came around after thinking on that for a bit. She is a mom and she like other moms assumes having a baby is a universal want/need. She also assumed I would change my mind once I felt I was content with life. It has been 6 years since that conversation and I am fully content with my life, the only differences for me now from then is my age and job.

They're more common than people think; I had two before my oldest, and when I got pregnant with my oldest the doctor's office just nonchalantly referred to it as my \"third pregnancy\" ... or my \"fourth pregnancy\" with my second son.  By that time I was mostly past the hurt, but it still stings.\n\nI announced it with my oldest and despised the unsolicited advice and bump touching.  I did not announce my second and it was awesome seeing people squirm cause that knew it wasn't polite to ask. \n\nAlso, I just want to add that, breastfeeding is overrated :p",

However, as I grow up and began living my life, I see just how screwed up the world is. \n\nI have medical issues that I would hate to give to a child (and I doubt I\u2019ll actually be able to get pregnant if I ever wanted to). I get anxiety thinking about the possibility of bringing another child into this world and I\u2019m not sure I could handle my flesh and blood turning into someone I don\u2019t like. Or getting bullied and committing suicide, or getting cancer and is sick their whole childhood. \n\nI dunno, but the thought of bringing someone else into this world with all the unknown scares me to death. \n\nI\u2019m almost 26 and just got preapproved to buy my first home. I took a long ways for schooling and have a year and a half before I\u2019m done with my bachelors. I\u2019m single and have never been in a relationship. I\u2019m happy with my life and my cats (and a dog once I have a yard of my own!) and am looking forward to my career. I want to travel and see quite a bit of the world. \n\nHowever, I feel like if I hit a certain age (maybe 32-35 years old) and I\u2019m still alone, I\u2019m solid in my career and financially stable, and I\u2019ve done some traveling.... there is a good possibility that I would consider fostering to adopt an older child. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s selfish of me, but I don\u2019t want to be alone forever. If I have a safe and comfortable home to give to a child so they don\u2019t have to be alone forever, and I don\u2019t have to be, than why not? \n\nI feel like I have maternal instincts, and really did grow up wanting to be a mom. I think the reality of life sets in though, and for me to birth a child doesn\u2019t sound appealing (I\u2019m with OP on this) or capable.

And if we do eventually want children there are plenty of children in the system that need a good home. \n\nI have autoimmune issues I really don't want to contribute to those by getting pregnant, I might change my mind most likely considering I'm 35 years old and my clock hasn't started ticking probably not, but that doesn't mean I don't have the option later to foster or adopt.\n\nBut I have to constantly remind my parents especially that while I understand they want grandchildren, with my autoimmune issues there are some days that putting my shoes on is really challenging, I don't get that option once I have a baby of just not doing something that day.\n\nYou don't get to tell a baby that Mommy's feeling bad and they need to go eat on their own.\n\nSo it really frustrates me to get told endlessly that I need to have a baby.\n\nNO! I DON'T!",

Better to not have kids than feel forced into it and hate the kid. Kids are smart and sense that shit and it fucks them up. You do you and just enjoy your life!\ud83d\ude0a",

I can\u2019t imagine the guilt I\u2019d have if something happened to them. People always get upset when I say this, but I know for sure that I do not want to bring a child into this fucked up world.\n\nI didn\u2019t ask to be here. Obviously, I\u2019ll make the best of it, but idk. I just don\u2019t want to be responsible for another human being.",

I do find them cute sometimes but I don't have the patience to deal with them. And I absolutely hate the screaming and the constant jumping down. \n\nMy mom tells us I'm selfish and ngl this has been bothering me for a while",

KUDO'S to you girl!!  If YOUR not happy there's a really good chance your kids would suffer for it. Your entitled to be HAPPY tondo your own thing,  to not rent your body for 9 months And to not have kids if u do t want to!  That's what nieces, nephews and best friends kids are for!!",

Just make sure you're financially stable first \n\nIf you don't, that's fine! You're buying first round lol \n\nAs for the cheating part and aftermath of pregnancy, as a male, I find it low.. a woman is bearing my child, my own flesh and blood and to go out and shag another woman? I'd sooner chop off my dick with a rusty blunt knife than stick in somewhere else \n\nLive your life how you want to live it not how anyone else wants you to live it and do what you want, maybe you'll meet that perfect guy and you change your mind or maybe that perfect guy thinks like you and also doesn't want kids either way, it's your life at the end of the day, don't let anyone tell you otherwise",

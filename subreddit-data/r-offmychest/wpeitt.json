I wasn\u2019t even able to get my door unlocked before he attacked me and I shit myself on purpose as he tried to unlock my door with my keys while they were still in my hand. I shit myself with the force of a thousand pistons and let it run down my legs. No sane man would attack another person but I think it takes an even crazier man to rape someone covered in shit. Lucky for me he wasn\u2019t that sort of crazy. I never thought it\u2019d be so rewarding to shit myself as an adult but here I am 4 hours later, showered and safe.",

Don\u2019t be embarrassed to make a scene. Make a fucking scene. Make the biggest scene you have ever made in your entire life. Be as disgusting and crazy and unhinged as you can. Scream, screech, whisper and talk to yourself, shit yourself and smear the shit everywhere/throw it at your attacker, puke, piss, rip out your own hair, claw at your face and the air, jump and flail around, throw yourself on the ground. Twitch and convulse. Crab walk like you are possessed. Bare your teeth and literally growl like a feral animal.\n\nSomeone following you? Turn around. Stand completely still while you stare at them with your eyes AS WIDE AS THEY CAN GO. Turn your head slowly to the side until it\u2019s almost touching your shoulder, and grin as WIDE AS YOU CAN. Say \u201cI SEEEEE YOUUUUUUUUUU\u201d and laugh manically. \n\nAct like you are the creepy terrifying monster in a horror movie, combined with the craziest version of yourself that you can muster.

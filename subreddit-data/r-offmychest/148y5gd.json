    "postText": "My friend is going out of town and I will be dog sitting her dog. I\u2019m not charging her. We had previously discussed that I would stay at her place to dog sit Thursday and Sunday night only. Friday and Saturday night her dog would come with me at my place. My relative last minute who lives with me had to travel due to a family emergency so I won\u2019t have anyone to watch my pets except I do have someone Sunday night so I will be going to her place by then.   She sends me a message stating \u201cwe just talked about dog\u2019s name being at her house on Thursday and Sunday night\u201d. \u201cBut it\u2019s fine\u201d.   I texted back \u201che will be on Thursday except at night.\u201d  She said \u201c I understand that. But that\u2019s not what we talked about\u201d.   I told her \u201c I don\u2019t have a choice\u201d.   She replied back with \u201cI know\u201d.   I know with text messages you truly don\u2019t know how someone is talking to you. Perhaps I took it as someone who isn\u2019t appreciative. :(",

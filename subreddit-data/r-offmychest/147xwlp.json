    "postText": "I (22m) met me fianc\u00e9 (21f) about 2 years ago at a church group we both went too. When I had first met her, I had immediately thought, \u201cThis is the most beautiful girl in the world, there is no way she is single/would even wanna touch me with a two foot pole.\u201d Well, I was wrong, obviously, and she invited me on our first date. \n\nNow before this, when I was 16 I dated another girl who constantly talked down on me and beat the crap out of me. When she finally broke up with me, to tell the truth, I was heartbroken. I learned to understand that this was a blessing, but I kinda had it in my mind and told everyone that I didn\u2019t want to date again and I can never trust another woman to not make me feel like crap all the time. \n\nThen, as so many stories happen now a days, 2020 happened. I loved it, for about 2 months , I got to go to work then come home and play video games, but it wore off. I never talked to anyone. So I started a podcast in about the people that live in my hometown, it really broke me out of my shell and got me to where I\u2019m at now of being able to talk to a lot of people and get to know and care for people as I came across them. Then I met my fianc\u00e9.\n\nShe made me want to be an even better person then I ever thought I could. Truthfully, everyday is a blessing because I know I will eventually end up saying goodnight to her and holding her every night. \n\nI have other people that I could share my happiness with, but I feel like they would think I would be bragging, which I don\u2019t want to do.",

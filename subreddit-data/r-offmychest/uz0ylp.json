    "postText": "So I am now a 28 year old woman with a two year old daughter that I love more than life itself.\n\nMy father died yesterday. He had testicular cancer that abscised to his brain. It went rather quickly.\n\nWhen I was 10 my stepfather abused me, physically, sexually. Any way you can imagine. My mother turned her head and when I told her slapped me and told me I was lying. My stepfather disappeared one night.\n\nThis is small town Indiana. Roughly a 2000 population town. He went out to the bar and never came back. He was missing and he was never found until about 5 years later his remains were found in the local quarry. \n\nMy dad told me yesterday that he did it. I asked him what happened to my stepdad and he said \u201cthere was no other way\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m at peace with this I think. Looking at my 2 year old now and thinking of what my mother did is unimaginable. I just need to let this out and move on.",

I know recidivism is huge with pedophiles, but this is talking about convicted pedophiles who've committed this awful crime, they often can't stop. But what about those who seek out therapy for prevention, which is difficult due to stigma, I wonder if there's been studies. It's worth thinking about because most pedophiles are victims of SA themselves, which we can have sympathy for right up until they act on it.",

A lot admit and seek treatment for the uncontrolled desires because they're aware that it's wrong.\n\nThose that follow through with a crime without remorse deserve to be punished to the full extent but the word pedophilia conjures ideas that they're people who have commited the heinous act. It's a natural bias we all have, we cringe, are disgusted and angry but it's actually just a blanket term.\n\nI feel uncomfortable even saying it but I think it has to be understood that it doesn't always mean an offender. \n\nEven now my automatic reaction to this is to go wash my hands.",

Our legal system really fails victims of sexual abuse/violence. Killing the perpetrator was extreme, but he clearly believed that was the only way to keep her safe. And I hope it brings OP comfort that her dad loved her so much that he would have gone to jail for murder because it meant that piece of flaming shit would never touch his child again. As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse myself, I can't say that her dad should have murdered the dude, but I can sleep a little better tonight knowing that the bastard (stepdad) is dead.\n\nOP, I cannot imagine the pain you are in, but my sincerest condolences.

They fucking put those guys in luxury cells closed off from other prisoners so that they won\u2019t get hurt. They\u2019ll get out in 10 years tops before going Scott free. There\u2019s no real option, there\u2019s no such thing as rehabilitation for a sexual abuser, they aren\u2019t mentally Ill, they\u2019re evil, you can\u2019t accidentally sexual abuse a child on the constant. He\u2019s evil and he received true justice.",

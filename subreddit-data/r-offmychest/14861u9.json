    "postText": "I (23 transM) and my ex B (20nb) dated a little over 2 years ago. Our relationship wasn't great, and not in an abusive way, more of just constant communication issues and us ALWAYS butting heads on different topics. It wasn't a super long relationship but I grew really attached to them so I took the breakup really hard, especially because of some words exchanged towards the end, and we ended up cutting all contact, with them going as far as to block me. It hurt but I moved on. \n\nFast forward to a week ago, I saw they added me on TT. Honestly, I was a little shocked and expected them to realize they made a mistake and go to block me. However, when I went to request to follow back a day later(they have a private account), they immediately accepted. Today they even dmed me and at first it almost felt like they'd reached out to tell me they missed me or something, but then they hit me with the news that they had been dating a new guy for 2 years now and planned on moving in with him. \n\nI didn't expect my heart to hurt and I know they're not obligated by any means to like me after all this time, but the news still stung me. I congratulated them though and I made sure to respond quickly and enthusiastically so my sadness wouldnt seep through, but the fact I even got so sad shows I'm not over them yet and can't talk to them. They deserve a great life with the new guy and I just can't ruin that for them. Hurts but I'll live.",

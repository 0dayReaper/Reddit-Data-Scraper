    "postText": "Cheers to the next 45\n\nPart 1. (I hope this goes well)\n\nHi there, thank you in advance to all who will take  the time to read this post. \n\nI am a 44 year woman, currently living in Northeastern PA or as I like to say sometimes \u201cthe armpit of America\u201d \nI am a transplant from Queens NY. \nI am still dealing with the cultural shock between here and there.  \nI can\u2019t believe 31 years have gone by, I could barf \ud83e\udd2e \n\nI am a daughter, a sister, mother and an aunt. I have a fantastic group of friends whom most have become family.  I should mention that I am also legally someone\u2019s wife and I have a boyfriend I live with.  Long story \ud83d\ude02\n\nAt the current time I am responsible for my cat  he is 13 and a 6 year old beagle that I acquired about a year ago.  And I cannot get that friendship to flourish no matter what I do, or say or feed them\u2026.the dang dog and cat hate each and there\u2019s not much I can do. \n\nI love happy hour and fundraisers with my girlfriends. We have lots of fun and for the most part we are all liked among the people around us except for me, I am always always  always at odds with someone. Literally always!!!!\nIt takes such a toll on me emotionally and physically it\u2019s so draining. \nAlways a family member for sure, next a close friend and it usually the same friend for the passed 27 years\u2026.lmao she\u2019s a pisser!! And lastly the acquaintances.  It\u2019s ridiculous actually and I need this change!!\nMy other problems are\nI almost never say no to drugs.  I don\u2019t take any prescription meds mine or anyone else\u2019s, I like illicit drugs \ud83e\udd23 \nI need to see my primary doctor but \nI don\u2019t have health insurance with work. I am not full time  and  based on income level I am not eligible for the state insurance.  I need a check up for sure. Believe me I could work 40 hours a week and I should be working close to it by now and possibly I am already working my way to that. it\u2019s just I am slow to get there. Baby steps with me. I have a reputation for not taking work seriously because of my old behaviors  and believe me when I say I have come along way from calling off drunk or no showing.  Lie to boss about whatever in order to stay home. One job in particular kept old 2 voice messages from 10 years ago it was devastating to hear them crap  I was so embarrassed.  It\u2019s a bad reputation to have. \nIt took 20 years to get the job I have now thanks to a good friend, old drinking buddy, so I only give what I can. 8:30-3:30 5 days a week.\nI am Happy to report\nNo major addictions at the time! Rehab once in 94 or 95 \nI was 14 or 15 and mental illness hospital for teens in 93.  I moved to armpit Pennsylvania full time  in 91/92. \nI have been known to go overboard and get a little careless so I try not too go hard often. \nI also hate how long my body takes to recover.  The other problem is looking at your phone the next day and seeing what a mess I caused.  Sometimes the stories discussed with friends are funny. Then the guilt comes for spending my money where it doesn\u2019t belong. It\u2019s one of my biggest struggles. I hope I can get that together sooner than later. \n\nThe original thought for this post was to vent to you about being treated badly by the people in the Jessica haters club but since I began writing its become more like a personal roast to myself and maybe if I keep writing something cool will happen. \n\nI love live music\u2026.I was born listening to the Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan, Allman Brothers, and The Band to name a few.  I love the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s as well.  Concerts are my favorite pastime and dating a musician has always been something I wanted. \n\nMy love for music came \nfrom my mother.  Although my dad has a pretty good eye for the tunes too\u2026\u2026She and I would sing anywhere and everywhere all the time. We took the bus everywhere in New York and every walk to and from bus stop we sang.  It\u2019s a good memory to have and reference because there aren\u2019t that many good memories to share.  \n\nSome of my most vivid memories \nWith my mom involve something verbal, physical, emotional and mentally exhausting to me.  \nTough love is what I have been told by friends or relatives. \nMy mom and dad split when I was in kindergarten and he would be in and out of my life until  3rd grade. \nMy parents hatred for each other did not go unnoticed .  She would always use me as a pawn, spewing venom constantly. She was wasted a-lot so I had to be her nurse on hangover days.  She was incredibly pretty and had lots of men callers at night. Parties galore and countless other people in and out of our lives. She would take me with her sometimes to concerts and friends houses or just to the bar to hang. I was always the only kid around. \nMy clothes never fit either to big or too small. My shoes were never the right size.  I never got to keep my toys for long because they would end up thrown away due to my behavior or because we had to move again and our belongings were moved out to the street..that was on more than one occasion. In 10 years we lived in over 20 spots and had just as many telephone numbers.  A different school for every grade up til 4th. \nI definitely never got settled into anywhere.  That could explain a-lot come to think about it.  Wow \ud83d\ude2e \nObviously I have no idea how my mom was feeling or what would be going through her mind when these sorts of things were happening to us. Before she got sick I asked some questions on a few occasions but she\u2019d somehow get me to shut down and stop wasting my breath.  I even went no contact with her. For 2 years \nI just wonder if it occurred to her that she was neglecting me and creating the great dysfunction I am today.  \nI want to heal, this post is part of a bigger effort on my behalf. I need to heal and let go of 45 years of pain and suffering and get ready for the next 45.\nIs that even possible?\n\nTo be continued\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..",

    "postText": "I have a boyfriend and I love him so damn much. Every single aspect of him, his face, his personality, his body, his hair, his little quirks as all. I have been questioning my gender identity for over 10 years now, and I have been trying to push the fact that I\u2019m a man out of my head. I know he\u2019s straight but I have been in the closet for too long and I\u2019m ready to come out. I\u2019m just too scared bc I know he won\u2019t be attracted to me anymore. I know he\u2019s attracted to her, the person I used to be, but not me. I need advice\u2026",

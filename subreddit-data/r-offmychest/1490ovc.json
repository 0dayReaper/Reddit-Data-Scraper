    "postText": "tw: suicide, alcohol, mentions of abuse. \n\nhonestly, i\u2019m so exhausted. i work all day, come home to my partner and his verbally/emotionally/financially abusive family. my partner says he loves me but i feel like i\u2019m just with him to provide for him in every sense of the word. i\u2019m in a place several states and thousands of miles away from any of my family or friends, and have no way to even get myself back to my family if i wanted to. i\u2019m  in debt, broke all the time, and often have to choose between making rent or buying gas and groceries. my partner works but does not make much. \n\nwhile i do enjoy my job, it is very emotionally taxing and i\u2019m honestly just tired. i\u2019m so incredibly lonely and burnt out and depressed. i have bipolar type 1, bpd, and generalized anxiety disorder, which i was previously medicated for but i can\u2019t even afford my medication anymore since i have no insurance and had to stop taking it cold turkey. i have fibromyalgia and chronic migraines and pcos. basically i\u2019m a walking mess. everything hurts, all the time.\n\nand then there\u2019s the fact that the world is on fire and chaotic and uncertain. i really think that things are only going to get worse. i don\u2019t see any reasonable change being made. \n\ni have no desire to even be awake. i feel so empty, all the time. nothing interests or excites me. i\u2019ve been binge drinking until i black out to numb the pain. \n\ni\u2019m only in contact with my parents at this point. i really only remain alive for them. i don\u2019t want to hurt them by making them lose their first child, their only daughter. i love them and i miss them. i\u2019ve decided that when they both pass away i will end my life. they are the only people who have ever made me feel loved and protected and whole. the idea of having to continue this miserable existence without them in my life is just so soul crushing and scary. \n\ni want this life to end. i\u2019m so tired of suffering through my days. i\u2019m just holding on until my family is gone. but i can\u2019t wait until the day i can end all this nonsense.",

    "postText": "Maybe because I kinda took the cheaper route, well the free NHS route, I was on the waiting list for 18 months, and it\u2019s finally here. She said it\u2019ll probably take 6 sessions which felt short. And we are 4 sessions in.\n\nEach week she asks me questions I\u2019ll answer on a 1-5 scale (not al all vs almost everyday type thing) she will ask me to tell her what problems I\u2019ve had this week and kinda go \u201coh well look at them like this. I\u2019ll send you a worksheet. Read it Bye I\u2019ll call ya next week\u201d \n\nI\u2019ll read the booklets which are just patronising shit. I\u2019ll tell her \u201cI had a moment this week and had a flashback to when I was a kid and was getting the shit beat out of me by my mother and how I felt after that was how I felt yesterday after something minor\u201d and she\u2019s like like \u201coh well, shall we look at your social anxiety\u201d like no, hun, look at my trauma. I can\u2019t even look my long term partner in the eye, I feel embarrassed walking into a shop or crossing the street because I am so scared of attention, so much so I don\u2019t enjoy sexual contact or even cuddling or doing actives with people, I go to concerts alone because I\u2019m too embarrassed to enjoy myself around people. I\u2019m also deathly afraid of upsetting people even slightly, that\u2019s why I stuck at a job where I was getting bullied for 5 years too long, so I\u2019m too scared to tell her this doesn\u2019t seems like a right fit. Like who am I to know? I don\u2019t know this is the first time I\u2019ve done therapy. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to say, is it me? Am I not putting my problems across well enough? I\u2019ve never spoke about this out loud before and it\u2019s scary. I write down my thoughts thought the week but I don\u2019t think she really wants to hear it, it\u2019s like she\u2019s reading a script. Like she asked me what I would think if I seen a friend in the street and I waved and they didn\u2019t wave back, how would I feel, and I said \u201cI\u2019d not wave I would have ran into the nearest shop until they passed, even if it was a family member, so I didn\u2019t need to talk to anybody\u201d and she\u2019s like \u201coh, well, errr, just imagine you did then\u201d. No, I can\u2019t, I would never do that.",

            "comment": "Unfortunately, finding a therapist isn't a \"one size fits all\" type of deal. Therapy really works when you have a therapist you connect with. To me, it sounds like you and your therapist just aren't very compatible. It might be time to look into better options.\n\nFor me, I looked on Psychology Today for my current therapist. You're able to filter things like your insurance plan (if you have one), your focuses (things like if you struggle with a certain type of mental illness or trauma, again, if you have one), telehealth or in person, and you can even filter LGBTQ friendly therapists, as well if you have a gender preference for your therapists. There are also similar sites like it as well, but that one worked for me.\n\nI really connect with my therapist a ton, and I look forward to meeting with her every week. That's how therapy should be! If your therapist is handing you a pamphlet and not listening to your problems or if therapy is starting to seem like a chore, it's definitely time to look for a new one. The quest is arduous but absolutely worth it. Hope this helps!",

Some also have sliding scales as well so if money is an issue, you still will have to pay some but not something crazy. My therapist is in training, and I pay $30 a session! Unfortunately I've found with free therapy programs that the therapy itself is mediocre at best.",

    "postText": "My partner and I have been engaged for about a year. The last year has been impossibly hard/ We moved 400 miles away so I could go to veterinary school in August. In September, his mom's health started declining. In 2017 she was diagnosed with endometrial cancer, and the odds didn't look good. She responded well to treatment and was doing really well for several years. But in the fall they found it had spread to her lymph nodes and bone, and the treatment was really hard this time around. She was bedridden and needed a caregiver full-time. My partner and his brother decided to both move back home for a while and help out. Which turned into just my partner helping out while his brother avoided the situation. I had to stay where we live for school. It felt impossible.\n\nOver the holidays, my MIL's sister came and stayed with her so my partner could be at home with me for a little while. In January, they called and let us know that her situation was rapidly declining, and that we should come and be with her. I spoke with the dean of my program about taking time off, and we were there the next day. We got another week with her before she passed.\n\nAfter my partner and I got engaged, we kept planning tentative dates for the wedding, but kept postponing because of the whole situation. We didn't want to be engaged for a long time, and were just looking at dates when I had breaks from school. There's been a lot of aftermath to sort through with MIL's house, and everything in it, and trying to work things out with BIL (which has been kind of a shit show).\n\nWe finally decided on a date this summer after the exams I need to make up. It's going to be small. We were planning on my parents and brother, his dad and stepmom, maybe his brother, and one or two very close friends. My brother just doesn't want to come. At this point we're not sure if we want his brother to come because of the way he's been acting regarding MIL's house and possessions. And now we found out that his dad and step mom are going to be in Europe. They take a trip to Europe where FIL/MIL are from every year and usually stay a month or two. This year, they're going to be gone from mid-June until the end of September. So now we're down to three, maybe four other people coming, and none of them are partner's family.\n\nIt makes me so sad. I feel like he's lost so much this year, and I don't want this to be a lonely day for him. I want to get married sooner rather than later, but my heart is breaking for my partner. If we put it off again, we'll probably have to wait until next summer, and we've already hired an officiant and photographer and some other stuff. \n\nI just don't know what to do. Partner is asking his dad if they'll consider making a trip back to the US for the wedding, and we'd be more than happy to pay for their travel costs. But he feels terrible even asking. And I'm just anxious because I don't know whether to tell my parents to make plans or not. It's weird not knowing if you're going to have your wedding in a month or a year. I just wish I knew either way so I could cry about it and let everyone else know what's going on. \n\ntl;dr: My partner's mom passed away this year and now his dad might not come to our already very small wedding. And it breaks my heart to imagine that. ",

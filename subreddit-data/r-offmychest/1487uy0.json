    "postText": "Context: I am a Volunteer firefighter for my hometown. We are an ISO class 3 dept with a soft 50 or so members not including the college student firefighters. I myself am an upper classman in highschool and have been with the department for about 2.5 years. This kid in my class wants to join. But the problem is, is thag he\u2019s popular but nobody likes him because he uses his parent\u2019s benefits to gain in life (his mom was AD and tried to get coaches to make him start in sports), he made sports seasons miserable and he is just an asshole of a kid. I don\u2019t want him bringing that animosity and toxicity to my department. The dept is my safe space and my family, and the last thing I want is him intruding. If anyone else from the school joined I\u2019d be fine with it. Every month we have the whole fire company come in for a monthly meeting where we solve the world\u2019s problems, discuss upcoming trainings and vote in new members. What should I do if his name comes up? What should I do now? I need advice.",

    "postText": "About a month ago, I posted about putting my late daughter's phone through the wash. She passed away in 2018 after diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor.  She was only 8 years old.  \n\nI  was absolutely devastated at the time, and you all were so kind, and  really helped me calm down that night.  After taking the advice from people here, I put it in rice and didn't touch it for over a month. I am so happy to report that I tried it for the first time today, and the phone works  perfectly!  All pictures and data are there.  I am backing it all up  today!  I am so happy to have a little piece of her back. \n\nI hope this brought someone  a smile today, I know it makes me smile thinking about all the people  out there finding a bit of joy in memory of my sweet angel daughter.",

Rice does absorb some of the water in the phone but it's fairly passive. So it will absorb what it comes in contact with. There could still be water left inside.\n\nInstead a better way to do it is to run a fan over the device. Even if it doesn't blow directly where the water is, the airflow over any openings will create a vacuum to actively suck out the water and prevent internal components from rusting and do a better job overall. Don't use a blow dryer as the heat cant also cause issues with the electronics.",

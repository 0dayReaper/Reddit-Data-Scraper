    "postText": "I was so excited when I finally figured it out that I thought it would be appropriate to share it with others. I have personally been struggling with bad breath since I was 10 years old for several reasons.\n\nWhen I was 10, I had tonsil stones and didn't really know what they were. At that age, I thought that it was food coming back up, so I ignored it for 6 years, until I did my research in high school. I removed them myself thinking that it would help, but it actually made it worse. I was bullied by others who continuously commented \"Your breath smells like sh\\*t.\" At that point, I begged my mother to take me to an ENT and scheduled an appointment to get my tonsils removed. The doctors told me that they should have been removed years ago because they were \"highly infected.\" After I got them removed, I thought I was home free to continue brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash with no bad breath. WRONG!\n\nAfter I got my tonsils removed, I still had bad breath. I researched again and decided to buy a tongue scrapper, but it didn't work. I was at a standstill again for about another couple of years until I looked up that the ingredient in most toothpaste was sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which can dry your mouth out. I did have dry mouth, so I started focusing on buying toothpaste without that ingredient. I also started using alcohol free mouthwash, and it still didn't work. I was back on the path of spending lots of money buying different products that had no effect on me.\n\nI later researched that post nasal drip could cause bad breath, which I had. I went to the doctor, and they told me to buy over the counter nasal spray. I used it thinking that it was all over. NOPE!\n\nFrom there, I thought that everything was coming from my stomach because my oral health was not the problem at this point, so I started eating healthy foods in hopes that it would help, but it didn't.\n\nThen, I started flossing after every meal, and it only helped temporarily, so I knew there was another problem.\n\nI kept reading forums online about people who cured their bad breath, and I read across someone who said that they started using oral probiotics that contained BLIS M18. I bought several bottles hoping that this would finally be my eureka... It wasn't. That, too, was also a temporary solution.\n\nAfter everything I tried, I thought there was no hope for me, but then I came across the post that talked about using diluted hydrogen peroxide (HP) as a mouthwash. My dentist makes me use diluted HP every time I came in, so I figured it was safe. I brushed and flossed like I normally did and then swished to solution in my mouth, even brushed it on my tongue, and IT WORKED! I finally had a long term effect. For the rest of the day, my breath was fine. I didn't think it was possible. Then, the next morning, I woke up with very little morning breath when it's usually very bad in the morning. I don't use the solution daily, only when I feel the need to. I'm hoping that my post will reach someone because I have struggled with this for most of my life, and it has really dampened my confidence, but not anymore. If I can figure it out, then you can too.\n\nEDIT: OMG! Thank you guys for the support! I honestly didn't think this would get this much recognition lol\n\nFor those wondering, I used half and half for the HP solution. I literally bought the store brand kind, and it worked for me. I used to 3% in the brown bottle that you can buy in the store. You can dilute it more if you feel the need to. I also still use the oral probiotics occasionally. You can look up any online that have BLISH M18 in it. Most of them have good reviews.\n\nWhen it comes to the process, I floss and brush first. I personally use Sensodyne since it doesn't have SLS in it (at least the one I used). From there, I take the half and half solution and swish and gargle it for 30 - 45 seconds. Then, I rinse it with water to make sure it's all out. I also put some on my toothbrush and scrub my tongue with it. Sometimes I use the chewable oral probiotics afterwards if I felt the need to.\n\nAlso, I don't smoke, I hardly drink coffee, I eat fairly healthy, I don't have diabetes or tonsils anymore, so some may have other issues than me.",

People who have amalgam fillings and use hydrogen peroxide did not have levels of mercury that were detectable in their organs, blood, skin, etc.\n\nPersonally, I think if you have 3 or so amalgam fillings you will be fine. If you're mouth is 25% fillings then avoid it. The peroxide causes the metal to oxidize and lose it's surface integrity, allowing the metal to wear down.",

I also started using hydrogen peroxide around a month ago. I definitely don\u2019t want to worry anyone unnecessarily, especially because it seems to work long term for lots of people, but after a few weeks it started to become less effective for me: the odour started coming back and I had to start using it more and more regularly. Couple that with the grey area in terms it\u2019s effects on dental health (enamel etc.) and I stopped using it. This may not be an issue for you, however if it is, about 2 weeks ago now I started using a new product: Therabreath mouthwash. You might have heard of it before, I\u2019m not sure, but regardless I strongly recommend giving it a go. It\u2019s working for me like almost nothing else has, and seems pretty safe and easy to use (no annoying dilution process like with hydrogen peroxide). Just wanted to mention in case this might help anyone! Good luck to all out there suffering with this shit, it sucks.",

After like 30 years, of switching deodorants every week or two, I read an article that talked about how sweat doesn't cause odors, the bacteria on our skin does. I use an antibacterial soap (diluted Dawn dish soap the  orange anti bacterial kind works best for me) under my arms and then a soap free wash on the rest of me. It was a miracle. Of course, daily showers and all that, but I don't have to take multiple showers a day now.",

Growing up, I didn't realize my mouth was constantly dry from being somewhat dehydrated. I hated drinking water, so my main source of hydration was milk during meal time. So I'd end up having 2-3 full size glasses of milk with meals, not realizing that it wasn't normal to be so thirsty (I was pretty small and would then get bloated from drinking too much too quickly). So thank you! I'm going to try a few of your suggestions.",

I avoid SLS in toothpaste because it causes bad canker sores. I've had a TON of luck with CLO SYS toothpaste (the fluoride 'gentle mint' variety). You can find it on amazon from their official store or at some pharmacies, though I've only really had luck online.   \n\n\nSharing in hopes that someone might find the product helpful as it's really made my oral care a lot better.",

I spread a drop between my toes &amp;/or under each arm in anticipation of extended sweaty tasks. I also treat wounds &amp; abrasions with it. It's so very versatile!\n\n\\^\\^NB\\^\\^\n\n**Caution!** Clove oil can and will feel *'burn-y'* on some skin-types, prior to making numb. The body will gradually reduce this reaction over time, but to my knowledge, no-one develops a full immunity to this effect \\~ It's very much the same as happens with chillie afficionadoes who 'get used to' otherwise quasi-lethal doses of capsaicin!\n\n**Beware!** Do not get clove oil onto 'sensitive skin' areas, specifically your other mucosa \\[inside nose, anus, genitals\\]. The effect of doing so is akin to that of getting chillie-juice into the same places!\n\n**Palliative!**  If you need to 'flush' clove oil from anywhere in/on your body, only oils will speedily do the job... I use pure olive oil &amp;/or fresh dairy cream for this, the latter, particularly orally, as you can swallow it as a food item, which you cannot normally do with vegetable oils, really.",

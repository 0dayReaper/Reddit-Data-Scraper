    "postText": "He\u2019s 19. He has a nasal tumor and it\u2019s spreading under his skin. I give him medicine each day which helps delay the growth somewhat, but his right eye is now completely covered. He can only see out of the left one now. Just 3 days ago his right eye was still half visible. Out of nowhere, the cancer has sped up. The tumor is only on the outside and hasn\u2019t gone internal. He still eats, drinks, meows, he purrs, pees and poops. His cognitive abilities haven\u2019t declined, he\u2019s alert and responsive. He\u2019s still acting like his usual self and not acting like he\u2019s in pain. He sleeps well and snuggles on me. However, his nose is stuffy and he sniffles loudly. He has bloody boogers that ooze out and he licks them away. I told myself this whole time that as long as he\u2019s not in pain, it would be wrong to put him down. I don\u2019t know anymore. I guess I need more outside perspectives on this.\n\nMy fears: What if I\u2019m wrong? What if he\u2019s put down but he still had more time to spend that wasn\u2019t unreasonable? What if I don\u2019t make the right call? Or, what if he is in pain and we just can\u2019t see it? Am I an awful pet owner? Selfish?",

Was lucky to get a vet over within 90 minutes to end his suffering. I regret letting him get to that place. \nI feel you.",

He still purred when getting belly rubs.  He still laid in his favorite spot in the sun outside.   One day I came home and there was something missing in his eyes.   He peed in the kitchen (something he never did) and just laid in it.   I called the vet and she said he was telling me it was time.   I think I already knew that.  Keep watching for his signs.   I'm sorry you are going through this.",

But am still conflicted :( that was a month ago. My brother saw my cat the other day and was very shocked, he can\u2019t bring himself to look at his face. That started to make me doubt my judgment.",

            "comment": "Have you looked into options for surgery and treatment, since it's not internal? Do you have access to another vet/animal hospital for a second opinion on treatability?\n\nPurring isn't always a sign of comfort, it can also be used as comfort - cats can purr when they are in pain or scared/worried to try to comfort themselves and each other. It's almost impossible to known whether a cat is in pain unless it's a specific spot or very progressed.\n\nDoes he still play?\n\nBlood from the nose sounds extremely worrying, and since it's progressing quickly and have already been a month since the checkup you probably should call them again. If the visit stresses him out you can do a video call or just call for advice on whether to bring him in, but since he is heading quickly towards his demise I think you need a lot more frequent checkups... Like at least once a week, to quickly manage any pain you might miss.\n\nAnd considering how much the progression had sped up just over three days you need to get a follow-up evaluation today. New symptoms and new progression means you need new treatment and new advice. \n\nBleeding from the nose is still bleeding from the nose, regardless of if he licks it up or not.",

Especially since he has a significant heart murmur this one vet was saying just going under anesthesia would be very risky. He\u2019s never been the type to play, so am not sure how to tell if he\u2019s feeling energetic. As for his purring he\u2019s doing it while I\u2019m giving him treats so hopefully that means he\u2019s happy somewhat. The bloody nose was the very first sign that something was wrong. He started getting them last winter and sneezing a lot. Then a bump appeared and it\u2019s just gone downhill since. I\u2019m not sure what the vet could do now, they all recommend the steroid and antibiotic he currently takes. Maybe I could get him some pain medication though just in case.",

That's rather impressive! \n\nI can't tell you what to do aside from getting a new consultation with these new progressions, and definitely ask pain medications just to see if he has any positive change in behaviour with them (which would indicate that the was in pain without them). \n\nI understand you're worried about saying goodbye too soon. It's the hardest decision we have to make for our pets. Since he's that old and have another condition he wouldn't have more than a few years anyway, and seeing as this is on his face and airways, it's spreading quickly and is not going to get better, I don't think the time between now and \"mostly suffering\" is going to be more than six months, and possibly just weeks if it keeps spreading like this. Note that I am not a vet, I have no insight into his health, and this is very much an uneducated guess, but I really don't think you'll be robbing him of any significant time with quality life if you decide not to wait.\n\nConsult with your vet about this latest development, ask about pain meds and (if you only do a phone consultation) ask to send them a video or pictures of his current state.\n\nAre you already monitoring his temperature? Otherwise that's another thing you can do daily at home to check for changes in his health he might be hiding.",

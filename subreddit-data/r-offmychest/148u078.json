    "postText": "She was about 10/15 years older. Together with 2 other friends we started a \"girls only group\". We created an acronym of our initials and had a book where we would write in the things we did and our thoughts... she taught us some ballroom dancing (since then I just love it).\nShe got married more than 20 years ago and we sort of lost contact... life happened... but we saw each other occasionally.\nYesterday my brother wrote me she had a braintumor and did not survive the surgery..\n\nI wrote her sister(we reconnected 4 years ago) that I think of her and wish her and her family strength... but I did not feel much...\n\nNow it is in the middle of the night and it is hitting me...\n\nI had therapy today and we found out that I am really \"good\" at compartmentalizing... he asked me if it makes it easier for me to process loss... it did not even come to my mind that she died - I already had put it in a box.\n\nNow I am feeling sad... I feel tears \"wanting\" to come up... those memories of our times together are popping up...\n\nI am glad I am able to at least feel something... but at the same time I just want to sleep and be able to start working in about 6 hours...\n\nBut I also know if I want to get a better mental health, I need to allow those feelings to surface and not just \"swallow them\" or \"put them in a box\"",

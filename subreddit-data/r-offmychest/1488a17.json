    "postText": "A few days ago, I went on a walk in the park while listening to music. It had been several weeks since I broke up with my girlfriend. As I walked through the park, I realized I felt a coldness but it wasn\u2019t because of the weather.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, I felt lonely.\n\nI know that I am only feeling this way because I was so used to being with someone else for so long, but man, it was a reality check. Even though I enjoy my own company, it just hit really different this time around.\n\nI sat and said to myself \u201cYou are not alone\u201d. I know the feeling will soon pass.",

Was lonely for a long time, had my first relationship (I'm in my early twenties) a month ago, lasted for a month (ldr didn't work), and it really hits even more now that I'm lonely. Well I mean I have friends ofc, but there's a difference between friends and gf lol.\n\nAnyway, not sure if dating is for me. I kinda like the thought of being alone now, there doesn't come any hurt from it. And at the same time I hate the thought of being alone, but that's because I got suddenly broken up with and went from getting affection 100 to affection 0 in seconds and now I miss that.\n\nIdk man, you will find someone again. If you want to.",

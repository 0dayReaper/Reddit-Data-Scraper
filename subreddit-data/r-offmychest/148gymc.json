    "postText": "Hey just wanted to let of some things been thinking bout while I still remember. I (20f) am currently going through a really bad health issues ... From severe insomnia to memory loss and seizures. It's becoming increasingly difficult to do things. I'm always tired but can never sleep. My seizures are painful and doctors don't know what to do. Those same doctor can't even help me sleep. I've tried everything. To exercise, training my body, diet, no TV, sleep meds etc all of it... I cant sleep at all... It's like my body built up a tolerance to any medicine or remedy. Sometimes I'll go days with only 5 hours total sleep for the week. My seizures have put me out of commission I can't work until I get cleared/ at least find a job that can be accommodating. All of this seizure stuff started randomly with no explanation. Even then I can't legally drive anymore. There is no remote job that wanna hire me either it seems. I've only save up emergency money in case something like this happens for up to three months. I run out next month. The stress of trying to get healthy, paying for bills, sleep is just making me feel like a failure and I'm rlly trying. I'm trying to push myself to keep going and at least attempt the now impossible. But damn it's rlly hard when you are losing your being. \nThank for listening to me",

    "postText": "Nothing bad happened, just lately I have been in a slump. I have no energy to do anything anymore. Everyday is the same and it hurts. My mother\u2019s health is declining. She isn\u2019t dying or anything, it\u2019s just old age catching up to her. Last year she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and last week she was diagnosed with osteoporosis. Now she doesn\u2019t want to take the osteoporosis medication because she\u2019s \u201con too many medications\u201d. She has to take 7 different pills for 4 different conditions and she\u2019s only 59. I try to exercise with her but everyday she is constantly so weak and tired. The doctors just say the same thing over and over again and keep throwing pills at her which urges her to be even more non compliant. I feel like I\u2019m losing her and nothing I do helps. I feel so isolated and alone, i have no friends and I cut off my family (other than mom). The only thing I have to look forward to is work because at least I can forget how miserable I am for 8 hours and get paid for it.",

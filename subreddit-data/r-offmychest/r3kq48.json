I\u2019ve always done whatever it was for my patients. I would\u2019ve taken a bullet, ran through IED infested fields, died for my brothers, got COVID, worked back to back 10 hour shifts because everyone else quit, the fucking list goes on. My urgent care department and ICU are entirely full of unvaccinated fucking morons right now. They\u2019re fucking up everything for patients who actually need our care and can\u2019t get into the emergency department at our hospital due to them also being swarmed with fuckheads. I\u2019ve never thought this, but after having over 150 patients a day with only three providers and our nurses crying in our lab, I\u2019m over it. I\u2019m tired of so many patients thinking it\u2019s bullshit until they\u2019re sitting on deaths door and beginning for treatment. I\u2019m tired of working 60 hour weeks because we\u2019re so understaffed. \n\nI\u2019ve always felt like this was my calling. I\u2019ve loved patient care and interacting with patients, taking care of them, making sure they felt comfortable and safe, and this last week has truly changed me. \n\nWhen the news broke out about the Omicron variant, I immediately hoped that it was the most lethal yet, and that it just wrecked havoc on the population, and that was such a horrible thing of me to think and I\u2019ve never felt like this. I don\u2019t even care at this point and I want people who are still doubting the severity of this virus to suffer. \n\nEven writing this I feel bad, but part of me is just over it all. I am emotionally dead after struggling so much for the past two years.",

            "comment": "I just got out of the hospital yesterday. Missed Thanksgiving. Small bowel obstruction, hernia. My nurses were the very best people I've met in years. I tried asking how \"the whole situation with covid\" was going. They just got blank faces. They wouldn't discuss it. They talked about how they didn't mind working on the holiday. They talked about their plans for when they got off shift. They did their jobs so wonderfully. But all that came after I sat in the ER for 14 hours. On a pad with blood spots on it, cause there was no where to put me. I cannot, simply cannot, imagine what you guys are going through. It's one thing to ask someone to do their job to the utmost of their abilities to the point of breaking, it's another to tell them to do it again the next day. But to do that for almost 2 years now. I cannot fathom it. Thank you for what you do, and for all your coworkers.",

I have watched through our charting system as my patients have sat in the ER for over 24 hours for things that would normally get them admitted and moved to a bed or the ICU in a couple of hours too many times.

I am fully vaccinated, currently waiting for my booster appointment that's scheduled in two weeks (as two weeks from now is the soonest I can get it/six months from my last vaccine), wear only N95's anytime I leave my home because I don't trust that those not wearing masks are actually vaccinated and I've been wearing them since before this pandemic even happened because I get sick so easily when my illness was flaring. I've gotten really lucky the past year, and now I'm worried.. do I not get lucky this time? Is my luck going to run out? I've had to stop one of my treatments and am having to get my portacath surgically removed because there's such a lack of nurses right now that I'm unable to have the care I'm supposed to even be having, partly due to some nurses having to be fired from their opinions on not wanting to be vaccinated themselves (c'mon!!!). This is scary.\n\nI wish you the best. Thank you for what you do and I hope you don't lose all hope in your job and your passion, because having a chronic illness it means a lot when I go to the hospital and I'm being cared for by someone who really loves what they do.",

For years whenever I heard about the Holocaust, be it in school, or reading history books or watching videos based on WW2, the one thing that I simply couldn't understand was HOW it happened. How did so many people agree to do the things that they did? How did so many share the same views as Hitler and were proud nazis? But seeing how selfish and ignorant so many people have been during this pandemic, has made things clear for me. Particularly because these people know that their actions can quite literally put other people's lives in danger, and yet they don't care... I really wish this could have gone a different way, but at least now we know what our fellow  citizens are like.\n\nEdit: because I am tired and wrote \"how did people agreed\" and \"how did many shared\". English is obviously not my first language huh",

On FB people only get on their feed what their friends post (oftentimes they only friends who share the same opinions). They see posts from pages they, sprinkled with some ads also tailored to them. Then they can go on a specific forum that supports their views/opinions, go to subreddits where people also share the same ideas.\n\n Sometimes even leave the main social medias when they have some friends that disagree with them (like what happened with many leaving FB to go to Parler). Then they go to Youtube and watch videos that support their views, so the algorithm suggests similar content, and then we end up with people that ONLY consume what supports their biased, and often ignorant, opinions.\n\nIt is scary to witness how easy it is to live in a bubble, unaware of how the rest of the world works, incapable of listening to different points of view, lacking common sense and self awareness, not really understanding what \"research\" means. And then having millions of people supporting the same views... then again, I shouldn't be surprised, considering how bad the education system is (thinking of the US in particular) and how little value people place on education and knowledge, or at least they show they don't value it by showing they don't trusts scientists and medical professionals.",

Honestly, I can never understand the pain you\u2019re feeling, but I understand that you care for the well-being of others.

My mom was an RN for over 30 years in the 1950's - 80's ,and would tell me how difficult the job was lifting, moving, cleaning patients, dealing with abusive angry depressed old people.  back then there was no covid anti-vaxers.  Doctors would prescribe treatments and generally were listened to but with some skepticism.  Nurses however were considered the frontline practitioners of basic face to face health care delivery and patients tended to listen to nurses advice and follow it without question.  even so my mom was frustrated, overworked, and depressed because of the demands of the job.  sometimes she would work doubles and sleep through the next few days off.\n\nAll I can say is we the vaccinated thank you for your sacrifices, take this pandemic seriously, believe in science,  don't want you to waste your time treating patients who could have prevented their illness with a simple vaccination, and hear what you are saying.  i hope, once this pandemic is over, you will find a way to rekindle the fire for helping people you once had.

I truly sympathize with you guys in the ER. Sometimes we have to perform removals in the ICU itself and I can see they look of exhaustion on most of your faces. God bless you all.",

            "comment": "I've often wondered what would actually happen if Covid, in all its variants was lethal to people with a feeble intellect rather than a feeble immune system. While I don't work in the medical field, I've seen how society as a whole, save for a handful of idiots reacted to instructions when Spanish Flu spread around the world with returning troops from WWI. You can't blame the troops for bringing it home, initially Spanish Flu symptoms were very similar to those of the common cold, until they escalate. People were instructed to wear masks, keep their distance and try to limit unnecessary travel back then, almost nobody argued with health authorities. Today, the nutcases seem to spread their BS faster than the virus.\n\nI'm West Australian, and despite pressure from other states and Canberra (federal government) our state government slammed the borders shut, hard. In order to be allowed into the state, you had to quarantine for 14 days, the known incubation time of the virus. Since it started in March, from a population of about 2.1 million, in the past two years there have been about 10 deaths and 1200 cases overall in the time since. Anyone caught breaking quarantine faces a hefty fine and potential jail time. Many states have also made it mandatory for many professions to be vaccinated against this virus, yet we still have these morons and their rallies, which to me boils down to \"DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!\" Fine. Would you rather be at home with something like the flu, or spend a couple of weeks in the ICU and possibly die?\n\nI don't blame you for thinking the way you do. In some ways, it would be like watching Darwin's theory of natural selection at work. The fact that you've been a combat medic, I can definitely understand your annoyance at these idiots clogging your ICU. Early in the pandemic, I remember reading about some US church pastors declaring \"lockdowns are for wimps!\" Then dying of Covid. If you were religious, you might say it was God saying \"I've had just enough of your stupidity, I'm shutting that down right now!\"\n\nI hope once this crap storm settles down, you get the chance to take a decent vacation. You'd be long overdue for one now",

Hand sanitizer and masks in all my work trucks got the vaccine as soon as we could. May have had COVID back in March 2020. She's so high risk they told her not to get tested because if she didn't have it and got tested she would be putting herself at greater risk of getting it. She spent a month in bed doing her inhaler every hour and a half being told if she had to do it that often fine but only go to the hospital if it was dire because she likely wouldn't be let out again until she was all better. Every morning I would get up and make sure the worst hadn't happened (slept in the basement to limit contact). The people who don't take this seriously haven't seen it up close. They haven't lost loved ones. I think I ended up with it because for probably 4 months after that I wasn't able to take normal full breaths. Like I was always playing catch up on breathing after a good workout but it was all the time. I understand the sentiment of \"ya know what? Fuck 'em all.\" People in my area are ridiculous about it. I want them to feel what it's like. The fear of wondering every morning if the one you love is still alive. How you would go about explaining it to your child. I nearly died of appendicitis as a kid and had a crappy 2 month recovery. Having to see her like that, having to worry all the time, having to plan for what ifs. Easily the worst month of my life and assholes out there mocking it because of whatever dumb reason they want to justify it. I also own a business so I can't risk the backlash of having a public opinion so I just quietly seeth as people make light of it. It sucks. It really really sucks.",

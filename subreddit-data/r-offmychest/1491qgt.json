I also tended to get over on people and looked down upon those who didn't meet my standards. It's been a long, hard look in the mirror, but I'm ready to be a better person. :(",

Not many people can honestly reflect on themselves in such a way.\n\nLove all parts of yourself unconditionally, including this \"toxic and harmful\" version. The point is to grow and evolve, don't beat yourself up. Get excited, you're ready to welcome more positive and meaningful connections in your life.",

    "postText": "I got my masters degree back in 2021, and my dream has always been to be an academic advisor. I went on a couple interviews and even made it to stage 2 with some then they completley ghosted me. The same job postings are still up. I have a decade of experience working in mental health, administration, data entry (psychological research and working with data bases) and more. I have A LOT of experience in so many different paths. Still havent been able to land a job in something. I keep applying to academic advisor, registrar, enrollment, student involvement, and student success jobs. Havent heard back from anyone. Just feels like im being blackballed. When people hear about this they always ask where am I applying- literally every school district in my state. Every single one multiple times, multiple positions. Its THOUSANDS of cover letters. The only jobs that have taken me in the meantime are shitty customer service ones. Im just so tired of doing this dance. Give me the job damn it.",

My fianc\u00e9 and I are looking for jobs in a new area and it is discouraging not getting any calls back or any interested employers. The best advice I can give you is to keep on applying. You can only be given a \u201cno\u201d so many times before you are given a \u201cyes\u201d. While you are not in your field currently, it is still good that you have a customer service job so you are able to pay the bills in the meantime.",

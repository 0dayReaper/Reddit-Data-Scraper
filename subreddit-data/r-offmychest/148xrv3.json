    "postText": "For context, I'm a 25 year old male. I'm almost done with my bachelor's degree in psychology, I have friends and accomplishments, a good job and I keep fit, but my small size at only 3.5 inches tends to keep my confidence down when I think about confessing my feelings to a girl. In the past, previous partners, when we get to the stage about discussing intimacy and sex, have laughed at me or grown colder when they learn of my penis size; I have also been single for 8 years now.",

And eventually you get past the porn mind which says size matters. \n\nFemales want dick and they also want stability. You just offer stable coc \n\nOr claim your a Virgin saving yourself for marriage then swoop on a fine religious girl",

    "postText": "I noticed that when I was younger, my parents never used to punish my brother the same way that they would punish me and it was commonly known that my brother was the \u201cbrains\u201d of the family and I was just a stupid little girl who was always hyperactive and never could keep quiet. \n\nI used to be abused by my dad and so was my mum, until last year when he was arrested. Recently, my family have been blaming me for getting CPS involved in our family (they got called, I didn\u2019t call them) and blaming me for not knowing that my dad was abusive (I was very young and confused, didn\u2019t really know much about abuse until I was 14)\n\nThe stuff with my mum has gotten extremely worse recently. \n\nShe will scream at me if I need a lift somewhere or need something (this is often as I always forget things) but if my brother finds himself in that situation, she will only ever get slightly annoyed but not scream in the same way that she does at me. \n\nI am usually only allowed something/to go somewhere (without punishment) if my brother wants it too. \n\nSometimes, my brother will need her to go out and I\u2019ll go with her but it will be me who is punished for this.\n\nOn several occasions, my mum has asked me to lie to family members to cover her back and I\u2019ve done it, but she has covered up my brother stealing from me in the past and made me seem crazy for being hurt.\n\nShe has physically hurt me when annoyed that I need something from a shop.\n\nShe often tells me to go away if I go downstairs so I\u2019m expected to leave everyone alone and go back upstairs. \n\nShe uses the fact that she helped me a lot when I was very mentally ill (even though she also yelled and screamed at me over it as well) to manipulate me during arguments.\n\nI have a boyfriend and she kept talking about me to my brother and accusing me of being pregnant and saying she\u2019s going to force me to take a pregnancy test.\n\nShe lets my brother make extremely inappropriate jokes that make me uncomfortable and I \u201coverrract\u201d (I\u2019m autistic)\n\nI have food problems because of autism and need food that others don\u2019t eat. Sometimes, I\u2019ll go food shopping but one random day, I\u2019ll feel like I can\u2019t eat anything we have and need something different. We\u2019re not well off but not poor and she would do it if my brother asked.\n\nIf I go shopping and then go back to my friends house, I have to call her and say I\u2019m going there. If I don\u2019t call or miss calls, I get screamed at. I am literally 20. \n\nI\u2019m not allowed to move out.",

You're going to make mistake and then question every decision you've made.\n\nBut that's what happens to everybody who has to do things on their own.  It can take a long time to figure out what you're doing, but eventually things start to fall into place and the next thing you know, you're rolling along like you've done it all your life.",

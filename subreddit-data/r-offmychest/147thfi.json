    "postText": "I'm dogsititing for a friend with a hot tub. My boyfriend and I had planned on hanging out in the hot tub and then I was going to spend the night at his place. He lives right down the road from the friend with the hot tub. When I went to pick my boyfriend up, he had this zoned out look and said he wasn't feeling well. I offered to just hang out with him at his place. He said that he wanted to go and that maybe he would start to feel better. We had been at a bar the night before, so he thought that he was just a little hungover. When we pulled up to my friend's house, I asked him again if he was sure he didn't want to just go back home. Once again, he declined. So, as we were sitting in the hot tub, he started to look worse. I thought I was going to have to carry him out of the hot tub. I got him seated down, dried him off,  and then asked him all the medical questions. Like when he last ate, has he had any vomiting/ diarrhea, when it started, other symptoms, and if he had taken any other meds. He could barely move. It was like he was just frozen in place. Then he admitted that he felt like he was having a depressive episode. He has bipolar disorder, and he was very upfront with that before we started dating. I got some stuff together and got him home. We just held each other and cried on the sofa. Then I told him we were going to take a shower, change, and go to bed. I bathed him, and just little spoon held him as I sobbed into his back. I asked him that night what his favorite warm breakfast food was and brought the ingredients back with me after I went to my morning shift. By the end of the next day, he was starting to seem back to himself. I haven't told him much about my parent's divorce. He doesn't know that getting a dog saved my life. He doesn't know that my mom had severe depression and I was her rock (as a young teenager). He thought my medical background prepared me for what to do. Actually, it was life experience.",

            "comment": "As someone with bipolar, this post, despite being about depression, was really nice to read about someone having a really wonderful and understanding partner. I\u2019m terribly sorry you learned about depression from your parents at such a young age. But hearing such empathy in how you helped him is really amazing, especially with not just getting angry at him for having something out of his control. I truly wish you both the best; I know having a partner with bipolar can be really difficult, but thank you for showing such support and understanding.",

Can\u2019t really say anything about the situation with his medication since I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s taking, and what I\u2019ve seen it\u2019s different than what we use in my country. And of course the side effects are different for everyone. \n\nIt\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re ready and willing to support him. Mental health issues aren\u2019t easy, not for the one who\u2019s suffering or the people around them. Remember to take care of yourself too.\n\nMay I ask how long ago your boyfriend was diagnosed and what the process was like? Bipolar is hard to diagnose and other mental health problems are often diagnosed as bipolar. From what I\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re pretty fast to slap that diagnosis on the table and prescribe a medication in the US. Just wondering if he was misdiagnosed or if this was something else, since depressive episodes are usually much longer than a day or two.\n\nI hope you and your boyfriend are feeling better!",

But I get the mild skepticism about the diagnosis, the system for mental diagnosis in the US is pretty shitty.\n\n(I could be wrong as it's been a while, but this is just something i remembered from psychology class)",

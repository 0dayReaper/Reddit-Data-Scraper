Their motives by definition are against my constitution (separation of church and state). I am not a Christian I do not feel safe living in a country that uses the Bible to write policy. The front runner for the Supreme Court seat wants to live under Christian rule. If you support anything the GOP has done FUCK YOU.",

Out of those signs, I've only seen one for Biden, all the rest have been for Trump. I've also seen a couple \"Farmers For Trump\" signs too. And they aren't just in run down yards here, they're everywhere. Nice houses, shitty houses, in front of businesses...\n\nTrump has completely killed the farmers' way of life, and his one solution is to throw money at us to buy our votes. Any farmer who says they are against socialism, but takes this next round of CFAP money deserves to be slapped in the face. Unfortunately, most farmers can't not take the money. They will have to in order to survive, and many won't survive even then. \n\nI'm so worn down by it all. Constantly shocked that my neighbors, friends, people of our ag community are so blind to the damage that he has caused. I was in a meeting about a month ago, I attended virtually, but most people attended in person. The meeting was made up of farmers from about a 50 mile radius.The point of the meeting was to advise a banking board of directors. They chose some of their most knowledgeable and trusted customers for this meeting. One of the questions that was asked was about how farming operations were handling changes that COVID has brought. One of the farmers' answered that he wasn't that concerned about COVID. He was more worried about antifa and the BLM \"riots\" and that he was taking financial steps to secure himself and his operation. I cannot describe the anger, frustration, hopelessness and I don't even know what feeling I had when I heard him say that. Luckily, the meeting host stepped in and suggested that we take a break. When we all came back, the next question put to us was where do we, as farmers, go to get trusted advice. They were angling for answers like seed, fertilizer, chemical dealers, bankers, other farmers etc. I shit you not, one of the answers, from a different guy than the first one, was \"cable news\". I just silently sat through the rest of the meeting unless I was specifically called on. I couldn't, and still can't, fathom the arrogance and ignorance of some of these \"trusted\" farmers. Especially knowing that the majority of the farmers I know believe exactly the same thing.",

And it absolutely abuses the religion. I know I also have no right to judge others' faith or whatever, but I'm pretty sure most of us have enough common sense to know that these are in no way decent. Society is constantly changing, generations are constantly changing, the entire world is never stagnant. And if they are insistently dogmatic and implement such old-minded ideas, the world will suffer a catastrophe. But it seems that that common sense has flown out their window a long time ago.",

Small town, Southern Baptist school in Alabama. \n\nThe shit they push on kids is so fucking horrifying. My history classing were, at best Western-chauvanist fan-fiction. Religion was jammed into every lesson, and any question about the merits of faith was met with retribution from the staff. I watched them expell a gay kid for his sexuality, after staff routinely encouraged kids to treat him differently. I watched them expel a kid who lost his faith because he started sharing his story with others. \n\nSay nothing for the academics, because my first year of college was ROUGH. Turns out I needed algebra more than I needed Noah's Ark. Big shock. \n\nYears later, some of the adults that I used to respect, still brigand my social media. One of them went on a fuckkng tirade about how he was so sure college wouldn't liberalize someone like me, and how he was so disappointed with how brainwashed I was by the 'secular world.' Like, dude, college didn't make me detest your religion, you did.",

Look at how the BLM protests are now almost singly referred to as \"riots\". \n\nWe need to find ways to better educate people, and encourage people to access more information and think for themselves. That's difficult when the education system is so severly flawed, but unfortunately that same education bottleneck causes other issues to be more important for most at least in the short term. People don't care about overhauling schooling and fostering a curious and continually learning population when they can't afford their medicine and have to worry about job security.",

The individual books were all written separately over hundreds of years, the earliest books being written recordings of oral traditions (Genesis, Exodus, etc). Some books (Leviticus, Deuteronomy) were written as laws and instructions for the people. Most books are compiled from poetry, letters, and other writings. The Christian Bible was canonized in the 4th century at the behest of the Roman Emperor Constantine. \n\nSo parts were written to guide governing bodies, but most wasn't, and in the 4th century things deemed too radical were left out. Highly recommend looking at the Gnostic Gospels for that.",

This will extend the death throes of the religious right wingers. It could possibly create a new age of ignorance and religion (that's their hope). If we allow this it will be the end of America and likely the world. As we know America would rather end it all than lose, and if you take our already poor educational system and make it worse, we are all very well fucked. Fuck the republicans. Fuck their way of life. Fuck their ideals. Fuck their racism. Fuck their segregation. Fuck their self supremacy. Fuck thier lack of empathy. Fuck their elitism. Fuck their wealth. Fuck their hypocrisy. Fuck their ignorance.

They've had a deathgrip on American culture since the earliest days of our nation's formation, and now they're realising that they're losing power.  Yeah, there's still lots of places where religion has a ball mentally fucking up children and turning them into adults that blindly accept authority and the truth of their faith (despite large numbers of 'em never reading their own holy book, but I digress).  They've fought for decades to dumb down the children of America, practically training them to reject scientific evidence outright with their nonsense creationist brain farts and, apparently now, rejection of common medical knowledge like the utility of face masks.   \n\n\nThey're gonna fight like hell, and the Democrats are far too weak a party to stand up against them. Republicans and Republican voters who have long associated God with Patriotism and the whole reason America exists, they'll have no problem with the mass of attempts to cull the rights of non-Christians, because they're the other. They're the enemy. Binary thinking strikes again...\n\nI guess all I'm saying is it's ok to acknowledge what's happening but don't assume they're gonna give up easy.",

            "comment": "Eh. Voting is the way. And I don't think the supreme court is going to end up radicalizing as much as many people want/fear. We're mostly being confronted with caustic, antagonistic jeering from both sides right now, not realistic threats of overturning long-held precedents. Even conservative pundits are agreeing on that. I'm NOT saying \"don't worry\" (go vote). But I am saying that secularism is not as vulnerable as both extremes would have you believe. \n\nWe are also being influenced by constructive interference media distorting and amplifying fears in order to cause a more extreme response than would be rationally justified. People on all sides are *working hard* to agitate unrest, and it's up to us to remain skeptical and seek the actual truth of the matter. Always question *everything* you read or hear, don't just accept all claims at face value.\n\nA part of me honestly wants to see Christian Dominionism try to re-assert power. They retreated after decades of failure and we've all forgotten how weak their arguments are. See: https://www.youtube.com/user/NatCen4ScienceEd. Their efforts keep popping up only to be shut down relatively quickly. I kinda look forward to seeing the march of extremely capable scientists, constitutional scholars, and human rights advocates publicly and thoroughly trounce anybody trying to argue biblical policies in legislatures, as they have for a hundred years. We've been in a quiet period because our predecessors were so damn effective at shutting them down (and continue to be - see NCSE).\n\nThe constitution is absolutely on the side of secularism. We are where we are today in a progressive society that excludes theocratic policies *because* their arguments are profoundly weak and full of easily exploitable holes. The founders knew and made decisions about what went into the constitution with that understanding, which is why they specifically did not empower any one religion. They foresaw the potential for corruption by the state on religion and corruption by religion on the state. They had been *living through* the failures and upheavals of religious issues in Europe. It was a living example to them of how *not to be* and they modelled the constitution with that in mind, empowering absolutely no religious authority, despite being overwhelmingly Christian in number. That says *a great deal* about what the founders did NOT want for the country. Educators have been able to exclude religious rhetoric from text books because it *is not science* and will *still* not be science after this.\n\nAnd hey, if they actually come through with some theocratic policies, we get to be punk rock motherfuckers again and ruin their happy little plans by injecting Islamic, Hindu, Satanic, Norse, Zoroastrian, etc, teachings right alongside their theocratic doctrines. The constitution protects that, and as much as the rhetoric about tearing down the wall of separation is in full swing, I doubt they'll get a toehold on that within any rational interpretation of the constitution. Even right-wing judges and pundits have to concede that.\n\nIt'll be so cute watching the campaign of little muslim kids saying Salah and little black-clad long haired kids invoking the Satanic prayer and every other religion on planet earth getting their place in the daily intercom prayers and the morning pledges and the daily invocations in legislature. There are over 4000 of them. If we do it right, we might only have to hear Christian dogma once every 11 years or so as they cycle between every religion, desperately clinging to avoid that policy being shut down again for violating the establishment clause.\n\nHonestly, a lot of people out there are inactive because they are either complacent (which despite rhetoric is *not* a bad thing - it means things are mostly working), are willing to allow others to fight their own battles, or are simply not inspired by the fights being fought. I, for one, would be inspired to fight that battle. The theocrats sure are. It'll be fun and educational to remind everyone *exactly why* religious thinking has chronically failed at persuasive argument for the past several centuries. The only hope for power of religious authority is force, and I don't think enough people would stand for that.\n\nFucking bring it, zealots. I look forward to our best minds arguing you into a corner and forcing you to confront your uncomfortable contradictions *very* publicly. We're more likely to see even more secular rulings come out of this as the dominionists bring out their very best stale, defeated arguments only to be publicly trounced as they have for decades. And it may force the supreme court to rule against them, establishing new and even more effective precedents for protection against theocratic policies.\n\nSecularism may be on its back foot, but that foot is *very firmly* planted in the fundamental wording of the constitution.\n\nWomen's rights, LGBT rights, etc are pretty firmly rooted at present. The only arguments against them are religious in nature, which makes them *undeniably weak*.",

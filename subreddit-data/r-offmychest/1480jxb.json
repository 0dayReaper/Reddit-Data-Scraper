    "postText": "There has been this new intern in our workplace, he's still a student but his internship is part of his studies, ill admit that he's not a fast learner and he repeats a lot of the mistakes and lacks the fundamentals, but i still don't like it at all when my co-workers make fun of him behind his back because of that. and i know that the kid is trying, and what even made me feel \"guilty\" is seeing his mom and sister waiting for him outside all excited for him. god damn i wish people were just nice and understanding once.",

Espicslly if it\u2019s something that they\u2019re comfortable doing in front of you, what do they do when others aren\u2019t around? How do they treat the intern when no one else can see? This is inappropriate workplace behavior and letting it stand is unwise",

A few people were making fun of a new teacher at my school because he is so disorganized and overwhelmed all the time and I just said to the group that everyone has different capacities and we have to be respectful of everyone\u2019s capacity. For example, I have a Dixie cup capacity when it comes to implementing technology in the classroom because I don\u2019t like it for a variety of reasons but I have a Great Lake worth of capacity when it comes to assessment and data analysis. Everyone kinda got quiet and reflected and were like \u201cyou\u2019re right\u201d. I said it with a smile and laugh so it wasn\u2019t serious or like an after school moment, but it got the point across.\n\nAnother teacher is optimistic and young and excited about everything and they were making fun of her. I just came to her defense, again with a smile and upbeat tone. I said I loved her and I miss being that excited about teaching and that I will protect her to keep her that way. I said I would fight them in the gym if they talked bad about it and we could put it on TikTok like the kids. They laughed and stopped at least around me. \n\nBut people who suck will always suck. You won\u2019t change that.",

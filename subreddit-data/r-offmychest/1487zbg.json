    "postText": "Yesterday, I had a work day from 8:30am-8:30pm. I woke up at 7am. I got home at 9pm. No naps, no breaks. My work was 8:30-5, and I had a class from 6-8:30. My commute to is an hour and my commute back was half an hour. When I say out of those 12ish hours I had nonstop focus for 10 of them, I mean it. I\u2019m starting a new internship at a new place and I have to put my best foot forward and the summer classes I\u2019m taking along with it accommodate with my internship. \n\nThese are my Mondays until the end of July. Sounds like fucking ass, right? \n\nMy best friend knows this. I called him at 8 to tell him I\u2019m coming home at 8:40 so he can walk me back 10 minutes to our home because we live in a somewhat sketchy area, especially at night time. He answered sleepily saying okay. \n\nI got to the station at 8:35, texted and apologized for being early, called him three times, texted him more with no answer back, and realized he probably slept on me because he\u2019s the most unreliable person I have ever fucking met. I called my dad hundreds of miles away and put him on in the background and started walking to my place. I would rather risk my life and mugged than wait for my best friend for who god knows when he\u2019ll wake up. \n\nI got back safely. And I was livid. I don\u2019t remember the last time I screamed my lungs out at him. It was an awful thing to do and my emotions control my actions (very immature, I know), but I feel so\u2026 justified. This isn\u2019t even the only careless thing he\u2019s done to me. This was the last straw. \n\nWe would walk together to work in the early morning. He\u2019s been late every. Single. Time. A couple minutes late isn\u2019t so bad? It is to someone who thinks every minute counts and starts feeling stressed as the seconds tick by. He\u2019s not going to fuck with my internship/career/life. \n\nHe really opened my eyes in how much he takes me for granted. Since we became friends three years ago, the amount of favors he asks me are simply impressive. Since living together this summer, he\u2019s broken two of my personal belongings after I was gracious enough to let him borrow my shit. \n\nHe knows I\u2019ve never been this stressed in my life with this job. He knows my Mondays are 12 hour days. He repays me by sleeping through with no responsibility of setting an alarm to protect her best friend. I\u2019m pretty sure even a decent acquaintance would do better. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. In the nicest way, I want him to stop interfering with me and my life for the rest of the summer. He\u2019s only contributing more to my stress.",

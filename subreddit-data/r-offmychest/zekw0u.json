    "postText": "Today I tried to do a nice thing for one of my coworkers. She mentioned she had a craving and so when I was getting my lunch I picked up the food and drink she wanted too on a whim. I gave it to her and went to the breakroom to eat.\n\nI guess I got the wrong type and flavor. When I came back from my lunch she told me to ignore the instant message she sent me. Naturally I read it since it was the first thing that popped up when i logged in. It was some not-so-nice things about me that she meant to send to our other coworker.\n\nI tried to keep my composure but I had to go to the bathroom to cry. I've always been kind of an outcast, but this was a huge blow because I thought my coworkers genuinely liked me.\n\nI feel like even at 28, no matter how hard I try to fit in and be nice, I somehow mess it up.",

And when this is triggered, they react unkindly like an emotional toddler or angsty teenager.\n\n\nIn my own life, once I'm able to understand that the reactions likely come from a place of sadness/despair from early on unmet needs, I at least have a little more compassion. And thought it doesn't necessarily change the interactions, I'm usually able to be detached from their behavior impacting my mood. Since I can be like \"oh this reaction actually isn't about me.\" \n\nIf it's a relationship where I am able to set a boundary without consequences of being fired from my job or something, I would probably say, something like ...\n\n\"huh, I've noticed you tend to (describe behavior) when I (describe triggering behavior). I can totally see that (describe triggering behavior) is really hard for you to see/do/be around. And I also am not ok with being yelled at (etc.).\"",

Some kind of physical and emotional need they never had met is being triggered and people simply react in immature ways without being very aware of their behavior. \n\nWhen this happens with my close friends or my husband, I usually am like \"huh, that's really interesting that you're reacting that way,\". \"Huh, I wonder what that's triggering inside you.\" Or just simply, \"hmm, that's an interesting reaction to (describe triggering behavior free of judgement).\"\n\nI don't recommend it to people you're afraid to offend \ud83e\udd2a my husband is used to it, and my best friends are really self aware and introspective. So they don't feel attacked when I make such an observation. Most people would feel attacked, even though it's a neutral statement. \n\nA more concrete example:\n\nI know for a former friend (let's call her Andrea), she was very triggered by a mutual friend who is super bubbly, happy, and kind.\n\nAndrea just saw her as really fake, because everyone that she'd encountered before who acted like they were faking happiness and actually very unhappy, catty, mean behind the facade. \n\nWhen Andrea was faced with someone genuinely kind and happy, she could not get past the idea that it was all an act.\n\nSo, TLDR version: it's about them, not you. But they probably aren't self aware enough to realize that and let themselves just be happy.",

His personality doesn\u2019t require people to like him lol and it\u2019s very freeing. He helped me see that they showed who they are, and there\u2019s no use getting upset over it. (I did anyways just for good measure, but was able to see what he meant after a good cry!) \n\nHe helped me see that they showed who they are, so now I\u2019m released from the need to get them to like me. I don\u2019t have to bend over backwards for them. I don\u2019t have to have their backs or do them favors. I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to hurt them, but I\u2019m released from the effort I was constantly putting in to win them over. \n\nYou seem like a nice person, and they don\u2019t appreciate that. Cool. They\u2019re not your problem anymore, and they don\u2019t get to delight in your kindness and generosity. You win! It\u2019s your own happy ending!",

As much as mean girl movies tell about bullying, excluding people is the more real form of showing dislike. \n\nYou probably are just different and maybe  very opinionated about things. While many people like to do stupid and mean things in a group. It might simply mean, they find the activities you do quite boring which is totally okay. \n\nIt's like stupid behavior gets more reasoning when a combined set of people do it  \n\nAll rational thinking goes out the window.",

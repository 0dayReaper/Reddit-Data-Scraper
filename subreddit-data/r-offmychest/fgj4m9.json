Because of you, a 2 pack of Clorox wipes is $50 and a big bottle of hand sanitizer is $50.\n\nStop stockpiling. You don\u2019t need all of it, and you\u2019re keeping it away from people who really do need it, coronavirus aside.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re someone who is buying out the stock to resell it for a profit: I hope that every time you\u2019re barefoot or wear just socks that you step on something cold and wet. I hope that you constantly get papercuts in between your fingers. I hope that there is a pebble in your shoe that you just can\u2019t get out. I hope that there in something pokey in your jeans, but when you go to get it, you can\u2019t find it. I hope that you get food stuck in your teeth and you can never find floss to get it out because some freak bought out the entire stock.\n\nEdit: I have to say, I appreciate that feedback, positive and negative. I appreciate hearing your side of things and getting to step into your lives as people in need. Thank you strangers for the awards! I had no clue this was going to blow up so much! Sending happy thoughts everyone\u2019s way!",

But it\u2019s driving me nuts because folks are raiding the shelves of stuff I\u2019D NORMALLY BE BUYING IN REASONABLE QUANTITIES and now I can\u2019t get any. I couldn\u2019t find the Kleenex I wanted yesterday. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to get aloe vera gel due to hand sanitizer DIYers. I was buying it to treat a damn sunburn. Fortunately I had no trouble finding what I wanted, but they definitely weren\u2019t well stocked. I might need to go grab toilet paper just to ensure we have some when we actually run out. Tl;dr people need to wash their hands and chill out.",

For some examples, there are people who need things like Clorox wipes or baby wipes because they have a newborn or live with an elderly person, therefore higher need to wipe things down. The rest of us can use normal soap and a cloth. There are people who need face masks and hand sanitizer more urgently because they\u2019re more susceptible to disease than the rest of us. \n\nFor gods sake just buy some hand soap and wash your hands! Better yet, buy the bars of soap because they last longer and use less plastic than the bottles of soap. A hygiene habit you should already have. Refrain from touching your face. And if it\u2019s cold enough to wear long sleeves where you live, just open door handles and such with your sleeves, don\u2019t buy out all of the rubber gloves. Remember to wipe off your phone with some phone or eye glass cleaner. Eat healthy and drink lots of water to keep your immunities up. \n\nAnd finally, corona is a viral form of pneumonia and does not make you shit like a dragon. So stop stockpiling on toilet paper!",

If I, an immunocompromised person don\u2019t need to stockpile on like 50+ rolls of toilet paper then neither do you. You know how I prepared today as Madrid is going into mini quarantine for the next 15 days? I bought pasta, tortillas, some snacks, 1 pack of soap, 1 surface cleaner, and a couple boxes of risotto and stock cubes. I got just the basics so for the next 15 days so I can avoid going outside to protect myself and make sure I\u2019m okay. You don\u2019t need to hoard shit, lets face it people who are stockpiling probably won\u2019t stay inside 24/7 like they should and will just do whatever. I know people who have hoarded goods but have gone out clubbing and into public places on the same day. Equal distribution, I don\u2019t get why people think they need all this stuff that I see in videos and hear people say they\u2019re bluk buying? You know what\u2019ll protect you more than all that toilet paper? Washing your hands regularly, not touching your face and DONT FUCKING COUGH ON PEOPLE I SWEAR TO GOD EVEN AS A JOKE ITS GROSS AND YOURE AN ASS IF YOU DONT COVER YOUR MOUTH PERIOD. Also this goes for 24/7 without the COVID-19. Like was I just raised weird? Cause I was always taught it was RUDE to cough or sneeze into your hand or not covering it and so you had to do it into a tissue or your elbow and turn away from people because otherwise that\u2019s rude???? Am I the only one taught this cause I had 4 people cough literally open mouth at me on the bus last week and if I die cause of idiots not knowing proper etiquette I\u2019ll be pissed as hell. Thanks for coming to my ted talk and I 100% agree with you. And people who are inflating prices and taking advantage of this horrible situation are scumbags and it just makes me sad that this is how humanity reacts.",

Which was followed by trips to 6 separate stores, because everyone is sold out.\n\nI swear to god if I get it and die (literal possibility) I swear I will spend the rest of my eternal rest haunting every mother f*cker I can find who stockpiled in my town.",

The only people who have died are people who have weak immune systems.  \n\n\nAnd I'm not saying I'm safe as I have a very weak immune system, I was and always have been a very sickly person.",

I was at a 24 hour Walmart at 11 PM when they were restocking the shelves.\n\nThe hand sanitizer section was empty and an employee came to stock it. She placed 5 boxes (each box had 8 3-ounce sanitizer bottles) and a girl just picked up all 5 boxes and put them immediately into her cart.\n\nAsked her for 2 bottles (which I wanted just because I have to fly to California for work) and thankfully she did give. But I can't imagine why someone would need that many bottles. A) it is not a substitute for hand washing and B) if everyone is not able to protect themself, then you're not safe either.",

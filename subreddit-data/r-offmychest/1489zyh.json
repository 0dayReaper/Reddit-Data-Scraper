    "postText": "He cheated on me, all his friends ignore me like I don't exist. I still checked his profile on incognito mode to see if he is miserable without me. To my surprise, I see that he is following around 30+ more people since last time! Since he's a cheater, I'm sure its all girls he's lusting and thirsting after. He gained around 20+ followers too. Probably girls he's talking to. I can't see who he followed because its a private profile. He used to tell me he'll never date or marry etc. Bullshit!! Looks like he is living his best life while I am still miserable. I don't miss him, its just I'm not talking to men. I don't even want to. I want to earn good money. He ruined my life and my body. I had two abortions with this cheater. Looks like he is living his best life. I spoke to one of his friends recently and the friend said, he's totally vanished. I don't think so! He's talking to the women on other platforms most probably.  I am shocked! I hate myself. I shouldn't have checked his page from incognito mode. He has the grit to change but I don't  ??? I'm sulking while he is improving to be a better version of himself? Please tell me cheaters never change!!!!!!!",

It's missed cos it went to blocked calls. We have blocked each other everywhere. He didn't unblock me on any social yet called. He's playing mind games with me it seems?",

Go for it ! Drawing ? Show your talent ! Writing poem ? Sing with the words ! And at the end, you\u2019ll be once again, proud of yourself to overcome once again, something horrible, something, while you are reading me, you are currently thinking it\u2019s pretty difficult to do, it\u2019s though to pass, but the important thing, it\u2019s patience. Don\u2019t think about how long it\u2019s gonna take for you to forget it, think about the present, breath and do, don\u2019t procrastinate but take your time, do what can help you to overcome this, just remember, patience and forget it.",

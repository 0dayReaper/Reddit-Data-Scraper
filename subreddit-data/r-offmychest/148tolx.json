    "postText": "Not sure if this is the right place to post but hi, 23f and I just found out im pregnant today. Been with my SO (21m) for 3 years and I don\u2019t know what to do. I have no one to talk to and I am looking for people to talk with. I am not even sure we are ready to bring a new life into this world. we are both so conflicted. as the saying goes, we never believed it would happen to us and it did. i am even considering abortion but the guilt and shame would eat me alive. I am thankful we live in a state that doesn\u2019t have a strict abortion law yet. i have always wanted a baby but the reality that we don\u2019t have set careers and im in college and money struggles that would come along the way is also eating at me. I cant even tell my family, i know they would be so disappointed because were still young. I fully believe my SO doesn\u2019t want a baby right now but he doesn\u2019t want to make me regret the decision we make. I lost my mom at a young age and id give anything to talk to her about it now. Anyone have any advice or helpful things to say?",

            "comment": "I'd like to make a point I haven't seen anyone make yet. You and your boyfriend are both very young and this isn't planned. You said he doesn't want a baby right now. It is very likely that you guys will break up if you go through with the pregnancy. He might get some amount of custody, or he might not want any, he may or may not pay child support. This will be the hardest thing you ever do and if you aren't both 100% in, it's very likely you will break up. Consider what life will be like as a young single mom.\n\nEdited typo \"long\" to \"young\"",

Nothing changes, you have time to live your life, get stability, save money, find a place to live, etc. If you want a child later you can have one. If you have the child, everything changes... and you cannot go back.",

Whether it be because it ruined their relationship or because they weren't financially prepared for it and it ruined their own life as well as put their child on a path of a less successful life or at least childhood. As this person already stated, having a child is an 18 year commitment. You're not ready based on how you're feeling right now. You should be confident when making this kind of commitment. I know you're scared but I'm sure things will be ok, just take some time and listen to the advice and be real with your partner.",

My only pregnancy after my daughter resulted in a miscarriage. It was awful.\n\nOP, I don't know why this commenter was downvoted, but I know first hand it's true. If you dont want or feel ready to keep the baby, it's understandable at your age, financial, and relationship position. There's so much to consider,  including if having children were must haves in your future plans.\n\nWhatever you do, everything will be OK. Good luck!",

            "comment": "It seems like you would benefit by speaking to someone at Planned Parenthood.  They have these conversations all the time about options and things to consider.  \n\nI mentor young adults in various settings. Planned Parenthood has been a great resource for many of them. They are _not_ primarily in existence based on performing abortions; they are there for sexual health and provide all sorts of related services for all genders and sexual orientation. \n\nAs a parent, I want to encourage you to speak to your (and he to his) parents/family for support. I certainly would not shame you and would be happy you had come to me for support. \n\nYou know your parents best, of course. Some might not be gracious, but I believe most would. \n\nGather information and support one another. It is a big choice for which there is not a \"right\" answer, just the best decision for you after weighing the options and your life situation. \n\nBest to you and know you are not alone. \ud83e\udd17",

            "comment": "I'm probably going to get down voted for this. But I have to speak my piece anyway.\n\nI'm not going to tell you NOT to get an abortion. It's your life and your body; all I want is for you to make the decision that causes you the least amount of pain. Only you know what that decision is. \n\nSo many people see abortion as a quick fix, an end-all to your problems. And it may be that way for some people, but for others, not so much. I know one person who got an abortion over a decade ago who is still dealing with grief, regret, and remorse. And I know another who also got an abortion who doesn't regret it in the slightest. People have different viewpoints, and that's okay. \n\nBut you shouldn't get an abortion if you're not 100 percent on board with it. Don't let anyone (your bf, your friends, strangers on Reddit) pressure you to get one if it's not something you completely want. Likewise, the reverse is true; don't let anyone pressure you into keeping a child that you don't want. \n\nYou have several choices in front of you, and unfortunately none of them are going to be easy or pain-free. Each choice has drawbacks and advantages. If you decide to have an abortion, you can go through with it knowing it was the best choice before you at the time. And if you decide to keep the baby, there are resources you can draw on to help you both. It'll be tough, I'm not going to lie or sugarcoat it. But if that's what you decide to do, then you can make it work.\n\nI wish you all the best, and I'm really sorry you're in this position.",

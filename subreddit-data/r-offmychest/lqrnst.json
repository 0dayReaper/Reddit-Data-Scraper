But good job brainwashing half the fuckin country to make us think that that's the only way that society can run and the only way that people deserve benefits and health insurance. Its honestly impressive how most people hate work and realize it's ridiculous to dedicate 5 days a week to your job, leaving yourself 2 days a week to care for yourself or do what you want. From the bottom of my heart and with passion, go fuck yourselves.",

They could have group 1 work 4 hours a day and then the next shift comes in for the next 4 hours. Less people unemployed and the 40 hours worth of work the company wants still gets done.\n\nEdit to all the people talking about lower wages:  wages would need to stay the same. Actually, be higher to reflect the rising cost of living. Most places keep their offices understaffed anyway to cut costs (referencing bigger corporations here, if my other replies havent clued you in yet. Smaller business might have to use a different model). So yes they will need to spend more on payroll. Many of these companies are making billions anyway, they can afford it. But of some of y\u2019all just wanna make excuses. Why won\u2019t I think of the poor CEOs??  :\u2019(\n\nAnyways...this was literally just an idea that I pulled out my ass in 2 seconds just to think of a way that busier jobs could cut hours and still have the same productivity and some of you just can\u2019t wrap your minds around the idea of less work. Lol. The 40 hour work week is a concept we made up, not some scientific law, so if we made that work for us we can make a different schedule work too. Whether it\u2019s 4x5 or 8x4.",

We\u2019re on a 2 days in the office/3 days at home schedule and it\u2019s the perfect balance. Keeps my mental health in check and the weeks don\u2019t drag on nearly as much. \n\nThe UK is definitely lucky they give their employees more time, but honestly not even 6 weeks is enough in my opinion. My job requires MAYBE 15-20 actual hours of work each week depending on how busy we are. That\u2019s it. The rest of the time is either down time or I just have no work to do. I understand not every job is like this, but a lot of them are. Especially office jobs.",

I worked myself to the bone doing 70+ hours a week and I just stepped down to a lower position as I was exhausted. I was working till 3am and getting up 6am. I missed my children so much so I stepped down to have less hours and more time with my children. It had helped my mental health alot. I feel sorry for you guys cause that is absolutely fucking shit for you. I would say I hope it improves for you but it doesn't seem like they will make any changes anytime soon!",

So somehow, people are supposed to work the same hours if not more to barely afford renting (not owning) and complete cooking, cleaning, etc in their off hours that used to be managed by an entire other person all week.\n\nAnd they wonder why younger people are tired all the time, barely have productive hobbies, are moving back home, and not having kids.",

There are some job sectors where a shorter workweek might be a solution, because the overall goal is productivity. But for others, like the service sector, the overall goal is to have enough manpower present and available to assist customers throughout the hours of operation. If they were to cut the 40 hour work week, they would have to either A) hire more people or B) cut their hours of operation.\n\nA lot of these places (for example, a customer assistance call center or a fast food restaurant) are already chronically understaffed and busy from open to close. Proper staffing is rare because no one wants to work there long term. Hours of operation are pretty much non-negotiable because consumer demand tends to be round-the-clock in the US (you ever seen the Starbucks drive thru at 10pm? It\u2019s ridiculous).\n\nIt\u2019s good to discuss the idea of work culture reform, but I think a lot of people fail to recognize that if it gets applied universally, they will not enjoy the same conveniences that our current system of always-open businesses allows us. That might mean not being able to get a meal at an irregular time of day. That might mean you have to wait a few days to contact tech support about your computer. This is how things tend to be in a lot of European countries and it drives Americans nuts. I don\u2019t think we realize how accustomed we are to instant gratification, or how the conveniences of our society come at a high labor price.",

I think the root of all (American) evil is that we never left Puritanism. We still basically believe that work is holy and that if you're rich, you've won God's love. If you're poor, it must be because you weren't working hard enough. And then we got into a pissing contest with Russia, started focusing on GDP to the detriment of everything else, and now? We force people to work more and more because their work is worth less and less due to things like automation...and in order to cope, most people lean right into it. I think UBI is a good way to contest the reality of this mindset, because it'll give people the space to think that maybe, just maybe, this sort of live-to-work mentality isn't right...and then maybe it'll let them think about politics and how to approach leadership in this country.\n\nBut that's just my opinion, and tbh it's really just the first step of a long, long road.",

We give most of our wealth and power to them and what do we get in return? A dying planet. This is what capitalism is, because when capital is privately owned it always leads to the formation of a ruling class.\n\nConcerning communism, I think its important to recognize that 20th century authoritarian vanguardist communism isn't the only form of communism, and it's not the only form of anti-capitalist resistance. Using the Soviet Union as a reference point for communism is like using Weimar Germany as a reference point for democracy. And another thing to keep in mind is that people have only been trying to solve the problem of class hierarchy specifically for a couple hundred years. Class hierarchy has existed (and consistently produced horror) for about 8,000 years. It makes sense that our first attempts would be deeply flawed.\n\nAnyways, the important thing is that we resolve the fundamental question: Should society be dominated by a ruling class, or not? There isn't a middle ground on that question. Should we learn from past mistakes, or simply wait until the investors and managers and owners reduce the Earth to an inanimate husk? They would rather obliterate the biosphere, than give up their positions of extreme power and wealth.",

The reason so many people are miserable is because they don\u2019t feel like they have a choice in anything.  They\u2019re told what to do &amp; how to do it at work &amp; if they don\u2019t, they risk becoming homeless or starving.  Most jobs aren\u2019t required to pay livable wages so you end up with a majority of people, even couples, spending most of their lives working just to survive.  Nothing extra for a fancy dinner occasionally, no time or money for a vacation, and if an emergency requiring more than $400 were to occur, it\u2019d put most of them in debt, if they weren\u2019t already.\n\nCapitalism only works when people have capital to spend &amp; that\u2019s been dwindling for 40 years straight.  So unless we integrate some new ideas into this archaic system, this shit is never gonna get better.",

Before then, employers could basically work people to death and, in extreme cases, even do that to children. I do agree that it is definitely not necessary and a shorter work week needs to be normalized, but it's important to note the 40 hour week is a major improvement to the historical alternative.",

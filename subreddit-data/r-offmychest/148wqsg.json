    "postText": "I (16f) had a panic attack after driving with my dad. So what happened before the actual attack I went on a drive with my dad (I am learning to drive so he has to be with me). Everything was fine until i was by my house. It\u2019d be too confusing and long to explain every detail but long story short I thought he told me to pull over so he can park but he wanted me too.(Side note: my dad has a harsh tone of voice so when he tells you something it sounds like he\u2019s yelling, but he can\u2019t seem to see that).  I was getting really confused because he kept \u201cyelling\u201d at me. The situation escalated and I ended up crying because I was overwhelmed and confused. I ended up parking but I broke into sobs when I stopped the car because he was still \u201cyelling\u201d. He did not stop once I stopped the car and because of that I started hyperventilating and he hit me so I ran out of the car and into the house and by that time I was going into a panic attack(I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the proper term, i\u2019ve never had one before). My mom is in the medical field so she calmed me. After I calmed down she talked to me, long story short she told me she didn\u2019t want to be the mom that sugar coats stuff and my confusion should be a behavior I should stop. (Side note: during the whole convo my dad was mad at me and said he\u2019d never take me driving again).She also said that she wants me, her, and my dad to have a conversation on what to do in the future. Typing this right now I don\u2019t want to have a conversation with them anymore I don\u2019t feel supported by them I just want them to forget that it even happened I keep apologizing but I don\u2019t know why. If the conversation does end up happening i\u2019ll update if people are interested. Thank you for reading",

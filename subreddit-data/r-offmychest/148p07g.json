    "postText": "About 10 years ago, when I was just out of highschool, I signed up for a hookup site. I never had much luck talking to women in person, thought maybe meeting online would be different. I actually wind up matching with a couple, saying they want someone to impregnate her. Thinking it was just a breeding fetish, and being a dumb teenager, I agreed to it.\n\nI first met up with them, and they explained they were serious; he was shooting blanks, and they needed a sperm donor, but treatments were too painful and expensive for them. Being young and dumb, I agreed to be part of it. I started visiting them regularly (twice a week) and having sex with her. He'd usually stay in the room with her, but wouldn't be participating. The sex wasn't for pleasure, and it was pretty mechanical, but I was a virgin and thought it was great anyways. I'd also somewhat hang out with them. We'd play card games, video games, or just hang out in the yard throwing a ball around and shooting the shit.\n\nAfter two months of trying, she got pregnant. After that, it was agreed that I would have no parental rights, and I wouldn't bother them about her if it wasn't urgent. In exchange, they would never come after me for financial assistance. I go on my way in life, and they go on theirs. 7 months later, a baby girl was born whose name I don't know, and will never know. My brother and his wife just announced they are having a baby yesterday at a family gathering, and it got me thinking about all of it.\n\nI have a kid.\n\nA kid that doesn't know me.\n\nA kid that never will know me.\n\nA kid that will never know my parents as grandparents, or my brother as her uncle.\n\nI've missed out on 10 years with a kid, and will continue to miss out the rest of their life.\n\nI will absolutely never make first contact. I've held my word; the only time I reached out to the mother was to let her know that I was found to have a mild inheritable disease, so just something to keep an eye on incase she got it from me. And they've held to theirs; I gave them a special email to contact me on if they need anything, and I still check it once a week, just in case, but they haven't reached out yet.\n\nI don't know what they told her. Maybe they just went with the simplest lie, and that he is the father. Maybe that her dad is not her biological father, and that I am a deadbeat, or that I died. I don't want to disrupt whatever they told her, that would be needlessly cruel. Besides, I'd be a shit dad.\n\nIt's just something I think about from time to time. It is also why I adamantly won't take a DNA test; god forbid we get linked somehow online. How the hell would I explain it to my family? I guess I could just tell them it was part of a threesome, and leave out the part where we did it on purpose, but I would really rather it never comes up.",

You gave these people a family, that's one of the greatest gifts you could ever give a person.\n\nThere are thousands and thousands of sperm donors out there, and that includes you. The only difference between you and the rest of them is the method in which the sperm was delivered to the mother. You gave this couple the sperm they needed to start a family and had a great time in the process. Sounds like a win-win to me.\n\nAnd as for your biological daughter, she has two parents that care for her and really wanted her in the world. That's what every child can only hope for. I'm sure her parents told her that her biological father was a sperm donor because that is the truth.",

A couple you knew asked for help conceiving, you helped with your genetic contribution. Not that you even owe that much explanation to anyone ever. But there is zero shame in you helping two wonderful people have a child. It sounds like he or she is very loved, and it doesn't get better than that. Plus you are able to reach out to give a medical update, they can reach out to you if needed. And both of you have stuck to your agreements. Win win.\n\nBesides, a lie like that would end up coming out, you'd likely be pushed by family to demand partial custody, etc. It would just be messy. Far easier to give a short version of the truth and shut anyone down who wants to pry or be involved, it's not any of their business, only yours.",

Like you said you don't wanna be involved cause you're afraid it'll mess her up even though it probably won't but make a plan of what you're going to do if she contacts you. What are you gonna tell her, will you introduce her to your parents and brother if she wants to meet her biological family, will you be in her life if she wants you to. It's better to fully know whether you will be in her life before you meet her than leading her on for 3 months and telling her you won't contact her again and leaving her heartbroken. IMO if she wants you in her life you should be in her life.",

She knew they all lived in the same city. She constantly worried about accidentally meeting or having sex with her own siblings or father. What you did not only affects you, it also affects the child forever. Because even if they didn't tell her, she will know deep down she is not  who she thinks is her real mom and dad. My friend also figured it out. She knew she was adopted, so to speak. It's just all,so I messed up.",

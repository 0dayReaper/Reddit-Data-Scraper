    "postText": "I (Male 22) fell in love with my gym bro (Male 24). Problem being, I thought I was straight.\n\nThis all started a few months ago, I noticed this guy at my gym and I knew something was immediately off. I was like nervous to even look at him, but I decided to get rid of that nervousness and just talk to him. He was actually really nice and funny and we quickly became buddies. Then about two weeks later my girlfriend broke up with me. I told him that and we had a heart to heart where he casually came out as gay. But that initial offness that I felt when I first saw him didn\u2019t go away, and I quickly started to piece together that it was the same feeling I get when I look at a really pretty girl. \n\nAnd over the months it\u2019s been increasingly hard to be near him because he\u2019s just so\u2026gorgeous I guess. Whenever I go to sleep, I just imagine him there snuggled up to me. I just wanna text him all the time\u2026and I just wanna kiss him so bad. I guess this is me coming out as bi\u2026I met a beautiful guy at the gym and we became best friends, I love his personality, he makes me laugh nonstop, and ngl he\u2019s mad thick. I wanna ask him out so bad\n\n**Update**: at the gym rn, we\u2019re gonna do our sets and when we leave ima walk him to his car and tell him. Thanks for the courage everyone!\n\n**update 2**: I\u2019m fucking crying in my car rn holy shit. He said yes. So I walked him to his car and I told him. And bruh\u2026the way I couldn\u2019t speak lmao I was so nervous. But basically, he said he kinda thought I was into him cause \u201cI can only catch you respectfully staring at my butt so many times before it\u2019s a little sus\u201d. But I told him that I\u2019m bi\u2026and we\u2019re going on a date Friday. But like bruh\u2026he looked so flustered and cute when I told him\u2026he had the prettiest smile lmao. And for the people saying stuff about my vocab and texting\u2026I\u2019m a history major, not smart\u2026my vocab consists of \u201cI guess\u201d, \u201clike\u201d, \u201cidk\u201d, \u201cbruh\u201d, and \u201cfucking\u201d. But anyways\u2026I guess we\u2019re a little more than just gym bros now\u2026I seriously couldn\u2019t have done this if this didn\u2019t get so much random ass support lmao. Anyways\u2026I\u2019m fucking shaking\u2026I actually did it\u2026bruh I love him so much\u2026so so so fucking much. Thank you for the support!\n\n**Update 3**: https://twitter.com/lilstupidwhore/status/1521696754567163904?s=21&amp;t=qP69rlQ9PaNI4GPZbmM7IA\n\n**Update 4**: Hey there, I know I\u2019ve been gone for a long ass time lmao. But I had to take a social media break just because like\u2026I was just really overwhelmed I guess with all the attention this post got. Some of you were asking about update 3, it was just me talking on Twitter about the insecure assholes calling me a woman for sharing emotions lmao. I deleted it cause I felt a bit embarrassed having my voice on the internet lmao\u2026I\u2019m too introverted for that shit. But I will be making occasional updates on my Twitter I guess. As for how me and my man are doing\u2026it\u2019s better than I could\u2019ve asked for\u2026I know we haven\u2019t been together super long I guess\u2026but\u2026he just like\u2026idk\u2026I\u2019ve just never felt more appreciated by someone\u2026so yeah, he\u2019s got me wrapped around his finger hella hard lmao. But I think I\u2019m just gonna ultimately log out of this Reddit account but still keep the post up for you guys\u2026just know my Twitter is where I\u2019ll be making updates occasionally.",

I never acted on it, and then a couple years later I got another crush. Eventually I realized that while most of the time in more into men, there are also some women that I'm highly attracted to!\n\nI actually don't really identifying with the term \"bisexual\" either because it implies too much of a duality and I think I'm more attracted to specific types of personalities rather than a specific sex.\n\nAnd sometimes putting a label on it too soon adds too much pressure that doesn't need to be there.

Figured that out at the end of high-school where I was seriously into one of my male friends. Was too embarrassed at the time to ever say anything despite him being gay. Then in 2015 (or around then), 2 years after graduating, he hung himself on new years eve. I hadn't spoken much to him the year prior since we lived far away at that point for school. I always regret never saying anything to him or reaching out during the last year, neither I or my other friends knew he was struggling so much. I am happily married to a woman now but I still think about him all the time, he was one of the kindest people I have known. RIP David",

Self-acceptance is so difficult, and I just think it's so amazing how this all worked out for you both. Speaking as a gay dude, it takes so long and so much support (whether from yourself or others) to be comfortable being yourself. Stories like this are part of the reason I'm working to become a therapist focused on the LGBTQ+ community, it's heartwarming and you're being true to yourself, and the sheer amount of happiness in your post says more than what words could ever convey, and I want to see that for every person who may be struggling with their own identity, for them to be truly happy.

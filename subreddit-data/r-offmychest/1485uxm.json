    "postText": "I know for a lot of people, the unconscious decision to hide certain aspects of your life from friends, from family, from the world is not always a predetermined course of action.  Often times it is innate in the way people are raised.  However, I wasn't raised with that (very socially awkward most of my life) and never really had the luxury of hiding much about myself due to some medical issues.  If I didn't tell a few people about it and something happened, I would have been carted out in an ambulance I couldn't afford.  Also, having medical issues and consistent pain doesn't leave me with a lot of brain space to think of who to tell what and why and how.  I did my best but at the end of the day it doesn't matter.  Even if people in your life know about your medical issues ahead of time and then you have to  deal with it, it is too much.  They already have their lives, their worries, and their insecurities to deal with and have no more space for anyone else.  So, I have decided to join the rest of you that I see out and about fake smiling at your job, putting on an act around your family, and hiding the truth from the people you say you love the most and give into the facade.  I can't be myself anymore because what I do actually means nothing but if I slip one time and say something off it is held onto and used against me.  I have tried being myself around friends, family, coworkers, and spouses.  What I can gather from all of this is it doesn't matter how much I made you laugh or what I did for you.  What mattered was what I said and sometimes the very thing that made you laugh earlier is now something to use against me because you want to be offended.  No more jokes or quirky sense of humor.  No more sharing my favorite videos.  No more memes and crazy conversations or deep questions which no one else bothers to ask cause they don't care to notice.  I'm done being my unique self and will now do what you all do.  It sucks but it is the only option I have left.  ",

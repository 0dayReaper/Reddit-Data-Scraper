    "postText": "I'm M(23) and I've got rejected before by the maritime school I enrolled in because I found out that I've been diagnosed by chronic heapatitis B which I inherited from my mom. An addition to that, I've also been bullied because i also acquired another inborn disability which is exotropia in which my eyes turn outwards on its own and I've been bullied a lot because of that.\n\nNow, my dream to become a seafarer is no longer possible and I've taken another course. I'm really depressed and overthinking a lot if I'll be able to even land a good job or if there will be someone who will love me because of my eyes. I try to see the good things in me like I'm performing pretty good academically and people say that i got the looks and the height but again my eye turning outwards can be a massive turn off for someone. My past 3 exes didnt let me feel that they were bothered by my eye but I myself is bothered with it. Bottom line is, it might be hard for me to secure a job because of my chronic illness and it might be hard to even have a relationship because of my disability. \n\nFeel free to give advices or comments but I'm just letting it off my chest. Thanks everyone and stay safe. You are loved.",

    "postText": "I had been going out with a girl from dating app for about 4 dates when someone that I hadn\u2019t talked to in about a year suddenly texted me. Basically asked me If I had moved on since we kinda flirted but it never went anywhere. She was my crush from high school from 7 years ago. She moved away after my sophomore year. I thought I moved on but then when I saw her text I was happy. I agreed to drive 300 miles to see her again. At this point I didn\u2019t know who I liked more. The friend from high school or the one from the dating app. They were both great. We had good conversations over text. I actually thought I would make the drive see that I don\u2019t like her as much as I did before and I would go back home to the girl from dating app. Instead I left but not before I stuck my tongue in her mouth as a goodbye and a new title as her boyfriend. That was yesterday. Today I told the girl from the dating app that i no longer saw her as possible romantic partner and we agreed to be friends. I crushed her. She already had insecurities and trust issues so I know I crushed her. I did this over text because she didn\u2019t want me to do it over the phone and our work schedules make it so we could only see each other once a week. I did this during my lunch break. Now I got out of work into my car and started crying my eyes out. I know I crushed her. I know either way I would make one of them very happy and the other one would have been crushed. I fucking chose to crush the one with anxiety, depression, and trust issues. I\u2019ve never cried so hard in my life. Does this mean I chose wrong? Does this mean I fucked up. What if I chose the other way. Would I cry too? I don\u2019t know. All I know is that I did it. And I have to live with the fact that I chose the girl that has loved me since we were in high school but couldn\u2019t date because I was scared of long distance and decided to break what I had with the girl who trusted me with her darkest thoughts and feelings but is now wondering why she wasn\u2019t good enough. She compared herself to \u201c the fish at the pet store that everyone looks at but nobody wants\u201d. I win either way. I lose either way.",

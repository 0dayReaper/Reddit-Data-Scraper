    "postText": "To provide a bit more context my parents have been divorced since I was 5 and I mainly stay with my mum because my dad works full time.\n\nI've had some issues with my father in the past but I thought we had moved past them until a few months ago.\n\nI recently came out as trans (FTM) and my dad has had a hard time accepting it. He is using my chosen name but refuses to use my pronouns and often makes hurtful and insensitive comments.\n\nHe's also made comments about me and my body in the past that have led to quite a few issues with my self esteem.\n\nWe've had plenty of conversations about it and I've given him so many chances to admit he was wrong and apologize for some of the things he said to me but he won't.\n\nIn the past few weeks he has stopped making comments about me being trans but has instead moved on to my weight. I've always been slightly overweight and have struggled with an ED in the past so I find these comments really upsetting.\n\nMy mum is a lot more supportive of me but she doesn't know the full situation and I'm worried that she would force me to see my dad.\n\nI wish I could cut him off completely but I don't know if I can or if I should as I'm worried it might put me in danger.",

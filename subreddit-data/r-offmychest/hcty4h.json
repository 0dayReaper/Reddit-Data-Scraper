Even in stores a lot of people working aren't wearing masks??? Like what the hell is happening? WE ARE STILL IN A PANDEMIC NO? Also I'm a little scared for my safety if I'm being completely honest, I get so many judgemental stares and the truck people my friend hangs out with post the most propoganda shit about covid. I'm telling you, it's wild living in a small rural town and having an opinion other than people.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for being so supportive &lt;3",

I can't wrap my mind around it at all. \n\nHow can anyone continue believing it's political? Even after they know it's a real thing, a dangerous thing to people they know? But they still decide to ignore it and put 'faith' in the words of the political party they belong to that said it's a 'hoax by the Democrats to make Trump look bad' - which in itself makes no sense seeing as this is happening *world wide* FFS! It's a global pandemic!\n\nI just cannot handle that people are this stubbornly ignorant. It wouldn't be so horrible if it wasn't literally risking people's lives - the ignorant included. \n\nAnd seriously - wearing a mask is nothing. It's temporary. And for most people, it's only for short increments of time and only in certain situations they most likely don't even *have* to be in if it's really *that* awful for them. And for those rare occurrences where they do 'have' to be somewhere and wear a mask - again, it's a short increment of time out of all the hours of their life they are - thankfully - still alive to live. Is it really that difficult or horrible to show the smallest bit of consideration for other people's well-being?\n\nEven *worse* than not giving a shit yourself - is fucking with people who do. The absolute minimal shred of courtesy you could give is just mind your own business. That's it. Don't fuck with people who do care. Don't fuck with people who are simply taking the health of themselves, their family, their friends and even your stubborn ass into consideration and wearing a mask 'just in case'. How fucked up do you really have to be that you can't even manage that? It takes less energy to just live your own life than it does to fuck with someone else's. Yet wearing a damn mask is *that* triggering? \n\nI literally just can't anymore with this shit.",

June and July are usually our biggest seasons. We have already broken some company records for amount of business - all time. (~30 yrs)\n\nAs a rough estimate, from May 1st to today the amount of customers who maintain social distancing and/or wear masks has been very steady at about 10%. \n\nThis virus ceased to exist the moment the stores opened, and it's been full on \"Hell yeah, vacation time!\" for everyone. \n\n---\n\nEven us employees are more lax than we should be. It's not because we are concerned - but rather because we have absolutely given up hope. Counting on the quarantine having given the hospitals time as planned so that *when* our at risk loved ones get sick they're'll be a hospital bed available for them.\n\nIt's been very difficult the past few weeks because we lost almost half our staff. They didn't come back from being laid-off - the pay was simply no longer worth the risk. With 90% of our customers being tourists, vacationers, and travelers - none of which with even a hint of concern - I can not fault them. \n\nWe have not struggled to find new hires, as people have found themselves desperate for work even it it is lowpay and high risk. The difficulty of going in to a record busy season with a team of trainees led to a second wave of resignations. \n\nHonestly, I think everyone is kind of glad work is so difficult. Less time to focus on how totally in despair we all are regarding the situation. There's definitely a \"don't talk about it\" vibe. \n\nWe are all really just counting on luck to keep ourselves safe at this point. No one believes our personal safety measures are sufficient enough to protect us.",

I\u2019m in A city where it seems like a lot of people are social distancing still, wearing masks etc while a large part of the population are getting sloppy, bored and sitting shoulder to shoulder in bars, maskless. At least if all people are wearing masks to stores etc you can feel safe about it. I\u2019ve called people out on not wearing masks inside because if you don\u2019t want to wear a mask outside, you do you, but inside you\u2019re really doing it for the protection of other people. This Atlantic article is the most helpful ones I\u2019ve found on the spread of covid and has helped me decide what I\u2019m willing to risk. \n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/how-will-we-ever-be-safe-inside/611953/\n\nSo the other week we had social distanced drinks outside where everyone brought their own snacks and drinks and sat a reasonable distance apart without masks. I allowed myself that because my husband had started to go crazy from lack of socialisation. However I did not go inside with anyone to use the bathroom. The store round the corner is off limits for me now because of the blaring air conditioning and their lack of mask enforcement. \n\nI\u2019m not a scientist or a doctor but I have a friend who works in the ER and she has said she\u2019s not joining any indoor gatherings until there\u2019s a vaccine. Groceries are delivered. I\u2019m following her lead because with the reopenings and people relaxing on the mask wearing I\u2019m afraid of the next phase of covid in the US. \n\nAnd here\u2019s another that has helped my husband and I decide what we are willing to risk (it\u2019s not a lot and we are in an area where it sounds like more people are open to taking protective measures so I don\u2019t blame you not wanting to venture outside).\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/23/861325631/from-camping-to-dining-out-heres-how-experts-rate-the-risks-of-14-summer-activit\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re going through this and I hope you and your family stay safe.",

The nearest medium sized town near me recently said masks are mandatory in all businesses and public areas, but I doubt it will be followed. In my office (which is in town, not where I live) I was asked \u201cDo you really think that\u2019s necessary to wear??\u201d It really blows my mind. Also, I don\u2019t know if other have experienced this, but it has become sort of a debate like pro-choice or something in my family. My mom asked me on the phone \u201cAre you one if those people who wears a mask when you go out?\u201d like she was asking if I like sugar in my coffee, but more pointedly. Absolute madness.",

My anxiety has been flaring so much these days, whether it\u2019s about the stares I know I\u2019m getting bc I\u2019m the only one in a mask or the heightened possibility of me getting sick or passing it on to my family bc other people aren\u2019t wearing masks or social distancing :&lt; just know that you\u2019re doing the right thing by protecting yourself, your family, and the people around you. we can\u2019t change how other people act or react, we can only control ourselves, and it sounds like you\u2019re doing what you can.",

            "comment": "i live in the deep south too, my dude. lots of people not taking this shit seriously. \nhowever the place i work at requires all employees to wear masks and keep a clean area. we\u2019re very careful, and i see a lot of customers (i work at a grocery store) wearing masks as well, especially the elderly and families with small children. makes me have a little faith in humanity. \n\nhowever a lot of other people think it\u2019s all bullshit and that there\u2019s nothing to worry about. but in the end, if they get affected, i suppose it\u2019ll be their own fault. i can\u2019t feel bad for them if they didn\u2019t even try. \n\nhope you and your mother stay safe and healthy &lt;3",

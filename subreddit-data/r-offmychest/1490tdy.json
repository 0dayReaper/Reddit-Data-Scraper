    "postText": "As the titles suggests I cannot get over my ex gf from two years ago. I came to this sub to just get everything off my chest. \n\nWe dated for a year and everything was perfect. At least to me. In the midst of our last argument she said how I had stopped making her happy. That broke. \n\nMay marked 2 full years of us being broken up. It\u2019s annoying because I want to move on. I\u2019ve tried. I dated a girl this year for 6 months but I ended things because I knew I was just not in love with her as much as she was with me. \n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t but I keep putting her on a pedestal that no other woman can come close to and it\u2019s fucking me up. It\u2019s even worse because I know she doesn\u2019t even think of me. We live 5 hours away now and absence makes the heart grow fonder or whatever but I figured after 2 years I\u2019d be over her. I have no clue what the actual fuck to do. She was everything to me but I found out she ended up hooking up with a mutual friend 2 months after our breakup and that hurt even more. \n\nBut yeah, just came to get all this shit out. Any advice is welcome.",

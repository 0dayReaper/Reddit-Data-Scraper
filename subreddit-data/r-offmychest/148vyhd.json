    "postText": "\r  \nI've never tried so hard to succeed at something and failed. Is it time to move on from this job?\r  \nI started working for a reputable national organization in the DC area a few months ago and was very excited about the work I would be doing. I knew it would be a challenge, as I would be transitioning into a more technical and analytical role, but I was completely invested and willing to try my best to succeed. Up until that point (last October when I started by new job), I had a relatively successful career that I was proud of. I even won a few staff recognition awards and was given bonuses at my previous job, all while I was enrolled as a full-time student in a quantitative/data focused masters program. I don't come from a privileged background, but I've worked hard my entire life to pay my way through university and be where I'm at now. Fast forward to my performance evaluation meeting with my \"new\" boss, I feel completely burnt out and exhausted, but the feedback i'm receiving is that I'm still not doing enough. I regularly work 10-12 hour days, just to get caught up on what feels like an impossible work load. I have 1 supervisor, but have to constantly work with some coworkers and meet deadlines that they have. They all have different processes and working styles, so I've had a hard time meeting their deadlines and expectations. Its also not uncommon for me to receive last minute requests, which throws my entire day off track. Since I started this job, 2 coworkers have left the team, and 1 of them started working at this org after I did and was only there for a total of 3 months. Another coworker recently shared that they had started seeing a mental health professional as a result of the pressure and stress from work. My boss thinks that my core issue is my time management and communication, but neither have EVER been an issue for me before. Even then, i've tried to find solutions to address these issues, but the workload just continues to increase. I feel like a failure and have lost all my motivation. I don't know if I should let go of this job and just start looking for something else. \r  \n\r  \nPart of me thinks its time for me to look for another job, but the other half wants to give it one last try to see if I can make it work. I know my pride could be clouding my judgement and making me want to try even harder to prove myself. I just don't know what to do. I''ve also wondered if this type of work environment is the standard in the East Coast/DC area and I should figure out how to adapt it if I want to work in this part of the country again. Or maybe im just not cut out for this type of work and shouldn't aim so high. \\*sigh\\* I've been carrying these feelings and thoughts for a while now. So thank you for allowing me vent and get this off my chest.",

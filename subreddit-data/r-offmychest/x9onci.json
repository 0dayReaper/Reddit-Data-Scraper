    "postText": "I need a little advise on the matter as I don't know what to do anymore. \n\n\nI was 21 when my fiance asked me to marry him. \n\nHe was the absolute light of my life. We had known each other since pre school, our family's are very close. \n\nHe would come and have dinner with us on a daily basis and vice versa. He doesn't have any siblings but I have 2 older sisters. Which is very important as he was also very close with them. \n\nWe grew up together. When we started dating, I don't think our parents stopped celebrating for weeks. \n\nHe helped me deal with a lot of my anxiety and even when I gained a little weight and my mother berated me saying he was going to leave me, he told her off and said he loved me for who I was, not for what I looked like, even though he claimed I was the most beautiful girl in the world to him. \n\nWe were only engaged for 6 months before the inncident.\n\nMy middle oldest sister, lets call her Nicky, was a very cold person, she never showed any affection, she only ever opened up to my fiance as she said she saw him as a brother and he also helped her through a lot of her dark times such as battling drug addictions and breaking the law. \n\nShe and I never saw eye to eye, I loved her dearly because she was my sister but didn't like her as a person. \n\nOut of the blue she tells me she wants to take me clubbing as we had never been together before and she felt bad that she was so distant to me. \n\nI agreed and that night we went out. \n\nClubbing wasn't really my style but once I had a few drinks, I loosened up a little and began having fun. \n\nThe night was going smoothly until Nicky spotted a guy across the room whom she claimed she wanted to \"climb like a tree\" She walked over to him and within a few minutes she was back and she had a sour expression on her face. \n\nI asked her what was up but she never said anything. \n\nI kept pressing because I didnt want our night to be ruined, she then told me the guy didn't want her number but he wanted mine instead. \n\nI told her he was a loser and there were plenty of guys around who would kill to be with a girl like her, she didn't budge though. \n\nShe told me she needed to use the restroom and then we would leave. \n\nI waited for other an hour, during this time I was sipping on a lot of different cocktails, I then started feeling really dizzy and lightheaded. \n\nI figured I'd just cab it home as I was certain Nicky had left. \n\nOn the way out though, I bumped into a friend of Nicky's whom she had briefly dated. \n\nHe asked me If I needed a hand to my car and I explained I was getting a cab  he said he was getting ready to leave and we could share one. I told him okay and we walked out of the club together and into the first cab we saw. \n\nI tried to find my phone in my purse but I felt myself getting dizzier and dizzier. \n\nI don't remember what happened next as I blacked out and the next morning I woke up on a hard sofa, my head pounding. \n\nWhen I came to, I realised I was in Nicky's friends house and my phone was sitting on the glass table in front of me, but it was flat. \n\nWhen he noticed I was awake he offered some tablets and water and explained that I had passed out in the cab and he didnt remember my parents address so he just picked me up and took me back here where he laid me on the sofa. \n\nI told him I needed to go home as my fiance would be worried. \n\nHe called a cab and I left. When I arrived at my parents house, my mother, father, Nicky, my fiance and his parents were all standing in the living room. \n\nI thought they were worried about me but the instant I opened my mouth my fiance asked how could I do this to him? \n\nI tried to explain that my phone went flat but he then went on screaming about how could I cheat on him. \n\nI was baffled. Why would he think that? I tried to explain the nights events but I kept getting cut off. \n\nNicky then chimed in and said I was a lying S and how could I be so heartless to a man who has been there for me through thick n thin. \n\nShe went on to say I kept flirting with random guys all night and then when she went to the bathroom, she saw me leave with her friend. \n\nI told her what had happened and she showed me photos on her phone where as we were leaving, his hand was on my back ushering me outside, yes the photo did look horrible and I was so drunk I didn't even realise his hand was on my back at all. \n\nMy fiance was so angry, he kept shouting and his mum and mine were both crying. \n\nI then asked Nicky to call her friend and he would confirm Nothing happened but when she called him, he told a completely different story. \n\nHe said I begged him to take me back to his and when he did, we slept together multiple times. \n\nI saw red and started crying and yelling at Nicky because I knew she had organised this whole thing to make me look bad.\n\nI begged my fiance to believe me, but he just shook his head and left. When everyone had cleared out, my mother slapped me across the face and told me to get out. \n\nI left and went to a friends house where I stayed for a few nights. During those nights I called my fiance crying and pleading with him to believe me that nothing happened but it all fell on deaf ears as he never returned any of my calls or texts. \n\nMy mum texted me and told me she was kicking me out and that she couldnt believe I would do such a thing and a lot of hurtful other slurs I don't think I could repeat here. \n\nShe didn't even give me time to get my things as she threw everything out. \n\nI was now homeless. None of my family would take me in, as they chose my fiance and mothers side. \n\nI was homeless and single in less than a day and a half, my entire world had been taken away because of Nicky's lies. \n\nNow for weeks I tried everything to get my fiance back and my family.\n\nThe limit for me though was when Christmas time had come and I went over to my mothers house to try and reconcile. I was sleeping from couch to couch during this time. \n\nWhen I got to my parents house, I knocked on the door but no one answered. My friend then called me and told me she just saw on facebook that my family were in another state celebrating Christmas and they had posted pictures online. \n\nEveryone was there, my sisters, parents, grandparents and even my fiance and his family. \n\nWhen I myself saw the photos, I couldn't stop crying as they all looked so happy. \n\nI cried for days and days before deciding to block them all. I even returned my engagement ring. \n\nMy friend knew someone a couple hours away who was looking for some help in his restaurant and he even had living arrangments above where he worked so I could get rent at a cheap price and work at the same time. \n\nI wanted to start over with my life as it hurt me that noone took my side and they all left me to fend for myself. \n\nI was able to move pretty quickly and was doing well, the apartment was tiny and I had to work 10+ hours almost every day, but I was able to save a lot of money. \n\nIm not living in the apartment anymore, I was able to rent a much nicer condo but I am still working at the restaurant as assistant manager. \n\nNow it has been roughly two years since I left and have not spoken to any of my family. I have no idea what is going with them until I got a knock on my door. \n\nIt was my ex fiance. I was shocked to say the least, all these feelings came rushing back and all I wanted to do was jump into his arms. \n\nBut then I remembered the pain I had felt and tried to slam the door in his face but he stopped it and asked that I let him explain. \n\nHe said that Nicky had gotten married and she had confessed that she lied about the situation because she had found someone she loved so much and realised what a horrible thing she had done. \n\nI asked him how he found me and he said my friend told him. \n\nMy entire family had been trying to get in touch with me and want to see me. \n\nI told him I needed time to see if I even wanted To have them in my life. \n\nHe left and I have been a mess since. \n\nI don't know what to do, I know I will never ever forgive Nicky, she could rot for all I cared but Its hard because my other family and fiance didn't know she was lying, but I also felt like they abandoned me too quickly without letting me explain my side. \n\nI don't know if I should forgive them. \n\nAny advice would be much helpful. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read.",

It\u2019s all well and good for them to be \u2018sorry\u2019 but they didn\u2019t have to completely reinvent themselves on their own the way you did.

I understand emotions can run high, but I bet he knew what kind of person the sister was if he literally helped her through a drug addiction and other issues (for clarity, being addicted to drugs isn't the problem, but the person that her sister is).  There's no way he's not familiar with the type of person she was and what type of friends she might have.  He deserves zero second chances.\n\nEdit:  I only mentioned her fiance, but all of this applies to her family as well.",

It would have proved you were drugged and hopefully shown there was no intercourse.\n\nAnd if it wasn\u2019t a setup, to think that your sister stood there and took pictures when someone took her drunk sister away? A true friend would have intervened, not recorded it. Anyone with half a brain could have seen from space that this was orchestrated. \n\nShe drugged you, left you alone then recorded her friend leading you away. She facilitated your assault! That\u2019s pure evil, she should also be in jail for that.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this happened to you and unless Nicky apologizes to you herself, I would have nothing to do with your monstrous family. Heck, even then I would leave them all in the past. What they did was unbelievably cruel.",

She deserves her life to be ruined, her husband probably things she is a good person when she is not. Everyone should abandon her just as they did to OP. I not only wouldn\u2019t let any of them in life again, but make them regret it someway. I understand her ex fianc\u00e9 had proof of the \u201cinfidelity\u201d but her family didn\u2019t even listen. Their daughter was homeless and they didn\u2019t care at all. If they want OP back it is only fair that the kick her sister out of their lives. There\u2019s even less excuses for her behavior than a supposed cheating accusation.",

Her family literally kicked her out onto the streets, spread rumors about her while she was homeless, and let her 'sister' take over the estate while she was struggling to rebuild her life. None of them checked in on her and offered support while she was struggling. Instead they spread her business to everyone that might have still been a part of her social life. They shunned her from the family based on lies. From how she tells it, it was all a ruse to get her out of the picture. It's like they cared more about the status her former engagement gave her rather than her. I mean, after she was kicked out, they went on vacation.She could have been dead in a ditch somewhere and not one of them would have known. After the fiance left, so did their pretend concern for her.\n\nIt's interesting that her ex and her indifferent, self serving family are checking in on her again now that she's out of the  sewers of society and doing better for herself. They used her for their own drama and now feign regret..and for what? It's fake. They didn't care when she was telling them she was being exploited. They helped hide it by kicking her out of the family and ignoring her. \n\nSo why would they care now that the sister has had an alleged change of heart? People like this family only care about appearances, not honesty or integrity. That's the whole reason why she was under their microscope in the first place.  It wasn't about her alleged failings because they've definitely done worse. It was about appearances. Her talking made them look bad so they got rid of her. That's not a family motivated by things like honor or morality.\n\nIf they want her back, it's for more of the same selfish shit show they put her through before. If she tries to reject them, they'll just make her feel guilty in order to manipulate her into doing what they want. The fact she even feels guilty after the hell they've put her through means they'll keep manipulating her until she truly stops caring or she leaves them behind forever.\n\nShe has to remember she had no voice or agency when she was in their household. They didn't suddenly learn respect after she left. It's likely they're just afraid she'll expose their secrets or collect some inheritance. Or perhaps they need another black sheep to point at for more drama. Some families only keep certain members around to use and abuse. The fact that she left means she has a chance to be free of their judgement and manipulating. How does she know that the second they invite her back into their lives she won't (once again) be ensnared in their web of pain?\n\nShe doesn't need to be their scapegoat anymore. Here's to leaving the ex and that family in hell where they belong.",

If you decide to never speak to any of them again, your family will vilify you for abandoning them. If you let them back into your life they\u2019ll continue to drain your energy for their own personal gains.\n\nYour sister didn\u2019t get kicked out of the family like you when she confessed, so obviously she can do no harm in their eyes; huge red flag!\n\nWhat she did to you was so much more egregious than what they were convinced you did. The fact that they still haven\u2019t personally attempted to reach out even after knowing the truth is all you need to know.\n\nThis is the ultimate betrayal, and betrayal cuts the deepest. You thought you had a loving family, fianc\u00e9, and soon to be In-laws.

However I\u2019m even more concerned that your family and your own S/O (at the time) did not believe you. Everyone makes mistakes, but him not hearing YOUR side of the story and taking another woman\u2019s word over yours is very disrespectful towards you. When your sister came clean, did your family cast her away? Do they know what she put you through? She drugged you! You are her SISTER!! That\u2019s some Malicious and psychopathic behavior if you ask me!! \n\nPlease please please remember OP, you shouldn\u2019t feel you have to take your family back just because they are blood relatives. Just because someone is related to you does not mean you have to tolerate their abusive behavior. Family is more than blood.\n\nAs for the guy, I would talk to him but tell him you\u2019re concerned about getting back together and express how you feel. You were a victim and he wouldn\u2019t even listen to your side of the story. That\u2019s no man. You deserve someone that\u2019s going to respect you no matter what rumor they hear about you. \n\nAnd I also agree with u/inevitable-okra-3229 \nEveryone should know what your sister did. But at this meeting ask that no one speaks until you\u2019re finished telling your side of the story.",

So so sorry. \n\nRegarding you fiance, I mean, I get how you feel about him and I get that it's hard, but I also understand that he really was lied to and he felt so hurt.\n\nBut regarding you familly, especially your mom, they are absolute shit. Even if it had happened; you did 't betray them but your fiance, I cannot for the life of me understand how cruel they were. I would still wish them dead. And now the question for your fiance is, does he get how terrible your fanilly acted? Did he got that in the moment, that the punishment was waaaay over the top, especially since they didn't even know if it was true? \nLike if he felt your fanilly was justified in shitting you out, just because he thought you hurt him, then he is also a piece of shit that should just rot. But I get how talking might give you closure, might just not.\n\nAnother point, you were a completely different person most likely before this happened. Life (and the most horrible sister on earth) were so cruel to you, I can imagine you also changed apart from forgiveness or not. Maybe you and fiance are also not compatible anymore.",

I know it's hard but please remember how they threw you away like trash, none of them deserve your kindness or forgiveness. If it were me I'd tell all of them one time how I felt and then go NC forever. Honey this isn't some minor issue, you were drugged, embarrassed, and abandoned by the people who were supposed to love you the most. The fact that your parents went two years without reaching out to you should tell you enough about how they feel about you. You're doing great, live your life without the negativity and drama of reconciling with them, especially since you have no intention of forgiving their golden child.",

It\u2019s possible you were raped. \n\nYou sister is a f*cking psycho. Pardon my language but she basically fed you to a wolf and blew up your life. And for what? She didn\u2019t even come to you herself to apologize.\n\nYour parents would even listen to anything you had to say. They raised you and should know you as a person. They should know to listen and trust you and they wouldn\u2019t even hear you out. Who does that to their own child? They behaved as though you were a stranger they didn\u2019t know by not even hearing you out and only listening to your sister. \n\nFurthermore, your parents threw you out like you were a piece of trash they couldn\u2019t be bothered with. They made you homeless because of their friendship with your ex fianc\u00e9\u2019s family. They chose that family over their own daughter. \n\nYour ex fianc\u00e9 listened to your sister\u2019s lies and believed them over you. Your relationship with him was not as strong as you believed if he was so easily swayed. Relationships are built on trust and he had none in you.\n\nThere is a saying that serves well here; when someone shows you who they truly are, believe them. You sister may have been manipulating things but your family and ex believed her lies over your truth. They showed you how little they knew you and what little faith they had in you as a person, partner and daughter. They showed you how cruel, heartless and toxic they could be.\n\nWere I you, I don\u2019t know if I could ever trust them again. I would always feel apprehension around any relationship with them. I would feel as though I would be waiting for the next time they decide I\u2019m not worthy of their love. \n\nYour sister put you in serious danger. It\u2019s possible you were violated and don\u2019t know and never will. You could have been killed. And she didn\u2019t care. I would never forgive that. I would never associate with someone capable of that. She\u2019s dangerous. And you still don\u2019t know why she blew up your life. What kind of a person does that?\n\nI personally don\u2019t think having them in your life is worth the risk. But that\u2019s my opinion. I would be fearful of any sort of relationship with them because in order to have a relationship one has to be vulnerable with people. \n\nI hope you figure out what is best for you. I think you should speak to a therapist if possible. You asked for advice. I think you should continue to live the life you have built without them. I know that sounds harsh and would be difficult. It just seems like they were never in your corner to begin with and couldn\u2019t be trusted to do so now.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the upvotes and awards!",

Actual atoning is hard.\n\nOP, you have seen your parents' and your sister's true faces. Ask yourself:\n\n* Do you really want these people in your life?\n* Do you really think that you can trust them?\n* If push came to shove, don't you think they'd abandon you again?\n* If you pursue legal charges against your sister, what would your parents do?\n* **What are your parents currently doing? Have they cut out your sister?**\n* **Have they run to your doorstep saying \"we have cut out your sister, forgive us!\" If your parents want to be back in contact with you, are they ready to \"punish\" your sister? What will be their consequences for Nicky?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat said:\n\n* You don't have to forgive them.\n* You don't have to be in contact with them.\n* You have to focus on yourself, heal and build yourself a life of your choice with people who love and support you.\n* You don't owe your sister, your fiance or your parents anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome things which bother me:\n\n* BTW, what kind of family waits for OP with **both sets of parents** present?\n* Also, OP's sister sees her leave, presumably drunk with a guy, and does nothing to check whether she voluntarily leaving... and nobody bats an eye?\n* If OP had had someone at her side, she could have been rape-tested and tested for drugs.\n* The parents apparently now know that Nicky has lied. And life continues as normal?\n\n**BTW, I keep seeing these \"revenge fantasies\" of OP \"exposing\" her sister in front of her husband. This will not be helpful to OP. Unless OP has proof, all the sister's husband will see is a \"raving conspiracy lunatic\".** The sister will zip up again and tell him that she had to tell OP's ex that OP was betraying him and that OP is just delusional/blaming her/wants to destroy their marriage now.\n\n**OP needs to secure proof first before doing the \"exposing\" proposed by redditors (if she even wants to, which is her own decision). Otherwise it'll just blow up in her face.**",

Think of yourself first and trust your instincts. Do not meet with or forgive your family/ex if you don't want to. Please don't meet with them. They don't seem sincere. If your family really wanted to make amends and see you, if they actually tried looking for you, they wouldve found you, they would've accompanied your ex to see you when he stopped by. They would've apologized right then and there. But they did not. They don't mean it. They do all that to you and and want you to be the one who comes to them? No. THEY have to come to YOU if they want want explain themselves and ask for your forgiveness. And you do not owe them anything. I'm not trying to scare you but it puts your safety at risk if you meet with them in a private space (or anywhere, really).

Maybe after they have completely disowned her for two years and treat her like garbage how they did with you\u2026. MAYBE then you could forgive them. (But don\u2019t, seriously, f*ck all of them)",

Since your sister confessed what she did, gather more evidence and bring her to justice. And her friend too. What they did is a crime and should be punnished. I wouldn't give your family a chance by any means. They threw you out. They didn't listen you. If I were in your position, they would've been dead to me.",

They realized they were blocked, and left it at that. Which is fine, if i block your ass I certainly don't want you coming to my house. \n\nBut it also shows that these \"parents\" don't actually give a shit that they chose the wrong side. They aren't embarrassed by their own behavior or mortified that they abandoned their own daughter that was drugged and possibly raped. \n\nThe parents are upset that Nickys confession is now making them *look bad in the public eye.* That's it. So they will do the bare minimum in order to say \"see!? We apologized! She chose not to forgive us. That isn't our fault!\" Just so they don't look like piss ants to outsiders. \n\nPersonally, I say fuck em. I've cut people off permanently for less. For this? Drugging, arranging the (potential) rape of your own sister? Assaulting your daughter while she tries to explain her side? Making her homeless for years? Not so much as even verifying she isn't dead in a ditch until it suddenly has consequences for YOU? Let them burn in the house fire they created themselves. \n\nThe only person remotely redeemable here is the ex fiance. If my partner went missing over night, I was shown photos that looked like them leaving with someone else, the other person was called on the spot and confirmed they fucked, I would have a hard time trusting my partner too. Being set up like this is such an absurd, tv crime drama esque situation that for my own mental health I'd need the space too. At least when the guy got confirmation of the lies he showed up, sincerely apologized, explained everything, and then respected OPs wishes for space and left her alone, with the option of contact should she choose. \n\nBut the family members can straight up go fuck themselves. The sister has a special place in hell. And the parents are pretentious fucks. Oh poor them. Suddenly they miss the kid they abandoned for dead for 2 years now that the reformed addict has once again made outsiders question their parenting.",

The only way I'd consider forgiving them is if Nicky has been completely cut off.\n\nOtherwise, I think OP should say she'll meet with them only on the condition that Nicky and her husband are there and that OP gets to speak first, without interruption, and say what she should've been allowed to say two years ago. \n\nAnd then OP should tell everyone about how her sister drugged her and she should ask her sister point blank \"do you even know if I was raped that night?

            "comment": "OP, others have already given you important input on that matter. From summarising what your sister did to you (drugging you, ruining your reputation and then letting you rot), to urging you to not make a quick \"forgive and forget\". I want to tell you the following:\n\n1. Make an assessment of the damage done to you. And by that I don't mean the emotional damage and the trauma you went through. Were you planning to go to university, but couldn't because you were disowned? Are their any kind of inheritances or other funds that you were cut out of because of what your sister did to you? If you parents want to make amends, they have to make plans correcting that.\n2. Your family and your ex-fiance have to set the record straight (**In the coming weeks, this point is actually the first one that needs to be adressed**). To everybody in your family, in your hometown, to their friends, to your former friends, to anyone they ever told the story of their \"cheating daughter\". Your reputation has been severely damaged by this and if they want to mend things, THEY have to do the work of fixing it. Even if this means travelling to every church in your county to spread the truth.\n3. Ask your ex-fianc\u00e9 what his plans are. He has to be prepared to start at zero again. Regardles if he did it without \"knowing better\", he threw you in a ditch without questioning the story once. He cannot allow himself to ease his guilt by blaming your sister. He has to be brutally honest about the two years he spent without you. He has to accept that both of you are not childhood sweethearts anymore. Every ounce of trust that was lost has to be rebuild again. Don't let yourself be fooled by your own emotions on this. You are probably feeling like living a nightmare and now your are seeing the ray of hope, that will make everything how it once was. But it won't. You and your **ex** need therapy to adress the whole situation. After therapy both of you can start working on being a couple again. If you want that.\n4. Ask you parents what their plans are. In some way their behavior is **worse** than that of your fianc\u00e9. They were your parents and some of the things they burned in their self-righteous fury may be unreclaimable. They have to acknowledge that. Make them face the question, what they would have done if you were going down a really dark path. My advice for them would be to write a detailed letter about your hardship and emotions you felt when they threw you out. How you felt when they played happy family with your sister. Give them the letter before you talk with them or make any other contact. After that therapy is also needed with them and apart from the therapy with your ex.\n5. Your sister has to be persona non grata in your life and everybody else's your are in contact with. Even if it splits the family. Even if sister becomes pregnant. Her actions were vile and unredeemable. No \"coming to jesus moment\" can fix this. And it doesn't matter if you change your stance on this in one or two decades. Right now this is, no this HAS to be the deal.\n\nAt last I want to give you the following advice. The things I listet under point 2. are actually the most important right now. Before you even tell them about points 1,3,4 and 5, they have to set the record straight and you need proof of that. It is the first step for them.",

No one believed you after knowing you your entire life. No one was worried for you, even with having the responsibility of duty and care as any parent does. \nI know it hurts to be betrayed by those who should have loved you the most, but they have shown you in a very cruel way they are not your family at all. \nMy advice would be to cut them all off, go NC, invest in yourself by going through therapy and live a good life. Do that and you will find and build your own family one day, if that is what you wish. No amount of talking with these sociopaths would help, they would just emotionally manipulate you into oblivion. \nAs for the fianc\u00e9, if you need closure, you can hear him out if you think it might help. But I doubt you will find any solace in it. He betrayed you as well. At best he is a spineless coward who gave into pressure from his family. At worst, someone who never knew you, trusted you or cared for your well being. \nGood luck. This is really tough but I don\u2019t doubt you will make the right decision.",

            "comment": "Please give an update on the situation as i am very interested to see how things turn out. Also after revisiting this in my opinion your family sounds very toxic or at the very least your sister (obviously)  and your mom do. With that being said I understand not everyone has the heart to go no contact with family but if you think about it they already did that to you so hold them up to the same standard. They disowned you and abandoned you. As for the fianc\u00e9 I would say if you want to rekindle your friendship then by all means give it a shot as he was manipulated as well, but there\u2019s too much trauma in the relationship now so I would advise against \u201ctrying to pick things up where they left off\u201d. I don\u2019t know you personally, but I\u2019m so angry and frustrated for you I can\u2019t even imagine the struggles you must\u2019ve had mentally. I\u2019m just a stranger on the internet, but I hope you\u2019ll take all of these comments into consideration. Lastly I understand it\u2019s wrong to be vengeful, but please warn your sister\u2019s husband somehow about who she really is because she is truly an evil person. If she treats her own kin like that I wouldn\u2019t want to be her enemy. Good Luck!!!!!",

And I may have an idea what could help your familial situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nas i understand it, your evil sister destroyed your life by a complot worthy of a james bond villain. and your whole family betrayed you by trusting her.\n\nyour main problems are :\n\n1. how to have any trust in your repentant father and ex boyfriend ?\n2. how to have a life again ?\n3. how to make your sister and mother pay ?\n4. &amp;#x200B;\n\nin fact, they have provide the solution themselves :\n\n**make a criminal report for Gang Rape against your sister and her friend.**\n\n\\- you have been drugged and brang to the friend home. he CLAIMED that he fucked you all night.\n\n\\- your sister avow she made it happened.\n\n\\- your mother got you out for this very reason.\n\nthey have no way to deny the facts. even if you cannot proved that there was actual rape, THEY ALL ACTED LIKE IT WAS. they cannot deny it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\non the other side, it is the only redeeming action your father and your ex can prove their good faith. but being totaly on your side against those who abused you all, they will have a way to prove you they can be trusted one day. your father was willing to pay to better your live. he can now pay the attorney.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nplus, whoever will interct with your sister and you r mother must know their level of evil. you make a first step with present sister BF. but it is not enough. they must face the consequence of this shitstorm less they will do it again and again. there is no way you could pardon her. they broke your life for futile reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit is time to counterstrike. it will be the test of your allies and the mending of your soul.\n\nhave no pity. your sister and your mother had none and they are beyond redemption.",

As for getting back together with him, that\u2019s gonna take basically an entire restart of the relationship, after 2 years apart you are both probably different people.\nLastly the sister, she does t deserve an ounce of happiness, and it would be my life\u2019s goal to absolutely ruin her maggiage, if it was the last thing I ever did.",

    "postText": "I know nobody\u2019s going to read this, but I had to write this somewhere.\n\nI love my boyfriend. I love the way he plays with my hair and compliments me every single day. We\u2019ve been dating for two years. I love the way he asks me how I am so pretty. I love how he loves me. And not just who I look like. He likes my nerdy ass. He likes me. I love the way he listens to me and when I tell him I feel like eating something, he books a reservation for a restaurant of what I\u2019m feeling about eating on our next date. I love how he buys me a small flower every women\u2019s day and tells me he wants to see me grow my career and be a great woman who influences the world. I love the way he carries my things even when I tell him it\u2019s not necessary. I love the was he laughs at my jokes, even when they\u2019re not that funny. I love the way he kisses me and loves me. I love the way he imagines a future where we live in a small apartment with only a room and a kitchen and we\u2019ll be dying to study and pay rent but we\u2019ll be together. I love the way he laughs his ass off when I tell him to go to McDonald\u2019s. I love the way we play videogames together and mockingly insult each other when we game. I love the way he is. I love him. That\u2019s all.",

He used to be SO sweet and SO loving,and simple,y isn\u2019t the same anymore. Not gonna lie, it made me cry reading both this post and his old letters because of how much I miss that kind of love",

We remind each other that it's no longer me it's we, we'll always have each others backs.  Showing appreciation. And make sure they understand they're appreciated. Women and men think quite differently, always remember that.",

We have been together 15 years and I really do love him more every day. \n\nWe both work from home and are natural homebodies so we are together pretty much all the time (except he works an odd night schedule and I'm on a regular day shift) and I wouldn't change a thing. I still miss him sometimes when he's just in the bedroom asleep.\n\nHe's my best friend, my The One. If something happens to him I'm done because I'd never be able to love anyone as much. \n\nNot everyone gets a \"love of their life\" unfortunately, but I hope you've found yours. I know I found mine \u2764\ufe0f",

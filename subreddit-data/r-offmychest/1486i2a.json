    "postText": "I (20m) stop having feelings for people as soon as I start experiencing their feelings for me and I don\u2019t know what to do. this has happened every time I\u2019ve been in a relationship. I\u2019ve been in multiple throughout my life, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t even get to the official stage because as soon as the third date hits and they express their interest in me I get something like the \u201cick.\u201d \n\ncurrently I\u2019m in a relationship with someone i will call A(23m). we\u2019ve been officially dating for just over two months, our talking/dating phase lasted about the same amount of time, and we\u2019ve known each other for about a year now. \n\ndo NOT get me wrong- A is an amazing person. we\u2019re interested in all of the same things, he is so kind and caring and understanding (especially with the little quirks I have, being neurodivergent,) but it feels like as soon as we hit the one month mark I started thinking about breaking up with him. every time he tells me how much he likes me and how glad he is that I\u2019m in his life, etc., I get extremely uncomfortable, and this is how it\u2019s always been for me. it sucks because I love being in a relationship, I love love, and he is so good and good for me. I know that i still have feelings for him, but they feel like so much less than they were, and not just in an \u201cI\u2019m comfortable with you now and I\u2019m leaving the honeymoon phase\u201d way. \n\nI feel like part of the reason I do this is because of anxiety and self-sabotage, (I have some trauma but that\u2019s another can of worms,) but I don\u2019t know how to get over it and to just be happy in a relationship. especially because once I start feeling like this, the little things which are inconsequential and don\u2019t actually have an effect on our relationship start to seem like dealbreakers, (I don\u2019t like the career he\u2019s thinking of having.) \n\nThanks for reading I guess!",

    "postText": "For starters I am young I wont say exact age but you might be able to guess (and sorry if my grammar sucks I am not the best at english) I want to start with a memory I have that is only about a year ago. I came back from work with my mom (we work at a flea market on the weekends). My neighbors were doing a cookout and my mom was helping. I was sitting in the couch when my mom walked in from outside and sat beside me, she hugged and kisses my forehead and said \u201cnever change, don\u2019t become a quiet and problematic teen like your brother, always stay obedient and happy\u201d   (thats the best I can translate what she said) I said yes and she made me promise it and I did for only 3 more months. That memory never fails to make me cry. I don\u2019t why or when but from one day to the next I became a completely different person. I was always a happy obedient son who never talked back, was the best of friends with my mom and made my sister play. My brother wasn\u2019t a bad son or anything but he was basically the opposite of me in terms of personality. I remember I starter talking back, arguing all the time became quiet disobedient, my dad threatened to spank me multiple times due to just how bad I had started behaving. My mom still thinking her son was just going thru a short faze always defended me. She always held on hope that one day I would wake up and \u201cher son would come back\u201d ( she would say that to me often). But I became careless argued and always made my mom sad. Began hating my sister and before I knew it smoking and drinking. If you knew me in person you would never in a million years believed I could be like this I was the opposite of what I use to be. And then one day I cut myself. This is something many would say is a sign that my parents where maybe doing something wrong that maybe they where the reason for all of this. But they weren\u2019t. I still am not sure the reason to why I did this and It was multiple times. My best conclusion is it was for attention from my peers in school. I became worst by the day, a kid who was so joyful and talked like a parrot was now quiet and didn\u2019t want to do a thing with my parents and for literally no reason they are the greatest parents ever. Some time later my parents found out I had cut myself. It was like a movie scene they cried so much and all I could think about was how now I had an advantage to get away with much more. I didn\u2019t care my mom sobbed so much thinking it was her fault. Well fast forwarding a lot of more bad behavior and heavier use of weed and we are at a movie theater with some of my parent\u2019s friends, I loved movies so I decided to tag along. I went to the bathroom to get as high as I could before the movie started (of course in the darkness and the movie playing they didn\u2019t notice) One of my mom\u2019s friends she hadn\u2019t seen in a while saw me and said what happened to him? When I say I became and opposite of what I once was I mean everything. Dressing style hairstyle everything. And I just know its cause I was completely stoned that that line hurt and then my mom said \u201cI guess they change\u201d And that was like a reality slap. Like I had been in a trance for about a year and those words snapped me out of it. I started reflecting everything and basically made the realization of everything I just said, that memory of my mom telling me to never change popped in my head and I sobbed till I fell asleep in the theater. Some time later me and my mom where going to a 3 day festival together just us and my sister. I realized how awkward it became to talk to my mom like I use to since I spent so long just either quiet or arguing. My mom had given up thinking her son was coming back, while in the hotel bed she hugged my sister and said \u201cu don\u2019t, don\u2019t grow up\u201d and almost cried I knew she had accepted that she was eventually goin to as-well and It hurt her not because she didn\u2019t want us to grow up she always said she wanted to see us grow, its cause of how I turned out. And then I realized how badly I failed to keep my promise and became worst than my brother. Ive tried to go back and be friends with my mom again and just in general be a joyful son again. But my mom had accept fully that her son had changed and \u201cgrown up\u201dShes less joyful herself now too and it hurts me knowing I am the reason. I want to go back and fix it, I wanna go back and keep my promise. But after about a year both my parents just see me as the knew who always argued and had cut himself still thinking its their fault, even I see myself as that and know of all my messed up thoughts and drug use I just don\u2019t recognize myself and I cant fully write exactly just how much I hurt my parents and especially my mom I regret everything.",

    "postText": "Was I raped?\n\n\nI don't know what to think exactly. I might be overreacting as well. We, me and my ex partner, approximately a week ago decided to call it quits and I decided to move out, because it's his house. It was mutual decision, we both were crying messes, even shouting to each other but nonetheless it got eventually better n we were cold to each other but fine. So yesterday I texted him, saying I wanted to stop by. And went to his house to grab my essentials back, he was home even though he's usually at work at that time. We sat, had conversations about each other, our relationship, mistakes, good memories. Coming up short I stood up, mumbled apology and wishing nothing but the best. He sorta ran towards me, grabbed my hands, pinned me to the wall, saying I must definitely see someone else because I seem to be in a rush and nasty shit. While I was defending myself, he began crying and telling how much he misses me and all. He kinda was forcing himself on me, kissing, biting but since I didn't want it only got pain to me. I said I wanna go home and let me go, he kept saying this is home and just laid me down on floor and had his way with me. I don't exactly remember moving my arms or legs or shouting I was simply shocked, stunned to see him undoing his belt and pants and next thing I knew he was inside me. I think he didn't notice me being silent, I wasn't shoting or trying to run either but I was crying ? I was able to feel my face getting wet and then him on me but nothing else, I wasn't thinking anything but kinda had this panic feeling in me somehow ? He finished, began crying again and eventually fell asleep. I stood up and got home as fast as I possibly could. Prior to that, we had never this kinda connection. He always was asking for my consent every time and I don't know. I'm not really sure but I think I did get a smell of alcohol from him, but again it could be my mind justifying him. Is that, the thing we lived, okay?",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm really sorry this happened to you and yes it was. He did that. There's also no \"overreacting\" when it comes to consent. Consent is always a must and both parties must ensure it's there. He didn't ensure that. It doesn't matter whether you defended yourself or not. Amd please also know that there's also no wrong reaction to what happened. The only thing that matters is what you feel is right. I hope you have someone in your life who you can talk to in person about this so they can support you in whatever decision you wanna make now in how to move forward and again am really sorry that this happened.",

Plus trying to get an actual conviction for said rape is really hard. Unfortunately it today\u2019s society the victims are blamed and gaslit and made to feel ashamed it happened to them instead of punishing the rapist.",

I have been sitting on floor for hours, staring off, just thinking whether it was me or him, who's guilty and whatnot. Because he was so sweet, decent, such a nice guy, well I thought so till yesterday. When you meet new people and see one smart, kind, decent, extrovert, totally normal guy and like them, wanting to be a friend of his, that was who he used to be in my eyes. All along in this 5 years of our relationship he made me feel like queen, appreciated, seen. I genuinely thought we would get married, have kids, grow gray and such cheesy shit. Everybody saw us, liked us. So processing yesterday, admitting i loved someone like him hurted more than yesterday. But I won't be silent. He reached out to me, came my home, calling, shouting, texting he was high and drunk and is so sorry - I won't be silent or stay victim. Edit : he didn't use protection, I'm not on the pills either, even tho just got back from hospital I feel so anxious. Simply because I don't think I'd able to have a kid. Not right now, not his kids.",

I will straight up gaslit myself about what happened at times. Remember that you did nothing wrong or you didn\u2019t cause it to happen. In the end your ex was a predator that took advantage of you. Even if he was drunk or high, it shows you what he was/is capable of doing. Protect yourself as best as you can and steel your spine as best as you can if you are seeking justice.

He was there for me in some of my darkest most challenging life events. It was quite complicated, but at the end of our relationship I learned he (1) was a peeping Tom and peeped on  my cousin, who was also his best friend/roommates girlfriend, while she changed clothes or tried to sneak in and peep on her in the shower and (2) he consistently raped me in my sleep for I don\u2019t even know how long. Especially when we moved for me to go to college, and he\u2019d feed me shots on a daily basis until I blacked out and went to sleep.  Too complex to describe in a single comment but know this - you are not \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d or anything at all for loving a man who was capable of this behavior. This says absolutely nothing about you. Nothing. It speaks to his character and his own issues, and not yours. \n\nYou are strong and resilient. And I believe you. I never reported my ex. Maybe I should have. Maybe he won\u2019t do these things again. Maybe he will. I don\u2019t feel great about it. I\u2019ve even considered making a report now, though we\u2019ve been broken up for 2 years and it\u2019s not like I can give specific dates of when things happened. But maybe if it does happen again, having my report will help bolster the next victims complaint. I truly hope he gets the help he needs, but I also needed to get the help I needed to even wrap my head around the fact that it happened. And I\u2019m still working on it. \n\nSending you love, anonymous friend. You are a light in this world and I wish you the best.",

Yes, there are many DIFFERENT signs depending on the person, but if you can not read them clearly and that is an issue you have, then you get verbal consent each time. Some people can understand nuances, and others can't. If you can't, then all consent should be verbal. If the consent is not enthusiastic. If the person is not clearly excited to be having sex with you and encouraging you to do more, stop. If they want it, they will say so when you stop or pull you to keep going.",

There is a difference even if all the results end up as a person is dead or raped. \n\nAnd once again, subjectivity should never be used as an excuse for rape.

And I don't like it when something this important is \"up for interpretation\". \n\nIt even further drifts me away from the idea of sex because there's a chance of misinterpretation that the consequences have heavy costs. \n\nbut I do agree with you, it is probably not a good idea to talk about this here. It's just the original comment hit me close to home, as when I confronted the person (I was in my teens when I confronted him) who molested me all those years, he used the reason that I didn't really fight back and also according to him, I enjoyed it. Which there is some true to all of this, I was a child who didn't even know what sex was with an adult I trusted. But even after learning about sex and everything, I still didn't completely fight back either. Until one day I saw him grooming another child that was around my age when he started doing things to me, it was a big wake up call of the reality of things. \n\nHe was and still am an absolutely a terrible person. I will just put that out there. But when I look at things from his perspective, and his \"reasons\", there is always some truths to it. Even if those truths are not definitely enough to say \"oh, what he did was fine because \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\". It just made me realize there are things that I could've done way better to have prevented the situation I was in. \n\nOne could argue that I don't like including any subjectivity when it comes to consent, because I was once a victim of the result of the other person acting off of his interpretation of my feelings and emotions.",

It is not difficult to tell if a person wants to have sex or not. If there's any hesitation at all, there's your answer. If you really aren't sure by their reaction, then err on the side of caution and just don't. Like damn no one's gonna die cause you didn't get to fuck, it's not a big deal to skip that session because of uncertainty. Why risk *raping* a person? \n\nUnless you're neurodivergent and *do* have some difficulty reading people's behaviors, I don't understand how this is a problem. If that is the case though, like the other commenter said, you can rely on verbal consent more.

There is nothing sexier than \"would you like me to do this to you?\" And \"how does that feel?\" Etc along the way.\n\nConsent is the most important thing. As soon as you don't have that, everything you are doing to the other person is HARMING them. Trust me, I have never felt pleasure from unwanted touching. It won't suddenly feel good and I'll change my consent from negative to positive if something is forced on me.",

Block him on socials and phone/text. (Unless you do decide to report and are advised otherwise by those involved in your case) If you absolutely must go back and retrieve anything else make sure you take AT LEAST one other extremely supportive and trustworthy person with you, and make sure they stay in your presence at all times.",

Or of course, you have the option to do nothing.\n\nOnly you can decide  what is right for you, but even reaching out to an advocacy center can help in finding resources to help you cope with this assault in a healthy manner. The trauma reactions to rape are fight, flight, or freeze, and I work in the field of sexual assault care\u2026the most common is the \u201cfreeze\u201d reaction.

He prevented you from leaving and decided on sex FOR you. Even IF he was confused and/or emotionally clouded, he still restrained and forced you.\n\nBreakups are raw and unpredictable. A lot of couples have (consensual) confused sex that one or neither of them really want. Unfortunately, this happens too-- one partner doesn't want to let go, and their anger and frustration propels them to sexual violence.\n\nIt's sexual violence no matter where his head was at, though. If he'd raped you while he was blackout drunk, it'd still be rape. But he remembers what he did, as he wasn't blackout drunk-- He was asserting control. Even if you don't go the legal route, you should really accept this as rape so keep him from capitalizing further on your confusing and trauma-response.\n\nThis is the person you're no longer in a relationship with: a person who gets jealous and paranoid, and responds to those feelings by raping the person he alleges to love. That's who he is. Please don't lose sight of that.",

Admitting it happened is the first step. \nIf you have any friends/parents/siblings etc that you trust, tell them about it and let them help you through this, it will make a major difference. If not, reach out to me or anyone else who\u2019s offering in the comments to talk/listen.\nBlock him on every single thing you can, and have any friends/family do the same. If you have anything left at his house, either meet publicly or ask someone else to pick it up for you. \nI\u2019m so sorry you had to go through this, but please try to be easy on yourself and reach out for help when needed. You are not alone and you are not at fault for what happened.",

I'm stuck with him right now but I think I finally got help to get out but it's going to be another week. Anyway, I don't care if he was drinking, what he did was not ok. It's abuse as well. Please report him to the police and stay far away from him. You may even be able to get a restraining order. Hugs \ud83e\udec2",

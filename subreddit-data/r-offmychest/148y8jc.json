    "postText": "My social media feeds have been flooded recently with graduation photos of people from my high-school class getting university degrees in complicated sciences, starting their own businesses, achieving weight loss goals, and getting jobs in their field.\n\nI feel behind and stupid, i\u2019ve gotten my marketing diploma but all my peers are already onto field jobs but I chose to go for my bachelor of commerce and it almost feels like a mistake, like it\u2019ll take me longer now to have a career. I felt pressured to work for my dad instead to do marketing and sales for his company and I feel like i\u2019ll never actually get where I need to be. I\u2019m holding a 3.7 GPA but in my program it feels like an underachievement considering I know most of my class held that average or higher. \n\nIt feels like i\u2019m a nothing despite having decent enough achievements. It feels like most people can say they have something they are good at, or something thats special about them but I have nothing like that, i\u2019m just average at everything, not even my own boyfriend can tell me something that\u2019s special about me that isn\u2019t about how I look or some normal relationship benefit I can give him like sex, being supportive of his hobbies, or being nice to him. Hence why I tried so hard in school but even then I only ended up being average, even now as i\u2019m working I\u2019m unmotivated so once again-average or failing.\n\nI\u2019m even failing at losing weight, my boyfriend gently mentioned that he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to me if I got too big and its made me obsessed with getting back to my pre-college weight. For reference I was 132 when we started, went up to 147 during the first year of school, then down to 137 after a year of dieting, exercising, failing, then repeating.\n\nOn top of all of this I have no friends, depression has made hobbies unbearable to even attempt, and performing tasks and errands for all my family members all the time has me burnt out and feeling like i\u2019m not even a person anymore, I feel so much like i\u2019m just here to give as much energy to other people as possible or else i\u2019m useless. It\u2019s even gotten to the point where I force myself to be intimate with my partner because I feel like that\u2019s all im good for/bring to the relationship.\n\nOverall, no matter what I do i\u2019m average or failing and its destroyed me. Sorry if this post is all over the place, everything just kind of started spilling out.",

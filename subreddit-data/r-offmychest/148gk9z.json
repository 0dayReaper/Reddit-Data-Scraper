    "postText": "I started a new job in April - I was told the dress code was \u201cdress for your day\u201d, which is a departure from the old dress code of business casual / dark denim on Fridays (listed in the employee manual). Our office is also largely remote - I go in between 2 - 3 times a week just to get out of my house.\n\nToday, I wore - a plain flowy cotton T-shirt tucked into blue cotton striped shorts and flip flops. While the outfit is very casual, my cleavage is not showing nor is my ass hanging out. The office manager made a comment - not rude at all, just more of a \u201cheads up\u201d that there were no shorts or flip flops allowed. I just said ok and thanks,  because I didn\u2019t want to pick a fight over something trivial. It\u2019s really no big deal but made me self conscious\u2026I\u2019ve also been dealing with imposter syndrome, so it sat heavily there, too. Just needed to vent this out because I\u2019m a 28 year old woman who just got dress coded at the office.",

            "comment": "Your boss might not have the interpersonal skills to say that dress for your day might mean casual clothes. Personally, I have never worked a job except as a lifeguard that allowed me to wear sandals. But I'm not sure what to make of the shorts issue, other than to say play it safe and wear pants, jeans, or a skirt.\n\nI guess it really depends on the atmosphere of the job and if you have to deal with customers face to face. Personally, I prefer to dress the part. Nothing screams nonprofessional more than to look like you are getting ready to go to the beach. How would you feel if you go to a mechanic's shop and the people are dressed in a way that makes them look incompetent? I would walk right out and take my business elsewhere, I expect to see coveralls, jeans, work shirts, boots, etc...\n\nIt all has to deal with playing the part and first impressions are very hard to shake off. Especially if it comes at the expense of losing customers, clients, and potential customers.",

When i know i am working with others (an event, directors meeting, etc.) I do dress business formal / professional. I understand where you are coming from, though. Both of my prior work experiences (non-profit and private / corporate) had no dress-code and sandals were allowed. This job is also non-profit. I figured tailored cotton shorts that hit above the knee would be fine, but I miscalculated. It\u2019s hard to learn office culture in an office where not many people come into the office and all of my interviews were virtual. At least now I know for next time! This is a job where I\u2019ll have to keep a pair of flats stashed at my desk.",

Course, I like everything in writing and if all else fails I just go tshirt and jeans. If he has an issue with that, then just ask him to explain in detail what the issue is. Sorry, but I tend to get into trouble because I am very detail oriented and I don't miss much.",

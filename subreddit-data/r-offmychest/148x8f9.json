    "postText": "Pretty sure I\u2019m going to hell for this, but it\u2019s how I feel.  I dated this guy that was a friend of some of my friends for 6 months.  The first 3 were amazing, he was smart, funny, really nice, and we had a great time. I really thought he might be the one. Then he flipped. He started getting really paranoid about who I was talking to, would leave me on read but get mad if I didn\u2019t respond immediately. Any little thing would set him off, like if my expression was \u201cweird\u201d or I checked the time on my phone quickly he would accuse me of cheating or being bored with him and melt down. He blocked me without even telling me why. So I let him go, because it was getting kind of scary and intense.  A week later, he\u2019s back in my DMs begging for another chance because he spiraled and he apparently has BPD and it makes him feel crazy but he loves me and wants to fix things. I told him we could be friends but I didn\u2019t want to date anyone for awhile. He agreed.\n\nFast forward to a couple of weeks ago, he\u2019s been behaving himself but still clingy. We hung out with mutual friends a few times but never alone. Then my dad died. I\u2019m devastated. My dad was my best friend. I go back home immediately to help deal with things and go to the funeral. There I am crying my eyes out in my childhood bedroom the night before my dad\u2019s funeral because it feels like the whole world is ending and who shows up in my DMs?  My fucking ex having a meltdown because of some guy he thinks I paid too much attention to the last time we all hung out.\n\nI will admit I lost my shit completely on him.  I gave him both barrels and then blocked him on everything. Didn\u2019t check my phone the rest of the night, I just binge watched Netflicks until I passed out.  After the funeral, I check my messages and the mutual friend groups have blown up.  My ex attempted suicide with a lot of random pills after telling people he was going to die because I hate him. They got him to the hospital but lost him in ICU later. It\u2019s apparently not the first time he\u2019s done something like that.\n\nNobody blames me and they keep reassuring me that it\u2019s not my fault, but I don\u2019t even feel bad. I\u2019ve never been so angry at someone. If he wants to take himself out over something so stupid, let him. At least he\u2019s not my problem anymore.",

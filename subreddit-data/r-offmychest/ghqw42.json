Cheap or expensive they all do it! \n\nUsually it boils down to 2 options....nipples on show or uniboob workout. Or I could just like y\u2019know fix it but fuck that when I\u2019m in a rush!\n\nEDIT: apparently the curse of the Uniboob is a plague upon us all! \n\nThanks for the comments and awards everyone...can\u2019t reply to you all because my inbox is carnage atm. \n\nAnd to answer the most common private message. why yes, i did realise....it is literally...off my chest and no I won\u2019t take my bra off \ud83d\ude02 I don\u2019t like to disappoint more than person in a 24 hour period as a personal goal. \n\nAnd to the ladies apparently Puma is the brand we need to go with to avoid this issue.

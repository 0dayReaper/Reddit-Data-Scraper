Right-wing authoritarians are people who have a high degree of willingness to submit to authorities they perceive as established and legitimate, who adhere to societal conventions and norms and who are hostile and punitive in their attitudes towards people who do not adhere to them. They value uniformity and are in favour of using group authority, including coercion, to achieve it.[1]\n\n\nDirectly from wikipedia folks. Peace out bitches.",

I just always blinked a couple of times and said my very, very religious family made me stay home from church if I needed for school, and that God wasn\u2019t taking attendance at every service or holding a stop watch to make sure you met your time quota. \n\n\nMy dad would also give me a mini version of the sermon and pray with me when he got home.

There was zero social distancing. No customers with masks. Anyone that came in leaned around the plexiglass barrier. Every step I took back, they'd step forward. \n\n\nLike you, I've had bronchial issues since I was a baby and I very clearly remember sitting on the floor playing with my Kermit hand-puppet while having an oxygen mask on. I grew up carrying inhalers in my pencil case. I get bronchitis at least once per year and we were just starting to figure out if I have an immunity issue, which we do believe is a problem. I don't want this. I don't want to get this because some idiot believed their freedom to not wear a mask is more important than my health. \"Just stay home then\" isn't a great solution, especially since everyone seems to need everything to open again. And when the boss calls me, I'll be expected to go back despite zero precautions by him or clients. If I refuse, I lose EI payments and have to find a new job, one that respects the current situation, while everyone else is also looking for work. \n\nAnd it's at this point I start daydreaming about commercial flights to Mars.",

So even people who don't care if they get sick should wear a mask.\n\nHealthy-feeling asymptomatic people are major spreaders of this virus and a mask significantly decreases their impact on the spread of covid19. This is why mask wearing is so important, it's not about the wearer, it's about the potential spreaders. \n\nIf everyone with covid wore a mask, it would die out and we could reopen the economy a lot sooner. But it's impossible to know who has it, so the only sure way is for absolutely everyone to wear a mask, not just people who are afraid of getting sick.\n\nWearing a mask makes you a responsible adult, not a fearful one!",

Honestly it made me mad, eventhough I am from Europe. I seen all the comments, and I seen all of these people think, this is really just political. Here in my country we have to wear masks, and we have 6 or even less cases a day luckly. I commented and tried to explained to her  that this is just selfish, but the only thing I got is that I am just a sheep in the crowd. Honestly I just feel sorry for those Americans who care about this, or who have medical problems and this virus is dangerous for them.",

I'm in whats now one of the harder hit states because of our governor being a good shill. It really sucks because he was really doing a good job for a time but the second trump said open up he did it and this is what we get. There are like 100 icu beds left in the whole state and my state is pretty fucking big.  It makes me fucking ashamed to be American, really everything that racist Cheetos has done has made me ashamed, but killing off more than 100 thousand people and running up to 200 thousand like its nothing and opening schools so all the kids and teachers die? What in the fuck is the end game?! Ive worn a mask the whole time, I've  got terrible cabin fever from being stuck in my house, and I still sanitize, use my mask and social distance as much as humanly possible. Its just so goddamn selfish of them and since I live in a red state, plus alot of various meth/crack/and junkies they dont give a fuck and are fine. Thank jeebus they actually are enforcing it on our public transport now, its absolutly defies logic for every think for yourselfer out there",

Trump not having masks required at his rally or having 6' spacing was a huge political statement about how he, the GOP president elected by *conservative* Americans, thinks this pandemic is overblown and all medical advice to protect against infection can be easily ignored. \n\nRecently, some gop leaders have started to separate themselves from this behavior, but we can't ignore that it's been largely (maybe exclusively) gop folks that are against covid protection measures, aid, and enforcement. It's been one hugely dangerous political statement since before March.",

Masks were destined to be a political issue in this country because the GOP leans so hard on \"rugged individualism\" that any aid to others is abject weakness. The only danger the GOP cares about is the danger they can spin to blame on out-groups as a threat to their strength. If the attempts to villainize the Chinese had caught on to a greater degree then the GOP might pretend to care, but that fell flat pretty quickly. The official messaging constantly switched between \"China did this\" and \"it's not even real\". If the virus is not real then there is an excuse to ignore it, and if China is a villain then there is a threat from outsiders that excuses momentary weakness.\n\nEdit: I just realized that the R officials erroniously trying to blame propagation of the virus on the habits and hygiene of POC fit into this theory perfectly too.",

By turning mask into a political issue by the ignorant masses, it allows the the highly contagious virus to spread unhampered, which will severely damage the economy. If COVID has a 2% mortality rate means at least 6 million US citizens are going to die and several million will have life long problems because of this.\n\nBut yeah, keep pretending this an issue of freedom when the alternative is to shutdown all local businesses that are deemed nonessential.",

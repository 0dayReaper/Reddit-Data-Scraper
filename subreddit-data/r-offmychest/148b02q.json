    "postText": "Ok here it goes. So I met my friend (I will call him Ben), Ben, through another person who we both discovered simultaneously was kind of a snake in the grass, thus, we ended that friendship, but in the process, we became really good friends like overnight. Consequently, we started hanging out quite a bit, and at times, I felt like maybe I was getting some sexual vibes from him.  All the while, he would do more comfortably acceptable things like pull out his fake vagina and talk a brief moment about how he is experimenting with it.  If I remember, I responded by saying something like oh that looks really interesting, and he responded (I remember this 100%) by saying I can clean really well if you want to try it. Hmmm... I didn't respond but my heart started pounding rather quickly. So we were just becoming closer and closer and everything was awesome. So one night we were at my place, and out of the blue, he  comes over to sit closer to me on the couch and says, \"so what is it like to cum while have anal sex\". I said well, in my opinion, it makes cumming better.  I enjoy it a lot.  And it really didn't go anywhere after that. Then another time he mentioned that he bought a dildo to see if he was gay. Then another he told me he met up with a trans sexual on a dating sight but that they didn't do anything. So this is when I realized I was developing feelings for him, because I became almost offended that he was telling me this and it wasn't me. Then my head just started spinning and I told him that it made me kind of jealous.  Well so not too long after this, I told him I had feelings for him, and at first, he said he didn't want to ruin our friendship by having sex.  But then he just started completely ignoring all of my calls and texts, so then I became so hurt.  I then started just sending him a lot of messages mostly saying why won't you answer any of my messages when you know how much it's hurting my feelings. So I get this sudden message from him and it says, \"I'm not fucking gay, and all I can offer you right now is friendship\". I told him he was the one who had thrown had some shit to make me feel this way to which he replied nothing at all. So I was so hurt and I was depressed and sad, and at one point, I came to the conclusion that he was just selfish and that he really didn't give 2 shits about my feelings. So I told him I wanted to end the friendship. So I started missing him after about 2 weeks, and I also felt like I maybe overreacted.  Lol So he had blocked me, so I sent him really heartfelt message apologizing and only focusing on our friendship on my free texting acct. He told me he missed me a lot and we have been hanging out here and there but it's more distant and I'm still hurt.  I feel like he trampled all over my feelings and never took responsibility for his own actions.  Well actually he never even so much as owned up to what he had said all those times let alone apologized on any level. So I'm left now currently feeling a bit jaded and not really knowing or feeling comfortable with how to move forward or how to deal with my feelings regarding all of this.  Would anyone be so kind as to offer me some direction or advice on this?  Thank you so much in advance!!! \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09",

            "comment": "Sounds to me like your friend just doesnt know who they are, they are very deflective over possibly be gay or other.... You have a built up a form of care and compassion towards your friend that has become romantic and intimate but your friend will not reciprocate because... who knows. \n\nCould be he didnt want to ruin the friendship,\nCould be he is heavily in denial,\nCould be he does want you intimately but knows you would want more than he can offer. \n\nMy advice would be stop apologising as you have done nothing wrong, he has clearly flirted with you which has resonated with you to the core theres no denying that. But secondly give him space. \n\nI know it hurts when we miss people but your bound to of heard the saying \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder\". \n\nYou may miss him but does he miss you. \nYou very quickly shut you out when you propositioned him despite several remarks of a sexual nature that he gestured towards and around you. \n\nGive it time and if it's meant to be that your no longer friends then unfortunately you will have to make peace with that. \n\n&amp; if he changes his mind just be careful and keep your own guard up because he could very quickly flip on you again leaving you hurt yet again. \n\nI honestly wish you the best though OP I hope it works out for you.",

You are right though, I feel as though I need to be careful no matter what happens. I didn't realize it, but distancing myself even now feels more natural and appropriate for my own sanity and emotional well being.  I needed to hear what you said.",

Unfortunately, its ultimately impossible to distinguish exactly how someone is feeling towards you, without them being open and honest which leads us to guessing, then second guessing and eventually giving up. I think going forward just put yourself first and any connections you have with people just be up front about them. Theres absolutely no reason as to why someone can shoe affection and then abruptly lock you out when it suits them. I dated this girl a few years back and dont get me wrong it wasnt a serious relationship it was casual but anyway I digress. First 4 months were fine then she told me she wouldnt be able to see me as often because of her starting university so I said yeah sure no problem even though the university was 20 minutes away from where she lived. Fast forward 4 weeks and I had not heard from her at all to then randomly get a message saying we should end things I.e she ghosted me and effectively wasted my time. I would of rathered she had been up front about how she felt which wouldve been fine with me but ghosting me was shallow and me being naive thought for 4 weeks shes fine she said she wouldnt of been able to talk much, but then it dawned on me no one not even the biggest book worm on the planet can be that into their work to blank out their relationship. \n\nWhat my point is my friend is; just be open with who you are, lay the cards on the table with people you feel a connection with so you dont get hurt, so you domt get your time or feelings wasted. I wish you all the very best and who ever you find yourself in an actual companionship or relationship will let you in and cherish you through and through but remember you matter too.",

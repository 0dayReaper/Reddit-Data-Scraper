    "postText": "I'm young so maybe my point of view is very skewed and not informed by experiencing our history the way a lot of older gays have. \n\nBut I think we shouldn't display kink so hardcore at pride any more. I think the event has shifted into more of a celebration of loving whoever you want and being whoever you want, rather than a straight-up riot. It's an act of rebellion still, but in a modernised way. While kink is an integral part of pride's history, I think it'd be cool if it were a safe space for kids nowadays to check out the culture. I also don't really want to take part in other people's kinks unknowingly or participate in exhibitionism without consent. Maybe we should just split the whole celebration into two events! One adult-oriented celebration and one you could take the family to. \n\nCurrently a lot of homophobes and transphobes believe being LGBT is inherently sexual! And we're just proving them right with kink being so present at pride, an event that's often the only time some people will think they're witnessing gay culture IRL. I know it's shitty to bend over backwards to appease bigoted or misinformed people... but at the same time, you're out in public, please don't wear the leather doggy suit &amp; gag. I don't feel like that's unreasonable? \n\nI've got a friend who for sure would ditch me because of this opinion. I've distanced myself from them since learning what they thought, but I feel wrong for doing that sometimes.\n\nAlso don't get me wrong, I'm not against the concept of rioting in general\ud83e\udd18And I think we should be able to celebrate the sexual parts of our identities! I want to. But in public spaces... I don't think we need to do that any more. \n\nFor reference I'm non-binary femme and pansexual",

            "comment": "as a barely legal adult (21m) any part of pride that has anything overtly sexual in it like kinks and such then i would never subject myself or anybody to have to witness if not comfortable with, let alone younger people, so i do agree somewhat with your stance. however, i\u2019ve read a lot about how sexual liberation and acceptance was and is inherently linked to the LGBTQ+ movement so i try not to be mad at people flaunting their sexuality and freedom at a place meant to celebrate such things. ANOTHER THING I WILL SAY  is that i\u2019ve been at my city\u2019s (a major metropolitan btw) Pride events for years (since i turned 15) and have not once encountered any overt sexuality let alone kinks (at most shirtless men or just people wearing leather), any events that contain kinks or sexual/quasi-sexual activities are closed off and strictly over-18 or even 21 (got denied entry to an over-18 event once despite me being 20 years old and giving them my ID as they thought i looked too young), so i don\u2019t really know which pride celebration you\u2019re talking about where people display their kinks openly even in family-friendly areas.",

As a trans woman, whole fucking states want to make my existence a felony on par with *child molestation* and even the most milquetoast display of sexuality from me is seen as predatory and perverse *simply because I am trans*.\n\nPride is, and always will be, an act of rebellion for me.",

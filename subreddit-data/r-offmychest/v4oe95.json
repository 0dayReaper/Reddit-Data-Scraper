    "postText": "I really want to type this out so that I can read it back one day, so here goes.\n\nToday is the 2 year anniversary of my dad\u2019s death. I am staying with my grandparents (dad\u2019s side) right now because long story short after my dad\u2019s death my mom started seeing a guy who, imo, clearly prefers my brother, and mom\u2019s new bf &amp; I can\u2019t live in the same house. I love my mom but I\u2019m old enough now for her to respect my decision to live with my grandparents for the summer.\n\nToday was an emotional day of course. My grandmom is very sentimental and recently she has been putting together photo albums, one of my dad, one of his brother, of me, and of my brother. Today my grandmom and I were looking through the one of my dad, the bulk of which is photos of him as a kid/teen when he lived with my grandparents but has a few more recent photos. \nOne of these recent photos caught my attention.\n\nSee I have JME (type of epilepsy) that gives me these occasional \u201cjerks\u201d or spasms in my arms and legs. Because of this I\u2019ve never been able to go in water so I never learned to swim. Despite this we went to the beach a lot as a family (CA residents, lol).\n\nThe photo that stood out to me was one of my dad in his 20s, so a bit before I was born, treading water in the ocean, clearly very deep in. My grandmother told me that his brother took the photo when the two of them + their then-girlfriends went cliff diving. I said, but dad couldn\u2019t swim? She was confused and said of course he could, did I really think he was the kind of person to not know how to swim?\n\nFor as long as I can remember, on our frequent family visits to the beach, my dad had told me he couldn\u2019t swim as he was scared of the water so could I keep him company on the beach? This had been great for me of course, as I didn\u2019t want to be alone while my mom and brother went swimming, and we would find other games and things to do while they were in the ocean. To be honest it had always seemed silly to me that he was scared of water, he was a marathon runner / generally very sporty person who grew up in California so I didn\u2019t get why he never just learned. But now I realise that of course he could swim. He knew I didn\u2019t want to be a liability because of my condition, that if I thought he wanted to go I would tell him to go without me and leave me behind, so he told me he couldn\u2019t swim.\n\nHe didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever find out what a nice thing he was doing for me and yet he still did it every time. Especially today, that sent me over the edge. Thank you dad.\n\n\nedit: typo - my dad\u2019s brother took the pic, not my brother. My brother is 15, lol",

I now realise all the sacrifices he made for me and all the special things he did to make up for my Mum's selfish ways.  I was just an only child from a humble background but Dad worked 2 jobs so we could have a week at the coast each year and he was the one who entertained me when all Mum wanted to do was sunbathe and look out for herself! Because of Covid i only saw him for 30 minutes and that was only because he had suffered a severe stroke and they didn't think he would make it. I had been out of the country for 6 months and after isolating as well it broke my heart when he hardly knew who i was anymore. The day i saw him was Father's Day, his birthday was 2 days later, and he died on 27th. \n\n\nI apologise for rambling on and by no means do i mean to detract from OP's post but i'm dreading the rest of the month, i feel so lost and alone. I already suffer with long term physical pain and severe depression. I don't have friends, and my elderly but strong Mum is the only person i have left, i wonder why i carry on if i'm so so unhappy.........",

I only want to see you do great things and I only want you to succeed. I don\u2019t think you feel the same way for me. My whole life you doubted each unique decision I made or tried too. My decisions were never okay unless they were yours. Dad, why can\u2019t you choose to be kind to me and love me unconditionally? I\u2019m sorry we won\u2019t ever have the best relationship that a son and father should. I\u2019m sorry that maybe your addictions carved the way you think today. I know you care about me and love me, I just wish you showed it more. Everyday I get jealous of what someone has with their father. I wish you wanted me to happy more then you want me to be different. I\u2019m sorry I smoked weed, I\u2019m sorry that I have no idea what causes you to be so tired of me. I just want your approval and for you to tell me I\u2019m doing good. You don\u2019t dad. Neither does mom. She\u2019s more toxic then you and all she does is make me feel sad. I used to look up to you dad. Still you\u2019re a great role model, sometimes. I just hope you become so happy today and tomorrow and the rest of your life dad. Please dad, just continue to progress for me. I\u2019m sorry. Don\u2019t be jealous of me cause I saved up money, don\u2019t be jealous that I\u2019m happy, don\u2019t be jealous of my relationship, and don\u2019t be jealous of what others have. You are my dad and that\u2019s an incredible accomplishment because dad, I hope I do great things. I wish you pushed me to do great things. You have a great relationship, three amazing sons, a beautiful wife who has her own beautiful daughter, and you\u2019re a hard worker. I don\u2019t know what causes you to see past all of it and just be so ungrateful.",

I\u2019ve felt loved and I\u2019ve felt anger and I\u2019ve felt jealousy and I\u2019ve felt hate and I\u2019ve felt like he doesn\u2019t really care to hear that I\u2019m doing good. I don\u2019t think like that though. I\u2019m different. I try to be less selfish, I try to be grateful, I don\u2019t forget what\u2019s around me and what I have, I don\u2019t look at others and get jealous, I would support my son, I would guide my son, I would be there for my kid. Right now, I sold corvette and I bought an 07 impreza, childhood dream car. He only had negative things to say to me as I went through the whole selling, searching and buying process. He didn\u2019t want to hear it. He didn\u2019t care what I got. He didn\u2019t want to be happy for me. He just had nothing to say when I asked him what he thought. He searches to find the wrongs in me. It\u2019s just really difficult because when his life is going good he\u2019s the man and nothing can touch him. It\u2019s when everything isn\u2019t going to plan that he\u2019s just so angry. He\u2019s been sober for 7 years too. It\u2019s just extremely difficult.",

Such as \"Jon Smith\" (obv not his name), in a matter of fact way. \n\nWell, the day before he died back in 2007 I got a call from a number I didn't recognize. Mind you my father and I actually share the same name (except middle name). I had been answering the phone in the same way for a while at that point because I liked it and thought it saved time. So I answer \"John Smith\", and surprisingly it was my dad, and he sounded a little flabbergasted and just said \"Well, where'd ya learn to answer the phone like that?\" with a sort of laugh. I was a touch embarrassed, I don't know why, but we just moved on to another conversation.\n\nAnyway, he died suddenly the next morning and I've weirdly always felt happy that he \"caught\" me absorbing who he was. \n\nIt's always a great reminder where we come from. Your father sounds like an amazing human. Wish you best.",

There's a song I still can't listen to without crying, and I can't watch old home videos that have him in them. Most of the stories I have about him are from other people. I take comfort and purpose in knowing he was a good father and a good man. Sounds like yours was too. \nMy heart goes out to you. They say time heals all wounds but i like the ocean analogy better. Grief comes in waves, at first it's like a storm, fast, repetitive waves that crash around you. Over time those waves shrink and slow down but are still there until a monster rogue one knocks you around. I don't think it ever hurts any less, but it gets easier to deal with.",

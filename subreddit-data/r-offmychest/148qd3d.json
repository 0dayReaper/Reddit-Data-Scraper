    "postText": "So, to start off, I started at my new job today. I was really excited because this is my first serious paying job. I had a great day, met a lot of great people. She told me she was gonna pick me up at 5. I was busy, so I was away from my phone.\n\nIt turns out she texted me a bunch of times. I didn\u2019t have my phone, so I didn\u2019t know. I was really happy, and got in her car ready to tell her about my day. She started yelling. Apparently she waited for a long time. She said I was stupid and asked how I couldn\u2019t have known she was coming. I didn\u2019t realize the time.\n\nAll I wanted was to tell her what I did and for her to be happy for me. She\u2019s never happy or proud and she rarely shows me any emotion. I know she\u2019s depressed and she hates her life, but I wish she could give me some kind of affirmation. My awesome day turned horrible in about 3 seconds.",

    "postText": "A couple weeks ago i 15M and some friends decided that to have a sleep over together and drink liquor. It was me, one of my male friends and 5 female friends. One of these girls is a good friend of mine. But i've noticed that she's maybe intrested in more. This time i had drunken a lot. And lost my ability to stand up properly, vomited and eventually fell asleep. I slept like a rock and my friends had put me in a room where i could\nbe by myself. When i woke up in the morning my friend was sleeping in front of me in the same bed. I felt confused but didn\u2019t think much of it. Later on my friend said that she had asked the others where i was and that she had gotten the response that i was sleeping in that room. When my other friend went to check on what was taking so long she was spooning with me. This is where i think i might be overthinking. Because she almost protective of me and tries to get physical contact ever though she knows that i\u2019m extremely uncomfortable with that. Idk maybe i'm just overthinking it but it felt weird knowing that someone that probably has a little crush on me was touching me while i was asleep. Also the fact that she could have done more without anyone knowing. So am i overthinking or not?",

You being asleep isn\u2019t open invitation for a person (drunk or not) to be touching you/spooning you/ literally anything. \nPlease drop this friend, they clearly have no respect for you or your boundaries you\u2019ve set.",

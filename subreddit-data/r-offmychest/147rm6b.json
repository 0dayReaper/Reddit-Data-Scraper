    "postText": "I drive an automatic while my bf drives a manual. He really wants ne to be able to drive his car is ever necessary. So I agreed to let him teach me. Our first few sessions resulted in me being massively frustrated. He would tell me what I needed to do to right as I needed to do it. Like while I'm basically running through the stop sign to tell me how to stop. \n\nSo after our last drive (4 times so far) I found a company that teaches you to drive manuals. I had my first session yesterday. Ngl I learned so much with this teacher than I did with my bf. \n\nMy bf is a great driver but man is he not a good teacher. Our next practice I'm sure will be alot better.",

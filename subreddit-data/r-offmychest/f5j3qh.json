    "postText": "Exactly the way I left it this morning. My bed is still made just like I left it. My food is still in the fridge. I only have to cook for myself so I cook and eat whatever I want while playing my music/podcast as loud as I want it without worrying about bothering someone. I turn on all the lights in the house because I like a bright house and no one complains that it's a bad habit. I can eat in bed with no one telling me that I have to eat at the table. I binge watch my favorite show in bed, late into the night and laugh as loud as I want without fear that I'll wake up my partner. This is what happiness looks like. It feels so good to be myself again.",

When I met my current partner, he would come over often to my apartment where I lived alone and it was pretty well-established early on that this is how I live. He was able to see that and decide if, when we live together if he can handle it. \n\nNow he and I live together and we work in total harmony. It's amazing how being with the right person can make all the difference. I am able to still do my things, have my own time, have my own space...people underestimate the value of \"me time\"",

There have been a couple of people I really enjoyed living with. Over all though, I think living alone is a luxury worth the near poverty line I sometimes almost tread. Lol. I have the best of both worlds. My boyfriend lives down the street and I see him for lunch and dinner and evenings till around 10 to 12 phish. I sleep alone ( he is getting his hands on a new queen sized memory foam mattress any day now as a gift for me. And him ) and I LOVE it. Just me and the pets. Shlub around in pjs, smoke weed, fart loudly and laugh wildly. Snack all night and day, walk around naked with all the blinds closed and lights off. I like to sleep naked under a ton of warm blankets in a cool room, very quiet and dark. I like reading, surfing the net, movies and cooking just the way I like. \n\nNo static at all.",

I don\u2019t ever close ANY of the doors in my apartment, and a lot of the way my place is set up kind of revolves around the fact that I don\u2019t close my doors\u2014I don\u2019t need to.  Any time a guest comes over I have to apologize profusely for how absurdly difficult it is to close my bathroom door.  And it\u2019s all because I put a Squatty Potty in it (it\u2019s a teeny tiny bathroom) I\u2019m just so used to never closing the door.",

In October she quit an amazing job that let her work from home full time, and she was paid quite well. In November, I found out she was cheating on me for two years. In January I found out she was lying to her psychiatrist about everything. This month she decided she's not going to her psychiatrist anymore and stopped taking her medications. Her psychiatrist told me she has BPD.\n\n\nLiving with her is straight up hell, and I can't just divorce her because of her and my stupid religious family, and our Church's stance on divorce.\n\nI'm divorcing her anyway, that's without a doubt, it's just taking more time because of the complicated circumstances.\n\nBut, fuck I wish I could just be free already. I wish I could just do whatever the hell I want without a crazy psychopath making me scared to watch my own shows without being threatened with suicide or some other bullshit.\n\nGod damn man.",

            "comment": "First, let me say thank you for reminding me to be grateful for what I do have. \n\nI\u2019m a definite homebody. Running joke with me and my friends is that if you want me to get out of the house for social purposes, you\u2019ve gotta include food. Otherwise, I\u2019m perfectly content to be at home, watch Netflix, journal, read, make art, cook, and most importantly, just not wearing freaking pants. I\u2019ve been that way since I was a kid. Both the homebody and the casual comfort of semi nakedness thing. However, up until recently, I had always shared the place with someone. Obviously living with family growing up but when I moved out for college, I immediately moved in with my SO. He and I have been together for nearly ten years as of now. Due to a very shitty circumstance(I seriously refer to this as the shituation that my life is in right now), I am currently living alone while still being in a relationship with him. \n\nWhen faced with the realization that I was gonna have to live by myself during this, I was terrified. I hadn\u2019t ever solely supported myself, was incredibly used to not coming home to a perpetually empty place, and especially after living with him for so long (6+ years by the time he went away), was comforted by coming home to his energy no matter what mood he was in. To understand that last part, this is where I mention that I struggle with anxiety. One of the many reasons I love my SO is because he doesn\u2019t set off my anxiety like others have been known to do before. When I\u2019m having an anxiety attack, just being around people is exhausting, no matter who they are. It\u2019s not something that is the fault of others but basically that my brain stops filtering out the general chaos of existing in public and I\u2019m barraged with it. But being around him and his energy doesn\u2019t aggravate that barrage even more. So he\u2019s basically one of the very few people I can actually handle being around when I\u2019m in that frame of mind. He\u2019s a sense of safety and comfort and love that I could never dream of giving back to him but I\u2019m trying my damnedest to do just that. \n\nI\u2019ve now been living on my own for nearly two years. At first, it was daunting of course. By now, I\u2019m used to it though. Due to the shituation, I\u2019ve been prone to get morose about living alone because it\u2019s not the way I envisioned my life looking at 25. Not even close. When I started solely supporting myself, there was a part of me that was super excited about cultivating my own space with no one to tell me no. I didn\u2019t have to worry about him not liking this piece of furniture or wanting to set up the room that way or him hanging up a very creepy picture of a wizard that does the Mona Lisa thing, especially in a high traffic area where I would see it. All. The. Time. But all that still fell short to actually living him ya know? He\u2019s worth all that hassle. And because he is worth it but I can\u2019t have it at the moment, I would (and sometimes still do) spend endless nights wishing I were sleeping next to him on the side of the bed furthest from the door because he wakes up more often than I do to go to the bathroom or get a glass of water. Thankfully though, I can officially say he\u2019s coming home this year. (Squee!)\n\nSo in light of all that, my feelings towards living alone have just been meh. It\u2019s a circumstance that I just had to deal with, suffer through, and come out the other side. But seeing this post, I was reminded of all the little things about living alone that are super great. I don\u2019t have to worry about someone eating my leftovers after I\u2019ve had a long day of wanting to come home and enjoy them. I get to strip on the way to the bedroom as soon as I come home and not deal with the trail of clothes irritating someone else. And I have no one to tell me not to light a billion candles to keep little fires as pets. So thank you internet stranger for reminding me that even in the thick of something extremely shitty and scary and daunting, there\u2019s still something to be grateful for and smile about. I needed that today.",

They have been out for 2 years and I still stand in awe of the silence I forgot I used to have, the privacy, the sheer luxury of having a place with four walls called my own where I dont have to take shit from anybody.  Its rarer than I thought and I still marvel I have my independence and privacy back.  Those four kids love the heck out of me, I still take them to do things which their parent dont have the ability to do such as go carts, ice cream, sports events.  The kids have a surprising understanding of the world around them and are great but I do prefer my four walls of solitude.",

I stayed up late when I wanted to and I went to bed super early without interruptions when I wanted to. I cleaned up my messes right after making them and didn't have to clean anyone else's. I got to masturbate without it turning into foreplay. I got to watch TV in bed. \n\nNGL it was an amazing week to myself. I love my partner, but damn do I cherish these rare periods to be absolutely selfish with my time.",

I'm starting to realize that I just need to live alone to be happy, but that would require a 3rd job, very few days off if any, and not having much money left over at the end of the month. \n\nEverything you describe here just sounds like it would be worth it to me. I'm a homebody and because both of my jobs require constant human interaction and socialization, if I have a night off (or if I'm lucky a full day) I just want my own space.\n\nOur lease is up in June and I'd have to move out of this beloved condo I've been renting for 4 years.

For now, stick to areas that are familiar, and gradually work up to newer areas that require different driving techniques. What's nice about driving now is you can Google map new areas and figure out driving routes and parking situations ahead of time!  Good luck!",

Eventually my dad had enough and said he's paid for me to be insured on his car and I need to get out there and start driving.\nHated it first bc of the nerves but I'm so glad he gave me that little bit of tough love bc now I'm completely fine driving around my area. \n\nIt is a bit nerve-wracking going to new places but it does get easier, I promise you. Just always be safe and aware!",

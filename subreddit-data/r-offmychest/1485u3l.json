    "postText": "26M here. I cant believe it. I honestly will be going homeless in a couple months. I have been working at this fast food place for the past two years. It\u2019s been my only source of income and I lost it over the stupidest thing. I got mad at this customer who kept speaking softly into the speaker post. I eventually yelled at them to get closer and they came inside and called me out for it. Idk what came over me, but it\u2019s over. I lost my job, and I spent so much effort into getting it. I have a criminal record as before I got the job I stole some food from my neighbor because I fking don\u2019t have anything. I had my chance and I blew it. I deserve this. Yea. That\u2019s it.",

There are tons of other jobs out there and your experience over the last two years will help you find a new job. Just put on new applications that you had differing views with your previous job, you'll be fine. There will be someone willing to take a chance on you.",

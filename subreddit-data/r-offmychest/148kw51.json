    "postText": "This happened about 5 years ago but it still bothers me. When I was six years old my mom got a cat from a local animal shelter. This cat was always there no matter what was happening at our house. He was mostly an outdoor cat but still came inside quite frequently. \n\nFast forward 15 years where I'm an adult now. From what I can recall the cat kept getting into my older sister's stuff and was getting visibly annoyed about it. But she decided that \"if it happens again, he's going to the pound\". This had upset me greatly and I made it known to her. But she didn't care. I told her that I was willing to work something out but she didn't want to listen. I also expressed concern for the cat's well being from being outside 24/7 but all she would say is \"he's an animal\".\n\nI even cried to her about it, almost begging for her to not take him away. Buy she just looked at me without a care in the world. Even saying things like \"are you really crying over a cat?\" Eventually she tells me that the reason she was being like that was because he was getting into her work clothes which were hard to clean and not cheap to replace. \n\nMonths later when I brought it up and told she goes \"that was a joke\". And that just didn't sit right with me because what was supposed to be funny about that? When I asked her why she thought that was a joke all she, along with both of my brothers who heard about it, said that \"that's just how we joke around\". \n\nFor a little more context, this cat has been there for me more than my sister has. He was the last thing that reminded me of all the good things from my childhood. There was a lot of yelling between my parents, my dad was an alcoholic, and my mom had a friendof hers live in our house for years (she treated him more like a husband than my dad). There are more things that went on but my memories are very cloudy so I can't go into detail. This cat was a very good source of comfort for me. \n\nBack to my sister now. She said she is sorry but I don't buy it. And I honestly don't see her much as a sister. Because she decided to joke about sending a cat to the pound, I don't see her as sympathetic, compassionate or remorseful. I don't believe that she loves me because if she did she would've seen how upset I was and stopped before things got that far. \n\nIf I'm being honest, I don't think I'll ever let that go. I don't think I can ever fully trust her knowing that she has that kind of humor. And I don't think she'll ever understand that even if I showed her this post. Maybe had she never did that there would be a better chance of us having a decent sibling relationship. Maybe I would actually think of keeping in touch with her when I move away and maybe I would open up to her more. But she ruined that and I don't care to let it go. \n\nEven if I do I can't forget and I am not forgiving. That was not a joke, that was not funny, and that is a hill I will die on.",

            "comment": "I thought you were going to say that she actually took the cat to the pound or at least drove off with it. But she never did? She just said she was going to? \n\nI\u2019ve joked about dropping my kids off in the woods to live with the wolves since they didn\u2019t want to stop acting like wild animals. That doesn\u2019t mean I actually would, it\u2019s a joke. \n\nThere has to be other reasons you resent her, right? Was she cruel in other ways? Are you maybe taking your anger out on her instead of your parents for those miserable years because she\u2019s an easier target or because she unknowingly triggered you and didn\u2019t realize that the cat she resented was your main comfort? Remember that she was also younger and more immature when she said those things, she was also living through the chaos that was your home, the cat you loved created more stress for her at an already stressful time. She had and has her own trauma for that time &amp; she apologized. Did you fully explain to her that living in that situation was really hard for you and the cat was basically the only thing that got you through it and so her joke was incredibly hurtful for you, it made you think that you were going to lose your only form of comfort and that since she was so callous about it, making fun of you for being so attached to it, it made you feel like she didn\u2019t care about you or your pain? Maybe if you open up to her, she will understand &amp; you can repair your relationship.",

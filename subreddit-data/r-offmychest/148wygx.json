    "postText": " I do consider myself lesbian because I\u2019m not emotionally or sexually attracted to actual men and I would never want to have a relationship with one or actually have sex with one. Times I\u2019ve seen male nudity in sex scenes in movies, I\u2019ve skipped it because it makes me uncomfortable. I have never had a crush on a guy, I\u2019ve never even looked at a guy and thought about having sex with him.\nBut sometimes, I get hot about the idea of a dick in me, though I don\u2019t like imagining the actual penis itself and the thought of male orgasms make me puke. It\u2019s just the sensation, or the way I imagine it feeling. I know I\u2019m not the only lesbian who experiences this, because I\u2019ve heard others talk about it.\nIn fact, a lesbian sex book from the 90s says that theoretical sexual attraction to men or het sex can exist among lesbians and doesn\u2019t make them straight since they\u2019d never want to enact that in real life. \n\nIdk. Just wanted to vent. I feel like I could never confess this in real life because these days everyone has to put you in a box. \u2018If you ever felt the slightest bit of attraction to a man you\u2019re bi\u2019, yet most of us young queer people can agree that a straight person having one rogue gay fantasy doesn\u2019t literally make them queer. People would start believing I wasn\u2019t lesbian anymore. \n\nBy the way, to all the guys who are ready to hate, I don\u2019t hate men as people, I\u2019m just really not attracted to them, and I don\u2019t know, their naked bodies aren\u2019t appealing to me and make me uncomfortable. That\u2019s it. Not that deep.",

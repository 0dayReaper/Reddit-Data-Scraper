    "postText": "I am currently growing up in a sort of dysfunctional family. To be direct, I have no one to protect me. My dad does not care, and is often the one starting arguments, and my mom is normally the one escalating these fights. I went downstairs while my mom was drinking to get water. I stayed quiet, and basically just let her scream and shout while i drank my water and looked at my phone. She got mad at me for my phone, so i gave it to her. All I wanted to do is drink water. I finally get so pissed after a while I raised my voice and told her I\u2019ll go up, i\u2019m just getting water. She said i\u2019m awake at this time because I slept all day this morning, I get her anger, but both of my parents are always yelling and screaming and hitting and making me cry. Im so done with both of them never defending me. I feel so miserable. I want to have kids when i\u2019m older, but i\u2019m so scared i\u2019m gonna continue this cycle. I\u2019m already picking up the habit of yelling and getting angry easily. I hate it. I\u2019m not physically violent, but i really cannot control how quickly i get mad. I\u2019m working on it, always apologizing, and making it up to people, but it\u2019s driving me mad thinking abt how i feel like i will be crazy one day. Idk what i mean by crazy, but i\u2019m worried I won\u2019t have control over my own mind and feelings. I\u2019m truly scared I\u2019ll continue what my parents have taught me. I feel like I won\u2019t deserve love because I don\u2019t have anything to give. My parents both grew up with an abusive parent, but they always had the other parent to protect them, and they had many siblings. I\u2019m growing up as an only child because my parents are older than everyone else\u2019s around me and my brother was already capable of taking care of himself by the time i was born. i feel so alone. The only people i have to talk to this about is my friends, I had a friend who was in a similar household, but both of us were too much like our parents, and we were a  horrible pair.  I feel like I have no one to protect or defend me. I feel like It never actually gets better. I want to be close with my family, but I don\u2019t think they like me. My cousins all think of me as spoilt, because i\u2019m the only one who\u2019s mixed so I live in my dads country that happens to be more developed. My aunts and uncles r the only ones who I think cherish me, but i\u2019ve always been scared some of them don\u2019t want to actually have a relationship with me like they do with my other cousins. My parents, they\u2019re not good at parenting, and my brother, while he used to defend me, he\u2019s becoming a third parent as he has kids of own and becomes more irritable, or maybe my mom twists stories for him. I know i may sound like i\u2019m the problem saying not even my own family likes me, and idk i\u2019m just worried. I try hard in school, I am nice to people i see, I help in any way i can even if it means i have to lie to my parents to protect someone else, but i feel like i must\u2019ve done something wrong if this is how I have to live like. If I was a good kid, surely they wouldn\u2019t do this to me. I tried reading other peoples stories, just to see if they could relate in anyway, but I feel alone. I feel as if the world has turned its back on me and left me by myself. I ofc have friends that love me, and i appreciate it deeply, but I just want an adult in my life to protect me. I don\u2019t know what road in life i\u2019ll go down on, I hope it\u2019s one that brings me towards a brighter future where i\u2019m a mother and where i\u2019m loved, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for me. I feel i\u2019ve already learnt too many of their behaviours, and there\u2019s no hope for me. I just want people to comfort me to be honest, I don\u2019t see a way out, but I just want to feel better, and like there\u2019s people on my side.",

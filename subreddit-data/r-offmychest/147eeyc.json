    "postText": "I'm 22 ,male. I know her for 4 years. I'm from poor family and she's from upper middle class family. We both have toxic parents and trying to get freedom. But i worked hard for It everyday, changed my career many times, failed several times in life. I struggle with loneliness and suicidal thoughts, hatred anger and so on.\n\nShe had a much better life compared to me. Dated several boys since her teens, had sex parties clubbing, everything ideal for a teenager in today's society. She always had good food and good clothes. But she is lazy. Never worked hard. Wasted her time watching TV , Instagram or playing games, spending time with her bf.\n\nI developed romantic interest towards her as we shared a strong emotional bond and i felt she understand me and my life. But she rejected me and made me her bestfriend. She always looking for a good looking guy who has a lot of money, car, emotional intelligence.\n\nNow out of nowhere she decided she wants to become a pilot and study in Australia. It's very expensive (50-60k dollar) and want me to pay for her bcos her parents denied. She has a college degree but she don't want to work bcos she thinks she is from superior family and she won't do some low quality job, it will ruin her image in society.  She want a luxurious life to show off to everyone what she's capable of.\n\nI rejected her saying how can you expect me to pay so much money when u rejected me ? U didn't care my feelings, you wanted superficial qualities like good looks and stuff. Go and ask your good looking rich boys to help you. You don't like me as your boyfriend but you sure love my money.  \n              She is giving reason she helped me 100-200$ few times which i returned. So i said i can give a normal amount in name of friendship but 50k dollar ? It's not normal it's so big amount. Why should I give it to you?\n\nNow she thinks I'm cheap, she thought I'm different but I'm just like another man want sex, calling me perv and very rude to me. I'm feeling very confused and guilty. I feel bad she is helpless too but it's her own making. She wants to get everything without any hardwork. I need this money for my family security and i am struggling for years so i have some dreams too. She wants me to delay my dreams bcos i have a lot of time.\n\nShe said if we date or if we have sex it will ruin how she sees me. So i said if i give you money i won't be able to see you the same anymore and friendship will ruin too. So choose you want my money or friendship. She avoided it and didn't choose anything yet.",

If she asks a second time, you leave the room, exit the phone call, etc. \n\nIf you want to end the friendship over that, it would be a reasonable thing to do. Then block her. \n\nAlso, she is never going to be in a romantic relationship with you. If she was interested, she would have been in a relationship with you already. \n\nIf you loan her $100, $1000, $10000, or $60000, you will never see it again.",

If you knew that there are many, MANY men that get worn down by their wives or girl friends to do things they don't want to do. This monster is not even that to you. What makes her a monster is the fact that she would suck you completely dry and not care. And leave you destitute. Test her. Tell her you'll give her the money but it's all you have and it'll leave you with nothing. If she truly cared about you, even as a friend, she would not take that risk with your money.  If she doesn't care about you, she will make promises to pay you back and trust her. If she's confident in making it, she can make the money herself like a normal adult or borrow money like a normal adult.

Infatuation is the drug like hormones of the honeymoon period of falling in love, but without the actual connection or back and forth of actually falling in love.    Infatuation feels *awesome*, but it also hurts because you are putting out all this feeling, but you aren't actually getting anything back.  Ultimately, infatuation is right up there with binge drinking and overeating.  It's something that feels good but is bad for you. \n\n You want to work on grounding yourself and getting away from this feeling, because this woman is toxic.",

    "postText": "This is my first Father\u2019s Day without my dad. It\u2019s been really hard knowing that instead of scrambling for gift for him I\u2019ll be carrying flowers to his gravesite. This year however, my father-in-law who I\u2019ve gotten to grow close with is now in my life and I decided to make him a Father\u2019s Day card. I dabble in water color and decided to make one that looks just like him. He\u2019s bilingual however he is more comfortable speaking Spanish, so I wrote how I felt in the card in Spanish and made sure my partner of course proof read. I won\u2019t see him for the rest of the week because I\u2019m traveling back home, but I will give it to him tonight and tbh I\u2019m nervous. I hope he likes the card. I know it\u2019s not much, but I hope the words inside will be enough for him to know I truly care about him and that I can\u2019t thank him enough for all he has done and for making me feel protected and guided during the loss of my own father. Is there any advice anyone can give me on how to present it, or what to say when handing it to him?",

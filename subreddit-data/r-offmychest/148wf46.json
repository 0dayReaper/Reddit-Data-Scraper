Married, lonely, \u201cin love\u201d,etc I am so bored by the idea of someone just wanting me who isn\u2019t jeporisdising their morals, or something thing that is supposed to be dear to them just to be with me. I can control myself usually but I just started a new medication that makes me insatiable. It feels like when I was a teenager and I\u2019d go for friends crushes, boyfriends, brothers, etc. \n\nIt takes up a lot of my time. It is extremely distracting to feel the need to seduce every \u201cunavailable\u201d man. Even walking down the street I\u2019ll make eye contact with men with their partners, HELP",

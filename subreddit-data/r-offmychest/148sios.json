    "postText": "\nI (m22) was cruising around at night today when I saw a car behave in a very weird manner and I decided to pull up next to them after driving behind them for like 20 minutes, I told her to please pull over what she actually did, i told her how dangerous all that was and asked wtf was going on, after talking for a few minutes she said (I'm getting beat at home dude!)\nI didn't want to call the cops on that woman right then and there she had childrens seats on her rear seats and already has a tough time, she works as a nurse which I have massive respect for, and I usually have no respect for any drunk drivers but she was sobbing so much after she opened up a bit more about the abuse she suffers at home, she told me that she doesn't care about dying anymore and other pretty vile stuff.\nHer partner takes all her money, she works extra shifts and all that stuff (probably bc the partner tells her to), she wanted my phone number because she wanted to meet up with me which i declined but I took hers (so I had a way to contact her when she's sober)\n\nI've offered her to drive her home, which she declined because her partner would beat her if the car wasn't home, she also declined for me to drive her home in her car and I would've actually taken the 45 minute walk back to my car, in the end i reluctantly had to let her drive off with me following behind and she arrived home safely, I hate that I let her drive off but I couldn't call the cops on her and put her at risk of getting beat or losing her job she doesn't deserve all that\n\nWhat can I do to help? How can I interfere? I'm not willing to show up at their house and potentially get murdered by some maniac with a massive family but I have her number, her name, and i believe her address, I think I will call her through a phone booth tomorrow when she's sober because I don't want my number in her phone and potentially have my identity revealed to some eastern clan. I'm out of my depth here, the way she hugged me just broke my heart I could really sense that she was seeking shelter but it's all so messed up.",

Maybe they could investigate further, and potentially provide some help to that poor lady.\nBut kudos on you for your empathy, kindness and conern towards the woman.",

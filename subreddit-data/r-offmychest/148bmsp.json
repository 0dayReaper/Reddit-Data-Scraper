    "postText": "Hey everyone, I (15M) love my parents so, so much. In my eyes, there is nothing more important than them. I have also tried my best to forge a positive, and healthy relationship with them. I have been so blessed to be born in such a loving family, and that is what I treasure the most in my life. There are some days that I just cry in the shower because of how grateful I am.\n\nCut to the juicy part, my parents are heavy, heavy smokers. They smoke at least 4-5 times a day. I don't know what to do, I keep seeing these ads or posters outside or online on how smoking shortens life spans and introduces health complications. I really do not want them to die early. I had this dream where my Mom had only 6 months to live and I was just devastated. I am scared to death for that to happen in real life.\n\nMy parents try to cover up that they smoke, telling me, from young, that they had to go out for a coffee break. I quickly realised that they went out to smoke...\n\nIn around last December, I mustered up the courage to ask my Mom whether she smokes or not, hopefully able to have a conversation about this. But she said \"No\" and I chickened out of the entire thing. I am 99% sure she smokes as we have a drawer full of cigarettes at home and she has these \"coffee\" breaks too.\n\nIn other people's eyes it is probably easy to just confront my parents and ask them to quit smoking, after all we have a healthy relationship. But I don't know, something about asking them is so scary. I am scared that they will get mad at me, sever the relationship I have with them, or just make them feel so bad about themselves. I want to tell them how I feel right after we come back from a holiday at around 23 Jun. I do not know what to do.",

Making arguments out of it isn't recommended, but just make them aware, they're adults with free will, change doesn't happen overnight.",

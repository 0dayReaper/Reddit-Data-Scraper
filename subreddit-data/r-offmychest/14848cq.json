    "postText": "I (25 m) have been talking to a girl (29 f) for 7 months. We started off as friends although I made my intentions clear after our first day out together that I like her. She said we\u2019ll go with the flow and see. \n\nAfter an amazing day out with her recently where I felt we were getting much closer, I confess and say I\u2019d be interested in officially dating her. She told me she cannot reciprocate feelings because she isn\u2019t over her Ex one bit and is still hurt and still loves him. She broke up a year ago, so I thought she would be emotionally available but I understand \ud83d\ude14\n\nNow only a few days later we planned a mini-trip to a neighboring city and are spending the night together in a single room airbnb and decided to share a bed for that night (despite never spending the night with each other before hand)\n\nThat leaves me here\u2026 I\u2019m confused and honestly obsessed with her. I know I should probably stop talking to her if I want to be more than friends, but some stupid part of me thinks that maybe it\u2019ll still develop into something. Being lonely probably makes these thoughts 1000x more prevalent. Not sure if I should have even accepted the mini-trip or how to proceed at all honestly, i\u2019m lost and stressed. Regardless, thanks everyone :(",

Rejection alone is enough to make someone withdraw, but you two are about to be in the same bed after she turned you down. I don't think that's remotely necessary or appropriate, it's messy and doesn't make sense and I find it offputting that she would agree to that. It's giving you the wrong signals and the impression that she's more into you than she said.",

It's okay to be friendly but I  would strongly avoid any physical contact with her. She needs to understand that what she's doing here is totally inappropriate and irresponsible, but you can't feed into it, either. After confessing how you felt for her, she gave you the impression that she wanted to see how things would go, which is understandable, but also signifies that she was interested in some sense as well, but still rejected you after you patiently waited and let your feelings for her fester over time. She could have told you about her ex from the beginning so that you could maintain the friendship and also keep your options open and meet other people. She plays a massive role here. If she's being honest with you, it sounds like her ex is a mental and emotional constant for her and I would do anything in my power to not overstep.",

She knew that I liked her but pretended that she didn't know and I ended up confessing my feelings to her when I was drunk. She explained to me that she didn't feel the same and that she had a boyfriend but the thing is, when I started liking her she was single but deep down she always still had feelings for her ex which is why I accepted it was just a situation in love I wasn't going to win. \n\nYou win some you lose some my dawg.",

I actually contemplated jumping into the nearest lake just to stop myself feeling pain but I prevented myself thinking that my family really cares about me and I will find the one ! I was seriously thinking about suicide there and then after she rejected me because I really was in love with her and I was so far gone. \n\nLove is like that. I would have preferred being in a relationship with her than no relationship at all. At the same time, I have a very strong feeling that things aren't going to work out with her BF because she has a long history of getting with people and breaking up with them. It still hurts but it gets better dawg.",

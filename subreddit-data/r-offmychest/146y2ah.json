    "postText": "I am horrified. \nAbout a month ago I was in the bathroom with the shower running. I however was not in the shower but in fact kneeling on the floor of the bathroom self-pleasuring l by riding a hairbrush. It\u2019s the only way I can have privacy in this house - or so I thought. \n\n\nMy family is very open and have no boundaries so a locked door does not deter. Whilst I was riding away there was a knock at the door, my name was called, and to my horror THE DOOR QUICKLY UNLOCKS AND SWINGS OPEN. \nI scream - flip around and slam the door in his face - hairbrush still inside me - My brother staring at me whilst holding a butter knife. \n\n\nThank goodness I was facing away from the door at the time but just imagine his POV - his fat ass sister kneeling butt ass naked on the floor. I don\u2019t know what he saw but I assume he didn\u2019t see anything too scarring - he saw my naked cheeks and that\u2019s it.\nI then try to play it off as me shaving my coochie to my brother and to my mum when my brother then brings it up later that day. Great, they\u2019ve bought the lie, I\u2019m in the clear right? Tonight I realised I probably am very wrong about that conclusion.\n\n\nTonight whilst we are all chilling in the sitting room I ask my family where my missing back scrubber was (100% sure it was my other brother who steals everyone\u2019s stuff for his projects) when my little brother says \u201cis it the one you use to shove up your\u2014-\u201c my mum immediately cuts him off and he just stares at my mum. \n\n\nI take a moment to process what he says. Why on earth would he ever joke about that unless he\u2019s seen that before, and why would my mum just shut down the conversation instead of telling him off for being so vulgar. It could only be because my brother had come to discuss what he had witnessed with my mother. Therefore at least one of them is aware I self-pleasure and one is going to have an awful realisation when they grow up. \n\n\nI hate that my brother had to witness that and I feel so gross about it. I\u2019m mortified. My religion is very against self pleasure. My mother is aware I have needs as I lived with an ex-partner for over a year and I\u2019ve told her what cause me to \u201csin\u201d in the first place (AKA girl wanted to get dicked down). But regardless anything sexual is a big no. \n\n\nSo my mum knows I self-pleasure and exactly how I do it. I will never forget tonight or the original event. I\u2019m mortified. It\u2019s so embarrassing. Not only because my mum knows but that my poor brother had to witness and process that. \n\nThanks for listening.",

It didn't matter if I was just using the bathroom or showering. It didn't matter if I had only been in there a minute or 15. They would just bust in. I'm a very private person anyhow, plus I have complex PTSD from sexual abuse so it used to instantly terrify me and sometimes send me into flashbacks when that door slammed open with no warning. I never felt safe while in the bathroom unless I was home alone, which was extremely rare. I would skip out on fun stuff with family just so I could take a shower in peace without fear of someone using a butter knife to open the lock. I grew to hate showering and saw it as a chore if anyone else was home. Now I'll gladly take long baths or just enjoy showers. My mother once accused me of hiding something because I instantly grabbed a robe while soaking wet without even drying off because she busted in, it was \"suspicious\" because I didn't want her staring at my naked body at 17 years old. Crap like that and what OP is going through happens when family has no boundaries or don't respect each other. I won't even go into the bathroom while my husband is showering without knocking first to ask permission even though he's never once told me no. When we discussed kids one of the things I brought up was actually bathroom privacy for all parties because I never want to live like that again (outside of when a kid is really little since that's just normal little kid behavior) .",

And 12 yrs OLD\u203c\ufe0f If you're too stupid to understand when you hear a shower running AND the door's locked not to take it upon yourself to unlock it??? That's ONE THING\u203c\ufe0f But you know it's occupied and simply have no respect for anyone or their boundaries??? Idgaf HOW old you are. You gotta GO. Out my life. You get as little interaction as possible. And being born into Christianity until just a few years ago when I finally started to realize it's complete bullshit after 27 fucking YEARS. My mother would shame me in anyway she could for anything sexual and it really fw my confidence but now??? I wish she would say something. I'd just look at her. Like \"okay? \ud83e\udd78\" Bc I'm grown, I do what makes me happy now, and I don't live for anyone but ME from this point on. And OP tbh I kinda wanna tell you to say you were desperate &amp; got a tampon stuck?? bc I KNOW how it feels to be shamed for having very human and basic desires but coming from a person who spent 27 years of life being traumatized by somebody else's (my parents) bullshit beliefs??? And shamed for things that are perfectly normal desires?? The sooner you realize it's all man-made bullshit that as a woman first and foremost was not in any way made for you or with you in mind?? The sooner you can start loving yourself for everything you are. Womanhood included. Being your OWN person who doesn't owe anyone else an explanation for what you desire to do to YOUR body included. And you don't sound like you're ready for that. You don't sound like you're ready to let those beliefs go. You sound like you just want a solution for your folks to shut up &amp; stop looking at you as an outsider right now. But the truth is they're not going to. My mother looked at me the same when she found out I was doing it in hs. And that I was talking my bf kinda spicy otp. I hated that she found out. It was dreadful. Bc I knew being \"Christian\" she was going to shame me for it and look down on me from that point on. But these days I'm glad. Bc she pushed me away &amp; when everyone (family mostly) around you is a \"believer\" and does the same when they find out your (very normal) \"SiNs\" and you have no one but (friends you've chosen) and yourself?? You have people to make you feel good and love you for who you are and don't have to hide parts of yourself or who you are??? I PROMISE you it's the most freeing thing throughout the entire universe but you don't wanna take the leap into the unknowns of life sometimes and that's perfectly understandable but I can't say it's okay. Bc it's NOT. It's not okay for your mental health. It's not okay for your confidence. And it's not okay for your future self. Your children. And anyone who might look up to you and see you subjected to beliefs that genuinely mean you no good. Particularly as a woman. And for me twice over as bisexual. I hated myself for a long long LONG time. I haven't even officially come out the \"closet\" bc I was so ashamed for it growing up in that but now??? It wouldn't bother me if my mother ever even alluded to know. Although I know she knows. I'm not ashamed for being who I am anymore - I don't need to make an ANNOUNCEMENT bc it's nobody's fucking busines - or having the parts I was born with. The very parts these \"men\" come from. The men that disgusting trash ass pedophile version of a \"god\" was made for. I know you might not wanna hear anything other than how to make it go away??? But for your future, self-confidence, mental health, and children(if those are in the cards for you) I so so so so so so HOPE you do. Solely as a woman. It's hard sometimes when you grew up with mostly only friends that believed in a certain way to have to risk letting those friendships go. I lost my former best friend when I told him I didn't follow that anymore. Didn't even call me for my birthday. It hurt. But even more than that I was angry. Bc I don't allow myself to get close to very many so those that I do??? Mean a lot to me. But if the connection doesn't give room for you to be yourself having done harm to no one??? And simply experience life?? Leave. And go where you're cherished. Idk you but as a woman who's been raised in trauma under the guise of good clean religion as opposed to simple morals and striving for better civilization??? I love you. You probably didn't want to hear any of that. I didn't either but I wish someone would've been there to tell me. So so much. Bc I had no one to do so. I had to realize it on my own.",

I suggest maybe actually buying a gift along with the toy just so you can have something in the box once you seal it up again and wrap it (just so there's not an empty box sitting there where someone can pick it up and actually feel that it's empty). It'll go better with the story too when you finally give it to someone (just be sure to shred and throw away the invoice inside!)\n\nMaybe this is overthinking things but that's just kind of how you learn to think as you grow up in these kinds of households.

It helps a lot now when I am alone in my room or the bathroom etc. as I can have some privacy and feel a lot safer and can prevent accidents like this from happening. I also try to be as quiet as I can. \n\nYou don't need to discuss anything explicit with your parents if you don't feel comfortable, but try to show that you want some basic privacy when needed, and close/lock the door whenever possible.

So that can be hard to fully grasp especially if he\u2019s not taught how important it is to give ppl (women especially) their privacy. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I\u2019d be standing up for myself by showing him how it feels to be embarrassed and/or talking him down like he tried to do to you. \nIt\u2019s disgusting and misogynistic to shame a woman for that. It might be just a sibling thing, but still that needs to be corrected. \n\nLastly, try not to be ashamed at all. I get it\u2019s embarrassing but literally it is a very normal thing to do. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have opened the friggin door, you little stain. You saw what you saw and it\u2019s not my fault you don\u2019t know how to respect a woman\u2019s privacy!\u201d Something like that. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the discomfort this experience caused.

Get at least three bolts each installed on your bathroom door and your bedroom door, facing the inside of course.\n\nFFS (or FGS or FPS) you're 25. Your right to privacy should have started at 16. Don't buy into the whole \"we're an open family, no locked doors in our house\" bullshit. I don't care what your religion says. BATHROOM PRIVACY IS A HUMAN RIGHT. What you do in there is none of God's business.\n\nPS: Two bolts on each door should be enough. Top and bottom. Get them with a screwdriver or drill at a hardware store. It's easy to install or just ask a handyman for help. They also have references for that at the hardware store.",

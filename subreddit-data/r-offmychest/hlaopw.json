It's a tradition, and there were always lots of other people there doing the same. Someone with a decent car stereo would tune into the local radio station to play the synched-up soundtrack to the show. \n\nIt got to be showtime, and someone cranked up the volume. A radio host was just finishing wishing everyone a happy and safe 4th, the first big firework went off, and the music started: \n\nGary Jules' Mad World. \n\nIt was fucking surreal. We all sat there, watching a brilliant display of lights and colors and bangs, listening to this absurdly sad song with a seemingly profound message about the state of our country in 2019. What genius heretic got away with this decision? \n\nAbout halfway through the song, they switched to the correct station, which was playing a run-heavy version of God Bless the USA, followed by more patriotic and upbeat songs. \n\nThat first impression lasted.",

That's what sets America apart from even other parts of the West.\n\nGenerational divides due to an increase in this mindset only makes it worse. People realizing just how much the people before them screwed them over fiscally, governmentally and environmentally. And they turn around and are mad at the younger generation for having the audacity to be mad that they've given them a dying planet. I think a lot of it all has to do with drugs like Lipitor. Before, the people we're all mad at now would have been dead by now, due to heart disease. But now they're still around, still able to vote regressively on a number of issues in their selfish way and they're here to witness just how much the younger generations hate them for it.\n\nI realize a lot of this is mass generalizations and I sort of went off topic but I'm just thinking as I'm typing.",

Love my country but am concerned about how quickly 35%-40% of it have embraced very undemocratic beliefs and formed what, from the outside, looks like a cult of personalty around a former reality show host.  How they mentally get around the obvious nepotism (unelected Jared Kushner is the 2nd most powerful person in the US), direct and easily provable lying to their faces about all sorts of things both important and not, and constant authoritarian chest puffing is hard to understand.  Grew up around right wing folks and would have thought they hate these things.  It's what they once feared would happen on a conceptual level, it's just now being done by someone on their \"team.\" \n\nI'd like to think folks are waking up now.  Tired of politics in this country being a like a sport with home fans who root for their team no matter how horrible they are.",

Less than a decade ago, back when the American president was a black man, a twelve year old boy was killed for having a toy gun, but a man shooting up a black church got to eat Burger King. The only reason it's as bad as it is now is because Trump made it easier to do it all openly. But what's happening today, it was inevitable. It's no individual man's fault.\n\nYour shame and desire for a better, fairer USA makes you more of a patriot than the waving of a thousand flags ever could. Your people are your country; not some patterned cloth, not some borders in the sand, and not some paper with pretty words written on it. \n\nMy friend, right now the Nation you swore an oath to protect is under siege by enemies, and these enemies are wearing many different uniforms: cop uniforms, business suits, and white robes. They besmirch the flag you swore allegiance to, and they spit on the soil you grew up on. My question is: what will you do about it?",

It\u2019s hard for me to think about being patriotic when it feels like the meaning of patriotism is being twisted to serve a political agenda. \n\nBut it gives me hope that there are so many others that recognize something isn\u2019t right. If we recognize and acknowledge something is wrong, we can start to take steps to mend it and to build something better.\n\nThis year, instead of setting off fireworks, I\u2019m studying. I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019ve been a part of what has led the country down this road. For far too long I was ignorant to how important my thoughts, voice and vote was. I didn\u2019t participate in conversations because I didn\u2019t know enough but also didn\u2019t take the steps I needed to to learn.  I will no longer allow that to happen. \n\nI may not be proud that I\u2019ve allowed myself to not take a more active role in this country but I can\u2019t change that past. I can, however, make this an opportunity to change the future. \n\nWe all have a chance to make a change. To help build a better, stronger, more united nation. To help build something all American people can be proud of so we never have to feel this way on the fourth again. All of you commenting on this post have already started to by caring. \n\nThank you for caring.",

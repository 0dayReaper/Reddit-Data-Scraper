    "postText": "My guy friend and I were pretty drunk, saw each-other at the club, and ended up hooking up that night. He texted me the next day, confessing he has feelings for me but doesn\u2019t have the time to pursue anything right now (he works 7 days a week over the summer). It was then I realized I might have feelings back. I never saw him in that way until that night\u2014 we met because we were neighbours, and had both moved to a new city where we knew nobody. We were mostly there to support each-other like family; drives to the hospital, emotional support, maintenance; a beer or two on the weekends. I saw him as family, at the time, genuinely. But now that I\u2019ve seen him romantically, I can\u2019t unsee it. \n\nHe\u2019s amazing. We\u2019ve hooked up a few more times since, but you can tell it means more to the both of us\u2026 it\u2019s all so intimate. It\u2019s crazy. This guy i\u2019d never even think about in that way, and now suddenly I\u2019m crazy for him. And now I think back on all the things he\u2019s done for me\u2026 he\u2019s been there for me through so much, he\u2019s supported me no matter what, when clubbing with our friends, he always made sure I was safe and got home safe, and I genuinely cared about this guy so much. He confessed he\u2019s liked me for a while, and I wish I\u2019d known sooner. \n\nI\u2019m not sure where this is going to go. If I end up falling too hard for him, I\u2019m going to cut things off fwb wise. But for now, I\u2019m just starting to catch feelings, and I\u2019m here for some summer fun :)",

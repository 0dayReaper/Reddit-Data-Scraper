    "postText": "Hello po. I just wanted po ask for some advice. So my boyfriend and I, mejj matagal na po kami. Also, we have been through a lot. Pero good thing, okay naman po kami kasi napag-uusapan. There's just this issue lang na when it comes to sexual stuff.\n\nI was raised in a conservative family. I believe sa marriage before sex. And until now, hindi ko pa rin naibibigay sa kanya 'yon. I know he will not forced me to do it but he's being cold saying \"he's like that\" lang. Kaso nabbother lang ako kasi feel ko ayun na lang lagi yung magiging problema namin.\n\nPlease give me an advice po :(",

    "postText": "As of lately I have been so annoyed of everyone. To the point I want to lock myself in the basement for a few days. But at the same time I feel alone. I want to be alone but I feel alone. It dosnt make sense. Everything my family does is making me frustrated even though they are doing nothing different from before. I don't understand why I'm like this suddenly. I am not sure what to do. Do I lock myself in my room? Do I not? I'm confused",

I lock myself in my room, either don\u2019t talk to anyone at all because they\u2019ve all \u201cpissed me off\u201d and I \u201chate them\u201d or I just end up being really mean and snappy. \n\nIt might be something you want to look into, or if anything I hope it reassures you that you\u2019re not the only person in the world who can get like that :)",

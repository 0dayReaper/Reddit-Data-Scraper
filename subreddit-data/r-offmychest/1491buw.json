    "postText": "Short disclaimer I apologize if this is hard to read, Im having troubles concentrating and haven't slept a lot.\n\n 19m and my story isn't as rough and heart tarring as others but it sure got me in a place where I don't know where to go.\n\nI'm writing this out to clear my mind and hoping to grow new roots to heal.\n\nIt all started in Oktober Last year.\n\nI was over at a friend's house, him and I just wanted to chill and catch up because we don't see each other offen.\nHe asked me if a friend of his can come over because she just gone through an breakup and she didn't want to be alone.\nI knew her and the guy who broke up with her.\nI wouldn't have called him a friend but as you gonna find out I was heavily mistaken in that.\nThe three of us spend the night just talking and smoking Pod. \n\nAfter that night I texted her telling her that if she needs anything she can hit me up. My intentions were to help her heal. We got closer, met Up a couple of times, went to the movies, celebrated Halloween together etc.\n\nIn November she got called out by her landlord that she needs to move out because the building is getting torn down.\nAt that time she had some family problems, so she couldn't go back to them. She didn't had a lot of money so she couldn't just go and get a new apartment that she was able to afford.\nI on the other hand was pretty stable in life at that time and offered her to live with me till she found a place. Before I saw it coming I fell in love with her.\nShe is this beautiful 19 year old which got heavily miss treated in her past relationships. I felt her pain and wanted to see her pretty smile again.  I didn't want to make a move because I knew that it's just not the right time so i focused on helping her out of her tricky situation. After about 2 weeks living with me she made a move tho and we started to get close in a relationship kind of way. We started to treat us as if we were in a relationship, she asked me if I wanted to go on promp with her, she wanted to go on dates. \nEnd of December it somehow leaked to her ex and he called me. Telling me how a terrible friend I was and calling me all sort of words. At that time I was able to get her a shared place and asked if could talk .\nI got to her, crying and telling her that I feel bad with what we do. I felt bad because I didn't see the friendship him and I had as such .\nAfter around 10 talking to her she made the conversation about her. I just wanted to vent and wanted some closure, to na\u00efve to understand that it effects her too. In the rage of the moment I called her selfish. She never let that one go and from that time forward everything started to fall apart. We still met each other everyday and tried to build something that would last or at least i did. After her school year was mostly over I took her to a place she wanted to for years now, or so she told me. We went shopping and had a great time, it's been a while since I saw her happy after the call I got from her ex and I was hopeful that everything will get better .\nFast forward and many many fights later, to about 2 month's ago she told me that she wanted to open our relationship. I was strictly against it but told her that id be willing to try. According to her we never were together, she never wanted to be in a relationship with me officially but I treated it as such. My condition was that I just wanna know when she hooked up with someone. She insisted that she called before but I knew that that wouldn't work and that I'd be fine knowing afterwards too because in the heat of the moment I don't think one would think about someone else. She didn't hooked up with someone but occasionally went to a mutual friend of ours. I don't think anything happend but at that time I was thinking about it a lot. At that time she became nearly impossible to read. She didn't involve me in her Problems no more, she didn't told me what made her happy or how she felt. Everything I said she took offensively. I didn't knew what to do so about a month ago I told her that I didn't felt loved anymore. I gave her 3 days to think about what she wanted. If i was the right guy for her and that if she wanted to leave that I would let her go without a fight because I still want her to just be happy. Don't get me wrong I wasn't the perfect guy, I don't really get feelings, I have a weird way looking at the world and she figured it all out according to her. So we had lots of fight's. But after that 3 days she came back and told me that's she wanted me, that she believes that we can work out. Nothing changed tho. To be honest it got worse after that. We met up once after that .\nI had a rough time, my start-up failed and my partner ditched me, I had to go to school in which I'm terrible at, my boss is trying to kick me out and so I got drunk one day with a couple of friend's of mine. We also took a few other things but it ultimately ended in me hooking up with someone. I didn't enigited it but I went with it. I felt wanted, loved which was something I didn't felt for moths at that point. After 30 seconds were nothing really happend I stopped because it didn't felt right.\nI wasn't into it, not at all. I stopped appolegized and got up to call her and tell her what happend.\nThat was around 3 weeks ago.\nI didn't really hear from her since then.\nShe wrote me a lot of messages where she called out all the things that were wrong with me, telling me how much I've hurt her. I wanted to meet up with her so we can talk this through. I feel like a cheater. I feel so dirty and filthy.  I wanted to talk to her in person but that got declined everytime.\n\nI miss her a lot and for all that it's worth that wasn't worth it at all. I'm trying to give her space and honer that she needs time to think but it hurts a lot.\nI've seen her twice with some new friends she made while we didn't had contact. She seems happy and I'm happy that she is but it breaks me that I can't talk to her. For the past 3 weeks I've fallen into a depression. I can't really sleep and got to a point where I got and constant following chest pain that doesn't go away. \n\nI hope that she's doing better then I am.\nI hope that she is able to deal with it better then I do.\nAll I know is that she puts me on a shelf with her former exs. Which cheated on her without them having an open relationship, which did some terrible things to her .\nI do the same, I fell as if I am as bad of a person then them but at the same time I don't get her.\nWith them she stayed for month's after she found out and even tried to build there relationship stronger after she found out what her exs did but she leaves me in the dirt and doesn't even talk.\n\nI know this seems so pitty what I'm doing rn but I just needed to tell someone.\nI miss her s lot and would do anything to make it better or at least get some more information as of where we stand now. Even if in an open relationship this wasn't worth it at all. Next week it's going to be a month and I don't believe that she'll reach out. My father adviced me not to reach out to her either. \nBut I miss her a lot. \nI hope you are doing alright and if our paths won't cross in the future I hope that you'll find happiness on your path of life.",

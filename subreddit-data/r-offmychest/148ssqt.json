    "postText": "I decided to come off of my antidepressant meds a while ago and a couple of months later I met my current boyfriend and have never been happier. But I still hate myself and a big reason for it is because I am so emotional and sensitive. I HATE it so much because I know I\u2019m being irrational, I am very self-aware of my own feelings and I try to intellectualise things and work through my thoughts step by step, but no matter what I do I can\u2019t help but just feel unbearably upset over trivial things that don\u2019t matter. My boyfriend is amazing, but he is a very honest and put together kind of man. I like it of course, but sometimes I can\u2019t help but dwell on the implications of his words even though I know he meant what he said and nothing more nor less. I know it\u2019s part of my mental illness that I see the worst in everything, but I am so sick and tired of it. \nBasically, my medication made me numb- I never felt angry (I hate my temper), I was calm and didn\u2019t care so much about anything. I don\u2019t want to go back on them because I\u2019m not in a terrible state anymore and I never laughed or anything when I was on them, but there is part of me that does want to take them again . I don\u2019t want to ruin this healthy relationship I\u2019ve found with my stupid sensitive brain - I\u2019m sick of ruining our time together because I get hung up on one silly little comment that wasn\u2019t even bad; I just took it that way. I just don\u2019t want to take things to heart anymore and therapy has never worked for me. What do I do? How do I become more stoic and emotionless?",

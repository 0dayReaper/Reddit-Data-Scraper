    "postText": "I just received the news that my aunt passed from stage 4 cancer. I'm fucking speechless. She lives a few hours from me, so I never got a chance to make it down to say goodbye. Even with the distance, she still made every effort to be a part of my family's lives. The only family member on my dad's side that ever kept any real connection. I can't....... I can't fucking believe that she's actually gone. Last time I talked to her was a month ago, she said she was looking forward to seeing us. She asked what my birthday was (never could remember the date, but always the month and year). A normal fucking conversation!!!! \n\nAnd now she's gone. I have no words. This is the third death that Ive experienced in my family, but the first one that I feel I was close to. Any advice to help deal with the coming days and weeks would be appreciated, but don't tell me that she's in a better place. I already know that, but I don't want to think about that too much, might drive me crazy.",

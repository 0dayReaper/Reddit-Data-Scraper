    "postText": "Throwaway account here.\n\nBackground info: I (16m) live in an apartment with my family. We have a neighbor named Angela (31f) (everyone just calls her \u201cAngie\u201d). Angie is so cute and so kind to everyone (including me), and I think I\u2019m in love with her.\n\nAngela is very athletic, and she runs every other day. Her running route is always the same, and I know it sounds so creepy, but sometimes I low-key stalk her on my bike while she\u2019s running (my parents have no clue about this hobby of mine). Every time she goes out running, she wears skimpy clothes that leave her half-naked, like sports bras and tank tops and that sorts of stuff, so I always love catching the eye-candy. I just can\u2019t help myself.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, Angela went out for her run as usual. She was dressed in nothing but very short shorts and a low-cut, spaghetti strap tank top that left nothing to the imagination, and I was so horny and turned on by her and I decided that I wanted to play a prank on her. Part of her run involves her running on a trail, and there is a very big tree that she always passes by. So I got on my bike and hid behind the tree and waited until I heard Angie come, and then I tripped her. She screamed as I tripped her, which I guess should\u2019ve been a warning to me. While she was on the ground, I got on top of her and said enthusiastically \u201cguess who it is?!?!?!??!!\u201d I shoved my hands down her tank top and felt up her body. I meant for it to just be a funny prank, but as soon as I got on top of Angela, she started screaming and crying. She tried pushing me off while I was feeling her body up, but I was stronger than her and I kept touching her and let her know that it was just me, her neighbor. The problem was that she was crying so hard that it actually made me feel so bad for her, so eventually I got off of her and was wondering what on Earth my next steps should be. Angela was so scared that she actually hugged me and wouldn\u2019t let go of me. However, she was so sweaty and she was covering me with her sweat and tears, so I had to push her off. Every time I pushed her off, she whimpered and tried grabbing onto me again, but soon she just stopped. Eventually, somehow, I managed to calm her down enough to get her to stand up, and we walked back to our building together. But she kept crying during our entire walk, and she glued on to me and wouldn\u2019t let go of my arm. Poor thing. I felt way too bad for her.\n\nI have been worried sick about Angie ever since then. While I was at the trail, touching Angela, I was recording my little prank so that I could share it with my friends, but I decided to delete that video. Last night, I went to her apartment and knocked on the door. When she opened the door and saw me standing there, she just started crying and said \u201coh my god, please\u201d and shut the door.\n\nI believe that I am young enough to own this mistake, and make up for it. If I go visit Angela again, will she break down crying once more? How long will it take for her to remember that she is safe with me?\n\nAlso want to add that I am aware of \u201cconsent\u201d and all that jazz. I\u2019ve seen all the PSAs. But I just thought to myself \u201cit\u2019s only a little touching, how bad could it hurt?\u201d It\u2019s not like I was trying to seriously harm Angela or anything. I had no bad intentions.",

I actually don't have any advice because there is nothing you can do for her now.\n\nIn some crazy world there could be restorative justice involved. But that's incredibly unlikely.\n\nGo see a therapist immediately.\n\nDon't ever touch anyone without their consent.\n\nPhysical pranks aren't funny to anyone.",

You act like she should be totally OK with being sexually assaulted just because she knows you. Do you not understand that actually makes it worse? You you need to go to therapy. Honestly, you need to go to jail.",

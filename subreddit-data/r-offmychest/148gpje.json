    "postText": "I keep on sleeping more than enough and when I wake up I still think that I need to sleep. I just don't feel happy about living at all. It feels like I'm serving my karma as punishment. Life doesn't taste so good at all. Right now, it feels bland and bitter. Even though I have so much tasks to do, I just don't feel like doing anything. I want to become a potato.\n\nWhen I feel down, I sleep. And mostly I really feel so down. It's a fucked up cycle I need to get out. But I don't know what to do.",

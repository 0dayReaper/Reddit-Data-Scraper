    "postText": "She did this because she thinks I'm an abusive person but I broke up with her because I couldn't take the fact that I wasn't allowed to work extra to provide for the family. She only wanted me to work around her schedule and forced me to be the only one to take care of the kids the majority of the time. I broke up with her in December because she would constantly snoop around my things trying to find evidence of me being a cheater but was always unsuccessful so she'd start arguments about me talking to my female coworkers about shift trading or about advice for moving up at my job. Ofc wed argue and sometimes it would get very bad but I never physically did anything to her to hurt her. She would sometimes even start calling me names like disgusting and fat or ugly for no reason in the middle of our arguments. \nWhen I left her it was because she could not be accountable for her actions and would always pin them on me. \n\nAfter I broke up with her, she would call me names constantly and say things like \"she hopes I die\" or \"if I killed myself no one would care\" or she'd try to make me out to be a bad father. She did all of this while I was still helping her with the kids because I am not an absent father or and abusive father who would just walk out of my kids life. She refused to let the kids go over to my friend's house where I was living and would want me to take them to school and bring them back from school. \n\nI gave her money, over 5,000 dollars to be exact and when January of this year came around she put me on child support after we had sex because she wanted me to be with her and I just couldn't see change in her. \n\nAt the end of January was when I realized that I should make things work with her so that way I can be a better person and be with my kids more and she agreed. \nWe were working things out and talking more and trying to figure it out for 2 months. Then she hung out with her coworkers for the first time and after that night she did not want to be with me anymore. She only wanted me for her advantage and wanted me to live with her without us being together. \n\nI tried everything I could to be with her. And when she refused to be with me and work things out I did want to kill myself because it hurts being in the same house with my family and us not being a family. \n\nI had to move out again and live with my parents for a little bit, And I have my kids 80% of the time mind you. I'm still on child support and I have to pay over 1,000 a month for it because she said I was absent to their lives. I have arranged a court hearing for this so that way I could be removed or have to pay a reduced child support payment. \n\nShe keeps asking me to help her but I can't help her because I'm not working a good paying job and I'm already a month behind on payments because I haven't been able to pay much due to having the kids a lot and no babysitter. \n\nRecently I decided to cut everything off from her and when I did she has been acting very disrespectful to me. She throws in my face constantly that she doesn't want to be with me, she calls me a horrible father, she never comes to an understanding of how hard it's been for me. \n\nToday she posted pictures of our arguments during the bad points all over social media and calls me a narcissist for it but she never takes accountability. \nHer coworkers are influencing her to do this and encouraging her behavior right now. \n\nAll I want is for her to realize that this shit is not okay and that she can't post to social media my business all because she's mad I won't do anything for her since she wants to be a single mom by choice and keep me on child support while I help the kids and stay with them more.",

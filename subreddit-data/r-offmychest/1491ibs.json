    "postText": "I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and the cost of living has been well documented. My father was grandfathered in to owning the house after my grandfather passed away in 2004. My grandfather bought the house in 1963 and by the time he passed away he had LESS THAN A YEAR LEFT OF THE MORTGAGE TO PAY OFF!!! My idiot father gained ownership of the house in 2004 and sold it in 2012 and in the eight years he was the owner he barely paid the electricity bill or power bills. He did not upkeep the house and keep living off his savings. He barely paid the mortgage and the fact that he lasted 8 years as the owner is incredible. He could never hold down job and after he lost his delivery job in 2008 he decided not to work anymore and continued to live off whatever savings he had. By 2012 the house was going to be foreclosed or repossessed (idk which one, my father would no longer own it) so my aunt called my dad and said she will pay to fix the house but she would take 95% of the sale and he would get the remaining 5%. The house was worth 987,000 dollars in 2012 but the most my aunt could sell it for was 210,000 dollars. My aunt took her percentage and my father blew through his 5% by 2016. He is currently sleeping on a couch in a garage in a home where he is dating the owner of the house who also happens to be married. He is the most disgusting man to ever exist.\n\nToday I drove by his old house and the people who bought the house in 2012 are putting it up for sale. It is going for 1.4 million and it is a beautiful house. It has 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a backyard, and it\u2019s in a good neighborhood with an elementary school and high school nearby. They were holding an open house so I walked inside and I was furious at how nice it looked. I told the owners that I was the son of the man who they bought the house from and they thanked me for allowing them to buy the house so cheap. They had two daughters who just graduated college so they were selling the house and moving to Lake Tahoe.\n\n1.4 MILLION DOLLARS!!!! I could not believe it. My mom, younger sister, and I lived in a tiny apartment paycheck to paycheck and we could have been living in a four bedroom house with a backyard. I told my mom that the house was being sold and she nearly fainted. All because my father couldn\u2019t pay the bills and was too lazy to find a job and instead started a relationship with a married woman who has grandchildren. I am so mad right now.",

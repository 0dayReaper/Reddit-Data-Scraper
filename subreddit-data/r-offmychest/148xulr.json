    "postText": "I (24 M) am selling a car behind my dad's back that he put a 15k deposit on and put in my name when I was 19 without my knowledge till pickup of the vehicle. I've paid about 31k on this car for a little over 4 years and its caused me to empty out my bank account and sell all my investments just to keep up. Im over it now just want to get some of my money back and start living life again.\n\n\r  \nContext  - I moved out of my parents at 19 due to a disagreement with my dad and was lucky to get a decent job. My dad reached out to me 1 day and brought up this idea (since his credit was terrible but he was starting to earn low 6 figures) of me buying a car (which ill pay for 2 years) and then he'll give me the money to finish off the rest. With a good credit we'll move into a house but with my name as the forefront for the application.\n\n\r  \nSounds good so I went with it, as part of the deal I'd move back in after a year of leaving, all that was left to do was car shopping together. Fast forward a week after moving back in we go to the dealership and I thought it was finally to go car shopping. (Sidenote we also went to the bank where he had me withdraw 2k, didnt tell me what it was for, just that I would get it back soon... to date never got it back)\n\n\r  \nI end up finding out we were at the dealership to sign paperwork and give my employment details, he secured a $52k car giving a downpayment of 15k with my name as owner and I was left to pay 37k over 5 years, which basically came down to a week of my pay each month.\n\n\\*The insurance was paid by my dad under a family plan. Although ive only driven the car once since we've gotten it.\n\nI was suppose to only make payments for 2 years but it ended up being stretched 4 years and a few months. (In that time my dad bought himself a new 90k truck and paid it off just last month). I lost my job on the 4th year of payments and was in the process of applying for new jobs but my dad suggested he'd cover the payments while I work at his (6 figure) business (instead of looking for another job)... he didnt actually help until my bank account was 0 and the bank sent me late payment notices months later.\n\n\r  \nUltimately he's said after the car is paid off he'd give me back the money I spent... but like the experience with the 2k before, I never got that back yet so that doesnt  mean much now.\r  \n\n\nWe live in an apartment and he already has 2 cars... theres no parking space for this car so its used almost never. He mentioned himself that it was more an impulse buy and he doesnt need it so he might just bring it overseas back home. I'd rather just sell it get some of my money back and start a new life again.",

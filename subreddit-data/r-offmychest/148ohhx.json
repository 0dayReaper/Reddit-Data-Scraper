    "postText": "So today marks the end of my friendship with my bestfriend, and I feel relieved?\n\nI feel like it was a long time coming. We started as really great friends, but then she became really toxic, I didn't even know I was being used as an emotional crutch until very late.\n\nAfter many many mannnnny ugly fights, which really should've been the first indicator as to how she brings out the very worst in me. I don't like who I became with her, I used to be a really bubbly person that she -intentionally or not- ruined just so she could feel better about herself. \n\nI always knew she had self-esteem issues, and I tried to help her in every way, until it got to a point where I felt bad about having a more positive outlook at life and myself in general and she began to shame me for it. (It bursts out from her in the form of covered verbal lashings at small fights, which I began to take notice of more and  more over time).\n\nI actually feel great that it's finally over. Like a weight being left off. I usually never tolerate any bullshit from anyone, but she always played the victim in every one of our fights that made me always think that maybe I'm the villain.\n\nAt this point, I really don't care. Villain or not, I'm finally free.",

But i know if something happens to me he will definitely show up . But the things he said to me i won't forgive him. Also he isn't showing any remorse. It's going to hurt in the beginning . But slowly time will heal. There are a lot of good friends waiting out there . Wishing you luck op.",

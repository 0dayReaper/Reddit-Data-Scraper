    "postText": "!!! would love advice !!!\n\ni'm 15 years old and somewhat recently made a pretty bad friend. i'd like to say the whole thing was all their fault- but it wasn't. i first took one bottle, then i kept taking more. my parents don't drink very often, so they haven't noticed yet. i've stopped drinking entirely after getting drunk every night for a month. i still have one and a half-ish bottles of alcohol hiding in my room and i feel like absolute shit! i drank all of my parents' vodka and there's no way they won't notice at some point. i was caught once trying to make a drink but i lied and said it was the first time and i wouldn't do it again. i don't want to have to disappoint my parents after they were so understanding when they caught me the first time. it was a weird period of my life and if i could go back i would never have done any of it. i don't want to tell my parents because they'll be so sad, and i'm scared to face the consequences, but i think i might have to soon. i promise i'm a good kid, i just made some really bad decisions. do i tell them just parts of it? maybe i could say i took one bottle and they won't miss the others? (but if they do notice i'll be in deeper shit) i really don't know what to do and i have nobody to talk to. it's keeping me up at night and i'm terrified my mom will find the bottles when i'm not home. advice is very welcome!!!",

            "comment": "Any lies you tell here are going to just make things worse in the long run.  \nIt doesn't sound like your parents are abusive, so the best thing for you to do would be confess, and be fully honest.  \n\n\nTell your parents you need to talk to them privately about something serious.  Then tell them what you've told us: That you were influenced by a new friend, that you know that's only a contributing factor and that it's not an excuse.  Tell them how you started drinking and soon it was out of control, how you were drunk every night for a month.  Give them back what's left and tell them you don't want to drink anymore and tell them why.  \n\n\nTell them you don't want to disappoint them, or make them sad.  That you know you made bad decisions and that even though you're afraid, you're willing to face the consequences and even pay restitution.  Tell them you're willing to work to earn their trust again.  \n\n\nAlso, please be careful in the future.  Behaviour like this is a sign that you might have an issue with alcohol in the future.  (There are a lot of factors that play into alcoholism - genetics, mental health, the age you start drinking, and so many others.)  It would be worth it to keep what happened in mind as you become an adult and eventually can legally buy alcohol.  Protect yourself by being mindful, and learning early on how to set boundaries when drinking in a social setting.  (It's okay to not get drunk, or not drink at all, for instance!)  \n\n\nNot gonna lie, this whole situation might really suck for a bit, but it will be better on you to come clean than for your parents to discover it themselves.  \n\n\nBest wishes, OP.  I hope it all works out for the best.",

            "comment": "Ok so this worked for me not saying it\u2019ll work for you but you could try. \n\nFor vodka or any other clear liquid, fill the bottle up with water (clear nice water maybe bottled if your tap water isn\u2019t clear) and put it back in the bar/wherever they store their alcohol\n\nFor bourbon or brown liquids, make cold tea and dilute it with water until it\u2019s the \u2018right\u2019 colour and put the bottle back where you found it. \n\nMy mum doesn\u2019t drink a lot either and I stole a bottle of Bacardi one time and refilled it with water (I was 15/16 at the time).\n\nWhen I was of legal drinking/buying age (it\u2019s 18 where I am) I went and actually bought a proper bottle of Bacardi and replaced it (threw out the water one). I never forgot about it and was guilt ridden for years hence why I replaced it eventually. \n\nMy mum never found out or busted me, although funnily enough a couple of months after I had replaced the bottle she actually opened it :) \n\nIf you\u2019re really guilt ridden about it you could ask any older friends/relatives (that won\u2019t tell on you) to buy you replacements now and replace the bottles you stole.\n\nWe were all dumb at one point in our lives, I know the fear of parent\u2019s retribution is real (from experience) but just know it\u2019s ok to do dumb stuff like this as long as you\u2019ve leant your lesson. \n\nYou sound like a good kid, you feel guilty so that\u2019s a sign that you are a good person. Good luck in whichever path you choose.",

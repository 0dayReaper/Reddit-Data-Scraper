    "postText": "Since I turned 21 a month ago I've been going to bars to try and meet women. In that time I've only spoken to two and I had a panic attack both times. I feel completely drained from this.\nI would much rather stay at home, read, and watch rugby all evening but I also know that I'll do that for the rest of my life unless I force myself into social situations.\nI find being social as a whole incredibly exhausting, but when it comes to interacting with women (that aren't off the table romantically) this stress becomes outright fear.\nI don't know what to do anymore",

As for social situations introduce yourself when the time is right. Don't panic all you're doing is essentially talking to another vessel, find common interests and let the chemistry take it's course from there. You'll be alright if you just be YOU believe me brother.",

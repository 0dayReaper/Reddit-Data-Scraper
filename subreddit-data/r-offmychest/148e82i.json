    "postText": "My roommate and I don't get along all that much. She's not a mean person but definitely anxious, thinks she's right all the time, and condescending.\n\nShe also has strong opinions alllll the time and is selfish. I come from a world of sharing my things with people and doing things in return if something is done for me. She does not I guess. She asks me to for my milk all the time because she's cheap and wont buy her own milk if its not on sale ( she's an engineer she has a lot of money ) she uses my laundry card and I've made her dinner a couple of times. She has never ever once returned the favor which is fine. I never expected anything in return anyway.\n\nThe number one reason why we don't get along beyond all of that though is that we have very different senses of humor and if she doesn't understand something she won't even try to understand and will call it stupid. We're not mean to each other and we don't step on each other's toes. I mostly just keep interactions light.\n\nThe other day my brother popped by and asked if he could nap for a bit until he goes to his next event right next door to my place. I said sure, she was notified and she agreed. My boyfriend also popped by and she didn't care. I had to leave to go to a cottage and wouldn't be back until the next day but told both my boyfriend and brother it was fine if they stayed and then I left. My roommate said it was fine but looked so annoyed.\n\nFor reference, her sister and her boyfriend has stayed over multiple times without her there, so this is nothing new. Once I left a couple of hours later she knocked and barged in without waiting and told them thy had to leave. My bf was like oh is it because you're leaving and we don't have the key? and she ignored him and said you have 10 minutes and then left the door open.\n\nThat made my blood boil when I heard. How rude and ill mannered. I hate her.\n\nI confronted her by text as soon as I was told and as always she was never at fault.\n\nshe said \" well I tried to make the best out of an awkward situation. We even chatted a bit before they left I'm quite surprised they changed their tune now\"\n\nAfter that response I could've engaged in a long discussion explaining how rude she was and its not about what you say its how you do it but I decided not to because of her nature of being stubborn. There was no point in explaining my brother and bf were trying to be nice after getting kicked out.\n\nNow I don't even bother saying hi to her. Every time I think of her I think hw much I dislike her character.\n\n\nTLDR: Roommate was rude to my brother and boyfriend when I wasn't there",

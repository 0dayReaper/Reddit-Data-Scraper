    "postText": "I\u2019m nervous. I\u2019m excited. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m happy.\nThe doctor who is going to do my surgery has gone through the same operation as well. He seems very optimistic. \nI\u2019m sick and tired of being the way I am.. \nI\u2019m 27f and weigh 122kg at 1.61m. My bmi is 47\u2026 \nI realized long ago I can\u2019t do this on my own.. I want to get to at least 65kg. That\u2019s a whole other person weight I\u2019m trying to loose. \nI\u2019m nervous because I binge. What if I rip something.. what if I can\u2019t stick to the diet. I tell myself I can do it I tell myself I\u2019m strong enough to stick this out but I\u2019m not sure I am\u2026 \nI\u2019m excited because I\u2019ll look great once I\u2019m through this. \nI\u2019m scared because what if something goes to shit during surgery. What if I end up with the shitty side effects and they won\u2019t get better. What if I can\u2019t deal with the sudden changes. I have a huge ass family 99% think that surgeries like these are a free pass and the last way out. I\u2019ve only told my parents I\u2019ll be getting the surgery. I don\u2019t even know if I ever could tell them although they will know something is up since we are pretty close and I\u2019ll see them during celebrations coming up at the end of the month and I will be on liquids.. \nmy parents are supportive so are a few other family members but I\u2019m just so overwhelmed. \nHow do I get out of my own head? Im happy to have made this decision but also terrified and also feel like a little kid for writing about this :/  \n\nAnyway thanks for reading, I\u2019ll see what the operation brings in a couple of hours.",

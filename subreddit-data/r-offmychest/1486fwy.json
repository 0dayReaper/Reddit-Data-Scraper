    "postText": "Yeah, so, my first ever Reddit post. \nI\u2019ve been in a pretty awesome relationship for almost 12 years at this point. Lately, however, I\u2019ve been thinking about the guy I dated briefly before meeting my current partner. I\u2019ll just call him J. We talked/dated over the span of a few months in 2010. I remember having great chemistry with him. I still think about us sharing what was probably one of the most romantic, passionate kisses I\u2019ve had in my life. Sadly, it ended up not working out. Months later we started texting back and forth again, pretty flirty, but not going beyond that. This went on for about 6 months off and on, until I met my current partner, M. After becoming serious with M, I let J know I was in a relationship and we could continue to talk as friends. I think J and I could\u2019ve have been good friends, especially with the things we had in common. But I didn\u2019t hear from him after that, or so I thought. \n\nThis was mid 2011, right around when Facebook messenger came out. I never really had a reason to use it when it was new and turned off notifications. Almost a year later in 2012 I start using messenger to connect more with family. There were notifications that would not go away and I could not figure it out. Eventually I discovered the notifications were for messages from J.\n -Jan 29, 2012 \u201cHello. Do you still exist somewhere?\u201d And \u201cLook, I\u2019m very sorry about barely being there before, and I\u2019d wish you\u2019d talk to me.\u201d\n-May 17 2012 \u201cThis is the last time I\u2019ll try, and then I\u2019ll let you be. I hope that one day you\u2019ll respond.\u201d \n\nIt was a few months after the last message until I even knew these existed. I really did want to answer him back, but I was still in the first year of my relationship. I didn\u2019t want to upset M by reaching out to J. M had been cheated on in the past and I didn\u2019t want to create any doubt in the relationship. But the messages stay in the archives of messenger and I read them every so often wondering if too much time has passed to reach out to J. \nI don\u2019t know if he was my \u201cone that got away\u201d or could have just been a really awesome friend. I feel like the universe has been pushing me more strongly to reach out, but I also fear looking like a crazy person if he\u2019s completely written me off after all this time. \nI\u2019ve been holding this in for 10 1/2 years. I\u2019ve just always felt so conflicted yet have so much regret over this. Even if one person sees this I\u2019ll feel relieved.",

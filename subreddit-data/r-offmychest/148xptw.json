    "postText": "Got dumped in April because I was too mentally unstable. It was my first real relationship and he led me on for months. My medicine wasn\u2019t doing anything so I switched and it gave me memory loss and made my brain all foggy. Switched again and now I\u2019m having like really eccentric anger issues. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because I just switched and it\u2019ll calm down soon, but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not thinking straight as of right now, I\u2019m physically exhausted but I just needed to say that basically I\u2019m struggling. My trauma is so hard on me as of lately. Getting motivated to go to work is exhausting. I don\u2019t know anymore I just need someone to talk to.",

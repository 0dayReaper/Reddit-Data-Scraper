    "postText": "About 4 months ago a found out that my boyfriend had been talking to severl people online. All very explicit conversations, as if he was wanting to fulfill some fantasy. In the past I have tried to bring up the conversation of fantasy/things that you want to try and he told me there was nothing. Long story kind-of short. I found out he tried to reach out to one of those people last week. I keep asking him if he wants an open relationship or if I am just not enough for him. I just want answers and reasoning for his actions and he won't give me anything. I love him. I put my dreams on hold and worked overtime at a job that I hated so he could pursue his dreams. Now I am dependent on him so even if I had the will power to leave, I can't. I haven't told anyone, all of my friends are his friends.",

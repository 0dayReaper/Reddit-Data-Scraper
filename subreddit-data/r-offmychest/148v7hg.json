I don\u2019t like where we live (different culture from my upbringing), I absolutely hate my job (even though it pays well), my in-laws bore the hell out of me at this point (they\u2019re country folk, I was raised in the suburbs), I miss being around my people (I\u2019m black, living in a predominantly white area), and now we have a kid\u2026\n\nHow do I enjoy myself again like I used to?",

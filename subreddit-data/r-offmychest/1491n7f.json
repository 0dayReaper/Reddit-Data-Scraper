    "postText": "When I was a kid, my brother was abusive to me. Back when I was only 14 years old, he beat me up pretty badly. My dog launched herself at him and bit him.\n\nOur parents wanted to euthanize her, even though I told them it was my brother\u2019s fault for assaulting me in front of her and that he had the bite coming for him. They didn\u2019t listen to me. My brother was all gleeful, taunting me about how he\u2019d have my dog put down and I won\u2019t be able to do anything about it. That night I waited until they and my brother were asleep, then took her and left the house forever. \n\nLast week I met my mom and dad at a grocery store. They were just as shocked by the encounter as I was. I must say I\u2019ve thought a lot over the years about what I\u2019d say if I met the two of them again but when I did meet them, I just stared and walked away.",

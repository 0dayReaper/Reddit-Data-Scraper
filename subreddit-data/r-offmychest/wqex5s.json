    "postText": "I (32M) am a widow. My wife passed away from pancreatic cancer five years ago. She was forced to leave behind our two kids, R (10M) and H (7M). My wife was the absolute light of my life. We were high school sweethearts, went to the same college, and got married after graduation. We were inseparable. Every day I fell more in love with her; it was like my heart was living outside my body. When she passed, the amount of pain I was in was indescribable. I prayed to go to sleep and not wake up just so I could see her one last time. I contemplated meeting her, but every time I was ready, my kids would look at me. They had her face, her personality, her DNA, I couldn\u2019t leave them. They were all I had left of her. It took years before I was able to function normally again. I even quit my job and lived off of savings and her life insurance for about a year. I was half the dad I used to be and only a fraction of my former self. Two years after her passing, I decided enough was enough and I kicked myself into gear. I found a job in a different city (closer to my parents), I packed my kids up, and I moved. Life was hard, but I kept chugging along and eventually I found some joy. A year after moving, I took a business trip to NY where I met my current girlfriend, L. While I acknowledged there was chemistry, I told her I was already married and she understood. However, a few months later I had to go back to NY where we met up again. I let my guard down for the first time around her. Before I knew it, she was putting in a transfer for my home branch and moving to my city. I fell in love with her and asked her out a year ago next month. My kids adore her and though she reminded them she will never take their moms place, they lovingly call her \u201cmomma L.\u201d Today was the anniversary of my wife\u2019s passing, an extremely hard day for all of us. This morning I walked into the living room to find L and my kids waiting for me. The kids were dressed in their church clothes with goofy smiles on their faces and bouquets in hand. Apparently, L came up with the idea of a picnic at my wife\u2019s grave, an idea that the boys loved as they enjoy going to see their mom. While I was sleeping they prepared food and flowers, then insisted on wearing their best clothes. I\u2019ll admit that I cried at the sight of them. I don\u2019t know how I got this lucky twice in a row. I wanted my wife to meet this amazing woman, so I asked L to come along and she did. The day that I dread every year turned out to be a humbling reminder of the reason why I stayed on this planet.\n\nTo my lovely wife, you can never be replaced, but she is good to me and she takes care of our kids like you would. Thank you for sending her to me.",

I\u2019m truly sorry for the loss of your wife and children\u2019s mum, far too soon. And truly happy that you were blessed to find real love again. Your wife would be smiling, I think.",

I already ran it by the kids and to say they were excited is an understatement (though I think my youngest is more excited for her dog that would come with her). \n\nThank you all again.",

My husband and I waited 8 years to get married, all for very practical reasons, including eliminating student loan/other debt so the other wouldn't have to marry the others debt. We were in a good place until I was laid off 3 months before the wedding. I had a good severance, and unemployment but it all went to wedding and household expenses, so in the end we still went into the marriage with debt. None of it matters, we still made it through to the other side with a house and another cat, and I finally got a new job in my dream industry with the support of my husband!",

According to surveys many widowed guys go too quickly into new relationships cause they can't be alone and as a result, their new SOs suffer cause they constantly feel like they can't live up to the ghost of the previous wife or gf or feel like they don't have a place in the guy's house and his heart, and meanwhile the widowers were just not ready to move on yet and kept obsessing over the past. \n\nIt's so heartwarming to read the opposite happening here. Makes me want to cry actually. I can feel that you care for your wife and gf both very much. Your title is horrifying though lol, like the other redditors I was assuming the worst. \n\nYou're truly blessed to find two such people who are so amazing in your life. It's far too often that we hear horrible stereotypical stepmom stories and how tough it is for widows and widowers to start another relationship healthily. I wish you will have a long and happy life with your gf and kids in the future. Unlike the consensus here, I'm going to say the opposite that you don't have to rush to marry her yet or at all till you're ready for the next step.\n\nIt's not easy to pick yourself up after the passing of a loved one, even for the remaining loved ones we have. You sound like a great dad to your kids too.",

You remind me today to be thankful for all the good memories of my partner instead of letting them depress me into the dark. \n\nYou also teach me that it is *okay* to still have love in your heart and reserve that for them even if you meet someone new. It's not selfish, I don't have to \"get over her\" because she is gone. She's a part of my mind &amp; soul and that is okay.\n\nThank you for the lessons, my friend.",

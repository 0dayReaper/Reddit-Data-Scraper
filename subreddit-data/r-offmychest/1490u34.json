Being very indifferent, complete silent towards me for no reason. \n\nWhen I asked her what's the problem she said nothing you just think like that.\n\nBut I know something is on her mind that she is not sharing. The only thing I could find out for her behaviour which I got to know from another colleague of mine, is that not been giving enough of my time to her.\n\nYou see a few weeks back our office sitting arrangement were changed and we both do our own thing with our own teammates.\n\nWe still get together for lunch but as mentioned last 2 days this situation of avoiding my calls and not talking much is frustrating and it hurts. Even yesterday she did not pick up my call for lunchtime. Only after lunchtime she messaged back saying \"Done Lunch now\". \n\nWe used to go out for eats, snacks and evening walks, shopping post our office time. All this has stop.\n\nI have not done anything to hurt her. You can tell me if I am over thinking things here and need to give her some space.\n\nBut she was the one joking with me and coming to my sitting. Miss those days.",

    "postText": "It\u2019s like I\u2019m perpetually carrying a burden on my back. When I\u2019m walking, i feel it of course, but my body has already adjusted to it and is actually doing stuff. When I fixate on the burden, it just makes me feel tired and want to stop walking, which I usually do. The worst part? Talking doesn\u2019t even help. Talking is just rehashing out all my internal thoughts, but fleshed out because text, and wasting hours on it. I can\u2019t live without talking about it, though. Sometimes I just have to talk, or I\u2019ll be insanely frustrated and incapable of regular emotion. After talking, all I am is tired, drained and feeling worse than how I had started off.",

Carrying out that stress is no good. It will kill you slowly. Talk yo whoever you can if you feel you must. You know you best. Sometimes pulling the knife out hurts more than the knife when its lodged in. But at least the knife is out and you can properly heal.",

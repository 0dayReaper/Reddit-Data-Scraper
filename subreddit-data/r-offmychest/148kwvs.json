    "postText": "Daddy, how could you?\nI was your little girl, so trusting\nWith your hand on my thigh, \nI thought it was loving.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t, it was filled with darkness.\nAs your fingers inched closer up my leg,\nI was scared to move; inside I begged.\n\u201cPlease just hold me like a daddy should\u201d\n\nIs this how a man loves his daughter?\nLying next to you at night, \nHoping my clothes were just too tight\nThat you couldn\u2019t slide your fingers inside\nI tried to be still and pretend to sleep\nMaybe you would have stopped if I made a peep?\n\nYour touch so soft as to not wake me,\nBut I felt it all; did you think this would break me?\nWell you were wrong!\n\nAs my body developed; so did my strength.\nNot physically but the fire within me grew;\nwith every visit, every afternoon alone, with every beer you drank.\n\nFinally when I saw my beautiful baby niece; \nwalk across the lounge room into your arms;\nMy voice emerged, I could finally speak.\nI was now a protector instead of a victim;\nI needed to keep her from any harm.\n\nHarm from you, from you and your darkness.\nShe wouldn\u2019t become your sweet little princess;\nShe would have the childhood I wished I had\nThose innocence eyes wouldn\u2019t know the dread; \nThe disgust in her own body; the confusion of love; \n\nShe would stay pure and you wouldn\u2019t have won.\n\nYou haven\u2019t won.",

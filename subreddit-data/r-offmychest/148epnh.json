    "postText": "Last night hit me hard and I asked myself what I\u2019m doing wrong with everything. I\u2019m M30 getting drinks with my friend Zoey F28. \nShe\u2019s talking about work, how it\u2019s going and starts talking about her travel plans\nHer boyfriend and her along with her brother and his girlfriend are taking a road trip to California. And again a month after that to Denver. In my head I thought they were broken up cause he thinks her bad, cheated and all that. I guess I was wrong. It makes me wonder what\u2019s wrong with me. Like am I a bad choice? The girls I know would rather take a chance on a guy who\u2019s cheated on them and treated them bad. He\u2019s changed now and what not but that\u2019s the same thing over and over. I hate being a shoulder to cry on or to call someone. It\u2019s making me think that relationships just suck and that I will never be in one ever and just have to accept that fact",

Some already will, but sounds like perhaps not the ones you know.\n\nSo, don't lose hope and shrink and shrivel.\n\nAttend to the the basics: Stable situation, dress with some care, make smalltalk with pleasant wit, project competence but not arrogance, don't make all the running yourself, get out there and refuse no social engagement, especially with alcohol. It's Summer. Good luck, OP.",

Right now that\u2019s not the case and I\u2019m just getting discouraged left and right\nI hate trying and trying but never can seem to find anyone without finding out they\u2019re with someone. The worst part is that the women I talk to seem to magnet towards my other family members like my cousins or my other guy friends\nI\u2019m left in the background wondering what the hell I did wrong",

    "postText": "22F and feeling like a piece of shit. I live with my family at home. I\u2019ve been jobless since about January I recently graduated from college in December and quit a factory job that I was working in mid January that helped payed for a trip. I\u2019m really struggling to find a job and having motivation and am  really depressed  and struggling mentally while fighting some addiction like ( phone usage, porn, binge eating). and this morning I woke up late probably like 10 am. Going into a bad routine of being on my phone and feeling like shit- I ate puppy chow my mother made the night before trigger a negativity on my eating.My mom texted me and said like I had to turn on the crockpot at 11 and I thought I did I thought I turn on the crockpot I guess what I turned on a different appliance until like the crockpot wasn\u2019t even cooking the food and then my mom got home and dinner wasn\u2019t made. For most of they day I tried staying away from being upstairs and cleaning up a bit and trying to journal and keep a healthy mind. I washed the dishes and I wish I realized that it was not on by the smell. When my mom came home I was working on a side business reselling clothes and then she noticed it wasn\u2019t on. She got really angry and went on a huge rant which I don\u2019t blame her for. \n\nShe also said that I don\u2019t act my age and that I am being lazy. Waking up late and what am I going to do for Money. My bank account is getting low and I haven\u2019t been really been doing much on my online shop for a few days. \n\nI was really trying to resist using my phone today and focus on my side business.\n\nI really do hate living at home these months. My father is verbally abusive and maybe bipolar and my parent\u2019s relationship together is not good. I have been going on interviews and not getting jobs even some in my field I studied. I am isolated from most of my college friends except the few times I go back to my college town about an hour away. \n\nI have a learning disability (SLD) and I do struggle accurately estimating time and a bit of dyscalculia/ money management. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I should tell my mother. \n\nBut I do know I am mentally unwell living at home. I need a job and I want to move out and live in a city with more opportunities film production than I have right now and therapy. \n\nFor the moment I have tried to calm myself down and I went outside now I am going for a walk. When I come back I just wanna tell her I am sorry- during the whole rant I could say anything- I want to tell her I been suffering with my bing eating disorder and more. \n\nI feel like for months I have been stuck and feeling like shit.. about having no job and dislocating. Maybe I just need to work a shitty job for a few months and save Money.",

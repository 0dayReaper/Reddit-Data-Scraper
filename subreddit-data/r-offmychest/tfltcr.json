    "postText": "No one put a gun to my head. I wasn't smuggled into doing this work and it all happened in a free country, in a legitimately run studio easily recognized for producing hardcore content.\u00a0\n\n\nNo one tells you how awkward and intimidating it is, especially when you're an 18 year old girl, surrounded by a roomful of casting agents, executives and producers/directors all men of course just pushing their own degrading YET PROFITABLE agendas, but they polish it, they sell and pitch it well, especially if you're young, they talk to you in a way that it only makes sense to an 18 year old. Looking back in recollection, it's all very patronizing\u00a0\n\n\nThey'll have you believing your own non existant hype in exchange for taking your identity, ruining your body and sacrificing your sanity and ultimately your soul. But you will \u201clook so hot\u201d and \u201cbe such a bad b\u201d is what they tell you\n\n\nNo one tells you that they don't actually care that you are coked out your mind during filming and that the directors actually PREFER THAT YOU ARE HIGH so they can coerce (in their words \u201cdirect\u201d) you to do things you'd never usually do like multiple penetrative gang anal, being urinated on, throated, bukkake, all of the degrading abusive genres\n\n\n\u00a0If you're not a big name performer and just starting in this industry the pressure to do extreme is PUSHED ASSERTIVELY because they know you are na\u00efve or easily intimidated because you are new, but the truth is, it's because they can\u00a0PAY YOU FAR LESS than they do for big name performers that can afford to demand premium pay to do extreme scenes.\u00a0\n\n\nSo basically as a porn rookie your underpaid ripped, infected asshole, mouth and vagina are essentially only about profit and economics for these studios.\u00a0\n\n\nThere is no drug testing, you just sign a form to verify that you are not high, but often times you are\u00a0 INSTRUCTED by directors and PA's themselves NOT to fill out that you're high.\u00a0\n\n\nThey film a \u201cconsent\u201d video to verify that you were ok with whatever transgressions happened to your body, but is it really consent if you're threatened that you won't get paid while the directors/production assistants guilt trip you about wasted filming/crew time or constantly yell at you to cooperate and consent?\n\n\nDo you know how AWFUL it is watching yourself being gang banged/raped when you are clean, sober and having little recollection of it happening?\u00a0\n\n\nDo you know what it's like constantly fearing having ANY intimacy with ANYONE because they think they have the absolute right to abuse you because they saw it happen to you in a video.\u00a0\n\n\nEven worse is me knowing my abuse is freely available to view out there for any young people to watch and form toxic ideas about sex and non consent.\u00a0\n\n\nI Iive inside this nightmare EVERY SINGLE DAY!\u00a0\n\n\nThe studios do not care that you are broken, theyve made THEIR own BIG PAYOUT off MY name, MY body, MY degredation. In exchange for what? $1000, $1500 per shoot so I can afford medical expenses for my grandmother, fix my car, pay my bills, feed a destructive drug habit, to live... in exchange for getting my anus ripped apart by strangers so many times that I need to inject it with Botox in order to heal and not defecate involuntarily in public?\n\nNever mind what I will need to heal my mind, because I'm so far gone that may never heal.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0If you think this industry helps performers with healthcare, that's a joke since THERE IS ZERO HEALTH CARE OR PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORTS FOR PORN ACTORS. ZERO!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0All they care about is sti testing and even on that front there are so many flaws and loopholes and lies.\u00a0\n\n\nI cannot tell anybody how or why or why not to use porn, that is everyone's personal choice\u00a0\n\n\nbut if this, THIS is what you find entertaining, please understand there is a very steep price people out here have paid with their bodies and soul, for your 5 minutes of empty pleasure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit; I am overwhelmed by the kindness and positivity so many of you have messaged me with and much thanks to those who've awarded my post.\n\nThis post was purely meant as a cathartic release in the form of words and I'm thankful there are platforms like this one for venting in such an unfiltered way\n\nEven though I no longer participate in the industry I am by no means anti porn, many people who choose to do porn do so for their own reasons that's not for me to judge. Yes, I've met a few very rare people in the business who are genuinely good. This was my own experiences within the trade, but I do believe the industry does have a responsibility to look out for the interest of their sex workers, ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG OR NEW PEOPLE, and not manipulate them",

I saw the documentary by Rashida Jones and other women about the porn industry and how barely adult young women are taken advantage of in the porn industry called \"Hot Girls Wanted.\" There's a sequel as well.\n\nWhen I saw that I thought there actually has to be more and worse. IIRC it barely touches on what you went through.\n\nI'm so sorry, OP. I hope you're doing better.\n\nEdit: \n\n\"Hot Girls Wanted\" and it's sequel, \"Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On\" are both on Netflix if anyone is interested in watching it.",

I have videos of me on porn sites that I didn't know existed until about a couple of years ago when a friend showed it to me, and one consisted of me being gang-raped by 7 men when I was 16 or 17. It has well over 200k views. It was never taken down or anything done about it and just posted to multiple other porn sites. The comments of people hurt just as bad and I never been able to watch it with audio on. And now some realized it was genuine rape but still didn't care was demoralizing. I also found one of myself being raped when I was 8. There's a lot of me up until about 4 months ago when I ran away/escaped those people. I'm 24 now.\n\nI understand exactly how you feel. This is the most devastating and painful thing about the porn sites/industry. I hope you can get proper help. From my experience, therapy doesn't fix it, it only makes you functional to where it doesn't affect your day-to-day life without interference. But the memory and thoughts will be there every day, but being able to do something even if it's little things is better than being crippled mentally. It will give you ptsd.\n\nIf it's long term while the frontal lobe is still developing it can develop a CPTSD that's caused from consistent trauma non-stop over a course of years, which that is a more complex and serious case than just PTSD and leaves you with permanent brain damage and having memory loss issues along with other complications. I have it and to process of that in therapy is different than PTSD and non-curable due to the damaged brain, but there's a huge help in it regardless. So Identifying the struggles you have and working on that will definitely help.\n\nI really wish you the best in life. Stay strong!",

It made me think \"are they sober while doing this\", \"are they ACTUALLY enjoying this type of treatment\", \"are they really doing this voluntarily or were they pressured in some shape of form because of financial or personal reasons\".... because I would HATE to be treated the way any female gets treated in those videos and this post literally confirmed my suspicions and I am so fucking sorry OP. I'm in tears for you. And you provided all the gory details. I'm so sorry you went thru this. It doesn't matter if people had to do this because of their circumstance it doesn't change the fact that you felt mistreated and ended up with a lot of physical, mental, and emotional damage on top of getting traumatized.

I\u2019m sure some women genuinely loved it, but it disturbed me). It always felt wrong. When I lived in a smaller town slightly before internet porn ubiquity, all my sexual encounters were a little more normal and sweet, but then starting around 2015 I met a ton of women who seemed to be cool on dates but then wanted me to really fuck em up, hit them, degrade them and it just kind of disturbed me. I never ended up doing any of it out of pleasure and always left the encounters with regret and sadness. Luckily I found a partner who\u2019s as \u201ctame\u201d as me and we\u2019re engaged now but it was a wild few years of being single.

There's something remarkably touching in the perspective you have to offer.\n\nAnd as painful as your experience was, the story is beneficial as a warning and just an effective \"behind the scenes\" for those who haven't considered perspectives of people in your situation before.\n\n&gt; I am by no means anti porn, this was my own experiences within the trade, but I do believe the industry does have a responsibility to look out for the interest of their sex workers, ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG OR NEW PEOPLE, and not manipulate them\n\nI am \"moderately\" anti-porn. To be more specific, I think that it's morally bad and may merit increased regulations, but I wouldn't advocate for a wholesale ban at this point.\n\nPart of that is due to the experiences of those involved in production, like yours, but part is also the impacts on consumers / users / addicts of porn.\n\nLike if you think about the people who have seen that video. Is it healthy for them to watch a gang-rape for the purpose of sexual gratification? I see that behavior as injurous to them, because it kind of ... like it, gives them an opportunity to practice enjoying the abuse and suffering of another person. Seems really harmful to them.\n\nAnyway, I'm not trying to preach to you, just to let you know that if you decided to be anti-porn, even though it's unpopular these days, you would not be holding an unreasonable position.",

And I was told that I would get paid. I just keep getting lines of coke and paying for the shit motel room. I only knew it was recorded like a year later when my uh, ex pimp? Sent me a clip.\n\nAnd it sent me back to all the heinous child pornography I am in. And I can clearly remember names of tapes... they were often in volumes... 1, 2, 3, 4... there had to be 100's. It was a long time ago. And those child pornography rings, they keep things. I am sure people still watch me getting gang raped and other horrific shit, when I was a child. And I don't think I'll ever feel safe because I don't know where it is and how to make sure it stops.\n\nThank you for being so vulnerable and honest. It is hard to comprehend how evil people are. And I'm sure you've touched people who were never going to talk about this happening to them. Even if they stay silent... they know they're not alone. And that is invaluable.",

Many women claim porn is freedom, an allowance to cash in on their bodies and it's completely by choice. But the dark side of porn is that many of these women are suffering from abuse and usually producing films while they are high. Drugs are a tool for manipulation and compliance in the porn industry and that I CANNOT STAND FOR. The porn industry, especially hardcore and extreme is extremely misogynistic and degrading towards women. No representation of real life porn in these productions because the woman is just an object and a woman's pleasure doesn't exist.  T\n\nI am so sorry that you were taken advantage of at such a vulnerable age. THAT EXPERIENCE DOES NOT DEFINE YOU.  You are more than your experiences and your body. And honestly boo, a worthy partner of yours has probably never viewed that degrading gang bang video of yours anyway. Not all men view extreme or misogynist porn.

They would do a lot of what you described where they would encourage the girls to be drunk or high, and abused and raped a lot of these women. All 6 people involved in that operation have been arrested and convicted of various charges. I'm not saying you need to come forward, but I guarantee you aren't the first or last victim of these bags of human garbage. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GirlsDoPorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GirlsDoPorn)\n\nThe suicide/overdose rates among pornstars are insanely high (Dakota Skye, August Ames, Anastasia Knight, Zoe Parker, Dahlia Sky, Amber Rayne are just off the top of my head), if you watch the news there's usually at least 1 a month. The prevalence of substance abuse and mental health issues among pornstars is incredibly high. There are POS that work in the industry with no consequences (James Deen, Ron Jeremy, Michael Masters, Riley Reid, Peter North have all been accused of rape/sexual assault).\n\nDo I think sex work can be done ethically? Yes. But the industry has shown time and again that it cannot be trusted to regulate itself so there needs to be more regulation and labor laws regarding pornstars and sex work. \n\nWe as a society are continuing to fail these people. We can do better. Find ethical sources of pornography and treat sex workers like people, not objects.\n\nThis is something I've thought about a lot and care about a lot. I'm sorry you're going through this OP. I don't know if it makes it better or worse to know you're not alone in this. I know it's not a lot, but my heart goes out to you. I believe you'll make it through this. This is a throwaway, but I'll check back if you need someone to talk to you can message me.

I think after reading this I definitely know why. I\u2019ve always thought it looks awful and fake sometimes the things some female porn stars do. I\u2019ve always explained to my partner how terrible it is that most men unfortunately grew up with thinking women want that. I\u2019ve always said to men I\u2019ve been with that Pornographers are paid to pretend to like that to fulfill weird male fantasies. I am sorry you went through this. I am a survivor of domestic abuse and rape too. I\u2019ve been in therapy on and off for ten years because of things I went through as a young adult. I just wanted to say thank you for sharing this here. I hope you know your story is actually really courageous to me that you did something to help pay your bills. You should forgive yourself. But not those men. Is there nowhere you could report that? Or these men in this industry just continue to get away with doing this? It sounds awful how they railroaded you. And made you sign things saying you\u2019re not high then encouraging to do it. Wtf I had no idea how bad it was in reality until I read this. I\u2019m not a therapist but I hope you get to talk to someone. It sounds awful and I think it\u2019s very brave and strong for you to come forward with this post.

I grew up with a negative view of sex, maybe I'm just trying to embrace my desires and convince myself they're not evil and that I'm not poison. Maybe I'm just having another horny phase and want to *consume.* Anything and everything.\n\nBut oh, God, why do I ignore my conscience? The porn industry is evil, evil. Fucking evil. The worst part is the aftermath, because *I don't always know where those images came from.* In reality, I never know, do I? Sure, the woman may be smiling, but how do I know if that's because she's actually enjoying what she is doing? Even worse, you *don't even know the age of the person.* There is nothing telling you. I'm 20, but anytime I see the word \"teen\", I zip the hell out. But it's still not always clear. It's never clear. And my OCD brain already plays tricks on me and makes me question \"did you masturbate to children? How do you know that wasn't a child?\"\n\nNo, no, absolutely not. Please no, I can't bear that. I feel like such a monster all the time. My greatest fear in life is that my existence causes others pain. But these uncertainties haven't made me stop consuming sex so carelessly yet. I don't know what's safe. Maybe nothing is.\n\nKind person, thank you for sharing your story. I don't have adequate words to say how awful I feel. The regret I feel, and the amount of despair I have for the world. You were just a kid. You -- nobody -- deserves this. \n\nI really hope you can find a good, caring partner someday who listens to and respects you as the beautiful person you are. I know they exist, they have to. You are more than your past and your suffering. You are human, a whole person, and no one can take that away from you. I wish you only my best, internet neighbor. I am sorry. I am so, so sorry.",

Beyond having a database like the one mentioned earlier though, I have no idea how to put that genie back in the bottle.\n\nAround 1999, when my workplace was in a large government building, there was a young woman in one of the offices who was so sweet and naive.  If you saw her in one of the main halls, and said hello, she'd look down at the floor because she was so shy.    Her stepdad also worked in the building, and she moved on after a few months, but then it seemed like everyone there was talking about her and he new career in porn.  As you can guess, a boyfriend talked her into trying it, and the money was just too easy.  I felt so bad for her stepdad because he was obviously embarrassed about it, but this was right as the internet was becoming huge and there was no hiding it.  She did a bunch of films and her story is very similar to yours.  She is married now and does public speaking on the subject. I'm also not anti porn, but man, in a car commercial they put a disclaimer under the ad if someone is driving fast.  Maybe put something like \"This is a performance.  Your girl is NOT going to squirt like this and your dick is almost certainly going to be smaller than the main guy.  And that's OK.\"",

In my case, I actually do not like hardcore shit at all because it feels so weird to me. I actually prefer content that pretty much looks like couples doing stuff tbh. That aside, I genuinely want to rid of my porn addiction, which is basically masturbating at least once a day on average. I don't really find porn to be useful. I already know so much about sex                anyways and pleasing women is quite simple and easy after you get a lot of experience in. That aside, I am slowly leaning more against the use of porn as I get older and from what I have seen pornstars talk about on podcasts and so forth, it seems like the porn industry is rabid with so much darkness, shitty people, abusers, and just a lot of fucking trauma. I sincerely wish you the best of luck in healing, mentally and physically. I don't want to recommend the use of drugs here, but I have been raped as well as a man, which society doesn't give a shit about. Hell, I even made a trueoffmychest post about it and nobody cared lol. What helped me get through a lot of trauma, was honestly LSD. I just want to be transparent that this was the only thing that helped me. I don't recommend it, because everyone is different, but that is what helped me get past a lot of trauma in my life. I hope you have a tight knit group of friends and/or family that I didn't have. I hope people are there for you.",

I know this sounds so weird and I def sound like a creepy neckbeard going \"umm hentai.\" But if you're someone who feels really disturbed by this story and the truth of the porn industry (which you should) and are hesitant to stop watching (not anti porn, but am anti-gang rape) that kind of porn then seek out hentai instead. Show less support to industries like these.\n\nOP I'm so sorry for what you and so many other sex workers go and have gone through.

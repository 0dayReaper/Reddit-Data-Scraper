    "postText": "Something I really love about demon slayer that no one talks about is they have REALISTIC anime moments. I'm not talking about the fight scenes. Im talking about when Tanjiro says \"If he has a problem I'll head butt them!\" And he just responds with a real world answer that makes things awkward. Or when he's asking about Flamebreathing and she just says \"nope\" and he doesn't know what to say. Growing up as a nerd I tried to use anime moments in real life and got the same reaction. So seeing real anime reaction is a fantastic touch and no one seems to be talking about it.",

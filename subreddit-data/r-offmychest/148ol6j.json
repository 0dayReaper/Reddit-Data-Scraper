    "postText": "So I(19M) have been dating this girl(18) for about 6 months now. At the start of the relationship everything was great we would talk everyday, hang out when we could and go out to eat and everything. I\u2019d say at the 4ish month marker everything changed in s way. We started to fight more and more, and we would always have some sort of attitude towards each other. I can honestly feel myself disconnecting at this point emotionally and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve stopped being as overly affectionate like I was and I\u2019ve just been in a overall meh mood when I\u2019m around her. I feel guilty because I don\u2019t want the relationship to end but at the same time it feels like it should. We both aren\u2019t the same like we were when we got together and things just have gotten worse.",

But that's both your brains releasing tons of chemicals, clouding how you see that person.\n\nWell, after the honeymoon period, those chemicals wear off. Moreover, by that point, you've come to know your partner. Who they are, how they behave, what they are like. And that's with warts and all. So, that's where you are: you are in a relationship with a real person. And that person isn't perfect.\n\nWhat will make or break your relationship is the willingness on either end to get over that, and start putting in the work. Sometimes, one of you is tired or grumpy or annoyed, well, figure out how to deal with that. Not just one of you, but the both of you. It's really, always, you two versus the problem. Moreover, in a really good relationship, you are also best friends who can trust each other, that is: you can talk, and feel safe enough to talk, about what's going on with you.\n\nSo, yeah, relationships means putting in some effort and work. And of course having fun together.\n\nThing is, you are 19 and you're barely 6 months together. You're not married, and you still have a massive amount of stuff of life you need to figure out. That's what you're 20s are all about. It's okay for a relationship to not survive whatever changes will happen in both your lives. Sad, but okay.\n\nYou want to take the pointers I just gave, sit down with her, and talk about them. Ask her how she feels about the entire thing, figure out what the both of you want for yourselves, what you hope for the future, and that you just want to enjoy this.",

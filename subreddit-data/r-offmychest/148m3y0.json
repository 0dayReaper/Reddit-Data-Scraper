    "postText": "This will be a long story, and I apologise for my English.\n\nIt has started a long time ago, about half a year ago. I asked on a website if there are girls who are submissive because I wanted to have a sexting. A girl had answered me and we moved to Instagram.\n\nThen I told her a little bit about that stuff, and I added that we should talk for a bit after the sexting.\n\nWe had done it and then we talked. After some days, I sent her that I'm afraid to fall in love, and she was really nice.\n\nThis is how it has started. I will not be able to tell the whole story, only some parts of it, especially the bad ones because we had a complicated relationship.\n\nWe broke up many times.\n\nAbout two moths ago, I texted her in order to ask if there's a chance that we will get back together. We did, for almost two months.\n\nI believe that it is important to mention that the last time we broke up after I had a sexual conversation with another girl, but it was short and I hung up. Then I said that I wanted to break up, and we did. Then I started posting shit about our relationship (I wrote some unpleasant stuff, not directly about her), and after some days I got mad and\u2026 Well, I'm not proud of it, but the conversation was tough.\n\nWe both felt something for each other, and I really tried to get better for her, and she did notice that. She even thanked me and said that she's disappointed in herself.\n\nShe has a very low self-esteem, even though she is gorgeous. She has never sent a picture of herself, but I did see her face and she sent me a picture where the face was barely seen; she also sent me a picture of her thigh. Of course, I asked her a million times if she's ok with doing that, and I myself sent pictures and videos of myself (not something dirty).\n\nFor the weeks I felt tired of her because she's been complaining a lot without trying to solve it. It has existed always, I am familiar with this behaviour, but it was really tiring! Like, why do I have to beg you to go to the doctor or make yourself food?\n\nTrust me, I would have gone with her to the doctor and even made her food if she had let me.\n\nThis leads us to another problem: we was frightened to meet me because she thought that I might not like her appearance. I had tried to tell her that this is not an option, but she did not listen.\n\nSo, two days ago, I told her that I want to break up, because I was tired of waiting and trying my best without even having a VC.\n\nI know that she doesn't owe me anything, but how can you tell someone that you love him and desire to hug him without overcoming your fears?\n\nAfter an hour I texted a girl that I had sexting with, but she politely declined my offer because she has someone. And at night I texted another girl, which also declined my offer.\n\nI didn't fight them or something, I respectfully said 'Goodbye' and left the chat.\n\nAm I a horrible person who doesn't deserve love? I feel like I am.\n\nAnd don't tell me that women owe me something. I know they don't, but at least don't make me fall in love with you and don't tell me that you want to hug and kiss me, without even trying to achieve it by doing small steps, like sending a picture or having a VC with the guy you LOVE.\n\nNeither did I say that she owes me something. I know she doesn't, I think I owe her much more.\n\nPS I do hope she texts me because I think that I broke with her up too quickly. Maybe it's for the better, I don't know. I hope there will be a good update.",

It\u2019s the same way that they undid the KKK in the 50\u2019s, an undercover journalist joined their ranks, learned all their code words, and then teamed up with a artist who made popular kids cartoons. The next thing you knew, all of these words were now being used by 8 year olds across the country and totally took the wind out of their sails. It\u2019s the small things that sometimes work so much more effectively than brute force.",

Whereas Birth of a Nation makes the KKK look like valiant Southern knights, Superman makes them look like the goofy Nazi-sympathizers that they are. While the recruiting swells still happen, they're nowhere near as big as they were from 1920-1950.",

    "postText": "A few months ago we met at the gas station. She didn\u2019t have any money on her and she was trying to get to a bus stop a few blocks away. I drove her on the way we were chatting about everything. We really got along and after finding out she didn\u2019t have anywhere to go I asked her if she\u2019d like me to get her something to eat. \nBut I just wanted an excuse to keep talking to her because we had so many things in common and I enjoyed our conversation. Her story and how badly things have gone for her personal life ever since the pandemic. \nAt one point I remember her asking if this is okay (she was about to kiss me). I told her it was more than fine and we kissed. One thing led to another and we had sex in my car. \n\nWe saw eachother a few more times at coffee shops to talk over the next weeks until she told me she found a job an hour away and it was also close to a shelter until she could afford her own place to live. That\u2019s a little bit of our background story so you see how it got to this. \nFirst time in months she contacts me that she\u2019s over 4 months pregnant with our baby. It caught her by surprise and she says she was so stressed with work it didn\u2019t really hit her until she remembered we had sex. \n\nI\u2019m a little overwhelmed ( I have proof the baby is mine). She said she understands if I don\u2019t want to be involved with the way it all happened. I don\u2019t feel that way at all. It\u2019s scary but once I actually saw the ultrasound photo of our baby my heart fluttered. \n\nI\u2019m a dad. No idea how we\u2019re going to work this out but I plan to be there for my kid. Just wanted to say it all somewhere before the time comes to tell everyone else in my life",

I was a civil servant in a fancy white tower (literally lol) where I helped organize data resources for the effort to address homelessness in LA\u2026 and my disability only got worse and in turn my ex got my abusive. 37% of people experiencing homelessness are domestic abuse survivors. My \u201cfun\u201d facts did not prepare me for what I was facing. \n\nEventually I had to recognize I was not in a physical state that allowed me to work (functionally bed-bound) and that left me nowhere to go; after five years together he wouldn\u2019t let me stay if I couldn\u2019t work, my mother didn\u2019t bother to offer shelter for me and was physically abusive my whole childhood, my dad disowned me on the spot for being lazy. I have a spinal condition, they were there when I was born and for the surgery, they just didn\u2019t take my declining health seriously because they lived across the country and never saw me. My friends were all broke and couldn\u2019t shelter me without a job (understandable). I started looking through shelters\u2026 and was prevented from jumping out the 11th story window of my apartment several times. \n\nIn the end I just got lucky. My husband is an amazing and compassionate person; I had just wanted to feel understood regarding my health struggle (he\u2019s also disabled) and he ended up convincing me to move in. He nursed me back to health (well, as healthy as my dumb body gets) and weathered the storms of my traumas. I so everything in my albeit diminished power to make his life easier and less soul crushing (insane sleep disorder, he just won\u2019t fall asleep for 6 days straight, will nap for 2 hours and then is stuck awake again, rinse and repeat with only minor gains from medications). The world wore us down into puzzle pieces that happen to fit perfectly. \n\nWe are both considered completely worthless in the current work environment and are unable to participate because of the hyper-competitive features of capitalism (at least as it is realized in the US). Even in Europe we would be able to do sone form of work, even if it was part time or volunteer work. But we don\u2019t value that as much hear. \n\nApologies for the tangent, but I just want to provide a human experience of unstable housing environments and what it feels like to not know if you\u2019ll have a home to return to go with the rather stereotypical \u201calcoholic and druggie\u201d comment. If you think you are not at risk of homelessness statistically speaking you are probably wrong. Shit happens. Anyone can become disabled at anytime. Natural disasters remove housing stock. Hell, our economy is largely built around preying on the working class to give us the privilege of not dying in the street. Housing is a human right. The solution to homelessness always starts with housing first. \n\nNote: I\u2019m not trying to be aggressive towards you in particular. It\u2019s just concerning that so many people think the homeless are worthless and that\u2019s why they\u2019re there\u2026 or that those of us who can\u2019t work in spite of our best efforts are of no value to society. People are very dehumanizing and cruel.",

It seems like you already get along, shelters are not the best place nor the safest, a random roommate on her part doesnt seem ideal either for the baby's sake. If you can work well together and co parent and help until she gets her own place that seems the safest. What if there is an emergency and you are an hour away? What happens if she loses consciousness and who will make medical decisions? \n\nJust some food for thought, ultimately you both will decide what is best but a new baby is not easy at all.

It sounds as if she\u2019s got a good head on her shoulders, as do you. Why not see what could come of it? You never know.",

Consider that is a few years you could be settled in your own home with a  wife and child that loves you.  **Not** the worst thing in the world.\n\nBest of luck.\n\nEDIT:  I'm just imaging this woman being able to blossom when she gets a bit of stability in her life.  I can just imagine at some point your friends are bragging about their weekend conquest and you reply, \"We just lit a fire, crawled under a blanket and watched an old movie together.\"\n\nAlso: I would rather live in a trailer park with a woman that loved me than in a mansion with one that didn't.  Homelessness can be resolved not so much with a petty attitude etc.",

Atm, did anyone notice that it seems like she had no sex after him at all? She couldn't get why she may be pregnant until she remembered their sex. It means something. Nothing wrong with people who are always doing one night stands (I don't get it but okay). But not all people like that. If a woman liked you and one night stand happened, she probably REALLY liked you. It's probably a case here. Plus, some people do one night stands when they feel lonely, want to feel any type of love and sex is a surrogate of it for them. Obviously, I'm assuming and all. I'm also a woman who was close to one night stand situations for similar reasons. Either I wanted to feel loved or I really liked another person to be open for possibility to sleep with them right away. Luckily, that's never happened for me.",

I went from helping organize data and resources for homeless shelters in LA to having no where to live and looking at shelters from the other end. I was disabled and leaving an abusive relationship. I was ready to end it. I have major spinal problems\u2026 I knew I wouldn\u2019t make it on the streets, I has only gotten worse and was functionally bed-bound. \n\nThen I met my person; actually a colleague from school because I just had this feeling it would be healing to talk to him. We\u2019d traveled long and difficult paths apart to finally meet. Life had warn us both down in different ways, sanding the puzzle pieces that we were down to fit seamlessly with the other. I can\u2019t help but be sappy, he saved my life when he had no reason to but compassion. He nursed me back to health (well, as healthy as I get lol) and weathered the storms from my trauma, just as I made it my sole mission to make his struggles as comfortable as possible. We had a trial by fire, between my living situation, a health crisis he experienced early on, and then covid hitting and locking is in a room together. Turns out we are quite happy with that last situation as we seem to not be able to get enough of each other.\n\nSometimes, in all the chaos and insanity, things just work out right. We got married in November and are both happier than we\u2019ve ever been. We still struggle, we\u2019re both disabled and traumatized, life isn\u2019t easy for either of us\u2026 but I want to live. For him, but also I\u2019m starting to want to live for me too. \n\nCongratulations on being a dad. I hope how ever you figure things out your family is always happy and well :)",

It\u2019s an old fashioned idea but, maybe you could help her obtain employment or she could be a stay at home mom and take care of everything for you so you just have to concentrate on work? Many people are homeless because they have psychological or drug issues. Perhaps you could get her counseling? You kind of took advantage of a vulnerable individual\u2026. You need to ask yourself why you did it. Do you have a fear of commitment?\n\nShe probably thought you were great because you had everything together. It\u2019s also possible that you could help her become good enough to be your wife.",

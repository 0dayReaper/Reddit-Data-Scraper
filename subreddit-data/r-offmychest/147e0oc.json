It could have ranged from \"I don't want to live in a big city, I am happy in tiny tiny town\" to \"you don't get to work/have a life outside of him monster type stuff\". \n\nI'm not saying you're 100% wrong, but having sex within a year of being in a relationship is normal and every time you have sex there is a chance to get pregnant. The fact that he is having a kid says nothing about him and OP was vague in the OP about the reasons for the break up so a character judgement is difficult to make. \n\nAlso OP said it sucks that he gets the life they planned with someone else, unless OP was making plans and forcing the ex to go along with it then it's safe to assume they both wanted kids. \n\nOn the other hand I could be wrong with all of the assumptions I made above. I guess the moral of the story is, without concrete information making broad sweeping statements is not the right thing to do.",

A year and a half later I find out she got married to someone she met online. It was hard because I was still mad, I was over her already and didn't feel that kind of jealousy, but I was furious that she seemed to be getting a fairytale ending even after treating me like shit. \n\nBut as time passes by you let it go, or at least that's what you need to try to do, because even though I would love to tell you your ex is probably going to be miserable with a rushed relationship and a baby on the way (because come on, it does sound like it's gonna end up like that), the truth is that you can't depend on his fate to be ok, you can't keep granting him that control over your life. If this helps, someone gave me this piece of advice: Your goal right now should be to get better for yourself, so that even if karma hits your ex and they're unhappy, you won't care anymore, it won't matter to you. The point is not to wish they suffer, but to get to a point where they have no space in your mind anymore, and that freedom feels fucking amazing!",

Hes pantomiming a functional and healthy adult. 90% of the time, they dont actually learn or become a better person. They just adjust the narcissistic game plan so they are better at netting their main squeeze long term.\n\nHe got this one pregnant so she doesn't run as soon as you did. **That's pretty much it.** That, and the image of being a family man, is a great shield for being a shitty person. Its why wo many shitty people jump right into kids and marriage even though they ignore their kids and treat their wives like shit.\n\nThe only reason you care OP is because you stuck around with a man you didn't actually like because you *believed he had the potential to be a man you like*. Not because he actually was one. A lot of people fall into this trap. They look at the potential of their partner instead of saying, \"This is the man he actually wants to be.\"\n\nThere are good men who are a work in progress. Yiu rarely find them because good men who are works in progress know they need to focus their energy inward so they can be a partner they think their SO deserves. So its not unreasonable to love a man who is changing. The problem was *you loved a man who wasnt.*\n\nThis having a kid and settling down is reflective of the man you wish he was when you were together. While it is reflective of it- like I said, he likely is still a terrible person.he is not the family man who loves his kids and adores his wife that you thought he had in him.",

I wouldn\u2019t take him seriously in a relationship because of his work and he knew that. I knew he loved me but couldn\u2019t think of having children with him because of his work. Well, he ended up having to leave the state because of this work. He would come home every couple of months and we would be very happy together, then he left. After a while he told me he was engaged to an older woman. She got him a stable job in her field with remote work that she did for him while he learned. He was smart so eventually learned. She bought a house he lived in, bought a boat for him, basically took care of everything. He ended up marrying her \u201cbecause he was so grateful to her.\u201d I was devastated. I kept thinking that I should have tried harder to get him to go legit like she succeeded in doing. It took me a few years but I met the love of my life. My ex would still contact me whenever he was in town but finally stopped trying when I told him I was in love with someone. I nearly gave up after my ex because we were so right together in so many ways but my now husband is so much better for me. \n\nThe ex has two kids (I have one with my husband d) but has consistently cheated on his wife the entire time they have been together. Even though I\u2019m not sure he would\u2019ve done the same with me, I am still so glad that fate took him away from me or I would have never met my husband. I am happy and have a mutual love while his true loves are his kids. He has a great life but there is also a lot of emptiness in it as well. \n\nAll this to say, some people come into your life not to be there permanently, but to teach you what you really want or don\u2019t want in life.

I was with my last boyfriend for about 4 years(broke up Nov 25, 2020), and while we were together he never wanted to get married, but not even 4 mons later, he met a woman on Tinder. They got engaged Dec 2021, and then got married in Sept 2022. Did it hurt? Yes. Does it get better? Yes. How did it get better? Well besides having someone in my life at that time who helped me get through it, I just remembered all the ways that ex was a pain in the a**, knowing that she is probably dealing with the same s***, but also learning to be happy that he SEEMINGLY has found his fairytale ending, and I just keep believing that mine is just around the corner.\n\n I will say to not kick yourself for being jealous that your ex has found his fairytale ending if you are, because it's natural to want a fairytale ending and being jealous if your ex has found it before you. However here's the thing: social media only shows what people want shown. They don't show the dark sides or the \"behind the scenes\" moments. They don't show what happens before OR after the camera stops filming. So, what might look like happiness and contentment to you, could actually be just a fa\u00e7ade.\n\n So, I'd say let yourself feel your feelings, then move passed them and put focus back on your life, because as you said, you cut off contact for a reason. Remember that reason and move on with your life.",

She called and I pryed that information from her. Now, she's in a relationship with someone else. I haven't slept with anyone since March, or even been on a date. She was my last sexual partner. Her actions actually validate my feelings of her not really being in love with me. If she can jump from guy to guy, then into a relationship after saying all the I love yous to me, it wasn't real. For me, I did love her, I fought for us. I loved her kids. I was just supply for her fucked up life to feel better. Knowing this doesn't make it hurt any less. I think about the bond I had with her kid's every day. Sometimes, I remind myself of the utter disrespect she showed me. Then, I get a bit in my head about those small idiosyncrasies that made me love her.With that being said, I try everyday to live in the moment. When a memory of her comes up, I look at my surroundings and take note of the things happening around me. I focus on my work and try to go on hikes the way I used to before I met her. The last year and a half for me, has felt like a big waste of time. Fall, to winter, to summer, to another winter, and back to summer again. It feels surreal. But, it's all in my head. I'm dealing with this. Like a man is supposed to. She's distracting herself from her own reality with another relationship..She hasn't even given herself time between partners to self reflect. And I now see, that after her failed relationship with her kid's dad, that I was caught in her self destruction. Her own self loathing. I wish that I listened to my intuition and not have dived in so heavy in the beginning. But, that's something I have to live with now. She's gone. I'll never hear from her again, or see her kids. \n\nI don't have any kids of my own and I have decided to keep away from single mothers because I lost kids I formed a bond with. It's not worth it to me, to give so much of my love and energy to a person that will just discard me when things get hard. She never respected me. And a part of me is really disappointed in myself for allowing it to get this far.",

            "comment": "I had a problem similar to this too. My ex emotionally abused me for 6 of the 7 years we were together. And when I finally left and he got with someone new it wasn\u2019t really that he got to be happy or any of those other things. It was him posting on Facebook about all the stuff he did for her that he never would have done for me. He forgot my birthday most years and several of those birthdays I had to spend at someone else\u2019s birthday party. And then I see him posting all this stuff about his new girlfriend, and the gifts he\u2019s buying her and so on and so forth. It\u2019s not that I would ever want to be with him again. Truthfully, the idea of being with him again makes my skin crawl. But it was sitting there wondering what was wrong with me, what I had done wrong that he refused to do any of the things for me that he was doing for her. Then I realized that he\u2019s a messed up person and it was never me. He was putting on the front to make himself look good. To show the Facebook world what a good boyfriend he was. But I know better. We have a child together so I can\u2019t just cut him out of my life completely. The really sad part about it is that although I hate him, truly, I\u2019m his best friend. He comes to me to tell me about all the problems he\u2019s having with his gf and I\u2019d be lying if I said didn\u2019t get a sick satisfaction out of it. It\u2019s just a shame that his girlfriend is now having to deal with all the things I dealt with because she really is a nice person and deserves better than him. But it also solidifies that he was always the problem and he will always continue to be the problem.",

You left his sorry ass and he goes and gets the rebound pregnant - this is not winning, by any definition. \n\nI had a very similar experience. Fell in love with a guy, serial cheater, notorious narcissist, raging alcoholic. He was messing with a girl in Cali, two girls in Alaska, and me. And we were just the ones that he kept up with; I\u2019m sure there were girls he didn\u2019t bother to call again (or that didn\u2019t fall for his bullshit). When I finally broke the on-again/off-again relationship cycle with this guy, it made room for someone else to enter the picture, and this man has shown me the love I deserve every day since then.\n\nAs for the cheater, he married a girl shortly after meeting her, adopted her young son, and had a baby boy with her. I was salty for like two minutes; then I continued living the life that I had already been living without him for some time. But it doesn\u2019t end there. Last October, I found out that his wife killed herself. They were married for two years. He instantly became single father of two boys under 10 years old. My heart goes out to those boys whenever they cross my mind. I didn\u2019t know their mother, but I know my ex. He\u2019s not the type to turn his shit around for a female, including the he one he chose to settle down and have a family with.",

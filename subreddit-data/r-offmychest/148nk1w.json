They're bound by squishy rubber instead of metal\n\nThey've changed my life, I can finally write on the right side of a notebook without smudging the left or cutting off my circulation or leaving the marks on my wrist.\n\nThey're thin but you can buy packs of them, and theyre so nice to use \ud83d\ude2d\n\n(This isn't a paid ad, I'm just passionate about stationary and not being minorly inconvenienced while trying to take notes)",

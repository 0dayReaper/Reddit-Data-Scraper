    "postText": "My son is non-neurotypical. Lots of issues in school growing up and misunderstood by loads of people. Brilliant and kind yet different. His best friend is his cat and their relationship was beyond special. My son always said he wouldn't know what he would do if his cat died - he hoped it would be after he left home to go to college. He wants to be an aerospace engineer and would say he would be 'with his people' then so he would be able to better manage losing his cat.\n\nToday, he witnessed his cat die from a difficult yet rapid death and held him as we raced to the vet who could not save him from a massive stroke.\n\nI've been dreading this day - I can fight teachers, school districts, bullies and even his dad to protect him but I can't protect him from death. I too prayed he would be older to have more skills and supports to cope with grief and loss.\n\nMy son cried briefly and then turned to console me. He said he was at peace with his cat's death because he was going to use his cat's memory \"to propel me to be a more kind, and compassionate man\", \"we can only move forward, mom\".\n\nFuck - my kid is awesome and perfect just as he is.\n\nEdit: missed words, tense &amp; punctuation when I originally wrote this (I was crying) and now I am crying because your kindnesses. \ud83d\udc99",

They refused to let him be in advanced classes because of his speech and writing despite speech-language people trying to advocate for him. I had to get an attorney. One time the sheriff had to get involved. When he was 10, he was suicidal because of the bullying and had a panic attack that something happened to me, his sister or his cat that he would be all alone.\n\nHe has not had easy road but he literally is one of the most brilliant people I know (so is his sister). High school now is better now and we talk about future goals.\n\nI am sure when the grief strikes it might be hard for him again yet I'm hoping he can make meaning from all this. Thank you for your kind words.\n\nEdit: I know everybody thinks their kid is brilliant and special (as they should) but when I finally got the school actually give him appropriate services - his testing did demonstrate that he was 2e. His math skills and reasoning are off the chart, and his recall and vocabulary (not expressive language) are exceptional.",

FTB.\n\nI owe that sheriff so much because he stood up to the school district and had my son's back. It could have gone so so so sideways. Thank God I was able to quickly get an attorney to educate the school regarding disability rights and following a 504. I am a mental health professional and I don't have a large circle but a couple good friends and a couple great professional colleagues - I am so lucky because things could have gone so so differently. One day, I dream of going to law school to help others but I'm a little old and tired :)\n\nA momma''s love is powerful and luckily I have some good friends who helped me when I felt alone and discouraged.",

And by turning to console you, he attempted to mend his own sorrow by helping to mend yours.\n\nHe has not processed this situation. He needs to cry. He needs to let out every emotion, no matter how scary. Don't let him make the same mistake I did and just bury those feelings. Don't let him try and fix other people as a substitute for actually fixing himself. \n\nThis is a critical moment in his life. Take advantage of it.",

            "comment": "Oh god. I\u2019m an autistic woman whose favorite and best pet ever\u2014my cat I got when I was 7\u2014died from cancer when I was 20.  It was slow and painful for him (we did everything, but far too late, and only because I begged and kicked and screamed. I wasn\u2019t \u201callowed\u201d by my narcissist shit eater father to bring him to the vet because money. My dad also made bank. He just cares far more about money than his kids or a living creature. Stupidly unfortunate.)\n\nI still can\u2019t hold it in when I think of him (tearing up pretty bad now...)\n\nBut he taught me a lesson\n\nMy mom told me that when we had to put our dogs down that the dogs knew they were dying and were skittish and scared and seemed almost angry.\n\nMidnight didn\u2019t even care. He wasn\u2019t scared. He wasn\u2019t skittish. He was so innocent and loving that he didn\u2019t seem to even mind. Our last day together he just gave me so much love even after what he suffered. Because of his cancer he\u2019d have puking episodes and diarrhea accidents... my dad would lock him in the dark cold and unfinished basement and ever let him come up. I\u2019d have to visit him down there and it crushed me not to have him around constantly. But he wasn\u2019t offended, he wasn\u2019t scared, he just loved me, his person, seemingly unconditionally.\n\nIt is a lesson, I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s a cat... he acted more honorably in sickness than anyone I\u2019ve ever known.\n\nYour son is awesome. Tell him that. I know you know his acceptance doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not sad, he\u2019ll remember the cat forever. \n\nSome animals are just too good.",

                            "comment": "This is weird but:\n\nI saw a spiritual healer (totally unlike me and my first time) who said a lot of absolutely ridiculously precise things, but here\u2019s the point. She mentioned my favorite boy, a \u201cblack male cat\u201d, saying \u201che absolutely adores\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t blame\u201d me at all. Then she supposedly got this image of him wanting to dig his claws into my dad, I guess, who\u2019s just evil regardless, but she didn\u2019t know a thing about me when we started the session besides my name... I had to explain why my damn cat wanted to kill my dad \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \n\nCrazy, I know, and nobody has to believe it. But I\u2019d love to believe I have him as a little angel and that animals have some semblance of souls. I never really think about midnight anymore, but when I do, I lose it. He was so special. An absolute champ. \n\nI can forget and forgive a lot of things about my dad because it\u2019s over, I don\u2019t live with or have to be close to him, but to basically neglect my cat to the absolute point of abuse (midnight, a formerly average sized, maybe 12 lb cat, was FIVE POUNDS and couldn\u2019t eat at all when we finally tried to help him), knowing it hurt both me and my favorite pet ever, I can\u2019t forget. Or forgive.\n\nMy mom always said the same as me... he was so joyful and loving even when suffering, it was like he didn\u2019t know or care that he was dying, he just wanted to love... and we haven\u2019t had another animal like him\n\nSorry to launch into a weird story. I want to say you\u2019re an awesome mom for caring about what others call \u201cjust a cat\u201d and his relation to your son. Your son seems to be just an awesome person, super wise and well adjusted even while not neurotypical.",

There are things I can't forgive (yet maybe ever) either.

Intelligent, gentle, thoughtful and kind. He teaches himself quantum physics when he\u2019s bored and is currently reading \u201cAstrophysics for People in a Hurry\u201d by NDT. \n\nHe grade-skipped this year and is about to be the youngest child to graduate his primary school. I was a little worried earlier in the year because my Dad was dying of cancer, and I was massively concerned at the possible flow on effect it would have on his anxiety and ability to focus or even function at school. \n\nHe\u2019s blown me away. He cried, of course. But he was mostly upset for ME. As soon as I got home from the Hospice he was cuddling me and asking if I needed anything. In the four months that have followed, he\u2019s expressed relief that his Grandpuff is no longer sick or in pain. A few times when he\u2019s had a particularly hard day at school he\u2019s mentioned wanting to make Grandpuff proud. \n\nHe takes the hard parts of life and instantly sets to work on turning them in to positives. This kid inspires me every single day. I can\u2019t always do that and I\u2019m 33!\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve done a wonderful job raising your son, and you should feel so proud. I feel proud for you! These kids will change the world for the better someday.",

I slowly witness him forget us and become grumpy  . Eventually he began to lose wight, he was put on an IV . It was terrible to watch. Once we realized that he was losing weight and not gaining , we decided it was time to let him go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was there when they put him down. I did not feel much . I was relived he would not suffer anymore. I grief him through out the months he was most sick...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a week later I guess it all hit and I began to really mourn.

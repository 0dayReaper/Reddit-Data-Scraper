    "postText": "everybody wants to kill me. i\u2019m only 25 and everybody wanted to kill me. i feel too much, i feel for everyone, i feel for mom, dad, brother, i feel for my partner, i\u2019d feel for you if you had time to tell me about you\u2026 i freeze every time some shit happens. i feel heavy my head is too much for my neck and i feel the hands around my neck and the hands are mine and yours and mom\u2019s and dad\u2019s and the amount of time i think about dying cannot be even compared to this feeling. only thing i wanted was to give love and to beloved. why is everyone trying to kill me?? i cut myself for the first time when i was 12 i remember how it felt how i was not even shocked but relieved that the razor made 4 lines and how the blood made the water gathering in tiles of the shower lighter tones of red. vividly. i continued till i was 16. i thought i grew out of it but i thought about it for so long that when i couldn\u2019t bear to be myself, to be with you, to be with anyone it came back. it repeated when i was 21. it was not sloppy anymore i was cleaning well hiding more well. hell, no one would fucking care they didn\u2019t care when i was 12 their eyes burned more than the fresh lines. why would they care now? horror in their eyes but disgust in their tone. it was not for me it was for their mind. left me alone threatened when my life was on stakes. did they really believe that the cuts would stop if they showed me how disappointed they were while i was hiding behind the doors? in a hoodie in the middle of summer. on the bathroom floor because it was cold enough to tame the pain. did they really believe that? screaming on top of my lungs when i\u2019m sad now my partner thinks i\u2019m insane when i\u2019m sad do they really believe it\u2019s going to stop when they say express that out loud? i couldn\u2019t choose my family i couldn\u2019t change how they perceived me so i became this person hiding. became someone who was stuck in a ghost. faded every day and now i think about dying. i think about cuts getting deeper i think about warm blood and the relief everyone will have after hearing the news\n\neverybody wants me dead and \n\ni\u2019m fucking terrified",

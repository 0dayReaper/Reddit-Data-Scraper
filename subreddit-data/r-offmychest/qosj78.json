Travis Scott had the utmost power to stop his God awful singing and stop the concert to help each and every person who needed it.  I don\u2019t believe that he is truly sorry, I think he is only sorry because his true colors have now shown and it\u2019s all documented on video for the entire world to see.  I hope that he gets what\u2019s coming to him, severe punishment for his actions.  Nobody in their right mind would have continued on after clearly seeing an ambulance arrive through the crowds and after seeing a person completely blacked out right in front of your eyes as you are performing.  I have no respect for Travis and I hope that he is canceled and locked up for years.  I\u2019m absolutely sickened by this. He is a heartless soul that does not deserve any type of fame or the money that comes with it.  OP- you are a victim of this as well because you lost your friend and I hope you are okay, again I\u2019m really sorry for your loss.",

Not even two songs in the band told people to stop, got security and medics in to aid people and stopped playing for 10 minutes until they knew the crush stopped and people were safe. The events there were completely avoidable, I'll give people defending him the benefit of a doubt because I'm assuming they don't know how often this actually happens, but fuck. I'm so sorry. I had friends that went to the Ariana Grande concert, one that passed, it's heartbreaking to know they just went out there to have a good time",

Same thing happened again later when he saw ambulances trying to enter the crowd, and he egged the crowd on the \u201crage\u201d, resulting in the ambulances being jumped.\n\nI also heard from an EMT working at the concert almost no one was trained to do CPR (yes, as EMT\u2019s) because they hired individuals or something to cut costs.\n\nMoreover: Kylie and Kendall Jenner apparently walked passed a person being given CPR\n\nThere were also only 2 water stations for 50k people (ended up being 100k becUse he was encouraging people to break in)\n\nFinally, no one was checked for weapons/drugs at security RUMORED (but those who broke in CONFIRMED not checked, ofc)\n\nAlso wanna point everyone to the fact Travis got arrested in 2017 for similar shit, but then no one died - he doesn\u2019t care\n\nThere\u2019s more ficked up things and evidence he knew, but I\u2019m too tired to type it all up but twitter really has the answers. Spoiler alert: eye witnesses said 100 bodies were carried out (unconscious or unlucky few dead, and ofc he noticed such a large amount)",

How many people died at this massive fucking event? \n\nTwo.\nOne overdose, and one freak accident. \n\nTravis Scott and his fans were present for a length of time 7% as long as Woodstock.\nTravis Scott and his fans made for an attendance amount 10% of that of Woodstock. \nI have no doubt in my mind that it should have been statistically much safer than Woodstock.\n\nThis was 400% deadlier than Woodstock.\n\nThis entire thing makes me fucking angry.\nHow the fuck can you stand onstage for a 5 hour concert in 2021 and rack up a death toll 4x larger than that of a drug-filled 3-day megafestival? \n\nI know how.\nYou can fucking scream at your fans to fucking rush the stage. You can continue performing as people are literally fucking dragging beaten, bruised bodies into safety, only to watch as these same people are pummeled to death by your own fans.\nYou can be Travis Scott. \n\nI'm fucking appalled.\n\nIf there was any fucking way I could help, bro, don't hesitate to reach out in DMs. I may be young but I have experience dealing with mental shit like this. I talked myself out of shit and I've helped people and I'm not gonna stop. \n\nIf you need anything, just ask. Ask any of us.

It's not like we have never seen attendees being trampled to death at a festival before. It's not like this is something new. \n\n\n\n9 people died this exact way at the Roskilde festival in Denmark 21 years ago. Just as Astroworld, there were 50 000 people attending. When tragedy struck and 9 people were trampled to death in the frenzy of the Pearl Jam (who, to their credit, actually stopped the concert and told their fans to back off) concert, like all of Europe took note. Roskildes bigger standing sections are nowadays separated into smaller sections to prevent stampeding. Crowdsurfing is illegal in many parts of the continent. \n\n\n\nSo why was the safety so bad at Astroworld? Are people allergic to learning from mistakes committed previously?\n\n\n\nOP I'm very sorry for your loss, this was unforgivable.",

NOTHING! Not a single thing, he simply walked away and out of the building with zero fucks to give!\nWhen Morris was rushed to hospital, still, Scott didn't phone the hospital, or his manager to be. The person who put Scott on the map! Introduced him to over a 1000% industry ppl, promoted him to the hilt, called in favours for him etc.\n\nThen, Morris finds out that Scott no longer wants Morris as a manager. Why? Because he didn't want to be turning up with ( TI?) and see Morris flayling about on the floor!\n\nDisability has no place in Scott's world!!!! He stole music he didn't write, lyrics he didn't write to try to claim as his own. He's seriously not liked in Houston by those who knew him as the 'nice normal kid' before his head grew bigger than the fucking Solar System!!\n\nScott and any crew member that were told of the un-folding serious events and CHOSE NOT TO ACT UPON THE INFORMATION, (which is exactly what happened, numerous times) should receive Jail Time!\n\nIgnoring the deaths of these poor kids by not charging and  sentencing Scott and any member of crew to Prison time is a nod to everyone to say, \"Fuck it, not our problem, blame the kids at the concert instead\"!!!\n\nDoes the idiot really think that by getting HIS TEAM to write out and post on Insta or wherever saying sorry, that that will make amends?\n\nThese poor poor families who have lost their kids in such a traumatic way will be billed by God knows who, hospitals, ambulances, etc, then the terrible reality of having to Bury their kids, this isn't cheap for gods sake, it's expensive. Scott should be forced to pay ALL BILLS FOR ALL FAMILIES!\n\nHoney, I am so terribly terribly sad and very sorry that you are going through this, we all are. There is help if you need it. But please keep on talking out your feelings, your pain, your hurt your grief, your anger because believe me, keeping it all stuck inside of your head? Will not benefit you at all.\nThere are lots of ppl even on here you can ask for advise or help, should you need or chose to that can point you in the right direction.\n\nI'm so angry, furious, at the level of irresponsible behaviour behind this man during his concerts. It's time to face the music, but in a court room instead of your stage!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nR. I. P To all those young people. Xxx",

    "postText": "The morning after Memorial Day the company I worked for went belly up suddenly and furloughed all it\u2019s employees without a last paycheck. It kind of wrecked me emotionally for a while because I loved my job. \n\nSearched on indeed and found one job I really liked out of the 15 I applied to and had lots of room for growth within the company. But I swore my nerves got the best of me because I started noticeably sweating after the first question. Stumbled over a few words and felt like I completely bombed the interview as I left. Even cried in the car. \n\nGot rejected by the next job even though I felt like I aced the Zoom interview, which kind of disheartened me even further. \n\nBut today while shopping I answered the phone, and I just couldn\u2019t believe it. Like at all. Thought it was a joke or prank because there was no way I got THE job after how terrible I was. Words cannot describe how much joy I felt hearing her say that I was the best candidate for the position and they enjoyed how down to earth I was. \n\nCompletely mind blowing to me that this happened today. Hope someone else gets to experience this kind of sudden happiness.",

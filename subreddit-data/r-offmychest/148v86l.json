    "postText": "I\u2019m 17F, I had an *extremely* violent abusive mother who left after cheating on my dad 4 years ago.\n\nShe abducted my youngest brother who was 8M at the time, lawyers said we\u2019d never see him again.\n\nMy other brother who was 14M at the time committed suicide last year.\n\nMy dad is doing his best, he\u2019s the best father I could ask for. I think I won the genetic lottery with him honestly, which makes me feel even worse seeing his face every day, after everything. My brothers won\u2019t ever get to experience having him as a father.\n\nI was very close to my brothers. I miss them so much. It feels *extremely* weird being an only child. I\u2019m so lonely, and coming out my room I feel a chill go down my spine. It\u2019s so quiet, and cold. I don\u2019t even remember this whole year, being 16.\n\nI\u2019m a junior Muay Thai fighter and it\u2019s the only thing keeping me going. That, and my dad. Without those two I would\u2019ve killed myself by now too.\n\nI miss my brothers so much it\u2019s killing me. We used to hang out for *hours*. I live in a bad rough area and whenever something happen to a kid on the news it reminds me of them.",

    "postText": "I (27M) have been balding/losing hair for about 3-4 years now. I've probably lost 75 percent of my hair in this duration.\n\nThe mental stress that it has caused me cannot be put into words.\n\nAnd YES, I KNOW, that in the grand scheme of things this is not a big issue at all, as people face sooo much worse in this world, and this issue might seem like a minor one. I am not denying that. BUT what I'm doing here is being honest about my feelings.. (which is the whole point of the sub)\n\nMy life outside of this has been quite the roller coaster (in a mostly good way) for these past couple of years. I have progressed a lot. My external life has changed drastically (positive). I am becoming the man I always wanted to be gradually. I have achieved a few dreams of mine already too. BUT it just hurts me so much seeing my good looks (I've gotten complimented for my looks a fair amount of times in the past), hair, and attractiveness just go away like this, at this time :/\n\nIt's just that FINALLY life is getting better after years and years of trauma and turmoil (totally unrelated to balding), I am getting a chance to heal and thrive, and now this is the time I am lookin my worst :(\n\nIt is still not 'that' noticeable, and certainly the time where it comes to shave it all off is still about a year away I think (the thought of shaving it all off kinda makes me shiver)... But as someone, who has been staring at his hair a bit in the mirror daily for over a 1000 days now, it's become exhausting.  I'm at that extremely frustrating phase where you have less hair, but it's not that visible balding that you totally have to shave it off, but you are somewhere in the middle, and unsure, and no set style..\n\nAnd yes, I tried all the treatments and all (Finasteride, Minoxidil, etc) but my Derma said it's genetic, and best we can do is slow it down (which did work at first, but gradually stopped working). I just don;t have more mental capacity for this, I have much much bigger things in life than this... But Having that good hair day just used to set the tone at the start of the day back in the past and made me full of energy... That just went away..\n\nI don't really have the face shape or skin color or height to pull off being bald..\n\nAll of this has been immensely bad for my mental health.\n\nI just don't know. Maybe just looking for some support and advice on how to deal with this.\n\nPlease don't suggest therapy for this. I've brought this up in Therapy before and they laughed it offsaying it's not a big issue. I have been out of therapy now due to some reasons, and am looking to get back into it, but wait times are atleast 6  months, and it is highly unlikely I will bring up this issue (as I am ashamed of it)..\n\nPlease be kind, I'm kind down rn..\n\nP.S. Can;t really afford a transplant right now, and it seems like a scary procedure to me.",

            "comment": "You know what, you ARE allowed to feel sad about balding, and I think it IS an issue to be sad about. Too many people dismiss losing your hair, hair is a big part of identity, style and culture, so people who tell you not to care are just saying that because they're already bald, or never have to worry about it with their enormous self confidence and head of hair. It's a part of your physical look that's changing and you can't stop it so you're allowed to be upset!! But now comes the part where you deal with those feelings and then evolve, I think you should lean into shaving full bald, plenty cool celebs are bald. You can pull it off, and you'll look great, don't be scared about it. It'll rid you of looking into the mirror every day and running your hands through the thinning areas, and obviously, people wouldn't know you're balding.",

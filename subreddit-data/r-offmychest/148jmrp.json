    "postText": "A little bit of context: I am 20F, a sophomore in college and still living at home with my mom and siblings (my dad works overseas).\n\nFor as long as I can remember, my mom has been both physically and emotionally abusive.\nRecalling a vivid memory of when I was around 10 years old, my mom got extremely mad about something I had done while I was getting ready for school in the morning. She started hitting me, cursing me, and saying all kinds of hurtful things. I was crying and crying, and begging her to stop because I was gonna be late for school. I no longer remember the exact details of that incident but the sorrow and dread I felt still stuck with me to this day.\nFast forward to my high school days, my mom was overbearingly strict and protective. I was not allowed to hang out with my friends after school and I was forced to go home immediately. I was also not allowed to talk to boys and have a relationship. In the 9th grade, my mom literally paid for a school bus service to give me a straight ride home.\nDuring 10th grade, I got into my first relationship with a boy. I would only be able to go on dates with him after school because my mom rarely allowed me to go out during the weekends. He would walk me home; but only around the block so my mom or any nosy neighbors wouldn't see us. I would lie to my mom about participating in extracurricular activities for school but in reality it was to sneak off with my boyfriend. Looking back, it wasn't a very smart thing to do but I was a teenager with raging hormones and my mom refused to acknowledge that.\nOne night when I was supposed to be sleeping, I was on my phone texting with my boyfriend. Long story short, my mom caught me and yanked my phone from my hands. She locked herself in the bathroom and scrolled through our conversation. I was right outside the bathroom door having a full-blown panic attack while she said all sorts of derogatory slurs towards me. It was a traumatizing event to say the least.\n\nMy mom nags me for a lot of stuff, even the littlest things like using too much soap or shampoo, not being quick enough to do what she asks, etc. She criticizes and berates me if I did not do a chore perfectly how she wanted me to and insults me on the daily. She calls me dumb, stupid, brainless, you name it. She hit me a lot when I was a child and a teenager. She is also the same way to my siblings who are older than me. I cannot recall a time when she actually praised us and showed affection (but she always praises our cousins and compares us to them with no effort).\n\nI am now in college and I still don't have the freedom to do whatever I want. I still need to ask for her permission before doing anything or going anywhere.\nThere was a recent incident where I went to the beach with my friends without telling her. She ended up knowing and as a punishment, she is no longer allowing me to spend time or have sleepovers with my friends.\n\nI see people around me who are close and can share secrets with their parents. I want to be close with my mom but all the pain and suffering I endured from her over the years has made me distant. I try to understand her situation why she is the way she is; that she didn't have a good childhood growing up and that she's suffering from different illnesses and taking medications that alter her mood. I guess I care about her but I don't feel any love for her. I feel guilty about this. What should I do?",

    "postText": "I(m) was seeing this girl(f) for like 3 months. Everything seemed to be moving fairly quickly to be completely honest. But I felt okay with it and it seemed like she was fine with it too. We had talked about how quick things were moving. We would talk about the future, see each other multiple times throughout the week, had plenty of sex,  studied together, got into new hobbies. We had a ton in common. It was a lot for just a few months. She brought me to her place few times also and given her families low income situation we slept on her mother's  bed and even fucked on it. We had taken pictures together at parties and when we went out. Acting like a couple pretty much everytime we met up but it was never official. \n\nThis passed Friday I planned a whole day in LA. Breakfast, canals, Beach, movie, griffith observatory and dinner. Again we acted as if we were a couple, holding hands, kissing, taking pics. When we got to the observatory I waited until sunset to ask her about making things official. She said she couldn't. \n\nShe said it's because she still has feelings for her ex. That she likes me but doesn't love me. She had seen her ex the following day at a wedding and started to question things even more. So she called it off the other day. To be fair we both got out of a relationship about 2 weeks before we had met. We didn't even know each other before that and had met at a bonfire and got close at a bar after by dancing together. She says she wants to cut the romantic aspects of our relationship and just be friends because she feels fucked up giving me feelings while she still has feelings for someone else. \n\nNow I'm confused. Depressed. And all that. Idk what to think. Idk why we got so involved if it wasnt going to go anywhere. Everything felt so good when we would be together. Now I just question everything and I have work teaching children science. I'll try my best to make these kids see some light in their day though.",

            "comment": "Sorry to hear this. These things happen. In my opinion she needs to forget about her ex. It's not healthy to dwell on him (assuming there's no chance they'll reunite). Give her some time and let her know you're still interested. Perhaps after a while she'll change her mind and be ready for a real relationship with you.",

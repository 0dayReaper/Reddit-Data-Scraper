    "postText": "To start off, I just need to rant. This post may be all over the place. I am a 21f. This has been a trend since sophomore year of high school. I date a guy for x amount of time, we break up, they start dating a new girl. Within a couple months, she ends up pregnant. This has happened 4 consecutive times. Part of me feels upset but I know it\u2019s just related to past trauma and not having a family who truly loves and values me as a person. Another part feels relieved it wasn\u2019t me bc I know the type of father they would\u2019ve been if I had the child. I do know I will have my chance someday, and that everyone has their own timeline in life for when things get accomplished. However, I feel as if I am well behind my peers as they are having careers, getting married and shortly pregnant after tying the knot. I am still in school for my chosen career and single. I have decided to remain single and focus on healing my inner childhood trauma. I know the people I\u2019ve dated in the past did not heal from the things that caused us to break up (there were issues on both sides), so I know there is the probability of those same issues developing within their new relationships which may ultimately lead to their downfall. I do not wish that for any of them and hope all things go well. I harbor no ill intent towards the women and hope they have a smooth pregnancy and delivery with a healthy baby. \n\nTo add, I was pregnant but miscarried at 7 wks. He couldn\u2019t come see me the night of the miscarriage bc he was going to a party with his cousin, and then the guy told me, not even 18 hrs after, he\u2019s glad he dodged that bullet. We broke up shortly after.\n\nI just feel a bit heartbroken for the things I could\u2019ve had. But happy that I\u2019m not in that position. Lots of mixed, complex feelings.",

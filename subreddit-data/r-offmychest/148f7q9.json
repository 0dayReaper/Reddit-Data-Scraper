    "postText": "I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that I'm a narcissist. I hate to admit it, but it's true... and all of my problems - my depression, anxiety and my feelings of hopelessness, stem from this one simple fact; and that is that I'm just not special in any way; not exceptionally good looking, not particularly funny and interesting and especially not smart. I've always wanted to be special, to be better than others in some way; better looking, smarter, funnier etc., but I'm just none of that... I'm actually the exact opposite. \n\nI hurt people that get close to me and feel like a monster, or I get close to someone and they hurt me and then I feel worthless. My ex GF was an angel, she loved me like no one else did and although love, affection and a special, deep connection are the things I crave the most in this world, I ruined our relationship. I couldn't give her the love that she needed... I was too self absorbed. Nothing seems to feel the void inside of me, nothing is ever good enough for me and at the same time I am never good enough for anything. To be honest I am relieved that she is \"safe\" from me, that she can move on and find someone who actually loves her and appreciates her and makes her happy, because she truly deserves it. Me on the other hand... I deserve to be depressed, maybe I deserve to suffer, because in all honesty I'm not a good person. Although I don't want to hurt people , I inevitably do... I can never appreciate and love someone who loves me for who I am.  \n\nOne way or another, I push the people that mean the most to me away. But then when I lose them, I lose my mind and beg them to come back... if they do, the cycle repeats until they have enough of me and they eventually leave for good. \n\nI don't want to be that way, I want to change, I want to be a good boyfriend, a good friend, a good son and overall just a good person that makes other people happy... But I feel like I just can't. \n\nI am slowly ruining my life because of this and I just feel hopeless.... I am a perpetually unsatisfied kid, desperately searching for love and affection, but nothing is ever good enough... until it's gone.",

            "comment": "You already did one of the hardest steps in improving yourself: acknowledging you have a problem. \n\nIt isn't easy living with any sort of stigmatized disorder. The fact that you're accepting it and embracing what that label entails means you have a more direct route to identifying how to fix the negative side effects of your disability. You have a name for it, now join online support groups. Get yourself a rage outlet, like boxing or martial arts. Something physical where you can channel your rage (a common staple of NPD) that also physically improves your body. You'll have an outlet and you'll see physical improvements, which will help quell some of the narcissistic injuries you might sustain while working on healthier coping skills. This will help you alleviate tension for when you have to mask around others. \n\nAccept that some behaviors don't come naturally to you, like empathy. So adapt and practice relation. What about this person can you relate to something you *do* care about so that you show they matter to you ? Make subtle connections  to build your own empathy system as you practice active listening and understanding. Nobody else needs to know why you care but you. All that matters is you show the people you care about that you respect them as often as you can. \n\nAvoid people who trigger your unhealthy habits while you work on creating healthier habits. People with *untreated* BPD are the antithesis to people who have NPD because one clings and love bombs and feeds the instability while the other avoids and turns cold when overwhelmed. Try not to add more fuel to what you already need help with by adding relationship drama. \n\nWork on feeding your own ego without using people. This is a private activity so again, nobody needs to know you use this to sustain yourself while you improve. Celebrate your points of pride and remind yourself of your good traits as you see them. Things that don't hurt others.\n\nKeep an honest journal to chart your anger triggers. Also make note of areas where you improve so it doesn't seem like such a huge undertaking. Utilize a frequent, small reward system for your successes to essentially condition yourself into choosing healthier behaviors. \n\nJust small improvements to start with.\n\nEta: only you and a qualified psychological professional can say if you truly have NPD or not. Until you get diagnosed, trust yourself. You know yourself better than anyone on here. We only have the limited information you shared, but you have an entire lifetime of living in your own mind. \n\nNPD shares a comorbid of negative traits with a few other disorders, and people with NPD who want to improve, are capable of acknowledging they have an issue and improving. With continuous effort. \"True NPD\" is not only recognized by an inability to acknowledge negative behaviors. That's just a marker of someone not willing to self reflect, which is universal to any major disorder that has negative features. Just as there are unhealthy neurotypicals there are people with stigmatized disorders who practice self accountability and self improvement. \n\nMental illness is not a one size fits all approach. If you personally identify with this disorder, then that's where you should start with your recovery. Don't let others' biases discourage you from identifying your own similar flaws in order to work on them. You're the one with a front row seat to your own actions, not us.",

Everything exists on a spectrum. Most people are not trying to hurt other people but if you are approaching situations with the intent to hurt others you should seek counseling.\n\nEverybody has intrinsic value and deserves respect.\nHuman relations are not transactional. \nIf you can start to view yourself unique and accept that you have flaws like everybody else and be a little less critical of yourself maybe you can start to be less critical of others.",

Especially wanting to feel special or feeling like\" everyone's watching/judging you\".\nWhat really helped me was to try &amp; differentiate what things I picked up growing up while trying to identify with other people versus what my genuine outlooks and feelings are.\n\nI also struggled a lot with feeling like a bad person because I didn't have affective empathy .\nHowever when I learned about cognitive empathy a lot of things changed.\nI didn't feel as different or isolated.\n\nI also have diagnosed ADHD so some aspects of my personality could be viewed as narcissistic when really it's just the way I function. \n\n I have a lot of emotional immaturity from rejecting socialization and the dating world.\nBut once I started putting myself into social situations and realizing that other people are going through the same things I'm going through, it really brought me back down to earth. Also I find that documentaries are a great way to study people and understand vulnerability without having to get too close. \n\nIf there's something I don't like about myself and I can't change it I just accept it and if there's something I can then I'll try to put the effort in that way I feel the reward of self-satisfaction.\n\nAlso some psychedelic experiences really helped me dig deep down inside. It might be true though some people really do need to hit rock bottom before they realize that there's a problem and I feel like that had happened to me at a phase in my life when I was very impressionable.\n\nIt feels like the older you get the river runs deep.",

Yes, for Narcissistic personality disorder there is a spectrum, but you're on the lower end of the spectrum if you're capable of realizing all of this- and that shouldn't qualify you as a narcissist, maybe you can say you're in recovery if you want? Definitely get therapy, don't be above getting government aid or free therapy services. It will help you a lot.\n\nEveryone has narcissistic tendencies, they're evolutionary. Without them we wouldn't have popstars and sports stars. Or people who believe in themselves enough to reproduce and run into burning buildings. However, when it exceeds one's ability and tears others down, that's when it's a problem. Believing you're special and only other special people are on your level is the true narcissist. \n\nThere are pathological narcissists then there are people with more or less narcissistic traits, that society has lumped in with narcissists- Narcissistic personality disorder is the actual name of the condition. It's really not the same. If you can feel empathy for others and are able to humble yourself you aren't a full blown narcissist. \n\nThe fact that you've posted this shows that.\n\n(Edited for clarity)",

    "postText": "*I dont need any advice for this by the way, i just wanted to complain a bit lol*\n\nA while ago my mom asked me if i knew my sexuality yet. I thought it was great she asked and didnt just assume i was straight. She also tries to be as supportive of the LGBTQ+ community as possible, so i felt comfortable telling her I was aroace (aromantic asexual). However as soon as i said it she just said said \"okay.. well.. -*goes on tangent that in summary is just her saying i havent found the right person yet*\\-\"\n\nI could tell she didnt take me seriously. For a while after that, she kept telling me things that in short just mean i havent found the one yet and i will change one day. It continued until I told her it didnt make me feel great and she stopped. \n\nAfter she stopped, she just started pretending that i never said i was aroace. She went back to the jokes about me getting a boyfriend or making comments asking if we were dating or if i liked him whenever she saw me with any male friend. Even my female friends werent safe, one time my friend was over and my mom asked us both straight up if we were both lesbians and dating. We literally shouted in disgust that we werent and she just said okay and walked away, just to make another comment about it a few weeks later. After my friend left from a sleepover my mom asked why my blinds were open (i always keep them closed). i told her \\[friends name\\] likes to open it at night because she doesnt like the room pitch dark when we sleep. My mom then said \"Ohhh because its more romantic with the moonlight shining in?\" as a joke but it was SO WEIRD. and super uncomfortable. Me and that friend literally show zero signs of being in a romantic relationship/liking each other. Sometimes i think she just made it up because shes desperate for me to be anything but aroace. \n\nI havent told my dad because he is so uninvolved in my dating life it wouldnt affect him at all. He would probably just make a joke about how he thinks its great im aroace because he wont have to worry about me having sex or breakups or \"bringing boys home\" etc etc. Which honestly is a reaction my mom could have at least gave me instead of her hoping im wrong. \n\nI really just want to tell her everything. I just want to say that she needs to stop worrying about what *could* happen and whats happening *now*. Whats happening now, and whats been happening my whole life is that ive never had a crush nor felt sexual attraction. I didnt even have the right idea of what a crush was until like 6th grade. I went on a tangent one time with my mom when i was around 12, about how i dont think anyone should feel sexual attraction until 16 because you're too young otherwise. Which is a pretty big indicator i was asexual because i had no clue people my age at the time were capable of feeling sexual attraction until i asked my friends. \n\nIdk maybe at some point i will tell her that but im not sure it would do much. I know im pretty lucky, like i have great parents and things would be much worse if i was gay and had super homophobic parents or something. At least i feel safe. I just wanted to whine for a bit because i just wish she gave me the same support she would if i was literally anything else but aroace :/",

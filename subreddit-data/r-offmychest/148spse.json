    "postText": "You can check my history, you probably should. My posts are a lie. I don't lie for fun, it's hypothetical situation and I wanted real reactions.\n\nThe truth is I still love my ex after couple of years, I'm a bit younger than in my posts, I love him with all my heart and I have no place for anyone else. Feelings for him block me to love and be attracted to anyone else. I really tried to find someone I met good people but I didn't feel anything for them. I can't, I'm really blocked by feelings for him.\n\nI have been to therapy but it didn't help. Therapy works with your head and reason and it can help you understand yourself and your feelings. But it's not enough to actually change those feelings in the heart. I know better with my head yet my heart still feels the same.\n\nMany people told me to just settle for someone. So I made up hypothetical situation doing it.\n\nYou treated me terribly and I have to agree with you, it's a disgusting thing to do and I know it so I'm alone. And I see that in everyone's eyes I truly deserve to continue being forever alone because I just fell in love too hard. Do I? I'm so sad to be alone, I really need companionship. But I truly can't settle and do the disgusting thing I made up in my posts.\n\nAt least I hope you're relieved those posts are not real.",

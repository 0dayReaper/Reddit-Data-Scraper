    "postText": "My brother is 27 m, and I am 19 f.\n\nSo as long as I can remember, my brother has always done things that make me feel uncomfortable and bad.\nIt started when I was about 9 or 10, when he would say weird things like \"if I wasn\u2019t your brother, I would marry you\" or \"why are girls not like you when we get older? I need to marry you because you're so nice to me\" and would say I was perfect and stuff. He would try to lay in my bed with me and stuff, but it always felt weird, and I would get so upset because he would never leave me alone, to the point where I would cry and cry. I would tell my parents, but they would say I was making it up for attention, and if they did talk to him, he would get mad at me and nothing would change.\n\nAs I got older, he started to be more mean to me, and it got to a point where he wouldn\u2019t even talk to me (which I loved), but would be mean to me and my friends, even showing up to my middle school and making a scene just to embarrass me in front of my friends. When I told my parents, they again said I was overreacting or he was just trying to be a good brother.\n\nNow it\u2019s just horrible again. I\u2019m 19 now, and they still won\u2019t believe me that he\u2019s been making my life a living hell since then. Always starting fights with me, even when I was underage, to the point where we would get into physical fights and my parents would just yell at me and tell me to stop bothering him.\n\nHere\u2019s the most recent stuff: when I first got a boyfriend, my brother cornered me in a room in the house when my parents were gone and asked if I had had sex before. I was disgusted and angry that he had the audacity to ask me anything like this, and I told him to move so I could leave. He started to yell and demand I tell him, only for him to clam down after a while and say, \"I knew you\u2019ve been having sex; what does he make you do? Anything you don\u2019t want to? How was it?\" It was a horrible experience, and I just pushed past him and left. Once my parents got home, my dad didn\u2019t believe me, and my mom said it was horrible, but he\u2019s just looking out for me as a brother. He always gets mad when I spend time with my boyfriend and not him, and he always tries to guilt-trip me into hanging out with him while my sister doesn\u2019t really care what I do. The thing that broke my sanity is that today I got dressed up to hang out with my friends in the city, and I was wearing a shirt with a lot of cleavage (sadly,I have larger boobs nothing I can do about it), and he went insane, asking if my boyfriend is okay with me wearing something like that and why would I wear something so revealing! I ignored him and went to sit in a room waiting for my boyfriend to pick me up so we could leave, only for my boyfriend to follow me into the room and yell loudly that he could see my nipple and areola and that I should change and that I was nasty and it's disgusting that he has to see that (you couldn\u2019t see anything when I sat down, and if my nipple popped out, I would know). I asked him why he cares and why he is looking at my boobs so much, and he didn\u2019t answer my question. He only went on to ask, \"Who am I dressing like this for?\" and I said myself and my boyfriend since he likes what I wear, and my brother had the audacity to call my boyfriend nasty and other rude terms. I told my parents and my sister, and they just said he was looking out for me and I shouldn't be upset anymore and to let it go.\nSo I told my boyfriend all this today, and he\u2019s quite upset with how my family and my brother treat me and how my brother would say such disrespectful things about me and him. My mom knows I told my boyfriend, and she is mad at me because it \"makes our family look bad\" and that I should keep things like this to myself in the future. I\u2019m just so upset. Am I overreacting? Do normal brothers do this type of stuff? My boyfriend said he would never treat his sister like this and that my brother is a creep who may have a thing for me, and I am disgusted to my very core.\n\nI just wanted to have a nice outing with my friends, and now my mood has been ruined all day, but at least my boyfriend is nice to me and is on my side.",

Makes me think he watches a shit ton of anime without being able to separate fiction from reality.\n\nLike, a lot of brothers may worry about their kid sister, but he's way past the normal range. No brother should ask their sister about her sex life like that, it's fucking gross. Not to mention the overreaction to you getting into a relationship.\n\nEven the clothes thing... you're not a little girl anymore. You're 19 and can choose to show skin if you want to, plus, you're with friends and your bf, so, worrying about it seems excessive.",

Small bottles of pepper spray, hand held garden tools, bat/golf club, iron, bottle of spray cleaner filled with rocks, etc. \n\n\nI also recommend really starting on a moving out plan. If you're not driving but able to walk, look for housing within walking distance of different businesses if you can find it.  When you do move, do not give a copy of your key to anyone but someone who has no contact with your family just in case. \n\n\nYou've done nothing wrong. This is a them problem and if you need to talk to your partner or friends about it, do it. You deserve better than this. Wishing you nothing but the best!",

Also if you can therapy to help deal with it and learn what boundaries are normal and appropriate will help you in the future. When you have gone through being told abuse is normal it can become difficult to identify it on your own.\n\nAlso please make sure that for as long as you are living with him you have a way to securely lock your bedroom door and any windows. Keeping pepper spray on hand would also be a good idea. Maybe check with some friends and see if you can couch serf until you can afford your own place.",

There's been a few times he saw my boobs but it's not like he intentionally did. He didn't even keep it a secret from me either. Like 4 years ago he saw my boobs but I didn't even know but he told me he saw them when he had came home n I was making my way to the bathroom and he apologized and I just told him it was an accident and it's not that big of a deal. Another time I was like 8-10 yrs old I wouldn't get up to getting ready for school and my night dress or gown was a bit big on me. He came in the room and said I needed to get up and I just growled at him. He said \"YOUR NIPPLE IS HANGING OUT BTW\" and I was like \ud83d\ude2d. We literally joke about it to this day, and my brother is very protective of me but in a good way \n\nbut what your brother is doing he has an obsession with you and it'll only get worse cause he knows he has all the power as long as your parents keep giving it to him but you can't give him the power either. You need to cut him from your life completely, get a restraining order on him don't give a fuck what your parents have to say you're life and safety is more valuable than them portraying to be this perfect good family they clearly are so not and faking it to everyone around them",

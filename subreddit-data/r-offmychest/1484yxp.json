    "postText": "Fuck you for making me your dirty little secret. For being too ashamed of me to let me even hold your hand in public despite the fact we were sleeping together. You wouldn't even let us get a hotel room, and now I know it's because you didn't want anyone thinking someone like YOU would ever sleep with someone like ME. \n\nYou knew I had feelings for you but you kept leading me on anyway. Using me and making me feel never good enough because I didn't look like one of your arm candy girlfriends. \n\nYou're a monster. And you will go on to have a wonderful life with respect, money, and everything you've ever wanted. Because karma doesn't exist.",

    "postText": "Not sure what to do. I married someone I wasn\u2019t totally in love with as I didn\u2019t want to end up alone. As you can guess, this wasn\u2019t the best idea. I am now in a loveless marriage with a man who barely tolerates me, has little patience with me and is extremely critical of me. He is an alcoholic, which is my fault because I didn\u2019t fuck him enough. I didn\u2019t want to fuck him as there was always something I wasn\u2019t doing right or my \u201csex face\u201d was weird.\n\nAny time we have an argument my past transgressions or mistakes are brought up as part of the reasons why he needs to drink (he is also bi-polar). Apparently nobody else would want me or be attracted to me because I am a \u201chead case\u201d. FML!",

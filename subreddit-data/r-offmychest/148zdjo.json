    "postText": "major TW\n\nPreface: I am a smaller woman and struggled for 3+ years with anorexia. My partner was made aware of this within the first month of us speaking because it was a prominent issue in my life at the time.\n\nThe title of this post is self-explanatory. My partner and I will have been together for a year, next month. We disagree on many different topics; he has a very straightforward set of beliefs and opinions, I tend to stray away and am far more liberal. We have had our fair share of arguments and have tried to make it work up to this point. I have typed out this paragraph, deleted it, and retyped it again to try to best fit and emphasize how the dynamic of our relationship works over and over again. It doesn't really matter.\n\nTonight he showed me a post, of a woman that **we are both mutually friends with**, who was cooking a meal (that looked incredibly delicious I might add) and said something along the lines of \"I don't know why she posts so much food and is so confident about it when she's that fat\".\n\nIt completely disgusted me. My partner has said some outrageous and off-the-wall shit before but nothing with such undisguised hatred. I think that what makes the situation even worse is the complete hypocrisy that he faces, in which he has slept with numerous plus-sized women before we had gotten together (at least 3 that I can immediately name that come to mind that were the same size of the woman he was originally shitting on in this post).\n\n'But it's completely fine *right*? Because he found them attractive/wanted to have sex with them in that moment, their size doesn't equate to their worth or value, *right*?'\n\nI called him out for doing this and he immediately got pissed, turned over in bed, and told me he was going to sleep.\n\nThe more that I go in depth with this post, the more grossed out I feel. I don't really know what else more to say. I feel sad that we cannot share the basic human principals of respect towards others but this also seems to be what a wake-up should feel like. I am frustrated and sick to my stomach. ",

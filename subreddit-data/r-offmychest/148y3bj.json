    "postText": "I don\u2019t get it. How do people talk and converse with others, whether it\u2019s strangers, acquaintances, or friends. I FEAR talking to others, it makes me anxious beyond belief and my actions during these conversations make me feel like I\u2019m a complete fool. Jokes fly over my head constantly, so I developed this horrible nervous laugh which seems hard coded into me I just can\u2019t seem to quit it. When asked a question I freeze and my mind races searching for an answer sometimes I fall silent other times I stutter it out like an idiot, resulting in the other party laughing or not taking me seriously. At work especially, I\u2019m in IT and know my shit to a degree but I must come off as a buffoon to my peers at times. it pisses me off to no end, and all of that anger is at myself. That can\u2019t be healthy at all. I have no one to share my interests with, and when I am with someone who is, I still freeze up and have irrational thoughts pour through my mind. I want it to stop so bad but I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve even broken down sobbing mid conversation with a friend because I was so fed up with myself. I should feel comfortable around them right? Talking to them feels like a chore, I can\u2019t relax. I hate it, whatever this shit is. Am I autistic? Fucking stupid? Mental illness? I seriously don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve tried putting myself on video games online to practice convos but to no avail, most people I meet end up ghosting or poke fun at me. I can\u2019t argue, joke, or laugh correctly. The most I can do online is hold a superficial conversation and ask questions. I must be beyond boring to talk to so I can\u2019t blame people for their actions, it makes sense at the end of the day why they act that way towards me. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I guess i could try a drug but I don\u2019t know where to start. I have to talk to someone to even get them and that scares the fuck out of me. I\u2019m stuck in this constant limbo. Because I want to have connection with someone, FUCKING ANYONE. But I\u2019m still just me. I hope and pray to the universe that one day it\u2019ll click and I\u2019ll be able to talk without this crippling fear. To whomever reads this word vomit thanks for doing so. I wish you a good day.",

It's reassuring that there are more people out there like us lol. Do you think you grew up without friends ? Much social interactions? Low confidence? Were you told by your parents you are not good enough? All these factors can play a major role in the way you are because it puts down your confidence which is needed to be able to have conversations and function in society.",

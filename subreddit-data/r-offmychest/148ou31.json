    "postText": "I\u2019ve worked at this job for two years, I work the night shift so I\u2019m usually by myself for half the day, but I just found out that my whole workplace has a group chat I have never been invited to. They literally hired someone last week and they are already in it. If I had a way to communicate with my staff it would have made things so much easier in the last couple of years. It honestly makes me want to quit. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m not doing well mentally and I\u2019m taking it a lot harder than I should.. but due to other things in my work place  I already am feeling like I don\u2019t belong here.. do you think my feelings are justified or I\u2019m overreacting?",

I do get what you\u2019re saying tho. My workplace has done several things I don\u2019t appreciate.. like I\u2019ve had the same work shirts that are falling apart and they haven\u2019t gotten me new ones even when I keep asking and even said I\u2019d pay out  of pocket. We have a work list of chores that need to be done everyday by the whole staff and I\u2019m normally the only one who does them but if I ever miss something they talk bad about me. We work otp sometimes and you need training for it that was never provided to me so if I don\u2019t say it exactly right I get in trouble but when I tell them my lack knowledge they never provide me anymore training. I\u2019ve been here two years. Maybe I\u2019m just looking for reason at this point.",

    "postText": "This morning my boyfriend got home from work and called me a b and a see-you-next-Tuesday in front of our one year old daughter because I was \u201chaving an attitude\u201d. I was just being quiet and not bubbly in order to avoid stepping on a landmine because he was clearly in one of his mood swings; I admittedly may have huffed when he made a passive remark about me being \u201cbad\u201d at caring for her because she cried when I took her out of the kitchen upon his request. We share my car. I told him to get a ride to work tonight, because I was taking her to my parents\u2019 house. I said I wouldn\u2019t tolerate being called those names.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat do you even do? You do nothing. Know. Your. Place!\u201d in reference to the fact I\u2019m a stay at home mom. I told him my place was not with someone who treats me that way. He told me to ask myself if I was really being a b. I told him to ask himself if a good parent would call his partner that in front of their kid. \n\nThis man can\u2019t clean up after himself to save his life. I keep our home sanitized and spotless nevertheless. I match my daughter\u2019s energy levels, play with her all day, fill our day with activities good for her development, cook her a clean and incredibly healthy diet, and if I\u2019ve done anything right in this life, I\u2019m a good mom. But the new mom brain fog has worn off and with this new clarity, I have so much regret at my na\u00efvet\u00e9.\n\nToday I\u2019m taking her to my parents\u2019 house - they are willing to take me in. He doesn\u2019t have any time off left and said he won\u2019t get a ride. I don\u2019t care about losing our place. I don\u2019t care about him losing his job. I\u2019ve realized only now that not only is he a misogynistic creep to the extreme, but he has also strategically kept me from advancing my education, and for that, it will be a long and difficult road ahead. But I will do anything for her.\n\nPlease tell me this is right, or give me some better alternative. My head is spinning. Which is worse: the trauma of being separated from your father as a toddler, or having to watch your parents argue as he berates your mother? I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nEdit: Thank you all so dearly for these comments. They\u2019ve really fueled the fire under me. He\u2019s asleep, so I\u2019m packing some essentials before she wakes up from her nap, and then we\u2019re gone.",

There is absolutely no excuse for him to behave like that. He's a giant asshole and you are definitely doing the right thing - not just for you,  but since he's treating you that way chances are he'll abuse your daughter eventually as well.   You have to protect her at all costs.\n\n I know it's hard to leave a relationship, especially if you have a kid together.  But you and your daughter deserve sooo much better than that,  and you will be better off.",

Being adopted at an early age has probably predisposed me to unhealthy attachment, and also shed light on what separation from a parent can do to the developing brain. I guess I need to accept reality for what it is and do the best I can with what\u2019s in front of me. I appreciate the kind words. I just wish I had come to my senses sooner. I have already noticed some unhealthy beliefs he has when it comes to raising her, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be comfortable with him having partial custody. I suppose that\u2019s ultimately not for me to decide.",

It is far FAR worse to grow up in an abusive household than grow up with one loving, doting parent. \nYou have even said yourself that past trauma has set your standard of attachment and expectations.\n\nAsk yourself this- if your daughter told you in her adult life what you have just told us, what would you say to her? \n\nYou are not only doing the right thing for yourself, you are protecting your daughter from a horrific future.

He may even be the type to ignore your daughter; consider her innately less valuable because she is a girl; his whole attitude is abusive.\nETA: He has kind of tricked you, if he said it was important for you to be a full- time mom, not work, he'll take care of you both; an attitude that you don't need to finish school; these things make you dependent on him for everything, gives him an imbalance of power, especially if he is going to turn around and use being a SAHM against you! He has set it up where you depend on him and he thinks you are Nothing without him! He is so wrong!! He is selfish, he is abusive and controlling, and unappreciative of all that you do for him, for your precious child, and he doesn't seem to value you. It is the ultimate disrespect, his attitude towards you. You are stronger and way better than he appreciates!His mistake! You are powerful, and valuable, and he may be afraid that if you realize your worth, you will realize that you don't need him to thrive!\nEdit:fixed a word",

And maybe if you feel safe rn, you could wait until he goes to work, so you have more time to pack properly, please get a divorce attorney to guide you on your next steps, protect your child and yourself, good luck.\n\nETA: When I was a child my father was verbally abusive to my mom, after my brother was born she left him, when I was child and he was visiting (not often) I could see why she left with my own two eyes and two ears, I couldn't understand why I didn't wanna go with him for extended periods of time, I got really sick everytime, now in hindsight it was psychosomatic because as soon as I got home with mom I felt great again. So I do prefer growing up without an abusive person around, he never hit me or insulted me (that I remember of), but he made my mom cry, when I was in my early 20s I went no contact and never second-guessed my decision and I'm glad my mom left, I couldn't imagine growing up walking on eggshells and that is coming from me that I love being at home doing my stuff quietly.",

Additionally, leave him a note stating that you are leaving and taking your daughter (refer to her as 'our daughter' in the note) to your parents' house until he can find time to discuss custody (take a picture of said note in case he denies the note) and do one final clean of the house (take pictures as evidence of your ability to keep a home clean, tidy and safe for your child and in case he messes the house up and tries to cry neglect).\n\nRedirect all post/mail to your parents' address and lock down your credit so you have no reason for him to talk to you outside of your child. If your parents are willing, ask them if they can please get you a phone so you have one he didn't pay for and therefore can't control. Message all your contacts on your old phone that you are changing numbers and give them your new number (screen record this and send that to your email). Then, delete all contacts and get someone to delete all apps and factory reset the phone. Change all your passwords for emails and social media.\n\nFinally, be on your guard with him and limit your interactions with him where possible. Do not go back to his house for any reason. Do not get into any cars with him for any reason. Do not invite him into your parents'' house for any reason (if he wants to see his daughter, she can come outside instead of him going inside). Any phone calls should be recorded (inform him of this at the beginning of the call and that by him continuing the call, he consents to the recording). Any meetings he wants can be held in a public area. Any messages outside of your child should be met with one message stating that you are only willing to discuss matters relating to our daughter. \n\nThis man has shown you who he is: believe him. He is someone who will deceive to get what he wants. He might tell you that he is willing to change and wants a second chance, but that isn't true. He might tell you that you broke up a happy family but that isn't true. He might tell you that you won't find better but that isn't true. \n\nI really hope that this new chapter of your journey brings you happiness and fulfilment. Good luck, OP!",

    "postText": "I\u2019m so tired and so fed up. To explain the whole story would make this post painfully long, but the gist of it is this: I was married to abusive narcissist for several years and finally escaped after a nasty divorce. My parents, particularly my mother, gave me hell for it.. Said I was being dramatic, unrealistic, and selfish to leave him. That I was making the biggest mistake of my life to divorce him. That I might just end up bitter and alone someday.. all of this simply because he was always an absolute angel around her and she never believed me when I told her what he\u2019d done and what kind of person he was capable of being behind closed doors. I had hardly any support during that most challenging time of my life. Flash forward to today- I am happily married to a wonderful man and my best friend. She can see how much happier I am and how much he loves me and cares about me. \n\nBut she never. stops. bringing. up. my. ex. Updates on his life, trips he takes, a recent move, his new girlfriend (now fianc\u00e8),how they\u2019re expecting their first baby and so excited about it, etc. She gets all the details since she\u2019ll still friends with him on social media. And every time she talks about him, I tell her I don\u2019t need, nor do I care to know. It\u2019s never okay and far from necessary. I have moved on to a much happier life, while healing from the trauma he caused me. I\u2019m not sure what else I\u2019m supposed to do or say to make it clear to her that this can\u2019t keep going on.",

She doesn't give one iota for your happiness -- she keeps not only bringing up a abusive jackass, but she doesn't believe the abuse he put you through!!  THAT IS NOT LOVE. You need to decide what relationship you will accept from your mother who is being abusive as well.  She is happy to keep emotionally abusing you for kicks.",

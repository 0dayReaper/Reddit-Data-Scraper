    "postText": "I just need to get this off my chest somewhere since my husband thinks this is okay, and whenever I bring up the subject, he ignores me. I will try to keep this short.\n\nFor some context, my MIL used to go out with us every weekend and some days during the weekdays as well, she stopped a bit during the past couple of weeks. It was a relief to me tbh but she started again. It's not that I want to be an ass about the whole thing but she treats us like her assistants. \"Bring me this\" \"take me here\" \"I'm hungry, i want to eat this, take me\" and she never pays. \n\nWe have kids, she usually requests to go out in the evening right before the kids have to go to bed. Or she comes to our house to \"visit\" at 8 or 9pm, especially on school nights. \"Ohh I see you made food, serve me this\" \"oh no that's too much take some off\" \"make me this\" \"warm up my food.\" I'm honestly tired of the whole situation. \n\nWriting this down on here makes me feel a little better but doesn't fix the situation, there's so much more to this. I've asked my husband multiple time to please talk to her, he says he does but nothing changes.",

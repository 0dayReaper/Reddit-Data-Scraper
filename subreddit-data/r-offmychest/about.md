Description:

A mutually supportive community where deeply emotional things you can't tell people you know can be told. 

Whether it's long-standing baggage, happy thoughts, or recent trauma, posting it here may provide some relief. We'll listen, and if you want, we'll talk. 

We aim to keep this a safe space.

Rules:

We are good to each other.: We respect each other. If you encounter someone breaking this rule, disengage and report them.
	
We do not insult, antagonize, interrogate, invalidate, or criticize the original poster (OP), even when not directly addressing OP.

No oppressive attitudes and language.: We do not tolerate oppressive attitudes and language. This includes but is not limited to content we determine to be sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, classist, ableist, or intolerant of non-dominant religions.

Slut-shaming, victim-blaming, and body-policing are unsafe actions.

Suicide guilting is not allowed. Follow best practices when encountering people at-risk.

No proselytizing.

Promoting, supporting, and recruiting for groups that oppose our goals will also result in a ban.

We stay on-topic.: This is a support community. 

Posts must:

Seek only emotional support for matters directly related to OP and expressed in a way for people to provide it. No solicitation or material offers.

Make it clear how a topic is personally relevant. No soapboxing.

Be entirely self-contained text and contain no links.

All comments must constructively support OP. Do not give advice on posts flaired No Advice Wanted (NAW).

If a megathread exists, all related posts should be placed there.

We reject harmful behaviors.: No personal information.

No harassment. We do not mention non-public people, fellow users, or other subreddits.

We cooperate to build this community.: Report posts and comments that break any of these rules.

Moderators err on the side of safety. For all concerns about the community moderators will discuss it privately in modmail.
	
Being uncooperative is a distraction for OP and will be remediated in modmail.

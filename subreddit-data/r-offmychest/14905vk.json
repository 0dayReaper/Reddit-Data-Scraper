    "postText": "As the title says. We dated for a year, and the beginning was genuinely so wonderful. I was absolutely head over heels for him. He treated me so well. And then a few months in, he slowly started to change. I used to struggle being open about what I was feeling. So I started trying to be better about being open, and I think that genuinely was our downfall. Because anytime I would mention something he did or something he said had bothered me, it would always turn into an argument. He would yell, get defensive, make it out like I was attacking him, all the while saying he's \"always the bad guy\". Unfortunately, I already have PTSD for when I was a kid due to abuse. So when people start yelling at me, I shut down. Verbally and emotionally, I just go catatonic. And I've told him that before. But he would still \"Why aren't you talking?\" \"Hello?\" \"Are you going to talk to me?\" \"Can we just talk about this?\" \"Can you stop being disrespectful and make eye contact with me/stop staring at the wall?\"\n\nHe was showing all the signs that things would get worse. He'd claim to try and do better. But he never did. We had an argument one night ago, and it ended in him threatening me and threatening to destroy my belongings, and me having to call the cops. He threatened to destroy my belongings, because I kept telling him to leave. I had to keep telling him to leave because he was just standing there trying to argue with me, rather than just leaving my house. He only left literally because I was on the phone with the police. And I wish it never got to that point. I just wanted him to love me in a normal way, like he used to when we first started dating. But everyday it was a fight with him. Rather than giving me space like I asked him to, he would always just bombard me and make me upset and cause me to have a reaction of blowing up, and it would start an argument. I'm finally done dealing with it. But it doesn't mean I'm not grieving what we originally had. \n\nI live in a state 500 miles away from my family.. I'm not really a people person, so I don't really have friends outside of acquaintances from work and people I have added on Facebook. He was genuinely all I had. I would talk to him everyday, see him almost every other day. And the days when we didn't fight were always so nice. But now it's just been constant fighting and I can't keep doing it. And I feel so broken and lost. I was fine being alone before I met him. And now I have to try and get back to that point, but I don't want to. Because being alone sucks so much. I posted on my Facebook about what happened, and I had so many people reach out to me. But it all feels so fake and surface level that I don't feel like I can reach out to them and actually have some sort of friendship with them\n\n\nI don't know what I'm doing at this point. I guess I'm just venting. Everything reminds me of him, but then I remember that he doesn't treat me the way I deserve to be treated and it hurts even more because all I did was love him with my whole self.",

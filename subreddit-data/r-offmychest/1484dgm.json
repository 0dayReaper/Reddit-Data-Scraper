    "postText": "That I've had my heart doing the little flipping thing when a certain guy smiles at me. He's taken though.   It just sucks, staring this new job,  working so much that it's just work and sleep,  but it's a great paying one at least.  But it would be nice at the end of the day to get a hug from someone who loves me and believes in me.  It'd be nice to have a cheerleader. \n\nI'm not going after a guy that's taken,  it was just... nice having the heart flips and fantasizing until I found out about his relationship status.",

    "postText": "Along with the cost of insurance, car, gas, etc. being unobtainable for me for the longest time, I also had a car in the ditch incident happen last winter that gave me quite a lot of anxiety to drive for the longest time. \n\nBut a month ago I finished up college and got a job to set off my career, and just yesterday after a month of on and off driving I conquered my fear and passed my road test yesterday! It felt good passing it the first time around and all my anxiety about driving has died down immensely. I think a part of me will always be a bit nervous, but more so weary of other drivers rather than my capabilities to do so.",

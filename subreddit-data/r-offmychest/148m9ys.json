    "postText": "Throwaway account to protect any identity, but I really need to get this off my chest.\n\nWhen I was 9 years old I was sexually abused by my brother for the first time. My brother was 11 (almost 12) at this time, and the abuse continued until I was 12 years old.\n\nI remember that first time so vividly, he kept touching me and telling me that it was okay and it\u2019ll feel good. As a 9 year old I didn\u2019t understand what was happening or that it was so wrong. All I understood was that I couldn\u2019t tell anyone, my brother said that we\u2019d both be in serious trouble if anyone knew. He made me lay down on the bed and told me to close my eyes if I was scared, and then he raped me.\n\nI couldn\u2019t understand my emotions after it had happened, whether I felt good or bad. For the next week nothing was mentioned, but then he came into my bedroom one night and told me those same words before raping me again. This carried on for the next 3 years, multiple times per week.\n\nWhen I was 12 years old my mum walked into my bedroom one night and found my brother on my bed completely naked, right before he was about to rape me. My brother started to tell her that he wasn\u2019t going to do anything, but couldn\u2019t explain why he was naked. Over the years of both sexual and emotional trauma it was drilled into my mind that I couldn\u2019t tell anyone what had been happening, which meant that I had agreed with his story. I told my mum that he had rubbed his penis against me but nothing more happened and it had been a one off.\n\nAfter telling my mum, she sat me down and said that what he did was wrong but she put it down to his head not been straight with \u2018typical teenage boy stuff\u2019. We spoke no more about it.\n\nI am now 26 years old. I have carried the weight of this trauma with me for the past 14+ years and I have never been able to confide in anyone. Sometimes I sit with my mum and think about telling her that what happened that night wasn\u2019t the full extent, but then I soon change my mind because I can\u2019t even come to terms with it all still myself.\n\nThis has had severe implications on my life and still does to this day. I have never been in a relationship because I am scared to trust another person in a sexual way. I didn\u2019t have consensual sex until I was 22, and as soon as it was over I found myself scrubbing at my skin in the shower feeling dirty - even though it was consensual and with a guy that I really liked.\n\nI hate people touching me, whether it be a tap on the shoulder or a hug from a close relative/friend. Certain movies/songs/places trigger memories back to the days where I was being sexually abused. I find myself becoming easily angry or upset over small things and when I let these emotions out I get those memories coming through.\n\nMy brother has a wife and son, I still see him occasionally when I\u2019m with my parents. I\u2019m worried that if I lose contact with him that people will ask questions.\n\nI\u2019m scared that my sexual abuse will be a heavy weight that I have to carry on my own for the rest of my life. After all these years I still can\u2019t gather the strength to tell my story to someone who can help me. \n\nMy mind tells me that no one will believe that an 11 year old could do that to his little sister. And I think that no good will come of it because I can\u2019t see any outcome where justice will be served given the age of both of us during this.\n\nEvery year I tell myself that I will get past this and it won\u2019t define me, but after 14+ years it becomes harder and harder for me to believe. \n\nI worry about my future, and that I probably won\u2019t have a stable relationship or a family of my own because my body and mind won\u2019t allow it. My experience has taken so much away from me and will continue to do so for the rest of my life.",

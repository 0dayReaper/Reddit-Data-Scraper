    "postText": "Hi! I did something crazy yesterday.\nI entered a motel with my supposed suitor and we did things. I'm 22 and a church girl, i've always known that my curiosity will lead me to doom and it did. \nI cannot get over the guilt that i did these things behind my parents' back. They worked hard just to get me through college and here i was, lying on the bed letting an almost stranger do things to me. I'm too sorry and I probably will never get over the guilt.\nIf someone i know saw me yesterday entering that motel and told my parents, I might just probably kill myself.",

Your parents love you the same way, and I'm sure they would too... but at 22 years old, it's none of their darn business. \n\nDon't beat yourself up. Follow your heart and be kind to yourself. We all make mistakes and have regrets. Every day is a new beginning.",

You\u2019ve spent years listening to church and religion tell you that your natural desires re bad and dirty. As long as you are safe, consented and enjoyed your time with your partner you have nothing to worry about. Be safe, use protection and discover yourself and the thing you like. Do not feel guilty or think about your parents at all, it\u2019s your body and your life use it how it makes you happy.",

I don\u2019t go to church but I do know no one is perfect that goes to one. Everything one makes mistakes and that\u2019s ok. God doesn\u2019t expect us to be perfect that\u2019s why we need him. Just pray for forgiveness queen and everything will be alright. Curiosity makes us human.",

This won\u2019t make much sense because I\u2019m crying right now but I really need advice. \n\nHe\u2019s never cared about me or my mom or my dad, from the age of like 6 he would scream at my dad that he hated him, he\u2019s never been an older brother figure to me and instead he\u2019s just a bully, but he\u2019s never been able to be super mean because my dad was scary. My dad passed away in 2021, and since then my brother has been evil, mostly to my mom. He doesn\u2019t do anything around the house, he tells her he wants to kill himself, and he says such awful things to her.\n\nWhen I was 8 he sexually assaulted me, and he visibly showed no remorse, from then on I genuinely believed I wouldn\u2019t care at his funeral.\n\nTonight I lent him my charger, I told him I needed it back in an hour, he agreed. An hour later I tried to ask for it back and he refused to give it back, saying it was at 23%. He was on a call with his girlfriend. After some arguing I tried to pull it away and I got cut on it because he pushed me. He laughed, my mom got mad once I told her and we literally screamed at him to give it back and he did not care. \nI\u2019m scared I\u2019ll hurt myself tonight because of him and I don\u2019t know what to do, I genuinely have so much hatred for him it\u2019s unbelievable.",

Making me look stupid in front of people. Just being out right cruel. She's crazy, and not in a fun way. \n\nShe's always been like this but gives off this perfect, 'goody-two-shoes' persona, to everyone elae. \nIt's only close family (parents, siblings and partners) who know she's like this, and even then, they don't know the extent of it because i don't talk about it.\n\n And she's sooo fucking stealthy with it too. Little comments and remarks that no one else hears, and if I do end up saying something, then its *me* who was being the dick. \n\nI'm disabled and she just LOVES to remind me of how shit my life is and that she has an actual baby and another on the way. I can't have kids, she knows this. I got myself a pup, and I don't care if people hate it, he IS my baby. I'm his mama. (I have become a fur baby knob head \ud83d\ude2d)  But she also takes great pleasure in reminding me and everyone else, that he is just a fucking dog! \n\nI just try to avoid her as much as I can now. Which is easy because she lives a couple hours away. It's just shit that I can't spend time with my family without her being there. I even left my mums on boxing day this year, we were supposed to stay another two nights but I can't be in the same room with her. She's turning my little sister against me too, that hurts the most. \n\nSorry for my life story!!!  Must have needed to vent..\ud83d\ude33",

Don\u2019t act any different and make a plan where things happen that he can\u2019t explain and doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s you. He will slowly go insane. \nLike putting lil rocks in his shoes, sand in his bed(not enough for him to see), hide his things by putting them somewhere obvious but hidden, take a button off of some of his button up shirts( just one botton), dip his tooth brush in random stuff, put holes in every other sock, little tiny holes in his shirts so he things bugs are eating his clothes.",

Tell your parents to start parenting him. The longer he gets away with things the worse he will get. Document everything, avoid being around him alone at all costs, if you haven\u2019t already get a lock for your room, audio record all conversations (if it\u2019s a one party consent place) if he hurts you take pictures so you have evidence. If your parents refuse to do anything contact a family member you trust and ask if you can stay with them.",

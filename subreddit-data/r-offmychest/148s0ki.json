    "postText": "Im a high school student and I got an opportunity to stay at a university for a month (going home 2 days of the week) and have the college experience and I have never ever used the restroom in any public space other than my house when I\u2019ve needed go poop\u2026\nSince I\u2019m staying for 5 days in a row there was no way I could hold it for 3 more days. \n\nSo all of today I\u2019ve been holding it for 10 hours now 11 hours now since 6AM because I\u2019m sharing a form with 2 roommates I barely met and didn\u2019t wanna stink up the room so I\u2019ve been going to the restroom during class a bunch of time\u2026 hoping there was no one in the restroom so I could use the opportunity but every time there\u2019s been someone in there. \n\nI was planning on using the restroom in 1-2 hours when we are finally allowed to go to our dorms to take a shower. My plan was to go while my the shower water was running hot because somehow I\u2019ve noticed when I use the restroom that way it smells less?\n\nBut right now we came to eat dinner and I just couldn\u2019t anymore so I went to the cafeteria restroom (it\u2019s all the way in the back  I didn\u2019t even know there was one) and there was no one in there. I quickly used the restroom there and sprayed it with a perfume thingy I was carrying. Smell didn\u2019t completely disappear. So now it probably smells like poop and perfume mixed together.\n\nNo one saw me go out (I think) so I thought I was good until I came back to the table with roommates and one of my other roommates was heading over there. She 100% smelled it and I\u2019m pretty sure she knows. Plus people that work here saw me go in there too\u2026\ud83d\ude2d\n\n\nHow am I going to survive the next 4 weeks here? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\n\nBtw y\u2019all\u2026 when I say it stinks I don\u2019t mean \u201cobvious that someone pooped, light smell\u201d I mean \u201cOMMMMGGGGG EWWWWWW AAAAAAA\u201d",

Everybody should go regurarly to the bathroom like once a day, and I don't think it's that healty to hold it in.\nTbh I think we should be more chill and not care so much about what others think, because they probably don't even notice most of the things we do.\nThey probably don't even care on who did it lol",

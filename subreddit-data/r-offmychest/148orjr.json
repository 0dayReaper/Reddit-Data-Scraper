    "postText": "I dont understand. She broke up with me saying that her parents didn't Let her stay with me (we were a wlw relationship, she was bisexual) and also said the day before she got bored of me.\n\nI asked a very close friend whom we shared when did she get bored of me.\n\nAnd i got my answer. She said she never got bored of me, nor did her parents forbid her from seeing me, but she said she cheated on me with a guy from another school, and then felt really guilty about it that she broke up with me.\n\nI feel so betrayed and so numb. Why?? What did i do wrong? I know \"once a cheater, always a cheater\" but now i just want her back. I hate her now (she's been an asshole to me for the aftermath of the breakup) but at the same Time i want her back, even though i genuienly can't forgive her.",

    "postText": "We\u2019ll yesterday just when I thought things could not be worse got worse. \n\nSo over the last few years it\u2019s been kinda tough around my household.  My in laws who are good people fell on hard times and sold their house and I had to scrape together everything I had to get something to house my family. My wife has taken care of our kids while I did double full time jobs to make ends BARELY meet. And yea we had debts. \n\nObviously we were always going to struggle and have some money issues. I\u2019m not some crazy skilled worker nor am I super highly educated but we made it work and although it\u2019s tough the bills got paid.  So the other night I went to work to do my job (I\u2019m a school custodian).  Anyways I was cleaning the bleachers when I lost my footing and landed awkwardly snapping my ankle(can\u2019t walk) and bruising my ribs(harder to breathe).  Instead of thinking oh fuck I can\u2019t walk when I fell I thought oh shit I can\u2019t work I can\u2019t feed my kids, I\u2019m gonna lose everything imaginable and it\u2019s all my fault. \n\nEveryone says I\u2019m lucky to be alive. I don\u2019t think so. \n\nWorkers comp is 66%.  How does one support their family.  How does one keep their lives in tact with that?  Sad part is if I fell and was dead my jobs pay 3x my salary and my family would basically have been set.  I almost wish that happened\n\nIdk what the point of my post it 5ish am and I\u2019ve been silently in tears for hours.  I can\u2019t sleep, I don\u2019t want to eat, I just want a god damn Time Machine, or some magic healing device and go back to how imperfect things were before.",

But they will also calculate your rates to make sure they\u2019re correct and you\u2019re getting the most money possible. Hopefully a settlement can help put your family in a better position. Hope you feel better soon.",

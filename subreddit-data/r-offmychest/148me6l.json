    "postText": "\n\nTW: Potential CSA\n\nI 15M when I was 9 was touched by my mother at my private part.\n\nFor context when I was 9 I needed treatment on my private part, because I hurt myself there by my hypersexuality.\n\nSo one night my mother touched it. I don't know why, because I don't remember the details clearly.\n\nBefore she touched me she asked me about, if I can pull my foreskin back. I answered with \"no,\" because it hurt at the time.\n\nMy mother then decided to pull my foreskin back. While she did it for 1 minute she asked me questions like \"if it felt good\", \"if I felt strong\" and possibly I don't remember correctly \"if it was the first time I felt something like that.\"\n\nI don't remember how long it was, but it felt like eternity. I don't know why I felt like that, but I said, that I felt strong and good to the questions my mother asked, which I feel awful for. She then replied to what I said \"with yes it really does.\"\n\nI also remember something new. She talked about how I can't f*ck people, if I can't pull my foreskin back maybe she talked about that it feels so strong, if you put it in a women's private part. I feel dirty about this!!!\n\nAfter she did it she said she can't do it anymore because she will get in trouble. To this day she has an weird obsession with my foreskin and wanting to help me wash it, if I would say I can't wash it.\n\nShe maybe I don't remember correctly when I was younger \"helpd\" me wash me there and pulled it back, even if I said it hurt. She said i'm overreacting. \n\nMaybe she was even n*ked with me in the shower sometimes. I don't remember.\n\nI just don't know what to do. Should I call for help i'm not at home right now. I'm in a mental hospital, because of my (depression and self-h*rm), but their reactions to what my mother did, which wasn't the incident i'm describing now. Did already let me lose trust to them. I still have to go home one day in the week.\n\nI feel ashamed about what happened, because I felt good when it happened after it hurt. I feel so dirty!!!\n\nI feel so awful. I already in the last few days broke down crying because of it a few times. I also don't remember everything, because it feels it could have even been worse.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nI feel so awful dirty, gross and weirdly aroused while thinking back at it!!!\n\nI feel terrible!!!",

It is sensitive because foreskin has many more nerve endings. You will need to get used to pulling it back &amp; in time it stops hurting. If you don\u2019t, you risk illness &amp; disease &amp; overall having a disgusting penis because of the buildup of smegma. You may also require a circumcision later in life because you are unable to pull it back because it\u2019s grown too tight.\n\nWhen you get in the shower, pull it back slowly. As far as you can. Keep doing this everyday and ease it back further &amp; further each day until you\u2019re able to pull it back all the way. Wash with a warm washcloth.",

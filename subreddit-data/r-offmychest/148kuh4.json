You can't put Mother Theresa and Hitler in the same group. Or put the Pope and Timothy McVeigh together, is my point.\n\nThere are always going to be people who value power and do anything to obtain it, just like there's always going to be people pleasers and gossip folks.",

Cruelty, anger, and jealousy are human nature, sure, but so are kindness, empathy and love. The flaws of mankind don\u2019t negate the positives.",

    "postText": "I want to prefice this by saying I am a person who has quit cocaine. Quit nicotine. Quit ecstasy. Quit xanax. And quit Adderall. Also, English isn't my native tongue so excuse any discrepancies.\n\nI know I am a very strong person who has managed to overcome many substance abuse issues. And yes, I know that having in mind my history, I should stay off of any and all substances as a whole. But for some reason, even though I am now a fully functioning member of society, with hobbies and interests, these two damned beers are my only way of having a break, while simultaneously proving to myself I have control over things.\n\nSee, the thing about my type of addiction is that it was never truly substance specific. It was simply about overdoing whatever. It's like my life depended on a question and the next dose of whatever would find the answer. The next line, the next pill, the next bottle.\n\nI met my girlfriend a year ago. We were both absolute messes, bless our hearts. We live in a busy European metropolis and we both used to go hard whenever, wherever with whoever, while still managing to keep our jobs and friends. High functioning low lifes.\n\nLong story short, after two situations in which I got way too drunk around her and treated her awfully, my only way of keeping her was promising her I'm quitting drinking and joining an AA programme. \n\nI am now 6 months sober.... supposedly. \nI am actually not. I reserve a day of the week, when she's not over, to have my two sacred beers. The first one gives me my breath of fresh air, the second one allows me to have that \"beer smoke\" that's so popularly craved. And my denial of the third one, gives me power.\n\nI know I've come a long way, but every night in which I allow myself those two beers feels like a punch to my girls face and I fucking hate it. \n\nI do extreme sports as a form of escape from my drug abusing past, a free solo rock climb easily replaces a line or two, but I can't find anything to help me replace those two damned beers. And every night I fall asleep in fear of the day I let them turn into three.\n\nWhat do I do, friends?\n\nEdit: Clarifying I've never been physically abusive to my girl and that would never even cross my mind, matterless of how \"out of it\" i was. The situations were simply very disrespectful towards her. Which to me is reason enough to hate alcohol.",

            "comment": "This is my personal experience and opinion. I have no way of knowing how she feels or your situation. \n\nThat being said...\n\nMy current partner is a recovering alcoholic and has kicked some other tough substances like nicotine. His personal rock bottom was saying some awful shit to me while he was blackout drunk while we were on vacation. Like... he woke up (after I still took care of him all night) and when he did i just said, buy me a plane ticket home, we are done, you said this this and this and I can't do this. I only ended up staying for two reasons:\n\n1. He immediately started crying and I knew him well enough to want to give him the benefit of the doubt that what he said was him reacting to old trauma he was drinking about (we generally have a good foundation of communication). We talked and he made promises that he has kept. He also tripped over his own dick to earn my trust and make it up to me consistently. \n\n2. He is honest with me. He hasn't stopped completely, but limits himself to a couple every now and then (every few weeks or so on special occasions or events) and no hard liquor. When he has a couple on the rare occasions it's not with me, he tells me and we communicate. I'm not in the business of controlling people and I would rather he control himself and prove it to me. This is just my opinion and what works for us. \n\nBut if he told me he was completely sober and I found out he was having those couple drinks and intentionally hiding it from me, it would destroy any trust in him. I would not be able to live with that anxiety of what ifs the second he doesn't respond for a while or if something happens. Open and honest communicating is the only way our relationship recovered from his drinking. \n\nI am not in your situation, so I don't know the context or tell you what to do or how to handle it. But that is my perspective.",

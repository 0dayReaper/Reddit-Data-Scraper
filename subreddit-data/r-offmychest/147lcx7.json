    "postText": "NSFW for possibly TW language \n\nI  was 20 at the time (now I\u2019m 26), pretty confident about myself even though I\u2019ve been struggling with body confidence.  \nI was living at my aunt house when it happened, and his son, three years older than me, invited his guys friends for the night. They *was* also my friends. So, we were sitting outside on the terrace and I spent some times with them before going to bed. As it was during summer, I left my windows open but closed the electric shutters and I could hear them talking and laughing. And after a moment, I heard them talking about girls, I didn\u2019t like the way they were talking about women and at this moment, I realised I will not hang out with them anymore.  \nAnd then, they talked about me. I heard my name during a conversation about girls they would fuck or not.  \n\u201cOh, there\u2019s no way !\u201d  \n\u201cShe\u2019s ugly, but I still fuck her\u201d  \n\u201cI fuck her with a bag on her head !\u201d  \n\u201cYeah, I also put a bag on her head and fuck her !\u201d  \nThis is what I heard. There were other things, just as horrible, but that\u2019s what I remember most.  \nMy body is ok to fuck only if they hide my ugly face.  \nThey laughed, and continued the conversation.  \nI cried instantly.  \nI never had a relationship, and I think I\u2019ll never know what it is to be loved. This changed the way I see myself. I already have issues regarding men and my body, because of a SA when I was 16, I was feeling kinda better and kinda love the way I looked, but now it\u2019s over. It\u2019s been 6 years and I still think about it.   \nI\u2019m not stupid, I definitely know that this is not how all men view women, but stil is, I can\u2019t get over it. I know they are assholes and what they said is disgusting. I wish I would not take their words so seriously, but it hurts anyway.  \nI found some male friends who I like the company, with whom I feel good and confident. But I still have this memory that spoils everything. I have received compliments since then, and some guys appreciate me. But every time I\u2019m getting closer to a man I like, I can\u2019t think about just being a hole to him, so I get scared and take my distances with him.  \nSometimes, it\u2019s getting better. I take care of myself and my body, sometimes I don\u2019t feel that ugly, but this instant of self-confidence can drop at any moment. And I feel trash, not valuable and repulsive.  \nI\u2019m not living with my aunt and his son anymore, I don\u2019t see them and have new friends that are good to me. But when it comes to becoming closer to a man, even if I know he is nice, I get terrified when I think about being intimate with him, and cut ties immediately without giving him a chance.",

They were scared that if they admit they find you attractive, the other friends will make fun of them in immature ways (such as ooh you're in love with OP, she's your girlfriend now!). They probably were just being immature and didn't mean it.   \nAt 20, i had an emotionaly abusive BF who would do crap like this to me. He said I was sexy but my face looked like a potato, this kind of dumb stuff. He did that to hurt me and my confidence, so that I was afraid to demand being treated better and find someone else who can appreciate me.  \nI am 28 now but I still think about it sometimes. Luckily, it doesn't affect my daily life. I have a very loving boyfriend. I know i am not just a sex toy to him because he shows me he loves me by putting effort in our relationship. He spends a big portion of his time and energy doing things that are important to me, and I do the same to him. He wants to tell me things that he's excited about, tell me jokes, know my opinions about important topics, tries to impress me. This is how I know he means it!   \nPlease keep practicing things like self care, keep working on your confidence and self-worth and loving yourself. There's plenty of professional psychological advice online nowadays, but if you need some more guidance and help, go to therapy. Therapy is great! If it helps you feel more secure, try also educating yourself about signs of narcissistic or abusive behaviors so you can spot them in potential partners. This type of knowledge helps me. Please just take your knowledge from good sources, written by certified psychologists, psychiatrists, etc, not just any relationship coach on TikTok. :D",

I think they are well-informed and reliable, but at the same time they are not overly-scientific, but practical and easy to understand.  You can see who the article was written by and if it was reviewed by a specialist. They contain sources and references so you can follow them for further reading. I just google things like \"is my partner abusive/narcissistic\" \"how to improve my self esteem\" \"how to tell i'm being gaslit\" \"anxious attachment\" etc and I always find useful articles from these websites :D   \nI also like dr Kirk Honda on YouTube, he is a professor with a PhD in psychology and a therapist that specializes in relationships. I love his insights and I learned about understanding both other people and my own trauma from them. He also has a podcast too. Both the YT and the podcast are called Psychology in Seattle, I think. I also like Jonathan Decker. He's also a therapist. He now does lots of fun \"therapist reacts\" videos about movies but on his channel Mended Light he covers relationship topics too.   \nGood luck on your journey! Sometimes you may have a bad day or even month, and you may feel like you're taking a few steps back instead of going forward. But it's actually normal! This is part of the process of growing and learning. So keep going at your own pace, take breaks if you need, but never, never get discouraged. &lt;3",

No one deserves to be spoken about like that, even when they're out of earshot. \n\nSecond of all - beauty is 100% in the eye of the beholder. I am what you would call conventionally attractive. In light of this, my friends and family (not in a mean way, but) sometimes tease me about the types of guys I'm into. Because *I* am not attracted to conventional beauty - I like people that look *unique*. Not your Brad Pitts or Channing Tatums - I'm talkin' your Steve Buscemis and Pete Davidsons. And this isn't me trying to look like a saint or to morally grandstand; I GENUINELY am sexually attracted to unique-looking people. They are beautiful to ME. There IS no one beauty standard in reality. One person's ick is almost ALWAYS somebody else's dream spouse. My first crush was a very heavyset fellow, and my most recent ex was just as short (and weighed just as much!!) as me. \n\nMy friends consider my fianc\u00e9 to be my goofiest-lookin' love interest yet, but we're going on 7 years strong. Meeting him was the first time in my life I experienced love at first sight, and I have never met anyone whose looks turned me on more than HE does. I'm still deliriously happy with him after all these years. TO THIS DAY he still jokes about how he bagged a dime just by being funny \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I know it feels like such a worn-out sentiment, but it's true: everyone is beautiful to someone. \n\nNOT TO MENTION I *HIGHLY* doubt those *ssholes would've turned you down if you had propositioned them. I guarantee you they would have if they had the opportunity. In my experience, emotionally immature men preemptively reject you because they're insecure, and think they wouldn't have a chance with you anyway. So they say things like that to protect their fragile egos. \n\nDon't let their words get to you, because being \"pretty\" is only a small percentage of what makes you attractive to others. The MAJORITY of it comes from confidence. You're already pretty, and you take care of yourself, so NOW all that's left to do is to invest in/be kind to yourself. Walk with your shoulders back and your chin up, because you are worthy, and you must carry yourself as such. Reject any negative thoughts - say \"NO\" out loud if you have to (I do). Replace them with thoughts as loving and beautiful as you. At first it will feel forced and you'll feel like a fraud. But keep it up EVERY time it happens, and slowly you will start to believe them \u2764\ufe0f",

            "comment": "The opinion of some idiots is not your true value. \n\nFirst of all, your face is an amalgam of DNA of thousands of years. Could be the result of love, of forced marriage, or a cheating. There are thousand of ancestors, some who loved, some who cheat, some who were forced to marry. All that DNA has blended and created your face.\n\nSecond of all, you are not your face, you are your soul. If you do not believe in the soul, then you are the brain. You are what you do with your choices. You are your process and progress. You are your achievements. How many online people said that you\u2019re ugly, and stupid, and useless? Did them saying that made reality bend to their will, and now you truly are ugly, and stupid, and useless? OF COURSE NOT! We are not others\u2019 opinions.\n\nThird of all, how many people talk nice about you, and you never hear them because you\u2019re focusing on the bad stuff? Here is a tip: you have control only over your mind, and therefore your choices, and guess what? So do the others. Since you cannot control another, and another cannot control you, then there is no point in thinking about what they say. Why? Because you waste energy. It\u2019s like trying all day to pull a tree out of the ground. All you\u2019ll get is wasted energy and disappointment.\n\nFourth of all, all thoughts are made by you. They come from your mind, not outside of it. Therefore, your thoughts do not come to you, but instead you go them. When you understand this, the thoughts will go away.\n\nFifth of all, others\u2019 thoughts do not manifest in reality. Their thoughts, for example \u201ci\u2019d fuck her with a bag on her head\u201d, do not take human form and impale you, or kill you. Their thoughts do not take human form and come to steal your bed, your food, or your freedom. They are just that: thoughts. So if your life is not in peril, then surely you are not in peril. So let these thoughts go away.\n\nLastly, death can only take away your present moment. It cannot take your past, nor your future. Thus, since you cannot control the events of the past, then do not focus on it. Withal, since you cannot control the events of the future, then do not focus on it. Trust yourself and the reason/logic you posses. If you die today, then all the stress you have for the future events outside of your control would have been in vain. Thus, you must believe that, when the events of the future that scare you come into the present time, you will use the same reason/logic you have today to solve them. And if you can\u2019t? Then you\u2019ll have an opportunity to develop yourself, to learn something new, and to be better in the end. Therefore, when you are with someone, there is no reason to be afraid and/or to focus on the past or future. \n\nLive the moment, and surrender to the belief that all will be well. Hic Et Nunc.",

A guy who really likes you and wants to make the effort will try and talk through these things with you and hopefully reassure you about the way he feels which might help in getting closer and understanding he doesn\u2019t view you as just a hole.

If anything, it\u2019s more about them being insecure young men. It takes maturity and strength to stand up for somebody or call out the bullshit. It\u2019s easy to say something edgy in an attempt to be cool at that age. Some people will not grow at all, and they\u2019ll do the same later in life. Again, it\u2019s their issue. They feel like they are not enough, so they are trying to compensate. Or maybe it was just a dumb joke. Anyhow, it was not about you.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s been 6 years and you are still letting it affecting you. Probably you were never able to fully process it, because it was a random act of violence (even if it was verbal) and your brain can\u2019t draw a logical explanation for why did it happen. That\u2019s normal in some cases, and you should really consider talking to a therapist, just to help you put your mind at ease. It\u2019s all gonna be fine :)",

When someone loves into you with real love,  he loves into your personality, not your body or look. No matter how you look. No matter how smart you are. Only your personality matter. And as long as you are depressed, it will not happen.\nYou see beautiful women with rich guys: that is not love. They are not happy. \nPls go to therapy, heal your soul, and you will find that man who perfectly mach to your personality.",

There is so much toxic ego in those statements that only idiot men and insecure men speak like this. Confident and secure men who are put in these conversations like this will honestly just say that someone isn't their type let alone even entertain these types of conversations.",

It\u2019s good to talk about things and honestly people can be cruel downright ruthless but it absolutely matters more about what\u2019s inside and those people are ugly on the inside which is much harder for life moving forward. Everyone is beautiful to someone so don\u2019t be so hard on yourself even though sometimes that\u2019s difficult and it\u2019s okay to have bad days and feelings because that\u2019s normal but everyone has someone out there who thinks they are gorgeous and in any case no one can be absolutely stunning forever anyways. I hope you find a way to be happy with who you are and how you look more often than not because everyone has opinions but the truth is no one\u2019s opinion matters because it\u2019s different for every person the only one that truly does is yours about yourself. Just like how some people think they are more important than others and look down on people but no one truly is better than anyone else everyone is human and everyone from the homeless person on the street to the leader of a country is just as important as each other. Anyone can take there place with enough effort or lack there of because at the end of the day we are all just people trying to survive on a floating rock in space. People always question \u201cwhat is the point of my life\u201d what everyone seems to have missed is there isn\u2019t a point to life that\u2019s what makes it beautiful you get to make the point up yourself because it\u2019s YOUR life.

At 20 you\u2019re still very young, and boys are still boys - not men yet. Insecure little boys like to talk shit about others to make themselves feel better. \n\nA question for yourself, were these boys really attractive in your eyes? What did you actually think about them at that time? And even if they were, did that give them the right to talk about you like that? Why would you believe something someone said about you, when you don\u2019t even care about them? I can guarantee you that they don\u2019t remember this happening and that you\u2019re now punishing yourself twice by letting this rule your life. I know it\u2019s not easy to let go of traumatic experiences, but what you CAN do is go to therapy, meditate and work on loving yourself and those comments will not affect you anymore - trust me. You don\u2019t have to be a super model to be good looking to others. When you shine bright cause you feel happy, confident and good about yourself, you\u2019ll attract the right people. I promise you there\u2019s someone out there for you who will love every piece of you, but for now, try to be that person to yourself \ud83d\udc93",

In my experience about 98% of it is bullshit, and the majority of guys who say this stuff don\u2019t actually think it.\n\nI wish I could tell you an easy way to get over it, but there isn\u2019t really. I can tell you take it slow there is no rush, you don\u2019t have to be intimate with someone until you are ready. I can tell you that I would still marry my wife in a second if intimacy was off the table. Just getting to spend time around her would be more than enough.",

You need to work on your self steem and gain enough confidence to have healthy relationships with people and with yourself so even when that comments pop up in your head, you can sort them out. It's hard tbh, and quite difficult, but it's definitely not impossible. Take your time, don't stress over this (i know it's easier to tell it than to do it) and if you have the opportunity, maybe try getting theraphy.\n\nI'm sure it will all go well, just the fact that you could write what happened and be able to recognize it as something that haunts you is a big step tbh.",

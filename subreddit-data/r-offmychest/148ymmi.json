    "postText": "Me and my boyfriend have been dating for the past year and he generally has all the traits i look for in a guy and we pretty much have a very healthy relationship.\nHe\u2019s smart, very understanding, loving, caring, etc. \n\nHowever, there is one trait that i really dislike which is sometimes (and i\u2019ve noticed it particularly happens when he\u2019s around my family) where he would talk non-stop, interrupts others, and would not even care what others have to say, he would just go on and on and and on for so long talking about 1 topic only. \nThis annoys the people around him a lot and including me.. \n\nHe\u2019s rarely ever like this when we talk 1-on-1, but as i said, he does this around my family mainly and sometimes our friends.\n\nThings is, i did mention this to him months ago and he didn\u2019t realize he was doing that and got upset about it (which I understand), but, it really didn\u2019t get any better and I don\u2019t want to keep mentioning it to him because i don\u2019t want it to affect his self-esteem.\n\nI just need advice on how to deal with this and \u2018fix\u2019 him, and if I should be worried about it generally..",

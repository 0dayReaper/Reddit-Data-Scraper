    "postText": "I am getting tired of her\u2026.its not like she pays a lot for rent\u2026.its not even enough to cover any of the bills. I didnt ask for her to live with me\u2026.i was promised she would make up for what she cant in rent by helping out with chores but does she?!? \n\nShe doesnt even put her OWN dishes in the dishwasher just leaves them in the sink, she leaves her OWN garbage in my living room (ie opens her own package in my living room and leaves the trash there but takes whats important) , she doesnt contribute in groceries but cooks something FOR HERSELF AND WHOEVER SHE INVITED leaving my partner and i nothing, she buys shit food and leaves them in my fridge until they have mold, then she never tells me were in need of something until we need it\u2026.like we literally have a whiteboard in the kitchen u can use to write what we need!! \n\nTonight is the last straw!! I have told her so many effin times not to shower near midnight because my partner and I wake up from the noise and we get up at 4 am but does she respect that NO! I have tried to be understanding all this time but i am kicking her out idc anymore if were related or that she cant really afford rent. She never respected my partner and i even though we have been trying to be understanding but clearly thats not enough",

    "postText": "I am very confused at the moment and just don't know anymore where I stand. I'm not sure if I am being gaslighted or if I am being too sensitive. I'm not in a situation where I would say I am being abused but recently I have been questioning whether I am being too sensitive or if people around me are trying to gaslight me. \n\n  \nOn one hand, I am being told to voice when I am unhappy or something bothers me, but every time I do they downplay it. They try to tell me it's not as big of a deal as I think or try to convince me that's not what they meant. Both are things I have seen in loads of stories on here where people say that's gaslighting - I do know to take Reddit stories with a grain of salt though. \n\n  \nI guess I am just struggling with all of this so much because it's my family and in an ideal world they should never gaslight you. But I feel like it's happening - even though I dearly hope it's not the case. \n\n  \nSo back to my question, how do you know you are being gaslit?",

First they claim you can tell them your problem, but then they say it isn't what you think, that you are wrong etc. That sounds to me like they are gaslighting you.",

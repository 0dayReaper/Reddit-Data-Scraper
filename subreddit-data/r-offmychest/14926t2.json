    "postText": "My friend 20f is currently homeless and living out of her car. She suffers from extreme mental illnesses, severe trauma, struggles with sh and and ed. She doesn\u2019t have a job (she applies no one gets back and her car officially broke) she has no family, no one else with resources to help. The state isn\u2019t doing anything. She\u2019s been homeless for like 7 months at least and still hasn\u2019t gotten housing or any real help. I\u2019m not sure what to do. I\u2019m scared for her life. She\u2019s breaking and I don\u2019t know how to help. Please if someone can give me advice. We\u2019re in ni btw.",

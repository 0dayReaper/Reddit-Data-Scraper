    "postText": "I want to preface by saying I am really not trying to come off shallow or full of myself. I deal with a lot of confidence issues, and I never want to make it seem like I am better than anyone else because I know I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just frustrated and need a space to vent I guess.\n\nTo start off, I haven\u2019t always been a \u201cpretty girl.\u201d Growing up, I was very nerdy, shy, tall, and awkward and went through a lot of trauma which caused me to develop anxiety and depression. For the most part of my life, I didn\u2019t feel beautiful and I\u2019ve made a lot of strides to get to where I am today. When I was 20 I realized I didn\u2019t want to keep living a life in which I didn\u2019t feel happy in my own skin, so I made a lot of changes. I lost weight, grew out my hair, learned how to put on makeup, changed my style. I\u2019ve had people from high school not even recognize me today because of how much my looks have changed, and I graduated high school only four years ago. \n\nNowadays, my new look has garnered me a lot of attention. I don\u2019t want to come off as shallow, but I, by most standards, would be considered a very attractive woman. I love the way I look, and coming from someone who used to have horrible body dysmorphia, I\u2019m proud I can finally say I feel beautiful. But despite the way I look and an overall better outlook on my outer self, I still struggle with depression and anxiety. It\u2019s often hard for me to stick up for myself and I\u2019m still rather shy.\n\nGoing from an \u201caverage looking\u201d woman to a \u201cbeautiful\u201d woman has made me realize how quickly people will judge you on your outer appearance before they get to know who you are on the inside, and as someone who never grew up getting the attention I do today, it can be very overwhelming. Every time I go out with friends I get harassed, touched, groped, etc. I\u2019ve pretty much given up any prospect of getting into a healthy relationship because of how many times I\u2019ve been used for sex and then discarded. It\u2019s hard for me to make friends and I\u2019ve had many people go behind my back and call me snobby without barely even talking to me(I have an RBF and am really quiet so I come off stuck up). I work in a business setting, and I\u2019ve dealt constantly with people undermining my intelligence, talking to me slowly/repeating things so I can \u201cunderstand\u201d, calling me micro-aggressions like sweetie, honey, sweetheart. It\u2019s frustrating as fuck.\n\nAnd I sit there and take it because I don\u2019t have a fucking backbone, which just reinforces people to treat me the way they do. \n\nI reached my breaking point when I was in Spain a few months ago and was approached by a group of men while outside waiting for my friends by myself. They came up to me speaking in Spanish (which I don\u2019t speak well) and after trying to explain to them I don\u2019t know what they were saying, they just grabbed me and started taking pictures with/of me. I pushed them away and ran off, but once I was away I just cried. I am not a fucking piece of meat, and yet, that\u2019s how people see me.\n\nI\u2019ve done all this work to better myself, and yet, I feel like I\u2019m now seen as just this two dimensional person with no feelings, no brain, no personality. \n\nI know I\u2019ll probably get comments of people telling me I should be appreciative and that it could be way worse, and I want to say that I am. I know the challenges associated with being attractive are not as large as what could be the alternative, but sometimes I just feel like I\u2019m pushed in this hole of what is expected of me and what I am expected to take.",

It might take a few years to find someone, but be patient.\n\nYou might try different social environments. In my circles most people are married with kids by their mid-20s regardless of whether they're ugly, pretty or in-between.",

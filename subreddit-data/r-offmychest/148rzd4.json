    "postText": "So, it's been over a year since I left my wife over her long term affair. She's battling some MH challenges, and so on, so I have the compassion to at least make sure she's ok. I just don't really care beyond that.\n\nWe were together 20 years since we were in high school, no kids, married for 5, and then discovered she was with her coworker before and during the pandemic. I eventually had enough after finding out everything, and said I'm done. She's not in the best financial situation since I've carried her financially for most of her life, so I agreed to let her stay till she can save up and move on. I really don't care, so it's not an issue. \n\nThe challenge is she definitely suffers from vulnerable narcissism so she just has this need to be a victim for everything. I used to bite when she'd make some comments about me feeling like she's not trying to move, and she not trying to do better. However, through my continued education on how narcissism works, I realize it's how she's wired. \n\nSo my solution is to just not care anymore. Admittedly this is like a once every couple months incident, and she's hardly home now because her new guy (not her AP) is helping her apartment hunt, but the few times are annoying. Everything she does just makes sense now, so I can't react.\n\nAnyway, I'm just happy with my growth and realizing how to deal with her. She's going to be out soon, so I might as well hold on till then. I don't need to bash her, just not entertain her.",

I mean she does you no good by living with you and you definitely have no obligation to her after she betrayed your trust like that. I may be missing something but personally I think you should completely cut her out of your life if she does suffer with narcissistic personality traits.",

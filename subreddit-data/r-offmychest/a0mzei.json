    "postText": "There was a small moment where I thought 'that's okay, they're busy and I really appreciate that they came and had lunch'. That was when I noticed the package with my name on it sitting on my chair. Inside was a ransom note, a blacklight, and some random puzzle pieces. What followed was a four hour epic journey around the city, solving puzzles. This included a trip into a bar where the bartender said 'I've been expecting you', and handed me another set of locked boxes and puzzles as he poured me a whisky. Eventually  it finished at some accommodation they had booked for the weekend, along with the final address of a bar where everyone was waiting for me. They designed everything themselves. I was so utterly overwhelmed and humbled by the extraordinary effort they went to for me. These people are funny, smart, kind, and generous and I always feel lucky that I know them at all, let alone get to call them my friends. The world is a much better place for having them in it. \n\nEdit: I have been utterly remiss in telling you all how happy and stoked I am for how much you all liked the story of my delightful friends. I showed my said peeps who couldn't quite believe that anyone would think they were that interesting. Ergo, thank you! My friends are your friends so should you need us, just shout.",

Had needed to decipher a different clue to know to hit the book with the blacklight, every animal had something written against it but  the plate let me know that the camel and the giraffe were the ones to use. Super clever. That, and the pigpen cipher on a box which had a word lock. The clue was 'number two' the answer was 'poop'. We're not always grownup. :) ",

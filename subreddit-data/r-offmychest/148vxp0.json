    "postText": "Damn it\u2019s been a while my bad,  have been so tired and drained from work recently that I just crash whenever I get home, I was off today hence why I\u2019m writing an update. If you care I\u2019m doing good btw, still numb and content with life and just preparing myself for when I leave in 9 days, kinda nervous but excited at the same time. Hope everything is going well for whoever reads this and I hope you find peace eventually if it isn\u2019t great at the moment. \n\nI\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with my best mate so haven\u2019t been alone which is nice, also don\u2019t mind my own company anymore tho, I\u2019m slowly learning to love myself and haven\u2019t bothered with girls in over 2 months now and going strong. Just need to get back to the gym when I can find time too and start working on myself body wise again.",

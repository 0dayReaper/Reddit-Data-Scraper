    "postText": "I don't expect anyone to read this or reply I just need to vent and this seemed like a good place.\n\nI was at a really low point in my life, my wife had left me and taken our newborn. I was left with the debt and having to sell the house. \n\nThen I started to talk to someone online. I have always tried to be careful about how I interact online and I had no intention of anything happening, except maybe an internet friendship. So much for my intentions, we talked for hours, about everything. We told each other we loved each other two weeks later. Since we started talking we have talked everyday. We lived continents apart but after a year I went to visit them and had a wonderful week.\n\nThe last time we talked was like any other, good mornings, looking forward to our video chat, I love yous etc. Then out of the blue they told me the distance was too hard. We haven't talked since.\n\nHow do you act totally normal and even tell someone you love them then break their heart like that?\n\nTwo and a half years of talking sharing our lives and now nothing. They know about my relationship trauma, anxiety, and fear of abandonment and they just finished it and left me.\n\nHow do you talk to someone everyday tell them they are so important to you, tell them they make you so happy then just stop talking to them?\n\nThey said they couldn't be as emotionally entwined as we were without seeing me more. I would have come to see them, I did. They never came to see me.\n\nNow I'm questioning everything. Did I do something? Did they ever really love me?\n\nNormally I'd assume there was someone else but they are poly and I knew they had 3 other partners.\n\nI just wish we could be together. I wish I could tell them we'd work it out. But they asked for space and I am fighting being a toxic ex.\n\nI just miss them so much and can't stop crying.\n\nIf you made it this far thanks for reading this rambling mess",

This is the best thing to do grieve as you need to but don't stay in that mindset, once you're set and feel better workout, gain an interest in a activity or hobby, live life bro make the best out of a bad situation and stay positive, if you're still feeling sad talk to a friend or something, it's never bad to lean on someone when you're not stable.",

    "postText": "I (f20) truly have loved my boyfriend (m22), still do and don't see that changing anytime soon. It sadly has been a long distance relationship but we made ends meet somehow. Personally, I'm going through a tough time emotionally and financially. I don't get the time to talk to him and most probably, nothing is going to change for a year. I can see him longing for me, I can see him in pain. So I'll let him go. He deserves to be with someone who has time for him, someone who can take care of him when needed. I'm so sad that I'll have to let go of the most wonderful man I met. I'm breaking my own heart and boyohboy, it hurts.",

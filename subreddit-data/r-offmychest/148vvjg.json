    "postText": "My (f26) husband (m26) ruined one of the closest friendships I\u2019ve had in a while and I honestly don\u2019t know how to feel anymore. Here\u2019s a little background as to what happened:\n\nMy birthday was in March and he was supposed to take me on a date on that weekend (as a surprise), that Thursday our neighbors were practically begging him to go out and drink on Friday. He called to ask for my opinion since he wasn\u2019t really up for it and said he didn\u2019t want to feel tired the next day. I told him it was up to him as I didn\u2019t mind if he did go out or didn\u2019t. Friday comes around and he says he decided to go out. I told him to be safe and have fun. The thing about my husband is that when he drinks, he drinks. He does not know how to control his alcohol intake and will continue to drink until he throws up everywhere and blacks out. He finally came home at 6am and knocked out on the couch. I\u2019m not sure what the events of their night out was, but it ended in disaster.\n\nI am/was super close with my neighbor\u2019s fianc\u00e9. It\u2019s extremely hard for me to make friends, so the fact that I was able to make friends with her and have things in common was awesome. Our friendship developed pretty fast and we became best friends. We\u2019ll call this couple NB1. The other neighbor I am cordial with his wife, but wouldn\u2019t say too close (we\u2019ll call this couple NB2). So, back to the story. After my husband wakes up NB2 calls him and tells him he needs to apologize to NB1. My husband was confused and asked what happened, but NB2 just says that he threw up in NB1\u2019s truck. My husband called NB1 to apologize and offer to pay for the cleaning, but as soon as NB1 answers he says \u201cWho is this?\u201d He deleted my husband\u2019s number not even 24hrs after the incident. My husband says it\u2019s him and apologizes and everything, but NB1 wants nothing to do with it and hangs up. We were both extremely confused. We then noticed that NB1 deleted us off his Facebook as well and went NC with us. For months all I could think was how that was extremely childish because my friend even stopped talking to me. And my mindset was whatever happened between them shouldn\u2019t have affected our friendship, but I left it as is.\n\nA couple months passed and NB2 invited husband to go out and drink with him at his cousin\u2019s place. Apparently his cousin was also at their night out in March and spilled everything that actually happened. Apparently, my dumb husband was beyond the point of reasoning and said some thing extremely offensive. Husband basically told NB1 that his fianc\u00e9 was cheating on him when she and I would go to the gym. Which is an OBVIOUS lie, but now it makes sense as to why she stopped talking to me. And it didn\u2019t hit me until recently when I noticed that she just unfriended me on everything and I\u2019m not gonna lie and say that I didn\u2019t cry because I did. He made me out to be some villain in their mind that was trying to split them up and I\u2019m not sure how to get passed that. I know he was drunk, but just looking at him makes my heart feel heavy and I\u2019m not really sure what to feel anymore other than sick to my stomach.\n\nThanks for listening to my rant.",

Or blacking out daily. \n\n**Alcoholism is when the drinking becomes detrimental to a healthy, safe environment, the health of the drinker, and the health of any potential or existing relationships.** When he vomits and blacks out  while causing some kind of damage *every time he drinks* because his brain doesn\u2019t have an off switch - according to your post - *that is a problem.* If someone drinks once every few months, but during those sporadic times they destroy everything around them, especially in this salt-the-earth style, it\u2019s a form of alcoholism. \n\n\nWhat is he bottling up (no pun intended I swear) that seems to explode when he drinks alcohol? What does he think the alcohol allows him to do, feel or express that he usually suppresses? And why is he so malicious when it comes out? Why is Drunk Husband a dangerous liar??",

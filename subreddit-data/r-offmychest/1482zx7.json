    "postText": "My gf who lived together for several years left my home last week.\nShe left a hand written note saying that she is temporarily blocking me on social media and phone call for a week, and if we can still be friends, she want me to drop her a line.\nAt least in the note she left, she says she loves me, but living together is not working for us.\nHowever, she want me to be a FRIEND of her as I come back in touch. It's kinda confusing to me. How am I supposed to do?\n\nPlease feel free to ask more details.",

Have you been fighting more recently? Noticed any change in her or the relationship? Me personally wound want to know why my partner just up and left like that with no reason and on a small note? But that\u2019s me. But I think I\u2019d also leave her be. She clearly doesn\u2019t want to be with me anymore so why bother? OnlyYou can decide what\u2019s best for you!",

If you love her it's going to be hard when you see she's started dating other people.  At least it was for me.  Maybe the friends thing works if it's more of a mutual breakup.  So don't know exactly what you're thinking or where your relationship stands, could be different for you.  But what a shitty way for her to end it and then to block you and expect you to get back in touch for a friendship.  If it were me, I might try holding strong for at least a month or so and see what I'm feeling then as opposed to reaching out immediately after a week.",

I have a sister and she always talks to her with care and loves her so much but she's lately been more annoyed at me. \n\nGranted I can be pretty annoying but I always try to apologize after and do the right thing, but she seems to be saying mean things to me more often and wants me to intentionally hurt my feelings.\n\nI'm really sad because I love her and I care for her a lot but she's starting to treat me not like her kid anymore....",

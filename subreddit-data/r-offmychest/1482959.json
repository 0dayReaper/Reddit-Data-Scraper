    "postText": "I am an 18 y.o. girl, I study Illustration, but mostly work on video games. I recently picked up 3D modelling and am currently in love with it. I love learning perspective, color theory, etc. and challenging my art skills.\n\nThe thing is - my boyfriend is a programmer, I was always kinda interested in computers and technology as a child, but pursued my artistic nature, so I love hearing him talk about programming and just nerding in general. I admire how different our thinking can be and how we can work together, but I am a little sad that I am not as smart as him.\n\nHe taught me some basic programming, helped me get started with working with our game engine, I then by myself got around to said 3D modelling, which helped me feel more technologically challenged. \n\nBut even though I am a straight A student that gets praised for my art, I feel sad knowing that I'm not math smart, computer smart, engineering smart, etc. I tried some more programming recently and failed miserably. I tried listening to more technological videos and found out that I just don't have the tape typeof  thinking to understand it. I know that I can't be good at things right from the start, but I just feel...dumb. And I hate it.\n\nI feel like a lot of my friends are the smart ones....and I'm the artistic one. And that hurts to think about. \n\nI thought about purchasing electrical kits, something like Arduino, as maybe that wouold help me more, but I am scared that I'll just end up dumb. \n\nI also don't have math or any other logical subject at school anymore. Just art history, languages, figure drawing, economics, etc. I miss math tbh.\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't have much time, I am really busy, but I really want to get smarter and stop feeling so dumb. \n\nI don't want to live with the feeling that I am \"the artistic one\" next to \"the smart ones\".",

It's just that technology, math, etc.  are the things I find really interesting and feel sad for just not being able to make it click for me. Like trying to understanding it is just beyond my reach. Its dumb and I know it, but its been eating me for the past year.",

(which adds setting up materials, fixing up the model to be game - ready, etc) It is currently the only thing that makes me feel like I have found something that I want to do in the future as a job.",

            "comment": "People commonly take their natural abilities for granted and therefore perceive what comes easier to them as trivial or unimportant and the things that are harder for them as \u201c worthwhile\u201d and valuable. Truth is, just because something comes natural to you doesn\u2019t meaning is easy or that anyone can do it or that it is less valuable. Many people wish they could do what you do.  You are categorizing people that are mathematically inclined as \u201csmart\u201d and discrediting your own artistic intelligence. Read Daniel Pink\u2019s book \u201c a whole new mind\u201d. It is written by a person who is like your boyfriend who uses left brained analytics to show why the future belongs to the artsy right brained people. This isn\u2019t to say one is better than the other but that you need not feel inferior to anyone because you are just as valuable with your skill set and don\u2019t let yourself believe otherwise.",

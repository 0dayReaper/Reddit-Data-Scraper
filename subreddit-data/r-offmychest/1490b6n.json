    "postText": "\n\n\ni (15f) am really lonely. i have no friends or family members i\u2019m very close to. pretty much the only human interactions i have is with my siblings or with my mom. me and my siblings are not really close. i feel too young for my older siblings but too old for my younger siblings, even if my age gap towards them is just a few years.\n\ni think a lot of people will just think i\u2019m young and i still have a lot of time to make friends. but i feel like it\u2019s untrue. i have really bad social anxiety and have a speech impediment so the way i just talk comes off weird. its really difficult to make friends even when it\u2019s online. \n\nall i pretty much do is go to school, sit by myself, be quiet , listen and do my work until it\u2019s end of the day. hell, even my teachers barely interact with me. i just go home and sit in my room all day. its like i barely exist and just take up room and time. i try to go out ever since i recently got a new bike, but it\u2019s difficult because all i think is that it will just always be me alone. i always worry that people will see me and think they will be weirded out by me which makes feel isolated. sometimes i feel i can\u2019t even leave my own house. \n\ni\u2019m losing interest in my hobbies and other stuff i like. i feel like nothing can keep me happy or going for that much longer anymore. the only thing keeping me grounded are my two cats that i will miss incredibly. i wish i can talk to my mom but my anxiety always gets to me.\n\n\nif anyone reads, thank you.",

BUT you do learn that you don\u2019t always need friends. Social media made me believe that I absolutely needed an entourage of friends but its simple not true. Sometimes family is the most important bond. \n\nFind a hobby that you can invest and elevate in. I did photography. Became one of the top photographers in my town and made some professional friends through that. But high school and college gave me no friends unfortunately lol I didn\u2019t fit in with the social norms. Best of luck tho! \ud83d\udc99 you\u2019re always welcome to talk to me and I\u2019ll listen",

And I'm in my 20s, so I relate to your loneliness, all I have is my boyfriend and family. I'd like to tell you it'll get better and you'll find friends one day, because maybe you will who knows, you could go to uni and they'll just pop up. So have hope until then, but remember you need to try to put in the effort as well, try to work on your anxiety towards making friends so you seem more available to approach. Unless your mum is a bully, I don't see why she wouldn't be open to having a chat with you about your feelings, parents are meant to help you. Good luck.",

            "comment": "After reading that I'm honestly fighting back the tears. I fell like I've read a description of me at that age and so I can say without a shred of irony that I have felt what you are feeling. Lonliness can be crippling if you let it. I always felt I came off weird because I spoke very quietly. Really quiet, like it'd be '...say that again? What? Speak up, lad?!' And I'd be yelling at that point. People naturally just spoke over me and I ended up just staying silent. I am sure you will be given great advice regarding possible changes you can make, and join groups and whatnot, so I just wanted to write something to register myy support and to assure you that believe it or not, as big as the world seems, and so small the part of it that you occupy, that you have in front of you moments of happiness that you cannot even imagine yet; that, should you take charge, and perhaps take some of the advice offered here, your whole worldview will change and so will your view of yourself in it. I will advise one: Stop giving yourself such a hard time. You sound beautifully eloquant in how you write, and your spelling is lovely [I say that seriously! Some spelling is atrocious!].\ud83e\udee1",

I don't know about your country, but I know here there are companies all but crying out for bilingual people. That's a possible option for future employement. Have you got any plans past your schooling?; How does the school/college/uni process work where you are?",

But please look at in-person options\u2026. Even a part time job somewhere? \n\n\ud83d\udc97",

    "postText": "I feel so stressed out all the time. I want to leave for college so damn bad but I still have two more months in this shit hole. I regret taking a gap year. I've hated the entirety of the past two years. I'm so tired of having to do everything for everyone. I've been feeling so lonely with all my friends gone at school. I took a gap year and then the next year (now) I started to take online classes. It sucks so much having to go to work every day and being the youngest person there then to come home and spend what little time I can studying because as soon as I walk through that door I have to help out cooking and cleaning. Then when I finally get done with everything at 7 or later I haven't been able to relax since I've arrived home. I have organize all my parents appointments, pay their bills electronically, and remind them of everything because they're boomers that refuse to learn to use technology. On top of that, I have to take care of my appointments, my college work, my act study, my bills, my job, and myself. The last time I had the chance to hang out with any of my friends was in October right before Halloween. I just want to be around people my own age for once. I had covid a couple weeks ago and I can barely breathe right now. My parents are blaming the cat and want her out. They think she did it to me. After 3 years of her in my home she\u2019s the reason I\u2019m like this right? They act like they\u2019re fucking doctors and called me a stubborn child. How am I child when I take care of everything? How would they be paying their damn bills and getting to their fucking appointments without me? They just broke their lease and used me to get a new place. My name is on that fucking house and now they want to find their own place because I don\u2019t want to get rid of my cat. They\u2019re gonna screw me with a one year lease when I\u2019m gonna be in a college two hours away in two months. I have no one to ever help me. I feel so trapped in my own life. I don\u2019t feel like I have any freedom. I don\u2019t have time to do the things I enjoy anymore. I haven\u2019t drawn, touched my guitar, read a book, bought a new Rubik\u2019s cube, or watched a movie in over a year. My brother is such a spoiled brat. My parents were so strict with me growing up but he can cuss them out without getting trouble. I have to share a room with him and he lives like a pig. He takes his socks off and throws them on the floor along with his shoes and backpack as soon as he gets home from school or soccer practice. He doesn\u2019t listen to me. His parents don\u2019t care either. I don\u2019t know if I can keep doing this any longer. I feel down or frustrated all the time. I get stressed out so easily lately. I don\u2019t feel happy ever anymore.",

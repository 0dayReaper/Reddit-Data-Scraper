    "postText": "I\u2019m so fucking tired. \n\nI never have enough money for anything, I will only be receiving $63/weekly in unemployment benefits which doesn\u2019t even cover rent, I\u2019ve had to worry about possibly being homeless on and off since February of 2023 due to a job I was actually good at not being able to support my hours, it took me all of March and April to FINALLY find a job only for that job to let me go for a similar reason a month after hiring, I was hurt pretty badly emotionally in early March, I have NO FRIENDS or place to go if I inevitably do end up homeless since my parents are in a different state and OF COURSE I can\u2019t afford to take myself there. \n\nMy mental health is the lowest it\u2019s been since March and I genuinely have nothing else to give. I\u2019m low on funds, I\u2019m low on energy, I feel like a complete and utter failure and I get to watch everyone else in my family or friend group have fun and not worry about money. My birthday is soon and I don\u2019t even think I have enough money to even get me to where I need to go since my bus card is completely empty. \n\nI give up. I can\u2019t do it anymore. Idk what else to do. I hate myself and this situation. I just want stability and consistency for once in my life.",

    "postText": "I've tried to write this a lot.... \n\nSo I try to be a good person. I do anything for my family and friends. I always support them no matter what. \nWhen I start jobs I try to be fun and approachable, I do favours ,everything a good co worker does.\n\nI have never felt like I have true friends in my life... I have this feeling that people just humour me amd when I'm not there either dont care about me or worse mock me or talk behind my back. \nIf I dont contact people they don't contact me unless they want something.\n\nI'm married.... my wife literally stood up and made vows to me and even with her I feel the support only really goes one way.... \n\nI just always feel.... alone... unloved... not enough",

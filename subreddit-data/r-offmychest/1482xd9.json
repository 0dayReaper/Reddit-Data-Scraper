    "postText": "This whole reddit blackout that subs are partaking in is stupid. I get that you want to protest some changes Reddit is making. However, most of these subreddits are the only or most active communities for their respective topic. Example: Gaming subreddits, for any specific game. People go to these subreddits, not only to post about something interesting that happened in game, but also to ask questions and get help. IMHO, making your subreddit private or read only does more harm to the community than the possible good that will come out of it, especially since Reddit doesn't seem to care.",

            "comment": "'some changes Reddit is making' is making it sound so trivial.  \nStarting July 1st, Reddit will start charging for their API with an exorbitant amount. \n\n(API is how websites or services share information with each other. think of how you can login to a website or App using your Facebook Account, or Gmail, or Apple ID)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, one of Reddit's known 3rd-party apps called Apollo Reddit would have to pay around $20million per year with the new pricing. There's also apps for the visually impaired and other disabilities that will have trouble with the new fees. Reddit Bots use the API as well.\n\nwhy is reddit making the sudden change? my guess is because of AI.  \nchatGPT was said to have been 'trained' using reddit. Using a large chunk of user generated data that's already been categorized via the subreddit, post title, flair and comments.  \nCharging the companies using reddit to train AI would make a lot of money. But they chose to charge everyone",

I\u2019ve tried all the 3rd party apps and ultimately came back to the official app because the 3rd party ones just weren\u2019t as streamlined. Why don\u2019t these 3rd party people just make their own social platform if it\u2019s that big a deal I mean seriously",

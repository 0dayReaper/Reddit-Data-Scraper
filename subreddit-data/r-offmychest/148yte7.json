    "postText": "Here's a story, boys and girls.\r  \n\r  \nShe (33f) and I (38m) went to college together. Same degree, graduated together over a decade ago. Kept in contact with each since. Mostly over social media. Then stretches where we talk on the phone for hours on end for months where we really catch up.\r  \n\r  \nI've gone to her about relationship advice. Several times. Contacted her out of the blue about a year after not talking for a few years. All over a girl I had an absolute crush on. I wanted a woman's prospective. She's always seen to be the first option. She's honest, insightful, genuine, deep.\r  \n\r  \nTexted for a few days and that was it. Felt guilty about asking her advice. Thought I was a burden.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward to this April. I reached out on FB, apologized for being a nuisance for asking for advice. Couple weeks later, guess who reaches out? Asked me if I wanted to put our degrees to use and do a little sleuthing, as she called it. As I come to find out later, that's her way of getting her foot in the door to reignite conversation.\r  \n\r  \nSix weeks later, after several late night phone calls that last into the early morning hours talking about everything and nothing at all, I'm flying half way across the country to visit the girl.\r  \n\r  \nSo far out of my comfort zone. Yeah. Let's go visit a girl you haven't seen in a decade. Really out of both of our comfort zones. Me going on vacation, with the sole reason to hang out with a girl. She letting down her guard far enough after a nasty breakup to be willing to let visit and stay with her.\r  \n\r  \nOver the course of talking, up to and including the day I flew out to visit, she's mentioned we need to do a podcast. I'd be into it, if the felt right. We have a chemistry. Agreed. She being the outgoing, A-type personality. Me being, what I call the \"big dummy.\" Just follow along, \"yes, dear\" type. The underlying theme, \"are they a thing?\"\r  \n\r  \nThe four days we spent hanging out, it felt like doing a podcast was her way of getting me to visit and test the waters to see if the chemistry was legitimate. Whatever it is, we both felt something. Would we verbally admit to it, no. But you could feel it.\r  \n\r  \nWe spent four days hanging out doing next to nothing. Sharing food; sleeping in the same bed together; walking her dog, how'd we get to holding hands; tangled up in each others arms listen to music, tiktok videos. Who spends half a day in bed spooning watching tiktok? And how did I end up giving you an hour long back massage? It felt like we were a couple who'd been together forever, finally had a day off together and just enjoyed each other's company.\r  \n\r  \nThe big highlight, the last night we packing up her animals and drove an hour to her parents to house sit. Road trip. Tossed me her keys on the first day, you're driving. Talking, two truth and a lie. She's lived so many more lives than I have. Beyond intriguing.\r  \n\r  \nWe had our rough spots but they were far and few between. I get it, we're figuring the dynamic out. It's been a decade. We were friends in college but we weren't the \"go out to the bar every Friday night\" type friends. Then throw in the stress of house sitting a town she has bad memories of being sprung on her. On edge, a little more. I'll know what to look out for, watch my Ps and Qs. Noted, understood.\r  \n\r  \nThe last day was fun. Went out for breakfast, played those claw machines. Then out for ice cream. You could sense the two girls working there, had to being high school age, felt like my friend and I were more than just friends. Then the hour drive to the airport. Hey, my flight's delayed two hours. Guess we have more time to hang out, she says. Lunch time. The drive around the airport, looking for food. That wasn't stressful. Sit back, observe the two of us, you'd assume we were together.\r  \n\r  \nDrop off at the airport. Two kisses to the cheek, an Eskimo kiss (is this PC) and three full on kisses later, it was time to go. I'll miss you, we need to go this again. Hey check your bag, I left ya something. The stuffed animal she won at breakfast that morning.\r  \n\r  \nThe downside, another guy. A lot older than her. Late 50s. Great, competition. On paper, blows me out of the water.\r  \n\r  \nAm I interested, definitely. Is there chemistry, feels that way. But mixed signals are there. I want to pursue but I'm hesitant because of the other guy. I'm conflicted.",

Do it with dignity, confidence, and self assuredness, and accept her answer respectfully regardless of outcome. At least then you know. Don't let fear dictate the outcome or lack thereof, there are worse things than a woman you care for knowing you have feelings for her",

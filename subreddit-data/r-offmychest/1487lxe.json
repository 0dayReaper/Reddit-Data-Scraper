    "postText": "Society tells me that you cannot survive without AC, that it\u2019s a massive inconvenience to dry clothes on a clothesline instead of a dryer, that you need an SUV, that it\u2019s normal to drive hundreds of miles, that you need a big house, that it\u2019s better to have a lawn instead of letting natural plants grow, etc. \n\nEven though these things consume massive amounts of energy and natural resources and land.\n\nAnd if I bring another kid into the world, then that kid will need all those resources as well. So I\u2019d rather just not have kids and end my bloodline so that all these resources don\u2019t get sucked up.",

    "postText": "So basically a little back story I have 3 gaming groups I play with online. An there is a couple from each group that will also switch between groups with me depending on what game we are playing. One of the guys who did it was always giving us women a really bad vibe but we chalked it up to him not really knowing how to really communicate with woman. He would try to flirt and sometimes he\u2019d say something sexual other times he would be mean and it felt like elementary school again \u201cif a boy is mean to you it\u2019s because they like you\u201d. This guy was always pretty private even tho everyone in the friend group has known each other for up to 2 years some longer than that. After such a long time you end up knowing a lot about people but not this guy. All he ever said was he had been in trouble with the law and never would say for what. I found out his last name recently and after the sketchy vibes I decided to look up \u201chis name arrested state\u201d and turns out his state puts EVERYTHING that\u2019s public record online. I always felt his criminal history had something to do with SA I even expressed that to two of my closest friends in the group, I read the court transcript, the statement from the victim, I read it all. An it made me sick, without going into detail he SA a child under 10. An I started to not say anything to anyone but I kept thinking about it and I just felt sickened by it, all the flirting he would do with me acting like he wanted me to give him a shot for a relationship which was never going to happen but he knows I have a child. I told all three friend groups, I showed them screenshots most of them have blocked him. But I\u2019m torn was I right to tell them? There\u2019s this little part of me that feels guilty but at the same time I know I\u2019d feel guilty knowing the truth while everyone else was clueless.\n\nEDIT When I say we know a lot about each other we have all known each other long enough that 99% of us are friends on FB we have exchanged phone numbers we have moved our gaming friendships to real life, some of us have even met up and hung out. We send each other birthday gifts and Christmas cards. This guy was the only one who wouldn\u2019t share anything about himself besides vague information and his first name.",

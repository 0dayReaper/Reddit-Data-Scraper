    "postText": "So the wife and I have a long term friend named Ben. He's a kinda handyman tradie guy. No quals but just a general handy guy.\n\nWe wanted to get our house tiled and we were thinking of getting a professional but he's been going through some hard times in life and not finding regular work so we agreed to let him tile our house.\n\n We brought the tiles and supplies and he went to work over the next few days. He's a bit of a drinker but I was confident I could trust him. Well turns out I was wrong. \n\nHe must of been hitting the drink hard. The job was probably the worst tiling work you would ever see in your life. I was constantly tripping over raised tiles for 2 weeks and decided we can't live like this. Since the guys an emotional mess right now we didn't have the heart to tell him. We hired a skip. Ripped up all the work he did and paid for brand new tiles and had a professional tile it. \n\n It looks great. However,\nBen came around and was just asking about how the tiles look with the furniture back and started admiring his work. He has no idea what he put us through and now he wants to charge us more because he thinks it's worth more then the cash we gave him. Which yes wasn't much and it's not like we're low on money but he also wants to take photos and start using the work as advertising in his own new tiling business.\n\n What the fuck do I do here? The guys still a depressed mess of a human but I'm not gonna pay him more and I don't want him advertising work he didn't know he didn't do!",

Try to be compassionate, it sounds like you are. I think I would lead with a beer or the like, downplay the money aspect.",

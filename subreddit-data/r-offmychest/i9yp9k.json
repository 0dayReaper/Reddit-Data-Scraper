My depression has subsided quite a bit over the past two months just from stopping, which is great. So congratulations on your first week and don\u2019t forget to celebrate these things as it really is a big deal!!! Best of luck to you \u2014 if you can do 7, then you can do 8.

So i tell you this to let you know that addiction has a way of sneaking up on you after the first week or two and praise that could come with it. while it is an accomplishment you should be proud of, please be aware its still there and stay focused on your goal. you can do it, i know you can because i did. just stay vigilant and just keep thinking one more day",

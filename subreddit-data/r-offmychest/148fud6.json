I said my thanks and went to my room. then, I read on the wish note on it. and it says something like:\n\n\"for my dear son..may you always be given success in this world and the hereafter and always in the grace of God. may you get through hardship with ease. I love you so much. I'm sorry for not always being with you. I'm busy working for you. I hope you understands my situation. i love you forever.\"\n\n\nit was sweet but the moment I read \"I hope you understand my situation' I suddenly got like mixed feelings. it was anger, sad maybe or maybe upset? I don't really know. I am like in my numb moment. I got depression and stuff so I can't tell how I really feel but I know it's not a good one. \n\nit has been 4 years I guess since she busy with works and me the youngest and is still in highschool back then felt neglected more mad more. I clearly understand that she needs to work. I never ever try not to but I don't need to hear that. I just hope she just validate me at least. I know she would still need to work and just let me be alone at home. I understand that and I never really complain. can't I just sometime want she to come close and like hug me and rub my back and said \"I'm sorry for not be there for you often. it's sad right? it's lonely right? I understand. it will be okay.\" I just need to hear that but I never get it and she always been mentioning how I should understand she need to work. I just wanna feel validate about how she's not home as much makes me feel lonely. I just want her to take interest in my life. if I didn't mention it she wouldn't bother to ask and if I try to mention something, she straight out went to lecture me. back then I got like some sort of mental health and she doesn't bother to know and even say I got a demon in me. so frustrating.\n\nI know it can appear ungrateful or selfish of me to be like this or feel like this. I just feel sad and need to get it off my chest. thanks listening to me.",

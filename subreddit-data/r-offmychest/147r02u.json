Never been in a relationship by the way and never really took that interest.",

I know how it feels to be lonely.\n\nI'd also say maybe you could try and join some local sport groups/game groups or something to try and meet more people. Unfortunately in this age of technology, it does get harder to make friends as people may not be as social as they once were - so we have to try harder to get out there and make connections.\n\nWishing you the best of luck :)",

That's something I am still looking for.\n\nIt's feels good to know you were like me. Sports clubs and others activities would be a good look out for me to find more people. But hard to do with my office schedule, due to I only have Sundays off mostly.\n\nSo I spend it trekking by myself as it does make it feel OK for just that day. \n\nHopefully I'll find someone a partner or a close friend, one that will make me feel great, better than what I feel each day.\n\nThanks.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone :) 28F here.\n\nLong story short: I feel like I experience both avoidant and anxious patterns with same person. Maybe sharing my story will help someone by realizing that your are not alone.And I am hopeless to change it. I\u2019ve been in therapy for years, tried different therapists, it helps a little bit but I am still suffering a lot from my patterns.I experienced an emotionally abusive 2,5 year relationship with a guy 4 years ago. My needs were ignored, I was critiqued all the time, I felt so bad about myself, he judged my friends, gaslighted me, we fought a lot. Since then I did a lot of work and actually I am proud how independent and confident now I am compared to that time. That time I was fully dependent on him, all of my friends were his friends mostly, I built my life around him. Now I feel different: I have a still difficult but fulfilled life, I have a lot of friends in different countries, I went to study abroad, building my career, travel. I still struggle a lot with general anxiety and still feel often loneliness, but most of the times I am able to cope with that.\n\nNow I went abroad to study in Uni for one year. I have no future plans what I will do after that (there are some reasons for that). I decided that I want to try dating again, just for fun at least. Through this 4 years after that big break up I dated guys, but only short term.I met a guy (31M) on dating app and I was like: OMG how it is possible, this person is not playing games and is SO good at communication. I had a sympathy for him too, but I am a person who is very careful in the beginning and I was a little bit confused. Generally he was affectionate and showed me a lot of interest (though not too much, not texting everyday for example). But I felt really good, safe and comfortable with him. We have a lot of common interests, we understand each other so easily, we clicked, we have a common sense of humor. But my mind went crazy at some point to avoidant pattern: like I was scared that he wants a lot from me and maybe I felt that I can hurt him, and generally had a feeling like why he likes me, what\u2019s wrong with him (know that it\u2019s stupid). We talked that he doesn\u2019t have expectations from me, but I felt that he does with my gut somehow. So I got scared and one evening I messed everything up by telling stupid things like that I can\u2019t give him that he wants etc, saying I have no feelings. And\u2026 he suggested just having sex like FWB. I agreed. At that point I felt like this a right decision. I craved intimacy, but I didn\u2019t want to plan anything because of the turbulence in my life. \n\nHe also went away for one month so we were on distance after that. He said later than me saying all this hurt him and he was earlier in doubts but then took this opportunity to try to live in other city for some time for himself.And then\u2026. once he was away for one week my mind went crazy again. I started to MISS him very much. HAHA so pathetic, i told myself. But he really changed his approach to me to be more cold and protect himself. I missed him like crazy and started texting him a lot. We spoke and he seemed to be understanding and warm when we spoke, but still I felt not seen and abandoned. So at this point I changed to anxious pattern. \n\nSo after this long break we met again. I was actually over with my feelings and felt like I am in control and I won\u2019t fall again in this trap. I just wanted to have that amazing sex we had before. But my anxious pattern returned again. The problem is I still like so many things about him, and that he hears me and and generally i talked about this with him and he seems to understand me and to be willing not to hurt me. We said he is really sorry for all this and acknowledges that he took this distance as a defense mechanism. He is not gaslighting me and takes my feelings seriously. But I still feel bad.The problem is that\u2019s actually what I wanted: free relationship. With no commitment. Because my life is so unstable now and I can\u2019t commit to anybody but still I want that intimacy and feeling of being close emotionally and physically. When we are together I feel all that. He is open, he shares a lot about his life and feelings. But when we don\u2019t see each other - he is too cold for me.This lasts already for 5 months! (with 2 months break when we were long distance)What bothers me the most if he suddenly become warm again and giving me all that attention - i would be probably be distancing myself again. So basically we are just switching: first he is anxious and me is avoidant, then the opposite. AND IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY: my mind feels completely different things about the same person.I feel broken and that I am not able to maintain any kind of romantic or sexual relationship without suffering. :(I feel like it's better to end it, but then I think I will miss intimacy and I don't want to date anyone new again, the city I am is small and not a lot of interesting people here.\n\nI am here more for support, but would be happy to hear advise &lt;3 how you dealt with similar situations!",

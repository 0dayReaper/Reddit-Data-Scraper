    "postText": "This happened years back but it's always come back to haunt me and I don't think I would do any different if I was in the same position today, which sucks.\n\nWas eating at a food court in a mall with my parents when my dad started choking on a bone. I knew I was supposed to do the Heimlich maneuver but didnt do anything. I didn't want to draw attention. Ive tried running the scenario in my head time and time again as I've grown thinking I'd react differently but I have not.\n\nI would rather not risk causing a scene than losing my dad.\nI hate that that's what I'd do.",

            "comment": "If your dad was choking to the point where he needed the Heimlich maneuver, that itself could create a scene. If he didn't receive the Heimlich maneuver, he would pass out and need CPR...which would also cause a major scene. \n\nIf someone is staring at you with a look of terror in their eyes and practically silently begging you to help them so they don't die...do you really want to look away and ignore them while pretending to not notice?",

I vaguely remember realising that he was choking and not doing anything, I guess I was hoping it was nothing even though I knew that wasn't true.\n\n It was at a food court in a busy mall, obnoxiously loud coughing wasnt that uncommon, humping someone would've stood out, but yeah it did not get to a point where he was actually dying. I didn't ignore him or pretend not to notice, I watched him choke and did nothing about it. \n\nIf someone i did not know were dying in front of me in a public setting I don't think I would've helped, i would expect somebody who knows their shit to help. Pretty sure that's the bystander effect. I know it sounds bad but I'm certain im not the guy that would be helping.",

    "postText": "I (20f) absolutely despise my father. People say this a lot but I have never meant it more. Today is the day I lost every shred of love, hope and respect I might have still held onto for him. For context my biological dad dipped when I was two and Brad has been in my life since I was three. He \u201craised\u201c me and supported my mom and I ever since. He is the only father I know and honestly I never even thought about my bio dad until curiosity got to me at 18 and I contacted him. We spoke for a couple months in WhatsApp but as soon as I mentioned university and upcoming events he stopped talking to me ( I just want to say I pay for my own schooling with government help, as well as my own pocket money I did not even think about asking him for money which I assumed was what scarred him off). So as soon as we stopped talking I forgot ab him again. Brad doesn\u2018t know I ever spoke to him because a) It was never personal and i have every right to speak to bio dad and b) I loved brad too much to even utter bio dads name in front of him purely because I know how much of a slap in the face it would be for him. So this brings me to today. \n\nI am the oldest of four and im much older than my siblings. Today was my youngest brothers birthday and because of how rainy and gloomy the day was my mom and I wanted to make the day extra special for him once he got home from school. I got him ice cream cake, my mom absolutely decked out the house and got him a lot of gifts and i took him to see the new spiderman movie. He was so happy and overjoyed because in a family this big you\u2018re rarely the centre of attention. As we were singing happy birthday everyone was kind of doing their own thing and completely odd pitch which is okay its not meant to be a choir. My mom tried getting my dad to sing along but he got frustrated in the confusion and mid singing started yelling at everyone in anger that \u201chow is this his fault\u201c and \u201chow is he supposed to know this stuff\u201d. \n\nMind you this is just my siblings and my parents at the table so we all turned around at him confused at why he felt like he could just disrupt a 7 year old little boys moment with his immature tantrum. My mom quietly told him to either get his act together or leave the table if he was going to have a hissy firt about something so Stupid so he left. But not before making it a point to everyone that he thinks this whole thing is stupid and that me and my mom specificaly are stupid. This is not the first time he\u2019s singled me out when he\u2018s had a fight with my mom, he loves dragging my name through the dirt because I tent to stand up for my mom and myself. If he thinks he can run his mouth in inappropriate and disgusting manners and times then he has another thing coming. It is my baby brothers birthday the one day a year this innocent little boy gets to have it be all about him so you Better believe I gave him a piece of my mf mind. I always do. I have been having adult grown up fights with my dad since I was ten years old so I know how to stand my ground. Thanks for the life lesson dad. \n\nFighting and defending myself is probably the only thing he\u2019s ever taught me. This entire thing blew up now and he\u2019s absolutely trashing my mom. He likes to make sure she\u2018s reminded she would be nothing without him and it\u2019s HIS house and HE pays for it. Which is not true, my mom worked until my youngest sister was born and contributed to the mortgage and billls, and still does even though she\u2019s a stay at home mom now. I can\u2019t say the details but they needed up fighting on the porch and the things he said to her, the things he said to me were vile and disgusting. I have never been more convinced in my life that my dad hates me, but he\u2019s been like this ever since I have had a consciousness so what could that little innocent girl have done to him that could be so bad? I hate him so much. I would leave but Im not going anywhere until I know my siblings are grown up and happy and that my mom has a peaceful and tranquil life. So I will be here a while. For those of you thinking wow this escalated, no it didn\u2018t my dad is a ticking time bomb it takes very little to set him off, the one thing I can say is that at least he never got Physical. I mean when I was a kid he used the belt on me but he doesn\u2019t On my siblings. The most I can say is I wish that little girl in me had at least one good day with her dad that didisn\u2019t end with her in tears and that wasn\u2019t filled with anxiety. \n\nI just can\u2019t bear the thought of seeing those little faces drawn in disappointment on their birthdays because their dad can\u2018t keep his mouth shut for at least two minutes while we try to sing happy birthday. If you made it this far pls you\u2018re a trooper cause this is a lot. :)",

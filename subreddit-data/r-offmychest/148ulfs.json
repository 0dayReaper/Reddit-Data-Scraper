    "postText": "I've been with my current employer for 10 years. I worked my way up to be the manager of our main software system, and regularly take care of issues that nobody else can handle. I have been here through 5 different department heads. The most recent one was hired about 7 months ago. During that time, my wife was hospitalized several times due to multiple illnesses so I missed some time taking care of her. Apparently the new boss decided that meant I am a terrible employee and has been working to force me out for some time now. They told me I wasn't doing my job, they discounted my value at every opportunity, they told me to improve, I did, and then they told me that the improvements mean nothing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was told about 6 weeks ago that they were going to search for my replacement, have me train them, then let me go. At that point, I increased my focus on finding a new job. I spent weeks terrified that I would lose my family's only income source, we'd lose our house, etc. until last week. I got offered a job at a local facility, very similar to my current job, just different software. It comes with a significant pay increase, and much needed peace of mind. I then got a call today from another company saying they'd match the offer. I now have two options, both better situations than my current job. I just sent my resignation letter to HR and the COO. I am so relieved. I am excited to be somewhere that I'm actually valued. From what I understand, the search for my replacement has barely started. I'm leaving the others in my department in a bit of a bind since nobody else has my level of experience with the software used here. I do feel bad about that, but honestly I had to find something before I got let go. I've explained to them that this isn't how I wanted to leave, and my hand was forced. I'll set them up as best as I can before I leave, but honestly I'm mostly glad that I'm able to leave before I get kicked out. I hope they realize that they put their eggs in the basket of someone who knows nothing about the operation of the department instead of standing behind a loyal employee of a decade. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn to better things. Don't let negative forces make you believe you have no value.",

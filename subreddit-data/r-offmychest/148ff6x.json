    "postText": "Keeping this vague for anonymity purposes. I have had a friend for nearly a decade now, and over the years my opinion on them has soured.\n\nThey attempt to control me, always force me into things, and recently have begun to be more touchy with me. \n\nThey made comments about my body, have made incest related comments in relation to me and my siblings (most notably me and my 7 year old sister). It\u2019s only gotten worse over the years. But it especially got worse last week Thursday. \n\nI had a horrible headache, and they were staying over that day due to the fear of being home alone (to my dismay, call me an a*hole, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood for them at the time). As soon as  I walked in, I dropped on my couch, and they sat not too far from me, as I was dozing off though, they suddenly came onto me and slept with me. \n\nI was uncomfortable with this and kept moving my hand away, to which they\u2019d put it back. And I told them to move multiple times! Especially when they said they were feeling uncomfortable but didn\u2019t listen. \n\nI tried to get them off multiple times but just gave up, which resulted in my mom having to move them.\n\nI felt this was a clear disrespect of my boundaries, they talk about me not breaking their trust, and that I should care and listen to them more, but it feels (and especially after this incident) that they clearly wouldn\u2019t do the same for me.\n\nEven prior to this, I have told them multiple times to get their hands off me, and they never listened, I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. And my family clearly doesn\u2019t care and wont help me.\n\nI\u2019m trying to get this person out of my life ASAP.\n\nThanks for listening to me, Reddit.",

    "postText": "I had asked my friends to share my Substack profile where I used to write up stuff. They applaud my writings but they\u2019ve never but no one even bothered to share or subscribe to it. However, when my other friends ask them, they promote it heavily. \n\nNow I\u2019m in need of cash to pay for my house rent so I recently started a business on Fiverr where I design digital greeting cards for every occasion. I have been so stressed the last few weeks, trying to make a sale but in vain and also worrying if my landlord would kick me out soon. I tried asking my friends to promote it as well but no one ever helped out. Now I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something wrong with the content that I\u2019m posting. At least, if there was something wrong, I wouldn\u2019t have minded constructive criticism either.\n\nI\u2019m going through multiple flights of overthinking, self doubt &amp; sabotaging my mental health.",

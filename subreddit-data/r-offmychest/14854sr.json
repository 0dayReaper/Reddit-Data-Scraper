    "postText": "I wondered if I\u2019d ever hear from you because the breakup was so sudden and unexpected. I\u2019ve had a long of time to think about what may have went wrong and I realized we broke up,  in large part, because I was the only person identifying and expressing my needs. I think you wanted someone very similar to you to avoid having to speak up about differences and as a way to avoid conflict\n\nI remember how hard it seemed to be for you in February when you shared you were having doubts but I wanted to be a safe place for you to share. During that final conversation, it seemed like you had fallen into the rabbit hole and were catastrophizing about us\n\nI cared about you so much and was down to grow with you and fully realize us. There was no guarantee we would work out but I believed in us and thought we were both ready to put in the work that relationships require out of that initial honeymoon phase. I want someone on my team who is looking for a partner with different strengths and weaknesses, who trusts me and also believes in interdependence. Claiming to have no needs will always backfire because then you are just the person doling out energy to the other person with no return, unless that person is obsessively trying to meet your unexpressed needs. And despite the way we were raised, having needs makes us human\n\nI don\u2019t need some huge self reflection back and honestly, it\u2019s not really your responsibility to give me that nor my business any more. But I just wanted to share my thoughts that have built up over the past few months. And I really wish you well despite how sad and abruptly things ended with us. I know you have a big and good heart and I\u2019ve never doubted that",

            "comment": "I'd love to hear something like this from my ex. And then I would say yeah shit fell apart. And it's easy to to think to ourselves that either one of us is in the right or the healthier one. I would also say it's unfortunate that the things that happened and have as much an effect on them as it did on me. But then I would say to them in order to define the truth of the matters where shit went down where things Fall apart...\n\nOne would have to cite examples. Not broad spectrum broad brushed over sights and undertones of cliche terms of what's mentally sound and what is it.\n\nI would say it really hits the pride to know that it doesn't affect them that much but I do know that it doesn't even though you aren't them very similar it doesn't affect them like that.\n\nBut I would definitely say if you ever wondered the trth the actual truth. And you weren't able to get away with taking your broad brush and swiping it over everything to kind of glaze it with overstanding.\n\nWe could lay out specifics, in a timeline, specific words specific events specific things that were said or done.\n\nAnd we could judge from there.\n\nI know that'll never happen because it doesn't really affect them but gosh it would be great. I would look forward to since it was so short lived this last time we tried to even communicate healthily. Would absolutely look forward to laying out a list of specifics instead of broad brushing everything.\n\nBut that's never going to happen it's just a dream that fantasize about. Because truly the devil is in the details\n\nCovert manipulation passive aggression and plausible deniability can wreak havoc on someone that doesn't have the best track record but it's absolutely trying their best and walking the right direction... Can wreak havoc when it's put up on them. But specifics would expose it. And that's why I will never get specifics",

    "postText": "I'm m22 just going to rant about my mom and me. We don't have the best relationship, and we barely talk to each other. The only time she talks to me is when she wants me to do something or take care of my older autistic brother, whom we'll call Jack. My mom and I have been arguing all week because she wants me to be Jack's caregiver in case something happens to her. I told her no because I don't think I'm cut out for that role. I suggested getting someone professional or a program to help instead.\n\nHowever, in my head, I've been thinking that I've been taking care of people my whole life, and now I want to start my own family and get married. The other day, someone asked me why I don't have a girlfriend, and I told them that I'm still immature and working on myself for a relationship, so no, I'm not talking to anyone. Also, I want to figure out my life right now. I'm in college, a junior majoring in computer science. To put it nicely, I lack communication skills and get shy a lot, so I've been pushing myself to go out more. This week, I even started salsa dance classes to help me. Also looking for an internship.\n\nAdditionally, I have a part-time job helping my blind aunt, taking her to doctors' appointments. She needs a new kidney. I also have a full-time job working the third shift, which my mom doesn't know about, along with helping my aunt. But back to the story, I love Spiderman. I ordered my tickets a while ago because I don't get a lot of free time and don't have much money. So, I saw Spiderman late at night for the second time. My mom called me selfish and started crying because I didn't take Jack. And how I\u2019m treating him wrong \n\nShe also told me she's going to take me off the car insurance, something I've been asking her to do, and put the car in my name, but I know she won't. My mom doesn't spend much time with Jack, except when she makes him go grocery shopping. She insists that no woman should carry heavy stuff like water or groceries when she has two males in the house. It's strange because she feels it's a bad thing to hang out with her son. She wants me to take her to see The Little Mermaid, which is weird because she never asks to hang out.\n\nAnother thing is that my mom wants to take us on a cruise. I don't have to pay anything, but I have to watch my brother. It seems like a nightmare because my brother is girl-crazy and might touch a girl if not watched closely. He got fired from his last job because of that. So, I told my mom that I'm good, and she and my brother can go while I take care of the dog. She got mad at me for saying no. I'm sorry if it's selfish, but I'm not Jack's parent, so I'm not thinking the same way my mom is. She had Jack when she was 18, and I'm 22 now, just starting to go out. Jack doesn't have anyone else, and I know his life is hard, but I don't want to be his caregiver for the rest of my life.\n\nLiving with my brother is not easy. He has a food addiction, so I'm not allowed to bring a lot of food into the house also he got this p*rn addiction where he got to watch in the living room . And when he gets mad at Mom, he starts breaking stuff. But I feel like he can control his anger because he doesn't do that to me. In the future, I do want to get married and have my own kids, if possible. I've been trying to start my own holiday traditions, but my mom gets mad when I try anything without him . I want to start my own life. Just like any other 22 year old\n\nmy mom doesn't see that. All she sees is my brother and me. It feels like my life revolves solely around my brother. I'm planning to sign up for therapy after this I have a lot of things to work on . I\u2019m screwed. I'm not going to let my brother be homeless, by the way. I feel like people don't understand how hard it is to live with an autistic person .\n\nMy rant is over thank you for reading this . Have an great day .",

You have a right to say no and live your life regardless of how your mom or anyone else feels about the situation. I carried a lot of guilt for a long time because my parents accused me of abandoning a child who isn't even mine. Spend time making your own decisions and living your life your way because nobody is going to thank you or appreciate you sacrificing your youth to your brother. Eventually, you're just going to end up resenting him if you let your family take over your life so go out and live your life guilt free.",

I should use \"want\" instead of \"force\".\n\nI actually had (now deceased) aunt she was mentally like 3 y.o. for her whole life. My grandma (very kind woman) had her and 3 other daughters. She herself took care about this aunt till aunt's 21 y.o. then she was placed in a place for such disabled people. Every holiday (Christmas, summer holiday - 2 months in my country) the aunt was brought into my grandma's house for whole holidays.\n\nMy grandma never say a word to her other 3 daughters that they should take care about their mentally disabled sister. She knew it isn't their fault that their oldest sister is so severely disabled (it wasn't even her fault either. The aunt was born as a healthy child but she caught a disease in a maternity hospital and doctors those days cured this disease by putting a syringe into a newborn's skull. This treatment made my aunt mentally disabled. Sadly it happened to more children in those times) and she wouldn't have expectations about taking care of their disabled sister of them ever. She knew she is a parent and it is her duty to take care about her children (along with my grandpa).\n\nAgain it is no responsibility of OP. He didn't create his brother. It isn't his fault that he was born to his mother. His mother and father (if he is alive) are only responsible people for his older brother.\n\nEdit. I am not saying it is an easy situation. But again she has no right to want OP to take care about his brother. It is only her and a father's of an autistic brother responsibility. I also know how it is with wards. My aunt was earlier in a place where christian nuns took care about mentally disabled people. She loved it there. Nuns were great.\n\nThen as she got older she couldn't be in a nun's place as their took care only about people up to certain age. She was placed in a place where were old people and mentally disabled people together. From start she was bullied by senior women who also stole her food sometimes. My grandma wondered why the aunt is so possessive of a food and then find out (my aunt was able of an easy communication). Grandma made complaints to the staff and they relocated my aunt. Also my aunt taught herself how to defend herself to these old women.\n\nMy grandma also visited my aunt at a ward a few times in a year (if the aunt wasn't by her place).",

She was 55 y.o. when she died. She died of pulmonary embolism. She complained about pain in her thigh for days before. She was by a doctor but he didn't examined her properly. She had a trombosis in her thigh and unfortunatelly because it was left untreated the trombosis then went into her lungs which caused her death.\n\nI am from Czech republic (middle Europe). I have to correct myself as my mother told me the aunt lived with my grandma fulltime only up to her 3 y.o. (the time grandma's second daughter was born) then she was in the nun's place (where she really loved it. Nuns were great. They went out of their way for these disabled children.)\n\nThen in her twenties she was placed in home where disabled people were mixed with seniors. My mother also corrected me that the aunt was by grandma's place from Christmas till a day or two after 8th. January (her birthday). She also came to grandma's place on Easter holidays. It was this way till the death of my aunt. My grandma was 77 y.o. in the time of my aunt's death.\n\nEdit. if you were interested the disease the aunt caught in a maternity hospital was jaundice. Childern who caught it were very sleepy. They were sleeping so much. Doctors didn't know better and sadly treated them by putting a syringe into their skulls.",

I ended up buying a phone and plan the next day and within a few weeks buying my own car. She later had a conversation with my friend saying she \u2018Couldn\u2019t believe I went out and bought a car without even talking it over with her,\u2019 like it was a bad thing. I think she realized what she was doing and that \u201cleverage\u201d and \u201cblackmail\u201d wasn\u2019t working to control me and keep me from becoming and independent person. I learned that every offer was something she would hang over my head, so i\u2019m glad you turned down that cruise trip.\n\nI also work as a part-time caregiver, I know the behavioral struggles that individuals who have autism can have. There are plenty of programs nationwide that your mother could have access to if she did any research. Free programs. These programs not only help families, but they help individuals who have autism in forming goals and achieving goals, working on behaviors, being involved in the community, etc..\n\nBeing a parent means doing the best you can for your child. You are not the best she can do for him. You have your own life to balance, it can\u2019t be balanced trying and stressing to give him what you can\u2019t.",

I didn\u2019t have her to be a potential future caregiver. I want all three of my kids to live the best life possible for them. Your mom acts as if you were a free cater for your brother already and that\u2019s not okay at all. If she wants both her sons to join her on a vacation she should also want both of you to enjoy the trip. It\u2019s not your job to watch your brother, it\u2019s not your responsibility now or in the future to take care of him.",

A lot of the same stuff, getting addicted to things and becoming angry and violent when he\u2019s mad. When I was living at home before moving out for college, i felt the same way about needing to work around his sensibilities and that a lot of life revolved around him; i\u2019m lucky that my mom did not relegate his care to me, and she\u2019s actually his primary caregiver and he lives with her. I\u2019m sorry your mom does not prioritize your wellness as much as your brothers as mine does for me. All I can say is, cases like this is hard because a lot of the time government assistance takes a while to come through, and group housing tends to kick out residents when theres a violent incident, so its usually always family that needs to care for the individual. it should be no one\u2019s fault though, let alone a kid like yourself. It sounds like your mom isnt giving you the space you deserve right now, and its hard to, but try to ignore her at this part of your life and focus on yourself and your career. This will be better for everyone involved in the future; remind her that you need to focus on you, so that you will be better equipped to financially support part of your brothers livelihood, especially as your mom gets older and can\u2019t do so anymore. Im sorry youre going through it; good luck",

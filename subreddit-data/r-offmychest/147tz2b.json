    "postText": "This is going to be a very long post so i appreciate anyone who chooses to read. I'm honestly not sure how to start this post so I will dive right in. I am 20f and I went into TC at the age of fourteen. After experiencing assault from a close friend of mine I had been experimenting with drugs, sex, bad relationships, and overall shitty teenage rebellion that got out of hand. I found out my parents were planning on sending me to this place in Oklahoma for god knows how long. I ran away and was sleeping on the floors of Walmarts and Mcdonalds booths for a little over one to two weeks, I honestly can't remember how long I was gone. But in between avoiding creepy men trying to pick me up and coming down off of drugs I was terrified. My parents found me eventually and took me home where they would drive me to TC a few days later.\n\nOnce I arrived I had an ankle monitor put on, I was strip searched, drug tested, and was told to say goodbye to my parents as I wouldnt be allowed to speak to them for two weeks per program rules. I was given a buddy, or a girl who had been there for a while to show me the ropes and all of the rules of the program (there were many). all new girls were put on something called Wordfast, which will come up a lot. Basically you can't speak, at all, I was only allowed to talk to my buddy or staff for the first three days of my stay there. There were girls from 14-18 but most signed themselves out at 18.\n\nThere are so many rules and aspects of this program that I can't even begin to dive into so i will write the most memorable aspects for me, the things that stick to me to this day.There are many rules in the program, and minor rules got extensive punishments from physical exercise to writing sentences or being put on Wordfast, but the worst punishment of them all was something known as D-level. If you punch a staff member, threaten someone, run away, etc you're put on D level. This included being forced to wear flats or our church shoes, kakis, and a oversized blue shirt at all times. you weren't allowed to sit on any furniture, speak to any new girls, read anything but the bible, you had no social time (could only play solitaire) and had a awful diet of unflavored oatmeal for breakfast, tuna and bread w veg for lunch, and canned ravioli w veg for dinner. if we got a special treat like sonic you had to sit and watch everyone eat while you got done, most of the time this would last for a month but I saw it go up to three months once.\n\nIf a girl turned 18 and decided they didnt want to be there anymore then you could leave, but you got none of your stuff, nothing but the clothes on your back. This and no phone call, no ride into town, you simply walk out the door into the woods in an area filled with predators, both animal and human. I was told a story of a girl who signed her self and out was kidnapped, then found a few days later. I watched a few girls walk out the door, others would wait until theyre families visited then signed themselves out. one staff member almost got fired because he gave a boy a ride into the nearest town to catch a bus or call his family.\n\nStaff sleeping with students was a reoccurring problem. most staff were 20s-50s while all the students were minors or just turned 18. Almost every time that comes to memory it was swept under the rug with the staff immediately leaving and not being allowed to say goodbye. But the one they couldn't hide was what our Lead Director and Pastor did. I can only say what I have heard but he was fired immediately for sleeping with a female student for a prolonged period of time. we all knew and we also knew we could not speak a word about it or else we'd face severe punishment.\n\nThis is a widely Christian organization, conversion was advertised as not being a \"necessity\" but everyone knew it was impossible to complete the program without it. if you weren't worshiping, or praying you weren't \"growing\" therefore you could not progress. I can remember being told I was broken every single day in church service, seeing people speak in tongues, collapse in the middle of service, all while never having a Christian upbringing. Emotional manipulation during these church services were commonplace. We would spend an hour listening to how we were nothing and broken without Jesus and then forced to sit with it while emotional music played in the background and staff walked around praying for us. harmful christian messages such as homophobia, sexism, and etc was a normal occurrence. We could only listen to christian music, read Christian books, watch Christian movies, ended everyday with devotionals, church 2-3 times a week and bible study daily. it was everywhere, always.\n\nI was in the middle of a court case and was only allowed to speak to my victim advocate one time and the entire phone call was monitored by the lead pastors wife, I felt unable to ask questions and even know how it was going. I never found out the verdict until three years later when I called my victims advocate.\n\nThe worst experience for me was when I reached the one year anniversary of my assault, this may be triggering so i apologize for it in advance. i struggled with self harm for a very long time, and I wont go into details but I relapsed during that time and hurt myself on my legs. I grew tired of hiding it and feeling the burning in every shower and not being able to wear shorts in gym, so I walked into the office and told the staff member what I did, showing her my legs. Her only reaction was \"I should really give you a discipline for this, but I wont\" Disciplines where the punishment (most of the time sentences) for breaking rules. that was her reaction to my self harm, to me reaching out for help. I will never forget her saying that.These are just some of my experiences that i witnessed first hand from this program. It has hurt me and so many people I know but everyone I talk to about it mostly just wants to move on. yet I find myself feelings like I cant let go, fourteen year old me didn't deserve that. I can't let go of the memories even though it feels like a lifetime ago. I'm in college now with a wonderful partner who knows a small part of all of this. I've been diagnosed with PTSD from this place and struggle with nightmares to this day. I don't know how to let go of that part of my life, or of the anger I feel.\n\nIf you made it this far thank you for reading, today is the fifth year anniversary of me leaving and I've only really shared all of this with my therapist and needed somewhere to just put it all.",

I remember my bio parents praising the teen challenge organization. I always just thought it was a spiritual based rehab for addiction. But I had a feeling there was more to it. I don\u2019t doubt anything you\u2019ve said. I believe they still have that program in my city and now I want to advocate against it. I hope you find a path forward with healing and happiness.",

Please do advocate against it because this place is so harmful to teens who need love, therapy, and compassion. Not discipline, Christianity, and silence",

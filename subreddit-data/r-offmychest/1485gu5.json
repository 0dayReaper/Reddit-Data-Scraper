    "postText": "I (15f) got raped by my friends (14f) dad when I was around the age of 10. I told authorities when I was 13. Everyone around me made me feel like shit for it. My own fucking parents supported my rapist behind my back and got a lawyer for him. My brother made jokes about it. It has ruined my life in so many ways. I can\u2019t even fucking lay my head down in class anymore because the feeling of my legs in open air scares me so much. I\u2019m ruined mentally and physically. I have been going to therapy and have been on meds for about a year but I hate to say it hasn\u2019t worked that well because I tried to kill my self. Last year I found out that my rapist got out of jail after only a year in prison. A year. While I have to deal with this trauma for the rest of my life. \nI hope this is enough context for what I\u2019m going to say. My friend (14f) said to me \u201cMaybe [my name] did do the right thing when she called the police \ud83d\udc80, I sometimes feel like it but then again maybe not\u201d while I was having a conversation with my friends about how bad it messed me up. \nThat hurt so bad to read I felt all of the fear and heartbreak that I experienced two years ago rushing back to me. \nHonestly it\u2019s been hurting me so much but I don\u2019t know who to tell about this because she\u2019s one of my favorite friends and I don\u2019t wanna lose her but at the same time I do have self respect. But yea I just wanted to get that off my chest.",

I'm so sorry this happened to you, and I know rn it's beyond difficult to deal w/.\n\n I was raped by my best friend's uncle when I was 14 and experienced similar treatment, compounded by the hate I got when I found out I was pregnant from the assault and had an abortion. It took me years to move past it, and I'm 36 now. My attacker served 5 years and moved away, and even though he wasn't in the state anymore, I was still afraid. But I did find a way to cope.\n\nThe best revenge is not only surviving, but *thriving*. They want to take your feelings of control over yourself away, to destroy you, and one day I decided that I had had enough of feeling powerless and afraid. I actively made an effort to learn self defense, I poured myself into my school work, went to college, graduated, and have a wonderful and supporting bf. \n\nOne day about 5 years ago, we were out shopping and I saw my attacker, and instead of fear and anxiety, I felt triumph. He couldn't do anything to me anymore, and I felt liberated. We made eye contact and I flipped him off while saying to my bf, 'Babe look! It's the guy who raped me when I was 14!' loud af; everyone around us turned and looked at him w/disgusted faces, and he abandoned his cart and walked out of the store. It was one of the best moments in my life, bc I knew that I had won. And it was just so....fucking delicious. \n\nStay strong OP; you are not alone, no matter what you think. You're still here, and every day that you are is a testament to how strong really you are, even if you don't feel that way now.",

Sometimes how we frame things can change our whole outlook, and every time I started to get angry about what happened, I'd focus the anger on my training or school work. I used it as a catalyst to improve myself, and not let my attacker win. \n\nBut that's a two-sided coin; *use* your anger, but don't let it control and consume you. Revenge is a dish best served cold, but don't serve it to yourself. \n\nIf you ever want to talk, my dms are always open.\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

No one in their right mind would support a rapist especially someone who did something so horrible to a minor! You will take a while to really start feeling better in therapy, but don't give up! I would recommend talking to your psychiatrist about changing your medications for something more effective for you because everybody is different. Also, don't forget that sometimes you might need a different psychologist to talk to and that's ok to ask for someone else. Group therapy and joining support groups for other victims that have gone what you went through would be something to consider as well. So stay strong and don't give up you can make it through this and come out stronger with better people in your life than those you have right now!",

I know school is probably not on your list of important things right now. However in the long run having a decent education will help you escape what is continuing to harm you. I'm sorry you don't have to support you deserve at home. Just keep on trying to survive. When it comes time to leave plan accordingly and don't look back.

It\u2019s so horrible to be a child and also a rape survivor. Nobody understands who hasn\u2019t been through it. Please make it to adulthood. I promise it gets better. I never thought it would and tried to kill myself so many times when I was your age going though the same thing. I never thought I would make it to my 20s but I\u2019m so happy now. I know the same will happen for you.",

I had several friends i considered close, maybe it just depends who you asked.... we worked together for almost a decade, hung out outside of work, celebrated each others milestones and victories, texted throughout the  day.... now I don't even get a birthday text.\n\nJust feeling kind of butthurt thinking that a job was the only thing we ever had solidifying our friendship \u2639",

I just hung out with friends I had ent seen in almost a year and who I thought we were good friends, walked right by me and just said \u201chey man\u201d like a stranger. I was butt hurt as well and then thought well fuck it. I\u2019ll be nice and try again and not much was said. So I guess we aren\u2019t as close anymore.",

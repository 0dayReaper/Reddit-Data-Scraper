    "postText": "How many of these post get made a day I wonder. Welp todays my birthday. I\u2019m 25. I hate my birthdays. It\u2019s one of the worst days of the year. When I was younger my family just used it as a tool to make me feel bad about myself and remind me that I\u2019m an accident and that I owe all this crap and bs. They\u2019ve since gotten better after I was adopted at 17. But it still hangs so heavy in the back of my mind. My adopted family and my husband especially make it a lot easier. It\u2019s a good day to smoke a lot and sleep the day away.",

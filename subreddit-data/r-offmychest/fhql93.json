    "postText": "My biggest source of stress is people who come in wanting to buy a pill/supplement that they can slip to their partner/spouse without them knowing. I get asked on an almost daily basis to help some person essentially drug someone that trusts them so they can get a nut. I\u2019m horrified and every time it happens I sort of shut down because I\u2019m afraid of saying the wrong thing and losing my job. I\u2019ll usually say something like \u201cwell our pills can\u2019t be crushed up or dissolved, so I suggest having a conversation with your partner about trying one and allowing them to have informed consent\u201d and they look at me all horrified like \u201cI\u2019m not trying to rape them\u201d.... but they kind of are. Giving someone something to make them horny when they wouldn\u2019t take it if given the choice is such a violation of consent and trust. I would be destroyed if my partner did that to me. How can anyone ever think this is okay?",

I have a vague memory of saying \u201cstop babe\u201d but that\u2019s it. Idk what I said stop to or about. Just naked him on top of me. The next morning I had a splitting headache when I woke up totally naked. I felt so much shame. He just had such a proud smile on his face. \n\nTo this day (this happened 15 years ago) I know he still thinks he did nothing wrong. He has never admitted to drugging me, but I know he did. I know because I never even got through my first beer that night. Drank maybe half a beer but he swears he thought I was \u201cjust tipsy\u201d. \n\nPeople, please don\u2019t ever do this to you SO. Please. It\u2019s a violation. Talk about it first. If you want to feel high when having sexual cool. But be sober when you have the talk. Please. Respect each other.",

When I was up for it with my ex I was a once and done kinda guy, sometimes twice but only a couple of times in the 12 years we were together. \nFirst time I tried the little blue pill OH MY FREAKING GOD! I had to tap out after 2 hours and 5 nuts and was completely exhausted even though the little guy was still ready for battle, but best sex of my life! If he has no trouble I kind of just laid myself bare in that comment and feel a bit stupid but hey maybe someone needs to see it, guys, you\u2019re under no obligation to fuck on command and a low sex drive is fine, the trick is to find someone with a similar drive as you and be prepared to compromise, sex is great but it\u2019s not the be all and end all.",

There are days when I\u2019m gagging for it and get frustrated but again I\u2019d never go for a random hook up and my current relationship is still not at the physical stage as we\u2019ve decided to take our time. My previous relationship was 12 years and my sexual desire for her never changed in that time, even early on we were only having it max twice a week because I didn\u2019t want to. I\u2019m struggling to explain it I think but hope that makes a bit of sense?\n\nAlso in the context of my previous comment, I\u2019m hinting towards the question of if his drive is low due to ED or Performance anxiety in which case little blue pills FTW!

What if one of those pills are given and the person takes a certain blood thinner and heart medication or anything like that? It could possibly increase blood pressure and that could be so dangerous. or what if someone was on a medicine that their partner wasn't aware of? Those pills are not evaluated by the FDA and besides the idea of it being wrong, they need to consider other aspects of safety too. You would be surprised how many people are, then aren't, on at least one type of medicine regularly.",

It fucked me up for years and I\u2019m still in therapy. \n\nI hate that you have to dance around to keep your job.

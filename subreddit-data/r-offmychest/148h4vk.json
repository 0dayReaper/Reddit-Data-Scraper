    "postText": "It kinda hurts my feelings or ego seeing someone who only felt superficial feelings for you feel genuine feelings for another person treating them right, giving them real love and respect-- something you know that person would never do to you\n\nIdk if I caught feelings for the person or I just didn't fully accept the fact that everything would be unreal, unserious, or just a joke. I realized that being in this type of situation/relationship makes me feel empty, used, and worthless, especially afterwards. Tho yes at some point it was fun, i feel like it's just so temporary. Maybe I also just felt pressure from some of my peers because they seemed to enjoy such, that I'm young and this age wont last, so maybe I should try such things too-- be dumb and just explore\n\nI know everyone wouldn't agree with me but maybe it's really not just for meee. (And I lowkey hate it, I feel like im so vulnerable at this point)\n\nI regret doing it, I guess?? What if he/they only perceive me as the girl whom no one will commit to and will just really be alone in the end?\n\nIdk if anyone would understand my post since my thoughts are messy rn, just wanted to vent bcs I couldnt explain the feeling to anyone",

            "comment": "Society has phases of social acceptability that are constantly changing. Don't let conformity force you into a box that doesn't fit you. In a few years, what's trendy now will change again and leave everyone who performed to fit in floundering for a sense of their own identities/values. If you don't want to date casually, you don't have to. It might be frustrating to wade through so many people who are following a social trend. But still hold onto your values. You'll find your niche eventually and when you do, you'll be happy you chose to live by your own standards rather than cave to social pressure. Especially after the social trend changes again. \n\nYou'll also have an easier time finding someone whose values complement your own.",

    "postText": "My life is at a point where it feels senseless and like no purpose besides chaos and just drama in my life. Being pulled on all sides feeling like I\u2019m gonna rip apart soon.. my family is always mixed up in some shit and everyone else in my life is super conflicted with their own problems or problems tying in to my life or my family. All the sides pulling on me hate each other and fight over me and my presence so to say. Everyone is toxic and I see it and hate to see it. I feel like if I left everything and started over everything would be better in the end. But theirs one thing keeping me in this city, It feel like it\u2019s home. But the people here are gonna ruin me\u2026 I\u2019m so stuck in my own head now I feel like that\u2019s the only option.",

    "postText": "When I was 21 years old I was a virgin who had never been kissed. I lost a lot of weight after high school and was feeling very confident, so I decided to ask out my old high school crush. Half of me was so ready to get these sexual experiences, and the other half really wanted him to like me, so I had sex with him despite not feeling like I was ready. Everything about it was terrible, especially the pain. I remember after he fell asleep, I ran a hot bath and sat in it and cried. I grabbed a mirror to look at my vagina to find it bleeding and torn. The following week was physically and mentally painful; my vagina constantly hurting, and he would barely speak to me half the time. The worst part is that I continued to sleep with him. Each time was unpleasant, and I heavily disassociated during it. I allowed it all to happen though, thinking that maybe as time goes by it would stop hurting and his feelings would grow for me. Of course, neither happened. He only cared about his own pleasure, and the messed up part is so did I. I didn\u2019t want to speak up because I didn\u2019t want to make HIM feel bad. After five months of stringing me along, he finally dumped me.I have only had sex with one other person since him, and while it wasn\u2019t painful, it wasn\u2019t very pleasurable either, and I still experienced the disassociation similar to previous experiences. After these two guys, I promised myself that I will never again have sex with someone without recognizing that my needs are just as important. I have no idea when this will happen though. Due to past partners not caring about my needs along with theirs, combined with whatever the hell is wrong in my head, I am completely turned off on the idea of having sex with or even dating someone new; it\u2019s been almost three years of celibacy. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m like this, I feel like I\u2019m sexually broken.",

            "comment": "I am so sorry to hear you had such a terrible sexual experience.You\u2019re not sexually broken though.It seems like you have sexual trauma and might need to go therapy.Also it\u2019s common to not experience pleasure during sex if you\u2019re not turned on and have anxiety. A lot of people like me can\u2019t do casual sex and need to have an emotional connection to enjoy it.There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Maybe try having masturbation and experimenting with your sexuality by yourself first",

Getting sexuality right on your first try would be lucky as hell. Almost nobody has a good first time(s).\n\nJust be sure to learn from it sweetheart, and don\u2019t give up on yourself even if some selfish losers did.\n\nRooting for you\u270a",

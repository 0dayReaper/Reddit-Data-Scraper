    "postText": "So my best friend (23F) is in an emotionally abusive relationship with her fiance (28M). We've got screenshots and videos of tons of interactions between both of them. Even a recorded death threat. It's been a slow road to realization because he's so sweet up until he can't have his way. Then he lashes out or turns things around on her. She has feared for her life and has lost a lot of weight.\n\nUnfortunately he lives with her parents. And my friends mom absolutely adores him and calls him her son and everything. So we were wary of bringing it to them to begin with. \n\nShe was adamant it was mental illness and the dad was going on about how if it was true love she would stick by him and get him help. It just felt super deflating but we stuck to our guns about how he needed to be removed for my friends safety.\n\nThey came to a conclusion that they would get residential set up and bring it up to him at the right time. He's known to threaten suicide and stuff so we wanted to take it slowly. But the idea was that they could get him help and also out of the house.\n\nThat didn't end up happening. My friend came clean to him because she couldn't keep up the facade any longer and her heart was breaking thinking about leaving him. The mom was the only witness to them talking this out. \n\nHe claims that he was completely unaware about how his actions were perceived and feels terrible for making her feel like that. And they decided to go ahead and try to get him therapy instead of residential.\n\nThat is until yesterday when they went out to do something. He just outright lies to her about knowing it was me who hated him and wanting me out of the house. So ofc my friend tried to calm him down and say it wasn't like that. But in turn let him know what we had tried to do.\n\nTo add to this the mom is so convinced that she won't abandon him. That I even asked if push came to shove that he would leave if my friend didn't feel safe. And she just danced around the question.",

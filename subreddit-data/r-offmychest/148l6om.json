    "postText": "When I was 17 I got raped by a guy I was dating at the time. He said it was OK because we were dating but I told him it wasn't OK because I said no. It was really violent and it left me bruised and torn. \n\nI ended up calling someone who was supposedly my good friend and told him what had happened and he said he'd come over and talk to me. \n\nWhen he came over he started cracking jokes and trying to cheer me up but I was pretty inconsolable. When he was hugging me I got a bad feeling. Then he pulled away, put his hand over my mouth, pushing me down on the floor and said, if you tell anyone they won't believe you. Before raping me too. \n\nI've never felt so much shame.",

Reach out for support: Connect with a trusted friend, family member, or a helpline specifically dedicated to supporting survivors of sexual assault. They can provide a listening ear, emotional support, and help you navigate available resources.\n\n2. Seek professional help: Consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma and sexual assault. They can provide guidance, coping strategies, and a safe space to process your emotions.\n\n3. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote self-care and well-being. This might include exercise, meditation, spending time in nature, or engaging in hobbies that bring you joy and relaxation.\n\n4. Create a safety plan: If you feel unsafe or anxious, develop a safety plan that includes strategies to ensure your physical and emotional well-being. This may involve changing routines, securing your living environment, or exploring options such as restraining orders or protective measures.\n\n5. Educate yourself: Learn about the healing process after trauma and familiarize yourself with resources available in your community. Knowledge can empower you and help you make informed decisions about your healing journey.\n\n6. Consider joining support groups: Connecting with other survivors through support groups or online communities can offer a sense of belonging, understanding, and shared experiences. It can be comforting to know that you're not alone.\n\nRemember, everyone's healing process is unique, and it's essential to prioritize your own well-being. Take your time, be patient with yourself, and seek professional guidance when needed.",

What the other person hears is that you\u2019re an easy target. He now knows that if the other guy got away with it, so can he. It\u2019s how my uncle gained the confidence to assault me. A few weeks before, I confided in him that a coworker was touching me inappropriately and I was too scared to speak up. Ding ding ding. Music to his ears. It\u2019s not our fault, we shouldn\u2019t have to learn this lesson. There\u2019s no way to predict it either. No one teaches girls this stuff.",

It\u2019s those horrible disgusting beings who should be ashamed. Not you. You need to keep your head high and move on. \n\nAnd I\u2019m saying this as someone who got repeatedly raped at 16-17 by the person I was dating. For the longest time I didn\u2019t have the courage to leave that relationship, I blamed myself, felt disgusted by myself. It\u2019s been almost ten years and I still feel scared to think about how lonely and helpless I felt. it took me some time to understand that it wasn\u2019t my fault, that no matter what happened or how scared I was at that time, I wasn\u2019t to be blamed. That I deserve love and kindness form myself at the very least. \n\nMy heart goes out to you. Please never blame yourself. You\u2019re an amazing and strong human being. Live your life the way you want. Live your life to the fullest! The horrid things happened to you but that is in the past. Never even look back, if possible. A big hug to you if you are a hugger.",

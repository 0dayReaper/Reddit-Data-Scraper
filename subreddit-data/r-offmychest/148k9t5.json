    "postText": "To sum it up, my dad has had a genetic heart condition since he was 30. My wife (f 27) and I (f 29) haven\u2019t been supported as a lesbian couple by my parents, my dad has never been outright mean to her but has never been friendly or really gotten to know her over the five years we\u2019ve been together. \n\nThis past week we found out he\u2019s in severe heart failure and his time is looking pretty limited. Since coming out six years ago him and I have had a really rocky relationship and his attitude towards me has been pretty shitty, but now that he\u2019s getting really sick he\u2019s been nicer and trying to reach out more. He and I used to be extremely close, he was my best friend in the world, but my wife never saw that guy. \n\nMy wife is annoyed that I\u2019m willing to take him to dr apts here and there, nothing crazy just one in the last few months, saying I\u2019m dropping everything for someone who treats us like shit, but reality is I\u2019m just trying to soak up a little time with my dad while he\u2019s acting like he used to. She told me last night my family will be better off when he\u2019s dead because of how shitty he\u2019s treated a lot of us (just super judgmental and arrogant and rude, typical racist homophobe white guy). I just want the last little bit of time with him to be something that isn\u2019t painful to think back on. \n\nI can kind of understand her point, but part of me thinks it\u2019s just jealousy because she doesn\u2019t have a relationship with her dad at all by his own choice. \n\nShe is willing to come with me and sit in the waiting room during his apts so I\u2019m not alone, but made it abundantly clear that it\u2019s solely for me and not for him. She said she\u2019ll never care about him or have any pity on him because of how cruel he\u2019s been to us (more behind the back whisper type shit) but that she will support whatever I need during this time. \n\nI guess I\u2019m looking for some kind of perspective. I\u2019m feeling isolated and lonely like she just should show some compassion and not be an asshole, but then I remember the things he\u2019s done the last few years and I cringe and I understand her point. \n\nI need someone to give me a little idea of how to handle this. Life sucks and I feel like I\u2019m betraying the great guy my dad was when I was a kid now that he\u2019s back to acting like a sweet guy, but like I\u2019m betraying my wife by being around him because of how disrespectful and shut off he\u2019s been towards her specifically. \n\nHelp..",

No blood ties are more important than him not being there for me when I needed him the most. \n\nI\u2019m still being the bigger person, I\u2019m being the good daughter, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m soaking up time with some fantasy of a person who doesn\u2019t exist. I\u2019m doing it because it\u2019s the right thing to do, and not because I think he deserves anything. \n\nThe fact she\u2019s willing to come and wait with you should be enough. \n\nYou want this woman to have empathy for someone who was never once kind to her. What well is she pulling that from?",

            "comment": "You're romanticizing your dad, let's be honest. He's not back to how he used to be, he just realized he needs to suck it up and deal with his feelings about you being gay because he's only got a limited time left on this earth, and it took him almost dying to realize you were important to him and that he needed you, he couldn't even bother to reach that conclusion himself. \n\nYour wife has never met the person you thought he was, and the person he was when he was nice to you as a kid was based on who he thought you were, not who you are. Of course she has zero sympathy for the man who made both of your lives significantly harder and hurt you, the most important person in the world to her. Where is her sympathy supposed to come from? \n\nThat being said, shit talking a dying man to his daughter managing his care and making her support some sort of giant inconvenience to her (which she is, when she's saying \"I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you\") isn't okay. Have a frank conversation with her, let her know you appreciate the support, but right now is not the time that you need to be ingesting her opinions about your dad when he's about to die. There's a time and a place for those discussions, but you choosing to support your family has to be a main priority for you right now, and support that comes with a price of dealing with her negative comments makes it harder to complete what you're trying to do here, whether she understands it or not. You need her to be emotionally present and not another stressor to manage. \n\nLater, I'd also recommend working on your communication and maturity within the relationship. I hate my husband's mom, she's a terrible person who left lasting damage on my husband, but I would never dream of saying that to his face because he loves her despite all that. I just provide gentle support when she's being out of pocket to him and have strict guidelines boundaries for her visits. She's hurting you by not managing her feelings and making them your problem to deal with during an already stressful time.",

She keeps asking why I\u2019m so stressed, because in her mind, him being sick isn\u2019t worth being stressed about. Reality is, her responses are more stressful to me than his sickness. I love my wife, but emotions aren\u2019t her strong suit and I have a feeling she\u2019ll continue being cold and distant about this even after talking to her. I\u2019ll try, but I have realistic hopes about her response. She\u2019s very much an \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel I\u2019m being..etc\u201d rather than being sorry I\u2019m in pain.",

Trust me, been there, got a better husband after couple's therapy helped him see how his behavior was partially leading to our downfall as a couple.",

A lot of the ones in our area are conservative counseling centers, but once we find an accepting one we\u2019re definitely planning on trying it out. We have a strong foundation, there are just some communication issues we both have (and I have BPD so she deals with a LOT from my end), and a therapist is something we both agree we should invest in!",

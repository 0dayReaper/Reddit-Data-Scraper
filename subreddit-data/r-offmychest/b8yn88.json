    "postText": "Audrey when we found you, you were 1/2 dead and 100% feral. I\u2019m glad you grew out of attacking everyone. Only took 4 years. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve learned to allow the occasional family friend to pet your head....only the head anywhere else and you bite and that took 8 years. I\u2019ve accepted that you don\u2019t really like humans and are happy just doing your own thing. But can I tell you a secret? I know you come into my room at night and snuggle me. You\u2019re not exactly sly. First of all you weigh like 20lbs. You\u2019re a fat cat. So I can feel when you walk all over me. Also girl you purr like a freight train when you\u2019re happy. And you tend to drool on my face when you stare at me. You always come in once you think I\u2019m asleep and bail when I start to wake up. You\u2019re not as sly as you think you but that\u2019s okay. I love you very much and it makes me so happy you show me love in your own special way. \n\nEdit: You guys I had no idea this would blow up and I\u2019m so happy I could touch so many of you. I just love my little kitty and needed to get it off my chest. I\u2019ve been reading her your comments. She seems pleased. \n\nI know some of you asked for a picture. I don\u2019t have an imgur but I did post it under the cats sub so you can see it on my profile :) \n\nAnd finally thank you to everyone who contributed to this post. The Silver, Gold, Platinum and comments are not lost on me and I really take those compliments to heart. ",

The people that won the kitten that came to be mine were abusing the shit outta him for fun.  I kidnapped him (or is it catnapped) and brought him home.  He was soooo AWFUL for the first few years. He was so sadistic we named him Diablo.  Attacking ours legs as we walked around the house, hissing at and attacking our guests, creepily murder stalking you while you were just tryna watch TV.  I still have a couple scars here and there from his most vicious attacks.\n\nHe was with me for 12 years before he passed away of cancer.  He slept across my legs every single night of those years.  He greeted me at the door everyday when I came home.  He would never be in a room I wasn't in and followed me everywhere I went in the house.  **He loved me...... and my God do I love and miss him.**  ",

He's quite the contrary of Audrey, he's a slim cat and his paws are so skinny, it feels like he's stabbing me every time. But I love him so much so there's nothing I can do! If I didn't take him and his siblings they were going to end up in the trash. I found his two brothers a good home and I kept him and his sister. I never thought I could have more cats since I already had two but they just made the house feel complete. ",

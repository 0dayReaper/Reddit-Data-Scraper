    "postText": "I'm almost 30 and I've fcked up. I was in college for almost 10 years and I still couldn't graduate. I only have 1 subject left. But I know that it's something I really can't accomplish. I really hated my course and I deeply regret that I did not quit earlier when I wasn't too deep in this hole that I made myself. \n\nI'm trying to look for a job now. I've only had a month at my first job then I got sick and resigned. I also regret that I should've just worked instead of paying thousands of money for tuition that didn't lead into anything because I can't apply what I studied at work. I'm incompetent at what I've studied that's why I'm trying to look for another career path. Lately I'm always mad even at the slightest inconvenience. And it's taking a toll on my partner. She literally shakes when I get mad and her chest always hurts. \n\nWe' ve had a talk yesterday and she asked if she's a part of the things that trigger my insecurities. I told her I guess so. Whenever she talks about her career and salary it just takes me into a spiral. I'm happy for her. I know it's hard to believe because I really get insecure and bitter. I told her she is not the problem and it's something I need to work on myself. \n\nSometimes I have an inferiority complex. I would constantly undermine myself. Sometimes I'm so entitled to the point that I think a lot of people are beneath me and that I deserve better. I would get bitter because I would think I'm smarter than this person and get so mad because I'd think why couldn't I even graduate. \n\nI can't really talk to my family because they panic when I get like this and I think they've also had enough. They've given me everything that I needed and I just wasted everything. You can say that I was lucky because of the support they've constantly given me before. Now I'm broke and I can't even help my family.\n\nI can't talk to my friends because I don't want them to see that I still don't have myself in a better place. I don't know but I don't want them to get the satisfaction that they're doing a really better job than me. They are probably not like that. I guess my head really is the problem. \n\nMy partner is also becoming my emotional punching bag and I want it to stop. I really hate losing even in video games and when we play I take it out on her. I'm also afraid that I'd hurt her physically. It would be the end of our relationship if it came to that. I want to manage my anger. I want to take responsibility for the life I'm in. Everything is because of the choices I made. I want to change but it's really easier said than done. \n\nI don't want to hurt people but I'm always so mad. I'm sorry.",

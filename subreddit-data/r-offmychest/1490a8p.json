    "postText": "I get super nervous before basically any social interactions, especially if I wasn\u2019t anticipating them. Like today I needed to text my friend a question. I had to spend the entire day hyping myself up to do it because I was nervous to just ask them a question. And I know them! It\u2019s not they\u2019re gonna be pissed at me or something. \n\nOr if I\u2019m going out and I know there\u2019s a chance I\u2019ll be talking to people I get really nervous. Like butterflies in my stomach, palms get sweaty, really jittery, my mind starts racing, breathing harder than usual. Often I sit in the car to hype myself up before I go in. \n\nIs this all completely normal? I feel like so many people just do social interactions so easily. They\u2019re scary to me.",

I know the pandemic made this worse for people, myself included. I\u2019m not sure how old you are but if it is something genuinely affecting your everyday life it\u2019s worth getting treatment for",

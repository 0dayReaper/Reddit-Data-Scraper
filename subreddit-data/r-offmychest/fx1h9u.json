    "postText": "I've been alone in my tiny studio apartment for weeks. Nobody has checked on me. I am so alone and I guess I'm just venting. \nMy mom is a narcissistic sociopath who I haven't seen or spoken to since I was 16. My dad is on and off the grid. I have nobody. I have supported myself since I walked out of my mom's house at 16. Nobody has checked on me since. I put myself through college. Not one person came to my graduation. I spend holidays alone. My family does not reach out even on my birthdays. \nIf something happened to me only my coworkers would know. I have one really good friend who checks on me here and there but she is married and has her own life.\n\nI've struggled to support myself since I was a literal child because my parents are insane. Like so many others, I was born with nothing. I have built something for myself, but I'm so alone. \n\nI want to belong somewhere. \n\nI am considered successful in my industry, especially for my age, but I have nobody to grow and enjoy life with. \nMaybe I'm depressed because of how things are right now, but it's making me realize just how fucking alone I am in this world. I have nobody. I don't know why some people even have children.. but I hope I find a wonderful partner. I hope I have a wonderful life. Right now things are extremely difficult. I just keep going hoping my future life will be worth it. Right now, I am so alone. I hope my life changes. I hope I don't struggle forever. \n\nThanks for reading. I dont know what the point of this is, but I hope you all are doing ok during these insane times. Sending all my love to everybody struggling with depression, loneliness, and self confidence. You are not alone.",

People are here and reading you from all over the world.\nWhatever you are feeling right now, it won\u2019t last forever.\nI don\u2019t know if this could help but, do you have any hobbies that you can share online and meet new people through it?\nFor example, I like drawing and since I have posted my art online I met new people. It might not be \u00ab\u00a0real friends\u00a0\u00bb per se but maybe that could help you.\nOr maybe try to reach any support association?\n\nAnyway, people are here with you on this subreddit. Hope you give us some news as much as you can.\n\nKisses from France.",

Even though all of this was extremely amateurish, I met sooo many wonderful people, both on the internet and in real life. Looking back, I consider that time to be the best of my life.\n\nI\u2019m more into painting and drawing these days, so if you would like an art-buddy, hit me up! ^(or if anyone else does for that matter :\u2019))",

I\u2019m not very good at either but I don\u2019t need to be. It allows me to have my distance and at the same time gives me a little thread to others that I can build on if I\u2019m comfortable.",

You are a 23 year old entirely free person with money and no goals in life. \nYou can move to another country, take a few years off, find yourself, start any number of hobbies devolope any interest. You can go to Somalia buy an AK and become a pirate within two days if you wanted to, you could build empires and watch them fall and you'd Still be a somewhat young person with their whole life infront of them in the end of it. \n\nMy advice for you, as one who has been in/ still kinda feels like being in your situation, find a hobby that you enjoy over wich you can connect to others.\n\nThe thing most people need to find friends, is a topic to talk about to get to know each other over, to find out how much you vibe with them.\n\nWether it's painting classes or language classes or any kind of sport or what the fuck ever, your lonelyness will not end on its own inside your home.\nGo to concerts, events, do things on your own, talk to people. \n\nI'd suggest doing only what you think is best for you for some time.\n\nTry to enjoy your life.",

Everyone at the start of their 20s has something that they feel will keep them in ruins forever but life is long and everything changes. \n\nAt the same time, there will always be times when you're alone as well, so accepting your own company and learning to be with it in peace is a life skill that is worth a lot, especially as a young person. \n\nI've had trouble connecting with others forever, was forced to leave home at 17 and moved countries every couple years since. I wasnt around people my own age for a long time and when I went to university I felt like david attenborough observing these creatures up close. And damn, some people are so terrified of being alone it pushes them to make the most stupid decisions, to change who they know they are to fit with people they dont even really like, or to pursue relationships that make them miserable because they need to be in one. That's why I'm saying being able to be alone is a life skill. \n\nThat's not to say give up on others or anything, but dont beat yourself up over your current situation. You're strong, and you've taken care of yourself, and there are things to be learned from everything. Good times will come, but having toughed it out alone first is an important lesson that most people skip and when they find themselves alone at some point, they fall apart",

A cat or a dog can do wonders for what you seem to be going through right now (which I can assure you is temporary). I went through a rough patch a few years ago and just happened to find a stray cat one day that really warmed up to me. I didn't even really want a pet at the time but she was so malnourished that I felt the need to help her out. I love her so so much now. She gave my life purpose when at the time I felt like I had none. A pet is completely non-judgmental &amp; always wants to be there for you.

I left home at 17, lived out of a car with my boyfriend, and worked 3 jobs for over a year to escape my narcissistic/abusive family. When I turned 18 I had to become a cam girl to make ends meet. I'm 23 now and still haven't been able to go to college or anything, and I am alone too, but when I think back on what I escaped, this is much better. I'm sure it is for you as well. \n\nIt can be really scary to have so much uncertainty, of being alone. The fear of no one to take care of you or check on you if something happens. And the added slap of seeing friends with loving support systems. What helps me sometimes is using DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) and CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy). When I feel very lonely, I treat myself like a close friend or daughter,  and think \"what does the inner child in me need right now to feel safe and cared for?\" I try my best to fulfill whatever that thing is. Doesn't always work, but it's something!\n\nAgain, you're not alone. \ud83e\udd0d Lots of us here read your post and hope you're doing okay.",

Sometimes, not having family around can be a good thing, especially if they are toxic. I speak from experience. \nIt may seem like rainbows and roses to have a big family and a bunch of \u201cfriends\u201d. The truth is, many people in those situations wouldn\u2019t mind being where you are at the moment. So much of the relationships can be strained, forced or pressured to do certain things. You\u2019re \u201cexpected\u201d to be a certain type of person. \u201cFriends\u201d can be terribly fake, and even sisters will stab you in the back. \nBUT you are so young and have plenty of time to find someone you really vibe with and one day, can have a family of your own if that is your hope!\nYou are not alone! Be strong, this is a terrible time for everyone... the loneliness is REAL. \nIt\u2019s times like these when we find out who really cares or not. \nThis is my first comment ever on here, I hope I could help a little bit. Take care of yourself! Maybe take up yoga! It has helped me for years in times of loneliness \ud83d\udc97",

But, by choice. \n\n I don't speak to my mother for reasons far too long to post in a comment, And my biological father has never been around. \n\nI was really close to my grandmother, who I shared an apartment with when I was 19. In 2018, she passed away. I stayed in that apartment and my sister (Who I've never been close to and is probably my least favorite person) moved in with her boyfriend. They treated me and the apartment like shit and made it look like I was some terrible person to my mother. \n\nSo I moved a few towns Northeast and haven't spoken to any of them in months. I now live with my girlfriend. Her and I plan to create our own family and do things our way. The way it should be. \n\nMy advice? Find someone. Doesn't have to be a romantic partner. Just someone to go out and do things when the pandemic is over. A romantic partner will come in time, as will your opportunity to do things your way and create your own family.",

I went through a decade and a half of depression before feeling like I finally have a grip on life and am succeeding and I\u2019m as happy as I ever have been .\n\nAs for dealing with the actual feelings right now , in this moment , just remember that you are a valuable person and that even if you\u2019re hurting you still able to connect with people online and are lucky to be alive in a time where that is an option . Also don\u2019t forget to read books- it\u2019s like having conversations with some of the best minds that have ever lived . Music has always helped through the worst times in life and it is a powerful emotional connection that can\u2019t be overstated.

I am an old Mum and I actually feel your despair and I am so sorry you feel this way. \n\nBut sitting on the outside here looking in I see so many upsides to your life too, OK that's easy for me to say but bear with me. You have done so many things that MOST people never do once in their lives. You escaped from a dire situation. You are amazing for doing that alone! Many people never get the power within to achieve that or, worse, are never able to do that. \n\nYou have survived but more importantly you did better than survive - you excelled. Say that again to yourself - you excelled! Some survive, some exist but you excelled. Wow! \n\nBut a little motherly advice here (sorry comes with the territory) look outside yourself. Right now that is not possible but once we are all out of isolation go and do something. Jobs are ok but not great for making friends because you have to be there but hobbies or volunteering is different. Join something you really want to do - for instance I love helping people so I am a member of a search and rescue organisation. No money just mega good feels when we find someone but it's the friends, amazing close wonderful friends that make it so good.\n\nYou may have nobody physically close right now but you do have a whole world of redditors out here who think you are amazing, who admire you and support you.

    "postText": "My (19M) sister (16F) has been acting real crazy these days. I get it, she\u2019s getting to those teenage years where she\u2019s really out of control and she\u2019s really disrespectful towards our parents. My dad keeps telling me to sort her out. I\u2019ve told her many times I don\u2019t really give a flying fuck what she does just don\u2019t touch my shit. She hasn\u2019t crossed that bridge\u2026yet. List of things she does:\n\n1. Stays out late and comes home at midnight\n\n2. Tells our parents to fuck off whenever they get in her personal space\n\n3. Brakes things when she gets mad\n\n\n4. Steals money from my mums purse\n\n\nIt\u2019s not much but I still think it\u2019s enough to speak to her about her behaviour. I went through this phase too but not to this level. I gotta admit I don\u2019t make it easier cause I laugh at her antics when I really shouldn\u2019t. I can\u2019t help it, the girl is hilarious at times. I\u2019m going to talk to her in the morning about her behaviour, what do I even say? I\u2019ve overheard my dad say to my mum that it\u2019s soo hard raising a girl cause he doesn\u2019t know what to do. As much as I find it funny, I love my sister so I don\u2019t want her getting into some deep shit that can\u2019t be reversed.",

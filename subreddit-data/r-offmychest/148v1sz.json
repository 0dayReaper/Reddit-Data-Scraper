    "postText": "To keep it simple: my dad\u2019s been dead 10 years, and I miss him terribly. I have prolonged complicated grief, and still feel emotionally as though he\u2019s just died, and have been looking at ways which may help me grieve. I decided to write him a letter (inside a greetings card) and found it helped\u2026except for the part where I can\u2019t send the card anywhere..because he\u2019s dead. I tried to see if there were any charities which accepted these letters - but found no luck. I guess now I need ideas on how to get rid of it (burning is not an option due to my neighbours).",

    "postText": "I was 17 when we met, the hight of internet chat rooms. He was 24. A PhD student living across the country.  We chatted for hours. I had stopped going to physical school because of illness and did distance learning. I was incredibly isolated so he quickly became the most intimate relationship. We moved to phone calls  and he would call me at least 4x a week for 2hours plus. This was us for the next 5 years. It was clear there was something there for both of us. A true love. It was never sexual or anything. Just jokes, heartaches and listening to eachother. \n\nI started dating some one and asked him to back off in respect. He did. He always does - much to my annoyance.  We didn't talk for 3 years. I moved to a different country and one day got a long email from him. The cycle repeated. Then, he started dating some one. I back off put of respect. \n\nI moved back home. I was depressed and really struggling. I hated it here. I reached out to him for distraction and support. He obliged. Happily. \n\n2 years later we had a monumental fight. I told him to just marry the woman he was with because I would never talk to him. He did. \n\nWe didn't talk for another 7 years. Like we used, to I mean. I caved. I messaged him one day and the friendship took off again. \n\nAlas, he was married and every time I met up with him it was the white elephant in the room. I knew it was aweful that I was even entertaining this relationship but it had been 17 years! He stood me up one day and nothing to say for it. I told him never to talk to me every again. That night he professed his undying love for me. That I was the person he loved the most in this world. It made me so angry. I ghosted him. \n\n6 weeks ago, he found me on a messaging app I forgot I still had (I had blocked him on other platforms) \n\nWe have been talking every day since. Yes. He is still married. He will be coming to my city for a business trip in 2 days. We will be spending some time together - he asked to fly in a little earlier. The job granted this. \n\nI'm so torn. I get the moral aspects so please don't come at me for that. I get it. I really do. But, this is the man I've compared every other man to for the past 20 years! Never really loved any one fully - only one foot on the ground in case he would show up. \n\nI understand all that you might want to say if he really loved me he would have waited .... blah blah. But, I know life is more nuanced than that and sometimes the timing is off, or one person isn't in the right space...",

This guy should a like bad news to me. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason why you blocked him Op don\u2019t forget the reason",

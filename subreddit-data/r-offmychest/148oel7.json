    "postText": "My bf and I broke up in February, which really took an emotional and mental toll on me. It kinda came from out of nowhere but I found out he was cheating on me and I immediately ending things. I think I cried for a week straight and just went into a really bad depressive episode, I could never turn the lights on in my house, I barely ate once a day, and I would lay in bed until 1 or 2 in the afternoon because I was too sad to get up. We talked on and off for a little bit afterwards but I realized that we would never work things out, and the only way for me to grow was to cut ties with him completely. We went no contact for a month which was great at first, but eventually not so much. He was making fake accounts to stalk my social media as much as he could, and saw that I posted online about someone asking me out on a date. He completely went off on me, threatening to leak my nudes online.  texting and calling me with 10 fake phone numbers in one day, and he even made a fake complaint about me at work. Everyday I feel like I\u2019m about to have a panic attack or mental breakdown and just see my nudes posted for everyone to see. The day he texted me with 10 fake numbers I ended up unblocking his number and calling him, and I told him I would keep him unblocked because I don\u2019t want my phone blowing up with random numbers again whenever he wants to go off on me. I haven\u2019t heard anything since, but I feel like I can\u2019t even block him again or he\u2019ll just be upset and leak my nudes or go crazy on me. At work, some people have found out about the complaint, so now I have to worry about people gossiping about me. I started going to therapy when we first went no contact, but my therapist is pretty booked and can only see me about every 3 weeks. I feel like he holds this power over me and I can\u2019t ever move on, no matter how much I try. It\u2019s so emotionally draining, and I feel stuck in place all the time.",

I know this is hard, but you\u2019ll be grateful you got evidence if he causes you to lose your job or get hurt in someway. As soon as he leaks those nudes, put up his threats about leaking them. Stay safe.",

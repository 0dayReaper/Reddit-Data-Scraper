    "postText": "I\u2019m not just talking about bad exes, I mean people as in my parental figures. I watched my mom go through intense unstable relationships with men after she and my father figure divorced when I was 6. He remarried another woman but they were both not emotional people, I can count more times I\u2019ve heard scream matches between them than hearing an \u2018I love you\u2019 \n\nFast forward to my late teens and beginning of young adulthood. Anyone who showed the slightly bit of interest in me and made me feel kinda nice about myself, I\u2019d idolize and believe it was love. It took a long time to realize it was never love I felt, I just liked the attention I was getting for once. I found myself in relationships that were very bad for me and left me pretty traumatized with how things often ended. \nI\u2019m doing better in that sense now that I\u2019m alone again, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m on the aromantic spectrum because of it all. I\u2019ve had time to think about it, it sucks because my biggest wish was to love someone and now I don\u2019t think I can.. sometimes if I think a little too hard about it I start crying as if I\u2019m mourning my loss. It doesn\u2019t feel fair at all, I\u2019m so lonely. I try to fill it with friends, family, people I meet. But it feels like nothing really stays full in my chest, it drains out quickly. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019ll stay like this forever, it\u2019s trauma related and I\u2019ve been getting help. I hope someday I can meet the right partner. For now it\u2019s a lonely journey on my own until I\u2019m completely healed.",

    "postText": "We broke up just a couple months ago, will always love her though. We still live together because of logistics which isn\u2019t ideal but it is what it is right now. She had a guy over after coming home from a party  and unfortunately woke to the sound of them absolutely going at it. I turned on rain sounds on full blast but unfortunately wasn\u2019t able to fall back asleep knowing that was going on. Sucks /:\n\nEdit: thanks for the well wishes to those who offered them, im going to get some comfort food and a beer or two and try to enjoy my night. I have family visiting soon so I\u2019m just trying to look forward to that\n\nAlso to add: a lot of people are saying have a chat with her, I plan on it to discuss boundaries and such. I just know if I did the same thing she would be super upset, so I\u2019m not going to fight fire with fire. Give respect - get respect.\n\nLast edit: we did have a little chat and it went well. She apologized sincerely for not being quieter and explained how she completely understands why it would be upsetting, and that she would be upset if the roles were reversed.  We talked about how this is a tricky situation, boundaries, and how to move forward with being respectful to each other while still having our own privacy and things of that sort. We are going to talk about possibly moving into different apartments if we can both afford to do so. Thanks again for everyone\u2019s kind words and advice. Hopefully we can move past this and continue to co-exist with civility and respect for each other.",

Neither of us could afford to move out and were stuck on a lease. He screwed her over our bathroom sink, so when I went to get ready for work in the morning, her oily ass face print was on the mirror. Then the next week, he left his bedroom door open and one of my dogs dragged her stripper lookin thong out into the hallway. \ud83e\udee0 (nothing against strippers- make that cash. Lol) \n\nBut yes, I share the same sentiments. I hope OP can heal quickly from this. I am now happily married and we have a 10 month old. Only took me a couple years of leaving that d bag to find my husband. My forever best friend. It will happen for you too, OP!! I\u2019m so sorry you are going through this, and I know it hurts so much right now, but please remember that you will find your person. &lt;3",

Meaning, I don't think that it would be an unreasonable or unfair request/boundary to make, especially because you are both stuck living together for the time being. Y'all both should have the right to live comfortably in your own shared home, regardless of your new relationship status. For you, that includes not having to hear her getting it on w/ other people. \n\nThe parameters and reasons of your living together have changed. Therefore the rules, expectations, and boundaries of living together have also changed, and y'all should discuss those new rules, expectations, and boundaries to minimize future discomfort/pain.",

By staying with someone that toxic, you\u2019re torturing yourself and your mental health will decline. \n\nYou need to tell her that what she did is unacceptable in your arrangement and if she does it again, you will break the lease and leave. She can either find another roommate or stop banging dudes while you\u2019re home. By the way, she 100% knows what she did was fucked up because anyone would know.  \n\nI really hope you stop making excuses and start standing up for your mental health. Does she have the legal right to do what she did? Sure, but it was not ethical, moral, or the least but considerate. Good luck and know you deserve so much better treatment.",

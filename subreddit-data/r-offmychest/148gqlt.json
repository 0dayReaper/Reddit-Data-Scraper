    "postText": "Hi. So yesterday my school had an award show, thing. It\u2019s like, who was the best at this or who did the most of that and who won scholarships. You get it. I won an award for graphic design. That\u2019s sounds great but the thing is. I didn\u2019t deserve it. All my artwork is lazy and dull. There are so many people in my class that are much better at it than me. One girl. All call her A. A ridiculously good at it and has a great work ethic. Or this another guy. Who had never done graphic design before. Still make\u2019s better art then me. I don\u2019t. They should have given it to someone else. I feel selfish and sad. Idk. I just need to say it.",

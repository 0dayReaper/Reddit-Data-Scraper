    "postText": "SH and Dereality CW. Also, sorry this is such a novel. \n\nI have a disorder called DP/DR, AKA Depersonalization/Derealization. I\u2019ve had it since I was very young, but was only diagnosed within the last few years. I\u2019m not sure exactly what the cause of it was, but I have had a lot of traumas and even drug addiction in my life, which undoubtedly had a hand in it.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, DP/DR is a disorder in which you suffer from prolonged episodes of Derealization and Depersonalization. Derealization is when you feel as if you are disconnected from the world, almost like a dream. Like the world is not real, and you\u2019re stuck in it. Depersonalization is pretty much the opposite. You feel as if you are the only one who isn\u2019t real, and the world around you is. However, this is a very simplified explanation. Usually DP/DR is developed as a form of coping-- basically, the brain disconnecting itself to stop itself from worrying about the consequences of reality.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my DP/DR was less noticeable. Because when you\u2019re a kid, nothing feels real anyway. So it was, at least for me, a lot more manageable. But as a teen, it got bad. So bad I wouldn\u2019t leave my room for weeks, believing wholeheartedly that it had only been a couple days. I was living off of stale crackers and crumbs (yes, crumbs) that were in my room. I truly did not believe anything I did had real consequences. \n\nBut even as a kid, certain aesthetics and visuals really triggered something in me. Like the Windows 98 wallpaper featuring an idyllic pale blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The muted color palette of Sims 1 and 2. The old-school Nickelodeon website... etc. The visuals would give me this weird, uncanny feeling in me that would make me super uncomfortable. Even older episodes of SpongeBob and ANYTHING that would have been deemed \u201cFrutiger Aero\u201d.\n\nI kinda lost that sensation as a teen. That was because I was surrounding myself with things that were pleasing to me, as anyone would. However in my late teens, the resurgence of \u201cWeirdcore\u201d and \u201cDreamcore\u201d, along with \u201cLiminal Spaces\u201d came crashing into me like a train on a hell tread. I\u2019d spend hours scrolling through photo after photo after photo, and this is where I learned the term \u201cDereality\u201d, a term to describe the physical experience of Derealization.  These photos triggered that same uncanny feeling I had all those years ago, and oddly enough, I couldn\u2019t get enough. I was obsessed with the feeling, and I saw so many others who were experiencing the same feeling. Some called it \u201cDereality\u201d, some called it \u201cAnemoia\u201d. \n\nI am now an adult and these images still strike a VERY strong feeling in me. After years of consuming those photos nonstop, I was triggering myself daily, sending myself into long and drawn-out DP/DR episodes. My DP/DR became so extreme, I began having seizures and hallucinations. Anything too uncanny or \u201coff\u201d puts me in an episode, I\u2019ve become hypersensitive to it. One of my favorite films \u201cHausu\u201d, features a scene where a character\u2019s silhouette is cut and replaced with stock footage of fire. It looked like something straight out of Windows Movie Maker. It made me so physically sick, I almost vomited. Not from fear, but from that weird feeling I got. \n\nI know it sounds silly, and to some, it IS silly. I\u2019ve seen people make fun of those who experience this feeling on TikTok and Twitter, mocking them and claiming \u201cthey\u2019re just pictures.\u201d\nWhich they\u2019re right, they are just pictures. And not everyone experiences this kind of thing. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, of course. However this disorder has been especially crippling for me as of late. I\u2019ve taken a much-needed break from indulging in that self destructive habit of scrolling mindlessly through these blogs full of Weirdcore and Dreamcore photos. One night, I began to self harm, believing there would be no consequence because I was not real, none of what was happening was real. I started to have a seizure, a pseudo-seizure as some call them; where I was semi-conscious and aware of my seizing. It was horrific. Another night, I was convinced a neon green portal was in my closet, trying to convince me to go into it and live in a weird dimension. Makes no sense now, but I was in absolute terror. My ex had to hold me and keep me calm. The most recent debacle being I accidentally took 60 pills in the span of 3 days because my perception of time is completely and utterly fucked. My family now has to monitor my meds to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again. \n\nWhen I spoke to my doctor about this, they told me it might be a form of epilepsy associated with DP/DR. Stress-induced. The hallucinations were a product of how much my brain and body couldn\u2019t handle my delusions, and was filling in the gap. So I FELT as if I were in a dream state, and I pretty much was/am.\n\nI just hate how weird and stupid it sounds when I try to explain this to people I know. Even my own mom kinda scoffs and laughs, because she just can\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t blame her or anyone for that matter. I just hope, once I\u2019m able to, I can find a medication that can help. Because frankly, living like this is not fun. It keeps me tied down. I\u2019ve been on a couple meds, some of which just made my problem worse. If anyone has advice for grounding, I\u2019d love to hear it. Usually to ground myself, if I\u2019m aware enough to do it, I\u2019ll eat sour candy or play with my pets. It helps most times, but not always.",

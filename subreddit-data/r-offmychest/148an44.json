    "postText": "I was in a big argument, I didn't even know what I did wrong or even IF I did anything wrong but she started yelling at me and calling me stupid, my own mother. She said I was stupid because \"I didn't know what was best for me and if I did then I'd treat her better\". I don't know what I did and I'm so confused, I haven't slept in 4 days and feel like absolute shit. I asked her what I did and she thought I was mocking her. Whenever I say something or comment or try to lighten the mood by making a joke she screams at me for doing something wrong. I don't know what I did and I'm angry. I kept a nuetral face as she was yelling at me because I didn't want her to know that I was on the verge of tears, I guess I did a good job since she started yelling at me for not reacting too. I don't want to talk to her anymore but I have to. I'm probably an asshole and I dont remember, she started yelling at me for something I did 2-3 days ago but I don't remember doing anything. I don't remember half the argument either, went outside in my pyjamas because I forgot I wasn't wearing actual clothes and I wasn't allowed to change because we were late. I think there's something wrong with my memory because I can't remember a lot of stuff but I'm too scared to get that checked out. She self diagnosed herself with ADHD even if she has none of the symptoms, I don't wanna call her out for it because at this point I can't tell if I'm ever saying something good or bad. Meahnwhile she belittles my ADHD and yells at me even more for being \"incompetent\". I keep being told how I'm feeling and thinking even if I don't know myself. She asks me how I can love myself when I'm such a bad person, I want to curl up in a ball and cry but I'm too tired for that. She was nice a few hours ago and everything was fine and I don't know what happened, I don't know a lot of things or what's going on, I need to write this down because I can't keep this all bottled up forever.

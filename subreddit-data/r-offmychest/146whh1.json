    "postText": "I have been married for 3 years now, and we dated for 2 years before that My wife is my best friend, we have a lot of fun together and I can tell her anything. But she will not have sex with me. We have done it once this year. It\u2019s been this way since getting married, and I\u2019m at a point where I just feel completely unwanted. \nI\u2019ve brought up my concerns to her multiple times, and the response is always the same. \u201cI am attracted to you, and I like having sex with you. We can definitely do it more.\u201d But then something gets in the way: it\u2019s too late tonight, she says she\u2019s not clean enough, she ate too much food, work is stressful so she can\u2019t think about it. At this point, it is painful to even ask. \nI have brought up the pattern and suggested possibilities. Maybe we should schedule time for it, maybe there\u2019s something i could do to get her more in the mood, maybe her birth control is messing with her libido, maybe I\u2019m not giving her physical pleasure/sex is painful. She tells me no, sex feels good and she likes it with me and she wants it too. \nLast night I tried to initiate for the first time in a few weeks. She said she needed to shower first and she would be ready if I go lay in the bed first. We\u2019ve been here before :/ i lay in bed for over an hour and fall asleep before she is done. \nThis has been so consistent that I\u2019ve turned to porn as an outlet. At this point, my self-esteem is so low that I can\u2019t even be desirable in my fantasies and I consume stuff that ultimately just makes me sad. I\u2019ve even told my wife that my porn habits are a problem, but she isn\u2019t bothered because I seem to need the outlet. When I responded by saying that it is a problem because I need affection from a real person, we got into an argument that went nowhere. I\u2019m tired of begging for sex and feeling unwanted and repulsive every time I\u2019m inevitably told no",

            "comment": "*I have some advice as someone who went though something similar. Please ignore if you don't want advice! Not trying to push it on you, but felt compelled to share what worked for us.*\n\n&gt;Maybe we should schedule time for it. \n\nThis is actually not that far fetched. However, instead of scheduling doing the deed specifically - schedule a **date night.** \n\nThis will give you the opportunity to set the mood. It allows her time to \"prepare\" prior to the date so she's feeling clean/attractive enough to get to it!\n\nI'm not saying you need to go on some expensive date! I merely mean whatever constitutes as a date for you. It could be as simple as going for a walk in the park and picking up a sandwich. The important thing is it needs to be something she will *naturally get prepared for.* \n\n&gt;\u201cI am attracted to you, and I like having sex with you. We can definitely do it more.\u201d But then something gets in the way: it\u2019s too late tonight, she says she\u2019s not clean enough, she ate too much food, work is stressful so she can\u2019t think about it.\n\nIt's that section that has me giving this particular advice.\n\nTo me (and I could be totally wrong since I'm an outsider) this says she desires you sexually but doesn't feel sexual herself. She enjoys the act and doesn't want to half-arse it. She wants to be at her best when having sex with you. When one is tired, stressed or haven't showered it can be difficult to see yourself as attractive, even if your partner still thinks you're the most attractive thing in the world.\n\nHaving a set date night helps with this.\n\n*It's kind of like leaving the house for a party. If the invitation suddenly pops up saying to \"arrive in 5 minutes\" then stress sets in. There's no time to \"get ready\" to see people and socialize. If you know in advance you're going to an event you have time to get in the mindset to socialize. You have the information needed to know how to schedule your day: IE not wearing yourself out prior to the event. If you don't know you won't be getting sleep, then you will be extra tired from staying up late the night before.*\n\n&gt;i lay in bed for over an hour and fall asleep before she is done.\n\nJust like that!!! Since you didn't know you'd be waiting your oomph fizzled out and you fell asleep. As much as you wanted it your body went night-night. It's not that you didn't want her once she was ready!\n\nAnother fix that worked for us was to have a system for when of us was in the mood. Are you familiar with the concept of putting a tie on your doorknob to signify to dormmates the room is \"in use?\"\n\nSimilarly you set up a signal for when she is in the mood. In our home we will draw a smiley face on the whiteboard if we're open to advances. It's a green light that, whoever drew the smiley, is feeling frisky and open to advances. Since she's the one who is more hit/miss with feeling sexual she should be the one to make a sign.",

                    "comment": "This is so true! Schedule intimacy. For my wife, she needed affection to be about intimacy and not about sex. Just because I am always ready for sex, doesn\u2019t mean she is. She needs to feel desired in not just a sexual way. When I made sure to have intimacy and affection in places where it was clear we weren\u2019t going to have sex, it made sex more common. She felt like I was only trying to initiate sex, not tying to have affection. Communication is key here. We have three kids and it\u2019s tough finding time when we are not tired. That means scheduling. I would joke about or drop hints during the day when I knew we would have alone time that night. It reminds me to tell her how great she looks, how much I want her. I also would make sure to clean around the house and get some domestic things done so that there is not a concern that could cloud her thoughts. Anxiety is a huge libido killer.\n\nWhat is getting in the way? You need to talk to her. If she is not feeling beautiful she needs to know you desire her, not just want to use her for sex. Tell her how beautiful she is. Show her you mean it. \n\nMake sure she is not worried about bills, chores, work, aging, life, or anything that could be keeping her from desiring sex. The list could go on and on. A man can have sex to forget about problems, but a woman must forget about problems to want to have sex. These two things are polar opposites. Date night could help distress and forget about problems.\n\nGood luck",

I think for many of us, it is hard to just flip a switch and be ready. Once it has been outright requested it almost feels like being backed in to a corner. I much prefer a warm up, meaning hours or even days in advance, of little intimacies that are not sexual. Mix things that are  very simple (hand holding, slight touches in passing) with things that are a bit more steamy WITHOUT trying to go all the way",

Women often don\u2019t feel attractive enough, or sexy enough, that\u2019s why foreplay is very important.  Foreplay doesn\u2019t necessarily mean physical touch (although there\u2019s something to be said about a good sension of heavy petting, and making out without intercourse), for some individuals, it could be the date night, the catering and paying attention to, the act of making the other person feel wanted and sexy.  Men are horny at the drop of a hat, they think about sex, or even just a body part, and boom they\u2019re horny, for women it becomes much more complicated. What gets her turned on? Have you ever discussed it? What makes her feel attractive, wanted, sexy?\nUltimately, you both need to find out what\u2019s affecting her libido, and discuss it with a professional-either a doctor/obgyn, or a sex therapist.  It\u2019s time to focus on her, her needs and desires, and that, in the end, is what will help get you laid",

By starting to fix what was the root issue in our personal relationship I was able to see things from his perspective.\n\nBy having date night and communicating via signals we were able to have ways to communicate better. We were able to connect via date night, and the fact he was willing to put in that effort showed me he cared and was willing to work with me. We're 8+ years strong and haven't had any hiccups since. Having a designated night for talking about our issues and bonding really cut out any opportunity for things to build up. \n\nOf course, this all is specific to me and my partner. His willingness to work on things and his reason for our issues could be completely different than what's at play with OP. \n\nMy situation was what I spoke on, which I tried to preface the message with but may have done a poor job of getting across. \n\nI do wish I had more insightful advice to offer.",

            "comment": "I broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years a couple weeks ago. We had fine enough sex lives for the first few months, and then for whatever reason it all went downhill. I think I assumed in the beginning he would/could get better at it and learn and try my multitude of kinks with me, as that's what we discussed before we ever even had sex. But that did not happen, and then I was just dating my best friend. We got engaged after dating for about 2 years, I said yes but never wore the ring and never brought it up again because I was already incredibly unhappy. Before I knew it, we were going months without having sex or really any intimacy. We had countless conversations about how to fix it and what I/he wanted. Maybe we would end up having sex once or twice out of like pity or obligation after a fight, but it was genuinely always horrible and I just felt like I wanted it to be over. Sex to him was like bang, bang, done, vanilla missionary style.  \n\nThere was a specific point where I knew it was going to be over very soon. It was my 21st birthday and I asked him for a hug and he refused to give me one. We got into an argument because I didn't want to go do one of his hobbies with him. The next day, I flew out back to my home state to visit family for a week and when he dropped me off at the airport, he gave me the world's tiniest kiss ever barely on my lips, said \"love you\" and then bolted. I was sitting there thinking, \"Is this how I went to spend the next 3 years of my life?\" The answer was no and I broke up with him a few days later. It wasn't necessarily the final straw, but it made me realize that there is no way he loves me anymore and no way I love him.\n\nPerhaps my biggest reason for realizing that we were incompatible was when I started fantasizing about other people, particularly one friend I had. I never acted on it because I didn't want to be a cheater or hurt him in that way, but I knew I wanted somebody else. \n\nAfter breaking up, I realized some things. Whenever he would get upset, it would be a full meltdown and closing me off to everything. He would promise he would go to therapy but would never make any moves to. I felt like his mother. I applied for him for his long term job after him being on/off again unemployed. I made him his resume. I made him his debit card because he would never do it. I helped show him how to buy a car, despite me never having done it myself. I taught him all the shit about how to live an adult life even though he was 5 years older than me. \n\nUltimately, I gave everything I had in hopes of making the relationship work. I relocated everything about my life, gave up comfort and stability for what I thought was love. \n\nOP- ask yourself this question: do you want to spend the next 5 years with your wife living your life how it is right now?",

So, thank you for your honesty. \n\nI think there\u2019s some great advice in the comments. One thing I would add is that \u2018the thing is never the thing\u2019 especially when it comes to sex. My sense is that (and I might be wrong) is that somewhere she is not able to tell you 100% truth about what is happening with her. Whatever the reason is - not wanting to disappoint you/ not knowing what she wants and likes etc etc. But at the core of the issue is not being able to have a raw\u2026100% truthful no holes barred conversation without fearing that it will trigger each other. \n\nThat\u2019s where I would start. Sending love",

Besides the libido issues others have mentioned could she be harbouring some sort of resentment for you that hasnt been addressed, or could something have changed to make her less attracted to you (not you becoming less attractive, but something that has altered her perception in some way)",

Tell her for the last time what's going on. Ask her if she knows how many times you have had sex this year and if this is normal for her in a marriage. Tell her that you certainly can't stay in this marriage if you will continue to live together like best friends or roommates. If she continues to do her thing, make a clean line under this relationship before you start cheating. Everyone deserves their personal happiness in a relationship!",

It could be a variety of different reasons; she could be stressed out, naturally low libido, could be birth control, she could be insecure, she could be asexual, she might just not want to have sex with you. \nI personally am asexual, and rarely have sex with my partner because it doesn\u2019t interest me. When we do, I do it for them and not for myself because no matter what, I can\u2019t feel anything. I love them very much and we have figured out a compromise considering they have a higher sex drive.\nTalk to her and hopefully you guys can figure it out. Good luck!",

I didn't want anyone else, always felt like my body wasn't responding right, loved the heck out of my partner, and had a pleasant time in the moment when we did it (until I got the wrong partner, but that's neither here nor there). But I never found myself asking. Time kept passing between encounters in long stretches without me perceiving a loss. I had more than one partner tell me they needed to seek sex outside the relationship. In the long run, I couldn't BE in a relationship. Perhaps one day I will find a human (gender affiliation irrelevant) who just wants to do laundry and taxes with me.\n\nAsk her. Not if she's ace; that might trigger major denial of the issue and backstep any progress. Ask her if she notices the gap. If the gap bothers her. If it doesn't, she might be on the grey spectrum.",

Or during her time of learning about sex she came to believe somehow sex to be ...dirty, somehow unwholesome (from the excuses it seems her understanding of sex is ...lacking)? There is something there. If her very low libido/lack interest in sex is of religious nature, I would recommend the book \"God invented sex\". However, whatever may have been, she needs to address it AND (by all means) see that she needs to develop her understanding beyond it. In perhaps the more \"innocent\" perspective, maybe some of her hormones may be lacking? But this too should be addressed.\n\nYou definitely need to see a counselor together. You should eventually, and sooner than later, tell her that this is a problem, and it needs solving, and counsel and therapy exist for this very reason.\n\nEdit: in hindsight, you are an exceptionally patient husband. Please for the health of your mind and being find counseling. \nIf she is a real friend she should care more. Porn is damaging, and she should know and do better.\n\nEdit: additional observations",

Or a period of touch that often feels very nonsexual.  Brushing hair, massage.  \n\nThis is why so many successful couples upthread are describing schedules or some hours of playful banter.",

It might be worth looking in to - individually and as a couple.  Not because your relationship is irrevocably broken or you have utterly failed at communicating - neither of those things is likely to be true - but because even when we are doing great in some areas, we may be lacking or falling behind in others.  Until you both have learned and practiced the skills you need to communicate and support each other, and advocate for your own needs and wants, troubles will find you.  At 3 years you are both still learning how to be married to each other, and you're still learning how to balance 'you' as an individual and 'you' as a spouse.  Sounds crazy because three years, right?  but I am very serious.\n\nI don't know if I'm clearly communicating my point here, which is that going to therapy isn't a bad or negative thing.  It can (and in fact frequently is) an act of love and an investment into your relationship.  Don't let these issues fester and spread.  Marriages require active and regular maintenance on both of your parts if you want it to last.",

            "comment": "It's important in these situations to break down where the worst problems are. There are plenty of couples that don't have sex regularly as other couples and it works because they're honest and straightforward with their needs and problems.\n\nWhen my partner had health issues, regular sex was off the table for a couple years, but we didn't experience a lot of strain because I understood the nature of the issue and felt loved still because we adjusted our activities. \n\nOther times, she has experienced drops in libido for less tangible reasons that have been harder to deal with because it's expressed by most people as reduced desire for sex, which leads to issues when you think it's because something you're doing or not doing right, or that it's a matter of attractiveness, etc. You probably know the whole string of self-destructive thoughts that tend to spiral in your own head.\n\nFortunately for me my partner was able to talk about this as well, and it was identified as a side effect of other medical issues, and again, just the knowledge of what's the nature of the issue and that it's temporary has a huge impact on how this hits your self-esteem.\n\nYour wife *knows* that you want more sex and she obviously does *not* so lets maybe accept that. Stop expecting or hoping (for now) that you will unlock whatever dials and buttons are needed to turn on her libido. She's not stupid, she's a human being and probably as frustrated and insecure that she can't make herself enjoy something that is important to you. She is hiding this because she doesn't know how to fix it and you seem to let it go every time, and why should she feel like she needs to learn to like something she doesn't *want* to like? \n\nLibido is funny that way, it's like depression. It doesn't *want* to be repaired or fixed. It's like if you hate the taste of Brussel's Sprouts and your partner is trying to make you eat them and figure out ways to get you to actually want to eat them. It feels absurd and petty and pushy and worse it makes you feel like something is wrong with you for not liking the things, especially as media everywhere shows happy people eating Brussel's Sprouts. It's far less stressful to just dodge the whole issue and try to avoid the things entirely.\n\nSo maybe consider approaching her from this angle of sympathy for her feeling of isolation and confusion on this and with a desire to help her understand herself better. It may be in fact that you have some kind of deeper incompatibility that needs to be addressed, or it may be a simple medical issue. What is important here is that you make her understand that whatever the result, that you marriage requires truth and openness on this topic. She *has* to help you understand what the issue is or the relationship simply will not survive. She needs to understand this, and if it makes her cry and upset... well shit, so will *divorce* but that will be worse and will be unfixable.\n\nIt WILL wreck your relationship in this state, and you as well. You are spiraling a familiar pit of depression that I know can be very hard to pull out of. I would recommend that you get a therapist either way, you will need to learn to manage your own mental health whatever happens here. And maybe a therapist can help you figure out ways to approach this conversation with your wife.",

Before I was on birth control, my boyfriend and I had sex everyday, I got on it in December and we do it maybe once a month. It sucks and I feel so bad but I genuinely just don\u2019t want to. On top of that I get UTIs super easily and it just hurts to do it so I\u2019m kinda just scared to even try.\n\nI would just have an open and honest conversation with her. Be as open minded and understanding as you can cause she could be feeling awful she can\u2019t give you what you want.\n\nIgnore all those idiots saying \u201cshe\u2019s obviously cheating\u201d or telling you to cheat. That isn\u2019t the immediate or only answer to why she doesn\u2019t want to have sex. Those people are just idiots who don\u2019t understand women\u2019s bodies.\n\nGood luck op",

I went off because the prescription simply expired. Additionally, we are lesbians so accidental pregnancies are a non-issue in the BC department. After stopping, libido came back just not as strong as before. It takes some time for hormones to regulate afterwards, sometimes it never comes back. That was my case. I talked to my doctor about it and was prescribed testosterone, just a TRT dose. Our sex life has never been better.",

Do her chores for a couple of days. Take on the load of cleaning, closing out the kitchen, scrub the toilets, whatever your chores are not, and them up for her. This may help with whatever visual stressors may be along with mental ones. Don't tell her you've done the chores. If she's picky, try to do them the way she likes. Do this for a week or two. See if things change. \n\nIf you ask her how her day was and she says it's been stressful, assure her you are there to listen. Just listen, not fix things, not give advice, be on her side even if it's something silly to you.\n\nTry initiating non-sexual intimacy. Sit close to her on the couch, put your arm around her, and just exist with her. Kiss her unexpectedly, tell her she's beautiful when she probably doesn't feel it. Smile at her randomly. Ask if she wants a foot massage after a long day. Stuff that is intimate but not innately sexual. \n\nIf none of this works, suggest seeing a counselor together to help you both set goals and needs in your marriage. Approach kindly and helpful about it vs. defensive. \n\nSome people just aren't as sexually inclined, and she may feel like if she doesn't agree, then you'll be upset with her. For me, having less in my mind and non-sexual contact helps a ton with my libido. \n\nI hope this helps some.",

You can express your support in this and tell her you are ready to hear it all\u2026 \n\nSeveral factors can lead to a decrease in sex.

For example, when someone asked him in front of me if he'd be more comfortable performing oral sex on a man or on a woman, he said a man because it would be cleaner since any significant amounts of fluid could be avoided. Considering that he had trouble staying hard after performing oral sex (15 seconds at most), that tracked. He didn't have any issues asking for oral sex to be performed on him before that but he did have the good grace not to ask again after that question came up.\n\nAnother example, late on a sweaty summer day when his last shower was the morning before, he wanted to have sex before his shower since he was just going to get dirty again. While I understand the logic, earlier that day, he visibly cringled when moving a pair of my underwear out of the dryer even after being told they were clean.\n\nDuring sex, touching me was only done if asked and only for a few half hearted seconds, at best. Foreplay was him touching himself. Kissing was the kissing that you get from a grandparent that wishes you had remained living out of state. Sex was me getting a cardio workout and him getting off. We had discussed the issue which resulted in a few seconds of me being touched followed by the same. He swore he was attracted to me and that I wasn't gross. I finally got to the point where I wouldn't even hug him hello unless I was freshly showered. It didn't matter, he still flinched when he touched me in any sexual way. He was fine with holding hands and non sexual touch, at least.\n\nI finally gave up trying to make sex better and resigned myself to the reality that my body was repulsive to him. I figured him initiating was proof enough that he liked me in that way and I would have to be satisfied with that. I was not.\n\nSince then, I just do not want to be touched and see someone repulsed ever again. So I avoid being touched. I'll get over it eventually. Perhaps she had a similar experience?",

There is a reason they call iy the honeymoon phase.  3 years in, unless she is pregnant (possible?) You guys should still be fucking like rabbits. If it's to this point that early, you need to start considering the end I think.  Sorry to say that guy, but sex and intimacy are vital to a successful healthy marriage.  When my wife and I are the grouchiest with each other, it's cuz it's been too long, and we need that connection. \n\nHave you thought about the possibility, and if not, consider it... Could she be cheating on you?  Her behavior is text book for someone that is finding intimacy elsewhere. She doesn't need it from you because she is getting it somewhere, would be my bet. If you're certain that is totally outside the realm of possibility, ypu need to be honest with her.  More honest anyway.  Ypu need to explain to her the gravity of this, and that you see it ending your marriage, and soon, if it doesn't change.  Her need to shower excuse is understandable if she gas just finished hard working out and is stinky, but otherwise, I feel like that's a big dodge.  Especially if you are waiting an hour and she still doesn't show.  Sounds like she is waiting for you to fall asleep.\n\nSorry man, probably not what you want to hear, but there is no sense wasting both of your time, if she isn't into the marriage enough to be intimate.  That is foundational, and impossible without it.  I've been married to my wife for nearly 15 yrs, 3 kids, snd we have sex atheist weekly, if not more.  I know I can speak for her too when I say, if our frequency changes to once/6 months, both she and I would feel the way you do.  Your feelings are valid.  Something isn't right if she isn't into it that early on.  If she isn't cheating, it's something else.  You gotta make her be honest, or I'd get papers written up and served.",

    "postText": "I am graduating high school this Friday. Even though it was I have had countless bad memories both in school and out of school, I still will kind of miss it. \n\nI also didn't really make any memories in high school. I didn't make or have friends, I didn't go to any school events, and I didn't have any school spirit in general. \n\nIs it normal to feel this way?",

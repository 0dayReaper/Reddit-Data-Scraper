We competed with the Papa Johns and pizza huts AND we were on the edge of the city and served a few towns, so our delivery range was wiiiide and I'd frequently find myself in unfamiliar areas. We couldn't afford more than 2 drivers on shift on any given night, which made Fridays and Saturdays grueling with chained-deliveries, and so I needed to find optimum paths from one point to the next quickly.\n\nAt one point I had bought a flip-page wire-bound street mapbook of our entire county to keep in the car. It had an index of every street name that you'd look up with the page number and grid location on that map page. It was handy in a pinch, and kept me going for years until it got out of date with new developments and such.\n\nThat said, delivering pizzas in high school and college exposed me to the realities of people/the world at an early age in my career. It's humbling. I would look up to the older delivery drivers I'd work with; the knack and intuition they'd demonstrate hunting down obscure addresses was an inspiration to me.

After years of working underpaid jobs because they couldn\u2019t get a quality education and reeducation is a distant dream due to responsibilities like kids, parents etc, they took a risk of leaving a job which they know is stable, to the delivery scene which is new to them. I guess they\u2019re making more money than what they used to make, good for them. Also much happier to be tipping someone who is earning to make a living for his family.",

    "postText": "\n\n\nYes you read that right. I\u2019m a 27 year old female virgin and I feel like a loser. I know our society and media is oversexualized but I tend to think I\u2019m a loser for being a virgin later in life. Doesn\u2019t our media make fun of people who are virgins later in life (the 40 year old virgin for example)? I have been made fun of for being a virgin years ago when I was in college and I tended to internalize that ever since. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m going to grow too old and I won\u2019t be attractive anymore and no one will want me. I have been meaning to wait until a met a nice guy and I felt comfortable with him. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t have casual sex. I tend to think sex is a big deal and not something I should just do with anyone.\n\n I didn\u2019t date in high school because I went to an all girls school and I was dealing with a lot of insecurities and self confidence issues. By the time I got to college I felt very behind socially and instead of putting myself out there to meet guys, I just focused on school and working on my career. I was also dealing with a lot of insecurities and confidence issues all through college and grad school. \n\nI\u2019m finally at a place now where I am doing well financially and I have started my career and I\u2019m putting myself out there to date. But part of me still feels like a loser. Will guys find it a turn off for me being a virgin while in my late twenties. I keep feeling like I have to explain myself as though there is something wrong with me. Everyone reassured me that I\u2019m not a loser but I don\u2019t believe them. I feel like I\u2019m not even a real woman because I haven\u2019t had sex.",

Sex isn\u2019t everything and it doesn\u2019t define you. Sex is everywhere nowadays. On TV, magazines, social media, etc\u2026 it\u2019s painted as this huge thing that everyone needs to participate in regularly otherwise they are weird. The people who promote that kind of message are the losers, not you.\n\nJust because other women have had sex doesn\u2019t make them any more woman than you are. There are many things that make you a woman. Your drive, your achievements, the connections you make, the love you show to others, the obstacles you have overcome. You\u2019re reducing your self worth and self perception down to whether or not you\u2019ve had a d-ck in you. Think about that. \n\nI know how it feels to be really insecure, so i completely understand why you feel this way, but please don\u2019t base your value on whether or not you\u2019ve slept with someone. It will only make you feel worse!",

I admire you, you're not involved in situations that would make you vulnerable to having your vCard stolen, you're focused on your career-great for self sustained life, and honestly you're keeping to older values and core beliefs, so you're not going to end up with a schmuck. Keep that up and you will find the right partner who holds those same values and you will both be at a higher standard for one another.\n\nI'm saying nothing for others who have lost it early, mine was stolen at 16. I'm not dissing on others, just encouraging that beauty of romance and love that Jane Austen promoted so much in her books.",

She, like you, has nothing to prove to anyone, and completely content in how she is. You are both real women, sex doesn't make it so. Be confident in who you are because that's who you know best. You will grow and change with every life decision you make, the best part for you is how many great choices you have made so far. Still being one says that you're not going to make a whim choice, you're going to be critical and selective. As women in the 1950s even, we would make a husband choice on appearance, stability, and personality, but without career choices we were still limited. You, working on a career, are bringing more to the table than those in the 50s. Don't worry about being a virgin, that will come after you know what and who you want for a partner. If they have a problem with it, they may not be right for you. Find your other half and all can fit right, of course there are problems that arise. But with problems, there are solutions. All you need to do is know who you are and what you want.",

They don't have to live with the consequences of your choices. You do. You have to do what will make you happy and comfortable. Don't let anyone  pressure you either. If they're for you, they'll respect your choices and wait with you if that is what you want. And if you don't want to wait, they will be patient as you go at your own pace.\n\nFor reference, I am a 27, soon to be 28, year old virgin that wants to wait til marriage because I want to share that first special moment with my husband. My boyfriend, on the other hand, is very experienced. He is my first boyfriend and first kiss. We started dating last year and we both agreed and we are it for each other.\n\nHe enjoys sex just as much as any other man, but he respects my choices and understands how much it means to me. He does not pressure me in any way and always checks up on me to make sure that I'm okay. Most importantly, he is very patient with me and attentive to my needs. He's also mentioned that he's felt more fulfilled in our relationship than in his previous ones. He fully intends on marrying me as well. \n\nThough neither of us are ready for that step yet, I recognized the importance of intimacy in a relationship from day one so I made the effort to take baby steps to get comfortable with it and I do what I felt comfortable doing to feel close with my boyfriend. I didn't do this because of him (he also asked me this and stressed not to for him). I did it because i wanted to. My boyfriend finds my lack of experience, curiosity, eagerness, and clumsiness cute, endearing, fun, funny and  sexy.  \n\nSo trust me when I say don't change to fit someone else's mold. Do you and find comfort and confidence in your own sexuality at your own pace. Your person will love you all the more for your confidence.",

Because if both are young and inexperienced, the first time usually is a mess. Even if you had no experience, you have grown as a person. You can find someone who values you and who will hopefully make the first time a good experience.\n\nJudging by the many posts complaining about nowadays dating and studies showing that the top 10% looks wise get 90% of the dates, you might focus on meeting same minded people in RL instead. Or at least an app with personality matching.\n\nUnless you just want to hook up for now. But you might get a better experience if you hire a professional for the first time  if you just want to get \"rid of it\" to remove insecurities. But it is a beautiful thing to have your first time with someone you love. \n\nThe older we get the more we understand that there is much more to a happy relationship than just looks and sex. Compromise, both sides putting effort to the relationship, mastering the problems life throws in our way together, good communication and preferably similar interests just as example.\n\nThere is no reason to feel insecure. And you will understand from the reaction of the men you get romantically involved with in the future. You are actually a rare gem and most men will value this.",

I don\u2019t regret it, but I also don\u2019t see it as a major accomplishment.\n\nIf you\u2019re a woman, finding a decent man is important. It\u2019s okay to have standards, it\u2019s okay to be selective, and it\u2019s okay to not give sex easily.\n\nMost guys don\u2019t respect women who have sex easily because it signals a woman who doesn\u2019t value themselves highly. It also could signal a woman with a lack of impulse control. Most guys actively try to get laid, most women try to make it a challenge to get laid with them. I\u2019m not impressed by guys who are players, and I\u2019m not impressed by women who sleep with a lot of men.\n\nTo me, sex symbolizes way more than just recreation, it signals commitment, a milestone, and a long term romance. \n\nKeep in mind, I\u2019m not a puritan. I believe in freedom, and people are free to be as promiscuous as they want. I just prefer people who don\u2019t sleep around non stop. That is my preference. \n\nIf you\u2019re serious about having children and becoming a mother, I would recommend seeking out men more who are of good character, and try to figure out finding a man by 30 years old. Obviously work on your character development and bring things to the table that will attract a quality high value male. (I\u2019m not talking self proclaimed alpha males or sexists), I mean a man who\u2019s a gentleman, intelligent, and has a good heart.",

Losing your virginity, in a somewhat more modern vision, is the concept of breaking the ultimate barrier of intimacy with another individual. To break that barrier you need mutual desire, compatibility, consent and a plethora of other things, it isn\u2019t just penetration. Does a woman who only has sex with other women during her entire life die a virgin? Of course not. Also, you are not weird for not having found the adequate partner yet, each individual achieves life\u2019s milestones at their own pace by taking different paths, which in the majority of cases are neither more wrong or right than other paths just different choices. Catholic priests for example pursue celibacy during their entire lifetime for their own religious reasons, are they losers for this? Of course not.\n\nAbout your views in regard to sex: each individual is entitled to have its own views and set of values (moral or rational) and has the right to act accordingly both individually and as a member of society. (As long as it doesn\u2019t hurt other obviously). This is the long form of \u201cyou do you\u201d :)).",

Like, Sex is (should be) something you do to have fun, not to feel pressured about. If you want to do it go for it, but if you aren\u2019t ready or feel like you don\u2019t want to do it, then don\u2019t! \nThere\u2019s nothing worse than pressuring yourself to do something you\u2019re not ready for.",

Up until college, I was extremely shy and lacked confidence. I still lack a bit of confidence but it has considerably improved. \n\nI understand that it feels bad, especially when you look at all your friends and they're dating someone or getting married. But that's alright. Everyone has their own pace. You don't have to subject yourself to the timelines set by society if you are not comfortable with it. \n\nI would also ask you to ask yourself whether you want to be with someone. And if so, is it because you think you are ready, or simply because you think you are missing out on something. It took me a while to realise the answer to this question.\n\nI am unsure how helpful this comment is, but I hope it at least puts you a bit at ease. good luck :)",

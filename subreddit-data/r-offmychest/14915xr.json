    "postText": "I need to went out, because I\u2019m sure as hell don\u2019t want to do this at my job, so here I go with a story time. \n\nI live in an apartment, where we have several flats on different floors. It\u2019s not really a problem most of a time, we are used to living here. Anyway, yesterday I was returning home from my workplace, and I\u2019m not going to stop here, since it doesn\u2019t really matter, the only important part is that I was extremely stressed out due to a difficult situation. \n\nWhen I was on a floor, I came to my door, and it is when I heard a dog\u2019s barking. You see, our neighbors have a Doberman Pincher, and my whole family is prone to be scared of dogs. When I heard barking, even though it was behind the door, I was stressed, so I shouted \u2018Shut up, scum\u2019, since there was no one around and it felt appropriate. \n\nForgetting it in a second, I entered my flat and closed a door. It is when I heard a knock on my door; it was our neighbor, who was shouting \u2018Who is the scum?! Come here!\u2019 My first instinct was to ignore this as I realized that in my fucked up state I\u2019ll just make it worse. The problem started when the neighbor has kicked our door and said \u2018Come here!\u2019 one more time. At that point I thought about the fact that I live with my family, and I didn\u2019t want them to pay for my actions and meeting an angry neighbor, so I decided to open the door and clear the air. \n\nWhat happened next was completely unexpected. \n\nShe was standing before me with a knife in her left hand, her eyes were gauging out of the sockets and she menacingly asked \u2018Who is the scum?\u2019\n\n\u2018The dog\u2019, I answered sternly, looking in her eyes, thousand thoughts in my head. \n\n\u2018Who is the scum?\u2019 she repeated, so I guessed she didn\u2019t get the answer she wanted. \n\n\u2018The dog is the scum\u2019, I clarified, eyes still looking straight at her. \n\n\u2018Who is the scum?\u2019 third time. \n\nAt this point I actually got confused and scared, but most importantly felt dumbfounded, because I answered her clearly, didn\u2019t I? In my state of shock it was more important to me to be true to my words rather than give her what she wanted, maybe it\u2019s something I should put on my CV. \n\n\u2018The dog is the scum\u2019, I repeated finally, my voice was actually wavering in its tone, but what completely sold my genuine fear was that this was the first time I actually looked straight at the knife. \n\nDog person as she is, she sniffed my fear professionally and felt herself on top, and being a complete alpha, she decided to stab me critically. Metaphorically, thankfully. \n\n\u2018You say this one more time, I will cut your stomach open\u2019. \n\nAnd I feel like at this point both of us realized that it was actually taking it too far, so I closed the door and she gracefully let me. She then proceeded being the strongly minded individual by texting my mom to pacify me or she \u2018won\u2019t warn her the second time\u2019. \n\nSkipping the part where we went to police to report her and cool chat with neighbors where my mom asked how to report such a thing and the neighbor told everyone to ignore us since we are family of psychos (\u2018drunkards, addicts and autists\u2019 she texted proudly, leaving me to wonder who is a drunkard and addict and also how is our small boy, who is 12 and is on autistic spectrum but completely harmless, made her life so miserable that she needed it to state near such insults), I have only one thing to ponder, which is what the fuck has even happened. But honestly, this is not an excuse not to work so here I am sitting at my desk and thinking thank whatever there is, I have quite a tall order for this week. If only people knew what nerves it takes to plan all the tobacco for their cigarettes and vapes and I\u2019m not even smoking. \n\nTl;dr I shouted at a barking dog behind the door and neighbor came to me with a knife to threaten me",

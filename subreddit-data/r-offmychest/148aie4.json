    "postText": "That was the main thing I was looking for in relationships. Not one sided ones, where I am alone in making efforts. I told you that in our very first chats. You knew. And you told me you were different. I made those efforts because I wanted to do so, not to recieve them back. You never heard me bring up about that one time I sang you a song and did your project for you because you had a period, or the countless nights I stayed up late to talk to you despite me waking up at 5 in the morning. Or all the things I did for you back then, I never bought up any of it, since even now I don't regret them. I honestly don't. Since they validate me in saying that I did all I can.\n\nI love reciprocity. And I told you that. Sure you made small little efforts, though not as heavy as mine. Yet I was estatic to recieve them. I thought to myself, \"This was it. This was what I was looking for.\" It wasn't. The feelings of anxiousness and insecurity piled up little by little, without it being addressed no matter how much I bring up these feelings. \n\nRemember that day in May? It was the day before my birthday. Yet that night you told me you would like to sleep early since you had to be at school early. Early as in 8am. I felt a hole opening up in my stomach. I stay up till 2am and wake up 5am to talk to you when you can afford to sleep in. But I said sure. Goodnight. The clock hits midnight. You sent me a message. I can't explain how glad I was when I received that. Sure it wasn't that long, but you greeted me happy birthday! The sleeping early thing was a joke! It was not. It was a scheduled message. I'm not even worth wasting a few hours of sleep on. I loved reciprocity, and I told you. And you told me you were different. But I see I was taken for granted. \n\nI can't talk to you about how I feel since I don't want to disturb your peace as I don't want to disturb mine. After a few weeks of processing I feel better, and compared to other posts in this sub or even other experiences in real life, thi just feels small. This feels insignificant. I agree. I might even delete this post later when the relapse stops. I guess this just made me learn to not have any expectations after all, and not lie to myself when I say it doesn't bother me. Thanks for the lesson I guess.",

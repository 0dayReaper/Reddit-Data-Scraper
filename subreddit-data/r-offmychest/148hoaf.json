    "postText": "\nIt\u2019s interesting how synapses work, and it\u2019s more interesting how much we don\u2019t know about the brain. Our first love leaves a pretty great impression on our neural networks, one I imagine I have left alive for long past its due date. After all these years, I still find a small desire for you, a semblance of love. I know we are different people now, and our time has certainly passed; we were just children. But the memory of the boy you were is embedded in certain places and songs til this day. Something by the Beatles came on the radio a couple of weeks ago, a flash food of memories passed through. It\u2019s a fantasy, for sure, but one I cherish deeply. I do hope things are going wonderful for you, and I was happy to hear your grandmother and sister are still in good health. I wish you a prosperous future, one full of love and happiness.",

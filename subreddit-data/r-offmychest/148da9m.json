    "postText": "Sorry its so long \n\nI was 13 he was 16. I'm aware of the age gap. But I was in love. So so stupid in love. I'd like to think for awhile he was too. Doesn't make what he did ok though. We were close friends before we started dating. We kept the relationship a secret. He was my first love. Looking back I should have known but I didn't. He had me on his lap. We were kissing and then his hands were just there. He asked if I wanted it but I said no I'm ok. I don't know if he didn't  hear me or choose not too. I don't think either way would make me feel better. What he did technically wasn't rape. It still tore me in half. It's been so long and I haven't been able to put myself together again. The worst part was I just sat there and took it. I didn't even try to fight it . I was in shock. They never teach you what to do if the person is someone you love. Afterwards I just blocked it out. I didn't know what to do   and I couldn't tell anyone. I did the coward thing and just blocked it out and kept dating him. I willed it to go away and pretended so dam hard that I was ok. He called it off a couple months later. Only then did I let myself feel it. I cried and cried and cried till my nose bleed and my eyes stung. I have had issues before but not like this. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't think. Somedays I couldn't get out of bed.  And I cried. Alot. Ik my story isnt as violent as others but I am in pieces . I am always grieving the part of me that died on his fingers. Always grieving. I feel like a shell of a person. Two weeks after we stopped dating he kissed a mutual friend he talked to while we were together .  I was the other woman . All that pain and I was the other woman.  It has been along while since it all. I am still so sad. I still cry . I am so pathetic. I have not dated since. Enter them. They are this sunshine person. Warm and gentle and caring. We always were friends  but we talk more now. They may be the loveliest person I know. They are an insane musician a kind friend and always greet me with a hug. We have opened up to each other quite a bit. I told him what happened. He is understanding and is always there if I need someone. Always. They know what happened to me and still look at me like I don't have a crime scene for a body. They are the best friend I could ever want. I hate that I have started to feel romantically towards them. I just think they are just so so  lovely.  But at the same time I am still not ready to feel that way towards anyone. Let alone date them. And I may be imagining it but I think they feel like I do. I am not ready but at the same time I have never been more ready. I am so lost. ",

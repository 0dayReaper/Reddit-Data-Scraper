    "postText": "I have been thinking, and I realized that if I were to enter an abusive relationship I'm not sure I'd leave. I'm not sure I'd be able to. I realized that so long as they said they loved me, I'd probably stick with them even if they hit or kicked or insulted or raped me. Just so long as they said they loved me. \n\nAnd I know it's not good. But even a non-romantic relationship I'm not sure I could manage to leave because I'm so desperate for affection and attention as long as they spent time with me and didn't ignore me, then no matter how negative the time we spent together was if they ever feigned interest or love, and said they loved me at all, I'm not sure I'd ever be able to leave. \n\nSo I'd probably be able to leave some types of abusive relationships, but if they were nice even sometimes, I don't think I ever would and once I realized that it scared me and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. But, at the same time, part of me would happily go into one now so long as they said the loved me and gave me a hug at least once a day, maybe even a week, and I'd put up with just about any level of abuse for that.",

            "comment": "Kind of sound like a prime victim for someone with narcissistic tendencies. But at least your honest with yourself. Having experienced shitty relationships and in a shitty one currently not even gonna lie and say that I'm able to do it either. I have yes, but I'm honestly more disappointed in myself for it happening again and then allowing it to continue once I realize it. I can say that I will never tolerate physical abuse at all, due to previous experience that I allowed to go on far longer than I should have. If you can't tell I can easily see why and how it happens.  It sucks to just want to be loved really.",

I think I'm gonna have to be really careful to avoid entering a relationship like that, cause once I'm in, I don't think I'd ever leave. But honestly, for me at least, physical pain is significantly preferable to the emotional agony of isolation. Hence my issues with self harm, lol. But yeah, it really does suck to want to be loved. \n   And sorry to hear you understand. And thanks for listening, and talking, definitely helped me understand what it is I'm feeling better and I appreciate it.",

            "comment": "Would you consider therapy and maybe looking into bpd? Does this tend to happen (even in non-romantic situations) with one particular individual that you get attached to or can it be multiple at once? BPD has this thing called a favorite person, which essentially can be a case where no matter what this individual does you will place them on a pedestal and borderline become co-dependent on them. This paired with extreme mood swings, self harm, destructive behavior, intense fear of abandonment/isolation, etc etc. Honestly one of the biggest steps is being self aware as it increases your chances of avoiding dangerous situations/creates room to grow and it seems you have that down! Truly wish you the best op and may u get to be with someone who treats you nothing less than amazing!!!",

                    "comment": "I was not aware those were symptoms of BPD, but a lot of those do sound remarkably similar. I have considered therapy, but its not always the easiest financially for my family to do, as living where I do, the nearest therapist covered by our insurance is almost 2 and a half hours, meaning my family either can pay money they don't have, or spend time they don't have.\n\nI am absolutely terrified of isolation from anyone, though now that I think about it, I do tend to fixate on one person sometimes and have to remind myself to give them space because they may not feel the same, with both romantic and platonic relationships.",

            "comment": "Sounds like you might *potentially* have some serious borderline and histrionic traits. You may need to get a psych eval to test for a Cluster B personality disorder. Cluster B means you are emotionally unstable. I had therapy for traits for unspecified personality disorder due to having many Cluster B traits. \n\nBorderline= fear of abandonment; masochism; choosing partners poorly; willing to stir the pot; self sabotaging behaviors, inappropriate anger\n\nHistrionic= attention seeking, even if its negative attention; Provocative dress/ behaviors; impulsivity; manipulative behaviors; lacks empathy; rapid mood swings; charming, flirtatious; dramatic\n\nYou certainly have low self esteem. \n\nYou may have been neglected, whether you know it or not. \n\nYou sound so much like me when I was young. I remember I used to pray for bad things to happen to me just to save other weaker people from suffering. It is a fucked up personality disorder that causes this. Its not your fault either. You dont control how your personality develops. The traits start early in life. \n\nGo see a psychiatrist asap. Trust me. You do NOT want that life..",

Especially considering everyone's natural inability to accurately assess their own mental state due to natural biases and blindspots, lol. So I'll definitely try to get it checked out. Thanks nice internet person.",

                            "comment": "I didnt have a CLUE that I could have possibly had a personality disorder. I went to see a counselor for sexual trauma that made me cry over a pap smear.. 8 weeks later, and a very honest psych eval, which they tell you how to answer questions, basically what questions it asks are fairly common, or just things that repeat as how you roll..  and I had my answer. \n\nMy psychiatrist prescriber said she didnt think I had a personality disorder at all. She said you can have a false positive from taking a psych eval during a high stress time and that was a high stress time for me for sure. \n\nBut I have come to terms with the diagnosis and am fairly sure I have worked through enough to get rid of most of the maladaptive traits. Or whatever they were. \n\nThe clinician thought I was going to be mostly masochistic (that was how she described my borderline traits. She never even used the word borderline, which I find strange. She said I had mostly histrionic traits, and was less masochistic than she thought. Masochistic traits have never been a category in the DSM so idk wtf she is smokin, tbh) so anywayssss..  \n\nI did find an older outdated and nil disorder called Self Defeating Personality Disorder that seemed to be a good fit. I guess they took it out because just the name is kindof a self esteem killer, itself. But an interesting 6 year journey, no less. \n\nIjs. If you are feeling reasonably okay and normal about life, ita a good time to take an eval. :-) \nIt really cant hurt.",

    "postText": "My 79 year old mom fell, and has been in a hospital (and most recently) a nursing physical therapy place for 50+ days. I've visited around 40 of those, and am being made to feel guilty for the rest.\n\nJust less than 10 years ago my mom made a very violent suicide attempt. She deeply cut both sides of her neck and stabbed herself multiple times with a knife.\n\nWe don't come from a troubled family where anything like this was expected.\n\nI'm mad that I feel guilty about not visiting mom every single day. She's probably on her deathbed. \n\nTwo fractures in her sacrum, one in her tailbone, and four more in her pelvis.\n\nAs I was typing this, four more messages from my dad (80 years old) and sister requiring assistance. It's round-the-clock so bad that I turned off notifications.\n\nIt's like if we frantically blah blah, everything will be better. My anxiety can't take it so I'm ignoring everything.\n\nHer suicide attempt doesn't help things. I guess the real \"off my chest\" is I hate mom because of that. It derailed my life.",

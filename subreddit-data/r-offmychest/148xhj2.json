    "postText": "im not gonna use a throwaway. but i barely use this account so here it goes. gonna be a long one so buckle up. \n\ni (18f) broke up with my ex (19m) back around November of 2022. we dated for around a year and a half. the breakup was hard because we were both on our first semesters a college. my depression got super bad and he was very dependent on me and it made me feel much worse. We were literally each others first everything. I was convinced he was my soulmate. \n\nI broke up with him and from december-january we had weird moments of communication but it ultimately ended with me breaking contact first. \nJanuary was hard because i was trying to relearn to love myself and be alone. I missed someone being there for me, especially since my ex and i had a really good relationship for the most part. I thought of him as very kind and compassionate. \n\nMy ex and I share a mutual friend ill call M(19f) I met M through my ex but i would say we are way closer than she is with my ex. Shes my best friend. Her birthday was recently and we went on a weekend to the beach at the end of May 2023. it was originally supposed to be me, M, M\u2019s boyfriend, my ex, and another friend. I was ok with it because i no longer have feelings for him and I could be cordial for the time being since I love M. \n\nDuring the months before the trip I was still battling my depression and burnout. Its been hard, I dropped out of my major and I had altogether lost my passions and motivation. I was on the phone venting and sobbing my eyes out to M from stress. She told me since we were talking about bad things she might as well tell me my ex was bringing his new girlfriend to the trip, ill call her S. M had never met S and my ex really wanted her to go. Not only that, the other friend ended up not being able to go. So it was gonna be me fifth wheeling the entire time. \n\nWe ended up getting another friend ill call W to come to the party so I wouldnt have to fifth wheel\n\nI began sort of cleaning myself up, I felt better about myself and was starting to regain pieces of myself before the trip. I became more at ease with the situation. \n\nthe schedule looked like this: the first day would be me, M, her bf, and W. the second day my ex would show up with his gf. then another mutual friend would come the day of her birthday (third day). \n\nthe first day, when I was about to go pick up W to drive us down. She had an emergency and could not go. Naturally, I was sort of freaking out because i did not want to fifth wheel. Oh and guess what. someone hit my fucking car on the first day of the trip too. I was already stressed out because of the accident, but I had hope the trip would be better (boy was that wrong). \n\nthe hotel room was 2 bedrooms with a common area that had a pullout couch. M let me have the other bedroom because I was there first and it was probably for the best I got my own space to hide away in case I got stressed out. \n\nThe second day came and my ex showed up with his new girlfriend. They were all over each other. It made me really uncomfortable because I was the fifth wheel. S did not talk to M at all. in fact if i was anywhere near M, my ex and S would not even go over to talk to her. They were in their own world the entire time. I thought it was really rude since it was literally M\u2019s birthday. and if anything I was the uncomfortable one because I had to watch them be all over each other and it was weird considering our history that he was actively all over her. I get it, they like each other, and im really happy for them. but time and place? if that makes sense. i could be completely crazy but i felt so out of place. i felt like they didnt even care about M, just each other, and that seemed super selfish to me. \n\nthat night, we all got sort of drunk. I think my ex was probably the drunkest. We all go to bed around 11:30 pm. My ex and S are sleeping in the living room on the pullout couch. \n\nI realize around 11:50 or so I left my headphones in the common area. so I do my best to sneak out. I thought maybe they had passed out drunk or were still getting ready for bed. I do my best to be sort of loud when leaving my room. I walk out to grab my headphones and I see it. \n\nHes fucking her on the pullout couch IN THE COMMON AREA. His bare ass was out and he was literally balls deep, mid action. Since I was a little buzzed i had a weird \u201cis this real life\u201d moment. part of me wanted to go \u201cwhat the fuck are you doing,\u201d but i grabbed my headphones and i know my ex saw me because he flinched so fucking hard. i didnt say a word. i just rushed into my room and closed my door. \n\nI could not sleep. I had a terrible ass panic attack. and now typing this out I am shaking. \n\nThe morning was weird. M came into my room and I told her what happened. My ex had already told her. I literally burst into tears. I felt disgusting. I still feel disgusting. We didnt speak about it. In fact they continued being super PDA. \n\nWhen the other friend came I literally clung to them the entire time. I felt so alone and I was not having fun anymore. I called my mom multiple times crying about how I wanted to go home. How i felt like hes doing all this on purpose. \n\nI used to think of him as the sweetest person on the planet, even after the breakup and the no contact i wished him the best. But i feel like what he did was so fucking mean. I was visibly uncomfortable the entire trip and he didnt even tone it down. I even asked M to tell them to tone it down because given our history he should respect that I may be uncomfortable seeing all that. especially after what happened on the couch. they were still constantly flirting with each other, over the top. He was using petnames and it made me feel so weird. \n\nThe trip ended and I was so glad to be able to never speak to him again. I blocked him and her on everything. \n\nDuring the trip I felt all my progress and self love drain from my body. I was a shell and a mess the entire time because i felt like he was doing it all on purpose. \n\nI need advice, i need someone to tell me if im crazy for feeling like this. the only reason im posting this is because i need to get this weight off my chest. because i keep getting flashbacks of that night. hes starting appearing in my fucking dreams and i wake up feeling disgusting. \n\nif for some reason he comes across this post hell know its about him. i dont want to ever contact him again. i told M if shes ever going to have a get together again I will not come if he is there. He crossed my boundaries. he made me feel terrible about myself. I dont even know if he feels bad because he didnt even acknowledge it. All in all I hope him and S are happy together, they are cute and i do think they fit together well. but I hope i never hear about him or his life again.",

            "comment": "So, first and foremost your feelings are valid. You are not crazy. What you are is in panic mode and are lying to yourself in the hopes you feel better because of it. But all thats doing is delaying actual healing and moving on. \n\nYou are clearly not happy for them, do not think they are perfect together or cute together, etc. AND THATS OK. THATS NORMAL. \n\nGood on you for blocking. Don't pretend like everything is fine and go on a trip with him ever again. Cut him out of your life and take it one day at a time. You won't be sad forever. Within 3 months you are going to be flirting with a new cutie and your ex will be a distant memory. He is dealing with his feelings via over compensating and rebounding. He will carry his hurt into his future relationships. Don't do the same. Believe in yourself, your feelings, and your future. Heal, as slow as you need. You got this girlie.\n\nYou got so much fun ahead of you. \n\n-from an old woman (29f), who just went through another break up and is slaying it single. :)",

    "postText": "\n\nI'm 27 and for 10 fucking years I've been the only member of my family continuously trying to get us out of poverty. When I was 17, my mom got addicted to meth. When I was 18, my dad got into a truck accident from his job and got brain damage. I quit going to college at 19 to support them so they wouldn't be homeless and to let my sister (21 at the time)  finish her degree in exchange for her to let me go back to school and finish once she graduated. \n\nWhen she graduated, she told me she never agreed to that plan (lie), so I was stuck with my parents until I could afford to help her pay for half of their bills and my own bills. I had a bf who I got married to at 21 and half the time we were living with my parents he wasn't working but was cheating on me. My mom got sober when I was 21 because I found out I was pregnant and told her she would never see her grandson if she wasn't sober. At 23, my husband left me and I started working 2 jobs. My sister would send money sometimes, but not a lot, and not without letting me know how much of a bind it was putting her in. \n\nWhen I was 24 I got a job in a good field and things seemed to be looking up. I was getting paid more, my sister was helping more, my parents were doing better. Until my sister decided to move halfway across the country to an area with a significantly higher cost of living and essentially abandoned me with our parents again. \n\nI got a better job earlier this year with a new company, my sister's marriage ended, and she's a raging alcoholic now. She moved back in with my parents, she no longer has a job, and just recently got a DUI. I still pay for my parents and now I'm paying for her too. I can't afford to support this many people. I feel like I'm the only one trying to make things better. I know logically I should cut them all off, but I don't think my conscience will allow me to let them be homeless, which they all would without my help. \nI feel like I'm drowning and half the time I think about how much better it would be if I was dead. The only thing that makes me push harder is my perfect son. I would have given up a long time ago without him.. \n\nThank you for reading. I just needed to tell someone outside of my world. \n\nTLDR: I'm the youngest in my family and I'm the only person who doesn't have substance abuse issues and the only one with a steady job. I want to quit.",

            "comment": "I completely understand. Like so completely. My parents made really bad decisions when I was younger and are now disabled and their brains are fried from alcoholism. \n\nI spent last week moving my mother out of her apartment at 11 pm because she was evicted and had to be out at midnight, with the lawn sprinklers on, while my autistic 8 year old sat in my car tearing stuff up. She moved to an even more expensive place she'll probably be getting evicted from soon.\n\nMy dad wrecked his vehicle last weekend. My mom hasn't had a car in years.\n\nThey're always putting me in a predicament. I just wanna run away. \n\nHere's something that may motivate you:\n\nYou cannot continue the generational trauma. You child should no be subjected to this kind of thing. I refuse to let either of my parents live with me, because I'm not going to have it around my son 24/7. Get him away so he can thrive.",

Having said that, bf doesn't have a job as of last week anymore, so I'm extra panicky because now I have our bills and my families bills. My sister wrecked her car in the process of getting her DUI, so I understand that part, too.\n\nI'm so sorry you know what I'm dealing with. I wouldn't wish this life on anyone.",

I moved out right before I turned 18 (my mom was in jail) and I never ever lived with either parent again. \n\nIt sucks the PTSD we have from living lives of poverty. One thing, like losing a job, or car breaking down, triggers your memories and it causes you to spiral. I hate it so much. \n\nI hate to say it, but maybe you should do like my sister and I did. Point them to the nearest community outreach program, and tell them you're broke. You can't pay their bills any longer. You could be putting that in savings for some cushion. I drove my mom to the community action place in town when she got evicted. I didn't mind giving her rides, but I can't foot her rent.",

I'd tell them that you're tapped out, but that since your sister is a college educated adult, she will be taking care of it. You've helped enough.",

    "postText": "I(17f) was dating my ex bf(18m) for almost a year and a half. The first part of the year was wonderful until after our anniversary. After that he kinda started to get a bit insecure (I have guys on my FB) and wanted me to get rid of them. I told him no because either the boys are people in my family or there friends. Me and him got into it and then we had broken up. After a couple days we got back together and everything was fine. Until my mental health was going down and I started to notice. I decided to break things off so I could work on myself and he didn't really like it. He thought that I was being selfish and ridiculous and I tried to explain to him why I didn't think it was a good idea for us to date at the time and he just didn't like it.\n\nSo fast forward to a week later. I had to block him on my socials because of him bothering me. He even messaged my mom and tried to get her to talk to me which didn't work. Then literally a couple days after him reaching out to my mom, me and her were out on a walk and he drove by. He noticed us and parked at his apartment. He then walked over to us and tried to talk to us, my mom didn't handle it and she lost her shit. They both started going off at each other and then he brought up the fact that we had sex. After that my mom turned to me, thinking I was lying to her and she got pissed and walked off, leaving me there on the sidewalk with him. \n\nIt's now a couple days after that incident and I keep thinking about it. I want to make things right but my worry is that whatever I choose, I just feel like I would disappoint someone. And I hate the thought of it. I don't know what to do..I want to give him another chance because I feel like it would work but I just don't want my mom upset. She already told me that he's not allowed on our property, so he's not allowed to come get me, I have until August to figure out what to do..but I'm scared I might make the wrong choice. What should I do?",

You are young, there\u2019s going to be men out there who will treat you better. Your mom is protecting you from making a bad decision, even with her behavior. If anything, she was blindsided knowing how serious it was between you two. But let it be, you\u2019re gonna do better and find better. He\u2019s not worth it. Especially with the blaring red flag of \u201cyou have guy friends and I don\u2019t like that\u201d. Gross.",

He needs to work within himself to resolve that issue, he cant expect you to just fix it. That being said, I think youre better off taking the time to focus on yourself &amp; try to move forward the best you can. Thats my best advice",

    "postText": "My (16M) mom struggles with alcoholism and last night she relapsed again. She had been sober for 5 months after my grandparents gave her an ultimatum that they would try and obtain custody of my sister and I. She was going to AA meetings and stayed away from bars but she left yesterday morning and I didn\u2019t see her the entire day. She wasn\u2019t home by 11pm and I started to get worried so I called my grandfather and told him my mom wasn\u2019t answering my calls. I put my sister (12) to bed and went to my room and around 12:30am my grandfather opened the door and carried my mom to her room. She was at a bar all day and could barely speak. My grandpa put her on the bed and took my sister and I back to his house. My grandma tucked us in and said everything is going to be okay but it\u2019s not going to be okay. My sister came into my room and started crying so I told her to get into the bed and she cried while I held her until she fell asleep. I don\u2019t want to deal with my mom anymore. I don\u2019t want to hear her slurring her words again and think about her drunk driving. I don\u2019t want my mom yelling at my sister or showing up to my football games drunk. I am so scared of living with her. She is not going to get better and I have to accept it. She showed up to my grandparents house today to pick us up but my grandparents wouldn\u2019t let her take us. She got mad and tried grabbing my sister but my grandma kicked her out. I overheard my grandparents talking about gaining custody of my sister and I again and I hope to God they do. I want to feel safe for once. I hope the bar she goes to burns down and doesn\u2019t reopen. I hate that place so much.",

I hope the fresh life you start with your grandparents is peaceful and happy.\n\nIts good you're not thinking of trying to help or fix your mum. Nothing and noone can stop an alcoholic from drinking. Its not your fault and not your responsibility.\n\nI hope this is the rock bottom that allows you one day in the distant future to have a relationship with her.",

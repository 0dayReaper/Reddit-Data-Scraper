    "postText": "Basically what the title says. I 19m have been suffering from panic attacks for as long as I can remember. It's as if everything around me is closing in, my body temperature rises, my heart rate increases, my energy levels drop drastically, my hands and feet tremble uncontrollably and it literally feels like I'm about to die. All while my brain is yelling at me \"nothings wrong just get up!\" But I physically can't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI work as a sous chef and I recently picked up smoking cigarettes but I hate it. You see smoking in general is not new to me as I've been doing weed **sparingly** since I was 16 and that has helped. However I have certain principles for myself where I don't bring weed to work cause I like to my work life and private life separate. I only do it when I'm home alone with nothing to do or hanging with friends. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm fairly new at this job as I only started 2\u00bd months ago but I've already had 2 happen all within the first month. I don't know if I have any formal diagnosis for anything but I do know when I was 7 my school recommended a psychiatrist because I had a hard time settling down and getting along with the other kids in school. I do remember going a few times and then my mother just stopped taking me altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI know it sounds hypocritical to say but I never wanted to smoke nicotine or tobacco I was just gonna stick to weed on the occasion but fuck being out and about is killing me. I don't know what it is that makes me so uncomfortable being around people. I don't know why these panic attacks keep happening. I've tried talking to my mother about it and therapy but she's insisted on me not needing help with anything. Same thing back in primary school I was put into special classes but my mother always took me out cause \"you don't need special treatment. If you can get it done you're fine if not you're just being lazy\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI tried to argue my points but this is the same woman who forever brings up that she's a single mom who raised me with no help and how she finished her degree while pregnant. I can't tell how many times I've heard those stories. Even when I was too sick for school she'd bring it up and say being sick is no excuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can't shake this feeling of being stuck all the time and worrying my time is ticking. Afterwork I'm so exhausted I can't even talk I just wanna be alone. During the day I get that uncomfortable feeling and smoking also helps giving me an excuse to go outside away from everyone and regroup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know upon writing this I didn't think I was gonna say all of this. Apologies if it's too long.",

I still on rare occasions.\nMedication and therapy helped. \nAfter a year I had to stop because of more depressive thoughts. \nBut medication and stopping the nicotine should help with your head and the panic attacks. \nYou aren\u2019t lazy for needing help with that.",

            "comment": "Those aren't habits, those are addictions. You should try to go to therapy to quit addiction, then cure anxiety as well. Get a health card. \n\nAnxious thoughts are future-oriented, things that aren't even likely to exist, self-esteem issues, unresolved trauma, lack of social skills, lack of awareness, fears, paranoias, psychosis, phobias, low self-worth (this is different from self-esteem, I wish to argue) unrealistic thinking (lack of being grounded), etc.. anxious thoughts always have a cause -- that are also, somewhat comes out in form of, panic attacks. \n\nPeople think it's \"impossible\" to get off of those, it's really not. There are actual bad habits rather than addictions, like biting nails, picking out hair, people do consciously and unconsciously, but that thing is chemically handled and processed. That's an addiction.\n\nGWS.",

                    "comment": "I also bite my nails when my thoughts are racing. The reason I say bad habit because I don't smoke cigarettes when I'm home I don't feel the need to. It's only at work when I'm around people and just the noise of everything going on. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know if it's full on anxiety as my aunt who has anxiety describes a different feeling than I do. In my case when it's happening at first I don't know it's happening I just feel exhausted and then I don't know why it happens. My aunt however is able exactly what it is that's making her anxious. She said when she gets an attack she starts crying and breathing becomes difficult. In my case it feels like my body is shutting down completely and death is round the corner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it is addiction I'm not surprised. Addiction runs in both sides of my family",

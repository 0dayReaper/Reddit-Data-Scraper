    "postText": "My brother is 40 years old with the mentality of a 14 year old (he\u2019s much older than me). He works for my parents and not a day goes by that he doesn\u2019t yell at my parents, curse them out, or throw a tantrum. My parents enable his behavior because they feel bad for him and they\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll be \u201cbad parents\u201d if they don\u2019t help him. \n\nHe\u2019s going through a rough divorce and apparently his soon-to-be ex wife racked up a credit card bill and didn\u2019t pay. Collectors are calling my parents cell phones daily, their business daily and now they\u2019re calling me daily too. I got so angry and told my brother but he shrugged it off. He said \u201coh that\u2019s what they do\u201d When my parents found out they were upset, but explained it happens to them too. \n\nSo I lied and told my parents the collectors called old job to get them to actually be pissed at my brother. They\u2019re really angry with him and said they\u2019re finally done with him. Now I feel really horrible and guilty but it feels like it\u2019s enough abuse already. I think I said it to push my parents to see that all of his shitty decisions are spilling over into all our lives. Instead of running around town with his girlfriend and spending money he doesn\u2019t have, he should have paid the $1,700 off to not have my parents harassed by debt collectors. He isn\u2019t even divorced yet and he\u2019s moving in with his new girlfriend already.\n\nUpdate: As of today he paid the $1,700 dollars and apparently gave everyone the silent treatment at work. My parents said it was the first day in months where the day ended without a shit fit from my brother. Progress! My parents also set a boundary that they will no longer give him money outside his regular paycheck. More progress! He officially moves in with his girlfriend of 6 months this weekend even though he\u2019s not divorced yet\u2026what could possibly go wrong? \n\nThanks everyone for the support, I really appreciate you all taking the time to comment :) I\u2019ll keep you all posted!",

If she was as conniving as him, I could see myself doing the same thing to \u201csave\u201d my mom from further abuse. \n\nIs it the best thing to do? Maybe, maybe not. Ultimately, you\u2019re being manipulative to get your parents to do what you think is best. But morality is never black and white. You have to do what you think is best. Sometimes the outcome determines the morality of the choice, and you can\u2019t see a good choice until you\u2019re further away from it. Best of luck - I hope your brother learns accountability.",

It\u2019s the same sort of blind \u201cstep on me please, I\u2019m a doormat\u201d morality that your parents exhibit.\n\nBecause you\u2019re SUPPOSED to perpetually self-sacrifice and allow people to hurt you and the ones you care about while they get off scot-free forever. Let\u2019s say karma is real, whatever \u201cbad karma\u201d you\u2019d have gained from your actions would be made up tenfold by the boon to your parents and if you count yourself amongst the people you care about, you as well.\n\nNow, you know more than I do how it would have gone if you hadn\u2019t told that lie, but honestly, your brother needed a wake up call anyway *even though he might be impervious to those unfortunately*. Sometimes, people need to be made responsible for their way of being, whether this helps him grow or makes him worse is 100% on him. It never should have been your responsibility to deal with this to begin with, whatever happens from here on out isn\u2019t your problem.\n\nToo many people hold superficial, detrimental morality as an unbreakable value, just continue taking the hits again and again because if you don\u2019t there will be retribution, as if there hasn\u2019t been already for you literally doing nothing.\n\nIt\u2019s especially bad with blood, but you\u2019re not a bad person, you did the right thing, because parents do set themselves and their children on fire just to keep one of them warm and it is usually the one who deserves it the least.",

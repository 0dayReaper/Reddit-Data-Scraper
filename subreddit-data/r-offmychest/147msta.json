    "postText": "When we first started dating, I was pretty skinny and I\u2019m tall so I looked even more skinny. He told me I was fine the way I was but I got a boob job and then he told me that I looked horrible before and I looked much better after getting boobs. I also found messages where he kept saying how good Doja cats body was, how he loves short thick girls and big asses. I focussed on going to the gym for my ass and legs and gaining weight, and he encouraged me, saying I looked wayy to skinny before and I look better now. Now that I\u2019ve gained weight and have an ass he\u2019s like \u201cyour stomach sticks out in bras\u201d. I don\u2019t know I can\u2019t win with him, when I was skinny he wanted me thick now I\u2019m thick he thinks I\u2019m too fat. I don\u2019t understand why he doesn\u2019t just leave and get a girl with a bbl since his standards of what can be naturally achieved is so skewed. And it\u2019s not even like I am unattractive I get so much attention, I constantly get told I\u2019m very attractive by both men and women so I don\u2019t understand why he acts like this.",

Trust me I would say to him \"Stop your bullcrap! You are NOT doing all this not from a place of love and care. You are harming her, you stupid man. Take a look at yourself in the mirror and who the hell you think you are to do that to a sweet young lady like her\". Sorry but not sorry he is as bad as a schoolyard bully and I do not like him\n\nOP, you deserve better. So let me ask you those questions and I hope you think carefully:\n\n1. Doesn't it exhaust you that he keeps telling you non-stop your body is not good enough? Gee, he sounds like a broken record that needs fixing\n\n2.  Would a kind and loving boyfriend keep on harping over his gf's body and her physical flaws day in day out? A loving boyfriend would never do such things and what he is doing to you is harmful in the short and long run \n\n3. Would a kind and loving boyfriend love some conditionally based on a person's appearances? Absolutely not \n\n4. I am not sure if you plan to have kids with that bf in the future BUT ponder on this: would you want your bf the possible future father of your possible future kids to constantly bodyshame them to the point it harms them mentally too? \n\nI wish you all the best and you truly deserve better. No matter this shallow Hal of your bf thinks, I believe you a wonderful person who has both inner and outer beauty. What a shame Shallow Hall bf of yours needs an eye checkup for missing out on your inner beauty",

Obviously I was attracted to him, and he had a very charismatic personality that drew people, but he was a big dude and no model.\n\nAnyway, it took me way to long to twig that most or all of it was bullshit. We were at a Costco of all damn places, it was crazy busy, and as we left he was like, \"The cashier was looking me up and down \ud83d\ude09.\" Like, no she was not, she was trying to get through the line and she was probably like 20 years old. She wasn't scoping out your 35-year-old ass with your girlfriend standing beside you. \n\nTurns out, dude was emotionally abusive, super manipulative in other ways, and basically chronically dread-gaming me trying to convince me he had a dozen other options at any given time. He probably did have some other women into him, because he was a love-bomber. But probably not nearly to the extent that he made out.\n\nThat whole tangent to say - do you actually see all these women throwing themselves at him? Or is this something he tells you? And if it happens in front of you, is he flirting like mad and playing it up?",

That Costco moment wasn't completely what did it, but it did make me realize how much of his \"so-and-so is into me\" stuff either existed entirely in his own head, or was a manipulation tactic so I wouldn't get too \"difficult\" - after all, clearly he was such a catch, and could be with anyone he wanted but was *choosing* me (despite all the \"issues\" he insisted I had) - why was I complaining? \n\nLikely, some of those women were into him - because he was charismatic, because he knew how to make you feel like the centre of the universe if he wanted to ... and because he probably wanted some options in his back pocket if/when we finally blew up. I suspect OP's partner had a similar \"blend\" of interest he's making up, interest he's manipulating her with, and interest he's deliberately cultivating against the day she actually leaves. EDIT: I'll also add that guys like my ex... he wasn't poly, but I think he kinda needed to always have multiple women interested in him, on an ego level. I don't think one woman's attention would have been enough for him to feel good about himself. \n\nSome other things happened, and it got to the point where I was honestly repelled by him. I wanted nothing more to do with him. And I never looked back. I haven't regretted it for a second. I just wish I'd done it sooner.\n\nThat was several years ago, and I'm in a far, far better place now \ud83d\udc9c. \n\nOP knows she's miserable around this guy, and happier away from him. She just needs to get to the point of realizing his opinion isn't any kind of \"truth\" and is, frankly, insecure bullshit from an insecure guy who thinks so little of himself that he figures a woman would have to hate herself to stay with him. He's broken OP, not you, and IME, what's probably broken in him isn't something you can fix. Give yourself the love you deserve.",

He refused to believe anything I said and had to fact check everything with his dad.  He wanted me to burn my degrees, and quit my job because it made him feel bad I was more successful. He had no ambition or goals in life and wanted me to put my life on hold while he figured things out. He stressed me out to the point I was going to have a heart attack within 6 months and my hair was falling out. When I finally left, he tried to replace me in my family and kept stalking and harassing me. He said, \u201call of this will stop if you just come back\u201d.

These are the areas that are affected by pregnancy and birth, to cushion our bodies to protect the baby.\nMen are kinda dumb about how bodies work tbh. Boobs are made of fatty tissue, if they want big boobs they need to find a girl whose body has the fat content to distribute up there.

And they constantly express to me that they love just the way I am, and will support me if i want to make a change. However I was so destroyed by my previous partner and what they would say to me that it became ingrained in my relationship with myself and sometimes hurts my current relationship and unlearning the awful things can be hard sometimes. \n\nI cannot tell you what to do, but what I can tell you is this relationship your in, is not healthy. You should be loved inside and out regardless of a number around your waist or on a scale. \n\nTruthfully, I hope you ditch this person and let yourself be you FOR YOU not for anyone else.",

Never let a man make you feel down about yourself and if he can\u2019t enjoy your body then he\u2019s a moron. Go find you someone that will treat your body like a temple.",

His ex-wife, when she was young, looked almost exactly like Sharon Tate; she was STUNNINGLY beautiful. Even when I was young and thin (we met when I was 50), I couldn't even come close. But he thought I was the most beautiful woman in the world. \n\nPlease, don't settle for less than that.",

    "postText": "It's been 5 months since she left. Pretty sure she lied about the reason. I know she didn't love me I just wish she told me before I spent a year and a half of my life falling in love with her. I dont want her back. I dont want her in my life. I want to forget her face and smell so badly but I can't. Its seared into my brain and everytime I'm not occupied it's all I can think of. I'm so tired of this. I want to be happy again but this hurts so fucking bad.",

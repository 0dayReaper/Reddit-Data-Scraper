    "postText": "So today I find out that they should be paying me more. I am an hourly employee and I thought I was lucky considering I was given $2 more per hour than originally offered. Not too long ago I was given a raise of $1.25 for how hard I worked. My boss always tells me that she's really impressed and how I blow the receptionist before me out of the water. I was doing some paperwork and I found out that her pay was $2 higher than I was making and $0.75 more than I currently make. I feel like if I truly am that much better at my job, then I should be making what she made. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also find out an hour after that there is a real possibility that the company I work for could go completely bankrupt by December. I am looking for new jobs already just in case but man today kinda fucking sucks.",

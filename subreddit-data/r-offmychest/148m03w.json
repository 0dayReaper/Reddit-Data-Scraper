    "postText": "Im currently in a battle to get my divorce,child custody and alimony. I have gone through every single abuse that\u2019s written in the books . I\u2019m tired of fighting. I have been fighting to keep myself sane since the day I got married. Some days i just want to end it. End everything. The only thing that\u2019s holding me back is my child. I just got served his lawyer\u2019s notice again stating how good of a person he is, how God fearing good husband he was. I lost my faith in God after living with him. I really regret the day I said yes to him. I want everything to be over so I can finally have peace. For the past 8 years it feels like I am living in hell. I have family and friends who support me now but I feel it difficult to share how I feel because they continuously asks me to be patient, to have faith in God\u2019s plan, not to be weak, think about my child, think about my parents. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m tired of being strong. Tired of trying to be sane. Tired of being alive. I just want cry it out. For once I want someone to hug me and tell me that it\u2019s okay to cry!",

I believe there is light at the end of the tunnel for you. Just keep your eye on it. It\u2019s ok to break down. It\u2019s ok to feel sorry for yourself. Do whatever you need to get through it. Women and mothers are the strongest beings in the world! It is unfair you have to dig for this strength. But it is there and you can do it.",

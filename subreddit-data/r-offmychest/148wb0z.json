    "postText": "\n\nHello everyone, for context I\u2019m F19 and my boyfriend is M22. We actually started texting everyday for a few months now and now we\u2019re dating :) \n\nAt first, our relationship was really smooth-sailing, he would reply my texts really quickly (almost instantly), just was really sweet overall. \n\nHowever, in recent months, I don\u2019t know what got into me but I started overthinking about everything. Whenever he would send texts that were kind of \u201cdry\u201d and I didn\u2019t know how to respond to it at all, I would feel a little hurt because what if he somehow lost interest in me or what if I was annoying him and he\u2019s busy. That kind of thing :/ Obviously I\u2019m aware I\u2019m a huge overthinker and he knows because I clearly told him I overthink.\n\nI also made sure I communicated clearly to him that whenever I\u2019m upset I need his reassurance. Or whenever he\u2019s out with friends and couldn\u2019t reply me, I already told him to at least update me that he\u2019s busy (instead of leaving me hanging and wondering what I did wrong) he agreed and understood this. But somehow I just can\u2019t shake this feeling off. Like the feeling somehow he would just get annoyed with me because I\u2019m somehow who needs reassurance. \n\nWhen I\u2019m venting to him, I feel like he doesn\u2019t understand how to give me the comfort I need at all. Sometimes he would even just say \u201ccalm down\u201d which makes me feel even worse. I told him before that a few simple caring words would really really help me but I still don\u2019t think he knows how to give me reassurance :/ I just hope I don\u2019t put a lot of pressure on him because I\u2019m not asking for much, I genuinely appreciate the small things in our relationship (when he would say \u201cgood morning\u201d or ask whether I have eaten, I love those) And it\u2019ll make me feel horrible if one day he feels drained because of me :(\n\nAlso lately we\u2019ve been talking a little less than usual, I know he had a lot on his plate nowadays and is really busy but I can\u2019t help but miss our old conversations when everything was sunshine and rainbows.\n\nTLDR; I always overthink in our relationship, bf knows I need reassurance but doesn\u2019t know how to give any, worried he might lose interest",

Don\u2019t worry about it to much you are aware of it and are working on it just try to work on yourself and if you find yourself not happy either it\u2019s ok relationships are give and take",

    "postText": "There's honesty and then there's down right being a dick.  The guy is saying he's not attracted to you and that you need to lose more weight. He doesn't even acknowledge the hard work you've already put in by losing 20-30 pounds. That's great you guys care about each other, but why would you want to be with someone who's not attracted to you and is basically saying you're too fat for them.  Do yourself a favor and get out.  It's never going to get better. There are plenty of good men out there who will think your beautiful and will not try to shame you.  I wouldn't waste anymore time.",

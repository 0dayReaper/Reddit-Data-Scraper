    "postText": "As title suggests... \nI have a weakened immune system and I'm prone to flu etc. \nA chap I work with, came to work last Thursday, knowing he had tested positive for covid but decided not to mention it. \nI managed to catch it and tested positive the next day and I'm in utter shit state. \n\nHere begins my frustration. \nMy partner, boss, coworkers and friends seem to think that as the pandemic is over, it's no longer a thing and that I shouldn't pretend like I'm ill. \nI'm constantly dizzy, I can't get a full breath in, I physically can't stop coughing and I can't taste a fucking thing for good measure. \n\nMy partner is clearly upset that I can't get out of bed. \nMy boss is saying that I'm massively out of line for taking time off. \nMy coworkers and friends have openly said they are taking the piss out of me for having 'man flu'. \n\nFucking treat.",

            "comment": "Take 3 covid tests as taking one could be a false negative I find the rule of 3 works with most things. So you are sure sure. Secondly send photographs of your positive tests as evidence and send them to your boss and peers. Thirdly consult your doctor and inform them that you have covid and your employer refuses to acknowledge it and claims you are pulling a fast one to get out of work and see if they can hand you a written doctors note confirming you have covid. Covid may be drastically diluted worldwide now but it doesnt mean it has stopped existing.",

But shame on your employer and peers. Heaven forbid anyone they actually give a shit about including themselves catch it which ironically if you have covid and are forced to work then evidently they will catch it and they wont be laughing then. My fiance had covid really bad back when the pandemic started and nearly died from it but still feels the consequences of it to this day so you have my utmost sympathy everyone I know has had it apart from myself weirdly enough (touching wood as I type this). Good luck I hope you get the help and due diligence that you deserve.",

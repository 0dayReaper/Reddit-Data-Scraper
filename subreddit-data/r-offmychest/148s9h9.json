    "postText": "Throw away because I'm terrified of him finding this. The situation is driving me insane and I honestly need an opinion and to get everything out of my chest.\n\nApologies for writing this much.\n\nI (21F) met my now ex (27M) 4 years ago, and we dated for two months. We met at work, he 'immediately fell in love with me' and would usually hang out with me. He always made his feelings towards me pretty clear, physically and verbally. I didn't trust him at first, as I've had some nasty experiences with men and boys since I was 13. He supported me through my depression and kept asking me to be his girlfriend, which I eventually gave in and said yes.\n\nAs soon as we started dating, he radically changed. From day one he ignored me and would only talk to me to ask lewd shit. No matter how much I told him I am sex-repulsed and to please respect my wishes, he'd say 'No worries, same here.' and tried again the next day.\n\nThis went on until I got enough courage to tell him that I wasn't ready for a relationship (I thought this is how a relationship looks like, and I can't f do it), yada yada yada. Surprisingly, he was okay with that.\n\nHooray! We stayed as friends as I intended, until I noticed him behaving odd three months ago. He suddenly started calling me (spoiler alert: He never called me once when we were dating), always telling me how good his life was, how he was getting paid x3 times more than me, and started telling me that he would 'buy me anything I wanted' even though I said no. He started suggesting me to send him lewd shit again, told me he still loved me (while he has a girlfriend!!!) and talked about 'what I lost because I chickened out'\n\nI tried to ignore this, but last month he apologized to me because he wasn't a good boyfriend and he felt terrible (always talking about him, lol), how he 'didn't want to be my boyfriend because he didn't know how to deal with me' and I (stupid number one) comforted him: 'I wasn't a good girlfriend either, not your fault, no one's perfect!'. I invited him to talk things out so we can end this for good, which he agreed.\n\nBut then he ghosted me for two weeks, and with everything going on in my personal life I couldn't take it anymore. I called him and blew him off, told him that he indeed was a shitty boyfriend, always guilt-tripping me to do things I don't like doing, and a bunch of names. It was terrible, I was terrible, and I'm not proud of it.\n\nNow, our mutual friends (whom I've known since way before meeting him) avoid me at all costs and keep telling me that I was over-reacting and that I hurt him a lot. But the worst part is my boss is his ex-girlfriend, and out of nowhere I don't have a job and it's being nearly impossible to get another one. She's pretty well-known in my niche, and I've heard she's talking about me behind my back.\n\nI love this job, I love my friends. But except a few, everyone else left. I don't blame them for doing so. Still, I feel so shitty and lonely and those two things were the only reasons I kept trying to improve myself everyday. I need to start job hunting next month and I don't even have the strength to do so, and I don't think I will for a while. I'm so dumb\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you read everything, thank you from the bottom of my heart.",

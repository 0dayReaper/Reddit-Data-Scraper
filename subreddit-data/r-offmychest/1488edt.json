    "postText": "Okay so there\u2019s this girl I met at the library who\u2019s volunteering for school, and I\u2019m also volunteering there for school and I\u2019ve just had this massive ass crush on her for months now. Socially, I\u2019m the equivalent to a brick wall; I\u2019m awkward I don\u2019t say much im shy, and I\u2019ve never asked out a girl in my life. I\u2019m such a total loser that I\u2019ve never even talked to this girl but I just can\u2019t help liking her so much. She\u2019s really cute and im way out her league. im chubby and I have glasses, she\u2019s slim but not skinny. she\u2019s got all the things I love in a girl; long black hair, small frame, light, clear skin, Latina like me, humorous a bit, a little social; she\u2019s my ideal type basically. I was wondering how I should go about this because I stopped volunteering at the library in around late April-early may, and it\u2019s mid June and I doubt she\u2019s still volunteering, i fee like I lost my chance again, but I still have hope that she might still be there. She usually volunteers with two of her friends, but I\u2019m just no nervous to go back to the library after so long. I\u2019ll do it tho cuz it\u2019s summer, perfect time summer break, but I don\u2019t know if I should just ask her out or not.\nIt\u2019s not like anything that bad could happen, the worst outcome is she says no and I never visit the library again, but who knows right.",

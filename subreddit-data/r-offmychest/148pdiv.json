    "postText": "When I was F16 I started dating a guy M15 that lived in my neighborhood. Our parents were friends and even encouraged us to start a relationship before it\u2019d began. After we started dating they were still equally ecstatic, we often went on dates alone, family dates with his family or with mine, or both of our families would all go out together to do something. Then after a couple of months the idea to have a sleepover was mentioned (I don\u2019t remember who\u2019s idea it was) but his mom AGREED and even pushed my mom to agree as well. After this night, it got weird. She often talked about his *parts* in front of me and would ask questions like \u201care you guys having sex?\u201d \u201cI heard a little something in the living room last night, could that have been the two of you?\u201d Always insinuating that we were having sex. Then it got so weird that she scheduled him a fertility test at 16 because she was determined there was something wrong with him and he was \u201cinfertile\u201d. Well he refused to do the test and in her eyes this meant we were sexually active. Things continued to get weird and he eventually told me he thought his parents were going to make us break up. Together we coined the idea to have a baby. (Bad idea looking back, but what can I say. We were 16 and in love.) One night I had to go to the ER and his mom used this against him and made it seem worse than it was and he admitted to her that we were sexually active and she later found out we were trying to have a baby. All in all they did decide we needed to stop seeing each other and they took away his electronic devices, bought a house out of the neighborhood (like 20 or so minutes away.) and my parents sent me 16 hours away to live with my grandparents. Love always finds a way though, right? We kept in contact when we could (infrequently but I took what I could get) until April of that year. I was drugged and raped by someone I\u2019d met 24 hours prior, and in my still drugged state I began calling him erratically freaking out. His mom caught wind of what was going on and sent him away to another family member and we never spoke again. I let it go and dealt with my own trauma. But now 6 years later I\u2019ve started having dreams about him. I\u2019m now a mom of two (I never got pregnant with his baby) with my soon to be husband in a new state as well. Why now, 6 years later? We just bought a house, a nice car, we have two beautiful kids. So why can\u2019t I stop dreaming about him? \n\n(I actually texted him two weeks ago and he responded. It was closure and it was good and he was still so kind. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m posting this but it feels so good to talk about. Sorry this was a long read)",

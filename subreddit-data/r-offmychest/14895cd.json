    "postText": "I don\u2019t know if this would be the right subreddit but I\u2019ll just share it here.\n\nDisclaimer: this is also my first time sharing something on reddit so bare with my writing and choice of vocab.\n\nIn my dream, I\u2019m on a transportation vehicle and there was an advisory for the incoming typhoon. It was raining then suddenly my phone rang. Apparently i have two phones in my pocket, and they both rang at the same time. I thought it was just an alarm but it was a number \u201c232\u201d and when I answered one of it. A man spoke, sounded like with an indian/pakistani accent i think and said please press \u201c2322\u201d or \u201cdial 2322\u201d and he said something else but I vaguely remember it. Then i just replied \u201cokay\u201d then after the call, I immediately go to recent calls and blocked the number. As i blocked it, I heard him speak again and say that I shouldn\u2019t block him and just do what he says to press \u201c2322\u201d and that\u2019s when I panicked. I thought I was being monitored and covered the front camera but as soon I tried to press the number, I woke up. \n\nThen I googled it, \u201cwhat does 2322 means?\u201d \nThat\u2019s where I read a couple of articles about it saying the angel number. After reading what the number signifies, it hits me. It all makes sense about my current state in life. In terms of career path, social, and what I want for my future in general.\n\nSo it basically says, \u201cYou are one of those people who are afraid to take risks and make a move to a new beginning. Your guardian angels give you this angel number 2322 to have the courage to make some significant changes.\u201d If you\u2019re curious more what it means you can read more in google. \n\nI know some of you reading this might think I\u2019m insane or what. But I do believe in angel because I had a sister who passed away at a very young age so that\u2019s why. \n\nI just want an advice though if I should follow it because it also says about being true to myself and do not fake my personality. Having said that, this past weeks I\u2019ve been thinking if I should come out to my family as Bi because I\u2019m tired of pretending straight. Yep I\u2019ve come to conclusion I\u2019m Bi, I am romantically attracted to women and get sexually attracted to men. As far as I remember, even when I was a kid, i had a lot of encounter where people around me question my gender identity. That\u2019s when I thought I\u2019m not normal in terms of the gender norms. Although, I feel like my some of family/friends already knew and just waiting for me to open up but I\u2019m kind of afraid they won\u2019t accept me or just see me as gay (which is fine i know). The only thing I\u2019m worried is they\u2019ll treat me differently.\n\nDespite of that, I\u2019m still exploring because I\u2019m inexperienced in terms of relationship or life in general. That\u2019s why I\u2019m still unsure on what to do next. I don\u2019t know if this thing I\u2019m carrying in my chest, is what\u2019s holding me to enjoy life. So I\u2019ll just leave it here.",

    "postText": "so recently a friend from school tested positive and she's been lonely, so I mentioned Minecraft in a convo one day and long story short I gave her my gamertag and we've been playing together for a few days. we don't say much but we call while we play sometimes. yesterday I went afk but we didn't mute, so she started talking to her mom after a minute. I was just by my phone doing something else so I heard. she had a convo that went similar to this:\nmom: who are you playing with?\nfriend: my friend from school, they've been playing mc with me while I'm quarantining\nmom: oh that's sweet, what're they like?\nfriend: they're really nice. we don't say much but they're really funny\nmom: aww, I'm glad someone is keeping you company\nfriend: yeah it really means a lot to me, they're a really good friend\nshortly after that she stopped and I came back, acting like I hadn't heard a thing.\nit really made me happy. I have very few friends and I don't open up a lot, and I was worried I was annoying her. it's nice to hear her say she liked my company, especially not because I asked her or something, she just said it. I've been thinking about it all day. I can't wait until she's better, one day I might try being myself a little more. it made me happy",

So we got him into the team and told him while being on teamspeak.\n\nA minute after that he stormed out of his room screaming\n\n\"MUM MUM I HAVE A CLAN I FINALLY FOUND A CLAN\"\n\n\"Thats great sweetie\"\n\nbut in german.\n\nFour almost grown guys went completely silent, so touched were we. It was just shockingly cute.\n\nBut to your story: I wish people would just straight say it more that someone means a lot to them. I literally only met one person who ever really just said that I was important to her or how happy she was I was there, on a regular basis. It feels like drinking warm milk while freezing and definitely doesnt happen often enough in this world. Well maybe its just me.",

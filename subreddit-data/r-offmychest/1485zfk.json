    "postText": "How about a round of applause. Standing ovation really is deserved. I told you I would push you away and make you hate me. Make you resent me and you said no, never, that will never happen and guess what? It did. I did it. I finally pushed you to quit your job and come home after almost 2 years of being separated. I think moving in with someone really hit that one home. I pushed you away into a different life. Your own, one that I\u2019m not really involved in and it\u2019s so fucking weird but it was for the best I thought. We could both have our own identity and lives and try to figure out who we are and what makes us happy. We were so enmeshed with each other. The one thing that I didn\u2019t anticipate was how I would do it. Who knew that being an alcoholic piece of shit on autopilot would be how it happened, but there are worse ways I guess.\n\nI just didn\u2019t want to feel. I didn\u2019t want to feel your absence. I didn\u2019t want to feel grief. I didn\u2019t want to feel changes. I didn\u2019t want to feel or think or live, really if I\u2019m being honest. I was doing okay being on my own until **** got sick. Then my hysterectomy and then grief. Blinding grief and pain and hormonal changes. I lost my best friend when he died and things from surgery are basically a blur. Almost a month out of work and on so many pills. Add the heavy drinking on top of that - I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I didn\u2019t want to think. I just wanted to survive each day without fucking ending it, and that was hard enough. Is hard enough. \n\nI was spiraling out of control and reaching out to anything I could grab on to. I couldn\u2019t do that to you again and pull you down with me. Things were so dark and I\u2019m so grateful to you being there while I recovered and cried and just broke. I couldn\u2019t keep doing that to you, especially out there where you couldn\u2019t do anything. I know how that story goes and it makes me feel similar to how I do now - like a dark rain cloud full of doom and gloom. So instead I grabbed on to someone else already far out in the water like me, drowning and lost.\n\nI\u2019m lost as a person. My identity is gone. I know some random facts about myself but that\u2019s about it. Are you lost too? Am I even living still? I felt like I was going to take a shot at it all, but I failed. Every choice I\u2019ve made has led to heartbreak. Is this a sign, is it what I deserve, is it just my luck?\n\nI can tell you what my biggest regret in life is up to now - hurting you. The man who loved me with rose colored glasses. The man who would stop at nothing for me. The man who loved and worshipped me and I hurt him. Is being heartbroken worse or breaking a heart. I\u2019d say breaking a heart because you know you\u2019re both hurting.",

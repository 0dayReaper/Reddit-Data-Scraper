    "postText": "\nSo were both early 30s. Been together just under 2 years now. Live together, dog, whole 9 yards. I had left an 8 year relationship before hand.\n\nWhen we started dating on an early date right before our first time having sex, like right before. She goes btw I'm seeing other people, If that's alright. I had surprisingly never come across people multidating before, I thought that was like a TV show thing, sex in the city, bachelor.  I came from a small town. Anyways, I panicked and said yes its fine, and I wish I hadn't of. I should have stood up for my morality and sense of self worth.\n\nAbout 7 months ago on a date with her, we're talking more about those early days, and she tells me she was seeing 5 other guys... at the same time. I was sort of shell shocked. Each guy on a different day, in different locations. She said it so nonchalantly, not like she was admitting, almost like she was bragging.\n\nHere's the thing. She's crazy about me and I was about her. I'm a hopeless romantic, I grew up a nerd, I watched probably too many movies about magic and romance, and my father always thought the world of me and told me I'd find some great love some day. Wishful thinking. So you could say I had expectations that weren't fair. An unreasonable world view. \n\nSo I meet this chick and things go really well. I thought I had come across that unspeakable *thing*, the way they look at you, like there's nothing else in the world and you just click. That was happening in the first month. It took us three months to become 'official' (I hate this notion). This Is people's emotions and feelings and time man, not a court of law.\n\nSo I learn on this later date that she was seeing 5 other guys, and it just breaks me. I haven't asked if they had sex, but one guy she had been on 10-20 dates with apparently, so like... also telling me *right* before sex. I'm daft, but I'm not that daft. And apparently she hates condoms. \n\nThe idea that she would have a great night with me, say lots of special things, we'd share the look, we were talking every hour of every day and have been since. She said I was special. And then going out the next day and the day after and so on, and sleeping with a bunch of guys... \n\nI'm just done. I haven't brought this up to her. I'm probably too gentle for my own good, and I don't want to blame/hurt her, she did kind of tell me, and she wasn't breaking any social rule. It's just awful. I let myself be an option, and not even a good one. I shouldn't be here. One of the guys was a millionaire. They were taller, more handsome, etc. I know the sentiment of \"oh but she picked you\", but it doesn't make me feel confident. If I was truly that good, she would have dated me and stopped fucking other guys, it took 2-3 months, she went on new dates after our first few dates. I didn't win man.\n\nI feel alone, and that's because I am, and I always will be. All my life the most important thing to me was finding someone I could support and love and we could rely on each other. But this is fucking niave. I'm in my 30s, its time to grow up. You look around and basically no one has this. Relationships fail every day, people are fucking each other over at every turn. No one gives a shit anymore. \n\nLove is dead or it never really existed. It's lust. Biological drive to have kids. That's it. \n\nSo now, I'm here and I'm enjoying my hot gf, and she treats me well now, and that's like fine. That's good enough, but I'll make sure to focus on myself instead. And if things ever go wrong then whatever, I'll just go fuck around like everyone else is, and I'll not give my love and care to other people like this. \n\nTl;dr: gf slept around at start of relationship. It makes me feel fucking awful, disrespected, embarrassed. Apparently this Is the norm now. I have lost faith in people and I'm anguished at the thought of never finding someone to trust, but that's life man. Life isn't good or fair.",

    "postText": "This has always been a struggle for me.\n\nI knew when I was a pre-teen that there was something different about me.\n\nI am AFAB but when I was roughly 13, I began questioning that, same for my sexual identity.\nI'm now 21 and I still don't have much of an understanding for my gender.\nI came out as pansexual last year, and I also came out as gendefluid, but yet even that didn't feel right.\n\nAnyone who sees me or knows me IRL knows that I am very hyper feminine, and I like being that way, I used to be scared of my femininity but since embracing it, it has changed my life.\nBut yet, everyone who has ever approached me or talked to me only refers to me as 'she', 'girl', 'woman' etc...\n\nAnd I absolutely fucking hate it when people call me that. \nIt wasn't until recently that I realized how comfortable I was with 'he/him' pronouns, after asking a friend to refer to me as such to see if i did like it.\nAnd I did.\n\nI've honestly given up on trying to be comfortable with my pronouns or to try and tell people that I want to be called anything other than 'she/her' because I know that with the way I dress, the way I'm comfortable, does not match the way i wish to identify whatsoever.\n\nI'm not sure what else to say, so I guess I'll leave it at that. Thanks for reading. \u2661",

Best thing I've been able to do is find friends online who use my correct pronouns. I'll be a girl IRL until the day I die, and even after, but at least online I can feel at home a bit.\n\nYou are valid, my dude.",

    "postText": "I caused a car accident yesterday. No one was hurt luckily. However, I am a teenager and already have extreme anxiety. I had just gotten my Level 3 license a few weeks ago and I was taking a right and thought I had right of way, didn't see the car coming, and hit the back passenger's side. My front left bender was damaged but luckily their car just had a few scratches. We stopped, exchanged information, the police were called, and I got served with a citation, a court date, and might have to take remedial driving classes. I just feel so horrible for causing so much stress on the families involved. \n\nAll people involved are reassuring me that it happens to everyone and at least no one got hurt and I am grateful that no one was injured. They're telling me their stories of being in accidents and it being their fault but I just can't stop beating myself up over what happened. It was a stupid, preventable mistake. Now I feel so guilty for all the stress I put on everyone. I am also so terrified of getting into a car again and am not sure if I trust myself anymore.",

Carrying this frame of reference with you will make you a better and safer driver.  I\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be another accident, but it\u2019ll unlikely be exactly like this.  Almost thirty years on and I\u2019m checking that rear view mirror religiously.",

    "postText": "I just got a new job for the first time in 7 years. My previous boss didn\u2019t give a damn about her employees, laughed in my face and insulted me when I asked for a raise, and never gave me anything to help me be successful.   My new boss pays me more for part time work than the old one did for overtime, I get to pick my own schedule, get weekends off, and most importantly I get respected. I could go on because that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg but I\u2019m not here to brag.    This is an employee\u2019s market. Damn near everywhere is hiring. Your boss needs you, not the other way around. If he/she can\u2019t act accordingly then they aught to work alone until they learn their lesson, go out of business, or both.",

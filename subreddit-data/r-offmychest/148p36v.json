    "postText": "I am completely straight but 4 years ago I had a threesome with a friend and her boyfriend. We were completely drunk and it never happened again. We stayed friends for years me and the girl (let\u2019s call her Alex)and it was really platonic and she was always respectful with me.\n\nI\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for a year now, and before we started dating he wanted to know all of my past before being with me, so I told him everything (I\u2019ve had 3 sexual partners that were my boyfriends and that threesome)\n\nI didn\u2019t really care about his past the only thing I care is who he is now, but he also told me about his past but I learned later on that he lied about some things that he ommitted to say. And he\u2019s had around the same amount of partners. \n\n\nI stopped talking to Alex the girl I had a threesome with because he shamed me a lot about the situation and what I did, saying that it was disgusting to him, that he viewed me as innocent and I ruined that, that now these people viewed me in a disgusting way and I could never change that. He even said \u201cdo you think your mother would be proud\u201d and has called me a s**t in the past (year ago).  He also has slept with around the same amount of people and some were just hookups also. The only difference is he hasn't had a threesome so I find his judgement a bit hypocritical? \n\nToday, one of my friends texted me asking if I wanted to go out with her and Alex (she doesn\u2019t know about the threesome and I\u2019d rather not talk about it to respect Alex and her relationship). I asked my boyfriend what he thought about it because I thought that maybe it was okay if I went since it is a group setting and that I have absolutely no feeling for this person except friendship and we were very platonic friend\u2019s before I was with my boyfriend. He shamed me saying pretty much the same things he did in the past and he said that he is ashamed of me. \n\nI honestly do not need to go, I\u2019d rather him feel comfortable with anything I do, but am I stupid for thinking it would be okay to go with them? Should I have never brought this up and just declined the invitation?  \n\n\nTL;DR : I had a threesome in my past and my boyfriend is ashamed. When I brought up hanging out in a group setting with the girl I had a threesome with he shamed me.",

Then when it was his turn *lied* about his own :\\ it may seem small in this instance but just know it translates to other things too. If he makes a \"mistake\" or does anything he considers \"shameful\" he'll lie/downplay etc. If *you* do something he considers those things he'll actively isolate you from anything to do with it and be bringing them up whenever something happens he'll bring up whatever you did \"wrong\" which imo anyone's sexual past isn't my problem. As long as they're a mentally sound/responsible person when I know them and would tell me about any health concerns/get tested cool otherwise idc to know the specifics unless they feel like sharing it.",

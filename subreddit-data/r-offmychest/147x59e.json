Newsflash: if you return a person back to the same environment that caused their wounds to begin with, they will NOT get better. With even that aside, medicating away all behavior that seems different is honestly a dangerous slippery slope towards shunning a plurality of personalities.\n\nWhen will we start normalizing the fact that everyone has baggage, no one is perfect, and trauma responses are actually normal responses to emotional or physical injury, whether it occurred once or over a repeated time period? We never have anything to say about the people who cause the trauma in the first place. Cruelty is celebrated. \n\nAnyways this is my rant. None of us leave this life unscathed and none of us are normal. Let's stop using mental health and all that comes with it as a crutch. The world is actually run by people who would be considered incredibly  \"abnormal.\" ",

            "comment": "&gt;When will we start normalizing the fact that everyone has baggage, no one is perfect\n\nIsn't that the point of suggesting therapy then? That we can all benefit from someone helping us unpack it and developing better coping mechanisms with an objective and trained professional, since having baggage is so normal?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;trauma responses are actually normal responses to emotional or physical injury, whether it occurred once or over a repeated time period?\n\nWhile having a trauma response *is* normal when you've experienced trauma, it still *isn't normal,* if you understand what I mean. Trauma is notable because it can have such a profoundly negative impact on our lives and it's not supposed to be experienced. That being said, we cannot live in a world without trauma, and therapy mitigates that. And it is especially not normal for trauma to impact people's relationships and day-to-day lives the way that it can. Remember that while trauma responses are common, they're still considered abnormal behaviour. There's also a ton of reasons a person might seek the assistance of a therapist that aren't rooted in trauma, either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We never have anything to say about the people who cause the trauma in the first place. Cruelty is celebrated.\n\nI'm not sure what you've experienced but I have experienced the opposite\u2014you can't lump everything and everyone into one category. While I don't negate your own experiences, there is no one universal experience, nor is this experience static.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;if you return a person back to the same environment that caused their wounds to begin with, they will NOT get better. With even that aside, medicating away all behavior that seems different is honestly a dangerous slippery slope towards shunning a plurality of personalities.\n\nAgain, broad strokes. If therapy doesn't work for you then that's fine, but to assert that it can't help other people and that it's 'dangerous' is in itself a dangerous mindset and ideas like this being perpetuated can prevent people from seeking help when they desperately need it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Let's stop using mental health and all that comes with it as a crutch.\n\nHow is anyone using \"mental health\" (however you are choosing to define that) as a crutch?\"",

I am saying that people should not be so quick to misclassify every behavior that they don't find normal as a mental health diagnosis or as needing professional help. There's a difference between the two. We tend to look at sadness and anger as abnormal and happiness and a calm disposition as normal, and I don't think it's necessarily fair, nor accurate to create this binary.\n\nEdit to address your other edit: what I mean by \"crutch\" is that it seems there is a developing trend of people feeling righteous in recommending therapy as a way to shift the burden of dealing with their loved one's emotional issues to a professional. Again, not saying that therapy can't be helpful, but I am saying that family, friends, and community exist for a reason. So we should be careful to be so quick to tell someone to just go see a therapist because it can feel dismissive. And once again this trend is also borne out of people feeling like every unpleasant behavior that inconveniences them warrants professional help.",

There's a world of difference between the two things you offered up here. You also said \"a dangerous slippery slope towards shunning a plurality of personalities,\" whatever that means.\n\nYou also asserted that people are using mental health as a 'crutch,' which doesn't at all address 'sadness and anger' and you didn't clarify what you mean either.\n\nI am only responding what you put in your original post.",

The point of this entire post is that we need to be careful not to classify every \"weird\" behavior as a need for professional help or a diagnosis.\n\nAgain, I am not disputing the validity of therapy. I am disputing how people are suggesting it as a one size fits all solution for a variety of behaviors that don't actually need treating from a mental health practitioner.\n\nEdit: people need more than just therapy. They need a supportive environment too. I've seen too many instances of people recommending therapy from a place of judgment rather than a place of genuine concern.",

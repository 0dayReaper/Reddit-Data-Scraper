    "postText": "I don\u2019t expect anyone to read this or say anything I\u2019m used to being ignored. \n\nI\u2019m 20 I secured a really good job which means a really prestigious company is paying my wage and degree I thought I\u2019d be happy. I\u2019d finally get financial and some independence I wouldn\u2019t have to beg for bus money or dinner money from my strict parents who were against me working, until I told them I will also be studying.  \n\nMy parents ignore me lately I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot but when I was 13 I went to live with a family member because they were alone. I didn\u2019t get a say in it I just went. It was around a ten minute walk away from my high school but I wasn\u2019t allowed to walk alone, even when a family member suggested I walk with them I was told no. I had to wait for a parent to pick me up and I\u2019d always end up going late. I went to a strict school and would get a lunch time detention for being late so I\u2019d be hungry. I\u2019d also have to stuff my clothes in the bottom of my school bag. I would go back and forth and felt so depressed in this time. I never had a lot of friends I was in a big friendship group but none I was really close to. I wasn\u2019t allowed a phone so I couldn\u2019t keep in contact with anyone. I\u2019m slightly glad about that because no one cared about me in the group I was the spare who helped with homework. I would wake up alone on my birthday and in the mornings as the family member would go to work before I got up and return after I\u2019d finish school so my parents would pick me up. My books and awards and personal things were put in bin liners and placed in the garage for a sibling to have my room even though they had their own. Eventually my parents had another child don\u2019t know why their marriage was failing and i don\u2019t think both of them were entirely faithful. I was only the babysitter when needed. But I wasn\u2019t around and got blamed for not doing anything for Mother\u2019s Day I was a child I had no money and no one involved me. I only moved back home with my parents when Covid happened I also went to a completely different college in another city so I wouldn\u2019t have to see my so called friends. \n\nFast forward to now my parents will go on holiday abroad at least once every two months and im left to cook and look after my younger four siblings the youngest being 3. I have a full time job and I study but I have no motivation. My colleagues are a lot older than me but im not part of the team. Im excluded a meeting was supposed to take place a week ago and everyone had disappeared.  I have no idea where I stand and I feel like I haven\u2019t progressed. I don\u2019t really have anyone I can talk to. \n\nMy parents don\u2019t listen and I don\u2019t do anything bad I never smoked and I don\u2019t drink. I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend or barely spoken to boys. I haven\u2019t seen my two friends since last year and I can\u2019t really speak to them because they have their own issues and I need to give them advice. I\u2019m not trusted which is ridiculous because I never lie and my location is always on. I don\u2019t even go to after work socials despite organising a few because I\u2019m bombarded with phone  calls and texts to come home. Around 75% of my wage goes on the family. I have tried speaking to them, I had a mental breakdown and started crying saying I\u2019m exhausted and the response I got was you barely help around the house and it\u2019s my job to look after my siblings. I just gave up and I\u2019ve become cold and closed off and I don\u2019t think I have love towards them anymore. Moving away for college wasn\u2019t an option because I wasn\u2019t allowed and I wanted this apprenticeship. I\u2019m sick of lying about everything being fine because it\u2019s not.  \n\nI wish I could leave but I can\u2019t my family is really strict I would have to save enough money and go abroad and completely cut everyone off which I plan to do once my siblings are older and I\u2019ve saved money but I honestly don\u2019t know if I want this job anymore. I feel really awkward because I enjoy bits of the work when I actually get something but I just feel like the diversity hire I know I\u2019m constantly used as an example\n\nIf anyone made it this far thanks I just needed a vent but this isn\u2019t everything. I still cry myself to sleep and have been doing for years. I just get verbally abused for anything I say and I don\u2019t like being sad and upset and angry all the time.   Sorry about the bad grammar or spelling I\u2019m exhausted and I\u2019m blurting.",

The people in our lives are supposed to be encouraging and supporting. Is there other family members outside your parents that will help you out? Maybe you could stay with them and get out of that toxicity.",

I can stay with her she\u2019s single struggling mum and has three children so there\u2019s not much space. She and my cousin do try to invite me out every now and again but my parents have a problem with it. It makes my auntie feel weird so she backs off",

It's not your responsibility to raise your siblings and look after them, your parents seem to be super neglectful not just towards you but also towards your siblings. I get how growing up in such environment causes so much underlying trauma for life and becomes a hurdle in one's overall growth and to be born into this is unfair. I am so sorry that you are in this situation, you deserve so much better than this. I hope you fight through it all, move ahead in life and live the life that you deserve. Also, may your parents realise how THEY are the issue and they have been nothing but a failure and a burden in the name of being parents. God bless you.",

I\u2019ll try to keep in contact with my siblings because I care for them but I don\u2019t know what to do right now I\u2019m just existing and praying to god that it gets better",

    "postText": "this happened a few weeks ago and im not over it yet. so i was at home, it was 12am. 2 bottles of two oceans white wine down, and i was waiting on a friend to come pick me up. out of nowhere some girl started screaming \u201ccall 911 my friend overdosed\u201d and so i grabbed my phone, and stumbled to the hallway to see what was happening and then in another guys apartment, there was this boy. well call him nemo. i knew the guy too, he was purple, dead on the floor and there were 2 girls crying and they didnt know what to do. again, i was fucked up, wine its different then other liquor for me. i calmly gave my phone to a girl and told her to call 911 and i got on my knees and started compressions and mouth to mouth. for 2 minutes i kept going and i didnt cry i didnt freak out, its like even the alcohol wore off for the time being. after 2 minutes of giving compressions to his purple corpse he started to wheeze. so i got a pillow under his head and talked to the EMT. they ended up telling me if i hadnt been there he wouldve died. as soon as i got into my friends car i just broke down and started crying. i learned cpr in grade 10 and i never ever ever thought id have to do it. it still scares the shit out of me and honestly i dont know how i did what i did.",

Most people just run around, scream or walk by.\n\nIt doesn't matter that you are scared afterwards - I think thats just the stress relief.\n\nYou safed a life! You're a hero! And you are one of the few people that act when push comes to shove. \n\nGood for you, good for your karma!",

(friends with former paramedics that responded to countless cardiac arrests and various types of ODs)   OP did some damn good CPR for sure",

While she did do CPR, it sounds a lot more like he was in respiratory arrest (as you said) causing cyanosis. Had OP not been there, his heart would've stopped.

Good on you for acting quick. \n\nI came out of an exam once in college. Had to use the bathroom so badly. Bathroom on the floor I was on was closed so started going down the stairs to the other bathroom. Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a dude fall face first out of one of the lounge area couches. I didn\u2019t think anything of it until someone screamed and I noticed he was convulsing. Everyone basically formed a circle and just this dude having a seizure. One of the teachers was yelling and she started calling 911. My grandpa is a doctor and I had to get CPR/AED certified for scuba diving and because my grandpa has heart problems. I ran over shoving people out of the way and started to turn him on his side and making sure he doesn\u2019t hurt himself. He cut his head so lots of blood. I yelled at everyone for just standing around \u201cwhy the fuck are you all just standing there?!?!\u201d Another kid came over to help. When the guy came to he thought we were trying to hurt him and he started throwing punches. He tried to leave but we stalled him long enough that the EMTs arrived and they talked to him. Turns out he had a diabetic seizure. It still haunts me just like this old man that seizures in front of me and bit his tong off.",

Just like you I was totally calm, but after it was over I basically had an existential crisis. Being that close to the edge of life and death was a real blow to my perception of reality. Everyone was so happy for me and I couldn't understand why I felt upset afterwards until years later.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to talk to a therapist. You are not crazy, and you likely don't even *need* the help. It just makes it easier to have someone guide your recovery and that you can articulate feelings to when no one else can relate.\n\nYou did an amazing thing, and it's ok to be upset by an experience like that. It is a trauma, even if it had a happy ending. Feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk to.",

You'd be better off with a shovel.\n\n\nBut every now and then, every once in a while, if the right person is there, with the right training and the stars are aligned, and death is busy having thought he had completed his job, a person can sneak in and cheat him.  Sure they will have to fuck this corpse up, they will have to break ribs, bruise organs, they will literally have to crush this dead heart before them to bring it back to life.  Repeatedly, over and and over and over. It's exhausting, why bother? It rarely works, even with trained professionals, even in hospitals, it simply doesn't work.  \n\nExcept when it does.

Sounds like your actions gave that guy another chance, that's a rare honor. \n\nNot totally related but I'll mention this for anyone that may not know: even if you forget the rate/ratio of chest compressions and rescue breaths - you can still administer CPR and save someones life.  Just keep pushing down on the chest like a heartbeat. and tilt head -&gt; rescue breath every 30 sec or so.",

Just as we we going out from one club (must've been around 3am, completely pissing it down outside) some of our friends start screaming that there's a dead person on the floor who isn't breathing. There was 8 of us there, everybody looking at each other wondering what to do, so I tell my boyfriend to call the ambulance, I get on the floor, check his pulse- no pulse, and started CPR. I was pretty much black out drunk when that happened but I think it helped me to have to confidence to act quickly without thinking.\n\nAfter around 2 minutes he came back too, confused, didn't know what happened and then the ambulance has arrived shortly. They were really nice they thanked and said 'good job' and took over. \n\nWe went to a casino for after party and that's when I broke down crying, I guess the shock just set in about what happened. I got some love of all my friends tho, went out to the smoking area and had one more drink to celebrate our success haha.",

Most if not almost all CPR cases don't come around, even for trained professionals. They drill into us early that CPR isnt like how we think it is, you expect death more than them reviving, and that's okay. I'm so glad that its because you learned CPR in school, because it shows it can save peoples lives. One of the best things you can do now is spread the word and advocate how important it is to teach everyone CPR.",

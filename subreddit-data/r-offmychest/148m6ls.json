    "postText": "Getting ready for the Super Bowl, enjoying tailgating and all the other pre-game festivities ... then the NFL Commissioner calls you and gives you a play-by-play on the last 15 seconds of the last quarter and tells you the winner.\n\nYou hold the winning lotto numbers in your hand, but you can't cash it in just yet ... meanwhile, you can certainly scratch off and play with the other tickets knowing that you're going to lose each time.\n\nThe captain announcing the precise time that your flight will be landing, including the precise weather conditions and the best Uber to catch upon arrival while the plane is on the runway before a 14-hour flight.\n\nWatching a movie preview, seeing all the highlights and having a really good idea as to how the movie will end. You then read reviews after its premiere to confirm.\n\nBeing able to guess accidentally the correct answer to a very complex algebra word problem, but having a difficult time \"showing your work\" to prove how you got there.\n\nDriving a stick-shift vehicle precisely for the very first time fearlessly with minimal effort, yet being so freaked out over riding a bike with training wheels.\n\nAppreciating the beauty of a shooting star after having been tricked by many lights from airplanes flying over.\n\nPurchasing the floor model of the piece of furniture you needed to complete your home, at a discounted price and delivered to your home on your day off from work with a lot of daylight left to enjoy it.\n\nHaving been discouraged after being rejected from the drive-thru position at McDonald's to receive a voicemail informing you of an upcoming interview for your dream job.\n\nHearing an enjoyable song for the very first time and you're able to sing right along without fumbling any of the words.\n\nAfter being stuck behind taillights on the highway in rush-hour traffic, you get off the exit and every light from there until you get home is green.\n\nFinding more fries at the bottom of the bag underneath that thick layer of napkins.\n\nParking your car and making it inside of your home as just the loud thunder hits and the wall of rain pounds on your roof.\n\nRealizing that you'd rather stay awake, because the love that you experience is so much better than your dreams.",

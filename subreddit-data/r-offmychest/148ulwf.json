    "postText": "I know it\u2019s not my problem, my ex had taken me for granted and put in little effort in our relationship which caused me to break up with him after four years. The breakup was really hard on him as he saw me as the love of his life and loved me very deeply. I loved him too, I really did, but I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore, he was holding me and himself back and had worn me down as a person and partner. \n\nHe really realized how much he had lost and how badly he screwed up by taking me for granted and is committed to changing now that we are separate (but we are not getting together in the future and he knows this). \n\nI met someone shortly before I broke up with him (at the time just a friend, no boundaries physical or emotional were crossed before breaking up) who also helped me realize there was better out there for me even just platonically, as I didn\u2019t know there were people who existed like this friend. My ex was insecure about this friend and could tell how well we got along. I started dating this friend shortly after the breakup, and I knew in part that I had to breakup with my ex because I knew there was potential for feelings for this friend. I couldn\u2019t allow those to develop while in a relationship so I knew I had to break up imminently, and it was the push I needed to finally break up after a long time coming.\n\nNow, I\u2019m in a much better relationship and I\u2019m really happy, and very compatible with my current boyfriend. My ex had told me he blocked my now boyfriend on social media before we broke up because he was too insecure and worried about us getting together after the breakup, so I thought he didn\u2019t know we are dating and hadn\u2019t seen us together. but he texted me yesterday that he deactivated his account because he had been looking at now boyfriends posts of us, and it was too painful for him to see us together. Otherwise we haven\u2019t been talking but he wanted me to know he didn\u2019t block me.\n\nAfter learning my ex has seen us together I really feel for him since I still care deeply about him as a person. It\u2019s so painful to know how much pain he is in, it\u2019s hard not to feel responsible and like I have caused this pain. I never wanted to cause him pain and I know this is terrible for him, but I am so much happier with the guy I\u2019m with now at the same time. It\u2019s hard to not feel guilty even though I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I just wish I never was in the position to make the decision which I know hurt him so much, but I knew it was what was best for me and he had put me through so much. I can\u2019t help but imagine how bad it is from my ex\u2019s perspective now. I feel awful for him. I can\u2019t help but think about how happy he was with me and now how much pain he is in. I am so sad, I wish I could just erase the past relationship and relieve his pain. I could never have imagined how badly I would hurt him in the end. I don\u2019t know how to deal with this pain.",

He knows he treated me poorly, he also had cheated on me. My relationship now is not a rebound, nor did I cross any boundaries while with my ex. I broke up with my ex respectfully and we ended on good terms. But go ahead, act like you know better than me who I am and what the situation was. I gained a lot of self respect and self worth recently and gained the confidence to break up with my ex, which I realistically should have done long ago.",

Either way not your problem",

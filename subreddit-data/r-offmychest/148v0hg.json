    "postText": "For context I am 21F, relatively short like 4\u201911 have a baby face you can say and quite petite but nonetheless still an adult (my mom is 4\u20198 it\u2019s literally a genetic thing). I dress appropriately, wear a light amount of makeup just like any other woman, style myself to my age. Now I expect just with how I look to have to continually prove myself just so I can be taken seriously in every aspect of my life whether it be socially, professionally, etc. I know going out entails constant ID checks, second looks, comments about how I barely look 14 let alone 21. But what I am getting sick of is the being treated as a kid even after I\u2019ve proved otherwise. I\u2019ve shown you my VERY real ID, what right do you have to take it away and call me a delinquent just because you have never seen an NJ license. Or constantly question whether someone\u2019s interest in me is pedophilic (as if I am not always thinking the same thing). I understand that this is a blessing in disguise and that when I\u2019m 40 \u201ceveryone will be so jealous\u201d but what fun is that to be honest. I hope to be settled down by then what good is it if I can only really enjoy my 20s when I\u2019m old because by then I\u2019ll look of age. \n\nMy mom suffered a lot of judgement especially when she was pregnant with me even though she was 26. The amount of teen mom comments she would get apparently, the looks from strangers, the questions from the nurses when she was in labor. It\u2019s a life I\u2019m not looking forward to I\u2019m ready to be taken seriously without having to do so much.",

            "comment": "You are not alone. I run into the same problem on a daily basis. When it does not involve scenarios that require IDs, people are always following me around in stores suspicious that I\u2019m lost or a delinquent skipping school. It\u2019s at this point that I stop being polite and start getting serious with the people suspicious of me.\n\nI often ask what the problem is and either: 1) educate the person that size and looks do not always correspond to age.\n\n2) Complain to a manager (when merited)\n\n3) Drop all my items and spend money/do business elsewhere.\n\nWhen I\u2019m given a child\u2019s menu at a restaurant, I wait for the waiter/waitress to leave and walk up to the bar for a drink (lost money for them when all they had to do was politely ask rather than judge). \n\nFor me, this has not gotten much better with age and I\u2019m approaching 40. I don\u2019t consider myself lucky because it\u2019s very much a chore.",

    "postText": "Growing up, my sister and I were always told that if we ever did anything at all with a black man, we would be out if the family entirely. I started forming my own opinions on people around Jr. High school and realized around that time that most of their opinions and views are not correct and decided for myself that I wouldn\u2019t care about any of that. But I decided I\u2019d still try to stay away from dating outside of white men, just because they are my parents and my siblings and I wouldn\u2019t want a potentially temporary relationship ruin that. Well I haven\u2019t been on the best of terms with any of them for about 3 years now, but we are still talking and being friendly but it is difficult, and I know nothing about them anymore. Now I\u2019ve met who I will call R and he is black. It is going wonderfully with R, but I obviously haven\u2019t told anyone about him other than like maybe three friends that know not to say anything. I\u2019m scared that they haven\u2019t changed, or that they wont hear me out. I\u2019m scared that they wont give R a chance to prove all their beliefs as wrong. But at the same time I\u2019m kinda starting to not care a little, I mean it\u2019s not like I meant to fall for him it just kinda happened. Plus I already basically don\u2019t talk to them so there wont be too much of a change if they completely stop talking. I already know they tell false stories to my siblings to make me look like a horrible person so what\u2019s a few more. I guess we will see where this goes, it\u2019s too late turn back now we\u2019ve already kissed",

What are you doing to ensure that those boundaries are respected by your family? If those boundaries are not respected, are you comfortable issuing and maintaining meaningful consequences or minimizing contact with your family? In the future, what would be the protocol around a family? Because it will very obviously be difficult for your family to have a meaningful relationship with children they only see as half worthy of basic respect.\n\nI think that people who have not experienced racism don\u2019t understand just how difficult it is to be around it for someone you care for. And what\u2019s worse is when that person doesn\u2019t have the capability of standing up to the people who they see hurting you because of their own issues with those same people. And in my mind, **it seems quite irresponsible to expose somebody to known racism if you yourself are not comfortable stepping in to defend, because they wouldn\u2019t be experiencing it if not for wanting to please you as a partner.**",

One thing I've learned is that racism is deeply rooted in people's hearts and minds to where some fantasize about harming or doing worse to people of that hated race. And I don't want you to have this mindset that they're going to change their mind, because there's a chance that they won't. Not saying that you do have that mindset. Please don't pressure him to attend family events or anything. And if he says he doesn't want to ever meet your family please respect that. These times are scary for us because people aren't even hiding their racism. If you aren't willing to cut ties with your family to be with him, I suggest ending the relationship. And if you are serious about him, I do suggest doing your research on the dangers of interracial relationships and racism. Too many black men go missing or end up dead due to ignorant people. I'm not trying to scare you or anything but I'm trying to warn you of your situation. I used to be engaged to a white man who lived in a racist town. And lucky for me he respected my wish to not attend any town events because I knew the hearts and minds of the people living there. Let him know your family's beliefs and thoughts and everything that they've said about black people. Let him know your thoughts about your family's racist tactics. Be honest with him. Let him know your background so he can decide if he wants to be involved or not. Do not hide anything. He deserves to know every single thing.",

He is a rational person, able to make his own decisions and able to decide if his likely exposure to this is worth the relationship and also to let her know what his expectations are. Those aren\u2019t explicit socially, they are formed as part of your individual relationship just like any other set of expectations you might have for one another. Assuming all of this for her removes that agency from him, where it rightly belongs.",

My father got a black woman pregnant. His mother told him she didn't want a black grandchild, so he ghosted the mother, and had no contact with the child, my half sister. Even after his parents died, my father never bothered to look for her, or have any relationship with her. He did everything in his power to make sure that neither myself or my brothers got to meet our half sister either. But last year, she found us on the freaking book of faces. Now we have a relationship with our sister and her kids. My father does not. \n\nMoral of the story, you have to make the choice yourself. But I wouldn't assume that your siblings wouldn't figure out for themselves, that racism isn't cool. Whatever your parents say, I'm fairly certain, that if your siblings want to, they'll try to contact you. Give them that option, whether your parents disown you or not. But if you stay with R, and have kids, I wouldn't let your parents near them. Because they will say racist crap, and will treat your kids as lesser, due to the colour of their skin. So choosing this relationship, would also mean choosing your kids 100%. Good luck OP.",

I was disinherited, my credit cards revoked, they took the car they leased for me, stopped paying tuition for law school, and shut off all contacts when I decided to hunker down with my very white partner. If the money and luxury I never earned in the first place are the price of my happiness with her, I am more than willing to \"sully the dynasty\".

That shit hurts. \n\nI never hid any of my boyfriends from my family, and quite literally just told them to suck it up if they didn\u2019t like who I was dating. We didn\u2019t talk for about a year, but I didn\u2019t want to make my partner feel bad over something they cannot control. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m biased, but I don\u2019t think you should date outside of your race if you\u2019re not willing to stand up  for them.

Always make it clear that your partner is your top priority and that you will not tolerate any disrespect. I've seen situations where a person tries to appease racist/nasty family members and their partner ends up resenting them because they feel unwelcome and unprotected. I have taken a zero tolerance stance with my family. It's meant that we are low contact but it also means that my partner and I are very close and we know we have each others backs.

I really wish I was joking about that too, because she really thinks I'd date someone and have a whole relationship (five years) out of spite for her. A week before me and my SO started dating my dad went on a rant about how me and my twin should never date a black man. So being with my SO has pretty much destroyed me and my father's relationship. They're never gonna get over the fact that their grandkids won't look like them. I honestly didn't care from day one. I love this man, and it's my life. I know once I graduate college I'll be thrown out immediately, if my mom didn't force me to college I would've been out the day I turned 18. I know my SO is the reason why and I don't care. Again, it's my life not theirs and at the end of the day I am the one dating him not them lol.",

Failing to support your non-abusive, strong, healthy relationship simply because you\u2019ve chosen a person of colour is conditional love, so they\u2019re not worth your time.",

I'm happy, he treats me the way the way I deserve, and I have experienced love in a way none of you have ever been able to show it because of the hatred you have in your hearts already.\" And then just leave it be. Those that love you and care about your happiness will contact you, those are the ones that never cared about color, just didn't have the balls to stand up and say shit. Dont be one of these that just cuts their family off with no explanation. SHOUT it from the roof tops for the world to hear. If they aren't in the wrong, then they ain't ashamed for the town to know what they are. And when they start throwing Bible verses at you, tell them to read galatians chapter 3. Jesus did away with the laws of Abraham, so that makes that old testament excuse to be racist null and void. Do NOT sink quietly into the shadows though, because that will give them the fuel they need for their fire. Plus, it might be a little cousin needing you to knock the family over the head first. (No, I'm not a religious person. I'm actually having a religious crisis at this time. I just happened to stumble upon a verse in that chapter on a tiktok the other day, and it seems to be an end to the arguments people give for spreading hate.)",

I don\u2019t think anyone gets what it is like for a Blake person to deal with one rabid racist let alone a room full of them. Don\u2019t do that to him. When they tell you they\u2019ve changed or you can see and hear it yourself over an extended period of time, then it might be fair for them to meet. But your boyfriend and family need to agree to it first. No popping over with him hoping they\u2019ll think he\u2019s wonderful because you do. Black people are always expected to take the high road even in a room of racists. There is a threat/concern of potential violence against us that we have to also take into consideration. What if someone decides to fight him? Shoot him? If they assault him when you leave the room briefly? That\u2019s what can happen around racists. You have to decide if you are ready for the potential sacrifice that you may need to make long-term for being in this relationship. And you must also consider potential future resentment of your boyfriend if your family relationship is sacrificed. The two of you need to talk about this and get on the same page. Maybe he\u2019s ok with going into the lion\u2019s den but it\u2019s his choice to make. My point is Black people aren\u2019t here to teach and convert racists. It\u2019s exhausting and impacts our mental health. And it can be dangerous/deadly. You may not see it because it\u2019s your family and think it\u2019s all talk but it might actually end up in action. Just food for thoigt. Good luck to you and the boyfriend.",

Also, racism is never acceptable, for any reason. My advice would be to make sure you are committed and mature in your relationship with this gentleman you\u2019re dating before subjecting him to the pain of having to meet your family (because if your family isn\u2019t ready to accept that you are in a relationship with a black man, they will make it hell for him as much as for you). If you aren\u2019t ready to do the right thing and stand up for your relationship with him with everyone, then you all are not ready to introduce him to your family, and frankly, you don\u2019t respect him for who he is- a person who deserves to be treated as an equal.",

I\u2019ve been with my current partner for three years and it wasn\u2019t easy but now only certain people from the family are okay with it and love us both. It took me a year to even tell my parents when I was dating my partner. Almost ended my relationship with my mother but she had to make her own decision if she wanted to be in my life or not. She chose to be open minded and now loves my partner. You do what\u2019s best for you",

All this to say, make sure he understands that this is how your family operates in case he has to meet them. They are rude to assume things about someone they haven\u2019t met or gotten to know. Unfortunately you cannot control your family, but you can control the situation. Don\u2019t force anything either. If things start looking like they\u2019re gonna go bad, leave. Don\u2019t make excuses, just leave the area and make sure both you and him are ok. My family is racist and I\u2019m Asian. I ended up writing them off and couldn\u2019t be more happy tbh.",

Because trust me if he\u2019s put in a situation where he\u2019s treated like less than A HUMAN without preparing him first he wouldn\u2019t handle it well and that will only confirm a FALSE narrative .\n\nIf you really like him I\u2019ll advise you keep him away from your family, people are entitled to their prejudices wrong or right don\u2019t try to force him on them. Cause this is decades of hate they can only try or pretend to tolerate him for your sake but not him as a person.",

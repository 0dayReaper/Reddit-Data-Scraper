    "postText": "I was a victim and perpetrator of COCSA. When I was 6 I was introduced to sex by my bully, she showed me her body and wanted to do \u201cit\u201d, at the time I didnt want to show my body, but she kept pressuring me and told me if I didnt she wouldn\u2019t be my friend anymore. My mom came into the room before I could show my body, she didnt really see what was happening. My bully wanted me to go to her house to continue things, I asked for permission and my mom said no, my friend got really upset and called my mom a fat ugly pig/cow.\n\nA few years later when I was 10 or 11, I inappropriately touched my little brother who was 2 or 3 at the time. It only happened once, there was no coercion, no pressure or anything. I remember I said we should pull down our pants and show each other our parts, I touched his for a few seconds then told him to touch mine, at that point he gagged and I stopped everything and realized what I\u2019d done, but still didnt understand the ramifications.\n\nI have an awesome relationship with my brother now, he tells me about his secrets, if someone is bullying him at school, or about his girlfriend, but I can\u2019t help but feel as if I shouldnt be by his side, I feel horrible and disgusted with myself, I feel immensely guilty. \n\nSometimes I dont understand how\u2019d things turn out like this, why didnt I realize before I did it that it was wrong I cant live with myself. I told my mom about it around 2 months ago, she told me that she realizes that she shouldve always just stayed at home and cared for us, that she finally understood my depression all throughout high school, and that if he remembers that we will talk with him about it and apologize together. \n\nI wish I could reverse time, that way I wouldve just been a victim instead of both, I just cant believe I was a victim and a perpetrator, why did it have to be me? Why did I do that to him? I dont understand.",

            "comment": "You did that to him because someone did it to you. I think it\u2019s important to remember that you were a little kid, and you didn\u2019t do it with the intention of \u201cgetting off\u201d like an adult abusing a child would. It was curiosity. \n\nIt\u2019s really common for kids to do the \u201cI\u2019ll show you mine if you show me yours\u201d thing. Curiosity is normal. It\u2019s on the parents to teach their kids how to be curious in an appropriate way. \n\nYou weren\u2019t being malicious. You were a kid that didn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t appropriate.",

I fear that when he becomes an adult he realizes, \u201chey, my sister actually molested me\u201d. My whole childhood I was afraid that my future kids wouldnt have an immediate family to hang out with, since my family on my dads and moms side is already really fucked up, but when my mom had my brother I thought \u201cyay, I have a new friend to play with, he looks adorable, and I\u2019ll finally be able to have family reunions like they have them in the movies\u201d. But now I\u2019m scared I\u2019ve ruined it all, that when he remembers it\u2019ll be extremely traumatic that I, his sister, did that. I remember things from when I was a toddler and sometimes he\u2019ll tell me about stories when he was 2.",

It\u2019s not the act, necessarily, but the intention &amp; the reception. I don\u2019t think you intended to hurt your brother. I think you were curious, stemming from an experience you had, &amp; you know better now because of it. You weren\u2019t someone taking advantage of another. You didn\u2019t intend that &amp; you didn\u2019t know better. You were curious. Don\u2019t let this define you &amp; ruin you man.",

I have an awesome boyfriend and all, an jour ago I told him about how I had hurt someone in my childhood and how I was hurt, but I couldnt bring myself to tell him all the details like how it was my brother. I really thought he\u2019d hate me, but I was surprised, he acknowledged that he can\u2019t really take the pain away and he cant fix it and that I should talk to a therapist. Thing is, I fear that my therapist would have to report me, even if it happened a decade ago, I still live with my brother, not to mention the age gap.",

It\u2019s likely he doesn\u2019t remember.\n\nIt would be different if you were older but at 10-11 you don\u2019t even really understand all that. I think your just having a lot of guilt. But it\u2019s not your fault for being a kid and not understanding your actions at the time",

Also my bully lives 3 hours away, I havent talked to her since I moved when I was 7, last time she contacted me was when I was 13 and she wanted me to go to her quince, and also wanted us to invest $200 and travel the 3 hours and still expected us to buy a gift, I think I really resented her for that. I can forgive what she did because she was a kid and likely had something happen to her, but not apologizing before hand, especially if she bullied me, is just not it. On the other hand, I wouldve been completely fine with her if she was actually nice to me as a kid.",

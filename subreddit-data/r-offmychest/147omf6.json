    "postText": "So anyways, there was this news about how a mother murdered her 5 year old daughter (I gotta admit, in a very creative way), it's a long story.\n\nBut basically, this guy cheated, the girl he cheated with got pregnant, and so the wife decided to get a divorce. He and that girl got married, wife #2 gave birth to a baby girl. But this wife #2 pretty much left him and the daughter after a bit because she is someone who just can't be tied down. Anyways, this guy got back together with wife #1, and wife #1 treated the daughter like her own child. (or at least that's what they all thought)\n\nBut then, this child got very very ill all of a sudden and died. Her uncle thought that her death was very weird and so they investigated. And found out that the room her mother (wife #1) made for her was incredibly poisonous in every way possible (paint, floors, furniture...etc) The husband couldn't believe this, and thought that it must've been an accident at first. But then, after asking the person who sold these things to his wife and discovering a diary of his wife's. He couldn't lie to himself anymore and was absolutely devastated. \n\nAnyways... people were talking about this news. Not a single person thinks that the mother was responsible for the child's death. Everyone said that it was the husband's fault for cheating, and the fault of the child's biological mother for leaving. And personally, I am just in absolute awe and disgust by the logic that a murderer of a child is innocent because at one point in her life, she was hurt in the past. \n\nPeople were also saying that he is absolutely shameless for asking his wife to accept this child, and should have abandoned the child to foster care because it was not fair for the wife to take care of a child that's not biologically hers. \n\nLike, yes cheating was 100% wrong, but that is not an excuse to murder an innocent child. If anything, this wife should be hating her husband, not the child. In fact, why do you get back into a relationship knowing that you cannot forgive. Why did you chose to marry a guy you know has a child that you can't accept? \n\nI have been cheated on, I do know the pain, I feel like I should sympathize with this woman who murdered her daughter more, but I just find it really hard to the second I found out what she did. IDK if it's wrong with me, or with the other people talking about this.",

Objects of revenge, objects violence, objects to be sold and discarded.\nThey\u2019re not people, so they\u2019re always an afterthought. \nIn my country manslaughter chargers for filicide are half what they\u2019d be for adults. Murder charges range from 18 months to 25 years for killing children, but often won\u2019t exceed 10 years.\nOften, people who harm children aren\u2019t the fathers and it\u2019s easier for people to deny it or rationalise it then to realise that we have a problem as a society.",

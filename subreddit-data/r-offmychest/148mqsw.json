    "postText": "Let me tell you my story from birth till now.\n\nI was born in a military family where both my father and mother was in military. I can't really remembery childhood but all that I can remember currently was that my parents was really strict on me in my study and I don't have friends. Because both my parents are military people therefore my family will always relocated to other bases depending on works so I don't really have childhood friends.\n\nMy parents always wanted me to become smart and have a great job as I was the oldest brother between my 4 sibling including myself. They always push me especially in multiplication. I will always remember how my parents will scream at me in my car for not being able to quickly answer a random question he blurted out of nowhere. I'm sorry dad I just 9 years old I don't really remember 15x13 in 10 seconds. I also wanted to said that my parents are both asian therefore you can apply those asian parents stereotypes. I remember every night I sleep early praying my father wouldn't come to my room and ask me for multiplication of 12. I still remember how my father would throw shoes to my head when I was forced to stand in corner of shame for not being able to remember multiplication of 12. \n\nI wasn't really a good learner in my class. I always will get B or C in most grade so I would hide the exam paper under my table. But I still need my parents to sign my report card so I always prepared myself to be hit with harsh word like idiot,stupid,brain dead and ungrateful. They always said that they do this for the best of me so I keep going through till my elementary school national exam where I got the highest grade possible in each subject. For the first time my parents call me their proud child  and I was happy about it.My hardwork paid off or so I thought. When I don't get to enter my parents choice of boarding school they said about how if I use my brain much earlier in exam before the national exam that I can enter their prefer boarding school. So at the end I get to enter different boarding school but I still feel happy because I can get away from my parents not knowing worse thing are about to happen.\n\nWhen I enter boarding school at age of 13, I feel very guilty about it. My parents keep saying about how they wanted to put me in but it was expensive that my mom has to pawn his gold so he can get me in. I also feel lonely at the time because I don't really know how to make friends. I feel sad but that was before a person my age approach me and telling me to become my friends. Because I was lonely and weak at that time I was bullied by a bully gang but one of the bully gang approach me and said he wanted to be one my friends. My worst mistake I've ever done and will never repeat it again was that I tell him about my problem not knowing that another one of his gang was hiding under my bed. So it in reality was a trap setup by them. After that they used my vulnerability against me and I become their slave for 5 years which is from start to the end of boarding school. I was used like a butler where they will force me to clean their dishes that they left in like 4 weeks on top of their locker, has to do their homework, help them cheat on their exam, become a class clown so they can show their manliness on front of the girl. At one point I was forced into gay sexual intercourse with one of their member as a way for him to release his stress. This thing keep on happening for 5 years.\n\nThe boarding school has very high respect toward the bully group cause they represent the masculinity traits that the school wanted. The bully gang was protected and even become member of students council and discipline committee. So if I report their action toward the teacher, they will get an advice while they will hit me in gang in my room after they get the information. When I tell my parents they said that I'm not manly enough that I need to fight them. The school principal also said to me about how I shouldn't make a police report about this in order to take care of school name that conflict should be resolved internally. \n\nMy parents also wanted to take me I to a military school when I was 15. This is because soldier son who managed to enter the military school was seemed very good and talented and that the parents parenting was good in order to create a soldier that can serve the country. I don't like the idea but my parents forced me to take the entrance exam. When I tell my problem toward my school counselor with also all my problem I've been going through , he decided to call my parents and discussed with them. At the end he said about how my problem wasn't really a big deal that it was good in order to make myself as a better person. After that my parents called out on me about how I ruin their reputation because I tell my problem toward the counselor. At the end I didn't managed to get into the military school and still stay in the boarding school and get bullied for 3 more year.\n\nAt the end I finished my high school final national exam with above average results and get myself into a polytechnic. Here right now for some reasons I always feel sad about how lonely I am and the facts that I'm ugly that girls won't like me. My feed is also filled with how men like myself are trash or that men like me who isn't the alpha won't get any girlfriend or love because I've no value. I also read about how women a don't like me that they see men as dangerous being. When I read about the statistics about it, I was shocked. I mean does that make me like those men who does those bad things that make women hate me. At the end of the day I'm just a sad lonely man at the age of 20 with no friends, no partners and probably would never be loved. I read about how all people should receive unconditional love. If that so where mine. Why my life all I keep getting was bad stuff. Where is my time for life to treat me well. All I wanted was to be treated well. People said go to therapy but they don't realize men like me who still hanging to his parents money in order to survive while studying is hard. Imagine spending 2 month worth of food just to go to 30 minutes session. \n\nAll that I can said is I'm tired of living.\n\nIf you read till the end I appreciate you taking your time reading this. I really do and I want to said is thank you",

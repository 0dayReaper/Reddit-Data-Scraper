    "postText": "So, I've had a gf for a good long while now. We seemed like we were hitting it off pretty well but today that all changed. I wanted to talk to about our relationship and I thought I was saying the right things and thought she would understand but alas, I don't think I'll hear from her again. It's a shame, really. I genuinely wanted things to work out this time but oh well I guess. Some people just aren't meant to be loved. And I might just have to accept that fact.",

So I refrain from saying anything for a while. And I didn't mean anything by it. I just wanted to talk and was willing to negotiate how we go forward. Am I wrong for wanting to change things a bit?",

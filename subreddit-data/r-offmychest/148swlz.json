    "postText": "Everyday. \n\nI (M45) will chill on the couch, drink my tea, play some video games. ( I work, and the kids are old enough to care for themselves so i don't need to worry about giving them attention, I clean) and relax. And this is usually the end of the day, after work. \n\nShe (F47) will literally do anything for attention from me. I watch a movie and she will get infront of the tv and start twerking. I will play a video game and she'll start talking about trans people and starting an argument w me about it and i gotta pause it, she don't even ask me to pause my game she just stand infront it or sit next to me. I like gay ppl and what not i do not care what they do. Im not racist or nothing none of that.\n\nI say do not kiss my head. I do not like it. She does it anyway. I just don't like it ik it's weird but you cant just do that. \n\nShe walk around in lingerie and im like your titties are out and i don't want to see them. Around the kids too, I don't like it.\n\nShe will randomly start moaning, singing at 100% volume, or saying googol gaga uwahh uwahhh and stuff and i get so mad everytime that i just don't talk to her.\n\nShe nasty, i do not want to touch her. I hate the smell of her perfume. If she's making food i get disgusted at her touching it. Why cant we chill and she just not talk. \n\nShe be trying to have intimate conversations with me and get me to open up and the conversations just her explaining to me how i got autism (saying im mentally handicapped) and why i owe her my privacy and why she can touch me if she wants to. Then she be crying about how i don't love or care about her and i gotta give her a fake hug but rly im trynna get her to stop talking and go away. \n\nMaybe its cus she an extrovert and im an introvert.",

If she rly sad bc i rejected her then yes i feeling bad for her but it's not like a romantic kinda imma fight for you it's a dangggg she probably insecure i feel bad for rejecting somebody. That kinda thing i don't think like i personally feeling bad for her and loving her n stuff. I haven't loved her since we had kids. Bc she used to take all the attention from the kids saying she ain't getting none. Like i dont wanna hear you screaming and saying googoogahgah cus you want attention it's weird!",

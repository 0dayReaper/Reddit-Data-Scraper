    "postText": "I have a good life. I live with my boyfriend. We're building a wonderful life together. I love him, and I have no doubts that he loves me. We have two cats, disposable income, a decent amount of time together, etc. The only thing I don't really have in my life is my family, as he and I moved about 700 miles away from them a little less than a year ago. Admittedly, this is quite a loss. But I still talk to them a lot.\n\nThe problem is that no matter how satisfied I am with my life, sometimes I'm just not ok. I understand why. I have clinical depression. No matter how good life is, my brain will always have a chemical imbalance. And it's hard to keep myself out of a funk sometimes.\n\nI know that it affects BF. On the bad days, when I tell him that nothing is really doing much for me that day, (idk, sparking joy IG), he always asks if he's not able to. And he is! It's just a little fleeting and not as strong as it would be on one of my normal days. But I know he feels bad. And it makes me feel bad. Because I know he's trying so hard to keep me happy, but I'm always going to get like this sometimes. I did tell him that. I really wish I didn't have to.\n\nI try to keep everything under control. I really do. It's exhausting sometimes. But I don't want him to feel like he's failing me, because he isn't. My brain is just mean. We really are happy together. Or, at least I'm happy with him. I'm pretty sure he's happy with me. He always tells me he is, and I'd rather take his word for it. He's never given me any reason not to trust his word, so I'm not going to.\n\nI wish I could just be normal. But tbf I guess I don't really know what that means. Normal people have bad days, too. Just less? I guess? But I don't want to make people feel like they're not enough for me. I don't want to make him feel like he isn't enough for me. I do feel happy. I feel happier and more free than I ever have in my life. But I still have bad days. There are still days when I can barely get myself out of bed. I feel so ungrateful. I feel like I'm taking everything for granted. I worked so hard to get here, to have this life. I chose this life, and I don't regret my choice. But sometimes I still feel like I'm falling a part. I should be happy. I shouldn't feel like this. But I do. I certainly do right now. Just last week I was fine, but now I feel like I'm in a rut again. Well, less so today. I was at my worst two days ago.\n\nI was kind of mean these past few days. I didn't call him names or say anything to make him feel bad about himself (at least not intentionally) but I was pretty passive aggressive and snarky. I try really hard not to take it out on him, but I register that I still have a long way to go. I'm just glad that he's able to forgive me. I don't think I've ever been like that with him, so it must have come as a shock. I need to do better, in that regard. I really do. He doesn't deserve that kind of treatment. Nobody does. He didn't do anything wrong. I've already apologized for it, and we talked it through. That might be why I started to feel a little better in the first place. I really need to stop keeping it to myself when I feel this way.\n\nBut that just leads us back to the first problem. I feel so guilty when I'm not ok. I don't know how to get him to understand that it has nothing to do with him. Or, maybe he does understand, intellectually. I've told him it's not his fault. I can tell it still hurts him. I don't even think this is a problem I can solve.\n\nI should probably go back to therapy. I haven't found a new therapist here. Or a doctor. Or dentist. Or anything like that. I really need to get on that. I haven't even gotten around to getting new glasses.\n\nI feel so guilty every time I'm not ok. I really do feel like I'm making him feel like he's not enough for me. Or he's done something terrible. I might even be making him feel like I regret moving. I don't.\n\nI'm rambling now. I'll stop this here.\n\nTLDR: I feel ridiculously guilty whenever my depression rears its ugly head because I feel like I'm taking everything in my life for granted, and that I'm hurting people.",

    "postText": "TL;DR at the end \n\nI 16F honestly don't know what I want to get out of this post. Maybe to vent or get some advice from strangers that might actually read my post. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately about my situation with my mom. I don\u2019t feel much for her. At most, I wish her the best, until she says or does something to me or others around me.\n\nI don't want to say my mom is a terrible person, but she is not a good person. She's the type to send food back and sometimes she doesn't cause a scene, the keyword was sometimes. She is the type of person who yells at a worker, or gets really pissed off when something is blown out of proportion, sometimes she's in the right but others\u2026\n\nNow to me, and how she treats me, I think I'm a little short sided when it comes to this topic, but here we go. My mother has proven me wrong time and time again when I try to tell myself that she is not that bad and try to put effort into our relationship. She did things that were well uncalled for, like beating me for having 5 loads of clothes to wash, two of those loads were my bed sheets. Slapping the crap out of me because I woke up late, and continued hitting me while asking questions. With me just waking up and my tendency to say stupied stuff second after being woken up, my brain hadn\u2019t been cooperating and it only made her angrier. \n \nShe bitten my hand when I was a kid because I was a terrible nail biter and she hated that. Told me she\u2019d shave my head since I wanted to be a boy so bad. She hit me with a hanger repeatedly because I couldn\u2019t spell a word correctly. She choked me when I left my keys at school. I knew exactly where they were, but she wasn\u2019t hearing any of it. There are a handful more of Incidents with her but this post is getting long as it is.\n\nSo on to today's accusation. She\u2019s asked me the \u201cwhat is wrong with you,\u201d  question before. I have to convince her nothing is wrong because there are a lot of things wrong and it's mostly centered around her. I'm not ready, nor am I comfortable sharing how I feel about her. When I don't even see her as a protective haven to talk to. I don\u2019t love my mother, heck i don't even like her. She has a mutual ground that keeps changing courses depending on how she continues to treat me. I won\u2019t say I could never hate her because I know it's possible. \n\nI\u2019m sure she thinks she did a good job of parenting, when in reality her own daughter doesn't even love her anymore. Every single time I say goodnight, leave the house or vice versa, and end a phone call with her. I lie and say those three words I don't mean at all. I tried to feel bad about it but I don't, I can't bring myself to feel for the relationship that died for me years ago. \n\nI\u2019ve been debating with myself to cut her off for the longest when I move out. When I ask for others' opinions I get mixed responses, and honestly I don't know what I should do. I wouldn\u2019t be debating this so hard if she hadn\u2019t put me in a program that could land me a scholarship. Granted I hate being there, and the program is for investing and entrepreneurship, which is something I am not interested in. I thought I could make something positive out of it so I went along. \n\nI kept thinking over the way she would react to me ghosting her, and I feel like I\u2019d slapped her in the face if i did, I mean it was well deserved in my book but still. As many times she disregarded me, disrespected me, I never disrespected her, she's accused me of it many times, and I feel offended every time she does, but still. \n\nAnyway\u2026I don't really know where to end this so I'll leave it here. Have at it in the comments if you made it this far. And Before anyone says anything about therapy, I'm already on once I get out of here.\n\nTL;DR- The situation with my mom is pretty complicated for me (16F), and I have mixed feelings about it. I\u2019ve lost the love I had for her a long time ago, due to mistreatment and her ways of disciplining me and going too far at times. She doesn't understand why I've been so distant with her, and it is honestly sad to know she'll never see the way that she treated me was wrong. I feel as if i should cut her off but she\u2019s done something for me that has been thinking against it. She put me in a scholarship program so I\u2019m ify on if I want to or not, because it feels like a slap to the face. I don't know how to end this but I hope you get the jist.",

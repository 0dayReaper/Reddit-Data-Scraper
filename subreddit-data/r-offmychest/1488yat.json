    "postText": "I act like I don't care. Who am I fooling. Can't get it out of my head. Rent-free. I don't have a choice. Perhaps I do, but believing I don't gives me the last ounce of comfort. And, in a way, I'm right. Most of life is built on competition. Food, land, and opportunities. The only way you can stay out of this is to be born rich. Sometimes, not even. I ran away. I had nowhere to go. No one to turn to. I keep coming back. There's no escape. The walls are there. I distract myself. In fact, that's all I can do. I read, I drink coffee, I pour myself a shot of whisky before bed, I go to KFC, and I lie to myself on most days. I don't blame anyone. I'm just tired. ",

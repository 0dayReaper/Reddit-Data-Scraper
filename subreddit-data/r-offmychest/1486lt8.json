    "postText": "I (22f) have 3 tattoos. I got 2 when I was still 17, in the garage of an amateur artist who is now in prison for doing underage tattoos. I got my 3rd on my 18th birthday. It was free as a gift from a family friend who owns a shop. His style is not *at all* what I wanted, and I absolutely hate the tattoo. \n\nI regret all 3 of them, and I want my 3rd one completely removed. It has borderline traumatized me from getting more, though I do want more eventually. \n\nMy boyfriend (22m) of 3 years has always voiced that \u201cwomen don\u2019t look good with tattoos\u201d. I\u2019ve always thought it was misogynistic and disgusting, but he doesn\u2019t bring it up often so I tend to forget. He also assures me that my tattoos don\u2019t bother him (they are all small and none have color)\u2026 he just would prefer I don\u2019t get more. At the end of the day though it is my body, and I will be getting more if I please. \n\nLast weekend I went on vacation with his family. His dad got on the topic of tattoos and started voicing the same opinion. He said women with tattoos are \u201cdisgusting\u201d and that \u201cthey can take a woman from a 10 to a 5\u201d. I should add that this man has tattoos himself (my BF does not). His mom even piped in and said that she wanted one at one point, but his dad convinced her not to get any. \n\nMy BF let his dad go on and on with this disgusting opinion while I sat there with my tattoos. This was also a vacation that involved swimming, so when the time came for me to put on a swimsuit I was self conscious. I don\u2019t understand why my BF would let his dad say these things knowing I have tattoos. Isn\u2019t he, by association, calling me disgusting?\n\nI don\u2019t know what insults me more- that his dad said these things, or that my BF let him. But now I am just uncomfortable.",

            "comment": "Wow, I mean he's your bf so it's your choice, but I'd honestly dump the whole family. \n\nBody art is a personal choice and saying someone is automatically unattractive because of tattoos is like saying someone with black hair is automatically unattractive. You literally know nothing about that person and decide to judge them off of 1 single physical trait. \n\nNot only does your bf get his misogynistic ideas from his dad he's willing to just sit and listen no objection. \n\nI'm really sorry your only experience with tattoos is getting shitty free ones. I'm covered in tattoos and of course I have a few that aren't perfect but I love them as much as my favorites because my whole body tells the story of my life. I think it looks beautiful. As beautiful as plus size women who's comfortable in her own body, as beautiful as cancer survivor who has accepted her flat chest.\n\nWomen are never meant to look a certain way to be beautiful. Beauty is being kind to yourself, then others. \n\nYour boyfriend is sounding pretty ugly to me.",

            "comment": "Sounds like your boyfriend\u2019s dad is misogynistic and he\u2019s grown up with that worldview and internalized it himself. Unless he already recognizes that and is actively trying to better himself there, which sounds highly unlikely, you\u2019re infinitely better off without him. It\u2019s still early days and he will get more and more comfortable controlling and degrading you as time goes on and you\u2019re still there, and by staying with him, allowing it.\n\nMy best advice here is just get the heck out of that relationship and make room for someone that, at the barest of bare minimums, does not actively try to make you feel bad about yourself.",

            "comment": "I mean, guys can have opinions about their preferences without it being rooted in misogyny. If your tattoos are small, he probably doesn\u2019t lump you into that \u2018disgusting\u2019 category. That being said, it sounds like he\u2019s a hypocrite and if you were my daughter I\u2019d advise you to leave get someone who wasn\u2019t raised and influenced by a loser. But I have no context aside from that.",

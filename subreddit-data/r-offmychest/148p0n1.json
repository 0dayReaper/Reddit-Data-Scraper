    "postText": "I am on a bit of a holiday and so I decided to go home, where I was raised and where my parents still live, for a while. I thought that maybe I should rekindle the relationship between me and them, plus also the guilt of their aging drove me to promise I'll be staying for three weeks. \nIt's been 6 days and I've already had two panic attacks and suddenly I'm asthmatic again. (It's been 3yrs since I needed an inhaler)\n\nSeeing my parents together just triggers me so much. My dad has been abusive to my mom my whole life, both physical and emotional. And my mum in turn has been abusive to me my whole life. \n\nBut recently, they started to get along after the passing of my brother. I thought that maybe with the new found peace at home I would be comfortable staying there. But I am not. Infact I am actually getting literally sick from staying in this place.\n\nSeeing them sitting together just reminds me of the times my dad would just spontaneously reach out and strangle my mom when he was pissed. Or whenever my dad's voice would be raised, it was almost always followed by a loud smack or slap of some kind. Or the loud banging of doors or the rapid opening of my bedroom door by my mom seeking refuge in my room when dad was being abusive.\n\n I haven't slept for more than 4hrs since I got here, which says Alot coz I love sleeping.\n My body is in hyper alert, and my heart races for no reason. \n\nI haven't been home for longer than a week since I left for college, and when I was, it was during the holidays and we were either in some lodging of some kind of with the rest of the extended family. \nSo I haven't had this one on one time.with them since the dark ages (the days it was ridiculously bad).\n\n I'm starting to come to the realization that I for one can't just move on past all the trauma that happened. And being around them is undoing my mental health, and everything I have taken so much time trying to heal from. I do care for them don't get me wrong, and yes I will take care of them financially if they need it, but that's the furthest I can allow myself to go\n\nIt hurts to know that no matter the work and time I put into therapy, (years actually)would never be able to suffice the trauma that I have witnessed. I think this will be the last time I will spend time like this with them. When I leave here, I'm actually never coming back. So help me God.",

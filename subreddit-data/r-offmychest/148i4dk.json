    "postText": "My partner has cheated on me multiple times. He\u2019s had affairs, emotional and physical. He has pleasured himself to other women\u2019s pics on his fb and insta. Messaged sexual messages on snap. \n\nIn everything else he is so good to me. I suffer physically and he looks after me. Hw has taken on my 3 children (a lot of issues and mental health problems and behaviour problems) so that\u2019s not been easy. He will help around the house, buy me chocolates and flowers. \nIt\u2019s so confusing. In a lot of respects he treats me like a queen but then shoves it in my face that I\u2019m not good enough. All the women he\u2019s cheated with or messaged or pleasured himself to are prettier, thinner and a hell of an upgrade to me. Im not been modest or feeling sorry for myself. I just know the reality of what I am. Overweight, not good looking and I don\u2019t particularly have a winning personality. Im depressed, have rheumatoid which affects me massively, don\u2019t have any friends, not a social butterfly and I\u2019ve got baggage with the kids and past traumas. \n\nSo why is he still with me if he is always on the look out for better? But then why does he treat me so amazingly? \n\nWhen we argue he can be quite nasty. I\u2019ve never been afraid of him but he will say I am crazy (a massive thing for me as I struggle with my mental health lately) throw my parenting at me that I\u2019m not stern enough, tell me I\u2019m the reason we aren\u2019t working because I\u2019ve got mood swings and that he\u2019s sick of me not trusting him when he has repeatedly said he won\u2019t cheat again and I\u2019m all he wants. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that when it\u2019s happened so many times. Plus every other person I\u2019ve been with has cheated on me and I\u2019ve experienced DV (not with him). He thinks I need to let it go and by holding onto the past we can\u2019t move forward. \n\nBut how do I trust him? Don\u2019t get me wrong I get it and i always understood why he did what he did (again I know what I am and what I bring to the table) and it\u2019s always in the back of my mind that I\u2019m a stop gap for something better. I understand these are my issues to deal with and heal from not his but how do I do it? \n\nI love him so much. I\u2019ve never loved anyone like I do him. I just don\u2019t know what I can do to make this work? How do I put trust in him when he\u2019s promised it will never happen again? He\u2019s offered me access to his phone, deleted snap and insta and he went to therapy (a condition I asked because of his unresolved childhood issues and to get to why he cheats). When I ask him why I get told he doesn\u2019t know why or things were bad between us at the time or we weren\u2019t having sex. \n\nPlease help me to be better and any advice on what I can do to make things better would be massively appreciated. Thank you.",

    "postText": "I will convince myself that someone hates me over literally nothing, I'm constantly apologizing for being annoying/overbearing/negative/repetitive and I don't know how to fix any of those problems. If someone's tone is even slightly off (or at least if I feel it is) then I will try to give them the reassurance I'd need in a situation like that. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with getting the silent treatment as a punishment growing up or not, but I really do not ever feel worthy of anything good and I'm constantly walking on eggshells in order to try and not hurt anyone. \nI'm just so worried about being rejected and I always come off as rude/sensitive when trying to ask for anything to change. It feels like I'm never going to be good enough for anyone else and I don't know how to be.\nI absolutely love and adore my boyfriend, he's such a kind and honest gentleman who's just so sweet and caring. I don't understand how he puts up with me constantly apologizing or coming off wrong, constantly trying to reassure everything and constantly being annoying as shit. I can't fix myself, I can't change, I can't stop being annoying and all of the things mentioned in the beginning, so I try to apologize for it. Then I'm not genuine enough because I'm always apologizing and repeating those things. Am I selfish?",

    "postText": "I (34F) have never loved my boyfriend (33M) of 6 years because I still love my ex (29M). I'm with him just for convenience of companionship as I don't want to live alone. You can check my history for more details.\r  \n\r  \nThe thing is the said ex contacted me and of course I'm head over heels with him. I have to hide my smile in front of my boyfriend. Right now we're talking about sleeping together as he told me that he had the best sex of his life with me. However he is not very open about possibility of being in relationship with me right now. He doesn't say no but for now he just wants to sleep with me. It's ok, I would be very happy to at least sleep with him and hope he will commit to me over time. So I already decided I will do it with him.\r  \n\r  \nThe problem is what to do about my boyfriend. I should tell him right? But it's not guaranteeed that my ex will want relationship with me so I should keep my boyfriend to be safe and not end up alone. That would mean cheating on him for some time until hopefully my ex comes back to me completely, or leaves again.",

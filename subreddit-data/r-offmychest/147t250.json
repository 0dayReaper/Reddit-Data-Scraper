    "postText": "Yes. It's true. I was in his home and he asked me if I've ever kissed a customer before. I just looked at him, blinking and then asked why he would ask me something like this. He was like \"Is that inappropriate?\". The guy has a lot of money and so he is likely used to pushing boundaries all over the place. He had already expressed interest in taking me out a time before and I told him I would be interested in going out for a bite. Due to scheduling conflicts, this hasn't happened yet. I was like \"typically, a kiss would be like some sort of progression...like you take me on a few dates and then maybe move in for the smooch.\" Anyhow, what a creep move. ",

    "postText": "So last week my husband got a phonecall saying that his father has terminal cancer, he has 9 months or so left with treatment (which he is choosing to do) thankfully. I think one of the main reasons that he is doing the treatment is in the hope that hubby, our 2 kids and I can go over to see him (hubby's family is in Aus and we are in NZ). Hubby and I really really want to go over but for passports and flights alone we are looking at about $4k and I don't know where we are going to get this from.\n\nTwo days later we got a message from hubby's uncle saying that his 90yo Grandma had a fall, is in hospital with a couple of broken bones and we found out today that she will be in there for about 6 weeks getting physio before going into rehab.\n\nThen today I get a phone call from my mum saying that she is going to hospital because she has been sick for 2 weeks now and is getting worse despite the Dr giving her antibiotics last week. She saw her Dr again today and she was the one who told mum to go. So now we are just waiting to find out what is wrong.\n\nWith all of this going on I am trying to hide the tears. Hubby is struggling as it is and I don't want to make him feel worse and we don't want to tell the kids what is going on at this stage.\n\nThis has all happened in the space of 5 days. I am stressed, I am upset and I feel like I need to keep it together for everyone else which is why I am posting here.",

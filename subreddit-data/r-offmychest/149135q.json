    "postText": "I've been with my boyfriend for about a year and up until recently I have loved every second I spend with him. However, in the last few months I've begun to notice he's just not the brightest bulb in the box. I always knew he was a little behind but lately I'm realizing just how far behind he is. \n\nHe struggles to keep up with regular conversations on a regular basis, believes every single thing he sees on social media to be 100% true.. even onion articles or just straight up jokes, gets lost on roads/paths hes been on multiple times, and all around just isn't very bright. \n\nI used to think it was endearing when i had to walk him through things, or think it was funny when he forgot the first half of a conversation that he started. But after a while it got old. I started getting annoyed (on the inside) whenever he would get lost or confused, and over time it just got more annoying. \n\nI love literally every other thing about him (even if it doesn't seem like i do from this post). But it's getting to the point where it's just too much, so i figured i would vent about it here in hopes to try to move past it so it's not a problem anymore. I'm sorry if i sound like a total asshole in this,  just had to tell someone about it to see if it was just a problem of me bottling it up.",

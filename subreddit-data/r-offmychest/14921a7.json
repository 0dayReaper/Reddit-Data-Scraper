Two weeks ago i decided to just say heck it and delete my Discord account to get away from this people that i think they would be better without me. We have knowen each other not in persona but through the wonders of the world wide web, they're from the states, im from the EU. \n\nSo what lad me to take me this action? Well i came to a realization that i felt like, inside our group, i was the one that caused most trouble, like i was not welcome, i was only kept because they are the radast nicest people i know and they didn't wanted to hurt me. I'm not a troublemaker, just an idiot, but i felt like a troublemaker sometimes and definitely sometimes without me not realizing it i was hurting my friends. So... I decided to just write a message to one of my friends and press the delete button on my account, next sunday my discord account will be completely gone. To be honest... I want to go back to them, but first, that would make me an hypocrite like i was sometimes to them and second, it would just validate my point that I just hurt them if i return. Still on another platform, a game, that we can only communicate with a limited char message two of them left a message saying I'm missed, reading that kinda broke me, but it's what makes me come back to them...",

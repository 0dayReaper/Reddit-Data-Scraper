    "postText": "Warnings: talking ab suicide, cutting, and drug use. \n\nI don\u2019t want to do it anymore. My best friend has someone else now. Her number fucking 1. So she won\u2019t care. My mom doesn\u2019t like me neither does my oldest brother. My other brother is going to college, we were close last summer but that\u2019s all gone now that I also live with my dad. And my dad finally got his perfect family he wanted. That\u2019s leaves me. A 14 year old drug addict. Ik sounds so fucking dumb. The only thing there for me is alcohol, pot, and any thing I can get high on. Noting crazy tho like meth or coke. Just normal shit a 14 year old can get there hands on. And now will all that it brings me here. Cutting stopped working a year ago but I still do it bc I feel one day I\u2019ll feel that pain of the blade on my skin again. I have no more money, spent it all on cigs, vapes, and weed. I feel dull. Numb. Lost. Dead almost. I\u2019ve always wanted to be in a punk band, no one to start it with tho. I just feel so useless. No one likes me at school. I have no \u201cspecial\u201d talents.  I\u2019m not smart so I have pretty much little to no future. Barely made it to 9th grade. I\u2019m not pretty, skinny, or normal looking. I\u2019m rude to everyone. I come off exactly the person I am. No friends, loner, stoner, and an asshole. I just feel like there\u2019s nothing left. I don\u2019t want to continue. But at the same time, I\u2019m scared. But if there happened to be an accident that I died in. I would be to mad. I just couldn\u2019t keep it to myself anymore. That\u2019s it, if you made it this far I\u2019m surprised. Say something, don\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t make a difference to me.",

            "comment": "Sounds hard dude. Life can get really rough sometimes. Maybe you're not ready for sobriety just yet, but the alcohol doesn't help your mood at all. Not trying to parent you or whatever, it took me a long time to quit drinking, but at some point I had to own up to the fact that booze just makes everything worse. \n\nDo you live in a city or a small town? I was super lucky at 14 to be in a place where I was in a punk band, then years later in my mid-20s, after being in two bands throughout high school and college, I couldn't find anyone to play music with. It fucking SUCKED dude, so I feel that pain. It's hard as shit. \n\nBut ok check out this dude Atom and His Package. Solo punk project from the 90s. Dude got introduced to music sequencers and fucked around with one (the \"package\" to his Atom) and now he's a legend in the punk scene. Maybe try that. I've actually been thinking about doing the same thing now that I live in a different city from my band. Solo shit is cool, people respect the hell out of that stuff, and it's a great way to get things off your chest and out of your mind. \n\nIt's a clich\u00e9 thing to say, but I'm much happier now being solely addicted to music than to booze and smokes. Alcohol just turns all your shit inward and then there's nowhere left for it to go, but writing music and performing is the best fucking feeling in the world. Nothing beats the high of being on stage. Chase that shit and have fun with it. I'm telling ya, it literally saved my life.",

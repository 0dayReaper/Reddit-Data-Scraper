    "postText": "Her hand got infected. She's better now, but my dad just told me that if it were up to him, he would put my cat down. He said that since he has a history of seriously injuring someone, if it happens again, someone could sue me for negligence. I'm at a complete loss for what to do. I believe my cat has a right to life. \n\nMy cat isn't aggressive, he just doesn't like to be pet when he's on his back. He's sensitive about certain situations but overall he's very social and affectionate.\n\nI feel as though I can't rehome him with this development. No one will want to take him. No one understands him. I also don't want to dump him in a shelter, I don't know if I could live with myself. \n\nMy parents said they don't want to interact with my cat anymore, and I don't feel great about inviting them over because of this. My dad is holding the accident over my head as well.\n\nIs my only option to run away and live alone?",

I bet she doesn\u2019t want to be pet on the stomach by you or anyone else when she is chilling on the couch/bed. If they wont come over because of the cat, you can go to them. Or you can put the cat in a different room when they\u2019re over. The cat should not be killed.",

    "postText": "So first off sorry if this is a lot. \n\nTo summarize everything three years ago (my sister and I are now 21 and 22) I told my mom that my dad had molested my sister and I. She didn't want to tell but my mom got mad at how disrespectful I was to him and I blew up and Told her a little of what happened. . She still stayed with him. At the time i was okay with it because I just wanted her to be happy but now I'm not sure. Ever since we told he's been trying to get us kicked out of the house and talking bad about us particularly me to all my siblings (I'm the youngest of 6) My father doesn't like me at all and I guess it's because I don't play his games anymore.  so now to the most recent events. \n\n.\n\nMy brother and his gf moved in with us so they could move to a different state and still have a place to stay. My brother is close with my dad so to be honest I was short with my brother because he was still friends with him even after he went to jail for child corn about 20ish years ago. (yes my mother stayed with him even then) I got into a huge fight with my brother and his gf because they hated how disrespectful I was to my father and I couldn't tell them why. My father knew this was was smirking the whole time. My dad always liked pushing my buttons and getting me riled up. My mom told my brother about the molestation the next day because he and his gf were threatening to cut me off permanently due to my attitude problem. Once my brother found out my dad stopped trying to kick me out and focused on getting them out because they stopped respecting him. I have an older sister that I barely know because she moved away 20 years ago. I just learned she  was KICKED out for telling the cops my dad was molesting her when he was caught for child corn. I never knew my own sister because of that peace of shit. she had to move out at 18 all alone because of him. My sister thought he was truly sorry which is why, even when we met her 16 years later, she never told us about what he did to her. So not only did he molest me but both my sisters as well. My sister now lives in another state with her kids and some cousins. He apparently touched them **TOO** and his **OWN SISTER**!!! (his sister called cps on him a few years ago but he convinced us she was crazy and I was too scared to tell cps anything.)\n\nEven after all of this my mom STILL wants to stay with him. They are on a romantic vacation right this minute in Europe. I'm so fucking angry. I hate that he's just getting away with all of this. He's molested at least 7 family members that I know of and he  only went to jail for 6 months for child corn 20 years ago. I don't know what to do. He has absolutely no remorse for what he's done and my mom refuses to leave him because in her own words, \"Our relationship is perfect except for this. I still love him\". My mom was also touched as a kid. It was really bad from what I've heard but she still wants him. I am so so so so fucking angry all the time and I can't do anything about it. I can't afford to move and my mom won't leave him. I can't go to the police because I can barely remember anything about my childhood, trauma I guess.  I don't know what to do and I want him dead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of this I've been depressed, having panic attacks, I've almost taken my life a few times and have lost a few jobs because I get really emotional and act rashly. I've gotten better with vitamins I'm taking but it's getting worse again and I start crying randomly at times. I've even cried twice in front of my new boss because I get triggered, luckily  it stopped as quickly as it starts. I hate this, it's humiliation but it's hard to control.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I thought my dad only molested me and my sister but it was more people and more complicated than I thought.\n\nAny and all advice is much appreciated.",

Call the police, make a police report and tell the others that you know that this happened to what you are doing. It may encourage the others to come forward as well. I personally would not have a relationship with my mother if she stayed with my abuser.",

Plus, my sister said flat out she told my mom once or twice. I'm definitely going to get more evidence. He's always recording us with the cameras in the house, but there are none downstairs where my sister and I are staying.",

This man has repeatedly hurt vulnerable people in his life and gotten away with it. Get out as fast as you can then report everything. I\u2019m sorry you are in this situation.",

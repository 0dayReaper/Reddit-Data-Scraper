    "postText": "i have major depressive disorder and go through episodes of extreme depression. during these episodes i don't shower, i don't clean, i don't eat, and i just stop taking care of myself. sometimes i wonder how my parents can see me practically rotting away for weeks and just not even ask if i'm ok or if i need help with anything. they know i have depression so they're not oblivious to the fact that i'm struggling but they act like im totally fine when im obviously not. it's hard to know if they really even care about me because i feel like if they really cared they would at least be concerned",

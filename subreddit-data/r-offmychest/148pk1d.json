    "postText": "My aunt runs two shops that are right next to each other, one is a corner store and the other is a clothing store. \n\nDuring summer break of last year, she asked me if I'd like to work for her during the summer, her fulltime employee was quitting (she was moving), so she needed some help while she looked for other employees.\n\nI agreed since I didn't really have anything to do that summer and would have loved some pocket money.\n\nI HATED IT!! it was bad enough she was making me tend to BOTH STORES at the SAME TIME!! she was paying me a little more than HALF the minimum wage. \n\nAnd I seriously hated the work, I didn't mind the corner store much, but the clothing store broke me. It was mostly old women colths, so mostly old women would come by, and they are the most outrageous and insufferable people I have ever met. Like, they would constantly be asking me for discounts and shit claiming they know the owner, which is my aunt (they DID know her, as we live in a small town and everybody knows everybody) but that's not reason enough for me to give your entitled ass a discount, like they would be offended if I said no. They would also LEAVE WITHOUT PAYING, which is normal for my aunt's store as they would come back and pay later, pissed me off though, cause I need to write all that shit down, and then they would look at me all degected like, it's not personal. Sometimes though I'd mess up and give free shit to people that wouldn't come pay for them, or I would accidentally write down the wrong thing, or discount clothes that weren't discounted cause I'm a fucking idiot, I cost my aunt around 200$... \n\nAll that and not to mention, I'm working both stores alone, so sometimes people will come in to both stores at the same time understandably, it was so overwhelming, just running around between both of them I just wanted to fucking kill myself.\n\nOh and btw, I have social anxiety, it's gotten alot better than the past but it was still alot to handle. \n\nSo, summer ended and I was getting back to school (last year of highschool). My aunt asked if it's ok if she asked me to come around once in a while during weekends to help out, I said sure since I thought she wouldn't call me that often but boooyy was I wrong... I started working for her 4-5 days a week...\n\nI couldn't WAIT till exam season so I can finally have an excuse to quit. Exam season came and I tild my aunt I don't have time to work I'm swamped with finals.\n\nI'm finally free, or so I thought.\n\nShe contacted me again after exam season ended, and I straight up ghosted her... At this point my aunt could tell I HATED THE JOB, but she persisted.\n\nEverything was quite for a while, but I just got a text from her saying that she really needs the help and that I should come work for her... She worded it in a way that makes it sound rude for me to straight up reject her and I don't have an excuse.\n\nI've finished school and I plan on taking a year long break before starting college, so I have nothing to use as an excuse for why I'm too busy to work for her....\n\nI wanna cry so hard rn",

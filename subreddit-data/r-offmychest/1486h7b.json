    "postText": "This school year I got myself a friend group I'm comfortable. I noticed for a while that I got a bit happier with one of them specifically, but at first, I thought it was just because we were so alike. I was in denial for a while, but then realized 'ohhhh I'm having feelings'. I've tried my best to get rid of them, because I don't want to ruin our friendship or make our friend group weird. They are having it rough rn, and I'm not a good person to begin with. And I really want this feeling to go away, but every day it feels like my chest aches for them. We are on summer break, so we don't see each other anymore every day, but I look like a madman checking my phone every 5 mins praying they texted me or the gc.\r  \n\r  \nI'm not even sure if these feelings are real, or if i made them up to not feel so lonely. This has happened were I think I have a crush, only to find out that when I stop seeing them, I don't feel anything. But this time I'm actively fantasying us being in a relationship, going on dates, talking, and just holding hands or stuff like that. I would imagine if we got together, our relationship would stay like our friendship, but we would just be a couple. Maybe I'm just down bad, but I get so excited over little things. When they make fun of my bald spots, and they place their hand on them to cover them up. Or how when we're passing by a crowd, they hold onto my bag or sleeve. We even have a few inside jokes from our private msgs. Maybe I'm touched starved, but I still think about all the times they touch me (not inappropriately cuz ew that's not them).\r  \n\r  \nUgh there's so many things about them that make my little gay heart go pow pow. But part of me is scared these aren't even real, that I'm lying to myself, or worse that I'm fetishizing. I'm a kpop stan and really love that music and the idols (the nonproblematic ones &lt;3). I've noticed that my recent crushes or ppl I think are cute, have been Asian or Latinos. I can excuse myself of the Latino as I am one myself, so I'm just sticking to my culture. But I'm scared I'm subconsciously fetishizing Asians, like my friend is one, but I don't think I like them because of that, but I could just be lying to myself. I'm just really scared I'm some evil monster inside.\r  \n\r  \nI've gotten times where I feel like they also feel smt, but I think that's just me lying to myself. I'm not sure, I've also never had a friend group like this, maybe I'm just affection starved, and I think this is love. But yeah, I'm just I don't know what to do, I'm really trying to ignore it and let it die, but it just gets stronger. I'm so down bad for them it's not even funny, they could ask for smt, and I'm running to give it to them. They could say roses are red, violets are blue, and you would see me trying to change all the violets to be blue. And to cover up my feelings I just bully them, and they do the same. Oh, I just remembered what gave me the vibes that they felt smt. How id stare at them, they pat and rub my head, I don't know if it means anything, but I'd go home kicking my feet. God, I like them so much, but they don't deserve a selfish monster like me. And I really just want their happiness, I want them to be happy, but at the same time I want this ache to go.",

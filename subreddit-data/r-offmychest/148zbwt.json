    "postText": "Been working for the company for several years but transferred to a new store at the beginning of the year when I moved. Well I found myself making friends with pretty much everyone, one I became close with and another whom I developed feelings for (which makes me feel dumb). We both work the same position at our store and have spent alot of time together, we often spend our lunches together and when we go out with our group of coworkers she finds some way to be near to me it feels like. There's been several things that feel like hints or nudges in the direction of \"I also have feelings for you\", flirting, the \"look\", our banter is fantastic, just all types of thibts. I'm anxious to bring anything up for fear of ruining what we currently have but also ruining my friendship with people I work with and being perceived as weird or anything. I've thought about bringing it up to another coworker, the one who I've become really good friends with as they are close to her but it makes me anxious just thinking about it. Anyways, I just wanted some advice on how I should go about this, she's really an incredible person who I'd be ok with just having in my life in general, but these feelings just won't go away.",

If she doesn\u2019t reciprocate, say sorry and then a week later say u have a girlfriend. She won\u2019t suspect that you still like her. Probably bad advice but that\u2019s what I would do lolz. Good luck",

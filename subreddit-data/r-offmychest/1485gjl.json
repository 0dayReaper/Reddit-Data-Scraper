I don't mind if your partner will ask money if he/she wants to buy something but he/she always checks your expenses, its kinda odd for me.",

Are they doing this to make sure you stick to a budget? \n\nThose are the only two reasons I can see that are at least healthy. \n\nIf they are checking out of paranoia that you are spending money on someone else (particularly if you are NOT doing that), or if they are financially abusing you in some way, then that is a huge red flag and I would change your passwords asap and disallow them from this information.",

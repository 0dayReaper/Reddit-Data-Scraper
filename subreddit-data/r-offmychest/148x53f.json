    "postText": "My moms had a very difficult life. She is paralyzed from the waist down and can only move one hand.\nShe's not dying currently that I'm aware of but today she called me and talked to me instead of the usual \"are you doing okay\" text that she sends once a week. I asked her if everything was okay and she said it was. Still, it has me really worried and shaken up.\nI never had the best relationship with my parents growing up but I almost mentally excuse my mother because I know if she had married a different man, she wouldnt have been as hard on me. She had to be or else my father would be abusive. She wouldve had a better life and probably been almost a completely different person.\nI sometimes worry about what will happen when she does eventually pass and it scares me. I feel like I wont be able to live anymore without her, despite never being that close.\nI feel like I've been terrible to her given her condition. At the time I chalked it up to being exhausted and burnt out but really what would it have cost me to help her out with x or y. \nThis was just on my mind and I wanted to let it out, since I have no one else I can talk to about this.",

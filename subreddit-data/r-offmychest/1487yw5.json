    "postText": "My boyfriend never ever praises or compliments me. But rather always criticises me for everything. Whenever i say i beed a few praises he would always say he cant use words to show praise. But he always has words for criticism. Im sick of hearing only negative things about myself. Yesterday I asked him a question as to what can i talk to with his parents so i can get them to like me better but he got pissed cause i have asked it before. He told me i overthink a lot often. Which i agreed but whenever i told him that i need help to overcome it he was like i cant help you. You need to help yourself or go to a therapist. I even said if you cant I\u2019ll have my friends help me get out of this cycle to my surprise he even got pissed at that. \nHe didnt do anything for my birthday neither hugged nor wished me in person or did anything to make me feel special. Its so exhausting hearing only the negative things about yourself all the time",

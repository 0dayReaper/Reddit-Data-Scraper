    "postText": "It\u2019s been more than 2 years with him. We had a horrible fight over literally nothing and he just snapped and broke it off. He then went on to call me a lot of things, which I didn\u2019t expect and found extremely disrespectful. \n\nWe tried to talk thrice after the initial breakup fight, but things got more and more complicated each time we talked, mostly because he wouldn\u2019t take accountability about anything. I felt like he didn\u2019t want to break it off, but he never asked not to. He did say once \u2018if you don\u2019t want to break it off, say it\u2019. But it\u2019s always been me who says things and never him. He didn\u2019t apologise or show any guilt for anything that he said during the fight, he tried to justify it all. \n\nWe said our last words, which were mean and not thought out at all. And then he proceeded to block me from everywhere. (So that\u2019s a good things he won\u2019t see this post). I don\u2019t know how it went on with him, but I spent the night crying and trying to overdose on some medication (as clearly evident, it didn\u2019t work). \n\nWe had planned a future together. I was going to change countries to be with him. Nothing in our relationship was perfect, but it would have gotten there eventually. We were both trying to make it work. And now that he\u2019s gone, and the relationship isn\u2019t there anymore, I feel so lost. I want him back already, but I know that\u2019s impossible. He\u2019s too egoistic to come back, and I\u2019m blocked out by him so I can\u2019t reach out. And even if I can by some miracle, he\u2019ll either have moved on anyway or will blame everything on me. \n\nI really wanted this relationship to work. I really wanted to be with him forever. But the way he didn\u2019t apologise makes me think he was in two minds all along. And blocking me minutes after a breakup just feels like the final nail in the coffin. \n\nAnd now I don\u2019t know how to get over him.",

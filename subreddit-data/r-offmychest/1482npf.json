    "postText": "I should start by saying my father has been diagnosed with bi-polar for many years and has on and off taken medication to help with his symptoms. While he was never physically abusive I feel safe in saying he was emotionally neglectful my whole life. Growing up 95% our conversations ended in lectures/arguments which led me to avoiding him from ages 16 and up.\n\n\r  \nI could list pages of the things he's done to my family and I which has led to my parents divorce and my 2 older siblings no longer being on speaking terms with him.\r  \nA small list of the big stuff: he ranted to my brother and I on multiple occasions near the time of the divorce about how my mother wasn't meeting his sextual needs which later developed into him asking my mothers sister for nudes &amp; hiring a dominatrix physical trainer (Her tagline was \"I'll whip you into shape\"). He, without my consent, gifted a computer to his physical trainer's child which included the monitor's to MY computer (which was his hand-me-downs to be fair). However, I only found out by coming home from school to play video games with friends like I did everyday to see my computer monitors missing with no explanation. I eventually called him for an explanation which he said he was going to buy me new monitors to make up for it but ended up keeping the new ones for himself and giving me his old ones. And finally the event which led to my parents divorce, he was issued a sextual harassment ticket on our counselor ordered family vacation which was meant to help him bond with his children. That family vacation was the final straw leading to my parents divorce. Needless to say, it was a very uncomfortable road trip home...\n\n\r  \nThe sextual harassment ticket was eventually dropped by the 2 girls; however, we all read the copy of their statements prior to driving home and even though my father denied their allegations we all heard him make similar comments throughout the family trip.\r  \n\r  \nSoon after the dust of the divorce settled, I moved out of state and told my father on multiple occasions that if he still wanted to have a relationship with me he would need to keep in touch/call me occasionally as I would not be reaching out. The next time he called me was months later on my birthday to tell me he had eloped and gotten married literally that day, on my birthday, and will now \"always remember my wedding anniversary\". It did sting but I still continued to humor him whenever he would reach out. Its been 5 years since my parents divorce and I think he's reached out to me maybe 10 -15 times.\r  \n\r  \nMy siblings haven't officially blocked him but do not reply to his messages or phone calls. Nowadays when he does reach out, it's in detail about his failing health and how he doesn't think he'll be around much longer (which he's been saying for years now). He recently texted me his life's memoir which he did admit he wasn't a good father and how he's grateful that I don't ignore him like my siblings do. He also included a portion where he explained that he hopes his death \"will bring togetherness instead of holding on to old grudges\". Even though we've tried to reason with him for years to no avail, I responded with an equally detailed message about my upbringing echoing his message of wishing for things to be different. I detailed all the times I feel he wronged me personally, not even mentioning the things I listed above. His response was simply that he doesn't remember a lot of the things I listed, but if he did do those things that he's sorry I was hurt by him.\r  \n\r  \nThe current happenings:\r  \nLast month he requested to call me on my birthday. I agreed and during that call I pointed out that he never really made much of an effort to call me, he 5 years later, he told me that calling is \"not really in his nature and he thinks it would be fun to create a new family traditions to help us bond/move forward.\" To which I pointed out I live 2k miles away and in person activities aren't feasible to me and isn't a monthly phone call a type of tradition? He reluctantly agreed he would try to call once a month \"if it was truly that important to me\". Even though I hadn't cried over anything about my dad in a long time, he said a few things in that conversation which ended up stirring up things I'd forgotten which triggered me more than I realized and ended up involuntarily crying once the phone call had ended. Although we're only half way into this month, he has yet to reach out again.\r  \n\r  \nAt this point, I am stuck between \"why am I even trying\" and \"If he really does die, am I going to regret cutting contact with him?\". I feel like the main reason I still talk with him is out of guilt but I remind myself we are where we are because of his own actions and I don't see him getting any better. It is my personal belief he is also a narcissist incapable of empathy and have accepted for a long time that he is incapable of being the father figure I'm hoping for. I am also reminded my father has disconnected himself from his family and close friends, probably out of shame, and now has no family or friends left other than his new wife and her social circle.\r  \nI know my siblings have their own guilt about cutting contact with him but I don't know why I feel like I can't do the same. I recently started looking into resources about overcoming childhood trauma and have come to the conclusion that I have a LOT of negative symptoms stemming from my codependency including the need to be liked and think maybe that is part of the reason. I don't want to be the villain in anyone's life story, but I know that is just not possible in life and I know being in contact with my father can be considered toxic.\r  \n\r  \nI'm still in search of a way that helps me cope with these feelings towards my father especially when I still have the thought of \"it could've been worse, I was never abused directly.\" and often find myself downplaying what I've experienced and the effects its had on me.\r  \n\r  \nP.S. I do find a lot of what I've experienced to be so eccentric to the point of being funny and I do make jokes about it. The cherry on top is our household was actively Mormon. Both of my parents are STILL active members in the Mormon church. Many of our arguments stemmed from me not wanting to be Mormon from the age of 12.",

I\u2019ve recognized his behavior hasn\u2019t change but I hoped over time we could have a relationship where we could be amicable. Im also just not sure of the steps I could take that would make me feel comfortable disconnecting myself. Do I cold turkey block him without saying anything? What if there\u2019s a reason he needs me? Im still on his insurance for as long as he\u2019ll let me. I feel like I can\u2019t find a healthy balance but he also doesn\u2019t reach out very often. Is this something I can just push through?   That is overall my thought process. \n\n2. I don\u2019t see him being able to provide any type of closure. It\u2019s more so the fear of the unknown of the after math of me making that move to disconnect myself. What information will I miss? I\u2019ve also involuntarily become the \u201cmiddle man\u201d for him and my siblings. I filter the information so only the necessary information goes their way but I weirdly feel like he should be able to communicate with at least one of us but I try to respect my siblings wishes first and foremost.",

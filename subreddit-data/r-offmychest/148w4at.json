    "postText": "He silently went off of work a few months ago, today we got the news that he committed suicide. I have nobody to tell how much he meant to me.\nWhen I struggled with depression he was a person who made days better. The world was better because he was in it, and none of us knew he was suffering. I don\u2019t know how every one of us didn\u2019t see any warning signs.\nI\u2019m sorry to him that he felt so alone. I hope he found peace in resting.",

    "postText": "My mother's health has been failing her as of late, and she has been going through a lot of stress, yet despite all of this, she is still finding the strength to keep going and to continue being the wonderful and lovely person that she is. In the beginning, my father gave off the impression that he was the kind of husband who would help and care for his wife. However, I only recently discovered that the reason he has been going out a lot lately he is involved with another woman. I was aware of it due to the fact that it is common knowledge in our town as well as on my mother's side of the family. The sole reason why our other relatives have not yet let my mother in on the family secret is because they do not wish to add to the strain that she is already under. They've been together for the past quarter of a century, they've been through a lot together, and they've fought for their love. I've always had the impression that they had a loving relationship. I can't do anything about it without causing more damage, I don't want to add to my mother's stress.",

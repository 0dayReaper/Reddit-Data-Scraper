    "postText": "I've been part of this friend group for a couple years now. We've always been friends since we met each other in highschool, but we all became a closer friend group in grade 11. \n\nI'm a very quiet person and pretty introverted. Although this may be the case, is it too much to ask for someone to pay attention to me?\n\nIt's only been recently but since the semesters switched, our friend group has narrowed down to 4 people including myself. I don't have classes with any of my other friends, so I'm stuck with them. At first, I was very happy about this. I really like these people and they're my closest friends in my school. Now, I can't help but feel like an outsider. \n\nThe friend group has become less of us and more of them plus me. I feel like I'm an after thought. Don't tell me I'm over reacting because if you were in my situation you'd feel the same way. \n\nExamples:\n- they had a sleep over last night so they could come to school in the morning together (they don't live near each other. Infact I live closer to two of them than one of them does)\n- they have a group chat with just them on imessage (I've been pushy and asked about it before but they just said I wasn't in it because I had an android)\n- they make plans to hang out right in front of me in hushed voices\n- they stop talking when I walk near them (I've asked what they were talking about before but they've just ignored me. I've chalked this up as me having a quiet voice because I do but it's happened too many times)\n- they'll show each other photos or conversations on their phone but they won't show me (I have to ask and even then they'll pretend to ignore me)\n- they huddle together in a group so I'm on the outside (if we're walking the hallway at school, they'll walk all together and I'll be following behind them)\n\nThere's definitely more that I don't remember at the moment. \n\nSome people may be thinking they're doing this because I'm a mean person. I promise I'm not. They're the mean people. They'll take any opportunity to talk shit about a person. It someone gives them a side eye or if they ask for something and don't get it in what they assume is a timely manner, they automatically hate that person. I've been a part of the conversations where they're talking absolute shit about a person for the simplest thing. It's insane in my opinion. \n\nJust a couple days ago they were cussing out one of our friends behind her back because she dropped out of the limo ride we wanted to rent for prom. \n\nThe worst part is that they'll be sucking up to that person later as if they're best friends. They've only been showing this behaviour recently. To me, they've always been very nice to everyone but now I can't help but notice what assholes they can be. \n\nThere's another friend I have that feels the same way I do. She feels left out as well and when she voiced this to one of the members of this friend group, she told me she felt as if she was receiving pity before they forgot about her and it went back to how it was before. \n\nI've been told that they're planning an afterparty for prom, but when I pushed about any details they told be they had nothing planned. \n\nI've resorted to being pushy around them for every detail to the point it might make them uncomfortable. This gives me a lot of pleasure. If they don't invite me to hang out but they're talking about it in hushed voices the next morning, I'll push myself into they're circle and be like \"Oh you guys hanged out yesterday? You should've invited me!\" I'm deliberately trying to be annoying. If I knew they hanged it yesterday, I would deliberately ask them what they did yesterday as if I didn't know. They laugh it off or ignore it. Now I've started being the last person in the classroom to see if they would wait for me outside. They didn't wait the first time I did it and I've only done it twice. Honestly, at this point I don't even know if I want to hang out with them if it's just going to be full of inside jokes, hugging each others arms and calling each other hubby, showing they're phone to only eachother, etc. I'm just doing it to annoy them. As I'm typing this, I'm purposely sitting in between two of them so they're forced to talk over me if they don't want to talk directly to me. They're showing eachother post on Instagram over my lap. \n\nI've begun to accept that I'm no longer part of this group. They talk to me if they have no one else. It's just sad because I did use to be part of this. They used to show me memes and invite me over and even hug me (even if I wasn't the biggest fan I would always hug them back). I'll definitely feel better once I've accepted this, it's just that part of me doesn't want to because it was all so recent. Literally 3 weeks ago what when it started. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised it this started happening because I didn't invite them to my birthday. The thing is I never had a birthday. I was invited to all of theirs but I just never hosted mine. My birthday happened on an overnight school trip that lasted the whole week. My parents had sent chocolates with one of my teachers and they treated that as birthday party, which is fine it was honestly really fun and all my classmates were happy to get fancy chocolate after a week of mediocre camping food. \n\nMy friends are just very petty. Like I said before, they'll hate someone if they look at them wrong. I want to just steal on of their phones and see if they're talking shit about me in they're personal group chat, just for my peace of mind. I just want to know what they think of so I can stop being delusional about our friendship. \n\nPart of me really wants to confront them and ask why they're doing this and if they know how it's affecting me. My mum says I shouldn't since I'm going to university with two of them next her and I'll need to be friends with someone in such a giant school. She says I won't need them for long but just until I have a good group of friends. \n\nAll in all, I really want to stay friends with them since we have so many close memories and at one point I really thought I loved them. Now I don't know so much and I don't appreciate how they treat me. I just want them to pay attention to me and I don't think that's too much to ask.",

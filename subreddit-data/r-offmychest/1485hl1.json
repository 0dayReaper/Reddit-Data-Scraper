    "postText": "I married my wife about 6 years ago and in that time I noticed on and off that she's disrespectful and condescending to me. I saw the red flags when we were first chatting online(long distance relationship) but I don't know why my dumb a$$ didn't heed to those red flags. \n\nShe likes to poke fun of me but not in a fun way but in a condescending sarcastic and passive agressive I'm laughing at your expense type of way that I find real annoying and cringy. She likes to point out all my faults and defects and makes fun of me almost like a little bully and when I call her out on her bulls*t, she gaslights me and tells me \"relax,you can't take a joke\" or \"I see no one can joke around with you.\" And I tell her \"It doesn't sound like your joking. Sounds like your just pointing out my faults and laughing at them at my expense.\"\n\nAfter several encounters like this she still doesn't take the hint that I don't like the condescending way she talks to me or pokes fun of me. \n\nA few months ago she was changing our 3 yr old daughter and our daughter wouldn't hold still...so my wife yells at our daughter likes she some homeless dog on the street and I called her out and told her : \"There's no need to be abusive and yell at her that way, she's a toddler\" \n\nShe then flipped out on me and went complete ghetto with finger and hand waving and yelling directly in my ear saying \"You ain't gonna talk sh**t to me! Just because my family isn't around doesn't mean you can abuse me and make up sh**t that I abuse my daughter!! \n\nI never seen her this angry and enraged. I didn't recognize who she was and finally told her: \"Thanks for letting me know your true colors. There was no reason for you to flip out on me the way you did\"....and walked away. She then apologized but it felt forced to be honest. \n\nAbout 2 months ago or so during the morning we were discussing what to eat for breakfast. She wanted to use some tuna for some egg guacamole she wanted to make and I told her why don't we just make some tuna sandwiches. \n\nThen angrily she exclaimed: \"I don't want to eat tuna sandwiches!\" \n\nAnd I replied \"I don't want to eat guacamole at this time in the morning\" \n\nShe then rudely replied: \"Then go eat shit then!\"\n\nWhich totally caught me off guard and pissed me off. We then got into a big argument and told her what she said was totally uncalled for and rude. \nI even told I had doubts she even loved or cared for me as her husband because what kind of wife says that to her own man?\n\nShe eventually apologized after that but it felt kina fake.  \n\nAnyways ever since then that incident has left a bad taste in my mouth and I haven't hugged or kissed her since then. \n\nShe even has the audacity to ask why I'm not affectionate and I tell her \"You know why\".\n\nEven tonight she's been rude and condescending to me by making fun of me for the littlest things. \n\nFrankly I'm tired of it and thinking I made a big mistake marrying her. It saddens me to because we have a daughter together and I'd hate to break it off and not be able to see my daughter as much. \n\nAnyways sorry for the long rant, just need to get that off my chest. \n\nI've even thought if someone else comes along and appreciates and respects me more then I might just bounce but that's just a thought and want to leave it at that for now. \n\nAnyone else has a partner that disrespects them?",

It\u2019s my constant goal to make my wife laugh cuz I was the funny guy growing up and to make her smile by doing things every day for her to make her happy, even if they\u2019re little things.\n\nYour wife clearly doesn\u2019t love you. And she DEFINITELY doesn\u2019t respect you as a partner or a human being. In her mind you\u2019re weak, or a chump or Sutton like that. And she\u2019s just walkin all over you like a goddamn doormat. That\u2019s fukkd up man. If you don\u2019t want to have an entire lifetime of misery and bullying from this woman you might want to seriously consider getting a divorce and getting custody of your child. Based on her actions towards your kid, I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019s gonna be a better kind of parent when your child becomes older. Her behavior does not bode well for you OR your daughter. Like wtf man come on. You know what you have to do cuz that shit ain\u2019t normal. \n\nThrow it on rice.",

I wish I could go back in time and take the red flags more seriously and not have gotten into a relationship with this woman. Anyways that's wishful thinking. I have to think long and hard what my next move will be. Obviously it's easier said than done just to pick up and leave but just thinking about our daughter makes me sad. I hope I can figure a way because she is more attached to her mother than me. If we decide to break it off, my wife will want to take our daughter back to her home country.",

That\u2019s just not the same as a lifelong attachment to a parent who treats you with patience and love and understanding. I\u2019ve seen two of my siblings refuse to remove themselves from incredibly toxic relationships and live to regret it later on. One of them ended up cracking under the pressure and has a massive court battle that lasted years and the other is still with his SO and is miserable and semi suicidal (and an alcoholic now). We don\u2019t know each other but I feel for you man cuz I\u2019ve seen what that kinda relationship dynamic can do to people I love. My brother is a fuckin SHELL of his former self because his wife is a nasty arrogant bully who treats him like garbage. I totally get that it can become messy or traumatic but yo like I said\u2026 you only get ONE life. Don\u2019t waste it falling on your own sword because you\u2019re scared to make a change and free yourself from a life of misery. As far as taking your daughter back to her home country, I wouldn\u2019t let that happen if I were you. If your wife is mean/somewhat abusive to your child NOW think about what she\u2019ll act like when your daughter is 11, 12, 13\u2026.. sixteen years old and in her rebellious phase. You think your wife won\u2019t physically harm her? \n\ntrust me man I\u2019ve been in a couple awful relationships before meeting my wife and I remember feeling like there was nothing I could do, so I just took the abuse for years. I was afraid to make that jump because I\u2019d gotten so used to her treating me that way and I didn\u2019t want to uproot my life because I felt somewhat stable even tho I was miserable. This was a lie that I told myself out of fear, and I was so SO happy when I finally got out of that situation, and in retrospect I couldn\u2019t BELIEVE I stuck around as long as I did. That gets you nothing but pain and regret. \n\nAlso not to be \u201cthat guy\u201d but if you\u2019re worried about child custody\u2026 are you both immigrants? Is one of you a citizen of your country? Because if you are a citizen and your wife is not, it would be a lot harder for her to get custody of your child if you\u2019re a citizen.",

Yeah she can be a total b word to my daughter at times, one time she even yanked my daughter because she woke her up in the middle of the night to be breastfed. This was around the time my daughter was around 1 yr old or so. Looking back now that incident was almost the same as shaking a toddler but it was one big yank. I called her out on that but of course she got mad at me. \n\nI'm actually a Canadian citizen, she is only a resident but because she married me. She's originally from Dominican Republic. I wonder how this could help me out if I decide to ask for custody of my child.",

I don\u2019t have friends and my family doesn\u2019t live in the same state I\u2019m in. I really don\u2019t have much of a life without them. My wife talks down to me some days and expects me to be affectionate and have sex with her. After she disrespects and degrades me and thinks I\u2019m supposed to get over it. I sit down with her after the violations and she gets sarcastic saying oh poor man you\u2019re always playing the victim. She confuses me and pushes me away. I understand where you\u2019re coming from.",

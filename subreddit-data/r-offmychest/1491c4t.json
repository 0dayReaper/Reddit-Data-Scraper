I am not very religious or anything, but adjusting my expectations of this life and just trying to be reasonably happy helped me get through the days. I hope it helps, sending love and light.\n\n\"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference, living one day at a time; enjoying one moment at a time; accepting hardships as the pathway to peace, taking this sinful world as it is and not as I would have it; trusting that You will make all things right if I surrender to Your will; that I may be reasonably happy in this life and supremely happy with You forever in the next.\"",

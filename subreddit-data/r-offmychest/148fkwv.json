    "postText": "i\u2019ve begun to really hate coming home from uni. 6th form was so bad, I had no friends and it was just a really depressing 2 years of my life. when I went to uni, I made so many friends, lived life a bit more and i begun to feel the happiest i\u2019ve felt in a long time, but when I come home I have no one. i\u2019ve grown apart from all my friends from secondary, I had none at 6th form, and hanging around my parents gives me a headache after a while, as much as i really do love them. being back home just automatically makes me feel depressed. \nSince going to uni, i\u2019ve also been more independent and finding myself. in that i\u2019ve made decisions that aren\u2019t the best, but are kinda crucial in just general growing up, but I have to be so secretive about it with my parents because I don\u2019t want them to view me differently, which gets so tiring. my mum especially is so overbearing and overprotective. She\u2019s found out a lot about me through my emails (I gave her my password to help me apply for jobs). eg,  she found out my sexuality (which is something I need to keep completely secret from my parents), she saw that I got a piercing through my emails, she saw that i\u2019d signed up to a sexual health clinic. since these, she\u2019s been acting so weird with me, I feel like i've tainted the image of \u201cher little girl\u201d, which makes me sad, especially considering she doesn\u2019t even know all the stuff I keep secret from her. especially coming from a poc christian household all these things are just so much more serious and guilt inducing.\nbeing home just makes me miss the friends i\u2019ve made at uni and I just end up staying in bed all day alone and just getting high. I don\u2019t even really have friends to meet with back here. the people i do have, i\u2019m not really close with them and they have friends they\u2019ve known and been close with for years that they\u2019d prefer to be with and go on vacations with. \n\nbeing home is so depressing. every time I come home I slip into the same negative thought patterns I used to fall victim to. i\u2019ve only been home 3 days as well, this summer is gonna be so long.",

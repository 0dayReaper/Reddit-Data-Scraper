    "postText": "So this is so random but I like to get other peoples opinions when I have arguments with my boyfriend.\n\nSo let me start by saying we argue probably once every 6 months maybe more and when we do they\u2019re just stupid and they go far and he always tells me I\u2019m in the wrong even if I feel upset or hurt by what he said.\n\nSo I\u2019ll try and keep it short, the other day I was trying to sort out the kids pool outside and I had the hose connected to the kitchen tap so the water wouldn\u2019t be so cold - anyway it wasn\u2019t working how it usually was so I turned it off and disconnected it and as I did water came flying out and basically flooded my kitchen, complete accident. Anyway my boyfriends passport was on the windowsill and it got quite wet - he came home and I told him straight away, and as he\u2019s going on holiday with his mates in July i knew he would be angry, I told him and before he responded I also added that there is an appointment in London at the end of June where you go and take a form you\u2019ve filled out etc and you\u2019re guarenteed to get your passport within a week which would\u2019ve been about 10 days before his holiday , I said I\u2019ll pay for the appointment , fill the form out everything all he has to do is go\u2026to which he responded absolutely not why should he have to do that as it\u2019s my fault, and if he gets to the airport and he isn\u2019t able to fly I have to pay for his holiday, to which I responded obviously not as if there is an easy fix where I don\u2019t have to pay an extra 250 quid etc, why can\u2019t you just for one day go and do it? \n\nHe works from home and runs his own company, he can go he just thinks he shouldn\u2019t have too..I work a standard 9-3 job and I only have certain days holiday a year that I spread out over half terms with my kids etc which is why I don\u2019t want too go and it\u2019s harder for me to get time off, and when I say he works from home he doesn\u2019t sit at a desk and isn\u2019t allowed to leave he literally works from his phone as he is his own boss he can go where he likes.\n\nAnyway when I said I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve offered what I can and I\u2019m happy to do this he basically said well I\u2019m not doing that and if I can\u2019t go on my holiday and you don\u2019t give me the full payment back then I\u2019m not buying you a house ( he earns a lot more than me and he\u2019s been saving for a house deposit) and he also said he would leave me and thinks I\u2019m a tramp who\u2019s poor and can\u2019t afford it even though I\u2019ve offered a guarentee fix and am willing to pay for this app all he has to do is just go for one day\u2026it\u2019s so stupid but I said to him I wanted to chat about how some of the things you said made me feel really upset how you would use things against me etc, listen I\u2019m just a regular person who earns the standard amount of money, I\u2019m not poor but why would I pay for his holiday if he couldn\u2019t go when I had offered to get him a new passport ? I love him but he\u2019s just so mean to me sometimes and with having so much more money than a lot of people he likes to remind me how little I contribute even tho I\u2019ve always done my best\n\nOk this was long sorry \ud83d\ude1e",

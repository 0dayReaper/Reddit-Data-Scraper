    "postText": "This happened when I was 18 and in need of a heart transplant, waiting on a list. We were waiting for months. Then just like that we got the call and it changed my life. I was so so grateful to the donor, my mom and I even made our own letters to send to the family but they never wanted contact which I respected. He saved my life yeah but theirs was all heartbreak. \n\nFor years I was always grateful for that sacrifice but even more now that my girlfriend and I met years later, and now we\u2019re expecting a baby boy in August. Also because we know the whole truth now. She never talked about her brother much so all I knew was that he died. His birthday was the other week. My girl wanted to visit his grave because they haven\u2019t done it in a while. She opened up about his car accident, being on life support until they decided to take him off it and since he was registered as an organ donor\u2026 That isn\u2019t what got me thinking though. \n\nWhat did was the fact that the exact date of his death is when I got called in for the heart transplant. Me and my girlfriend decided to find out the truth because her family was grieving so much they never looked at the letter sent by me. We had a long talk with her mom about this because if she\u2019d rather not know then we\u2019ll drop it. Her mom gave us her blessing to find out. Luckily she never got rid of the letter only never got around to reading it because it was too painful, and that\u2019s how we found out. \n\nIt was only my first name that I mentioned but I remembered every word I said on that letter. We cried for hours. All this time life brought us together in this crazy way and neither of us ever knew. It\u2019s too wild. He gave me a chance to be alive to meet the love of my life and start a family with her.  I feel like the luckiest guy in the world all thanks to him",

And I just love how your son will have such a special and enduring connection to his uncle. I can absolutely understand the desire to honor your girlfriend\u2019s brother by naming the baby after him, and in so many ways it seems so fitting. I just wanted to also throw out the idea of perhaps honoring him by giving your son his name as a middle name rather than a first. I do think when children are named after family members, especially ones who were so beloved and now deceased, it can potentially create some pressure on a child who may feel they need to live up to the memory of this person. I wonder if honoring with a middle name instead might offer a little more room for your son to be able to create his own identity rather than potentially feeling that he is living in the shadow of his uncle. Whatever you decide, it sounds like life has blessed you and I wish you and your family every happiness.",

Her father passed unexpectedly, and a few months later, my buddy got a new phone/number. I realized it was my ex\u2019s dads number. I talked to my buddy about it and he said he had gotten some texts a few times from a number (ended up being the dad\u2019s wife, ex\u2019s stepmom) about missing him, wishing he hadn\u2019t had to go so soon. My friend is a good guy and said something along the lines of \u201cdon\u2019t mention it, if she likes to do that to find some solace, just let if keep happening, I stopped opening them when I realized it was a relative of the person with my number before me\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019ll also never forget the chills I got one day when I hiked up a mountain after losing a good friend of mine, wanting to clear my head. When I made it to the top, the only other person up there was a guy. He recognized the bracelet I was wearing, which was made for folks to wear at my late friends celebration of life. (I met my late friend after moving 3 hours away from my hometown) something about having these small connections and events just really made grieving easier for me. I\u2019m happy you had to chance to find your love and her family. Stories like these remind me of how precious each and every soul truly is",

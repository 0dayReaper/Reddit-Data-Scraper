    "postText": "I feel SOO euphoric right now and unfortunately THAT IS NOT A GOOD THING!! It\u2019s too intense and I\u2019m starting to freak out because it feels so unnatural! My self esteem is so high right now I feel like I can accomplish anything, I just want to jump around and run even though it\u2019s super early in the morning. I\u2019m worried I have bipolar disorder my psychiatrist has brought it up. I just feel weird right now I want to run around and do stuff and smile. Ughhhhh what the fuck!!!! I feel so agitated. BTW I feel perfectly rational rn and I\u2019m not doing anything crazy so it\u2019s not like a crisis or anything. Just in a strangely very great mood for literally no reason.\n\nSorry if this post comes off as negative in any way!! I feel really great right now nothing can dampen my mood tbh!!!!",

I feel like this occasionally, I get uncharacteristically social, upbeat, happy, higher energy. Umm it\u2019s pretty early in the morning so nobody\u2019s awake \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019ve settled down because I ate some chicken lol!! Hope I didn\u2019t disturb you :) I appreciate you checking in!",

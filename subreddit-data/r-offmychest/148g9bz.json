    "postText": "My husband has had the same pain continuously for years, classic gallbladder pain, with every single symptom. He is a pretty stoic guy, so when this happens and I see him in the state he\u2019s in, I know it\u2019s really killing him. Absolutely nothing eases the pain, we\u2019ve tried everything while it\u2019s happening, and then modified his diet to suit in hopes of preventing/lessening the frequency. We have a family doctor who keeps saying there is nothing to be done, but can\u2019t confirm that it is in fact gallbladder issues or not. I\u2019ve sent him to the emergency department multiple times, only for him to sit for 8 hours and by then the \u201cattack\u201d is over. They can\u2019t see if they\u2019re stones at that point because he could\u2019ve already passed them apparently. Nobody will help or even try at this point, and he has given up on receiving help anymore. I\u2019m just so frustrated and feeling let down that I have to sit here and watch him suffer.",

You may need to take more assertive approach. Ask for the ultrasound, don\u2019t wait for the doctor to recommend. Ask for the cholescintigram to check bile ejection if you think there\u2019s other issues with the gallbladder besides stones. Find another doctor to get an alternate opinion. \n\nIf all else fails, go to America with a credit card, they\u2019ll remove his gall bladder laparoscopically in an hour without even asking about any symptoms. /s",

You need to demand referrals to specialists.  \n\nMaybe see if there is a gallbladder related subreddit, use online resources &amp; groups to gather more information.  If you march into your doctors office with ideas for next steps, they will more than likely give you what you ask for.  They don't want to think, they want you in &amp; out as quickly as possible, they are often more than happy to make you someone else's problem.  Specialists seem to in better shape then the average GP &amp; will likely help you get what you need",

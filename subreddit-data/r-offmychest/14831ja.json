    "postText": "tw: sa?\n\nI've never been close with my mother. I'm currently doing everything to get away from her as my parents are currently getting divorced.\n\nwhen I was 4 or 5, she called me up to her room while my sister (6 or 7 at the time) was playing downstairs with my dad. she told me she got this vaginal cream and wanted to know if it would work on any age. so every few days, while no one else was upstairs. she'd sit me on her bed, pull my pants down, and put this cream on my you-know-where. She'd apply and massage the cream with her hands or a massager for about 10-15 minutes each time. i dont think it did anything and i dont know if she used it herself (since she was so curious if it would work for any age). I just kept doing what I was told. I was young and I was confused. she would thank me for being so obedient everytime. she told me not to tell my dad because hes very \"controlling\" and he'd get mad at her. she's villianized my dad for over 10 years and is still doing it. \n\nI don't know if this counts as SA. but at the same time, I think it is. the massager looked like a vibrater gun to me.",

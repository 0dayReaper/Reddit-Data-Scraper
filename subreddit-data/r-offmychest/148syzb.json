    "postText": "I know this may not be as serious as other posts, but this feeling is just eating me up inside. To sum it up, I (21M) met a girl last year who was a friend of my brother, I had never had any type of relationship with anyone, but we seemed to hit it off beautifully.  \nIn the course of a few months we began going out, and she was my first everything, I was so deeply in love with her, but I knew we had only a years time before she moved to France for college. At some point I went on a 3-week trip to europe, and she became very distant over chat but told me she was struggling with some pre-existing mental health issues. My plan was to ask her to be my girlfriend as soon as I came back, but we didn't even get to meet before she broke things off through texts telling me her decision was final but not exactly saying why.  \nThe following week we barely talked, mostly about me still wanting to meet up and talk things out, but those texts seemed to die out pretty fast. About another week after, she asked me a question about a show I had recommended to her, and after a few hours she started telling me about her day as if nothing had happened. I couldn't stop myself from talking to her, and we went months talking as if we were dating but with nothing happening, I would tell her to meet up, and she would be busy, and in some instances I told her that what I truly wanted was to be with her, but she supposedly discussed with her therapist and told me no. It seemed like neither of us could stop ourselves from texting and this went on until she hit another rough patch with her mental health issues and wouldn't respond to anything, so we stopped talking for a couple of weeks. A week before she left for France, she started talking to me again, and it went on until a week or so after she left because it was hurting me pretty badly and our conversations became more unusual. But all in all we were in this just talking phase for longer that we actually went out together.\nIt's been some weeks, and somehow I started talking to a friend of a friend of mine, but I just can't get her (my \"\"ex\"\") out of my mind. I saw a story on her Instagram about her going to meet up with some guy and how she was really excited, and it broke my heart. I recently unfollowed her on everything but even still, when I try to talk to this new girl I just default to wanting to talk to my old one. It's just that it all felt so magical when it happened, our dates, our first kiss, she was the first person ever who gave a shit about me and loved me. And I feel so dumb and immature for the fact that I can't get over this feeling, that I can't move on, and that she did move on as if I never meant as much to her as she did to me. My childish brain still hopes the day she comes back to this country (in a couple of years), life might give us a chance again, but I don't want to wait for a dream, I want to be able to love and not think about only her. It seems my memory betrays me and I see her everywhere, everything we did and every place we visited, my brain shows her to me.  \nAnd yes I do go to therapy, so don't just tell me to oh go get help, I just wanted to write things out and share it with someone. I know I may be pathetic, but it helps me to know that someone might read this, so thank you if you did.",

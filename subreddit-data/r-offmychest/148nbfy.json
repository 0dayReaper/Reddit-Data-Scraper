    "postText": "(excuse my English, I'm dizzy as usual)  \nI don't know why I'm writing this, perhaps I want some kind words.  \nI haven't talked to my mother for about 10 years now. Sexual assault, drugs, alcohol, lies, narcissism.. the list goes on. I hate her. I hate her.  \n\n\nBut I'm sick. NSCLC. I want a mother that can support me, hug me and help me through this. I want to call her but she'll just \"me, me, me\". Everything is about her.  \n\n\nI ran away once(several times) when I was a teenager. She messaged me and said \"I don't think this is fair to me. Why are you doing this to me?) \n\nMy birthdays as a child was about her. \"I gave birth to you, so it's more my day than yours\" and she was celebrated..  \n\n\nSorry for the long text. I love you all, you're all amazing &lt;3",

    "postText": "it's been a month since my beloved cat died from an in-born illness we never knew about. I'm still mourning him. and I never knew it would be that tough.\n\nthe best moments of my life are all somehow connected to the short period of 8 years we had this silly little guy in our life. my parents adopted him when I was 14, and we all instantly fell in love with that little fluffy ball with big blue eyes and a cute small pink nose. we called him Felix. and Felix chose me to be his favorite human. we were companions. he was (and still is) my best friend, my brother, my little son, I loved and cherished him more than any other creature in the world. \n\nI had to move away from my parents and couldn't take Felix with me but wanted to take him when I find a good apartment. but a few months later Felix suddenly started to get worse. he lost appetite, he became weak and fragile. my parents took him to the vet clinic and after examination they said that Felix had a genetic disease that was killing him and there was no cure. we never knew about this disease because Felix was always very active and had a great appetite, there were literally no signs of any illness. \n\nI was so broken when my parents told me. the thought that I was so far away and couldn't do anything to help my cat was driving me so mad. and I cannot even imagine what my parents felt, seeing him so weak, watching him slowly die day by day. \n\nmy parents provided our baby with palliative care before they finally gathered the strength to put him down... but he barely made it to the day they planned to euthanize him. on his last evening, my parents said that he was not responding to their calls, he didn't purr, he just growled silently when they tried to feed him. the next morning, they called me and told me Felix had passed away.\nthe call was a mess, me and my mom crying loudly and my dad trying his best to give us some support and saying that Felix was the best cat in the world... dad was trying so hard to keep calm, but by his shaking voice I could tell that he cried too. \n\nI am so grateful to my parents for giving all the love and care for my little baby. they even made a little grave for him in their backyard, with flowers and everything, and gave him a proper funeral.\nbut I still can't stop missing him. I don't feel relieved at all. I didn't lose a pet \u2014 I lost my companion, my best friend, a beloved family member. I know I can't bring him back, I just wish I could kiss him and hold him in my arms before he passes away... I was so far away when my baby needed me most. \n\nit's almost 1am in my city now, and I'm shaking and crying in my bed, holding a stuffed animal that looks like my boy. I wish all this never happened. I want my baby back so much. even if I don't have enough room for him where I live now. I was going to take him with me eventually after I settle in, and give him the best life. now there's only this stuffed animal I kiss on the forehead, and terabytes of his photos in my camera roll. \n\nI look at the night sky and call out to my baby. I hope he's feeling great in his cat heaven, and I hope he sees me and knows I love him so much, and will always love him. \n\nsleep tight, Felix. we will reunite someday.",

I hope that him and Felix are best buds right now playing in the best catnip and purring hard. You\u2019ll get through this bud just take it one day at a time",

    "postText": "I did this without telling my parents and took two after the told me just one. I lied and said that I\u2019m having allergies, and though I am having minor allergies I just want to sleep tonight. I have summer school tomorrow if all goes well and it\u2019s almost midnight. I just hurt so much. I might have ARFID (a non body image related ED) and I think ive been having below 500 calories a day for a decent but now (at least a few weeks). I have a doctors appointment scheduled soon but it can\u2019t seem to come quick enough. I just want help. It\u2019s so hard to eat. I feel bad for lying and misusing medicine but I just want to be asleep and not feeling like hell. I\u2019m writing this while waiting in bed for the meds to kick in.",

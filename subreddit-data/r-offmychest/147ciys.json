    "postText": "I don't know where to begin. I'm typing this as I try to find a place to stay tonight. \n\nI was leaving Mcdonald's earlier when I witnessed a car turn right on red. The driver didn't see the pedestrians and failed to yield to them. They were both knocked to the ground and their groceries scattered. I pulled over to try to help and the lady was hysterically sobbing. I realized they didn't speak any English when all the man could try to tell me was that she had a baby inside of her. She's pregnant.   \n\n\nThe driver that hit them pulled over as well and immediately dialed 911. Seeing the lady who hit them spoke Spanish and I did not, I told them I wished them all the best and moved on. I heard the sirens a few minutes later and knew help was on the way.  \nI immediately texted my boyfriend with what I had just seen. I mean, nobody died, but i've never seen people be hit in a cross walk before. It traumatized me. He gets annoyed when I call him, so I texted him to let him know what I had just seen. Trying to get it all written out I sent the whole incident to him in four texts. He texts back five minutes later with \"Oh my god! Stop texting me, you're blowing up my phone and i'm driving.. i'll be home soon.\"  \n\n\nWhen he gets home i'm visibly annoyed at his response. I don't feel like explaining the situation to him anymore after he sent me that text. I completely understand he can't text back while driving, but I don't think it warranted that response. He could have simply ignored the texts. He gets frustrated that I don't feel like talking to him in the moment and tells me to go visit my family because he doesn't want to see me anymore. When I don't move immediately he starts hurling insults at me. I just say \"Ok.\" and walk out the door. He opens the door as i'm walking to the gate and goes \"You left your food!\" I turn around, expecting him to hand it to me just to see him hurling it at me. It hits the fence gate and my fries scattered all over the ground.   \n\n\nIn that moment I just felt completely broken. I've just seen something I never wanted to see and now my food that I paid for is all over the ground. He shuts the back door on me as I stare at it.  \nI just feel like he lacks so much empathy. He gets frustrated and just steamrolls over anything I have to say. He tells me he wouldn't get so frustrated if I wouldn't be so much of a crybaby for three years straight. I am aware I cry a lot but I am just an emotional person. I can't help it. I also feels like he says incredibly hurtful things that would make anyone cry.  \n\n\nI did eventually come back into the house and we try to talk our frustrations with each other out, but he's now stating we need a break and I need to find somewhere else to stay.   \nIdk what the point of all of this is. I just need to get it off my chest. This isn't the first time he's acted like this and I think i'm just fucking broken from it all. Two years ago my spleen ruptured. I wasn't living with him at this time and begged him to come take me to the hospital. He grumbled about that but showed up. This was during covid so we sat in the waiting room for hours and he kept getting angrier and angrier stating that I am making a pulled muscle out of nothing. (At this point, I had no idea my spleen had ruptured and the hospital failed to diagnose it) They hospital concludes I must have pulled a muscle at work and that's that. (It really wasn't) but my boyfriend is so angry at this point he storms out of the room while the nurse is giving me my discharge papers.  \n\n\n I'm still in extreme pain at this point and have to hobble to keep up with him. He never looked back on me once. When we get to the car, a parking guard told him he was going the wrong direction and he needs to turn around. He gets angry at the guard, curses him out the window, and floors it out of the hospital. Once I was officially diagnosed with a ruptured spleen he was very remorseful and upset at his own actions, but i've never forgotten about that. It still deeply hurts me to this day.  \nThere's been other instances like him getting frustrated that I walked to far from him at the fair and apparently he got lost in the crowd. He pulled my arm hard and yelled at me in front of the people walking by. I felt so embarrassed and and upset from being yelled at all I could do was shake while we got food.   \n\n\nHis mom tries to do nice things for him all the time. We went to Dave &amp; Busters for his birthday last year. He was having a good time but it's like his social meter runs short and by the end of it, he was ignoring me and making snappy comments towards me and his mother. She spent a lot of money to give him a birthday experience at Dave &amp; Busters and he just.. doesn't care.  \n\n\nThere's other things to but i'm so exhausted I just can't type it all out anymore. I am just so tired and sad. I wake up every day in a deep depression and I just don't see the point of anything anymore. ",

You deserve to be treated with kindness, respect, and love.\n\nI don't even know you, OP, but I would treat you with more kindness, respect and love than your own boyfriend. Think about that. Really, really think about that.\n\nIf I witnessed that sort of thing, I'd be emotional too. My gf would probably call off work to come and be with me. Never in a million years would she tell me I'm a crybaby, or demand I stop \"annoying\" her, or tell me to go talk to my parents about it. Those are all horrible, horrible things to say to somebody you profess to love. And then to hurl your food at you?  *How* old is this man again?\n\nDon't even get me started on how he treated you when you had a ruptured spleen. Downplaying your pain, getting *annoyed* that you were in agony... OP, a person who loved you would be concerned for your well-being. Instead, he treated you like an inconvenience.\n\nYou're worth much more than this, OP. I think you know that too.\n\n&gt;I also feels like he says incredibly hurtful things that would make anyone cry. \n\nYeah, he's abusive. Please let this incident be the last straw. I know that sometimes when you've invested a lot of time in somebody and your lives become intertwined in so many big and little ways, it can seem impossible to extricate yourself. But do you really want to spend the rest of your life with this scum? It might be hard, but the rewards for freeing yourself are immeasurable.\n\nAll the best, OP. You are incredibly strong for tolerating this as long as you have, but now it's time to look after yourself and move on.",

In this way, we are a precious commodity that needs to be nurtured, revered, and protectedourselves. \n\nNo one can take care of us as well as we are capable of taking care of ourselves.

You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. \n\nIf the toilet breaks, we call the plumber. If the car isn't running well, we take it to a mechanic. If we are having trouble regulating our emotions, going through a difficult time like a breakup, or having trouble dealing with life on life's terms (life always happens on life's terms) we need to go to an expert on emotions and the human condition to help us sort through it. \n\nWe are all worth whatever resources are available to us and all those that aren't, and whatever effort it takes on our own parts to seek and find healing. \n\nSending you positive and healing vibes...",

He sounds like he has absolutely no bandwidth whatsoever for anyone else's feelings or needs or anything. You don't need to be with someone like that, there are people out there who would give you a big hug and let you talk through it all and let you cry and make you some nice food or take you out or curl up with you to watch a movie or do whatever you needed to make you feel better. You don't have to be with this guy. I know it can be really hard to leave even when you know a relationship is wrong, but give it just a week or two without him and you'll start feeling stronger and happier and the hold he has over you will start to fade. You just need to get through those first two weeks of no contact.\n\nHim saying you need a break is an opportunity for you to get those couple of weeks of distance and to start feeling yourself again and what life would be like without his dark cloud following you around and raining on you! Just take a few weeks away from him, commit to those few weeks for yourself and don't give in, just tell yourself you'll make it those 2 or 3 weeks (set a time for yourself) without contact with him, and if you get to the end of that and want to see him again you still can, but I expect that just a couple of weeks away from him will help you feel so much better and you won't want to go back and your life will improve dramatically.\n\nAlso I'm sorry you had to see that traumatic incident, it must've been awful. Look after yourself and be proud of yourself for being the type of person who stops to help when they see something like that happen.",

Single. Bad thing( no matter how small) has been done with feeling this helps bring all thoughts to the table.

If therapy isn\u2019t always instantly available, seek those friendships who never liked him to begin with. \n\nI myself have had to walk away from abusive relationships, they will beg, cry, plead even change for a short while BUT BUT they ALWAYS go back to using you as an outlet of anger a punching bag. \n\nThey never rarely ever change.\n\nGradually you won\u2019t feel the need to respond to this person anymore. \n\nForgive yourself, none of it was your fault.

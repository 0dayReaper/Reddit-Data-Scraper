    "postText": "My doctor thought it was not for me.\nI'm (F) 35, i sufferd from C-PTSD most of my life. \nI almost drowned myself when i was seven.  Because i feared (knew) things would not get better... and oh was i right.my dad dragged me out of the pond just in time. I wish he didn't. \nI'm only worth of abuse, lies and taking advantage of. It happends again everytime. And down the line i didn't progress in life, but have a whole new pile of new traumatic memories and hurt to deal with. But never any therapy or support from the right people to go trough this. \nThe free mental healthcare in my country cannot provide decent trauma counceling. I heard the past 15 years multiple times that they cannot do anything for me. While they realize that i cannot afford private care...\nThey even refused to diagnose me for years. Because the diagnoses (C)-PTSD would instantly mean i would be labbled as \"untreatable\"... \nAll i can do is let it consume me. And consuming me is what it does. \nThere is nothing left of me to lose, expect for my mind. \nI dont wanna life anymore. \nI contacted illigal groups now to help with my wish. Will have to save money to buy the right drug, which is expensive... \nBut it is the only thing i can do. \n\nPpl, please never abuse your children or siblings. Chances are likely they will end up just like me.",

People don\u2019t understand this is a physiological disease.\n\nIt often gets worse as many are treatment resistant. Only emdr and psychedelic assisted therapy, which is difficult to obtain, have shown promising rates for severe ptsd.\n\nPlease don\u2019t misunderstand this disorder.",

I know what i have to do, bring other people in danger. That's the only way i got treatment in the past. And that still led to getting the same result as i got in the past... more trauma, more lies and more taken advantage of. \nIf one more person is telling me \"we will help\" to sell me a no after months on a waiting list... I'm afraid of myself what i might do... \nThe getting dangerous for others is a game changer for me. All the abuse is turning me into an abuser.\nOne more reason why i made the right choice.",

This could be you, too!\n\nThe idea that no treatment will ever work and things will never improve--you're saying this as if it's an established fact. But you don't know what the future holds.\n\nBecoming abusive yourself is not a convincing reason for ending everything. There is treatment for that too.\n\nI wish you the best and pray that you find healing soon.",

    "postText": "I can't really place this whole event yet, maybe someone of you has had experiences with flashbacks.\nSo last night my boyfriend and I ate edibles and got high (nothing new for us) and then when we were in bed we started to undress and my boyfriend stroked my naked body and called me baby.\nAt that moment I saw not my boyfriend but my father touching me and I felt like a child again. When I realized what happened I started crying and screaming and I couldn't breathe. My boyfriend was there for me and thank God he still is. \nLately I had been feeling more and more uncomfortable with my father and I couldn't figure out why. My father is not a bad person and he was sexually abused as a child himself but I never thought that he could have sexually abused me as a child. I am still not sure. I am currently staying with my boyfriend but I am afraid to go home and meet my father. If I tell my family what happened, my father will be kicked out and my mother will have more psychological problems. But I also can't pretend that nothing happened. I am already going to therapy and tomorrow I will tell my therapist what happened. I absolutely don't know how to deal with the situation right now.",

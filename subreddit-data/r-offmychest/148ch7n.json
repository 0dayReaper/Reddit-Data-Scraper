    "postText": "Met a girl, became best friends for approximately 3 to 4 months, then revealed our feelings to each other and fell in love.\nBecame her first boyfriend, and she is like conservative in relationship matters, as she told me that we should take things slowly, to which I agreed. Things don't feel like we are in a relationship because we don't hug outside my room or hold hands outside we only higs &amp; kiss in my room only.  Feels like we're pretending to be friends outside, but via the phone and late-night phone calls, she intensifies her affections for me, but not physically.  \n\nI always make plans and put forth effort to elevate situations, from friendships to relationships, so that it appears as though I am making every effort. She accepted my invitation to snuggle in my room once, so I suggested that we do it again two or three more times. However, she has not yet accepted my suggestion, and I am concerned about it.\n\nfeeling neglected\n\nShould I explain to her why I don't feel the same way about this relationship as I do and why I'm only reacting initially since this is her first time being in a relationship",

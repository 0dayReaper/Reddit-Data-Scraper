    "postText": "Hello everyone! Sorry, this is a long one.\r  \n\r  \nSo, I met this guy on Grindr about a month ago, on a Monday. He invited me to a bar after a few texts. I was not interested but I had nothing planned for the day so I went anyway. Although, he was 30 minutes late \u201cbecause of work\u201d, I let it slide because I always carry a book in my bag. Then, he finally arrived...\r  \n\r  \nThe date was A-MAZ-ING. We spent several hours talking covering a variety of subjects. He told me among other things he worked as a teacher and now, with orientation on the way, he struggled with a lot of work because he cared for the children's future. He truly was nice, sweet, and handsome, much more than on his profile. I was hooked! He also expressed many times how he thought I was really cute and smart. We both had a great night!\r  \n\r  \nAt first, we had decided we would just talk for a bit, then casually hook up later on, but at the end of the date, he whispered in my ear \"I enjoyed this night so much so I don't want to rush things, consider this is a real date now. Let's plan another one next week. I could invite you to my apartment for dinner.\" I said yes, of course.\r  \n\r  \nWe settled on Friday but he said he'll confirm later on as he was really busy. I agreed. Understandable so far! The week went on, though, and the guy never confirmed anything. On Wednesday, I asked if Friday was still planned and he said \u201cYes, of course. Sorry, I didn\u2019t have time to confirm. I\u2019m looking forward to our dinner!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nOn Friday night, though, I still had no time, no location, nothing. I knew something was up but I acted as if everything was normal and said \u201cSo, what do you want me to bring for our dinner? :) \u201c\r  \n\r  \nI immediately got a text from him \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had to work extra because some parents asked for help. Can we postpone it to next week? You must think I\u2019m *THAT* guy but I did enjoy our first date and I want to make sure you have a wonderful dinner date with me. You don\u2019t have to bring anything except your smile :) \u201d \r  \n\r  \nI was a bit disappointed but he did tell me he was busy beforehand so I was pretty chill with the whole thing. Our next date would be next week. So be it!\r  \n\r  \nAnd\u2026 I waited the whole week and still, no news for him. No messages, nothing. This time, annoyed, I had decided to not reach out as I didn\u2019t want to seem clingy but on Friday though, despite my principles, I still texted to keep the conversation alive \u201cHello! I hope you\u2019re not overwhelmed by work and had a great week! Mine was okay. I learned to play a new song on the guitar. I can\u2019t wait to show it to you someday!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nA few hours later, he replied \u201cHello! :) Great!\u201d Disappointed with the short answer, I thought to myself \u201cOK, he is not really into me.\u201d but then, later that night, the guy called me out of the blue.\r  \n\r  \nHe said he was not used to calling people like that but he was in the middle of a council when I texted him and he wanted to make up for the lack of contact we had this week. We started to talk on the phone and the call lasted two hours. He confided heavily in me about some personal stuff. He told me this week was really the worst and that he was probably burning out. He said to me he had planned to take a week off soon (he didn\u2019t elaborate on that). He also told me I was easy to talk to, mature, and a good ear. \u201cYou\u2019re a great guy, I can't wait to meet you again,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nFinally, it brings us to this week. Yesterday, I sent another text for emotional support something along the line of \u201cHang in there for this coming week! I\u2019m there for you on the phone and soon, I hope in real life!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nIt was a hint so we could settle our date again and\u2026 He only heart-reacted it! Dammit... What drives me crazy is that the guy is sending me strong signals that he is into me and wants to date me, but he rarely reaches out and nothing concrete happens. In a full month, we had like 3 real conversations (and each of them was amazing but still), I don\u2019t know what to expect from this guy. Should I give up? Should I wait patiently for the \u201cweek off\u201d?",

That's what I struggle with.\n\nI don't like dragging out dates, especially the successful ones because the more I enjoy them, the more I'll be disappointed if it does not work out in the end. I really liked this guy and now, I'm kinda afraid, if that makes sense.\n\nI don't like this idea of \"Maybe I have a great dinner date this week, maybe it will never happen, who knows?\" It makes me anxious for some reason.",

    "postText": "I apologise this is long, but I just need to get feedback and vent it out. Thank you in advance for reading.  \nI(F,22) currently live in an apartment with my boyfriend(21) and his roommate(21). The terms of why I live with them is a completely different topic, so not going to go into it now, but I can't move out. Since BF pretty much lived with me in my apartment last year, but technically shared an apartment with Roommate, he never really experienced what it was like to live with him until he moved into this apartment. We are all college students, hence all the apartment switching and moving.   \nRoommate is an international student, but comes from a country that is next to the US. He is incredibly entitled, partially because he was sheltered and partially because he feels the need to be boujee because \u201call the international students are rich\u201d, meaning the students who come from Asia. For example, he refuses to recycle because he \"doesn't feel like it\" and he doesn\u2019t have to because he doesn\u2019t do it back home. He also will leave dirty dishes and pans all over the kitchen, despite us having a bit of an issue with rodents. I can\u2019t remember the last time he took out the trash without BF prompting him to.   \nOn multiple occasions he has also eaten mine or BF\u2019s food, never once replacing anything he took, but the one time I used his pasta, he threw a fit and demanded I buy him a new box right away. He has also had an issue using our stuff without asking and has broken various appliances to the point we literally have to hide everything from him. He started asking us where the things went and I lied and said I let my friend borrow it so he wouldn\u2019t go looking around our room(which he has done before).  \nWe also share the fridge and he has always put things that definitely do not need to be refrigerated in it, basically taking up space that is needed for perishable items, think like candy and dry pasta, but he won\u2019t refrigerate things like carrots. He has heard me speak to BF about it and got offended that we were \u201cmaking fun\u201d of him for doing it.   \nI did him a favour and put his recyclable trash into the recycling and he even got mad that I did that because it upset him I recycled for him. One of the shelves in the fridge broke and a bunch of glass bottles broke, one of which being his rum bottle. Upon realising it broke, he asked BF if the landlord would reimburse him for the broken bottle since it was his fridge that broke. Roommate was not 21 either, which just made the situation even more questionable.   \nOne of the most recurring issues we\u2019ve had with him is that he will run up the electricity bill by leaving lights on all day and taking really long showers, then berate BF and I for \"using too much electricity\" when the bill comes. He has also never paid rent on his own, his parents have always paid for everything, meanwhile both BF and I have had to work to be able to pay for utilities and rent.   \nI feel like the layout of the apartment is also somewhat pertinent to the story, as it further explains why we are mad and feel screwed over by his entitlement. It\u2019s 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, with the larger of the two bedrooms having an ensuite bathroom. BF and I share the smaller room, and Roommate has the larger one since he moved in first and of course had to have the larger room to himself. The bathroom that BF and I share is in the shared hallway and has a shower and the laundry machines, so Roommate has to enter it to shower and do laundry. However, he also believes that it is just as much his bathroom as BF\u2019s and will let his friends use it despite BF asking him multiple times to only use it for laundry and showering. Neither BF nor I are allowed into his bedroom to use the bathroom in the case he\u2019s taking a long shower and one of us need to go, because he doesn\u2019t want us entering his \u201csacred space\u201d.  \nThe rent is paid as a flat rate for the entire apartment, not by room, so it is up to the residents to decide how to split it up. When they toured it, BF mentioned how whoever lives in the larger room should have to pay slightly more, as it\u2019s a lot bigger and has the bathroom. Roommate basically ignored him, since he knew he just had to have the larger room and would have absolutely thrown a fit if he didn\u2019t get it. When they moved in BF paid slightly less rent, which had Roommate throwing a fit because it was unfair and he shouldn\u2019t have to pay more to have the larger room, and pretended to not remember when BF mentioned it during the tour.  \nI\u2019ve really just reached my limit with this roommate and need to vent somewhere I hope people will see my side. I do feel kinda bad with the whole situation, but I also can only deal with so much entitlement from him.",

My entitled roommate used to be one of my best friends too, so seeing him turn into a massive fucking prick after living with him is so frustrating cause I've given him so many chances and told him what bothers me so many times and he never changes.",

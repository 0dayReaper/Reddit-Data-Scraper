    "postText": "I hate the entirety of my own family. Forcing their ideals and expectations on me that I never wanted to do in the first place, so badly that I don\u2019t even know what I want for myself anymore. I hate trying to maintain a relationship with people that never understood me anyway, almost like I\u2019m building the relationship on a shoestring doomed to collapse anyway. Any minor setback is an instant scolding. Being controlled so much that I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m doing is even of my own free will.  So restricting as well that the only ones that are seemingly holding me back from self improvement are my own parents, who can\u2019t learn to appreciate that I really am trying. Continuously playing under the guise of \u201chelping \u201c me while passively mocking me, thinking I don\u2019t notice. I\u2019m tired of finally getting them to understand. I secretly hate every single one of them and they don\u2019t even know it.",

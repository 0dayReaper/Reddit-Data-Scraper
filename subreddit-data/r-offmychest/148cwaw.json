    "postText": "It's not to do with my literacy skill at all. I am drawn into the book yet it hits so many triggers my autistic mind screams at me to put it down and not confront the subject of suicide and how effects people.\n\nIf I wasn't using it for an exemplar in an assignment, I'd be binging on My Little Pony just because my brain would want to drown out anything that would send me straight back to hinking about it. Alcohol can mellow out whatever the hell slaps the panic button, letting me enjoy things that I'd normally struggle to get into because of how my mind reacts to triggers. That's not a solution to the problem though; I wish there was a good solution. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm alone in how I react to a topic I've had serious thinking about in the past. It's so good to confront it, but I've got such a huge roadblock it's a herculean effort to make a meaningful gain from reading it.\n\nI don't particularly care if whoever reads this thinks I'm taking the piss out of something as serious as suicide. I've gotten this ramble out of me which is all I wanted.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been packing his school lunches for him for a year now. Last night I heard him and his best friend talking, since they\u2019re having a sleepover at our house. He\u2019s been sharing his lunches with his friends since their families are struggling financially.\n\nI am very proud of my brother, of course, and am going to make extra lunch from now on so he can share with his friends without eating less himself. But our dad said I shouldn\u2019t waste money, even though I\u2019ve always used my own money to make the lunch. He is always criticizing how I spend my own money. How do I get him to stop?",

This world needs more kind souls like you two.",

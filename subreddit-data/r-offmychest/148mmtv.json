    "postText": "I have never suffered this much in my life. I have hearing problems, breathing problems, I literally can\u2019t communicate properly, the people I\u2019m currently living with are toxic and their presence really bothers me and make smell uncomfortable. I have a stiff neck, I\u2019m only 23m, I\u2019m having memory problems, I\u2019m in constant survival mode, I\u2019m so miserable I wish I can breathe and be normal for even one day. Why has it come. To this? I don\u2019t have friends, I can\u2019t relax, I wanna jump off a bridge or die the easiest way",

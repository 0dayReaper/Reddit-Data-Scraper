    "postText": "A guy im fwb with (its almost been a year now so its similar to a relationship but not exactly) is into photography. Some months ago he asked me i'd like to model for him, he was thinking of doing a project. He wasn't asking it seriously because at that time it was just an idea, but i felt flattered because ive always been insecure about my body and looks. Now, he's finally going to do it. He posted about it pn social media stating that he was looking for a model and if anyone was interested, they should dm him. He asked me if i knew anyone whos into modelling or such and i shared some profiles. He finalized the shoot with one of my friends. And i feel bad that i dont look so good. i mean i understand that its for his growth and he needs someone attractive and pretty for it but i feel bad because its not me. i do not have any ill feelings towards him or my friend. I just keep comparing myself with pretty girls and make myself feel ugly. I kinda wanted him to ask me for it. i know i'm stupid and ugly and he shouldn't have to ask me, but this just makes me feel more unwated.",

I think you have more to you, OP, than a glamour shoot would reveal. \n\nMy 2c: I think you dodged half a bullet with the photography. Now dodge the other half and move on from the fwb situation, seek a properly reciprocal relationship elsewhere.",

I mean, yes people do say looks don't matter but that's the first thing people judge you based on. And a good impression is needed to progress. In the end looks do matter because the society is shallow.\n\nHe's a very nice guy,in fact one of the best people I know. We haven't made any commitments because our future plans may force us to move to different places.\n\nthanks for replying &lt;3",

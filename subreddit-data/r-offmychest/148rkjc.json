    "postText": "     I've just wanted to tell someone other than my direct circle. I was given access to the wages of every director and the CEO. They CEO is making 870% more than the average full time employee, to which they require a college degree. They tell the public one thing, and then do something completely different.  The staff is dwindling, I have quit at this point. But the conditions of the work space are terrible. Mice, roaches everywhere. The halls are littered with hoarded office supplies, all donated and have broken. Some staff do not have desk, and some share. There are people with offices attached to a pesticide closet! Some how, even though the proper departments have been called, no reports are ever filed. The building has rooms with no fire sprinklers, fire alarms are blocked with hoarded crap. Exits are blocked. There was one day the dumpsters were so full (because we only have two and they refuse to get more) that the facilities staff had to stack trash in their office space. This building is open to the public and there are mostly moms and toddlers coming through as guests. That means a lot of that trash was used diapers! \n    I have no idea what to do anymore, which is why I quit. It just makes me so sick that this happy place that is supposed to be helping the community, is actually terrible and the folks running it are getting rich. They don't even work in the building that the rest of the staff have to work in. The numbers don't add up, the conditions are bad, and the people that could potentially do something seem to he afraid.",

    "postText": "TW: suicide\n\nI (43F) was married to my husband for over 15 years. We had two children together (11M and 4F).\n\nHe killed himself in February. I found him after he stabbed himself when I got home from work. I was only minutes too late.\n\nOur children weren\u2019t there, they were staying with their grandpapa. Since then I\u2019ve just been making sure that they\u2019re okay. And, of course, they\u2019re not.   \nEspecially my son, it\u2019s taken a real toll on him, as it would with any child. He\u2019s old enough to know what death means.\n\nEspecially my son, it\u2019s taken a real toll on him, as it would with any child. He\u2019s old enough to know what death means, that he\u2019ll never again see the man we loved so much. My son currently sees a therapist, but I can only afford it for him.\n\nMy daughter keeps looking out of the window at supper time, waiting for him. He\u2019d always wave to her through that window when he came home as she ate. When he doesn\u2019t come she asks where he is. I never know what to tell her.\n\nI haven\u2019t let myself grieve. I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t have time. I\u2019ve got two kids to look after, a house to clean, meals to cook, bills to pay and a cost of living crisis to deal with. I\u2019m paying a mortgage over twice the amount that I loaned. All on my own. \n\nFor the first few weeks I was a complete mess. I didn\u2019t sleep or eat, I didn\u2019t care about my health, or my children\u2018s health, I just cared that he was gone. If it wasn\u2019t for my parents, I don\u2019t know what would have happened to my children during that time. I can\u2019t let myself do that again.\n\nI managed to pull myself together. My children were suffering, I needed to help them.   I had to stop being so pathetic.\n\nI haven\u2019t talked to anyone about my husband. I\u2019m scared that if I open up about it I\u2019ll spiral again. \n\nI feel like after a third of a year I should have got over it by now. \n\nI have panic attacks at least every other day, I never get enough sleep and whenever I do I just have nightmares about what I saw when I got home that day. If anyone around me mentions his death I have flashbacks about it. Sometimes I don\u2019t even need that they just happen randomly.\n\nBut I can\u2019t let my kids know about that - if they see me upset, then they will also be.\n\nI can\u2019t deal with this, but I don\u2019t know what to do.",

That daddy is gone and will never come home again. And it\u2019s ok to grieve and be sad around your kids. In fact, they need it. Don\u2019t forget that you teach them how to handle your emotions. Do you want them to learn to suck everything up, lock it up and don\u2019t let anyone see it for their sake? Cry together, show them it\u2019s ok and you miss him terribly too, that they\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s ok, really.\n\nEdit: please stop thinking about \u201ewhat if\u201c and the fact it\u2019s been only minutes. It\u2019s not your fault, and no you couldn\u2019t have done anything to prevent that. He would have done it in a different day then. You did nothing wrong.",

Or are there any free or low cost summer programs, maybe with the school? Your son\u2019s therapist may also know of resources for you and your daughter in addition to your son. \n\nI\u2019m so so sorry this happened, OP. But you don\u2019t have to go it alone.

I still don't sleep very well. I have severe PTSD and just started therapy. It's painful, but I'm hoping it helps.\nAll you can do is keep letting the waves crash over you. In time the waves get smaller and you get breaks in between them. Keep fighting, give your children lots of hugs and talk to them about the good times they had with their dad.\nTry and treat yourself with a bit of loving care. Hopefully you have good friends and family to help you. Have a wee glass if wine, a bar of chocolate, a soak in the bath. Take baby steps, you are young, you can have a happy and loving future.",

You cannot move the box without it frequently hitting the pain button. It rattles around on its own in there and hits the button over and over again, sometimes so much that it feels like you can\u2019t stop it \u2013 you can\u2019t control it \u2013 it just keeps hurting.\n\nBut as time goes on, the ball gets smaller. It doesn\u2019t disappear completely and when it hits the pain button, it\u2019s just as intense, but generally, it is easier to get through each day.\n\u2014\u2014\nToday marks 6 years since I found out my best friend was dead after falling off a cliff. That is when the shadow of grief truly hit me, and my life changed forever. In the time since, I\u2019ve lost friends to suicide\u2026. My grandma to Glioblastoma, my nanny to heart failure, my cat to cancer. My mom also got cancer\u2026 and my boyfriend is newly terminal in his cancer. I obtained a depression and anxiety diagnosis\u2026. Along with some other trauma diagnosis. In this time, I have seen sudden death, drawn out death. Hope and hopelessness. \n\nI am so very very sorry for your loss. I know that what you are doing  will mean the world to your kids. Keep treading that water and know that one day it won\u2019t feel like you are constantly drowning. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out for resources. In the last 6 years I\u2019ve called distress lines\u2026 I\u2019ve done group therapy\u2026 counselling with 3(?) different councillors\u2026. Today I just started psychotherapy to learn more on DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) but I\u2019ve learned a lot about CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy). I would gently urge you to talk to your doctor and do your best to advocate for your mental health. If you need support, just start asking. Insist if you have to. The last thing you need right now is to burn out while trying to navigate everything for your kiddos.\n\nI\u2019m sorry my response is not eloquent, I just came back from visiting my partner at the hospital. If I can offer you any more advice or reflections on my own journey, certainly send me a message. Sending hugs.",

            "comment": "Please take the time you need to grieve. Even if you only let yourself do it a few minutes at a time, don't try to stop it from coming. My father passed 5 years ago this month, my mother refused to let herself grieve because my siblings needed her and it all caught up with her at once and almost broke her again. To this day I still leave an old automotive show my Dad watched playing in the background while I do things around the house, comfort can come in small packages. \n\nI mostly stopped here to share something I found here on reddit on a particularly hard day after losing my best friend a year after my father. \n\n\"Grief is like tides\nAlright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents. \n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see. \n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive. \n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. \n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. \n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks. \" \n\n-GSnow",

You need and deserve support to process this at whatever time scale you will need. With flashbacks and panic attacks, your brain and body are telling you that you are traumatised. When you feel able, a good trauma therapist can help you work through this.

I had a loss 8 months and 12 days ago and I still haven\u2019t recovered either. There is absolutely no timeline on grief. Some days will feel great. Other days will feel like you won\u2019t survive getting out of bed. Just keep going and do something for yourself every day. Take five minutes to check in or break down or do something to completely check out.\n\nBeing a mess doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re pathetic. You went through an incredibly traumatic experience. I really hope that you see a doctor or therapist. I felt the same way and I just talked it all up to \u201cstress.\u201d My therapist and my doctor now hate that word, ever since I denied needing help so vehemently. Getting help or meds doesn\u2019t make you a mess or pathetic or anything. It makes you a human being with emotions, feelings, traumas. It makes you strong as hell to recognize what you need to make your life better. Rely on your friends and family to continue to help you. A support system is extremely important during this time.\n\nThe biggest advice I can give though, be honest with your children. It doesn\u2019t matter how old they are, they know what\u2019s up. My son was only 4.5 when we had our loss, which both of us were present for, and we talk about it regularly. Talk about it with them. Answer their questions honestly. Don\u2019t be afraid to use real words like \u201cdead\u201d because they need that concrete reality to understand. \n\nAlso, look up the book The Invisible String! It was written about a service family dealing with the father\u2019s deployment, but my hospital brought it into their grief programs. My whole family loved that book.",

It\u2019s been 16 years since my dad died and I\u2019m not constantly depressed about it like I was as a kid but I do have some days or moments that hit especially hard.

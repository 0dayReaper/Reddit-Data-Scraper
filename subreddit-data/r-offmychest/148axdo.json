    "postText": "I ruin everything for myself and my lack of critical thinking skills or social cues leaves me restless like right now. It's 3AM and every bad interaction I've had, or bad thing I've done due to plain stupidity is haunting me. Why is it so hard for me to remember simple, normal things? Why can't I follow directions like a normal person? I know mu parents pity me for it, and it's a even bigger head-scratcher for them now that I graduated high-school and trade school, (low GPA for Highschool, no issues on trade school) recently. I'm just so shockingly stupid, and it hurts my feelings how stupid I really am. How am I supposed to live independently when I can't even remember to bring my wallet to the fucking store? It breaks my heart that I am looking for a job, because I believe I'll be a headache for my future coworkers having to explain something to me repeatedly since I'm a slow learner. I don't know, I'm just upset with myself.",

But maybe there are some helpline you could call?\n\nWhich country are you in?\n\nDo you have any friends you'd be able to talk to?\n\nI'd strongly suggest you talk to a therapist/psychologist or similar.\n\nI know that most people don't like to hear that but once you have a diagnosis or a suspicion from a trained professional you would be able to help yourself by doing research on your condition and learning more about it.\nJust understanding one's own problem can help a ton.\nFollowed by learning about coping skills, ways to work around it or with it.\nPsychoeducation usually helps a lot",

    "postText": "My gf plays games online with other dudes and it really upsets me and I don't fully know. There has been a history of her being friends with a boy who has been interested in her and allowing him to be close to her, and her talking to her ex-online bf who he cheated on her.\n\nShe says it's her hobby and she's trying to have fun but it just feeling like the world is going to end or she's gonna find someone else who she likes and give that person more attention. I overthink alot so most of this comes from that.\n\nWe got into a huge argument recently about me loosing my mind over it and really damaged our relationship. I feel like I am in the wrong about this but can't stop feeling jealousy and hate?\n\nI told her I would stop talking about my feelings towards her playing games and just leave her alone. I feel like it's immature but I don't know what else to do.\n\nI just don't know what to do. I said I would change but I have no idea what step to take.",

As you have said you are afraid she will leave you and go to another dude, meaning you are affraid you are not good enough for her. Once you feel you are good for each other the jealousy should disapear.",

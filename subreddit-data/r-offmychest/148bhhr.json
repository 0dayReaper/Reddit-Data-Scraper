    "postText": "I know she\u2019s a victim and it\u2019s horrible for me to be angry at her, but I am. Frustrated might be a better word.  Her husband is an addict with no job. Verbally abuses her and has been physical. She\u2019s tried leaving multiple times but always accepts him back. Typical abusive situation. She is convinced that he is better and it won\u2019t happen again and they are soulmates. They also have 3 children. \n\nIt makes me so angry that she can post all over Instagram how beautiful her life is and brag about her husband and then when shit hits the fan, she comes to me for help and I always without hesitation help with anything I can (including financially). I care about her and her children deeply and want them to be safe. It makes me angry she\u2019s putting her kids through this and makes me angry that she could be so naive to continually believe an abuser and liar. I wish she would snap out of it.",

    "postText": "I know a lot of people always say, if your friend is in an abusive relationship you need to stick around and be there. Which yes , I get because they\u2019re in the most vulnerable time and that\u2019s all they have (financially too and emotionally too).. but when their relationship puts your life (or possibly your family) at risk, I think it\u2019s okay to wish them the best and walk away from the friendship. It sucks that all it takes is one misunderstanding and accusation to reveal how they\u2019re willing to cut you off. That\u2019s when I realized, their relationship has always had issues. It\u2019s a blessing because I don\u2019t want to be caught up in that. I hate saying that because I truly cared about that friendship and I wanted her to know she was not alone, but I\u2019m still young and figuring out my life.. how am I supposed to deal with that situation when I don\u2019t have my own home, all I can offer is emotional support. But now I realized, this whole friendship, and her relationship could of possibly put my family and i at risk in getting hurt. I\u2019m hurt over the friendship ending but glad because it\u2019s not worth losing my life because people can be super crazy. All I can do is hope she can be safe, im moving on without her. If one day she does want to be friends again, I am not willing to.",

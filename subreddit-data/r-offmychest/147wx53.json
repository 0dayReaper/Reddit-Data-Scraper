    "postText": "I (14F) have a close relationship with my father (51M). We\u2019ve always been close, especially as of late since I\u2019ve started going to therapy and overcoming my previous year long depression episode. \n\nAs I\u2019ve gotten older, I started helping my mom around the house. This can include cleaning the bathroom or helping with laundry. However, the other day, my mom wasn\u2019t home and I was bored, so I decided to clean the blinds on the window of my room, vaccum the rest of the house, and do laundry to occupy myself. My dad was lying on my bed since I\u2019m the only one in my house (besides my older brothers) that has an actual bed. He wasn\u2019t doing anything besides scrolling on YouTube shorts or watching something on Netflix. My dad also doesn\u2019t do any chores around the house, leaving it to my mom until I started helping. \n\nWhile I was vaccuming, my dad interrupted me and asked me to prepare him something to eat. I was a bit annoyed, but I politely asked him if he could do it himself because I was busy cleaning. He dismissed me and continued lying on my bed, saying that he\u2019ll just wait for me to finish. He said it in an impatient tone and I almost felt looked down upon? I can\u2019t explain why it felt so derogatory in that moment.\n\nOnce I finished vaccuming I started crying. My dad has always said that his brothers (my uncles) who treat their daughters as their own servants were outrageous. And yet, whenever my mom isn\u2019t home, he does the same to me. I don\u2019t understand how my mom is so content with it. \n\nI always imagined myself in the future as a loving wife and mother who would do all the housework and work outside like my mom. But now, I can\u2019t help but breakdown over the idea. It\u2019s overwhelming and tiring. And I\u2019m not mad at my dad, we\u2019re Mexican, so it\u2019s a cultural thing\u2014 the women always serving the men.\n\nI don\u2019t know, this is probably really confusing and I don\u2019t think I formulated my thoughts well. Sorry for any confusion, I just needed to get my feelings out.\n\nEdit: I appreciate the people who have reached out and offered advice. I plan to talk to my dad about this soon. Thanks!",

            "comment": "I dont know one woman who hasnt felt like this at least once in their life. I think the first time a young girl learns that a mans needs come before hers are in their homes with their fathers. I knew it was fucked when i had to put my dads clothes (including underwear) away when i was 13/14 while he was sitting 2 meters away from me playing poker on the PC. \n\nPeople will just assume that cleaning/cooking/raising children is your duty because you are a girl/woman. Sadly, thats how most societies work atm and societies dont change fast so overthrowing something that was the default for hundreds of years takes a long time. You cant control society but you can control with what people you surround yourself with. Maybe not with your dad but with future relationships. I love cooking, cleaning, baking, decorating - stereotypically female things. But if a man ever *demanded* anything from me, i would throw him out. Demanding sets a tone of superiority and no one likes that. If i told my boyfriend \u201egive me 50\u20ac for groceries\u201c he probably wouldnt like it either. \n\nRelationships, romantic or non-romantic, are giving and taking. You were giving (cleaning) and instead of him giving anything in return he demanded even more. When you were saying \u201ehey i\u2018m already giving\u201c WITHOUT even demanding anything in return you were met with annoyance and dismissal. And that hurts. Your efforts were not being appreciated and that makes a huge difference. \n\nMy dad likes to complain about my moms food. My ex-boyfriend once tried something i cooked that doesnt exist in his culture and that he was quiet skeptical of before trying but in the end he LOVED it. He was going all crazy like \u201eomg its SO GOOD omg can i have some more pls? I love it\u201c 101% golden retriever energy.\nNeedless to say that i loved cooking for him but wouldnt like to cook for my dad. He was so grateful and in return i just wanted to spoil him more. Ideally, you find someone that makes you want to do these things without ever demanding it.",

Made extremely clear by the fact that you were cleaning when you were bored versus the males in your home lounging around. **But what does it mean to you?**\n\nYou\u2019ve had the unfortunate experience of getting a clear view of how your father views women\u2019s roles. You are on the cusp of becoming a woman. **However, that doesn\u2019t have to be your truth.** \n\nPart of growing up is acknowledging peoples differences of opinion and thought and giving them space to hold those, while holding your own set of morals, values, and opinions. The boundaries you build around your personal values are up to you. \n\nFor example, you seemingly don\u2019t feel great or agree with their situation, and maybe it would be worth a conversation with your mom and then your dad to let him know how the experience made you feel.\n\nThe best part of growing up is getting to live experiences, meet new people, learn new things, and decide the kind of life you want to live. So being **you** is more important than anything else, because you get to assign the meaning to who you are through your lived morals, values, and how you show up in the world.",

Your dad is an example of someone you should not invite into your life.\n\nI grew up with a dad who served his wife and daughter (me) and taught my brother to respect women, and that while a woman can serve someone to show care, so should men. Acts of service is a love language in my family. \n\nMy dad showed me how a man respects a woman and to not settle for someone who thinks women should be nothing more than servants. My husband is very similar to my father in that he shows affection by putting my needs before his and serving me to show he cares. And I happily return the favor.\n\nYour father does not put your needs first. Your father does not put your mother's needs first. Him saying that his uncles are outrageous for treating their daughters like servants is all talk to stroke his ego. Incredibly narcissistic.\n\nI hope you see his behavior and learn what kind of man you DON'T want to share your life with in the future. Don't take his crappy treatment and think you deserve it. Don't think that because your dad is a misogynist that you should date someone who treats you the same way. Recognize it as a red flag, so if you are ever treated that way in the future you know you should leave. Your dad is a great example of a terrible partner.\n\nMy dad is a good man, but far from perfect. He taught me both what to look for in a man, and what I didn't want in a man. My husband embodies his good traits and none of his bad.\n\nI know you're stuck and have a few years before you can move out, I know part of living under your parent's roof is not rocking the boat and you probably can't realistically call your father out on his treatment. But please repeat to yourself \"I don't deserve to be treated like a servant, he is the last person that will treat me as unequal.\" And when you are old enough to leave, don't let anyone treat you as anything less than equal. You deserve much better.",

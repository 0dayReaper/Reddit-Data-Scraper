    "postText": "\n\nI went to a carnival with my friend last night, and after being there for all of 5 minutes, we were caught in a herd of people running and screaming \"he has a gun!! Get down!!!\"\n\nYou see videos online of people running and screaming all the time, but never think you'd actually be a part of something that terrifying. \n\nThankfully nobody was hurt. It was a fight that broke out and a guy took out his gun and started threatening people. But, you dont know this when youre running and people are grabbing on to you. You hear all these sounds from the carnival and wonder if its the sound of a lot of bullets at once, or if its just a ride. You dont know where the gunman is, or if there even is one. You just have to get the fuck out of there.\n\nWhen we got far enough away from the carnival, we were on an adrenaline high. It was a mixture of disbelief, fear, and the rush of feeling alive.\n\nBut today i feel so weird. I called out of work. I feel depressed. Like last night was a bad nightmare. I dont want to be alone, but i also feel like i couldnt have a normal conversation with someone right now either.\n\nI'm sad that this is what this country is coming to. However, I'm happy i got to see another day; i squeezed my cats extra hard when i got home.\n\nPart of me feels dead on the inside, and the other part feels like i need to REALLY live my life to the fullest.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar to this situation and these feelings that come with it?",

    "postText": "So this is my first time posting on Reddit ever for advice and while I\u2019m usually able to manage my emotions this time I think it\u2019s just too unbearable I\u2019m a 23 yr old male and my partner also a 23 yr old female and I had been dating for six months (not a long time I know) however I felt as though she was the one immediately and we instantly formed a connection we even said we love eachother on the first month (I know short relationship that\u2019s moving pretty fast sounds like a recipe for disaster) \nbut it was an instantaneous connection I truly felt confident that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her and I still do she\u2019s funny and sweet and amazing and I think she completes me cause I can be very laid back and she can be a little too serious but I love that about us cause we balance each other without ever making the other person feel like they need to change however she decided to break things off with me about a week ago and it\u2019s frankly driving me a little nuts ofc every relationship has it\u2019s problems but ours weren\u2019t even apparent really they were minor differences and inconveniences like she would sometimes be a little hotheaded with me when she felt like I wasn\u2019t putting my all in things and I would sometimes be emotional when I feel like I\u2019m not being heard but again I loved that about her since I grew up with a family of all hotheaded people which I think is why I\u2019m always trying to be calm and collected and it\u2019s why I feel at home with her since even her issues (which I wouldn\u2019t consider as issues) are ok with me because I\u2019m used to dealing with them, now about a month before our breakup I started noticing that she would start picking certain things that I did that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be a problem with her and she made a big deal out of them (for example at first she started claiming that I don\u2019t listen to her or that I\u2019m self centered, which I was quick to apologize for and reminded her that I always have listened and supported her even she agreed and retracted) and even then I always tried to actually deal with the issues at hand and never assumed that she was just trying to find flaws in the relationship but by the end of it it was starting to get a little absurd (started picking apart our differences which again aren\u2019t that big but more so differences in personalities which I think worked well for us keeping in mind that our similarities were alot bigger than our subtle differences) and we had a talk about it where I explained to her that what she was doing seemed like her trying to find an excuse to leave the relationship and I explained that it might be because she didn\u2019t feel ready to have such a strong commitment or a relationship and I also said that she might\u2019ve been in this relationship not because she loved me but more because it was comfortable that quote \u201chit her hard\u201d and made her think a lot about the relationship cause she felt like I had a point and about two days later is when she broke things off and I\u2019ve just been racking my brain about it ever since, I really love her and I\u2019m sure of it cause I\u2019ve almost never been so sure of anything in my entire life especially when it comes to love but with her I just know that we\u2019re good together but she said she felt like this was too stressful for her and that she couldn\u2019t do it because she needed space and that if we were meant to be we would find eachother again(i think we already found eachother and we don\u2019t need to separate in order to do that) but I respected her wishes because it seemed that she was doing this because she felt like it was the better option for her and I respect that and I\u2019m not gonna be mad about it when the reason is to better herself since that\u2019s all I want too even though I think she could\u2019ve done that even while in the relationship especially since I could be there to support her through it, the reason I\u2019m typing in here is because I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore a part of me wants to give her another week and then talk to her and explain to her all my feelings for her and that all her worries are normal in any relationship and that I would be with her and help her through them whatever they are even if she loses feelings I can help her find new ones with me cause I don\u2019t want to give up on our relationship, i don\u2019t want any other \u201cbetter\u201d if it\u2019s not with her I\u2019d go through any lengths to be with her even with hardships but another part of me thinks that she might already know all that and it\u2019s just that she doesn\u2019t wanna be with me and that if she really loved me she wouldn\u2019t have abandoned what we had because of those concerns cause I have those concerns but I\u2019m still willing to work through them and that\u2019s what hurts the most so I just want anyone to tell me if they think she actually loves me and I should try to patch things up or if it\u2019s a lost cause and I should just stop holding out hope. \n\nI explained why I think she might not actually love me but not why I think she might still do \nIn her words not mine she says that I\u2019m the most genuine kind person she\u2019s met (vice versa) and that I\u2019ve helped her find her love for herself again and that she would\u2019ve never found it again without me ,also what we had was really great it wasn\u2019t immature it was really honest and direct we constantly talked and affirmed our feelings and always talked about the things that make us love eachother which is what made me believe this was true but now I don\u2019t know what to believe anymore if she just wanted space i offered to give her that in the form of a break instead of a full breakup but I was met with silence and I can\u2019t help but think if I could\u2019ve made her love herself again why couldn\u2019t I have made her love me too. I don\u2019t know if anyone can actually confirm or deny her love for me I don\u2019t think she can do that herself but I really wanna have any hope that there\u2019s still something there because otherwise it doesn\u2019t make sense if she doesn\u2019t love me, or maybe I\u2019m not making any sense and the answer is clear and I\u2019m the delusional one.",

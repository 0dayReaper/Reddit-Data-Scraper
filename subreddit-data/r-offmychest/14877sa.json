    "postText": "I'm in my first semester of sophomore year. I have two finals today. I thought my first was at 2pm because on Mondays/Wednesdays I have class at 2, and with my fried brain, I figured I had class at 2 on Tuesdays too. Didn't help that an 11am class I usually have is over, so I didn't have anything to force me into schedule.\n\n\nWell, turns out, as written in my calendar and has been for the past semester, the exam/class was at 12:30pm.\n\n\nI got to the exam site at 1pm and fucking waited outside because I thought another class was taking their exam. I didn't think to check until 1:50pm when I found it weird that nobody else was there for the exam.\n\n\nI sent an email begging my professor to let me take the exam somehow out of desperation, but fat chance that's happening. She's nice but I'm pretty sure it's against some kind of academic rule. It was worth a try. She hasn't replied yet, but I already know it's over.\n\n\nI've been doing real shittily in my classes all semester. Not Fs or anything, but it looks like I'll be getting C+s in all my non-major related classes, of which I have three. But after this, I've lost all motivation to try for anything. I have two exams left and a plethora of papers to finish afterward. I'm crushed. I feel like I've disappointed myself, my parents, and my boyfriend. I want to quit school. I don't think academia is for me. I'm probably going to lose my scholarship next semester because of this (need a GPA of 2.7 out of 4.3 to qualify, if I get three C+s and two A+s and one A- as I'm expecting I probably won't meet that). But what am I going to do if I quit school? How am I going to make money? I've been suffering from depression and lack of motivation since middle school and I think it's finally coming to a head.\n\n\nI feel fucking crushed. I don't know if anything's worth it anymore. I want to die. I feel so ashamed.",

            "comment": "Breathe, breathe. It is one exam, everything will be okay. The exact same thing happened to me when I was in my freshman year of college. I had class at 2pm on MWF and 3pm T/TH. Was studying for my MWF exam and showed up at 3 to take it, only to see everyone leaving the class. Completely mixed up the class times even though I\u2019d been doing it all semester. My professor didn\u2019t let me take the exam, but she took that exam out of the weight and just weighed my first 2 exams heavier. Something similar actually happened 3 times in one semester. I\u2019m in grad school now and laugh at how silly I probably looked sobbing on the floor that day 8 years ago. There is hope, OP. &amp; You will thank yourself for not giving up on the rest of your work this semester. Think about how small one test is out of all your grades in all your classes through all the years that go towards your GPA. Keep working hard for you. You\u2019re not a disappointment at all.",

This has still left me genuinely questioning if academia is for me, but I think that's the result of every previous doubt I've repressed. I'll definitely try my best on all the rest of my schoolwork, maybe by some miracle at least one of my CCs will be at least a B and will save my scholarship at the very least. I'll ask if my professor would be willing to base my grades on all my other coursework if she says no to the \"retake\". I'm sure I'll be able to laugh at today's me years down the line. Thank you again, I'll try to stay optimistic.",

    "postText": "My entire life I've sucked at communicating my feelings. It's something my parents, teachers, friends and therapists have all collectively agreed on. I don't think people realise how easier said than done the concept of communication is. It's so easy to just tell yourself \"just open up to other people, you'll get used to it\", but when when you're actually put in that situation it feels like you cant breathe.\n\nThat's how it feels for me. Every time I've felt upset about something I find myself unable to talk about it with other people. All of my negative emotions get the better of me no matter how hard I try to push them down and I lose control, acting out and pushing people away. Sometimes I just stop replying to people or just become entirely emotionally unavailable, despite not wanting to.\n\nRecently I started going out with a boy and as our relationship progresses I'm noticing more and more that my inability to communicate is incredibly harmful. Like I've said, I've always had this issue so this isn't new for me, but being in a romantic relationship has really highlighted how big of a problem this is. \n\nLike in every relationship, my boyfriend will sometimes does something that upsets me or rubs me the wrong way, but when it comes to telling him why I'm upset I find myself freezing up completely and just lashing out, then I hate myself for lashing out and get even more angry. Ultimately I end up blowing up at him and saying something rude or yelling at him, and then once I've cooled off I just feel ashamed. I know he deserves better than what I'm doing, and he's incredibly patient. He's more patient than anyone has ever been with my communication issues, but each time I lash out I'm worried that I'm going to get closer to the last straw.\n\nI know it'll sound like excuses but I really do try to communicate how I'm feeling and why, but for some reason I just can't. I'm not sure if it's because I can't find the words, or maybe I'm just scared that my friends and family will think that I'm being upset over something stupid. They don't deserve this. \n\nI hate feeling this way more than anything. I want to be a better person, not just for the people who care about me, but also for myself. I keep feeling worse and worse because of my issues, and I just want to know what it's like to be able to communicate freely. I just don't know where to start.",

    "postText": "First thing I'm on mobile.\n\nSo I've posted before about the relationship I had with my father, how he was my best friend, and confidant. Now my greater family is a bit of weird thing. \n\nGrowing up my parents would regale about how tight knit their families were, how they were kids that saw everyone weekly, sometimes multiple times a week. But as they grew up those times have ceased to be but just special occasions. Then when my generation started to be born, everyone was scattered to the winds. So the tales they told with such fondness I guess took root, but never bloomed. As I loved being around my cousins, aunts, uncles, and grand parents, but I was also keen on being on my own. The independent streak I guess. \n\nFast forward 20 plus years of working jobs that you never had holidays off, I missed so much time with them. Now when we have the meet ups that may happen once every few years, it's like your a stranger in a strange land. As I'm the only one who isn't married, or has children. I love my family, but i don't feel a connection with them, or am I just over thinking this whole thing.",

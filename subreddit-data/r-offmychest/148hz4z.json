    "postText": "I am completely lost right now.\nI left my partner on Sunday after six years, I was living at his house so I moved to a hotel. Got a room until Saturday.\nI'm away from my family and my country. My friends live far away too.\nI need to stay in this country until December because of work, but I just don't know what to do, neither in the meantime or after that.\nI'm trying to find a place to live, but I keep breaking down at the thought of not going back home. \nI don't know if I want to stay in this country or go back to mine with my family.\nI don't know anything and I don't want to constantly bother my friends through text as they have their own worries and busy lives.\nI just... don't know.\n\nI haven't been in a break up before, so I am also trying to learn how to deal with that at the same time as trying to figure out the rest of my life and I just can't.",

I know it isn\u2019t easy what you are going through, and you are going to get through this. What are your options currently for living in the country you are in, and what are the options for going back home?",

I have time to decide if I want to continue here or not, but I just feel a bit shit about everything at the moment so I'm literally just sitting in my hotel room staring at my bags on the floor.\n\nCheerful, I know, but that is my mental state right now.\n\nI have spoken with a friend for a bit, so that helped =)",

Why don't you text a good friend or family member to see if they have time to talk on the phone? \n\nNo need to figure out the whole rest of your life. Think it over each day and you'll come to the right decision soon enough. Maybe you'll quit your job and move back to your country, maybe you'll stay for a while. I wish you success with everything!",

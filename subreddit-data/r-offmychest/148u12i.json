    "postText": "I got this amazing opportunity for an internship of my dreams. I just started recently a week ago and well. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m preforming as well as I should. For context I\u2019m a graphic designer, so i was hired for my ability and portfolio. So far i have definitely not shown my best, i\u2019ve been trying but i don\u2019t know what\u2019s blocking my mind off. \n\nI feel absolutely terrible and feel like i let my manager down since they hired and really believed in me. They are also very kind to me but i know i haven\u2019t been performing up to par :(.\n\nI know the only thing i can do now is try and bring my best and learn but i just feel extremely untalented and unskilled. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m unable to make good designs when it is so extremely crucial right now. I really REALLY want to stay on board for the fall too, since i\u2019m just a summer intern right now. I feel i\u2019ve already messed up my chances.\n\nI wish i could try it again from the beginning. I feel like i could have prevented this somehow but i don\u2019t know. \n\nMy cat of 18 years died a month ago, which was very hard and i do feel i have slightly not been the same since but i feel like this is just an excuse i\u2019m making for myself.\n\ni feel terrible knowing that i really haven\u2019t been bringing the quality i\u2019m expected to and don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m ashamed of myself. I worked my hours for today if i\u2019m going to try and work a little more because i really want to turn this around and bring some better quality work tomorrow.",

            "comment": "... I will need you to re-read your post. Veeeeeeeeeery slowly.\n\nYou started... as an intern.... a week ago.\n\nIntern... one week.\n\nNo one remotely intelligent expect their INTERN to perform like a superstar after ONE WEEK. Hell, no one expect their full-time newly hired senior to perform like a superstar after one week.\n\nRelax. I am sure you are doing great. No one expect you to be perfect. You are there to learn : not to take all responsibilities on your shoulder and execute them like you were a senior.\n\nIf your performances are really worrying you, I strongly suggest you do a quick check-in with your internship manager to know what are his expectations and how you can improve. \n\nGood luck. I am sure you'll do great :)",

I guess i just have high expectations of myself. And yeah i\u2019ll discuss my performance with my manager if i continue feeling this way. And you\u2019re right about this being a learning experience too !",

    "postText": "I was seeing this guy for a little bit that I really liked, we were part of this big work friend group. He initiated things with me first and then ended things with me by being a jerk. It really fucked me up because I liked him so much and really wanted us to be together, and he was so rude to me during and after the breakup. My lady friends in the group all remained friends with him after that. I didn't tell them not to stay friends with him, but I expected them to stand with me since it's kinda \"girl-code\" to do that, and they were better friends with me than him. They all knew how much I liked him and even helped us get together, so when he broke my heart and mistreated me, I thought they would be mad at him. It just really hurts me that they really didn't seem to care.",

    "postText": "Who would've thought my first heartbreak would hurt me this much...I was blindsided by being dumped by my first boyfriend last year (we had been together for 11 months). With his reasons not making sense and for just bringing them up to me as he's breaking up with me. That was shocking to me because everything seemed to be okay up until that point. It\u2019s been months since the break up and I\u2019m still having a hard time getting over him. I\u2019ve dated a few guys since then but have felt no connection with them, so I\u2019m starting to feel frustrated and sad from missing our connection/relationship.  \n\n\nDoes this ever get better? Do I just have to let the time heal me, because I'm tired of feeling like this?",

            "comment": "Yes. It will get better. You're mourning a loss. Everyone mourns a loss at some point, and everyone goes through that in their own fashion. Mourning comes in waves, at first, it hurts really bad, but as time passes, you will get more and more good days between the bad days.\n\nIt's okay to feel whatever you need to feel. Get it out of your system. Write, yell, sing, walk, whatever.\n\nTake good care of yourself. Regardless of who you are with, remind yourself that you are numero uno. Get enough sleep, read, eat, drink water, exercise, get outside, connect with friends, travel,... the works. Really important.\n\nSure, you could force yourself to date around. But the best dates will come once you stop forcing and you live life to your fullest for your own sake. Yeah, I know that sounds clich\u00e9, but try to reflect on who you were before you met your ex and how you ended up with him.",

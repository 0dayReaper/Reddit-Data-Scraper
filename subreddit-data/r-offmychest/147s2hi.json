    "postText": "I worked really hard to lose weight the past few years and I finally reached my ideal body and got the confidence I wanted to approach women. It\u2019s not even just losing weight, because I\u2019ve taken time and money to elevate everything about myself including outfits, colognes, jewelry and even growing my hair out. I get compliments all the time from my friends and family, and I know they\u2019re being nice but I also know it\u2019s genuine too because they see the improvements I\u2019ve made. \n\nHowever, despite all this, women don\u2019t like me. I don\u2019t know what it is because I\u2019ve had successful approaches where I get girls numbers and even go on dates/hang out with them and we legitimately have a good time. Then next thing I know is they ghost me or delete me off their snap/Instagram and sometimes just straight up delete my number. This one girl who I hung out with twice now said \u201cwho is this\u201d after I texted her and I don\u2019t know what I even did for my contact to get deleted because we had made plans to get lunch for a second date already and then I\u2019m just a nobody. This has happened multiple times now and it\u2019s ruining my self esteem and overall confidence. \n\nI don\u2019t think my mental health can handle this anymore. I understand if a girl isn\u2019t interested that\u2019s completely fine everyone has their own taste. What I don\u2019t understand is how I can have a good time with these girls, they continue to talk to me after, and then they just cut me off like I\u2019m a nobody. I\u2019d rather they just reject me then cut me off like that because then you at least get closure. So for now I\u2019m going to give up on dating and just continue to work on myself and my career because I\u2019m just tired of being treated like this. I didn\u2019t work hard to gain all this confidence just for it to get destroyed like this so I think it\u2019s best to just continue to work on myself so I don\u2019t fall into rock bottom.\n\nTl;Dr getting ghosted multiple times sucks",

Try to be as honest as possible,  Do you try to just show off, do you pretend to be more than you actually are, do you talk a lot about yourself? Usually what topics do you try to talk about? Do you think you sound desperate when you talk to them?\n\nAlso, what is the reason you are meeting them? To have a serious relationship or just a one-night stand?\n\nDo you have any clues about what you think should be scaring them off?",

I usually try to talk about what hobbies they like or what they studied in school, usually just general things like that. \n\nI\u2019m not a one night stand person. I won\u2019t sleep with someone unless I have feelings for them and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be after a first date unless the chemistry is just realllyyyy there. Tbh I think I may actually sound desperate when I talk to girls. Not in a \u201cpls date me plssss\u201d way but maybe more so I\u2019m just too eager and excited to get a date or second date planned, and now that I think about it I can see how this can turn some women off. Maybe in the future I can make more of an effort to come off being more relaxed and chill rather than shy and desperate.",

I can definitely relate to your position of receiving compliments, getting first dates but then things just oddly fizzling out with no explanation. But with my current partner of four years, I've learned about SOOOOO many odd traits about myself that I've learned to control, I have honestly no idea which traits specifically put my past partners off haha! The good news is, there are women out there who will stick around despite your potentially-off-putting quirks long enough for you to have the \"Oh, I do that?\" moment and then you can patch the issue.",

Last time someone did that, became the one and only time I\u2019ve had to call the police on a stalker.  I was in the middle of an investigation for my new job and I believe this incident is why I didn\u2019t get the position I applied for.  They decided that since he violated my boundaries at work, and I needed to pull in office security, that I had shown bad judgment.\n\nIt makes me feel uncomfortable and manipulated and I start going through how much info does this person have about me right now? I hope he doesn\u2019t have my real number or address\u2026 some people will definitely make that second date just to appease out of the situation and then cancel  later when they feel safer.  At least I cancel.  But after that it\u2019s time for block/ignore.\n\nYou want to give people enough space to process what happened on the first date and consider whether or not they want a second.  If you don\u2019t allow that space to make their own decision, and instead pressure for your desired outcome instead, then they hear that no is not an option for you and that can lead to all kinds of problems.\n\nA person reveals a lot of their character in how they respond to a no they didn\u2019t necessarily want to hear. Your approach appears to be to pressure and manipulate the before the question is even asked.  When I\u2019m on the other end of that, I\u2019m gonna run.",

Especially if you are total strangers to each other.,as If you're using apps to match, etc, it might be a cautionary steps on their part.so not about YOU, but how your actions can make them feel.\n\nMy tip would be to act cool, be patient, let yourself and her to actually get to know each other.. and graduallyyyyyy reflect if you could be a good match. Don't mention if you are super excited to her if this is still too early on. You don't know her after all either.. Give space to her and to yourself. Enjoy the process. Don't rush anything at all. Let the flow direct you.. let her know you and you kinda can pick on hints if she actually likes you or not. Don't worry. You'll be fine. \n\nGood luck!!! Its okay. you're gonna find your better half sooner or later. in the meanwhile, have fun, be curious, and enjoy your new love adventures:)",

Not just romantically either. \n\nLiterally, I started playing Pok\u00e9mon Go, made a whole bunch of friends, and while helping one of those friends move house, I met my current partner. We've been together 3 years. While I'm not 100% where I want to be with my body weight, he likes me for who I am. You'll find a person who likes you for who you are too. It'll literally happen when you least expect it. Ghosting is awful, but so predominant now, because we live in a society that makes it easy. But honestly, sometimes it's hard to tell someone you're not interested either. I went on a few dates with a guy, a while back, but felt completely unattracted to him. It wasn't his fault in any way. But when I tried to let him down gently, he got super angry. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say here, is that it may not have anything to do with you in general, at least in some of these ghosting cases. The girl may have just felt extremely anxious. I do however agree that it sucks to ghost people. \n\nHopefully, some of my rambling has helped you a little. I wish you good luck, no matter where your life path takes you.",

I\u2019m in my late 40\u2019s and the dating game has changed dramatically since I was in the game. What I can tell you is that when I was having a barren spell with the opposite sex I could be single for ages and then about a week or two after going steady with someone and making it official I\u2019d be inundated with girls coming up to me saying shit like \u201cI\u2019ve always liked you\u201d etc. I mean like what the hell. \n\nHonestly if you want to find the right one, then I highly recommend just being you. The harder you work at it the less successful you will be. You can try to get yourself in the image of what you think will succeed as much as you want, but I\u2019d that going to be the real you?  I\u2019ve been told many times that what women (if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for) find attractive is a confident, genuine, person who can make them laugh. Oh and be able to laugh at yourself. \n\nRejection is the hardest emotion to deal with, for anyone, and everyone has their own insecurities.  \n\nThe one who asked you \u201cwho is this\u201d when you messaged her isn\u2019t worth getting upset about. She may have had a genuine reason for not knowing who you are. The reason for not remembering who you are could be totally different to what you think they were. Respond with the guessing game. \n\nDon\u2019t give up on love. It will find you when you least expect it.  Get, yourself out in the world, join social networks and maybe step out of your comfort zone once in a while. I highly recommend travelling the world. \n\nAnd what experience do I have?  I\u2019m an absolute dick who managed to find a complete gem. When I was least expecting it. \n\nChin up my man. I have faith in you.",

So, girl's perspective: I had lots of coffee dates, most of them were ok, but they just did not click, there was no spark. It was not connected to how the guy looked (pictures were exchanhed before), setting of the date or any taught patterns of behaviour some people suggest here (like not texting te girl right away after the date - why not?). You just feel something or not. \n\nAnyways: After the first coffee date I'd thank the guy for the meeting and let him know that I do not see the second one happening. And you might say: yes, that's what I want, just to have a clear situation and to move on. Unfortunately there are many men that tend to think this message (or even in person communication) means that they have a chance to convince me otherwise. And then the nagging starts. 'But why not? What was wrong? Thought we had a nice chat! Let's see each other again! You cannot not have a reason, is it because /insert something ridiculous/ you must be dating someone else...'. etc. The nagging continued usually as long as I was civil and nice about it. One guy wrote me poems every day for a month (after 1h meeting) and being repeatedly told that hey, that's sweet and somebody will appreciate it but not me, please stop. One called me and wrote long messages complaining that he did not sleep well before the date so now he is entitled to a re-do..., one even told me that I'm leading him on by politely responding to his tries (I shit you not: 'you say you do not want to meet again, but you are responding, so there must be something to it! I'll wait...). \n\nI also had a few second dates with not so crazy people and I've been ghosted myself twice. \n\nMy last online date was my current fiance, we bought a house together and we are getting married in two months \ud83d\ude0a. So, not all people on the apps are crazy or rude, but even 30% of super crazy guys can teach the girls to be rude and then the rude girls can make you loose hope. \n\nI've never personally ghosted anybody, but also I often found myself regretting I did not. I was on an app for only 1 month, I can imagine by month 3 I'd become a ghoster. I am truly sorry that this is what society looks like right now and very happy to be out of this madness. \n\nBest of luck to you, anybody that ghosted you would be a waste of time anyways. If you like a girl suggest/ joke about the second date while being on the first one. If she likes you too it will not put her off. Follow up with a text the next day. If there is no spark no amount of waiting cool game will help you. If there is a spark you can act silly and it will be read as cute. Remember it's just a short talk with a stranger. Nothing serious until it becomes serious \ud83d\ude09",

But it actually ended up being really fun and enjoyable and I learned a lot about myself. I took these skills back home with me and I go out alone frequently, and it has made me a lot more friends than going out in groups.

Dating is a horrible game honestly, I have been ghosted many times with no reasoning as to why either in the past (it would help to know if it's something we can improve on or just incompatible but it happens). Have been rejected a lot first time hurts but after a while I cared less. One guy even rejected me because I was a virgin got depressed because I thought that's what men want, now I don't care about trying to please others just trying to find the one for me :).\n\nI used to get incredibly insecure because I had the mindset that I'm trying to appeal to a guy, but now I reflected on my values/morals and what I want for myself too not just what the other person wants. After that I experienced more long term happier relationships. It is a numbers game, don't take it to heart, and because it didn't work out doesn't mean you don't have value.",

I love a lot of nerdy shit and I can go on for hours about stuff like Elderscrolls lore, transformers lore, halo lore,, pokemon lore, etc., whatever anime or game I am currently playing, a movie I just watched, you get the point, plenty of people might be put off by that but my GF likes when I go off cause she likes seeing how passionate I am about this stuff. Some people only like you to be passionate about stuff they see as \"adult hobbies\", so if you are like me then just keep being yourself, I think you just haven't found the right person.\n\nAs an example, the other day I went on a rant about how I found a square car we drove past to be a stupid ass shape cause its not aerodynamic and she found it funny and fun that it made me unreasonably upset.",

An example of a conversation I had was this girl told me she liked to read and I asked what type of books she liked reading and if she had any recommendations and I mentioned I liked manga and joked if that counts as real reading and she laughed and was like haha no it's not the same and usually that's how my conversations go with any topic really",

I don't actively seek dates like I don't go out in public with the sole purpose of finding a woman to ask out, I do it by chance. For instance, the last girl's number I got was a girl who works out at my gym and I Saw her out in public one time, so I approached and was successful and got her number. We had a gym date since that's how we kind of knew each other so we worked out together and I thought it went really well she was really giggly and we had a good time and a great workout. Then later we were texting and we were trying to plan the next date, but then she just ghosts me.  A week went by so I texted her \"hey\" and this was the one who said \"who is this\" so that was a big ouch moment lmao. But generally I meet women either randomly through school or through mutual friends",

Its great when you 2 have been dating awhile but as a first date I dont think it was a good idea but everyone is different so I could always be wrong on that. It does, however, remind me of the anime \"love after world domination\" (essentially red power range falls in love with evil villianess and they are both awkward and meat heads, really cute and sweet anime, also kinda funny), the episode about their first date is a great one because its about how what others might find as a bad or abnormal first date, might be the PERFECT first date for you and the one you love.",

It will allow you to understand better how the society shapes women. Something that sounds totally innocent to you might sound completely different to them.

What no one seems to tell you when you\u2019re young is rejection is as much a part of life as is sleep or breathing air.  Rejection hurts, whether you don\u2019t get picked for something, a job rejection or in relationships.  I can\u2019t begin to understand why, but some people have to deal with rejection more than others.  Some people have it easier in getting jobs or jumping from a relationship to a relationship.  Whereas, people like you and I deal with rejection when it just doesn\u2019t make sense.  The best advice I can give you is the same thing I\u2019m doing myself which is stop looking altogether and live your life.  There\u2019s a lot of things you can\u2019t control.  You can\u2019t control what\u2019s going on in another human being\u2019s life.  You can\u2019t control if they accept you or not.  So, instead focus on what you can control.  Focus on continuing to do what you\u2019re doing which is bettering yourself.  Learn a new skill, go out hiking, go on vacations, do things you\u2019ve always wanted to do.  Live a life that allows you to stop focusing on your problems.  You\u2019d be amazed how good it feels to get out there and even do something as small as going to the park and just enjoying nature.  Make good memories you can remember and appreciate and be grateful for your blessings like your career.  When you do these things, you\u2019ll realize that you can be happy even if a partner comes along or not.  At the very least, you\u2019ll have so much to share with someone if they come along.  And if they don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be too busy living your life to be consumed with what you don\u2019t have.  Make the choice to live life fully and be happy and grateful.",

The likely reason why they ghosted you was probably because they were using you to not get bored, but when they had their fill, they threw you under the bus.

Im naturally long winded so I\u2019ll attempt brevity.  If you have questions ask.\n\n1.  Ensure hygiene is not an issue, breath, body odor clean clothes, greasy hair.\n\n2. Ghosting is the safest way for a woman to break contact.   If she does it simply move on and if you see her wish her \n\n3.  If searching for romance simply do not agree to just be friends or maintain contact.  End it with a simple it was nice meeting you and smile!  Don\u2019t let her know if you\u2019re angry or annoyed.\n\n4. Women can tell if you\u2019re too eager.   Don\u2019t worry about whether or not they like you as much as if you like them.  Ask yourself seriously if you enjoyed talking with them.  Would you have enjoyed speaking to them if they were ugly?  If yes then move on.\n\n5. Avoid self depreciating jokes/comments.  Ok to laugh at a jab about yourself as long as you give back- especially about stupid things that don\u2019t matter like hat size, hand size, shoelace, keep it light and ridiculous.  Make a joke instead about how you\u2019re so handsome the male waiter keeps hitting on you. If you don\u2019t like you she won\u2019t either. \n\n6.  Practice three default jokes and 3 stupid magic tricks /bar tricks.  Don\u2019t laugh or smile at your own jokes until they land.\n\n7.  Do you have a stupid laugh?  Don\u2019t be too eager or too loud.\n\n8. Take up MMA/boxing/kick boxing/Judo/BJJ.  Don\u2019t take anything else.  The confidence you will gain over a year in any of these sports is subconsciously projected and perceived by others.\n\n9.  Don\u2019t be a mouth breather \n\n10.  If you are talking more than her ask her the same questions she asks you.   Read the book \u201cHow to win friends and influence people \u201c\n\n11.  Don\u2019t over share your problems especially at first wait until you\u2019ve known them for a month or so before throwing any huge life experience thing at them. \n\n12.  Don\u2019t be overly hyper or eccentric like laughing at everything or being deadpanned stoned or too drunk.  \n\n13   Google 10 social behaviors that make you look weird and begin practicing them.\n\n14.  Limit yourself to two alcoholic beverages per date.   Don\u2019t get drunk and don\u2019t try to peer pressure alcohol onto her- if you ask if she wants to do shots and she says no then don\u2019t make a big deal of it but consider changing your shot to a beer instead.\n\n15. Ask yourself again if you enjoyed talking to her and would you have enjoyed it if she was ugly.  Dates are designed to see if there is common ground.  Just because someone shows interest doesn\u2019t mean you should date them if you didn\u2019t find them interesting and fun to talk to.\n\n16.  Most importantly - Don\u2019t be a serial killer.  If you are then turn yourself in.  Besides the police probably won\u2019t even believe you.   \n\n\n\nWith these helpful tips you\u2019ll be well on your way to meeting a woman worth dating.   Good luck!",

Try making friends with women you don't want to date, see things from their perspective, go out and get into social groups with people and focus on that part of your life before trying to date.\n\nI'm also not a one night stand person, but I think taking the time to get to know yourself helps you deal with getting back out there. It can be super tough on the best of us! Everything I'm saying is all stuff I'm doing right now, working on my physical and mental health and kept away from relationships for 3yrs (you don't have to be as drastic as me lmao, im a hopeless romantic so ive ended up looking past soooo many red flags) \n\nYou'll find your way eventually, though.

I met 3 of my 2+ year long relationships on okcupid. Nerdy girls are generally not the type that want one night stands so don't go on those platforms. If I became single again I would go back to that not tinder.\n\nHaving a long bio and reading someone else's long bio can give you more things to connect over and when one topic is sorta talked put you will have an idea for the next topic the date is less likely to think you want a one night stand. And they will know you better so most of the people who would ghost you filter themselves out before you even get to the date.\n\nWhen the date is finished let the emotions simmer and then after a day or two send a text saying \"I had a lot of fun doing x with with you and would like to see you again sometime\" and let them pace the response or pace the next date. Shows you are interested but not in a pushy way.",

Especially if the women are already anxious and nerdy girls are usually more anxious than party girls. \n\nI think you should give it a try. You don't have to put a last name. Can choose a general city as your location. Don't lie about you age but list your interests and hobbies. You don't have to put personal details out there. Do you think women would? \n\nIf what you're doing now doesn't work out maybe you should keep the option open and try something different before giving up. \n\nI'm really rooting for you.

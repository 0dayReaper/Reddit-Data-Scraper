    "postText": "You'll never know how I felt. How I feel. How tortured I was and am by the realities of what was once us. \n\nIt wasn't fixable. It is the hard truth that you made me realize but came to deny in the end. \n\nI made the hard decision. It was a decision I didn't include you in. I know it was for the best for both of us, even though you'll never know how truly difficult it was for me to carry forward with it. \n\nNo one can understand, and I could never explain it to them.  I apologized for you in public and in silence. To your face, and under my pillow at nights before I sleep. I apologize for you still.  \n\nEven when it was all said and done, I'd hope that the Him you spoke of would have been right. I had such high expectations of you. They were objectively unreasonable, but you convinced me that our love was just that. Something that overcame objective standards. \n\nYou placed high expectations in me. I attempted to meet them at every turn, and I believe I tried and exceeded all of that which anyone could have. I believe I put in more than I had ever in my life. \n\nYou willingly pushed me away. Weeks went on, and it came to a point that I could no longer deny that it was destroying us in our individual capacities. You called my letter insincere, but I don't think you really took the time to ever read between the lines of what my words spoke. I knew I couldnt face you to do it because I would be too weak and give in to your smile and your eyes always full of wonder and excitment. \n\nI didnt deny you your chance to meet and speak. I heard so many things other than what I needed to. All I needed to hear from you was I love you and I will never let you go and be captured by your warm embrace. It was fear, not love which brought you back to me. \n\nI ran. Both for me and for you. \n\nI know you did things, things that make my stomach curl and make me want to throw up. Part of me forgives you, even though you don't need such forgiveness.  I stood idly for a year, my heart guarded, though in the public eye it did not seem so. I don't know what I was expecting. I knew what was to come, but it does not lessen the pain. I've been there before. It is not a place I can come back from. I wish my heart was as forgiving. It was what I needed to be, in order to set you free so you could finally be the confident beautiful woman I always knew you to be. \n\nSo many times in your life, you bore the burden so others would not need to. \n\nI shall in silence. For you. Because even if you'll never know, I did/do so at my expense, for you. So you are happy. Its the only thing I ever wanted for the shy girl who I danced  with that first night on the rooftop.My best friend. \n\nI wish you trusted in me the way I trusted in you. I believe in time, you will understand what I said - that I was meant to serve my purpose in that chapter of your life. I hope you appreciate a good person when they are in front of you. I was a good person.  \n\nIt both pains me and makes me glad to see you embracing experiences and seizing the happiness you can find every day. Even though I do not pray -  I pray - as you would, that you have found closure. That you are genuinly happy. I could never wish ill of you no matter how much you will hurt me now. \n\nI don't think you truly know how much you meant to me. I've loved and lost many times, but this was something different.  I loved you with the whole of my heart. I hope I can find that again in my lifetime. \n\nYou had never experienced such real love. I just hope it serves you well. That it meant something for your future happiness. That you look back fondly for the time we shared together. That you learn. That you grow. I hope I am equally benefited in this experience the way I hope you will be. I hope that I am worthy of that type of happiness.\n\nI know in time, we will both be ok. I just miss my best friend, and I havent been the same ever since. \n\nI bear the burden so you don't have to. I wish you knew, but you never will. ",

The substance of what I've written is such that I loved her, but I know that we can't be together and I wish it could have been different, but it isn't. \n\nI've taken much responsibility. Humbly, and shamelessly. My intent in writing what I've written is to get it off my chest, or did you miss the meaning of the subreddit? If I was all those things or more I would say such directly to her and burden her happiness when it does not need to be. \n\nI wish you well.",

                    "comment": "Our whole relationship was trying to work on things. I tried. You know when they say, sometimes love is just not enough. That pretty much sums it. I was patient with her, reassuring, everything.  I fundamentally changed how I was vs. in my previous relationships and did so with joy because of how special she was to me. I wanted to give her the best of me and make her happy. Because we were friends first, I knew of all the troubles she'd been through and just wanted to make her happy - even if at my expense, because I felt like she was such a heart of gold and deserved the best. My surrounding, both family and friends, think I'm crazy about my perception of her and think I make excuses for her and the way she treated me. I can't explain it to them because to do so would be me violating the confidentiality we shared amongst each other. We were incompatible in some ways, which complicated things, but I always tried my best to navigate those things. Ultimately, she was a great person who let her insecurities and anxiety get the best of her. I respect her and the time she shared so I won't drag her through the mud,  I can see their point if I take my subjective thoughts out of it. Maybe I'm just soft.  \nIn any case, we're both seeing other people now. It's been almost a year since we ended. While I know of her situation, I have not advertised mine or been petty with it because I want her to grow and be happy in her new one without being reminded of the past. He's a nice guy. I hope they work out. She was a big part of my life, and yes I miss her presence in my life. Obviously, it can be painful (I am only human), but I wish her nothing but the best. There was just so much love there and it's just a pitty that she wasn't able to see my worth before it was too late. She just hurt me too much in the end for me to trust her with my heart again. I've found that writing this out has been a good outlet for me to cope with any unresolved feelings I might have.   \nThe girl I've been dating knows how much I was hurt, I am very open and honest about what I have experienced. She makes any baggage I might have feel like feathers, so I'm going to try one more time at happiness. I think we are all deserving of that. Even my ex who could have, but didn't know how to or wouldn't allow herself to trust in and fully appreciate the person I am.",

The first one they had something important came up they had to reschedule. The second one they just s*** on me for a person that the day before they told me they weren't going to hang out with anymore because that person was poisonous to them and their life and that they had them in situations at times that they couldn't stand so they had decided to walk away from that person. The very next time they just dis me to go there to that person the very next day. After that the third time it was met with more of a I don't have time for this kind of eye roll. The fourth time wasn't even acknowledged after it was said yeah we'll do that then when I asked again they just didn't even acknowledge me. And the fifth time we didn't have a chance to make it to after I initially requested because I'd reached out and said something to them about I'm happy to be back my kid's life.\n\nAnd they came back with a veiled threat and accusing me of abandonment which yes I had not been in my kid's life years previous but my kids were not abandoned from a previous situation 3 years ago when I was lied on, squeezed out, silenced, and allowed no opportunity to defend myself against the accusations that's not abandonment\n\nAt that moment I snapped. They went no contact. I said a million and one things I didn't mean. The end",

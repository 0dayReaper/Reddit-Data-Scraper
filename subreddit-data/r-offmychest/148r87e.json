    "postText": "I'm totally in tears and feeling like shit. I saw him yesterday in a party after not talking with him for a month and it felt like destiny because I was thinking about him this entire week for some reason. He texted me and invited for a date today. I was so happy. He said that we can see each other as soon as I'm ready and I went quickly put make up, choose a cute outfit, do my hair, take a bath, etc. I was so excited and the smile wouldn't leave my face. And guess what, he just stopped answering me and ghosted me. Already 2 hours passed and no message but he was online. \n\nWhat hurts the most is that I was going on a second date for another guy this week because the first one was really great and he even kissed me. The connection was really great and he talked about seeing me again. He didn't block neither unfollowed me so I just took it as him being sincere about the second date. In the begging of the week I messaged him asking if he has time this week and he ghosted me too.\n\nBesides that a very good friend of mine opened a store and was posting the entire month to people come visit it. I messaged him 2 days ago asking if I can come to see, because I really wanted to support him, and he left me on read. \n\n\nWhat the actual fuck is happening. \n\nI know I shouldn't cry because of this but it's so painful.",

There could be a reason people stop replying, and even if there isn\u2019t, that is not a reflection on you at all! I\u2019d check in again with your friend in case they\u2019ve just been so busy with the store. And I\u2019d also try to find some time to hang out with your other friends to take your mind off the dates. I\u2019m also in quite a rut with my dating life so I totally feel you but I\u2019m trying to spend more time with friends and find my intimacy with friendships. Hope this helps and good luck!!",

Other people can be oblivious, in their own world, and dealing with their problems. \n\nI\u2019ve left people on read and every single time it has been because I\u2019ve been too stressed, dangling on by a thread, or dealing with personal issues and has absolutely nothing to do with them.

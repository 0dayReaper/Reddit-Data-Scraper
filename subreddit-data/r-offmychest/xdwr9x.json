    "postText": "There was a boy in my neighborhood that I had a crush on as a kid. Nothing came of it and we were never particularly close.\n\nYears later he passed away in a car accident he was at fault for, and killed several people. No drugs or alcohol involved - it was snowy, slick, and he was a new driver. I felt horrible for everyone, but especially his poor mother.\n\nHis mom was a single parent who struggled financially. From what I understand, she practically bankrupted herself to pay for the funeral and for another car. On top of losing her only child.\n\nSo, I secretly leave him offerings periodically. Sometimes near his birthday, death day, or Christmas - I always leave it before the date, so his mom sees it. Apparently she posts about it on Facebook, all excited someone still remembers her son and wondering who it could be.",

Thank you for remembering him and letting his mom have that moment of happiness. It will mean more to her than you ever know. \n\nIf, for some reason you have to stop due to moving it might be smart to leave a small note just so she knows. A lot of people forgot my sons passing day this past year and the lack of outreach from family and friends had me wrecked. But please know, you\u2019re doing an amazing thing and this post gave me so much hope.",

I think a letter would be good too - I\u2019d put it in a laminated envelope to keep it safe from the rain, and I think I\u2019d address it to him directly. I would talk about all the times we had together as kids. We mostly hung out over the course of a single summer, like every day we\u2019d wake up and play tag or skate. He once pushed me while I was on the swings, and stupid me jumped off - and got hurt. He carried me inside and put some Neosporin on it, and I was pretty sure at the time that made him Prince Charming, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it for weeks lol",

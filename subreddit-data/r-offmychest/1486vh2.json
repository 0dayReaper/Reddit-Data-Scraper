    "postText": "My (33F) dad (60M) and brother(24M)  are helping me move and in the hurry, I scooted my dildo under the bed so my dad and brother wouldn\u2019t find it. Well, my dad got ahead of me while my brother and I were working on packing my office space and he was sweeping and such and I am pretty sure he found it and threw it away because when I went to my bedroom, I had the sudden realization that I forgot about the dildo and when I looked under the bed, ir was gone and my dad had been sweeping nonchalantly in the the bedroom just a little prior and came back and kept cleaning and packing and asking me where to put x y z. I am a little embarrassed but at the same time annoyed that he didn\u2019t bother to just leave it there. I guess I am just venting a bit mostly but mortified because my dad is uber religious but he\u2019s also good at keeping a straight face so I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going through his head. I think I may just let it be and not bring it up at all.",

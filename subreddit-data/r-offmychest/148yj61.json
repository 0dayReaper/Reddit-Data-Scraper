    "postText": "I love her so much. Sometimes I feel like I can't express myself enough. This has never happened to me before in my life.\n\nEver since she came into my life I feel like the happiest and luckiest person in the world. \n\nBefore that I didn't know why I was here, I was sad. All the time in my life I kept thinking how great it would be if I could go back to the past, because it always seemed better than the current time. But right now, I'm FUCKING EAGER FOR THE FUTURE\n\nI can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her, we are already thinking about our wedding, trips, kids etc.\n\nWe love and want each other in the same intensity, we both are very needy for affection, we both understand each other, everything is fucking perfect. I've met my soulmate. I've never thought this would actually happen. SHE IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE",

    "postText": "if I open up to my family I\u2019d be considered inconsiderate and selfish, if I open up to my friends they\u2019d just brush it off as it \u201chappens to everyone\u201d and then go back to talking to each other in a happy tone. I have to be happy so that everyone else is comfortable around me. I already have an awkward and blunt personality. I can never feel like I can rely on anyone because most of my friends already treat me like a little kid. I\u2019m terrified to talk to teachers at school and waste their time. When I tried to get therapy I lied so much because I was scared that she\u2019d just brush off my emotions and feelings and the guilt of wasting her time ate at me so much that I never attended twice. The few times I do try to talk to my friends or parents about it they just say \u201cit\u2019s apart of life\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re just sensitive\u201d.  How can I even feel loved when I\u2019m so scared to? I\u2019m so lonely it\u2019s insane.",

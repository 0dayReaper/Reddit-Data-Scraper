    "postText": "I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail. But I fucked up. I fucked up big time. \n\nI was obsessed with this guy, I had constant fantasies in my head about him. I romanticised the fuck out of him. He and I sat down and talked, he made it clear he wanted to be friends. Instead of me respecting that, I made this HUGE gesture and sacrifice that I thought would get him to fall for me. It was embarrassing, it was cringey, it was harmful for him. Now he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with this group that we are both involved in. \n\nI feel so ashamed, and so, so, so stupid. This has happened recently and I\u2019m trying to pick up the pieces that I have shattered. This is a valuable lesson that I have learned, but I\u2019m sad that I hurt someone in this process. I\u2019m going to take this one step at a time, but man, this sucks. This whole situation sucks, and it\u2019s completely my fault.",

I live paycheck to paycheck and SO is very very confortable money side but it doesn\u2019t mean that because he has money, that he can never feel tight money wise when he has to pay for a car, a house and the normal bills.

It isn't doom and gloom though, we're going through an adoption now of an amazing little boy that we're VERY hopeful to have in our home very soon!  We also have another wonderful foster girl in our home now and she has given me plenty to think about whenever I feel sad because of the boy that aren't in the house anymore.\n\nSorry to hear about the number and severity of your medical problems. I sincerely hope that one day you wont carry that burden, but know that either way I hope  you have lots of happy memories ahead.\n\nInternet stranger",

Even calling what I went through as a kid 'trivial experiences'\n\nAnd you know what?  I beat myself up for a long time that I must have caused her hurt by not appreciating how badly she had suffered.  Got a great therapist now and she is helping me understand that my 'trivial' experiences were far from that.  Hey ho.",

Still blaming me entirely and being so dang passive aggressive.\n\nShe keeps on using the belief that I am more privileged than she is as an excuse. Privilege is just as hard to measure as pain is, so I don\u2019t bother with it.\n\nSo yeah. Comparing anything sucks. Fortune or misfortune. Joy or misery. It makes everyone involved miserable and it just destroys relationships.\n\nI don\u2019t hate my friend. I love her. She is a strong, intelligent, artistic, woman. A good mom too.

While I was really sad for him it felt really...  Out of place to be the person he chose to look for help and comforting. He was saying stuff like \"it's the worst week of my life\" \"you don't understand how hard it is\", etc. While my brother wasn't even buried. I didn't say a thing because I'm not playing those stupid pain Olympics and I tried my best to be a good friend but I don't know man. I found it quite indecent. Even now years later he still talks about how this year was the worst of his life and how I can't understand it. Yep.

However, I will say, everyone\u2019s pain is their own and we don\u2019t know how much it hurts unless we are experiencing it ourselves (and I\u2019m not even talking about the same general experience like a breakup; breakups cause different levels of pain depending on the person and what they\u2019ve been through). So I don\u2019t mind if people talk to me about their issues even if they feel \u201csmaller\u201d than mine. It becomes a problem when they refuse to listen to what you have to say and lack any empathy, like what your friend said, \u201cyou don\u2019t understand how hard it is\u201d. I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t mean it as it sounds, but it does feel like it\u2019s undermining what you went through which shows a lack of empathy.

People that are suffering in hospital beds as a tumor eats them from the inside out like what happened to my own brother. People that have not eaten in weeks, that are rooting around in the mud looking for anything that can sustain their lives if not for just another moment.\n\nMy petty needs and wants that drown me in misery. My loneliness, my chronic underachieving, etc blah blah. It doesn't matter. I just gotta suck it up and carry on.

A lot of these people in the comments are talking about how their ex friends used to treat their traumas too over the top and compare, and doesn\u2019t that kinda prove my point? Someone with less problems is trying to put their trauma on the same level as someone with worse problems. I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s so hard to comprehend that people can have worse issues and therefore need better help. This is a genuine question, I\u2019m speaking as someone who\u2019s had mental issues. There\u2019s people i know that will receive all this sugarcoat treatment that others with the same problems know they don\u2019t need, and act as if people are invalidating their trauma for telling them to do something. And it\u2019s paints a bad picture for the rest. The word trauma is thrown around so loosely, it\u2019s losing its meaning. Some people are starting to use it as some sort of personality booster now.

But if u watch ur grandpa get strangled in his sleep it\u2019s much worse that hearing that your grandpa died in his sleep so yes everyone hurts in the same way but it can be way more traumatic for others",

As the woman's 14-year-old daughter mourned her loss at the funeral, one crazy aunt informed her that she was lucky her mom died so slowly because crazy aunt's husband died suddenly while out running - which was \"much more traumatic for her children.\"",

Attempting to do so is like comparing Michael Jordan to Lebron James in the NBA... just because their stats show one was better than the other, you could never say Lebron could play better basketball than Jordan because Lebron\u2019s stats are better... because Jordan being a Hall of Famer, his skills are so diverse a person with common sense would say \u201cIt\u2019d be a damn good game let the best player win.\u201d The experience might not mean shit to you, but it might have effected the person going through the trauma in a way no one else can understand.",

    "postText": "Asking for a friend. My friend says that his gf has acting strange for 2 months (approx). They just celebrated their year anniversary like two weeks ago, but he\u2019s telling me that she\u2019s acting strange for a considerable time. He\u2019s asks her constantly whether she\u2019s fine or not, but he always gets the same answer: \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d But everything\u2019s got a little weirder today when she saw a friend of hers and she asked her if she and my friend were still dating.  Because of that question my friends gf thought that my friend was cheating on her and her friend was about to tell her that. But it wasn\u2019t the case, however my friend is really preoccupied because she\u2019s been acting like that for some time. What\u2019s the advice you would give to my friend?",

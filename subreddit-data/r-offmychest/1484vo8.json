    "postText": " Today I noticed they didn\u2019t respond to my \u201cI love you\u201ds and when I confronted them, we talked everything out and agreed to take a break/breakup kind of. We\u2019re claiming to tell each other when we\u2019re ready again since we\u2019ve both been mentally not well. They\u2019re still my best friend outside of a romantic relationship and a weight was lifted off my chest to find out WHY they didn\u2019t say they loved me back, it\u2019s just their mental health. We both cried in the end and I\u2019m feeling shitty again. Things are a bit awkward but hopefully we\u2019ll be better. I have 0 friends so I may attempt making some. We both have no interest in finding a new relationship as we\u2019re waiting for each other, but nonetheless, hopefully things will get better. Sometimes I\u2019m perfectly fine, others I\u2019m torn up, it\u2019s extra hard as I don\u2019t have a private place to cry (only at night when no one\u2019s up) or anyone to talk to, so here I am. Today/This past week has been hard. Hopefully the upcoming week gets better. I already miss them honestly, just thinking of people flirting with them.",

    "postText": "I met my ex in 2012, right after he turned 20 and I had just turned 30. I had only dated and been with women exclusively until I came out as bi-sexual at 28. Let\u2019s just say the year I was 29 was a busy year making up for what I missed out on. It was mostly casual hookups (yes, safe) and I did try dating 2 different guys for a few weeks, but it just never worked out or got serious. I kinda figured that I\u2019d probably end up marrying a woman or not getting married at all because I just didn\u2019t see myself catching romantic and sexual feelings for a guy. Then I met Ryan. From the first date it was just like the only other time in my life I had fallen in love\u2026butterflies, constantly thinking about him, wanting to spend every moment with him. He fell for me hard too and we became an item, though he did say while he considered my bisexuality a turn on, because he had a thing for straight guys, it also gave him pause because of my desires for the opposite sex and his concern it may lead me astray. I thought about it and understood it was a legitimate worry, but assured him that I couldn\u2019t even think about anyone else because I was really into him. Note: I knew he was the one by the end of the first month and I was in love, but I wasn\u2019t going to say these things too soon and risk scaring him off. \n\nOn our first date he admitted to me that he was legally blind due to a genetic disorder and that it was progressive and eventually he would only have a sliver of his peripheral vision. He immediately said he understood if I didn\u2019t want to see him again because no other guy had wanted to date him and be his driver all of the time. I grew up with a brother in a wheelchair who never learned how to walk or talk due to misdiagnosed meningitis at 6 months old back in the 70s. I told him that and said that what my brother had was a severe disability, so in my perspective, his blindness had no effect in my feelings and that always being the driver was a small sacrifice just to be with him. \n\nThe following years were bliss. We brought out the best in each other. My family who was surprised, but very supportive when I came out, adored Ryan and treated him like family and said that I acted happier since we\u2019d been together. When I met him he was working part-time in retail and had done very poorly in high school because he lost a lot of his confidence as his vision deteriorated. I told him that one thing I did insist on was that he do something with his life because he had too much to offer and that I would help. He said that he\u2019d wanted to be a teacher but didn\u2019t think someone with limited vision could teach\u2026.nonsense. So I put him through community college for 2 years, then 2.5 years of a local university and finally the 1 year teacher certification program as required by California. I drove countless miles and paid hundreds in public transportation costs for him, never blinking an eye or complaining. \n\nWe\u2019d been together for 7.5 years and were engaged to be married in October by the time he was in his last semester of his teaching certification which involved him student teaching at his former high school with his favorite teacher from his days in school. Then the pandemic hit and schools closed. Fortunately he\u2019d had enough hours in the classroom that he would still qualify to be certified after the Governor issued a waiver via executive order. On the 3rd day of the stay at home order in March my life crumbled when I innocently found out he had cheated on me with an ex all because he handed his phone to me to show me something on Instagram. I accidentally fat thumbed the back arrow when he gave it to me taking me back to a list of all his messages. I looked and recognized the name of his ex as the second message, dated a week ago. I clicked on it and my heart sank. Directions to my house, pictures, dirty talk, and reassuring him not to worry about me because he had my location on my \u201cFind My Friends,\u201d just in case I came home from work. \n\nI immediately started screaming demanding to know everything and he admitted to having his ex over twice for sex and that they didn\u2019t use protection (his ex was engaged to his gf during this, adding another victim). Then he admitted to sleeping with his straight but curious recently single cousin (by marriage) twice, again no protection. Finally he admitted to sleeping with a supposedly straight guy he and many of my cousins went to school with who I told Ryan I really didn\u2019t like him or want them talking because I didn\u2019t trust him after what I'd read about him. Since they were never close friends I didn\u2019t feel like this was a big sacrifice or that I was being too controlling AND I assumed that he knew why I (and all my cousins) felt that way, but didn\u2019t bother repeating it. The reason was after high school at age 20 this guy was convicted of sexual assault and penetration with a foreign object against a 16 year old girl and had gone to jail and required to register as a sex offender for life. Apparently my ex was the only person in his graduating class that hadn\u2019t heard that news. All of this happened in my home while I was working. We spent the whole weekend crying with me asking over and over why and him repeatedly crying and saying he just didn\u2019t know and that he felt terrible. \n\nMonday comes around and anger started being as common as sadness and I made a comment that said I was going to pull all the phone records going back the 3 years that AT&amp;T kept them (for a fee). Only when he heard that did he admit to one more guy. Some random named Frankie off the gay hookup app Grindr who was the first guy he cheated with and continued to casually hookup with for nearly 2 years with the last time being in February (the month before). He told me how it started. Get this \u2013 it was the DAY AFTER his graduation with his BA in May 2018 and he was drunk from celebrating and wanted to have sex. I too had been celebrating with him and said I was too drunk to perform and said I\u2019d make it up the next day, then passed out asleep on the couch. Apparently he was \u201cangry horny\u201d because he downloaded Grindr, chatted with this Frankie fellow and arranged to have sex in his car in a church parking lot across the street from our condo (which happens to be across the street from a school\u2026this fact is important later), all while I slept on the couch. All the times they hooked up after that was again in my condo while I was working or visiting a friend for the night up the coast (he used to love going but started saying he couldn\u2019t occasionally because of \u201chomework\u201d and \u201cstudying.\u201d \n\nI absolutely lost it, told him to get in the car and I drove him to his family\u2019s house so he could tell them what he did so they understood why he was moving back into their house. While he was in the house I was in the driveway on the phone with AT&amp;T ordering the 3 years worth of detailed call/text logs, then made an appointment to be screened for STIs. I suspended his service until he could figure out how to pay for his own damn phone, then , deleted the social media accounts he cheated with and to make sure he couldn't hide more evidence I temporarily changed all his passwords so only I would have access to his cloud. I also called the bank and issued a stop payment on his final tuition check that I had sent to the certification program the week before and hadn\u2019t hit the bank yet. Before deleting his social media, except Facebook, I took screenshots of the entire Instagram conversation with his ex and mailed the conversation to his fianc\u00e9e, who deserved to know so she could see a doctor and get tested too. His family was very religious and had kicked him out in high school for 3 days when he tried to admit he was bi and only took him back in when he took it back. Needless to say, she ended it, he got kicked out. ONE DOWN. \n\nHe came back out to the car and we went home. I took his house key and told him to say goodbye to our 3 pets and get packing. The entire time he packed I studied those phone records to find out dates, times and if there was anyone else he was leaving out. He answered every question I asked and it was then that I discovered that the sex offender and he had only had oral sex in my home and that the actual sex was in the same parking lot he screwed the Frankie guy in. \n\nThe wheels started turning and the next day I went over there and sure enough spotted a camera. I spoke to a secretary at the church and informed them about a registered sex offender having sex in their lot and that not only was it a violation of his parole for indecent exposure, but that he was not allowed to be that close to a school and I provided the date. I was in luck! They had a digital two year loop system that started deleting day by day after it had been retained for 2 years +1 day. It was April 2020 and he first cheated with Frankie in May 2018 and the sex offender was in April 2019. I told them I was filing a police report and that probation would require a copy of it eventually. They said they would save the file and allowed me a thumb drive of both days to submit with my police report. Within a month the sex offender was locked up again. TWO DOWN. \n\nI also filed a police report against the Frankie guy. The police said it was a relatively minor infraction but since it was across from a school playground and skate park they would follow up but there would be no jail time. I researched the hell out of Frankie and called him to confront him. He was smug and admitted to knowing about me the whole time. What he didn\u2019t know is that I had found out he had a job that required a security clearance and he had several judgements against him and collection agencies had been looking for him. I didn\u2019t know why they couldn\u2019t find him and just garnish his wages, but it ends up he was Hispanic and had two last names and was a Jr., plus he frequently by his middle name Francisco, Frankie for short\u2026so he got lost in the paperwork confusion. I sent a letter to the collection agencies providing his employer and current location and contact info and then sent a copy of the police report about misdemeanor indecent exposure for which he pled guilty and it was a fine with community service (not considered a sex crime). His wages did get garnished, but only for two paychecks because the misdemeanor was enough for him to lose his security clearance and get fired. THREE DOWN. \n\nThen I contacted Ryan\u2019s family on his mother\u2019s side pretending to be him from his Facebook account making sure they knew he had fucked his cousin. It spread through the family like wildfire and soon his cousin was contacting me because he couldn\u2019t get a hold of Ryan to ask why he would expose what they did. I just laughed and said you shouldn\u2019t screw your cousins, especially when they\u2019re engaged and that he\u2019d messed around in my house, so now it was my turn for payback. FOUR DOWN. \n\nLastly, I had already stopped payment but since he was so close to finishing I was sure his family would bail him out and pay the university. Like I said, indecent exposure is usually a slap on the wrist type misdemeanor. However, I remembered some of the paperwork he signed to be a mandated reporter that you could lose teaching certification for \u201cdocumented acts of moral turpitude.\u201d I sent a copy of both police reports from the parking lot with still shots from the security footage clearly showing Ryan\u2019s face to the school district he\u2019d been student teaching in and a copy to the Commission on Teacher Credentials. FIFTH AND FINAL DOWN! \n\nAdmittedly, I did all this out of anger but he shattered my sense of self-worth and made me incredibly bitter and untrusting after years of being generous and supporting him. Everywhere I looked in the town I thought of Ryan and the cheating. I felt a terrible energy in my condo knowing it all happened there. I stayed 9 months and watched all 5 of their lives self-destruct. Then sold my condo (making a nice profit) and relocated to the PNW to start over. One thing that is sad is I found out just recently that his ex-who\u2019s fianc\u00e9 broke up with him ended up committing suicide several months after I moved. It is too bad that his family was so closed minded to turn on their own son, but in the end, it\u2019s not my fault that he cheated on his fianc\u00e9 by coming into my home at my fianc\u00e9\u2019s invitation to cheat. Suicide is never the answer to ones problems and I hope the fianc\u00e9e he cheated on doesn't blame herself and that only his family does (as they should).\n\nTLDR: I emotionally and financially supported my ex through college and his teacher credential program for over 7 years only to discover he had cheated on me with 4 different guys, one of them the day after he graduated and then occasionally for nearly two years in my home while I was at work. I took my revenge: My ex lost his career before it even started and our relationship, one AP (affair partner) lost his job and had bill collectors after him, another lost his fianc\u00e9e and was kicked out, a third was humiliated when his entire family found out he had sex with his cousin and the fourth was put in jail for a violating probation. Lesson: Don't Cheat and Deceive.",

That\u2019s\u2026just taking it too far. \n\nI understand being hurt beyond words and angry and feeling lost but\u2026this is borderline stalking. And you ruined these mens\u2019 lives but RYAN was the one being unfaithful. Especially the men who no longer have their families because of this. You spent months of your life obsessing over this and then afterwards and (even now probably) stalking them after the damage had been done to see the aftermath. \n\nYou also as a 30 year old married a freshly turned 20 year old. You knew he was \u201cthe one\u201d after knowing him for a month\u2026but it never seemed odd to you that your sexuality was fetishized by him? This guy was basically a teen when you met him at age 30\u2026I just kind of worry about this situation for you. It seems like Ryan may have been playing you from the beginning. Either way none of this seems like it benefits or helps you in any way. I hope now that you got this off your chest you can put it all to rest/behind you and move on with your life.",

From the context you give, it just sounds like he needed to take control of at least one aspect of his life and you flipped at the realization that you cannot buy someone into loving you. Tough break, I genuinely hope you work through this before entering another relationship.",

But this revenge story reeks of controlling behavior and perhaps underlying problems in the relationship, even emotional abuse. Being this controlling is odd. Like, him deleting his social media etc is very strange, he's a grown ass man who should be able to control his own social media and things of that nature. Just leave him and get on with your life.. \ud83d\ude02 He dwelled too much on this.",

He hurt you, no doubt. You also seem to have kept quite a ledger of what  you spent on him and did for him too.  Sorry about your investment. \n\nAre you proud of what you did? Are you going to tell future friends and partners what you did? Is your own pain lessened by destroying others? I bet you have a real taste for making other people miserable now. How are you going to satisfy that craving? Do you think you are healthy now? Do you think you'll wind up anything other that bitter and alone?",

Women dream about getting this kind of revenge. You are soooooooo lucky you got closure and revenge. Update: the man I have no closure with does have two snap accounts. Ones under his phone and ones under his email. Interesting. The plot thickens.",

    "postText": "I (21F) am taking summer classes to finish my bachelor\u2019s degree sooner rather than later. I\u2019m taking classes on child developmental psychology, substance abuse psych, just finished a shit required health course, and am starting a class on adolescent literature soon.\n\nI\u2019ll finish my minor with the psych classes and I\u2019m excited to be done with that, but I didn\u2019t consider how hard it would take a toll on me mentally/emotionally. It\u2019s difficult reading about substance abuse in my textbook and getting d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, because every example of an addict or alcoholic just sounds like what I grew up with due to my mom. It\u2019s frustrating thinking about how differently my life could\u2019ve been if she just hadn\u2019t. It\u2019s more complex than that, but the gist of it is: if she would just face her fucking problems then I wouldn\u2019t have to be facing the consequences of her not dealing with her shit. It\u2019s tiring. It\u2019s frustrating. It\u2019s not something I should\u2019ve been exposed to or treated like the outlet for.\n\nIn child development psych, it\u2019s more of the same: why you shouldn\u2019t hit children, parenting tips, how smart kids are, and knowing signs of abuse. I was 9 when I was asked why I had a black eye at school and I was 9 when I lied to cover up for my mom; \u201cI tripped\u201d when really she got mad at me for brushing my teeth too slow and slammed my head into the sink. What a great childhood I had\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t ever look back at the one time an adult took notice and regret convincing them I fucking tripped.\n\nMy adolescent literature class starts in two weeks and I decided to work ahead on the materials, because we have to read 6 books (300 pages a pop) in 4 weeks which isn\u2019t much time when you also have textbooks to read and psych projects/tests to do; so I\u2019m reading ahead. The first book is about a boy whose family is murdered and he\u2019s adopted by ghosts so he grows up in their graveyard. The first few chapters are episodic then slowly get a solid overarching story. I accidentally read 230 pages in one sitting when I said I would only start a chapter. It\u2019s not the best book in the world (it is written for children), but somehow that made me cry. I haven\u2019t finished it, but I\u2019m touched. Some boy ends up in a graveyard and they just take care of him, of course, he goes on adventures, but for the most part it\u2019s the adults in his life loving him and being worried about him- learning from their mistakes and not making them again. It\u2019s the kind of book I used to read when I was a kid: spooky, with an orphan main character who (for some reason) was special, and silly side characters with funny lines. It\u2019s making me cry.\n\nI grew up locking myself away in my room, escaping my mother\u2019s liquor fueled wrath in books like this one. I don\u2019t want to finish the book, but I have to eventually. Then I have to remember that ghosts aren\u2019t real, that there\u2019s no special orphan boy who goes on adventures in his graveyard, and it\u2019s making me cry.",

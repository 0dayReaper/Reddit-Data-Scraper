    "postText": "I have a best friend of 17 years. But it had huge gaps during the timeline. We were very close back in college so that would be the first 5-6 years. Then we became busy after that because we graduated from college. On the 10th year, we\u2019d be catching up every once in a while but it wasn\u2019t the same as before. Probably because we were busy with our careers. But, despite not being able to spend time together, we still label ourselves as best friends.\n\nFast forward to the 16th year, we were able to spend more time together probably because our careers have stabilized and we had more free time. \n\nI\u2019d like to believe that during these recent years, we\u2019ve rekindled our friendship. It felt really good. I was catching up on her because there were a lot of changes, personality-wise, because it\u2019s been almost a decade. Everything was smooth until her husband cheated on her. This of course shattered her. \n\nI was one of the first people to know and she went to my house to talk about what happened. \n\nTo my perspective, she wasn\u2019t thinking straight. She wanted to spend all of her money just to sue her husband. She was angry and everything she wanted to do was vengeful to a point that it might cost things on her end. \n\nOf course this is understandable because she was hurting. I tried to put back some logic and practicality into the conversation but of course I didn\u2019t force myself. She was clearly hurting and was emotional. \n\nUntil I said something that agitated her to a point that she stormed off. I simply said, \u201cthere may have been a problem before the cheating.\u201d \n\nI was trying to be objective because I\u2019ve become friends with the husband as well. But of course, there is no justification for cheating. I am married too and I can\u2019t imagine what I would feel if I were cheated on. I do not condone cheating. But I do have some friends who had similar experiences who tried to make things work despite the infidelity. Today, they are with kids and are as happy as ever. In my head, maybe that could happen to my best friend. Maybe she could be happy again. That\u2019s all I ever wanted for her. \n\n3 months after she stormed off, I discovered that she blocked me from her social media accounts. She wouldn\u2019t reply to my messages. \n\nIt hurts me a lot that I think I lost my best friend. I even cried to my wife because I valued our friendship that much. \n\nI feel like I failed as a friend. I wasn\u2019t the friend she needed. \n\nAt the same time, I feel like maybe our friendship was already dead to begin with. Maybe somewhere along the 17 years of friendship, we drifted apart and we just pretended that it didn\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking of making an effort to reach out to her. Maybe go to her office or via a common friend. But I feel like I\u2019d fail again as a friend. Maybe it\u2019d be better if I just let the friendship die already because it felt like it was going there anyway, or maybe, it\u2019s already dead. \n\nKeen on hearing your thoughts. Should I make an effort to reach out or should I just let the friendship die?",

            "comment": "Hi there, I have best friends of 17 years myself too, and she\u2019s married now. We used to be very close, but since I move abroad-and-back-and-abroad again we only talked from time to time. I considered her my best friend too. We are no longer talking heart to heart these days, since she\u2019s married with kid.. the dynamic of our friendship change. We are catching up and updating our lives from time to time. \n\nA few months ago I found out she has been in an almost life-threatening situation due to an illness, I was devastated and I found out about it quite \u201clate\u201d. I was devastated feeling like a bad friend. \nI gave her an advice that made her stopped responding to me. But I wasn\u2019t blocked. I didn\u2019t know if I hurt her or if I overstepped my boundaries by saying that advice. \nThe magnitude of my problem is not as big as yours, but OP, given that we really valued this friendship, I\u2019d bet you that it really weighed you deep down to have \u201cunresolved\u201d situation.\n\nI ended up reaching my friend again - this time more carefully, and asked about her feeling more than anything, to really understand her POV. People change, we change, and we are still trying to be there for our best friends. \n\nSo OP, you may have overstepped your boundaries, or it could also be that your friend overreacted in that spur moment. But I think if you let the friendship die like this, it\u2019s not giving you any closure. If I were you, I\u2019d give it sometime and try to contact her again via common friends or handwritten letter. \nIf she truly values you the same way as you value her in your life, you can see it then. If not, then the relationship is unfortunately salvaged\u2026 \n\nBest of luck OP!",

It's a relief to know that I have someone who shares my sentiments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;If she truly values you the same way as you value her in your life, you can see it then. If not, then the relationship is unfortunately salvaged\u2026\n\nThis is what I think is holding me back from reaching out to her. I feel that maybe she never valued our friendship just as much as I value her. In the past, I've always been the one to reach out whenever there would be conflict between us.\n\nNot that I don't want to make amends, it's just that I feel like maybe she'd rather not have me in her life anymore. And maybe I'm a coward that I'd rather not hear her say that to my face. \n\nIt's true what you said that a lot of things can change in 17 years. And maybe that's the sad truth about our friendship. We grew apart and we were just holding on to whatever \"friendship\" we had left.\n\nClosure-wise, I also felt like our friendship had closed a long time ago already. Just like you, we didn't have the heart-to-heart conversations anymore. It was really more of Hi's and Hello's. I'd know more about my workmates than my best friend.",

It feels like you\u2019re still holding back the best friend that you know 17 years ago - while now everything else has changed. \n\nIt hurts to lose a friend that you valued, and I also understand your feeling for not wanting to get straight slap on your face. But who knows that in the future you can somewhat rekindle the relationship again.",

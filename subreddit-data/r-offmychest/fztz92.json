What you are suggesting is that the person with a thousand snickers bar can, reasonably and without moral conflict, expect a person with 2 snickers to give one of theirs to someone with none. Your argument is a fallacy.\n\n Wealth breeds wealth, the US has been re-designed specifically to operate this way over the past century. Also, it's literally illegal to give food to the homeless on Texas roads so maybe look up at the legislators before blaming the person at the bottom for not giving up the $10 in their pocket. \n\nI've read your short story here, and I fully endorse half of it (we should all take time to volunteer or contribute to everyone in our society that needs help) but you've completely bought into the idea that wealth comes from hard work and effort. It does not. Not in the vast, vast majority of cases. Point at Bezzos or Gates as much as you want they both started their companies with large amounts financial support and stability. Jeff Bezzos did not work 22,000 times harder than you're average worker, he started with a good idea and lots of family backing. \n\nAlso, the idea isn't to redistribute wealth by simply taking it and giving it away. What we want is a system that can ensure that its lowest citizen can live a decent, healthy life before enabling a single individual to accrue billions. I don't want their money, I wan't the broken system that let them build their dragon's hordes fixed. \n\nSo, should I feel guilty that I can't give money to every homeless person I walk past? No. Should I feel guilty that I'm not doing enough to help fix the situation? Maybe, probably yes for most people. However, you can't put the same level of onus a middle class worker as a government that systematically oppresses the lowest class while simultaneously enabling the elite to garner fortunes greater than they could spend in a thousand lifetimes.",

Yes, some scenes are downright appalling and these people should practice social distancing, but it's insensitive to ignore the idea that these people are probably out because they have to find ways to earn money EVERY DAY just to put food on their tables. I don't think they can afford to buy their food in the supermarkets where social distancing is enforced and practiced as a rule. Yes, they should follow what local authorities say about social distancing, but it's infuriating how all of these well-off people are outright shaming them without trying to understand the situation. Are they supposed to just go hungry in their homes with mouths to feed and bills to pay? The government aid is paltry and not every poor person is qualified to receive such aid. These rich people are SO detached from the reality of living in the SAME fucking third world country. It's like they completely forget we're a third world country and probably more than half of the people can't even afford to stock up on necessities for more than a week or two.",

I was hustling my ass off and robbing Peter to pay Paul to keep my head above water. For those who would think I was born with some kind of silver spoon, think again. I grew up dirt poor on a farm, the kind of household where you got one pair of shoes a year if you were lucky, where you taped those suckers if they started falling apart, and dinner involved going out and plucking your own chicken and shucking your own corn or you went hungry.

I work with impoverished people from all walks of life in every respect other than socioeconomic status, and though I may sometimes feel like they're in the situation they're in because they made bad choices (and many of them are), the fact is that we live in societies that punish and, frankly, torture poor people in a way that I feel should be viewed as a violation of human rights. If, at very least, being poor in the US was a little bit harder because it only happened to those who didn't work hard (and certainly not to a majority of people), and if it didn't result in a vicious cycle of things no one in a first world country should experience, I wouldn't be so quick to remind you of the role luck played in getting you where you are today. Overcoming cancer to not only live but to live well and help others is amazing, and you are clearly a very compassionate and hard-working person.

Not everyone who finds themself in that socioeconomic status is there by choice or lack of action. It could also be said that a lack of guidance, leadership, or examples of people to look up to help contribute as well. Mental health, which is something we finally seem to be getting to a point where we can actually openly talk about it in this country, also contributes. As someone who has had issues in the past with deep depression I know how impossible it can be to motivate one\u2019s self when dealing with those kinds of issues. I would say that yes, a lot of people are unwilling to do much more than complain about their situation as opposed to trying to find a way out. The system of debt in this country and predatory lending practices let alone the highest interest rates for the poorest people overall are also contributing factors - that\u2019s if they can even manage to qualify for a loan. Then there is the criminal justice system which is much less interested in helping/reforming/rehabilitating than it is in turning a profit off of the people who get caught up in it. I didn\u2019t mean to come off as tone deaf or uninformed. I\u2019m surely leaving out things that help contribute to the problem of income and wealth inequality.

Many of these people are in miserable states and will turn to drugs to cope because they can't afford therapists. Meanwhile prices on everything poor people buy are going to skyrocket. Food's going to become scarce for them. Healthcare will be inaccessible. Bailouts of rich investors and companies will mean austerity measures directed at poor people. The sinking economy will drown them first.\n\nWe should have stopped travel, an approach that has worked in other countries and has a long history of working (and courts have repeatedly said can be done). We have not done so because rich assholes like Bill Gates have balked at such measures. We chose a practice that there is scant evidence for working over one that does work because one mildly inconveniences the rich. But it was the rich Chinese men who bought the pangolins to spread the virus and the rich travelers to brought it throughout the globe through expensive air travel. The rich caused this problem and exacerbated this problem and now the rich are blocking actual solutions by throwing poor people under the bus.",

The reason is that it echoes a frustration that is so relatable to society in times when most of the populace is struggling. In such times, it grates when aristocrats demonstrate just how different their lives are from those of the working class. For a celebrity, the tragedy in their broken limb is simply the reality of having broken a limb. What an inconvenience. For a poor person, the tragedy is that they were fired or put on leave because of it (I once shadowed an orthopedic surgeon and at least 3 patients a day were crying in his office because they got fired for liability reasons related to their injury), stuck with bills the couldn\u2019t pay, got evicted and lost their belongings (nowhere to put them), got bad credit precluding future loans for things like higher education or housing, and still had to deal with the reality of having a broken limb, likely with much less help. I believe that suffering is subjective, and that a celebrity may suffer just as much mentally as one of the hundreds of thousands of people for whom the above narrative was true. However, the celebrity\u2019s health and long-term quality of living will not be affected  to anywhere close to the same extent. If you\u2019re concerned with compassion and empathy, you\u2019re not excused from recognizing the disproportionate pain of people who are not celebrities.",

    "postText": "As the title implies\u2026\nI\u2019m 25f, been married to my 28m husband for 5 years. He\u2019s been busy with medical school and exam studying so he hasn\u2019t given me time since the summer we got married. He made promises to spend every free second with me after marriage but now he plays video games and binges anime. He\u2019s a cool guy but not a great husband sometimes. \n\nHe has 1 year left of medical school and then his 4 year residency starts. Residency is also very time consuming. I know I\u2019ll get him back after these 5 years are over. I don\u2019t know what to do in the mean time.\n\nDue to his high stress levels for exams, he has low sexual drive. He doesn\u2019t feel like having sex. I\u2019ve even tried to initiate in ways that he used to like, doing certain foreplay things, etc. \n\nIn the past years to keep myself busy I started working out and also got a career in corporate tech world. I get hit on often at work and at the gym. And some very decent men also try to get to know me past a formal means. I always reject advances and proceed to tell everyone I\u2019m married. \n\nI love my husband but he\u2019s had a history of anger issues and it\u2019s recently been starting to come up again because of his exam stress. I thought our extensive individual and marital therapy was working but it was only good for a year. This has made me become a bit annoyed by his temper. \n\nSo, here is where it gets bad. My husbands sisters husband is in the same work field as me. He is 37f, but we always get along so so well. He\u2019s helped me get a job and helped me while I was in undergrad. He even pays for the gym membership of the gym I go to because I told him that one of my excuses for my not going to the gym was because of finances. \n\nThis guy is a brother figure to my husband but I\u2019m finding myself so attracted to him. \nMy husbands sister also has my husbands temper and anger issues and she doesn\u2019t treat her husband well and constantly yells at him Infront of everyone. He\u2019s just very kind and tender and mature so he deals with it. \n\nWe never hang out alone but I see him once every 3-4 days because my husband visits his sister and we all hang out but it\u2019s mostly him and I talking to each other while everyone hangs out on their phones. \n\nIm going on a conference trip with my husbands BIL, just the two of us. It\u2019s a 2 day conference for professionals in our field and he wants to mentor me and show me how to network. We\u2019re going to stay in a hotel and have separate rooms obviously, but I keep fantasizing. \n\nShame me because I know it\u2019s wrong to even think about it even I\u2019ve never acted on any cheating impulses.",

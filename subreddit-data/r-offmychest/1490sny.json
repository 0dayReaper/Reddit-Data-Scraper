    "postText": "Two years ago, I went off to college in another state. I don't have a lot of friends and the loneliness I feel there has been eating me up from the inside for a while now. I used to cry all the time, talking to people was hard, had to mentally prepare myself to get out of bed, skipped meals often and lost a little weight. I used to think that if I died right there in that hostel room, nobody would find me for hours, and that was also only because I had a roommate. I think I might have been depressed- even that made me feel so ashamed. There are much bigger problems in life than not having any friends. Why couldn't I just be happy on my own? From time to time, that feeling comes back and everything is much more difficult on those days. \n\nI was so sad when I left home and so homesick for a while. I thought that coming back home would solve it all, but every time I come home, something feels off. I'm the middle child and I don't think my family needs me as much as it did. I think they have gotten used to my absence. The relationship me and my mother used to share has transferred to my elder sister. I get sick a lot and I just feel like I burden them with my presence. For them, anything I achieve is inconsequential, anything I feel is irrelevant. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say with this long rant is: I don't feel at home, at home. I don't feel at home in my hostel room. I don't feel at peace with my family, my closest fiends. Right now, I feel like nobody in the whole world understands me. I'm scared that this feeling is going to follow me everywhere in life, even if I move to a different country. I don't think I've been happy in a long while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: if you've stayed till this point, thank you.",

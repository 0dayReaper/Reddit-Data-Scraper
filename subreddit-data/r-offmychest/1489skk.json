This drive me crazy \ud83d\ude2b everyday hurts since the break up.. I don\u2019t understand why he need to come talk with me about his life, cuz I definitely see him more trying to tell me about his life then curious about mine. Where I think is just him being doing what is the best for him, like she will be there to listen me or what? Why me?",

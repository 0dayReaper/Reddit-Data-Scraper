    "postText": "I (late 20s F) went on a first date with a guy (Mid 30s M) off a dating app recently. Went a lot longer than expected - 4 hours\u2026 didn\u2019t even realize it. We ended up holding hands quite a bit. At first it was a casual but pretty smooth af (here let me guide you through this crazy parking lot) and he noticed I was a little bit cold, so he offered his hand and I mentioned how warm and nice it was.  and getting comfortable sitting close especially since it was colder. \n\nLater we sat in his car and I was still a bit cold so he was a little bit touchier with the hand holding and feeling my arm and gave me a long hug to warm me up. Thankfully no pressure to escalate further \u2014 I am super new to properly dating even at my age. I\u2019ve been on less than 7 first dates my entire life. So this is surprising that I was able to relax in the company of a new guy without activating a fight or flight instinct \ud83e\udd72\n\nI have cold hands and arms because I\u2019m kinda iron deficient so it was sweet of him to care for me like that. It was nerve wracking holding hands in public but by the evens of the date it felt comfortable and after I got home I slept so well. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few days and I do miss those warm, gentle hands. Maybe the second date will have a bit more hand holding. Don\u2019t mind that kinda PDA esp if I\u2019m cold.",

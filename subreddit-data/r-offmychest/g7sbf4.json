    "postText": "He's been there since about the middle of October. \n\nWhen I first noticed him, the inclination was to squash, but the little guy could really run when he needed to so I decided to form a truce. It was pretty obvious that he wasn't too interested in humans, so as long as he stayed where he was, I'd leave him. It was getting cold outside and I felt bad about sending him out to die. So that was that. Hubby went after him a few more times but eventually gave up. He became a rent-paying household member, catching the gnats that flew down into his dark little corner.  \n\nI began talking to him, saying *hi,* things like that. He never ran when it was just us. He trusted me. \n\nHe would even wave back a time or two. \n\nThis morning I went to take a shower to get at the dead skin attacking my feet, and a bottle of body wash fell over the side of the tub into his web. I don't know what he was doing down there, he'd been spending a lot of time close to the ground lately. But I hate myself. I hate that I took a shower this morning, I hate that I didn't just stay in bed with my itchy feet. I hate that I got attached to a stupid spider and now I'm crying so hard I can't breathe. \n\nMost people make a throwaway for embarrassing shit like this but I'm gonna own it. That little spider taught me a powerful lesson about fear and friendship and I'll never forget it.",

One day my ex came over and saw bogart - decided the thing to do was slap his hand on the window- bogart never came back. I was heartbroken! I actually cried.\n\nETA - bogart and his cute little suction cup toes were outside on the window pane, the ex (and yeah, thats definitely part of it) was inside and slapped the glass hard. Bogart never returned to his window box home.",

We didn\u2019t use it at the company, but I personally have been using a product called Demon WP for many years. Mix it in a garden sprayer, it\u2019s a packet, dissolves in water. When applied according to the directions it\u2019s very pet and people friendly, kills the living fuck out of insects. I spray inside my house only if there\u2019s a problem, outside 3 times a year. Hasn\u2019t been a spider in my house new home since I moved in.\n\nEdit: If you are going to spray any pesticide around your home, read ever letter of the fucking directions, wear your fucking PPE, especially gloves. ESPECIALLY GLASSES. Long sleeves, closed toe shoes. Long pants, When applied according to the label, and only using the minimal amount of product necessary for the job, pesticides are safe. If the label says add one packet to one gallon of water for X amount of square feet, adding twice the amount won\u2019t kill twice the amount of spiders. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to use too much, that\u2019s why I recommend demon wp. One water soluble packet, one gallon of water. Kind of hard to fuck up.\n\nPro tip. Wear your fucking ppe. Asshole.",

She lived happily munching on all the earwigs and roly-poly bugs that found their way through the front door. I\u2019d talk to her when I got my purse or opened the closet to get dog food. \n\nAnd the first time I hired a cleaning lady, I forgot to tell her to leave Beatrice alone. I meant to but I just forgot. The second I walked in, I realized my mistake. I hurriedly opened the closet and was devastated that the cleaning lady did her job. I know it\u2019s silly but my only thought as I sat there crying was that I hope Beatrice didn\u2019t feel betrayed. :(",

One day I noticed a particularly fat orb spider had taken up residence, so I named him Pudge.\n\nEvery morning I\u2019d greet Pudge and ask him how his night was (he didn\u2019t say much). I\u2019d watch him wrap up his little bugs, I\u2019d grow concerned for him when storms would roll through and shake his web, but the overhang sheltered him nicely. It was nice to have a little companion. \n\nThen one day a sparrow came by and just like that, Pudge was gone. I remember watching his torn, empty web wafting in the breeze for weeks afterwards and I was so sad. Then some window washers came and all evidence of Pudge was gone forever. I don\u2019t know why I  felt so sad about a little spider outside my window, but I never forgot the little guy.",

Then, I told my stepfather, who promptly sprayed it with a shit ton of insecticide and destroyed its web :((\n\nThe other one was my good friend Lulu, who occupied the balcony area at my apartment. With no one to kill her, she enjoyed several months being my roommate. She was a garden orb weaver and frightening at first, but I came to become attached to her. She was very tidy and meticulous. Everyday she would tear down her web and spin an entirely new one with great attention to detail! It was a flawless web every time. \n\nRIP my spider friends \u2764\ufe0f",

It felt silly at the time to be sad about it but we were. She was a fun little buddy. I\u2019m sorry about your bathroom spider; I kind of understand where you\u2019re coming from.

One day I was telling a spider to leave!!! And he raised up his front legs in defiance. I surrendered and told them they could stay, but if they got in my bed it would mean death. I even set up a little \u201cshrine\u201d on a table for them, and they set up their webs there almost exclusively! Our arrangement worked somehow, they left me alone so I left them alone. \n\nBefore I moved, I started dating this guy and at one point he came into my room and I warned him about the spider shrine and the arrangement we had come to. He was equal parts endeared and impressed. This was about 6 years ago and we\u2019re getting married soon lol.\n\nAnyway, I think spiders are intelligent and I don\u2019t want to be on the hit list for the spider mafia. So.. spider.. shrine...\n\n*EDIT: rent was $200/mo, roommates were great, I was there for 3 years until the basement flooded, and hobo spider bites aren\u2019t usually strong enough to pierce human skin.

Seriously no other spider was seen in that room for two years! He helped me a lot with my arachnophobia. One day I found him curled up death on my desk and I was so sad. This happened more than a decade ago but obviously I still remember him. Soon after his death the random spiders came back hunting my place. My arachnophobia came back slowly and got worse year for year since his death.\n\nI tried to befriend other spiders who seem to be housebroken to calm me down again but they\u2019re rare and none of them was as reliable as Max. Had once one in the bathroom and called her Maxine in his honor, turned out she layed eggs after a month. Clear truce break. Noped out of this.\n\nLast year another candidate got a chance. George. He lived next to the entrance and kept the truce very well. Every time I left I said bye and every time I got home I said hello. Sometimes he went missing but was always back in his corner the next day. One day he came back with only 7 legs so I assume he fought of another spidey or something like that, \u2018cause once again I noticed less random spiders around since George moved in. 2 months ago George went missing again, defending the realm, but he never came back... George was with me for 9 months and I miss him like I miss Max.",

            "comment": "I am not alone in the universe!!!\n\n3 years ago, I noticed a very large house spider in the corner of the bathroom window. It never left its web (that I saw) and always ducked out of sight when someone came into the room. Spiders are not generally welcome indoors and I don't particularly like them, but I felt that this one respected boundaries for some reason. \n\nMonths went by and my girlfriend never noticed, so I let the spider alone. Every now and then I'd catch it peeking out at me. After a few more weeks, I named it Georgina. I noticed how it/she would gobble up flies, which is aces in my book. I even began to feed her flies with a set of tweezers \u2013 when she heard the fly's buzzing wings, she'd pop out of her hidey-hole and grab it from me.\n\nAnd then I began to feel some kind of weird affection for the damned thing. Georgina stayed with us for almost 2.5 years before my girlfriend finally noticed and cleaned up her dusty web (complete with dismembered fly parts), and then Georgina disappeared for good. I'm not going to say I mourned, but I did feel some kind of strange sideways loss.",

I wanted to name the jack rabbits and bunnies I see in my neighbourhood but my (loving) husband said that I\u2019ll be devastated should they ever disappear or what have you... you are good people, OP.",

I taught my kids that the spiders were all my friends and were there keeping an eye on them and keeping the monsters away when I can't be there. We gave them names and I'd make a point to say hello to them whenever I was around to put my kids to bed. Now that they're older they now know that the spiders keep away the flies and mosquitoes that come around to bite them.",

            "comment": "I am a huge arachnophobic. Surprisingly, this happened to me too, but in my left car mirror. I named him Larry. He was outside so I couldn\u2019t get him but he just chilled and lived in my mirror. Every time I opened the window or got out of the car, Larry made sure to hurry his lil butt into the mirror for me. The first time I saw him, I was horrified because he was on the bigger side and was a spider. With our understanding of staying in the mirror and out of my car, I had respect for him. He lived in the mirror for about a year. I would know he was there because there was a web on my mirror and stayed there/kept getting rebuilt. In the past 3 months, I noticed the web wasn\u2019t there anymore and didn\u2019t come back so I\u2019m sure it was Larry\u2019s time to go. When I first noticed it, I told my parents and they were like \u201cwho tf is Larry?\u201d but knew after I said it was the spider.",

            "comment": "I feel you OP. I used to stay in a bedsit-style work accommodation in Japan and after a while a few geckos made their home by my front door. I was so excited because I never see lizards in the UK. After a while an entire family of them was squatting with me. I used to chat to them and cry to them when I was upset. A few of them moved into my bathroom area and used to sit at the top of the walls when I showered. Unfortunately, because of the Japanese style wet-room shower and the age of my accommodation, the drainage was bad and the bathroom would fill with water mid-way up my legs. My lizard friends disappeared. The next day I found their little corpses on my bathroom floor, they must have fallen from the wall and drowned. It was very sad, I really missed them after that.",

I still allow nice spiders to inhabit my home coz they eat flies and mosquitoes for me, and then I can relate to them my days when I\u2019m bored or lonely. It\u2019s a nice relationship because the spider just \u201clistens\u201d. Idc if it makes me crazy. Imma keep doing it lol...also, where do you all think Charlotte\u2019s Web originated? From a weird-ass relationship that\u2019s what and it was Goddang beautiful.",

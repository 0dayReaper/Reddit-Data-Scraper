    "postText": "Okay my username says all you need to know about me. I met my daughter while on a business trip she tracked me down (she's 14 so she's clearly very resourceful) my marriage is not good. My wife and I have an open one but really that's an excuse we both use. Needless to say the girl is from another woman.\n\nI have had a DNA test done so I know for a fact she is mine. Her mom is a sex worker I see often. So I'm probably going to be having a conversation with her sooner or later. Her mom is currently in the hospital because her step dad beat her.\n\nThat's why my kid tracked me down. In the few weeks I'm known the kid I've been looking at my life and choices. I mean I have kids but the oldest with my wife is 10. So, it's kind of a new experience I haven't had a talk with my wife either tried calling home but the house staff told me she's in one of her moods which means she's either to drunk or high to be coherent.\n\nMy wife's not dangerous just broken due to trauma she spends most of her time in bed, with friends and if not either of those she's in rehab. I don't even know how she's going to take the news and having a member of the staff relay the news seemed rude.\n\nI've been rethinking my actions and I feel guess I feel regret over how being an overall jerk has impacted people in my life. What makes me feel like a bigger jerk is that it took my daughter asking me questions about my life to really see how selfish I've been in life.",

She is you kid there is nothing you can do about it, take it or leave it. \n\nIn the case you want to help your daughter and her mom , I would suggest that you offer her mom a position on your house staff to get her away form the abuse. In that way you can get to know your daughter",

Welcome her into your life, but before you introduce her to your other kids, get counseling on how to do it. Take it slowly. Stop being a jerk.",

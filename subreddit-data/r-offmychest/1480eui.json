    "postText": "I (16m) and her (15f) had a perfect relationship we had dated for about 6 months and everything was going amazingly, we hadn\u2019t argued once and life was genuinely perfect and happy, she was so very pretty and I wanted to spend every moment of my life with her.   Two days ago, she stated it was better if we just stay friends and that she was sorry, this caught me completely off guard Because the relationship was going really smoothly. As a guy I don\u2019t cry that much but I guess the shock really got me because I started sobbing and was trying to look for a reason as to why she would say this, I asked her if she wanted a break or a breakup, to which she replied break. I was content with a break because I loved her that much I\u2019d do what I could to stay with her. I spent the whole of yesterday overthinking. We barely talked throughout the day until that night when she said she was cutting contact and that it was for the best for both of us,  I had never panicked and sobbed so much in my life , I begged her not to but nothing stopped her. I tried to kill myself that night by overdosing but my mother walked in as I was taking them.    I woke up today and I can\u2019t stop crying and I cannot get her out of my head.",

You need some professional help if your emotions are that out of control. \n\nYour ex-girlfriend didn\u2019t seem to give much of a reasoning other that \u201cit\u2019s best for the both of you\u201d.",

Teens breaking up, with or without reason, happens but you wanting to end your life because if it most definitely needs addressed. Please talk to your mom!! Best wishes!!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m really sorry for what you\u2019re going through man. And as much as I wish I could comfort you right now I really think you need to hear some facts. First, you are young! There\u2019s so much more to life than one girl. Since you are young you only deal with what is in front of you, however in reality you are going to go so far in life and meet people that are so much better for you! \n\nAlso, you say you want to spend every moment of your life with her, but I do believe you deserve better! If it was meant to be I promise you you\u2019d find someone who is willing to be with you through thick and thin no matter what\u2026 or at least communicate with you rather than catching you off guard - in my option that\u2019s really selfish and inconsiderate. How you felt was perfectly normal and usual when getting caught lacking by someone with such poor intent. \n\nI promise you bro, IT GETS BETTER. My personal advice is not to make anything official or do anything sexual at that age, but if you choose to, take it with a grain of salt. You are both so so young and you need time to mature. \n\nIn terms of the future, you deserve so much better none the less. Please realize that this is not a problem that has anything to do with you and it\u2019s NOTHING you should be ashamed of. It honestly seems like this was her loss. She had someone genuinely care for her and she threw it out the window. Put that good love into someone who will do the same for you back. Someone who is willing to put up with whatever goes on in your personal and mental life, someone who will appreciate your physical self, insecurities, you on an absolute good day and an absolute bad day. Good relationships consist of good communication, and the two of you versus the problem not a 1v1. Please make yourself aware of what you deserve and be patient. Better things ahead lil bro, DMs always open\u2764\ufe0f",

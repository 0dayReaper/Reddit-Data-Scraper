    "postText": "I'm still in the process of moving out of my old place. It's like working a third job, consuming what little time and attention that I have left over. \n\nNext week, I'll be able to finally close that chapter my turning in my keys and leave them my forwarding address to wrap up everything. \n\nThe time in between now and then? Both slow and endless while extremely fast. While I'm going through each day, time seems to crawl by slowly, each hour taking an eternity. But then, when the day is over and I'm either on my way home or to my second shift, that's when early evening turns to midnight in a fraction of a second. I drive on the highway thinking that I have at least 3-4 hours before bedtime, then as soon as I walk in the door, I'm having to vacuum my dinner down my throat and then hop into bed instantly because 5:45pm quickly turned into 10:30pm within a matter of seconds. \n\nWhat the fuck??\n\nPerhaps it's a combination of exhaustion, burnout, stress ... I'd give anything to rest right now. Not necessarily to sleep, but to just sit there and think without any demands on my time or attention. \n\nOh well ...\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

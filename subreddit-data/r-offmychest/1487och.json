I figured this would be a good place to send my amends into the universe and if the person who it is meant for sees it then cool. :)\n\nC, I want to apologize for depending on you to fix everything that was wrong with me. I relied on you for far too much and it was really unfair. I\u2019m sorry that I left my mental health untreated for so many years while we lived together. It was so wrong of me to make my anxiety, panic, and constant need for reassurance your problem. You were struggling and I was so selfish I never ever inquired about what was going on with you. I\u2019m sorry that I switched to heavy drinking after years of abusing Kratom. I\u2019m sorry that my drinking also caused me to become such a mean and volatile person. My living amends is that, I will continue onto my fourth year of therapy. I will continue attending the DBT treatment center and my recovery meetings. I will not put another person in the same situation as I put you in. I am genuinely sorry for everything. Im happy to see you\u2019re happy now with a beautiful wife. You deserve it!",

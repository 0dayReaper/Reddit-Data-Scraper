    "postText": "I\u2019m 35F and I have 4 kids and in a bad relationship with my spouse of 13 years. It has been rough to say the least. There is so much to write. Long story short I am dependent on him as I am a stay at home mom with two small kids and two school aged kids. I thought since we would both be home more often we would be okay this is while he ran his small business being a handyman/lawn services. The verbal abuse the past physical abuse from both parties is just taking a toll on me. My kids see how he is his attitude and how is just plain out mean. He sleeps all day when not on jobs. He says I\u2019m lazy and fat and doesn\u2019t do anything. He says I\u2019m dead weight and doesn\u2019t need my help on jobs bc I offer bc it\u2019s hard for just one person (him). He doesn\u2019t have any employees it\u2019s just him. He is so mean to me. Calling me names and saying I\u2019m a bad mom. I used to work as a legal assistant in the legal field. I\u2019m a full time student we both are online only. I do my work his work and everything. It\u2019s exhausting. I cry so much my eyes hurt and are drying out and itches. I have left before, he has left before before he used to email me saying he missed me. Now it\u2019s me just wanting to fix it all and be a family. Why bc and I just not contact him why what is wrong with me!?  Every time he says we are done every day and still expects sexual things to be done to him only. I\u2019m so depressed I\u2019m so lost I\u2019m so everything you can think of. May of last year we got into a fight because he got drunk bragging that he had a underage gf and I thought ew gross. He said he was with a lady who had a 18 year old daughter and the lady accused him of trying to get to the daughter. He likes girls tik toks and I can see it they are all young like 17/18. He is 40. He has a 18 year old daughter and when she was 15/16 she was visiting with older brother and I was out of town I could see the cameras inside and her aunt made her a margarita bc it was a holiday celebration I saw him pouring her his beer which is stronger. After that she never came back. She was crying to her mom. I always feel like something happened. Going back to May he told me get off my dick b-word! That night I took pills and according to ems/hospital I almost died. I had to be intubated and stayed in hospital with a sitter. I made a mistake but how can this man not see I love him and want us. I never have tried to take my own life. Never will I do that again. I just wanted to be done like he wanted and wanted to be with my grandpa who passed. When I came back home all he said was he missed me. I found out he was commenting and talking to girls on tiki tok especially a friend of mine. He claims didn\u2019t know. He refuses to delete app. He said he\u2019s doing nothing that I\u2019m not doing. I feel like I need help from someone who can show me and my kids a better life like for example I wrote to Kim Kardashian since she helped ppl out. I asked her if she would help me get away from him but to stay away. Move states. No contact whatsoever. Is it bad that I just want us my family the way we were it was good at one point but this hurt hurts so much. Im not on talking terms with my family. He doesn\u2019t like them. They too have hurt me a lot. Taking 10,000 dollars from me. Making threats that they would take my house and kids away. I\u2019ve let myself go completely my eyes hurt and are dark like black eyes. My heart can\u2019t take no more like medically. My heart hurts so much. I get shocks from it like girl. I\u2019m sorry for blabbing thanks if you read it this far.",

Look into domestic violence shelters and services in the area. I just read a very similar story and the woman was lucky to get out alive with her children to a safe place. This type of abuse can escalate quickly!! You\u2019re children should absolutely not being seeing any of this. If you don\u2019t have friends or family you trust, then reach out to a shelter for help. They have more resources than you may think. \n\nPLEASE do this for you &amp; your children!!! You\u2019ve got to take the first step to change your life!!! Offering you hugs!",

    "postText": "Possible triggers - depression, toxic parents\n\nAlso want to note that I know I\u2019m privileged.  I have a good job, health insurance, and the ability to take my kids to urgent care as needed. \n\nSo yea, I\u2019m (34f) getting better thanks to medication and my support system, but I\u2019ve accepted in the last so many months that I\u2019m extremely depressed.  I feel like typing this out will feel good.\n\nIt\u2019s really weird because on some level, this is the best my life has ever been.  I have what I always wanted (loving husband, two amazing/healthy kids, a job that allows me to take care of my family\u2026I\u2019m so thankful for all this in my life), but I\u2019m realizing that I\u2019ve been depressed for the last 3yrs or so since the birth of my first born.  \n\nI tried so much to feel like myself again.  Changed my hair (hadn\u2019t done much to it in about 10yr), bought some new clothes.  These helped a little; I think it helped because I was investing in myself/trying to feel good in my skin again.  I ended up getting a new job last March.  Issues with the old job (lots of stress/not much money).  New job pays more and is less stress.  All that said, none it \u201cfixed\u201d the problem.  \n\nI\u2019ve been aware that I need to go back to therapy. Especially since the birth of my second as watching the two kids interact and grow together now is triggering a lot of childhood trauma.  I see them and love them so much.  How could my mom do that to me??? How could my dad think it\u2019s ok to text me nasty stuff when I\u2019m only weeks postpartum??? (Basically texted me that I\u2019m awful and disrespectful/need to honor thy father.). \n\nIf you are unaware of the mental health system in the US, let me tell ya\u2026it\u2019s crazy.  I\u2019m actually lucky that I have an appointment (got it scheduled about a month ago)\u2026a lot of ppl are waitlists that last 10+ months.   I went through my health insurance app\u2026just directed me to medication mediation ppl that I didn\u2019t know till I called and they basically told me \u201cnope, wrong place\u201d.  The second (or third?) person I tried to get a hold of, also did not do therapy, but I didn\u2019t know that and no one caught on till I was in front of that person.  The good part- they got me on medication (by this point, I needed it/need it as I breakdown every time I\u2019m honest about my feelings). They also connected me with a social worker, who helped me get the right info of places to call in the area for therapy. (Big takeaway from this for ppl trying to get help- just go to your doctor. They have so much info that I wished were more accessible). \n\nNow onto life- kids are sick all the time.  My husband and I fear losing our jobs because we have to take so much time off.  I\u2019ve actually just started taking them to the doctor (urgent care is the only option because there are no open appts), so I could get doctor notes for work to prove I\u2019m not lying (they didn\u2019t ask for one, but I feel like I need to prove I\u2019m not lying\u2026 anxiety much? Lol)  we have no pto.  It\u2019s been so bad that my husband had to make up hours during holidays. My husband gets 5weeks of pto at the start of the year\u2026he\u2019s down to like two days for the rest of the year.  \n\nWe have to get a new engine in our car.  Luckily it\u2019s covered by warranty (like the 3rd time in history that the warranty was actually useful).   Yea, we get a free loaner but only after two weeks with a rental as I try to figure out how to get a car moved 40miles the cheapest manner possible.  Add all that with whatever else they are finding with the car and we are out $3000.  (Which isn\u2019t a lot in the grand scheme, but we\u2019re also trying to save for a house and we need to replace our other car\u2026.it\u2019s too much). \n\nNow, let\u2019s add it all together (perfect example of what I mean by life needs to chill). Last Wednesday, I got it all figured out on how to tow my car as cheap as possible\u2026I\u2019ll add to the comments because everyone needs to know.  I had to stay home for it to get picked up\u2026then I get a call about 2pm\u2026my kids have fevers.  I just took a day off for my car, now kids?!??  My anxiety got so bad that my ibs was the worst it\u2019s ever been and I thought I was sick too.  Guess what was supposed to happen that Wednesday??? My first therapy session.  Didn\u2019t go because I thought was sick.  Its just that I get so close to taking care of myself, improving my ability to take care of my family (firm believer in \u201cI can take care of those around me a lot better, if I\u2019m taken care of\u201d). Thankfully I was able to to get another appt for tomorrow. \n\nI know I\u2019ll make it through this and I know the medication is helping.  My life feels like a soap opera sometimes/that I\u2019m making everything up.",

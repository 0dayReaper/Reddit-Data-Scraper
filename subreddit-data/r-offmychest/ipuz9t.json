    "postText": "18 Months ago I had, and recovered from testicular cancer. A week ago I got the news that it is back, and it's in my lymphnodes.\n\nToday my wife, twenty weeks pregnant with our wonderful down syndrome daughter Emilia Hazel went in for her checkup and ultrasound, to find no heartbeat. This is the second baby girl we have lost mid pregnancy. Tomorrow we have to go in, and my poor wife has to deliver the remains of our child in a room with strangers, and I'm terrified I will have to sit in the parking lot outside because of Covid and the morons in this country who won't do what is needed to resolve this.\n\nI just want to die. Everything in my life is ashes, and I am an empty broken man.\n\nEDIT:  I am by my wife's side. Some time tonight I will hold my daughter for the first and last time.",

But I am, indeed, so very sorry for your loss and the terrible news of your diagnosis. There are no words one could say that will ever make you feel better. But I truly hope you and your wife find solace during this unbelievably terrible time and I hope with all my heart that you recover from this and are able to move on with your life happy and at peace.",

I so wish they could have met their grandkids and seen me get married! They were the best people I knew, and I was so so lucky they chose me to be their child and that I got to have them as my parents. Adoption is 100% a beautiful thing.",

His mother started losing his mind, treating him horribly, forcing him to take drowsy pills so she doesn't need to deal with him or his \"Squeaky Voice\". She did a lot more. but about 5 months ago she just dipped on him to go \"Take care of her father\" with his sister. Left him with us... Few weeks later we adopted him and it was all for the best. Now he's way happier, in a healthier place. He was diagnosed with cancer about a month ago, but he's fighting.   \n\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. I'm sorry you got your cancer back. Just keep on fighting though, I know it may seem like there is no good and there never will be good, but people who go through the most, and still fight, last the longest. This is certainly hard, but don't let it ruin you. Keep trying, keep fighting, and if you need to adopt, then adopt. It's a long hard road, but you got this. You've come this far. Prayers &amp; Best wishes for you and your family from me and my entire family. Thinking of you.",

You still have your wife and child you know. This is the time that you need each other the most.\n\nI know these are just empty words from an Internet stranger but deleting yourself doesn't really solve anything.",

Life is inexplicable and unfair. All I can say is that you will always be in my prayers and I hope that somehow through these words you can feel this little bit of positive energy, from some corner of this world, to get you through this time. I have a family member who is suffering from cancer, and I know the toll it takes on you. Just know that for every ship that is seemingly fighting tough seas, there is the eventual comfort of seeing a lighthouse. You have to stay focussed on your lighthouse and I'm sure you will one day find yourself in a better place. \n\nMore than anything else, you have to be there for your wife. She needs you to be with her more than ever.",

My wife and I had just suffered through our 4th miscarriage and I was with a shit chain of command that would publicly state that \"if a wife had not had kids she was just a long term girlfriend with housing benefits\".  The doctors had determined that in addition to not walking when I used to be a super soldier that a previous injury/allergic reaction to a pre-deployment immunization had rendered me unable to father healthy children and that the chance of us having a child even make it to birth was virtually impossible.  \n\nThat was almost 15 years ago.  I walk unassisted now.  I can bike 4-6 miles depending upon the day.  I can jog 1-3, some days I can even run a mile or more.  No where near the speed I used to run, no where near the distances.  Know what is best of all?  Our daughter is 13 and perfect.  She scores in the top 3-5% nationwide on national standardized tests.  At 13 she is already getting college prospect inquiries.  She is also creative and loves art though she has a twisted sense of humor and loves puns and dad jokes.\n\nNever stop fighting brother.  You can do this.  Love and talk with your wife.  Have each others backs.  Talk, listen, love and live.  You can do it.",

I know plenty of ppl that had to try more then once or twice. My mother work with human fertility, so I\u00b4ve heard plenty of cases that took a while.\n\nHang in there bro!",

I know - He has been my saving grace through all that life has harshly dished  out.  Right now - through your pain and hurt you may not be able to open up to Him.  You might even be angry at God for all of this.  So know you are being covered by many others during this time.  \u201cGod is the healer of all our diseases\u201d - He has for me and He will for you.  Through all of my pain one piece the doctors - yes doctors in two different places said, \u201cLet Go, Let God!\u201d  Years of prayer daily - I am learning to give it all to Him.  Our Lord is turning things around in life for better - beauty for ashes they call it.  Now, the pain of my life is being used to help others who have needs.  God is able!  \u2764\ufe0f",

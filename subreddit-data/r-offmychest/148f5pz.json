And one of them has a full mailbox. I\u2019m so upset. \n\nThis is quite possibly the worst time for me to get sick. I had to leave my current job early and this flu has put me out of business for the past three days. I would be angry if I had the energy. It\u2019s taking an effort to type this up.",

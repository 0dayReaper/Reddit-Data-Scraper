    "postText": "This is gonna be a ramble, and I\u2019m sorry for any grammar errors, I\u2019m a bit drunk.\n\n\nService industry workers will understand this better than most but I (19F) love cooking, god I love it so much. It makes me so happy? I feel so fufilled doing it. I love being a cook. Dispite the shitty hours, the physical demand, and all of it, I love it so much. Mind body and soul, working the line is my passion. But fuck, I had to leave the place I gave it all to. 8am to 12am the next day, never a word of complaint. I was more than happy to do it. More than happy to do all that was expected of me an more, fuck I loved that place so much. But they chose the drunk over me.\n\nThey chose the asshole (30 M) who would call out for a week straight, the guy who caused us to fail a health inspection, the asshole who would fuck up everything he touched. The guy who made comments to both of my managers while drunk about how luck one was to get to fuck me (he didn\u2019t know that we where dating at the time, no one did). About how sexy I was and how he wishes he could tap that, they guy who screamed at me for being rude when I told him politely I didn\u2019t need his help. The guy who\u2019s slack I had to pick up. They chose him over me, and it caused my unshakable determination to shatter. \n\nI live the rush, the pace. I live how culinary is a puzzle I\u2019ll never fully solve, but enough prices will fall into place to keep me going, but fuck, I was promised. I was promised the harassment wouldn\u2019t happen there then it did, and they chose him over me. \n\nThis was the only thing I wanted, the thing I was so sure would be for me forever, and he caused me to falter, to hate working, to hate it all. \n\nHow do I get it back? How do I get my resolve back? I want it back? I feel like my whole world is collapsing around me and I want it back so bad.\n\n\nSorry again for the rambling but fuck, it feels like no one understands. All the chefs I talk to are male and have next to no idea about who the harassment is so dehumanizing, most women tell me it\u2019s not worth it. \n\nI would sell my soul to have my resolve back, but now I question every decision I make and it\u2019s fucking me up mentally, emotionally and physically.",

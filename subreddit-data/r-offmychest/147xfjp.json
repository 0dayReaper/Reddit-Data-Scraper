    "postText": "In the 12th grade, our English teacher made us do an assignment where we wrote letters to our future selves. After writing and putting the letters in envelopes, they would stay in her possession until five years had passed and she would mail them to us. Today, I received the letter I wrote five years ago. \n\nI feel awful, oddly enough. I know I'm not beholden to the hopes and dreams of a high school senior but I feel like I fell short of who I wanted to be. \n\nI wrote about some more superficial things like what my favorite book was or my favorite tv show. However, I also wrote about goals of mine and things I wanted to improve about myself. The bolded text below are excerpts from the letter. \n\n**\"Hey. Do you still do stuff last minute?\"**\n\nThis part made me smile. I started off the letter, guns blazing, asking if I am still a procrastinator. \n\n**\"Do you still have issues trusting people?\"**\n\nOuch! This has actually gotten worse and it's painful to think about. I can't seem to open up to anyone these days, not even a therapist. \n\n**\"Hopefully when I'm 22, I'll be graduating college?\"**\n\nThis hurt. My younger self was right to phrase this as a question because I have not graduated. Basically, I left school two years ago to pursue an apprenticeship in tech at a large tech company. While it's still great to have that on my resume, the tech job market is.....not what it was two years ago. I signed up for classes today at my local community college and after, I'll transfer to a four year school. \n\nI try to remind myself that everyone is on their own path but it really sucks that I haven't reached this life milestone yet. \n\n**\"Another goal is that I'd be less socially anxious\"** \n\nI'm still working on this one. \n\n**\"I hope the family is doing okay\"**\n\nAs a seventeen year old writing this letter, I didn't know I only had three years left until my older brother would kill himself. Obviously, nothing has been the same since. I don't even know what to say.\n\n**TL;DR:** If today has taught me anything, it's that five years isn't as long as it sounds. I may not have the external things to show for it like a degree or robust social life, but I still think I've grown and changed a lot since I was 17. I just want to live in such a way that my 27 year old self can look back and not feel as bad as I feel right now. ",

All went to shit after 17 when I was diagnosed with depression. I spent the next 10 years basically bedridden, playing video games, and developing substance addictions. I've only now started to fix my life up. I went back to college a few months ago. I was 27.\n\nIf you asked 17 year old me where I would be at 27, I would've said \"a famous celebrity or CEO with billions of dollars\" \ud83e\udd23. I eventually stopped feeling bad about myself when I realized that I had another 30 years to do everything I wanted to do in this life. Though, on my low days, I do admit it gets hard to remind myself of this.\n\nMore often than not, life doesn't pan out the way we want it to. That's just life. We just have to struggle on and hope for the best. Well, I'm sure you've figured this out on your own \ud83d\ude42",

That's a good trait, it means you can improve.\n\nTry to be happy with the progress you've made. 5 years is a very short time. You will achieve the goals that truly matter to you.\n\nKeep on keeping on.",

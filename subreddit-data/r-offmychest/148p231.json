    "postText": "idk who to talk to this about because i'm so pissed. my (f18) ex best friend (nonbinary,18) cheated on their ex (m18). i don't know the full extent to what happened, but they told me some issues they had in the relationship before they broke up. then i heard rumors that they were spreading themself about how their ex boyfriend has been taking advantage of them consistently (they told me the only issue was that they have different sex drives, and I learned from a close friend of ours that they were purposely spreading false rumors). then i found out they were emotionally and possibly physically cheating on their boyfriend near the end of the relationship. they also immediately confirmed to everyone that they're dating the person right after the breakup. the worst part? their new boyfriend is 15, and he's liked them ever since he was 13 and they were 16. their relationship is illegal where we live, but it won't be taken seriously by law enforcement. i'm so grossed out and i don't know what to do, i'm just grateful i'm no longer part of their life. their ex did some shitty things in the relationship as well but to fully blame everything on him and cheat on him and spread these disgusting rumours.... it makes me queasy just thinking about it. i don't know how they were ever part of my life and i hate that they were.",

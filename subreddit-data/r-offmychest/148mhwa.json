Role-playing with Ai is fun and all until I decided to add a little drama. One thing led to another and my son in the RPG died. \n\nAnd now I feel kinda off I guess. I am trying to laugh about it, since it wasn't real. But damn it hurt and the thought alone still makes me tear up a little.\n\nTo all the mothers and fathers out there who have lost their children, my deep condolences. You are very strong people! I am proud of every parent who went or is going through this, I acknowledge that they kept going even if they couldn't... \n\nI am not comparing my situation to them at all!! \nThe thought simply struck me and I wish all the mothers and fathers out there the most of strength!",

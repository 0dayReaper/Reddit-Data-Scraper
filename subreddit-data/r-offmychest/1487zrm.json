    "postText": "So my [attractive conventially] friend gets asked out by almost everyone she meets,  not a lot of people but she only socializes so much. 4 or 5 boys she knows, all ended up with a situationship at least. And being friends with her is so easy and obvious for all who meet her. Its bcoz she is attractive. Even if there interests dont match, they are instantly friends. \nI'm happy for her and idk. But here comes the realization. She tries to introduce me to the people she knows. It's not an instant friend thing coz yes being good looking matters. So many opinion and decisions are made deciding by how you look. Subconsciously or consciously. And she would never know, coz attractive \nShe can approach anyone she finds attractive, while I've to ensure I won't ask someone out of league coz they'd be embarrassed. The list Goes on.\nI really don't bother anymore, but pretty privilege never was so clear to me.",

    "postText": "Let me start with some self-humility, I am gay as shit, I have a certain degree of love for everybody, but I also hate a lot of morons.\n\nBut the thing I hate the most is that ALOTTA people think their identities consists of who you like to have relations with. Do you play Golf? Do you like to eat Italian food? Chinese food? Do you wish to adopt? Do you have a religion? Lots of cases it is a very uninteresting conversation. They don\u2019t talk about what they cooked, or where they went. Just horny bullshit. I want to connect with someone.\n\nI don\u2019t want to smoke weed/some other drug that you need all the time (I don\u2019t have a word because for some reason that isn\u2019t synonymous with addiction) I don\u2019t want to get wasted and have sex. \n\nI want to connect. Then do it. What the fuck is happening? Why can\u2019t I be gay and meet people who have hobbies besides doing drugs and talking about our lifestyles consistently. Tired of going on dates.\n\nThis shit just doesn\u2019t feel good or correct to me. It has been becoming increasingly an occurring thought that I just don\u2019t even want to be gay anymore.",

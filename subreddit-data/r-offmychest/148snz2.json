    "postText": "i just dk what to do anymore or how to act. idk how i\u2019m feeling either. it just feels weird to live as myself, to view things from my own perspective, to be an individual looking at life through my own eyes. idk if that makes sense, it\u2019s sort of an existential thing. sometimes, things don\u2019t feel real either. \ni just can\u2019t anymore idk what to do. my therapist is bad and she\u2019s not helping at all, no one and nothing is helping. idk i just need to solve this issue. it\u2019s very tiring. and it feels like when i\u2019m stressed it adds to it. and sometimes, i feel like a tingling numbness (yk when u sit on ur leg for too long and it feels tingly? yeah that) out of nowhere and it can last days. then it goes away weirdly. \nidk what\u2019s happening to me and i wanna stop feeling like this bc i can\u2019t anymore.\nif anyone knows something that can help me some advice would be great.",

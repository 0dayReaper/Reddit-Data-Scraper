    "postText": "As much as I try, I can't keep a positive mindset when it comes to dating. Especially seeing everyone else have success while I don't. I think due to my lack of experience at 24, it makes it hard for me to put myself out there due to past rejections, and the fact that everyone else has more experience. I think even if I got in a relationship, I would still be bitter due to the experiences I missed out on. I'll be honest, I wish I could find a girl in the exact scenario I'm in, so I could have a fresh start with someone on equal grounds.",

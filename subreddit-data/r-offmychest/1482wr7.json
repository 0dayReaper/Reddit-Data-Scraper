    "postText": "At my sister's bridal shower, they were giving her advice on marriage. One that stood out to me was about marrying your best friend. Without a beat, unprompted, the thought \"I fucked up\" came up. He would say he thinks I treat him like a best friend, and I would say, lovers and friends. Looking back, it was hard to be a lover when I hated myself. It's no wonder he didn't feel it. I knew I had to change. I was already losing weight, but now reading, meditating, cleaning, practicing communication, and intentionally seeing that all is full of love. The weight loss and maca powder made me feel more myself again, bringing back my libido. All my unhealthy habits and negative beliefs had to change. I also had to accept and forgive myself. \n\nOf course, I still love him and will keep going forward. I hope he's brave enough to work on himself without jumping into another relationship to escape from dealing with himself, or the cop in his mind will continue to haunt him. He would realize he is loveable, intelligent, funny, talented, and kind. He's more than enough; he was Venus as a boy. When he gets out of his own way and sees how great he is, he will be a powerful force to be reckoned with. I just would have hoped he would know who I am now and becoming. And maybe vice versa, but I may be asking too much. Or he'll hate that I even wrote this and still wants nothing to do with me. But it's over, and he is done with me. I ate strawberries and threw them up as I had a sick stomach feeling we were over. I really did hope we could have come back together when we grew into ourselves.\n\nI resent you calling me mentally strong because you make it seem effortless for me and that you are not strong enough to do it. I believe you can do it, but it's nothing if you don't believe it. I was about to leave this world, and the thought of losing you brought me back to life. I remembered how you loved me, which ignited my fire for life and love again. You were beautiful. Your touch, your smile, you being you. I have thought of no one else but you. Stopped using toys but think of you moving in me to get me going. I wouldn't have been ready for you to move back in. I would have wanted you to get to know me again gradually. Take me on dates, and I'll wear those cute summer dresses that I am now feeling confident in. Get to know I can really love and lust for you. But we are over and done. You can still see Kitty without me there. But you won't because of your new situation. I became more of what you wanted me to be, but it's also who I wanted to be. Through it all, I was loyal and loved you this whole time. Ah, here is the sick-to-my-stomach feeling again. I got more work to do.",

    "postText": "My husband and I just got married and we're looking for a modest home to start a family in. We are living in NJ and every affordable home within an hour radius of his job (~$350 or less) is in a 55+ adult community. I'm fucking livid and I don't even know why we need THIS MANY adult communities in this one area of NJ??!\n\nI understand the tax breaks they get and I'm sure the builders just want to get paid to build homes no matter what community they're in, but I think it's fucking insane that only the rich and elderly are able to have a house at this point. \n\nWorse yet, both of our parents are on our asses to \"get out of the apartment, stop pissing away rent money and get a house! Mortgages are cheaper anyway!\" when the only mortgages we can get outside of a 55+ community are double what we pay in rent for only 1 more bedroom and an extra half bath. What the actual fuck.",

We live in a small 2-bedroom and I considered upgrading before because I wanted a bigger kitchen and a 3rd room as a home office since I WFH. And then the housing market exploded and places were twice as expensive as before. My husband and I are childfree so we just decided to stay put. I wonder if the house prices will calm down eventually.",

Insurance deemed our place \"livable\" because technically there was access to a stove even if it was surrounded by mold and water cleanup work, and we had to get our own secondary apartment until the work was done. If it weren't covid housing market insanity when the work was done, we would have taken a massive loss on reselling the place once all the fees and payments were done. We luckily only lost 15k, which is crazy to say that that was lucky after the nightmare.\n\nNow we live in an apartment with neurotic landlords who are over as soon as you say \"weird noise\" and couldn't be happier. We're going new build next time, don't trust that just because something was maintained doesn't mean that bad renovations haven't secretly happened in the walls.",

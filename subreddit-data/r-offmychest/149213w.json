    "postText": "I will begine by saying my children are safe with me and I don't abuse or mistreat them. Having them my choice, the worst I ever made.\n\nI have two children (2 and 3 years old). I thought I wanted to have children but even from my first pregnancy I had no luck feeling conected to them. I gave birth and I felt nothing, only sadness that I destroyed my life. I had the second one because my husband wanted an other child and I thought that maybe the pregnancy hormones would help me but no. All the same. \n\nIn the past 3 years I've become a shadow of a person. I try so hard to put on a happy face and suffer in silence but I can't keep doing it until the love comes or I die as I'd hoped. I have hardly left my house in 3 years, I've gotten almost no sleep and I now weight less than 90 pounds. My favourite time if the week is the one hour my kids sleep at the same time and I get to nap. I long for nothing else. \n\nSo many people talk about the amazing positives of motherhood but there are non. There are for fathers. They get to keep living their lives but also have a toy baby to play with when they wish. Motherhood on the other hand is only darkness, sleeplessness, having no time to even think for weeks on end. It's a child hanging on your breast screaming all day and night, it's running around chasing a toddler so they don't die. It's having forgotten the faces of your friends and family and even your own because it's unrecognisable.\n\nThere are so many things I will not be able to do again for decades. Go out alone, go on vacation, have a shower in peace, sleep well. At this point I've given up hope that I'll ever get anything out of this. I don't love my children. I don't know why but I don't. I hate my husband for being their parent and I hate all mothers in the world who say they are happy. What the hell about this makes them happy? Not having the energy to eat? Are they on drugs or something? \n\nMy life has become unbearable. Everything I believed about parenthood was a lie, in this journey there's only sorrow and no way out. I will have to play the happy loving mother for the rest of my miserable life.",

    "postText": "I woke up around 9:30 this morning and she was snuggled up against me with her school Chromebook (camera off), doing her live lesson and even scribbling down notes.\n\nShowered, teeth brushed, and a warm bowl of oatmeal on the table next to my bed. She also knocked out over half of her assignments while I was peacefully snoring away.\n\nHonestly, I'm fucking speechless. I've always had issues sleeping properly (due to anxiety, if I had to guess). Instead of taking my being tired/irritable personally, she grabbed it and ran in the opposite direction.\n\nThe most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for me came from an 8 year old.\n\nEdit: I don't know what these awards do specifically, but they did make feel even more fuzzy which is what counts \u2764 Thanks guys. Please give me more cute stories. Even if I'm slow to respond, I really enjoy reading them.",

It was the middle of the month though so this didn't make sense.  Going on line I found she had actually run her account dry when the money I put in there usually lasted all month so, I called her over and asked her what was going on.  She explained that the mom of one of her friends was on the schools free lunch program.  While this was bare minimum to start with it also did not cover anything but the basics, especially when it came to snacks and such so her friend was having to miss out and was not able to keep her company when they had snack times.  (No sitting with and distracting the kids having snacks if you did not have snack.)  So, my daughter was buying snacks, drinks and even better quality lunches for two.  I praised her for doing a good job and taking care of her friend, went in and, since we had gotten to a good place in life, just doubled what I had been putting in her account.  \n\n(For those who might be curious girls mom is a single mom with 3 kids.  I kept the double funds in there for about four months until she got a new job that pays enough that they no longer qualify for the free/reduced lunch program.  I still keep some extra in the account at all times now \"just in case\".)",

I said that\u2019s so thoughtful but I\u2019d be lonely without you. She said you won\u2019t be lonely you have the kitten, the big cat and the dog to keep you company. She was adamant she could make this work for me. I just told her that if I have a day off she gets the day off too because I know daycare days are long and tiring for her but she still thinks I need a day off. She also keeps coming up with ideas like getting a robot vacuum so I wouldn\u2019t have to clean the floors or how she\u2019s going to clean the house so I don\u2019t have to. It gets me right in the heart that she\u2019s worrying about me like that but also so thankful to be raising such a sweet and caring kid. She\u2019s my little mate, such good company while her dad is away and we take care of each other \ud83d\udc97",

When they got back home at who knows what time, she would pay the sitter and then go to bed whilst her friends passed out in our living room (should stress her friends are like family, really nice people). In the morning I was always first up and would quietly make toast out orange juice in a pitcher and make a big jug of coffee for everyone ready for when they woke up. My mums friends still to this day say how much they appreciated it. Also used to make breakfast and coffee for my mum every morning when I was a kid anyway because she worked so hard looking after me :)",

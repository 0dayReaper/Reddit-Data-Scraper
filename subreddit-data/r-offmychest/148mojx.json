And I do, I want to move on. Next year I am going to university, I really need a fresh start. A new life. Right now I am living with my mother and my step father. I hate it there. I miss my dad everyday. I wake up, and the thought of \"my dad commited suicide, he is dead\" pops up in my head. I feel so left by him. \nDeath of a loved one is really difficult. When he died, it felt like a part of me died. A part that was happy, hopeful and light-hearted. I can't communicate in the same \"small talk\"-way to friends. My heart feels so heavy. But I have to move on. \nBUT HOW?\nHOW DO I MOVE ON?\ncan somebody please help me, guide me. \nI feel lost and alone in the world.\nHelp me, please.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t know the answer to this. It sucks. Grief fucking sucks. A close friend of mine lost her 7 year old son in an accident and she will NEVER be the same. It is so hard to navigate. I often am afraid I\u2019ll say something wrong in her presence. I never understood the massive impact of grief until this happened. I think she would tell you that it will never end and never go away but the weight of it lessens with time. Time does not heal all wounds but it does get easier to function. I\u2019m sorry you are going through this. Suicide is a horrible thing for those left behind. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to blame the ones who couldn\u2019t go on anymore. They couldn\u2019t fight their demons any longer and who am I to judge that. Just try getting through each day and find joy where you can. I wish you the best and to find peace more often than not.",

(getting emotional writing this). \n\nPlease for the love of god, do not stop. \n\nIts a massive thing to ask for help so i am very proud of you for posting this. \n\nHope this helps. Stay strong, chin up. here if you want to talk.",

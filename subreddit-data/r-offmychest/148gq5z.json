    "postText": "M #1\u2013I did nothing to warrant your attitude. I was nice to you and for some reason, that irritated you and possessed you to take my friend group who weren\u2019t such great friends from the start. \n\nK #1, K#2 &amp; S\u2014you all wanted to be my friends first. Remember that. I don\u2019t know why y\u2019all started getting mad when I pushed back on how you treated me like I was your pet and then you turn around and act clingy as fuck because you know you won\u2019t find a better friend. You just can\u2019t accept that you can\u2019t manipulate me. \n\nM#2\u2013you didn\u2019t have to know me or be my friend but then you did and you wanted my energy to yourself but didn\u2019t have a problem ditching me for other people and then accuse ME of ditching you when I had a LIFE OUTSIDE OF YOU. \n\nM#3\u2013a lot of your internalized ableism will never not affect me, so thanks for the lifetime of having to heal when you couldn\u2019t do the healing yourself I fucking guess. \n\nGonna delete this later prob",

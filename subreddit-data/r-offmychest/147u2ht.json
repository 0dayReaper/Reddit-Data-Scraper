    "postText": "tw: ed!! \n\nI wanted to share this because I think this maybe beneficial for people who have struggled with body image issues.\n\nI (21f) was relatively fit for my age until post my parents divorce. I was around 4 but the issues of the divorce didn\u2019t start effecting me till I was older. Long stories short, I grew up with a lot of anxiety. Food was comforting, I kinda \u201cballooned\u201d when I moved back to south county to be closer to my dad. \n\nThis came with the obvious bullying- the anxious, chubby, unkempt girl who had yet to discover deodorant was probably what most people would describe me as. Around this time, I\u2019m in middle school. Obviously with all the bs I started developing an ED. \n\nFast forward to high school, I had never been upfront with my mom about my ED and the extent it took on me. I told her I wanted to loose weight, her innocently mentioned a diet she was on where she ate no sugar or wheat. She said how good it made her feel so she said that we would stop eating sugar and wheat together. Just so I wouldn\u2019t feel alone doing it. I was terrified of the gym, or doing sports, I thought I\u2019d be filmed then made fun of. So I never tried exercise or even considered it. (I know it\u2019s dumb but I had some traumatic gym class experiences lol.) \n\nI know my mom sounds like an almond mom rn, but truly she doesn\u2019t care how I look at all. It\u2019s never even been a factor, so I\u2019ve never felt pressure from her to be \u201cskinny.\u201d She would love me at 400lbs even and still say I was beautiful. (moms are great right?)\n\nThis diet obviously worsened my ed, I was hiding everything from her and my therapist. The only people who knew were my sister and my few close friends. What was horrible about the whole thing is, I never ended up loosing any weight. I was 5\u20195 around 200lbs at 16. \n\nWhen I graduated I gave up, I just started eating whatever. My weight maintained itself, so i just thought \u201cI\u2019ll be alone and ugly forever anyway so who cares.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I broke my tailbone and developed serious PFD, then starting pt, I realized I had knack for exercise. It took years of healing and missing 3 years of my college life, to finally start going to the gym, on walks, hikes. Then, I realized how much less pain when I ate healthier. So, I started eating healthier, exercising regularly, to help my pain but also to live a longer, healthier, happier, life. \n\nI stopped trying to loose weight. Have I lost weight? Yes. But I\u2019m content with the fact that my body will naturally rest at whatever weight is best for me. I refuse to be held hostage to a scale anymore, but being healthy is not the enemy. I feel beautiful because I\u2019m healthy, I don\u2019t nitpick what I eat. I eat till I feel full, then if I feel like running, I\u2019m doing it. If not- I won\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m not going to the gym so I can look a certain way, I\u2019m going because now I can walk up hills with my dog without getting out of breath. I can walk the city for hours with friends without needing them to wait up for me. That has nothing to do with my weight, but how active I am. Increasing my stamina. The minute I stopped trying to adhere to what everyone else\u2019s opinion, and my own opinions, I felt functional.\n\nDon\u2019t go to the gym to loose 15 lbs before that party, go to the gym so you\u2019ll have the stamina to dance all night :)",

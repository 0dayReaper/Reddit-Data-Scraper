    "postText": "\nI\u2019ve grown up around nature my whole life and I feel super close to the environment around me. I always feel the most at peace when I\u2019m alone in nature. For a long time I\u2019ve wanted to live in a remote area and just be truely myself. Once I finish university that is what I plan to do. Cities also stress me out a lot too.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is normal but I have always felt this way. When people ask me what my dream home would be, I always say a small home in the forest or on a mountainside with my future husband and children. \nIs this weird? Am I the only one that loves this idea? All my friends think it\u2019s weird.",

Sometimes I wake up early just to hear the birds chirping. Once I make enough money, I'd love to move to some countryside in the north.",

    "postText": "Both her (20m) parents died when she was at a young age. Car crash. She got adopted by new people that overtime became drug addicts, she survived with them. She has no siblings, when she was younger she had a boyfriend that fucked her up many times. He beat her till she had bruises and bleeding, and what made it worse, is he knew her situation before doing these things to her. She broke up with him a year ago cause she thought he was all she had.\n\nWhen you see her, you\u2019d never think these she\u2019s been through this. She beautiful inside and out but she underestimates that. When I met her at college, she was broken. Like literally broken. She couldn\u2019t even talk properly and she was a stutterer. She\u2019s getting better thankfully. But her mind frame was soo bad, she would apologise for everything. I became her friend overtime slowly, after she would call me everyday just to hear my voice. I was going through minor problems with coursework and would go crazy on the phone and she would cry of laughter. From two months ago, she became my girlfriend after confiding to me that she\u2019s in love with me. I\u2019m keeping this girl safe at all fucking costs.",

Yea I\u2019ve tried to persuade her but she isn\u2019t comfortable opening up, I\u2019m not going to push down on it hard and just let her do it on her own time. At the moment the only person that she can open up to is me. Maybe she\u2019ll warm up to it soon, maybe I\u2019ll go with her.",

Not saying that like you two \"need help\" because you're doing something wrong.\n\nBut it seems like she took a lot of mental damage along the way from some bad people. And now you're experiencing that damage second hand. That shit is tough, and therapy will give you tools to process that stuff more easily and better.\n\nThe other thing is every relationship has its ups and downs. That normal cycle, plus a lot of trauma can be tough. She might not always need you to be a protector. She might need you to be a listener, a fixer, emotional support person, homework helper,  or a doer of household chores ECT ECT. Therapy will help you see those needs and be better at providing them to her.",

That feeds the ego by providing a \u201cpurpose\u201d and sense of heroism. \n\nThere is time for that role but also in order for you both to grow to fullness, there will have to be many other dynamics! There is always room to be caring, loving, and able to protect, but it can\u2019t be the only dynamic or it won\u2019t be sustainable.\n\nNot saying any of this to frown on anything, only to share perspective to help this relationship continue growing! Best to you both",

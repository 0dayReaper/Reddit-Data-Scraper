    "postText": "\nOn March 29th I was the victim of a near fatal motorcycle crash in Bryan, Texas. It was a sharp bend, and a truck changed lanes only a couple feet in front of me, leaving me to decide if I\u2019d like to drive into the back of this truck at about 45 mph or hit the breaks (an equally scary idea if you know how cornering works on a motorcycle). I hit the breaks, and by some saving grace barely missed the back of this white ram truck as I started flying off the road. I ended up being taken to a local hospital, where I spent 6 days in the Trauma ICU and underwent an emergency surgery. My body had bounced like a balloon twice, rolled about 15 feet, and my bike had flipped thrice. All this in an effort to avoid colliding with the back of this truck due to the trucks unsafe lane change. I had a third degree laceration on my liver, holes in my small intestine, bruised lungs, and an arm triple it\u2019s regular size. \n\nWithin the first hour of arriving at the hospital Officer Crawford from Bryan PD shows up to ask me questions about the wreck, I give him a description of the vehicle. He writes me a ticket for not having a motorcycle license, while I\u2019m in a neck brace, 4 rounds of morphine deep, and clearly in awful condition. I guess Bryan PD were in such urgent need for the money they had to give a 17 year old kid on the brink of death a ticket right then and there. Mind you I don\u2019t have so much as a blemish on my record. \n\nThe officer \u201cinvestigates\u201d for the next couple weeks. He calls me and tells me they found the truck on traffic camera, but the camera isn\u2019t clear enough to read the plate. They tell me they can\u2019t do anything since I prevented the physical contact, and at other times tell me they\u2019re still working on finding the truck. Mind you I was named not at fault in the accident report. They were inconsistent and frankly didn\u2019t seem to care. They closed my case with no progress. I lost my bike due to how much it cost to get it out of the tow-yard by the time I was out of the hospital. KAGS wrote a story, \u201cMotorcycle crash victim given unexpected ticket by Bryan PD\u201c, but that didn\u2019t sway the police to try to bring me justice. Additionally, they never filed an investigative report so much as stating they had found a vehicle that matched the description on camera. Called if quits at the accident report.\n\nNow I\u2019m left with an unholy amount of hospital bills, trauma, and a ticket. It\u2019s infuriating how this played out. It\u2019s been dragging for months now. I was out of work for weeks, and have struggled so much since then. I\u2019m not sure what I can do anymore, I\u2019m just tired. They were quite close to having a vehicular manslaughter case, and nothing. I\u2019m sure if it was any of those officers kids they\u2019d be scouring the whole city. I\u2019m tired and will be for years to come as I keep getting updated on how my clinician bills are past due. I just needed to vent, as I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.",

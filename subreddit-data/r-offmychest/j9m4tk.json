I bet the condom will fly out of the package onto his knob quicker than he can say \u201caw hell no\u201d. At that point make him sign pg 2 of the contract that states he will NOT stealth you and if he does, he assumes all parental rights, etc.\n\nAlso, please be careful with these fuckers and put the condom on them yourself... and check that thing is still in place periodically.

Honestly it\u2019s such bullshit that people aren\u2019t taught this stuff in schools.\nI was a young adult male who didn\u2019t get laid much, and I found myself in the position where you try with a condom and then you flop, but you don\u2019t wanna miss out on your only opportunity of the goddamn year. You ask if the partner wants to proceed without a rubber, if they say no then you roll over or you do other stuff. Simple. Teach it in schools",

Then she put it on me with her mouth and that just blew my mind, jesus.  10/10 would wear condom again.",

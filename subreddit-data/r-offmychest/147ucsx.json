            "comment": "Definitely look up budgeting videos online, look for ones going through an example budget looking for costs to cut to pay debt off. Subscription services, hobbies, etc etc. It may take some practice and you might betray the budget in the beginning, but continue to do your best and don't give up on it because sticking to a budget can take practice when you're not used to it. \n\n\"The Budget Mom\" has many videos on youtube going through viewers budgets and giving advice for how to scrounge up money, and \"Debt Free Millenials\" has good advice too, both also have beginner videos to setting up budgets.\n\nIf groceries are a sizeable contributor to your spending, also look up videos of people making a week of meals under $20. They're wild. \"Julia Pacheco\" on youtube is someone I enjoy watching, she's pretty creative with her budget meals.\n\n8k is a lot, I'm sorry it's become such a constant stressor for you. But keep chipping away at it with every penny you scrounge up, and it'll become more manageable over time. You got this!",

Minimizing other\u2019s struggles just because you had it worse doesn\u2019t help most people. You\u2019re allowed to be scared of your skin cancer even if other folks have worse cancers. You\u2019re allowed to find 8k insurmountable  even if other folks have had debts of ten, a hundred, a thousand times that.\n\nMaybe you find it helpful to have your own issues diminished. Most folks don\u2019t.",

Which included the whole family and even his own brothers called out of work but his reasoning( that he a new tattoo and he had to let it heal because the tattoo took 7 hours. Ive gotten tattoos and i still manage to do things after.\n\n\n2.he came to my graduation but on the weekend , my wife threw a graduation party and he didn\u2019t show up to the graduation party because he had a event for his step daughter. I asked him you couldn\u2019t have come for a couple of hours then goto your event. He replies\u201d oh that the event was planned\u201d \n\n\nMind you my stepdad came to both with no hesitation.",

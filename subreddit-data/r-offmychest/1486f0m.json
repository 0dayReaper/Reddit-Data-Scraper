    "postText": "For context, I am going to see my favorite band in concert this Friday and I\u2019m very excited about it. The only issue is that months ago when I bought the tickets, I impulsively bought vip tickets because of how excited I was. The vip tickets include a meet and greet and photo with the band, and this didn\u2019t really bother me much until quite recently. \n\nTonight I was trying on the outfit I\u2019d been planning to wear to the concert for a while, and to my disappointment I look terrible in it. I spent so much money on this whole ensemble just to end up hating how I look in it. My dissatisfaction for my outfit then turned into dissatisfaction with my overall appearance, and this is nothing new to me. Ive struggled with severe skin issues  since I was a baby, and lately my skin has been a bit irritated and inflamed. Throughout my life people have asked me what was wrong with me, if I\u2019d been a burn victim, etc. I\u2019m just so afraid that they\u2019ll think these things about me, and of course I\u2019ll have no idea if they will. It still sucks nonetheless. \n\nI hate that they\u2019re going to see me like this. They\u2019re going to perceive me like this. I don\u2019t even feel like I deserve to wear an outfit that looks even remotely cute anymore. And trust me, I know that I\u2019m overthinking all of this. These people will see me for a few seconds and then move on with the next people and forget I even existed, but just those few seconds of them realizing a person such as me exists in the world brings me a bit of fear. I am already afraid of strangers judging my looks, let alone strangers whom I look up to in some sort of way. \n\nI\u2019m mainly afraid of this all becoming a terrible experience due to all the pressure I\u2019m putting on myself. It happened at my graduation, my birthday, and now this. I\u2019m likely going to knit pick every little thing that \u201cwent wrong\u201d and end up crying at the end of the night. I\u2019m not even gonna allow myself to enjoy the experience, even though I desperately wish I could put these feelings and thoughts aside for one night so I can have a decent time.",

Honey, you need to find the part of you that you don\u2019t hate so much whether it\u2019s your eyebrows or your sense of humour and go from there. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re feeling this way but you have a choice to make and I think you should choose to kill it on Friday. I\u2019m excited for you. Make your outfit the only thing you worry about ok? Return the clothing you don\u2019t like so much and build from the pieces that work. A great outfit that I\u2019m comfortable in is a game changer for me. I believe that deep down people are good so just walk in there with your chin up high like you own the place. Heck knows you paid enough money you gotta own something ha ha. They will see your confidence, even if you\u2019re scared inside. I wish you so much luck. You ARE going to have a great time if you choose to. \n\nDisclaimer: There\u2019s always a chance the artist you\u2019re going to see will act like an entitled asshole and that has absolutely nothing to do with you or the way you look.",

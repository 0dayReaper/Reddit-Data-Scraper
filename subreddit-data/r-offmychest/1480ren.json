I stopped looking after awhile bc it confused me. I unfollowed him on Insta right away, but he still, to this day, follows me &amp; looks at all of my stories- most of the time right when or very soon after I post them, even still. He randomly added me again on Snapchat many months after but never actually ended up saying anything. It\u2019s all confusing.",

My guess is he isn\u2019t emotionally stable or available to be with someone like you. \n\nI don\u2019t know you or know how you two were but there has to be a reason why he\u2019s holding on after he left. \n\nTo be honest, you deserve better. \n\nNo one else compares to him because no one should. Each person you encounter should be different and that\u2019s a good thing. \n\nFind yourself someone who has the things you liked about him plus the qualities you wished he\u2019d have. \n\nBut don\u2019t compare because that\u2019s not fair to whoever you meet.",

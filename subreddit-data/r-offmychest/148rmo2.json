    "postText": "*I hope I\u2019m not the only one singing \u201cBest Friends Brother\u201d from Victorious*\n*Names are fake for not wanting to be found out reasons*\n\nOkay, I\u2019m just gonna get into it. My (23F) best friend, Mandy(22F), and I have been friends for going on 7 years. She has a brother, Peter(20M). I\u2019ve always looked at him as nothing more than my goofy little brother (their family has literally absorbed me into their own. Both brothers say I\u2019m the favorite sister \ud83e\udd29). But for some reason lately, I\u2019ve been feeling little butterflies whenever I\u2019m around him. And honestly, I\u2019m terrified.\n\nHe\u2019s been going to the gym a lot lately, so he\u2019s asked me on several occasions how I think he looks. I mean just today, he came home from the gym, started flexing and looked at me and said \u201cmy arms look big, don\u2019t they?\u201d \ud83d\ude44 Then he started tell me about how his forearm veins pop when he\u2019s working out. He also started making fun of me for not seeing the new Spider-Man. I jokingly asked him to pay for it if he wants us to see it so bad, then he gave us money for tickets. That\u2019s just today. \n\nHe\u2019s always been sweet and funny and slightly arrogant/egotistical, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve grown to appreciate about him. We\u2019ve always had great conversations whether it be deep and thought provoking, or just silly jokes and making fun of each other (it doesn\u2019t help that he talks right at me, eye contact and all. I\u2019ll never get used to people actually being interested in what I have to say). I really do care about him. \n\nBut I\u2019m so scared of ever doing/saying anything about it. I can\u2019t tell Mandy because I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll ruin our friendship and I don\u2019t know if this is anything to even elaborate on. I don\u2019t want to talk to Peter about it for basically the same reasons, as well as the fact that he\u2019s moving in August. I\u2019m also like 99% sure he doesn\u2019t/would never feel the same way about me. But I think the thing I\u2019m the most scared about is losing that family. They are my happy place. They\u2019re the people I go to when I\u2019m sad. I asked their stepdad to go car shopping with me before my own dad. Their mom pampers me and treats me like her own. Their aunt is basically my other best friend. I have a key to their house. I can\u2019t lose them. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d survive, tbh. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel that pain in my chest.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this was all over the place. I\u2019m not doing too well mentally, my brain in jumbles and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m 1 minor inconvenience away from crying for 2 days straight \ud83d\ude02 Thank you to any of you that read and thank you for letting me vent. I\u2019ve never uttered this to anyone and I do feel slightly better now, having aired it out.",

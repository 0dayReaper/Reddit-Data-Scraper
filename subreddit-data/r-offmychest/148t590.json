    "postText": "Okay posting this might get me into hot water because I\u2019m unsure if he uses Reddit or not, so I\u2019m on a throwaway. I guess things started when I was 15 turning 16. I was in what some would call the \u201choneymoon phase\u201d of an incredibly emotionally taxing and toxic online relationship. My online then-boyfriend, we\u2019ll call him Jackson, hadn\u2019t yet established himself as a narcissistic paranoid schizophrenic, so I was in no way going to leave yet. (I left him after about 9 months, but we\u2019ll get to that.) The other guy, the one I\u2019m talking about, we\u2019ll call Connor. Connor, from the beginning, was funny, kind, sweet, trusting, and would always listen and hear me out. He\u2019s still to this day all of those positive things. Connor and I would always talk and hang out during practice for theater (our school was running a production of a very well-known stage musical) and sometimes he would drive me home from school. During my relationship with Jackson, Connor would fake-flirt with me, slip small innuendos, touch me any way he could, the whole nine yards. We even got locked in a locker together at some point, and nearly kissed. I didn\u2019t go through with it because I was staying faithful to Jackson, but thinking back I really should\u2019ve kissed Connor. I found at that during that time, Jackson had been cheating on me. I cried to Connor about it, and the entire time, he was supportive of me. He begged me to leave Jackson, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to. My relationship with Jackson finally ended a few months after that. To save my anonymity, I\u2019m not going to explain how things ended, just know it was really fucked up and nothing like anyone I talked to about it had experienced before. It ended the day before school started, so I blocked it out so I could do well this school year. I caught up with Connor, and he was happy I finally left that horrible relationship. We talked more and got closer. I knew I had a bit of a crush, but didn\u2019t know I was in love with him until a month or so after the breakup. I guess you could say Connor was leading me on when he was doing all the sly sexual stuff, because when I finally got the balls to ask him out, he was confused and said he just wanted to stay friends.  The mixed signals continued to get worse from there. During our school\u2019s play that fall, he confided in me that he had fucked a friend of his who had a boyfriend. He claimed he didn\u2019t know she was dating someone, but it just put a horrible taste in my mouth. That should have completely turned me off to him, but it didn\u2019t. Later that week during one of our shows, we were flirting for fun and one thing led to another and he kissed me backstage behind one of the curtains. I shouldn\u2019t have let it happen, but that\u2019s exactly what I wanted. It was so wrong but felt so right and I just melted. Shortly after\u2014I would say a few weeks\u2014we fell into a bit of a FWB/situationship kind of thing. It didn\u2019t feel like a relationship: he practically ignored me, we never fucked or for that matter saw each other, all that happened was a few dirty phone calls and explicit photos (from my end only). I felt unfulfilled, so I ended it. We started talking and flirting again during our school\u2019s production of a famous musical-turned-movie, and during one of the practices, things got really touchy. I sat on his lap at one point backstage and (I\u2019ll spare you the details of most of it) he ended up grabbing my ass and sliding his hand up my shirt. One thing led to another and we ended up making out backstage, and the thrill of knowing we could\u2019ve gotten caught made things so much hotter. A few days after, he told me he was hanging out with another girl on the day off when I was going to be at the school taking a placement test. Something sort of snapped inside me, and I got so upset I didn\u2019t know what to do. When that happens, I usually just go silent, and that\u2019s exactly what I did. I went dead silent, walked into the very room we had made out in just a few days before, and full force decked a wall; I punched the brick wall twice, ripped the living shit out of my hand. He heard the pounding and came in, asked me if I was okay, but I couldn\u2019t talk to him. I couldn\u2019t even look at him. I stormed off and ignored him for a few days. Fast forward to prom, he\u2019s taking her to both his and her prom (she goes to a different high school.) He told me she has a girlfriend and that he third-wheeled. I was beyond livid, but hid it from him. I told him this really isn\u2019t the best for him emotionally, trying to treat her like his girlfriend when she\u2019s taken. He keeps going with the coveting bullshit. I ignored it all for the most part, but it hurts me how much he wants her and how little he wants me. She\u2019s not right for him, I know I seem vain saying that but it\u2019s true. In the long run, I\u2019m the one his family would like more. I\u2019m better wife material. I know that I would be worth his time. I don\u2019t care about his past, about his baggage. I would be willing to set the world aside to listen to him. I want to fix him and I know that sounds stupid but I really do. I want to heal from Jackson with him, and I want him to heal with me. We\u2019ve both been through a lot, and I am more than willing to work things out for him. I feel like something is wrong with me for wanting to be with someone who hurt me so badly emotionally, but I suppose I\u2019m just a glutton for pain. Connor and I have gotten back on flirting terms, and we spent most of today talking. I have another couple of guys I want to be with right now, but I just can\u2019t help being stuck to this boy. Connor is just so fucking attractive I can\u2019t handle myself around him. I swear, every time I talk to him my heart skips a fucking beat. I love him and I want him in my life, but I\u2019m hurt. I\u2019m hurting so badly over all the shit he\u2019s done, leading me on so many times and making me think I was the one. He makes me feel so special, but he\u2019s done that to so many other girls. He does this to everyone, and I\u2019m no different. I fucking hate it. I hate being his \u201cmidnight love,\u201d so to speak, the one he goes to when he\u2019s all \u201chot and bothered\u201d but she isn\u2019t responding. I can\u2019t be his second best anymore. I want to be his only. Why do I keep coming back to this man who so clearly isn\u2019t good for me? I\u2019m so desperately in love with him, I want to give him everything, I want him with every single fiber of my being. I\u2019m so in love, and the hard part is he\u2019s never gonna want me. He only wants her.",

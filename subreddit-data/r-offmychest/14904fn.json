    "postText": "Well, it has been almost 2 years I've broken up with my ex.  I tried keeping a good relationship with him because I truly loved him although I didn't have the intention of getting back together. I'm friends with all my exes, but the last one was the only one I couldn't get over and I have the feeling it's gonna take years, IF it happens.\n\nI met a boy last year and we're in a relationship for 5 months now. But I still think about my ex weekly. And I love my boyfriend, and even if my ex magically appears again in my life I'd never leave my bf for him again. I still love him, but not romantically. It's more of a friend love and caring. I know we would never work, that's why I broke up with him. In the other hand, I'm with my bf because I love him and I actually can see myself with him for a long time.\n\nMy boyfriend and I talk openly about our exes, and his last relationship hit him pretty hard. I honestly think he has feelings for her, but it doesn't bother me cause it doesnt make him love me less.\n\n I never told him what I'm saying here. I know it would make him upset and I'm not hurting his feelings. I'm not sure if what I'm feeling it's normal and it happens to a lot of people? But that's what I feel. Is it right to get into a new relationship without getting the previous one?",

    "postText": "Everyone always talks about how breakups with their significant other is so hard\u2026 and I would agree but I also feel it is not talk about enough about \u201cbreaking up\u201d with your best friend. I think about her all the time, wondering how she is doing and missing the time we spent together. I still get pictures that come up on my phone of us having fun together and it just makes me sad. I wish things didn\u2019t end the way they did between us and it\u2019s made it hard to get close to someone like that again. She was my best friend for 7 years.",

    "postText": "i dont know why i do this. on the fucking ledge myself yet i keep telling my friends not to jump. im a fucking hypocrite to the maximum degree.\ni got very important tests coming up, told my friends on discord ill likely be busy/unavailable till they finish and ive just... uninstalled the app from my phone bcuz ik its one of my biggest time wasters. still i cant help but pop in every now and then using the mobile browser because im fucking stupid and addicted and cant quit cold turkey.\ni see one of my friends posting depressing shit on his status since last night. i want to help. i want to tell him that everything's okay. i wanna tell him that im there for him like i always fucking do. i want to tell him that im here to listen that ill do anything to help anything i can. shit ive said a million times to many people. but i literally do not have the energy to deal with it anymore, there is nothing i can do to help him. im still. i dont know man. i feel like a terrible person no matter what i chose. i have no right to tell anyone anything because right now in the most earnest way i can say my plan for if i fucking fail these tests is to go up the roof and jump. what right do i have to tell him to not? even if i tell him i love him (platonic) what does it matter if i cant give him my time? even if i tell him im here to listen if he needs a shoulder to cry on what good does it do if I can't respond or be there for him consistently?\ni picked silence, for now. my account status is always on invisible/offline. no one knows when im online or not if im not directly texting you. like a coward. like a bystander doing nothing, turning the other way. i feel disgusted with myself for hoping someone else, some other friend or loved one of his sees, notices, does something, says SOMETHING- because i cant. i really, truely can't. not right now. my mental health is in actual shambles and ive gone up to the roof of our building at least once a day.\nthe only reason i havent committed is because of friends like them. i need to be here, on this miserable fucking planet, because some people i care about are suffering worse than me and i cant take the cowards way out after telling them so many times to not do it. we're all drowning together in the same sea and i just hope. i just hope they make it to shore even if i dont.\ni hope you make it to shore, n. i really, honestly, genuinely do. im sorry for taking the cowards route and not saying this to you. im sorry im not in a good enough headspace to help you. im sorry, im sorry. i truely am, sorry. please take care, please be well. im always thinking of you, of all my friends. you're the closest things to my heart even when we live miles apart.\ni just needed to scream into the void. ill go back to doing maths n exam prep and just idk ig deal with the creeping dread that permiates every cell of my body.\ngod i wish i didn't care about people, or at least i wish they didn't care about me... it'd make my decision a lot easier.",

I know it can feel like this fucking world has nothing to offer you but pain and misery, but there are those out there who find pleasure in knowing that you may sen that text, or call them, saying \u201chey man. Shit is alright. We\u2019ll be ok\u201d. I know what its like being that guy that cares for his friends, their shoulder to cry on, their audience for all their troubles but feeling like no one is yours in return.  Often times because we are that \u201cstrong\u201d friend, we put up tougher outside image and it looks like we have everything all figured out, and people think that sometimes of us.  But we have to be vulnerable with them too. Let them know we are just like them. We cry. We break. We fold. We doubt. We regret. We are no super human. I hope you reach out to your friend and open up. Maybe it will make something stronger between you two to come out of this with and know you have each other to lean on when shit hits the fan. One love. Good luck on your exams",

    "postText": "Before anything, I typed this rant a few days ago in a different mindset, but I still want to get it off my chest though in its original form. So:\n\nIdk where to start, long story short 2 girl got jealous and I got in a physical fight with one and ger sister. Basically the girl (A) I dated last year, she was a friend before. Said I love yous a billion times, I got sick for few months, fought over and over again and ended things with me. Made me feel like I'm nothing then ghosted. Then came back and became physical out of nowhere. Some really nasty shit happened that I don't even want to talk about. Then left for another city. Hurled insults and then ghosted for months. In between met another girl (B), she liked me, was a neighbour where I lived on my own, chased me, I made it very clear her I'm not looking for any relationships, she was fine with it, hooked up. Wanted to spend more &amp; more time with me. I lived alone so I was fine with it. Her sister (C) too started spending more and more time with me, and started liking me too (btw C has explosive anger issues, C &amp; B used to get into physical fights with basically C hitting her). B noticed. C kissed, I told B. Drama. Then things died down, still B kept hooking up. C kept making out. didn't hide anything from B, were just friends though. Anyway A reached out from nowhere, wanted to see me (a park). I was curious as what was going on with her (she had ghosted) so I agreed. Stupid me told B, for 2 days she butchered me to go along with her, told her no repeatedly, then agreed finally, on the way I told her it was bad idea (I got the feeling there would be drama). We arrived the place, already 1 hr late cause of all drama, she was really upset, tantrum, she didn't want to go inside, she'd wait outside (the whole time wtf), A repeatedly calling me,I tried reasoning with her for 5 minutes, then gave her entry fee money (she didn't have any) and told her come inside we're waiting, she didn't. A wanted to get back with me, all the locey dovey things, told me she was jealous, even offered to hook up (wow wtf is wrong with her). Got free, called her, blocked, called her sister, angry, B basically told her I took her forcibly (wtf, I didn't want to take her along in the first place) and that I deserted her there. Got to their room, physical fight starts (wtf) I leave, am in my own room. B comes basically saying C hit her, because of me (wtf). C comes, saying she wants to talk to me, I didn't let her, but she told me she just wanted to talk so I let in, she talks then gets angry, starts hitting me repeatedly, I'm like wtf, I hit her back, B comes along, starts fighting too, I hit her back too. Well it happened what was going to happen. Gathered entire building. Leverage she would sue, and she's a girl so nobody would listen to a guy, to everyone. Building owner didn't want any history inside the building. I agreed to leave. But fuck. Everything is fucked. Why it got so messy. C knew B like me, she would go out of her way to spend time with me alone, still she'd get angry at her own sister and fight with her, hit her, just cause she's upset and she like me too. B knew C liked me even before I told her everything, still she complied with C demanding alone time with me, I got company and wasn't alone so I didn't really care. B didn't want to tell C or anyone. B knew about A and her history. B knew how important it was for me to get a closure. With my time spent with A, I realised, she didn't care about me, she didn't even remember most of stuff, she just wanted me cause she couldn't have me anymore. B lied to C just to make her seem good in the story. And they all act like they aren't even fucking adults, capable of making their own decisions, act like children and how dare I not treat them like children, I mean somebody could've stolen her in a fucking public place, where she demanded to be deserted, had a choice at any time to come inside. And how tf C expects a physical fight to end. Just because she's a girl and she has an upper hand in law doesn't mean she gets to hit anybody she wants. Fuck them. Fuck everybody.",

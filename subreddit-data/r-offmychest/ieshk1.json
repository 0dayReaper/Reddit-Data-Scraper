Quit your job, move out into the woods, take care of your own health and be a hermit. You don't get to have all the advantages of belonging to a society but refuse to help that society when times are tough. That makes you a selfish wanker, not someone \"fighting for your freedom\".",

I did what I was supposed to do and quarantined as soon as I felt unwell. I wore masks and gloves consistently at my job. And yet my family was supposed to quarantine as well when I tested positive BUT INSTEAD they still went out without facemasks and went back to work/their normal lives. Then they had the audacity to harass me via text message and \u201cfamily meetings\u201d to tell me to get the hell out of their house because \u201cits your fault you brought covid-19 back to this house, thanks.\u201d \n\nI trust no one. The lack of caring and the level of persecution I received from \u201cloved ones\u201d when I got sick by mistake, (not from hanging out at freaking covid-19 parties), is heartbreaking. I will never forget what they and my friends who blamed me did to my mental health. I became suicidal because I felt so horrible for contracting this disease.\n\nEmpathy is in short supply right now. Wear the fucking mask, wash your fucking hands, quarantine when you\u2019re supposed to, and be kind to those unfortunate enough to get sick.\n\nPce",

I sunk into a world where I could trust no one and everyone was evil. I missed a lot of school one year because my mom had to make sure I didn't harm myself.\n\nOne day I got a bunch of letters from the theater class showing support and it made me so happy that these people were so kind. I ended up going back to school and made it my mission in life to find people who care. I've found there are a lot more empathetic people than you'd think.\n\nI live in LA where you'd think everyone is terrible because terrible people like it here, but the energy you put out into the world will be returned. If you're down and depressed you'll attract the wrong kind of people. If you're helpful and thoughtful you'll meet the kind of people you're looking for. It's easy to say \"well people are complicated and can be both good and bad.\" But when you do that you're on default mode and the default mode in mostly everyone swings low. Try to be the kind of person you want to meet and you'll see the world differently.\n\nIt may take time and work on yourself because it isn't easy to discipline yourself in that way and fight against the instincts you're used to, but anyone can do it. I've been through multiple traumatic experiences and I've blamed others for them, but in the end its all up to me to shape my world. If everyone thinks this way we'll be in a much better place.",

I think the hardest thing is that my family has always had the cycle of abuse alive and well. My poor mom (she supported me thank god) was just diagnosed with PTSD from living with our family. It\u2019s a super weird time because her doctor said that my sister (also supportive, bless her heart) and I most likely also suffer from PTSD. My grandma has choked me multiple times in the past, threatened to kick me out at my most vulnerable, sent what our family dubs \u201ccrazy letters\u201d full of abusive things, accusations, manipulation, and gaslighting. So this whole covid-19 abandonment thing isn\u2019t actually so much a shock to me at this point, it\u2019s just that you never really get USED to the shock, ya know? \n\nI know that there are a lot of good people. It\u2019s just exhausting after trying for years to be such a good kid, AND HONESTLY I was (my grandma likes to say otherwise but I know the truth, I was a good kid) and working so hard in school, only to be abandoned for something so left field. And I guess it\u2019s not the first time but it still sucks dick lolol.\n\nI find that I need to hide my diagnosis of covid-19 now. It no longer effects anyone negatively by doing so because I am completely recovered with legal documentation stating so, and I\u2019ve already informed the people closest to me such as roommates and close friends. It just honestly feels like you have leprosy. People don\u2019t want anything to do with you or to be around you even after you\u2019ve recovered so I just hide it now. And I understand people are very worried so I don\u2019t want to criticize the fact that people are just trying to be careful and safe... it\u2019s just that it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it still hurts, and the discrimination follows you well after recovery.\n\nThat\u2019s kinda why I said in my original post to be kind to people who are unfortunate enough to contract it because honestly the stigma follows you for so freaking long. It took moving cities, quitting my job, and telling almost no one in my new city what happened to me in order to somewhat leave it behind me.\n\nEveryone be kind, please! As a survivor, the judgement is the most harmful thing. I feel lucky saying that because I know that some people don\u2019t have that experience and they literally die from Covid-19 and so I feel very thankful I had a mild case, but it also left me feeling suicidal for getting sick. \n\nBe kind. Be kind. Be kind. You don\u2019t always know all the details, no one truly knows where they\u2019ve contracted it from, and you don\u2019t always know what is going on with someone. Ask them how they\u2019re doing emotionally and mentally - that is something that literally no one asked me the entire time I was sick/after recovery and instead everyone offered all the reasons why it was my fault. \n\nBe. Kind.",

I really don\u2019t see enough people right now to notice a stigma or maybe LA doesn\u2019t have as strong a stigma? I just think it\u2019s important to be aware even if you don\u2019t have it because even if you don\u2019t think you have it you might. Or it might be on your clothes.

I just know that they are out actively seeing other people and their parents are letting them see everyone, but because they know I was positive and recovered they don\u2019t want to see me specifically. And that\u2019s completely understandable and I support everyone wanting to be safe - it\u2019s just that they seem to ignore the fact that I have legal documentation that I am recovered. It just kinda sucks to be the person no one wants to see but they\u2019ll see everyone else lol but!!!! I understand and I don\u2019t blame anyone. I am also being ultra careful and not doing hangouts because my boyfriend who helped me move away never had it and people around me have never had it and it is STILL my responsibility to be safe and make sure to the best of my ability I do not pass it on to them.\n\nWell said and great comment, thank you for the support!! I wish you well with your own friends and family, I know it is hard. Idk about America but in Canada where I live we\u2019ve been burning each other at the stake for even being sick because so few people are sick right now here (relatively, I\u2019m not gunna say no one is but it\u2019s just kinda rare still so people are effing scared.) \n\nI wish you health and safety!

I was in such a dark place and everyone around me (grandparents, uncle, uncle\u2019s wife) were so toxic and horrible. They literally said they were mad at me for contracting it and that it was my fault.\n\nMy grandma ended up apologizing to me the day before I left, but they were crocodile tears. She did the same thing when she choked me and I was moving out. It worked multiple times back then but it doesn\u2019t work now - I\u2019ve learned my lesson. Immediately following my moveout she phoned my mom and blamed me again for \u201cgiving her Covid-19\u201d, despite her not getting sick the entire time because I was careful, and despite her never going to get tested and going back into society immediately after my positive diagnosis like nothing happened and like she wasn\u2019t putting everyone at risk.\n\nShit is so fucked up, even writing it out makes me so mad. I\u2019m so much happier now that I have an entire city between us. To clarify, my mom, sister, and dad have been totally supportive and have taken the right precautions this entire time by quarantining, wearing masks and getting tested. It was everyone else we lived with (we have a huge house of 8 people and my dad doesn\u2019t live with us) that didn\u2019t give two shits about doing the right thing. \n\nI signed a 12 month lease for the first time in my life - I ain\u2019t going back to that place ever again.",

People have made it extremely hard to do the right thing, I\u2019m telling ya right now.\n\nEven after everything that happened I still notified my upcoming roommates in university of my situation and gave them the option to opt out from living with me. It\u2019s just straight up the responsible thing to do. However I will say this: the general population needs to really get their blame game in check because there ARE going to be people who do not get tested and therefore spread it around because of the pure amount of shame associated with this disease. \n\nFinally for the first time in my city I saw them run a news story about how people need to be kinder to people diagnosed with covid, or else people are going to be too afraid to be honest and get tested and I 1000% back that up. OR DIE because of the mental health issues associated with being excommunicated by their own society. \n\nCurrently if I began having symptoms right now, I don\u2019t know if I could mentally handle going through that pain again. I would still get tested, and I would quarantine again, but honestly don\u2019t know how I would handle it mentally. I would have to keep it a secret. It was so fucking horrible. You have a unique opportunity to talk to people about medical issues - I hope that people get you as a nurse because of how supportive and caring you are. I hope you let them know that it is nothing to be ashamed of, but also to not shame others. I\u2019ve considered contacting my local news station and asking to run an anonymous story with my face in shadows about my experience. I\u2019m still thinking about it, as I believe it would help a lot of survivors. When I first recovered, I googled support groups and shame related articles and I found literally 1 article and that was it. There\u2019s not enough out there to support people going through what I have, and there\u2019s certainly not enough empathy from the public.\n\nDamn.\n\nBut thank you for the supportive comment. It means a lot to me in this time. &lt;3",

The average person doesn't deserve this, but the people running the show sure as hell do. As the saying somewhat goes, a society is measured by how it treats its most vulnerable, this is just ours showing how shitty it really is.\n\n(edit) misread, thought the person had said it, not the company. not surprised though. fuck Walmart",

I definitely agree that our society is treating us who are vulnerable like utter shit.\n\nIf they cared about people scamming the system, they'd start up top where the fraud's both more rampant, and immeasurably larger (they won't). It's more about squeezing water from a rock (or you, in this case) so there's more for the massive sponges running the place.\n\nI don't want to just bring about bitterness though, sorry- I dunno how I could help, but from my experience it's generally more a matter of getting the right people to advocate for you and/or people who _really_ know the system. The average person with their own life is at a disadvantage, with things like this you need a social worker or someone else who's gone through the hoops, preferably several times with others. Even then it's an uphill fight, but it's completely unfair without.\n\nDepending on who/where, chances are whoever's dealing with your case- on the govt. payroll for that matter- isn't on your side to say the least.\n\nI'd look around community centers/support groups, particularly those of categories you might fall into. For example, if you're a teen or young adult (or alternatively a senior, etc), if you're housing-insecure or food-insecure you're probably already accessing adjacent services too; if you're a student, or you're of a minority racial, religious, LGBT community, if you're an immigrant/refugee, or whichever community is based around a disability if you have one.\n\nYou'd be surprised how well someone who actually knows their stuff can get things going.",

Would have been worse had he not been wearing the extra heavy mask I made him of microfiber and polypropylene fabrics combined. Tests by researchers have shown multilayer, multifabric masks protect better than thin masks with one or two layers. 3-4 is best. \n\nThey also have found better quality masks reduce the viral load you get if exposed, which can affect how sick you get, so being cheap on reusable masks and not cleaning them is bad.\n\nsingle layer neck gaiters tested worst for protection. I bought one before the tests were put out and it was see through and sent it back. Useless, like using a chain link fence to stop mosquitoes.\n\nI work out of state, but I also wear a form fitted 4 layer fabric mask with polypropylene in it, in public to protect me, as I'm high risk.",

Usually people are very good in my area (UK) but me and my colleagues have started having people who come up to the cash register and REMOVE their mask for some reason thinking it's ok, and we're not allowed to say anything. It confuses me, because by doing that they're showing us that they don't care about our health or anyone else's. I've also started having people who don't wear it over their noses, and most complain they can't breathe in it which is why they're taking it off when they get to me. I've been wearing mine for so long now I'm used to it, if they just got used to wearing it they'd be fine. Not being able to breathe is not an excuse. I'm very much insulted by those who think I'm an exception to the rule we have in place, and I'm upset that I can't say anything to these people. They also don't socially distance from me when they do so, they lean over the till like it's any other day.\n\n\nWe're still in a pandemic people, stop pretending life is normal. Can't believe the lack of empathy people have for others' lives.

A friend of mine that I invited insisted that she is being safe and is quarantining herself for two weeks before the event to ensure that she\u2019s safe to attend. All other participants have actively been staying at home, wearing masks, practicing good hygiene, and not one of us are sick. Hell, I even have a thermometer to use at the door, we are handing out masks to those who wish to wear one, and shoes will be removed and hands will washed upon entry. So, back to this one friend. I have deleted Snapchat since I rarely use it, but my partner still has it. We stumble upon this girl\u2019s snaps and she is posting herself going to large coke parties and hanging out in stuffed rooms full of drunk and unmasked individuals.  I\u2019m feeling very hurt and let down because I trusted this person. Hell, her dad has health issues and she is still living at home. I can\u2019t believe she is exposing herself like this and living so recklessly. I plan on confronting her within the next week and telling her no, she is not coming to my place anytime soon, and I seriously doubt she\u2019s going to take it seriously. This virus has caused me to cut off so many friends and acquaintances, but I suppose that\u2019s a good thing. \ud83e\uddd0",

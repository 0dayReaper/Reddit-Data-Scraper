    "postText": "I just wanted to rant here and get this off of my chest. So me and a long time friend were chatting about an item that I am searching online since it\u2019s so popular and hyped now in our country it\u2019s either always sold out as in everywhere or the mark up price is so crazy. I shared this to her, and she told me that she didn\u2019t like the item because it\u2019s similar to a certain brand abroad. I responded that that brand is actually expensive here in PH then she said that it\u2019s quite affordable there. \nI did not reply to her anymore because I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s trying to imply, and since she\u2019s really a good friend of mine for so long, I\u2019d rather cool off a bit.  I just didn\u2019t like that she compared the item that I am raving about to a common brand abroad and made it seem that it\u2019s like not worth its hyped just because she gained access to them and she\u2019s now earning dollars. The thing is when she was here back in our country i doubt she can afford those items \ud83d\ude44",

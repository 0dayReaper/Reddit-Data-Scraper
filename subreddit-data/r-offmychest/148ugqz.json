    "postText": "5 years ago we met on tinder when I was 18 and she was 17. She told me she loved me when she was drunk on her 18th birthday, we told each other we loved each other sober just after. We did many things together over our 5 year relationship. \n\nWe created a friend group that orbited around us, she was impeccably charismatic. Whenever we had a problem we would communicate, we would be open with each other and we\u2019d solve any problem. At least I thought. We found out she was asexual and had endometriosis, making sex very difficult and to extents, impossible, while of course sex would be great, I loved her more than sex. \n\nOver the years, she\u2019d often get drunk and touchy with other people, many of our friends have seen her be promiscuous with them or others, but nothing crazy, brought for me to be uncomfortable and tell her to not get too drunk, which she disagreed with. \n\nLast year I learnt she cheated on me with one of her actor friends, they even went on a valentine day date. She was apologetic, but that\u2019s where the damage started. She continued to hang out with him until he sexually assaulted her. We stayed together for another year, until I heard she was considering getting in a relationship with one of our mutual friends. I confronted her and she said she was sorry again, and that I don\u2019t deserve her and we should break up. I said I wanted to work it out, but she needed to promise she wouldn\u2019t do something like this again, and she said no. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a mutual break up, she broke up with me. I love her, and I hate her. I gave so much, I tried so hard, I changed so much. She couldn\u2019t even be faithful as an asexual.",

He dumped me about 2 months ago, and the best thing for me was no contact. Because when he came back into my life - and they almost always do -(especially with the self martyr BS), it made it way more difficult/depressing than it needed to be. \n\nCut ties and move on - you deserve better than that. Trust me. It's so much easier said than done, but it will benefit you in the long run, trust me.",

Why would you possibly think that someone who can deliberately hurt you once, wouldn't do it again....?",

    "postText": "\nI am a girl, and I am a graphic design graduate able/available to work normal graphic design jobs but the work I've recently lost was my very second one... Although I've been clever ebougto finding solutions, ideas to suggest and such.... I've never been naturally good at math, but have always been excelled in more creative tasks. To say I am bad at math is an understatement and I feel insulted every time someone's pointing it out to me, especially when they once told me \"You should've known these since you were in primary school\", well look, truth is I don't remember how to count an entire signage's cm or mm as a scale 1:10, 1:1, 1:2 ect. I can't fucking do it. I just can't. I've tried and tried and get so disheartened because I can't. No matter how many years gone by, I still just can't do it. You know what I was supposed to find that made me start crying? This fucking scaling measurements I've mentioned before. Some peat work would tell about me that I am \"embarrassing myself\" because of not being able to do it. I am so fucking stupid. I tried to study, I tried getting help and I JUST COULD NOT GET IT. How the hell am I supposed to make this easier for me since I never was ablto even remember even the simplest results of measurements as cm or mm scales? I can't even do the simplest of measurements! Anyways, after all of these problems I have gotten wrong, this fucking problem was the tipping point. I always broke down during and after work over that. I just can't do it. What was even worse was once a colleague explained s what I did wrong, it made sense. And then I looked like a damn idiot. I am not ADHD, no I am not handicapped, none of it computes with me. It is simple as that. And I still feel I am fucking failure because I can't do simple math that even a god damn child could do or even a teenager who doesn't need to be asked how's 24X12 for example. \n\nEven though I've lost that job.... I still feel hatred towards myself.",

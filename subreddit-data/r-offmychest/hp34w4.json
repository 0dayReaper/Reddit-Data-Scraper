    "postText": "After losing my 12 year old today, who was involved in a drowning accident 3 weeks ago, I really can not stress this enough.\n\nShe was an amazing swimmer, in the pool. She had never swam in a river before. And that one decision to jump into the river off of a dock cost her her life. \n\nSo teach your kids the difference, and how to react if a current catches them so they don't panic. I don't ever want someone else to go through the nightmare that is currently going on in my life.\n\nEdit: holy hell you guys. I didn't expect this post to get this kind of response.\n\nI do know it seems like common sense right? The kids always had access to a pool and we never went to the river. It never even crossed my mind to cover that kind of thing because she wasnt exposed to swimming in open water.  What happened was.. she was at a friend's. And they decide to go to the river. She jumped off the dock and never came back up. By time they found her it had been close to 15 minutes.\n\nI made this post with the intent of reaching even just one person. I'd this made you think and reconsider how swimming is handled, then it did its job \n\nAnd I want to say Thank You! To absolutely everyone that reached out.. that sent their blessings and condolences, and the ones who awarded this post. You are all highly appreciated... even the snarky ones who left some assholish comments.",

You could easily break a leg or hit your head really hard (knock yourself out), and if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s under you, you can jump on another person and hurt them (communication) or get tangled up in moss/seaweed and fallen branches.\n\nAdditionally, if you are going to go into a river, check the weather reports so you don\u2019t go when it\u2019s raining, and if it rained recently you should check the nature people website (completely forget what it\u2019s called lol) to see when the water levels go down to a safe swimming level. A once lazy river *will* turn into a rushing death trap when it rains! \n\nI went with a group on a mattress float trip down a big river a few years ago and it had rained a few days prior. The guys who organized it thought it\u2019d be fine since it was a few days later, but when the 20-30 of us went out, it was calm for a while but we all got separated into clumps miles apart, and myself and a few others got pulled under the water under the roots of a tree and I absolutely would have died if another guy hadn\u2019t pulled me out.. and I was only trapped in the branches with water shooting in my face, drowning me. There were two people who were pulled completely under and we couldn\u2019t find them for two hours (murky water, can\u2019t see anything) and they showed up on the beach, luckily alive, just severely bruised and beaten up. But hell it scared me so much I\u2019ve never gotten in a river again, creeks only for me!\n\nIf anyone has more safety tips, please add them!",

There is a large rock base around and under the piers to support the structure and keep it from floating away (size depends on width of pier but like 10-20 ft around and relatively near the surface), and people die every year jumping off the pier and hitting their head on the rocks.",

His advice to us that actually saved his life is if a current takes you too far out and you try to swim against it you\u2019ll lose and eventually get tired and can drown. The best thing to do is literally just float. Eventually the current itself will push you right back to shore. \n\nAlso please please don\u2019t underestimate water currents. My cousin and I almost drowned once in not even 2 feet of water on the shore at the beach simply because a current caught us while we went under water and we couldn\u2019t get out of it. If it weren\u2019t for some locals who were patrolling the area because they knew the currents were strong that day we would have died. \n\nMy dad always says that we should have a respect for the open water and never be overconfident of our swimming abilities because that is when accidents happen, That day I learned he is absolutely right.",

Also, there\u2019s other aspects that can cause people to panic &amp; therefore create a dangerous situation that wouldn\u2019t happen as often in a pool - low visibility, seaweed, cold water, fear of fish, sudden drop offs, etc.\n\nI also believe OP was talking about strong currents, I\u2019ve never experience this but people panic when they\u2019re suddenly getting swept away and if they don\u2019t know exactly what to do. From what I\u2019ve read/been taught, it\u2019s important not to fight the current because you\u2019ll exhaust yourself - if you\u2019re ever caught in one, it\u2019s important to swim horizontally along the shore then try to go by diagonally once you\u2019re out of the current. Call for help so people know what\u2019s happening, and try to remain as calm as possible.\n\nI think to prepare yourself for open water swimming, don\u2019t just jump into water you aren\u2019t used to, especially not alone. Wear or carry a life jacket or other buoyant aid with you, stay close to the dock/boat/etc, definitely practice actual swimming/treading water where you can touch of the bottom before you try going deeper. Be prepared for the things I mentioned, cold water, drop offs, currents, etc.",

(Big male friend &amp; female friend) My dad was telling me to be careful because there were ocean currents going on so I said okay. I stood close to the shore the entire time and it was nice.\n\nThen my male friend picked me &amp; my other friend up (i'm a short female) and jokingly, forcefully took us deeper into the water. I was begging him to let me go because I'm not a good swimmer and I was warning him about ocean currents. He laughed it off and kept going deeper until he said \"oh I can't touch the floor anymore\" and he tried to turn around to go back. That's when it started. Huge waves were coming over us and sucking us into the ocean. He told us to grab onto him but I was slipping away. My female friend held onto his shoulders and I was holding onto her until she shrugged me off so she can float better. \n\npanic. \n\nI was drowning, going up for air, screaming for help, drowning, going up for air, screaming for help, repeat. Waves kept sucking me in and pushing me down. People in the shore became small.. no one could hear me yelling off the top of my lungs! \n\n(My main worry was my dad. I love him beyond words and I would've tore his whole life apart had I died that day. Not to mention he warned me. He would've thought that I didn't listen)\n\nI knew I had to swim horizontally to the shore and not fight the current like my dad said. I began doing so while still screaming and drowning on repeat. My friends made it to the shore and sent a girl to help me. (Looking back, that's a terrible idea because it could've endangered her) But I think I did a decent job getting close enough so that she could help me. \n\nThen she made it to me and grabbed my hand. I remember she had this worried look on her face. I was in so much shock that I was still screaming for help while she was taking me back. She swiftly took me to the shore and I thanked her so much. I told her she's so beautiful and I'm gonna marry her. (I was obviously joking but I wanted to express how much that meant to me) \n\nI remember while taking me back she was assuring me that we're okay, and she let me know that she could touch the floor, and she was an experienced swimmer. She saved my life. A whole angel was sent to me that day. \n\n\\~ Right after, those \"friends\" were laughing at how I was screaming for my life. They were imitating the way I yelled for help. I'm no longer associated with them, thank god.",

People die relatively often by getting caught in them because they don\u2019t know how to get out. The only thing you should do when experiencing a rip current is swim with the current (NEVER against it) and angle yourself outwards. You may get pushed out pretty far, but swimming against the current will tire you out quickly, and that\u2019s how people drown. [Here](https://scijinks.gov/rip-currents/) is the link.",

Big lakes (like the Great Lakes) and oceans, you should swim parallel to the shore to get out of a current. \n\nBut really even more than that; just be cautious. A lot of places will mark the strength of the current somewhere along the beach, and pay attention to that. We have a lot of drownings of tourists on red flag days when no one should be swimming, but they underestimate the strength of the waves. Also, I\u2019m a big proponent of staying closeish to shore. Its the people that go out 100 yards and then get caught in a current that really get in trouble fast. You can get caught in a current close to shore and still have problems, but those problems get exponentially worse the further out you are to begin with.",

Then a lot of water rushes through that opening, which can continue for a hours, as waves all along the shore keep replenishing the water to be ejected through that one spot.\n\nThat's why you want to swim parallel to the shore, until you're out of that current that keeps dragging you out. If it's a particularly strong current, just focus on keeping your head above water, conserving some energy, until the current weakens.\n\nI grew up near Lake Michigan, and people unfamiliar with the lake underestimate its danger because there are no major tides like in an ocean, but it still has rip currents that can drag you a mile off shore. Windy days with big waves really draw people unfamiliar with the lake, as it's fun to body surf and frolic in, but that's when the rip current risk is highest. It can happen in calmer water too though; an isolated big wave (meteotsunamis) or even wakes from a boat can cause ruptures in built up sand that result in rip currents that last for hours afterward.\n\nThere are also undertows during stronger waves, which pull water back toward near the bottom of the lake, while waves are pushing water forward near the surface. Those happen all along the shore, not in isolated spots, and can knock you off your feet, and can pull you away from shore under water...in that case you just need to get to the surface, and try to get to back to shore, floating near the surface to avoid it pulling you under again as you near the shore.",

People think the sandbars are safe because they\u2019re relatively shallow, but those can become dangerous very fast because of how the water builds around them. \n\nIt really comes down to respecting the power of these bodies of water, and being aware of what they can do. Every year in school, we had to watch this video called \u201cRespect the Power\u201d and it was all about the different currents/undertows etc, how to safely get out of them, how to identify conditions that could be unsafe,\nand just in general the dangers of swimming in open water too far out. And I think respecting the power of these lakes is what\u2019s important. You don\u2019t have to be an expert swimmer, you don\u2019t have to be able to identify every type of current, but you have to recognize that it is inherently more dangerous/difficult then swimming in a pool and plan for your skills accordingly.",

If you are swimming in a location that has a reef, swimming parallel could potentially be what causes you to drown. If you are getting pulled out, and are close to the reef, by swimming parallel you put yourself at risk of not making it out of the rip in time. Instead you try to exit the rift but end up outside the reef where you enter the risk of getting caught in a wave, having that wave slam you against the reef, get dragged down under by the current, and enter this circular motion of constantly being slammed and dragged across the reef. \n\nSometimes it can be best to just completely relax, let the the rip pull you out into open water, then just float and wait for somebody to come rescue you.",

As you know, when a wave rushes towards land, the water level technically rises in that spot, and then the water rushes back out.\n\nBut a beach is very large, and waves are not uniform across the whole shoreline. You may see spots where two waves near each other push water up the shore, and this water needs to go back out to sea somewhere. Sometimes this happens between the spot where those two waves meet. That spot in between is a riptide and causes the water to effectively suck quickly out to deep waters.\n\nWhat happens is a swimmer will be caught in this, freak out and try to swim against this current back to land, and then get tired and drown. The safest thing to do is float on your back or tread water calmly and then swim parallel to the shore until you get out of the riptide.\n\nNote: a current will never pull you under water. But waves could submerge you briefly, and if you\u2019re too tired, you may swallow water, panic, and then drown.",

Good for you.   \n    \nI think what they are trying to say is that the ocean is an extremely powerful and dynamic environment, and that swimming is one of the more difficult activities you can do (energy level wise), and when you combine those things together, you can get killed very quickly. You need to educate yourself and have a certain fitness level and approach to begin to be safe. But you can absolutely get there.\n    \nReading currents and rip tides and that sort of stuff is not easy. Some beaches are very stable in terms of how their waves and currents are from day to day, some change every day. The best thing you can do when you get to a spot to swim is to observe the waves and the flow of the water before you get in. If you're the least bit concerned, don't swim there.    \n   \nIt would be worthwhile to find someone who really knows the ocean and beaches in your area, like a surfer or someone who swims the beaches training for triathlons and things like that. Ask them to take you and show you what to look for.    \n   \nIf you want to be safe in the ocean, then keep practicing to be a better swimmer. Get your endurance up. Learn techniques on how to float on your back to save energy. Take an adult swiming class. Make sure someone always brings a boogie board or similar when you go, in case they need to swim out to help someone out. Rescuing a drowning person without a flotation device will likely get you both killed.    \n   \nIt might also be a good idea to swim out with someone who has two boogie boards, one for them and one to give to you when you need it. Get in some moderate waves where you're spending energy trying to tread water or float. See how long you can last. Get a good feel for what your ability level really is and how you react when you're getting tired. You might find you can only last a few minutes, because swimming is exhausting, and a few minutes goes fast. Feel that fear of being out too far and tired for the first time when someone is right there to help you. It will help set your caution level.   \n   \nThe point is to not be scared, it's to be informed and prepared and a realist. Because, honestly, the ocean doesn't give a fuck about you and your friends. But that's everywhere in nature. All of nature can be enjoyed, you just need to be smart about it, be educated, and not get complacent.    \n   \nAnd never hesitate to swim with a small float/ noodle/board, anything like that. Especially in a new place. Don't ever let anyone give you shit for that. You're out there to enjoy yourself and have fun, and that's one of the best ways to do it safely.",

Best lesson I learned is that if you do fall into a river with a strong current, try to stay calm (so important!) and try to float on your back, feet first. Almost all river currents will have eddys where the current will change, and you can swim to the side. It's near impossible to stay calm and keep floating downstream, but it's usually your best bet. I hope that helps.",

The danger isn\u2019t from the rip, it\u2019s from you panicking and fighting it until you\u2019re so exhausted you go under. Usually currents drag straight out from the beach so you need to swim parallel to the shore to cross it (obvs if there\u2019s lifeguards around wave to them like crazy). Don\u2019t freak out that you\u2019re far from shore, just focus on swimming across that rip and then you can begin to head in towards the beach again. \n\nIf you\u2019re really interested, Aus literally has an entire tv show (Bondi Rescue) which is 90% people who don\u2019t know how to swim getting rescued from beach currents, and there\u2019s lots of useful info about what to do in those situations.",

If you get caught by a river current then float on your back, feet first with your toes pointing upwards. Rocks would be something you need to look out for. Feet first gives you a chance to feel the rock before it scrapes into your back or head. Another thing you can do to prevent this is to have your arms under your back with your hands open, palms facing the direction you\u2019re going. That way you can push yourself up from rocks that would otherwise scrape you. Whats worse than getting scraped is getting your foot stuck somewhere. If a part of you gets stuck under or on a rock there\u2019s a chance the current could push your head under causing you to drown. Let yourself take a few scrapes if it means you avoided getting your foot caught. Always keep your head above the water. Your feet should always be lower than your head. With all of that in mind, just ride the current until you\u2019re out of the rapids or close enough to shore. Don\u2019t fight the current, chances are you won\u2019t win.",

We were suited up on the bank of the river and then told that we had to swim to our boats...on the other side of the river. 3 people in our group backed out; took the refund and refused to swim because of fear.\n\nI have always been a terrible swimmer. Even failed swimming classes in grade school, I'm that bad. And I'm pretty terrified of water. I grew up in a very northern state where nobody has swimming pools and the majority of swimming is done in the short summer months in lakes. \n\nSo, when the guides asked me if I was swimming or taking the refund, I was more compelled by the adventure awaiting me in that boat, and also by the fact that there were about 8 guides around that would pull me out if I got into trouble on my way to the boat.\n\nThose guides were amazing teachers and very smart for starting the trip that way. I totally lost my fear of water that day, and learned some tips on how to survive falling in a river...\n\nIf you fall into a river, roll into your back and point your toes down river. You can use your toes to steer a little. If you move your toes to the left, your body will scoot towards the left a bit, and the same with the right. You're basically turning your body into a floating device and your feet are the steering. Use the current, don't fight it.\n\nBeing on your back enables you to float and save energy. You want to do your best to relax and pay attention to to the banks on both sides. You need to look ahead of you because of how fast you're moving and look for a spot with the least amount of brush and trees on edge and a low bank, if there is one. You're looking for somewhere to aim where you can get out of the water that doesn't have a bank you'll have to climb because you will be exhausted. Also,chose whichever side you're closest to.\n\nSo, after you've found a spot downriver a bit that looks like a good point to exit, you do your best to use your toes and steer as close as you can to that spot. When you're close enough (yes, it's hard to judge and kind of hard to explain) you use all your stored energy, flip over onto your stomach, and swim with everything you've got and get to that spot you picked. As if your life depended on it (because it does).\n\nThe trick is to not panic, and do your best to save energy floating on your back, until you need to use it to swim to the bank.\n\nI hope I explained well enough and maybe this is useful info.\n\nThe crazy thing is that I learned this in my early twenties, but had spent most of my childhood years going back and forth in summers to a cabin my parents have on a river. We wore life jackets 100% of the time, but nobody ever taught myself or my siblings how to swim in a river.",

If you find yourself in a river off a raft it's a fairly simple to get back on as the person on your opposite side assists you.

One of the chaperones was also a lifeguard, and he\u2019d make us sit on the beach for a good 10-15 minutes first to examine the current and conditions of the water. He said never let your guard down, even with the ocean being flat. \n\nAt the beginning of the year before anyone would be allowed to run into the water, he took us to a lagoon that has an opening with a semi strong current and taught us how to swim against it. It\u2019s HARD, BUT the main thing to try to do is stay calm so you don\u2019t overexert yourself, and to go under the surface of the water and swim back. However with riptides and undertows, really all you can try to do is stay calm and hope the current doesn\u2019t push you too far out.",

Every year people drown in a river near my home. It doesn't matter if you \"know it well\", most people who died swam in that river every year since they were born and yet. Currents can change in a matter of seconds and there's very little you can actually do depending on the river.",

Second: If you don't know the river WEAR YOUR LIFE VEST. Someone dies every year, but it's mostly drunk adults who take their vests off. I am always so sorry to hear about the kids. My heart goes out to you OP.\n\nIf you do find yourself in the current DO NOT try to fight the current. You'll only tire yourself out and get nowhere. Other advice given earlier up the thread is good. Feet first, float on your back. I can go headfirst, but I'm 4th generation swimming there. A rock can really mess up your day. It's better to break a foot than your head. You also want to try to angle yourself at sort of 45 degrees to current so it kind of helps push you to the nearest bank. Not perpendicular to the current. That's almost as bad as trying to swim upstream. I've seen so many full grown people try to do this and almost drown.\n\nThat's another thing, like other people have said: don't panic. You'll just get water in your mouth and get in more trouble. I've fished out a few people from water they could have stood up in. Wear shoes, don't get your feet trapped under rocks, and look out for the drunk idiots who can't steer a raft. They will plow you under. Luckily I can hold my breath for awhile. Hope this helps. Wear your life vest.",

It\u2019s most important though at rivers/lakes because the bottoms are constantly shifting with seasonal flow, floods, etc.  So even a well loved swimming hole could have an underwater danger that you can\u2019t see from the surface.  Always jump in feet first, never dive into rivers, lakes, etc.  \n\nI can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been to a new swimming spot or pool and have seen people diving in head first.  It is terrifying to see, because this is a great way to get a head/spine injury.  When i was little, I took swimming lessons at a rehab center for people with head/spine injuries (only place nearby with a heated indoor pool) so I\u2019d see tons of people in wheelchairs fully paralyzed, and my Mom would whisper to me \u201cif you dive into the pool you\u2019ll break your neck and end up like that dude\u201d",

People can still die from the after effects of nearly drowning (aka dry drowning) if they don't seek medical attention afterwards.

We used to set up rope swings, have jumping spots where we had made death markers and dived to make sure it was safe to jump and there was no debris.  \n\nIt was about 100 yards across and a really mild current to swim to our spot.  As long as you don\u2019t fight the current you just swim across it and you land wherever you land and walk up the shoreline to where you want to go it\u2019s an easy swim.  A new guy came with us, he has swam his whole life, but never in a moving body of water.  Whenever there was someone new we paired them with someone to swim beside them to make sure they were ok.  We were at about the halfway point and the guy turns around in the water and looks me in the eyes and says \u201c I can\u2019t do it\u201d and just sinks.  \n\nI immediately dove under searching for him for what felt like an eternity, grab him, pull him to the surface and he\u2019s going between dead weight, thrashing, and choking me.  I finally get him to shore and it was one of the closest times I\u2019ve thought I might die.  By the time I get him to the shore I collapsed and someone else had to pull me out of the mud.  \n\nHe was a good swimmer and would have been fine.  He had never swam in a current, panicked, and gave up.  Currents are totally different than lakes or pools.  Oceans are different than rivers. Always be careful in water.  It\u2019s more powerful than we assume",

            "comment": "Some water safety tips:\n\n1. Cold water\nIf you fall into cold water, relax and focus on floating, the cold water will give you a shock and you will immediately panic so focus on staying calm and not flailing around, stay calm and float don\u2019t try and swim. Once you\u2019ve gotten over the initial shock of the water and you\u2019re calm and floating then you can start to swim however remember this:\n\n2. Exhaustion and cold\nYou will get exhausted faster in cold water, if it is too far to swim to shore get the attention of someone by waving your arms in a large motion over your head, swimmers don\u2019t wave their arms over their head so this is immediately recognised as someone in trouble. If you need to preserve warmth and strength, curl up in a ball and float, practice this in a pool and hope you never need it (it\u2019s called the mushroom float).\n\n3. Beware of sandbanks\nSo you\u2019re walking on the beach, you\u2019re quite far out but so is the tide, you haven\u2019t checked the tide times but you figure it\u2019ll be ok. You get to the end of your walk and start heading back, suddenly you realise the sea has come around you and you\u2019re trapped on a section of sand getting smaller and smaller. Wave, big arm motions again, get someone\u2019s attention. If you have the means call the lifeboat, if you know where they are signal the coastguard (it\u2019s a good idea to check where they are before you go on the beach). Unless you have to DONT try and swim in the sea, there will be a strong current around the sandbank. Once the tide reaches you your best bet is to float and keep trying to signal to shore.\n\n4. Be prepared\nKnow your beach, know your river, know your lake. How strong is the current? When is the tide coming in? Where is the sinking sand? Where is the mud? What do the signs say? Where is the coastguard? Do you have your phone? Does someone know where you are? Practice your floats, read up on water safety and take classes if you can.\n\n5 look after your kids\nWatch them in the water, teach them about the dangers of the water, best thing in the sea is to teach them not to go in above their hips. Have them take swimming lessons, even if you live nowhere near the sea, you might go on holiday or jump in a lake or river or something.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a be all and end all guide, do your own research and find out about your local guides and safety information. Just be prepared and aware and you\u2019ll be fine.",

People over estimate their ability to swim all the time. I look back to the shit I did in the ocean as a kid and I'm stoopid lucky to be alive. \n\nI moved to a state that only has rivers and lakes and it took a long time for me to be comfortable with the inability to see and the day to day changes. My favorite swimming spots can quickly become death traps and this was stuff I never learned as a child. I like to think I'm an excellent swimmer and had I stayed in FL I would have stayed on the swim team my whole childhood and through my teenage years. Despite this, I always make sure to exercise caution and hope to teach any children I may have one day the same. I've seen a girl almost shatter her leg jumping off of rocks, she was so lucky to only end up with a nasty scar and seen plenty of kids on the news for losing their lives that way. \n\nDon't jump off of things, especially if you don't know what is under you, and get out of the river if it is raining or rained in the last couple days.  \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.

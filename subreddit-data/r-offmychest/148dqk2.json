    "postText": "For context: my friend pointed out that a pair of clothes i was wearing was something that i had already worn the week before. She did this multiple times. My reason for this is that my clothes don\u2019t get washed that often due to high electricity prices. I also only have a small amount of clothes I want to wear to school due to the fact that half of them are things i\u2019m not comfortable with wearing. Because of that I wear clothes two days in a row and tend to mix and match the weeks after. After my friend pointed it out i realised that i rewear clothes super often. Is it weird?",

Fashion trends rise and fall in a matter of hours so it\u2019s no wonder people are so concerned with other peoples clothes. \n\nNo, it\u2019s not weird. I\u2019ve been wearing the same 3 outfits for months because I lost a bunch of weight and nothing else fits me but sweatpants. I\u2019m 26 and I promise you no one cares after high school and if they do, then they\u2019re still mentally stuck there. I still have clothes from high school!!! Idgaf, if it fits and it\u2019s still cute, I\u2019m gonna wear it. Wear whatever you want, those people could only dream of being as comfortable as you.",

Lots of people have their favorite clothes and wear them often or multiple days in a row. \n\nNow I, I have a closet full of the same black tees and the same jeans and I wear the same thing every day. That\u2019s probably weird.",

I\u2019ve noticed this more with girls, possibly because they have more clothing options or because society focused on their appearance more than men\u2019s appearance. Either way it\u2019s not weird, personally I have 2 shorts I wear all the time and one pair of jeans I wear for special occasions. Then maybe 5 different short sleeve t-shirts I just throw on depending on my mood.",

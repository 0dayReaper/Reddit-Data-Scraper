    "postText": "So\u2026 my life has been a shit show the last several months. My baby sister/best friend died in February of an overdose. She was 22, gorgeous, and sure- she partied once in awhile- but this was so unlike her. And circumstances are suspicious and no other drugs were in her system. There\u2019s a guy in jail and he\u2019s not getting out anytime soon. It\u2019s been hell. She was my kids\u2019 favorite aunt. She and my oldest grew up together. She did everything with us. She was the person I talked to about anything and everything. She was my biggest cheerleader, and I, hers. Anyway, she\u2019s gone and I\u2019m broken. I\u2019m depressed and angry and sad and ugh. \n\nMy MIL has been having a lot of medical issues. Last fall, she had a stroke. Then another and another and, well, she\u2019s had a lot of strokes since last fall. Her pos husband- not husbands father- literally dropped her on our doorstep the weekend before thanksgiving with a suitcase and a backpack. She can\u2019t work or drive or talk or cook or do anything anymore, really. She just watches tv. And she was staying with us and also with a friend, but her friend feels it\u2019s too much now and she should be in assisted living, so she\u2019s been with us full time since April. \n\nAnyway, in may, she had another stroke and a seizure that time with it. She was hospitalized for about a month- including rehab. \n\nWe have a 3 bedroom home and 3 kids. She\u2019s been living on our couch. I think it\u2019s too much to have her here. Too much on me and our kids. We don\u2019t have room AND I had to cut back my hours so I only work evenings and weekends. I\u2019m terrified something will happen on my watch. That my husband will hate me. I\u2019m resentful because I feel like I NEEDED this summer with my kids. That WE needed this summer. And my 3yo and 8yo shouldn\u2019t have to spend their summer home taking care of their grandma. We should be outside, away from the nightmare we\u2019ve been living for the last 4 months. \n\nWhat if she seizes in front of my kids?? They are still traumatized from losing their aunt. We all still burst into tears all the time. Music makes me cry. I am just not up for this- I can\u2019t handle it. I mean, I look like I\u2019m keeping it together- I hope- but I have so many days/nights where I can\u2019t eat or sleep. I don\u2019t feel like me. I\u2019m so angry all the time and I have no patience anymore. I was hoping we\u2019d heal some, this summer. \n\nI feel like my life is falling apart. I\u2019m overwhelmed. This may be the end of my marriage. My husband already said he\u2019d pick his mom over me and the kids. Fuck.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m very physically sick right now, I\u2019m in my early twenties and I have not done a single thing with my life. I might come off either too entitled or up my ass, or whatever but fuck it, cause why does any of this matter at the end of the day?\n\nI dropped out of high school after someone ended their life and I had found their body hanging. I was about 15 at the time and I had my mother bruised and beaten for years by said person before that, I had even tried to kill him once and I was only twelve, but I didn\u2019t cause\u2026 I did love him and looked at him like a father.\n\nLong story short, teachers treated me like a strange kid, I was quiet, but irritable, I was very hardworking and at times I didn\u2019t lend a hand, I was the class clown to impress but half the time I was just a stupid fucking kid who lived in a cockroach infested appartment with a drunken dad watching Fox News, chain smoking almost two packs in one night to pass out while I had no room due to my older brothers taking it since we lived in New York, in a shitty small appartment.\n\nMan what a mess, I\u2019m sorry if all of this seems like word vomit, honestly.\n\nTo really just emphasize and get to my point, I\u2019ve been unemployed for years, I lost all motivation to function and I\u2019m a freshman high school drop out. Money doesn\u2019t interest me, I tried plenty of jobs but realized they all treat their workers like trash and expect them to bust their ass for the lowest wage they can dish out,\n\nI realized hard work doesn\u2019t get you anywhere or at least majority of the time. School never allowed me to be a kid and eventually before I knew it I became a pothead abusing flower as much as posssible to escape reality because I was disassociating so fucking hard. \n\nOver time my mental health deteriorated because I stayed isolated up to now, barely leaving or socializing.\nSo now here I am. I\u2019m confused, comparing myself to everybody, feeling unaccomplished and what\u2019s more frustrating is that everything around me seems so bleak due to inflation and the fact I\u2019ve been in poverty since birth and it\u2019s never changed one bit. Half the time, I just stopped caring at this point, because a part of me had already accepted that nothing will get better and I\u2019m tired of feeding into the delusion that it will.",

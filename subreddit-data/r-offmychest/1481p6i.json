    "postText": "A lot of different people might relate to this. And I\u2019m sorry if you do. If you\u2019ve been on either side of the relationship, I\u2019m so sorry.\n\nI don\u2019t love my girlfriend. For some context my girlfriend and I are a lesbian couple who started dating a year ago in March. (We are both 16 years old now) I\u2019m her first real lesbian relationship and she is head over heals, madly in love with me. But I feel nothing. Last night I had her over at my house and she was talking to my dad, getting along when the subject of the future was brought up. \n\nMy girlfriend, let\u2019s call her Sally, said something along the lines of \u201cI would like to marry your daughter after high school.\u201d And I just smiled lightly and looked away. I for one don\u2019t want marriage. In fact I\u2019ve already planned on moving across the country away from the state we live in currently. And when sally said that, my dad was thrilled. All he\u2019s ever wanted was to walk his little girl down the isle at her wedding.\n\nMy sister noticed my discomfort and texted me \u201chey, are you alright.\u201d. I replied with \u201cnot sure\u201d and the conversation ended there. After awhile I excused myself to my room and sally followed and so did my sister. We chatted and hung out for awhile and then sally went to the bathroom.\n\nLeaving me and my sister to chat, when she asked me \u201cdo you even love her?\u201d And all I could do is stare. Then I shook my head in shame. I know I should love her. She\u2019s a decent person. But she admitted to me that all I was to her was an experiment. \n\nTime skip to late night conversation I asked about the experiment and everything. She replied with \n\n\u201cI was never supposed to make it this far. I was planning on dumping you after a few months of dating you. Now that I didn\u2019t, I haven\u2019t been happier.\u201d\n\nAnd all I did was close my eyes. I feel no emotion towards this woman. No negative nor positive. She\u2019s an awesome friend.\n\nI guess another factor on why me and my girlfriend don\u2019t work is that we have two completely different personalities. We don\u2019t click. In fact we barely even talked when we were friends. We were introduced by our mutual friend, John (not his real name obv for privacy reasons). \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I want to split with her, but my dad expects me to stay with her. \u201cYou have no social skills, you are not gonna be able to find another lover.\u201d He told me. And honestly I\u2019m ok with not having another lover. I just really don\u2019t wanna break Sally\u2019s heart because I know it will shatter into a million pieces.",

            "comment": "Your dad is awful.   **Do not listen to him.**  He's emotionally abusive and  actively trying to sabotage your self esteem for some miserable reason that is entirely on him.  Bide your time until you are 18 and work as quickly as you can to become independent of him.   Do not go to him for advice on relationships, nor should you confide in him more than you absolutely have to tell him.\n\nYou will have other relationships.   It's absolutely normal and frankly expected that teenagers break up.   You are growing and changing as people, and it's just completely normal to drift apart from people, even people you were very close to. \n\nYou are not your girlfriends possession.  You are allowed to have feelings and needs of your own.  And you are allowed to put your own well being first.  She may be hurt, but **that's okay.**  She'll get over it.   She'll have other girlfriends in the future.   You won't be ruining her life.   Stringing her along is not kind to her nor is it good for yourself.\n\n This was a practice relationship that will teach you lessons for your next relationship. One important one is the value of being proactive with your communication.   She should not be thinking of marriage when you are thinking of breaking up. There should have been talk about the problems long before this point.",

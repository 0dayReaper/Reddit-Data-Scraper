    "postText": "23M, virgin with little dating experience. Results on dating apps are nonexistent, and every time I see an attractive woman at a bar or get introduced to someone through friends, I just know that they're not going to have any romantic interest in me and it makes me feel depressed. I don't even bother trying to flirt or make them laugh. I'm too short, too dumb, too ugly and too boring to deserve to even go on a date with an attractive woman. The odd time one tries to talk to me, I freeze up and start to think about how this might be an opportunity to find a girlfriend, and then I can't think of anything to say.\n\nI've only recently adopted this defeatist mindset, but it's due to the experiences I've had in trying to find a girlfriend. I have asked out/flirted with many girls in the past, with little to no success, and I'm only getting more unattractive as I get older.I used to at least get matches on Tinder, now I get none. \n\nEverything just seems so pointless; getting a girlfriend is the only thing I care about, and I know that's part of the reason I can't get one, but I can't help it. I've had little to no attention from women I'm actually attracted to my whole life, and I'm sick of it making me feel bad about myself.",

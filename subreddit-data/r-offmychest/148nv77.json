    "postText": "If you work for the Irs, go jump off a bridge. Or any form of government that decides what we owe and over spends my money. So stupid the only way to fix anything is to sit on hold forever and get rude people who are absolutely no help. Second time calling and spent two hours on hold just for them to say they are having \u201cservice issues\u201d and end my call. When they are trying to say I owe money from years ago. Give me a bunch of fees for not paying a balance that was never there before. What a joke. Hate the system and anyone who believes we are the best country. We are trash and all we care about it taking money and spending in of crap and then having us pay out of pocket for more trash. So annoyed and so tired of this bull crap.",

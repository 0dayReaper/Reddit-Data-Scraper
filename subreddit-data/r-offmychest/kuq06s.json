You can have a seizure, fall over, and that\u2019s all she wrote. Check with your doctor. Whenever we have someone sign up for a detox program we tell them to keep drinking until they are at the hospital.  That might not be you, but just an honest conversation with a doc about how much you drink will let them know if you need medication to get clean. Do it the safe way, cause all of us here are proud of your resolve.",

I want to say this to you and everyone, that may read this.\nIf you or anyone relapses...DO NOT BRING APON YOURSELF THE FEELING OF GUILT!\nGuilt only leads your conscious downward. \nThere is no positive to guilt.\n#1! It is what it is. Own it. Recognizing that the relapse is shitty is ok, but don\u2019t beat yourselves up about it. Just try it again.\nTake more of a scientific approach to your relapse. What time was it? What mood was I in? \nWhat could have provoked my relapse? \nAlone/crowd? Family? Addiction? \nGuilt won\u2019t enter your mind when it\u2019s too busy figuring out the why, putting a plan together that you feel will trump the \u201cwhy\u201d, and going for it!",

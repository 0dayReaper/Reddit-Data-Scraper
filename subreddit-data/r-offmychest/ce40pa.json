    "postText": "7 years ago, when I was 24, my wife was killed in a horrible car accident, leaving me (in complete shock and grief) as a single father to our 2 kids (at the time they were 1 and 3 years old). I didn\u2019t have any post high school education and was working as a construction worker. Before my wife passed away, we both worked full time and were able to rent a small but nice house. But as a single working parent, I could hardly make ends meet and had to move in to a tiny apartment. That Christmas, when I didn\u2019t have enough money left over to get my kids the gifts they deserved, I really knew I had to do something. I started taking college classes at night while working 2 jobs, and after five long years, I graduated with a BS in mechanical engineering and got a job making 6 figures. I bought a nice house with a huge yard for my kids to play in, built them a treehouse, and have enough time off to spend plenty of time with them. Last week, I took them on a camping trip in the mountains. It\u2019s not until now that I really let myself believe that I actually did it.\n\nEdit: thank you so much to everybody! I\u2019m very overwhelmed by all the replies. I will try to answer as many as possible.",

You should be proud.\n\nThis is a great example to people out there that they should never give up no matter what and eventually they will succeed.\n\nI'm really pleased for you. Im sure it is difficult to switch gears after this struggle and it is something I have found myself to be difficult because struggling for so long becomes a habit and you don't know how to do anything but graft. \n\nBut learn to relax a bit more now and put a bit of effort into your own happiness. I think your wife would want you to be happy and find a new partner.\n\nIt's amazing what you have done for your kids but find a bit of happiness for your self as well.",

I was raised by a single mom and remember her struggling to make ends meet between providing for me, working and going to school. She finally got her degree and became and teacher and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of her. I know a bit of that struggle, and it\u2019s not fun. Life never stops throwing challenges at you but it\u2019s amazing what people can overcome. I really am so happy to hear that you\u2019ve made it man, I wish you and your kids nothing but the best.",

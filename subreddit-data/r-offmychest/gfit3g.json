    "postText": "She is so perfect, so fragile, so beautiful and innocent and incredible. Mum was an absolute hero, she was induced at 9.30am wed and after 27hours involving a very emotional three final hours and some forceps, my wonderful wife, and the incredible maternity team at the hospital delivered her healthy and adorable. \n\nIt kills me that I have had to come home and leave them both there while the epidural is slept off. I can\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m too excited for tomorrow where I can see them both again.\n\nIs it morning yet?\n\nWhat about now?\n\nMe and the dog are lying on the bed, waiting for baby Isabella-Rose to come home to us. Whatever shit is happening in the world right now... I don\u2019t care... my daughter makes everything ok.\n\n[Edit] erm... I fell asleep and woke up to hundreds of notifications. Thank you so much for all your kind words and support. The silver, gold and platinum award things are very generous, thank you\n\n[Edit 2] some people have messaged, and privately contacted me, quite angrily, feeling that we should have adopted, I understand some of the emotions that leave you feeling that way. My wife and I did start down the adoption path and are likely to adopt in the future. I also have an adopted sister who I love very much and two wonderful foster carer parents. I have never claimed to be virtuous or good, I think you wonderful people whose first thought is that they would prefer to adopt are brave, thoughtful and giving. I am grateful people like you who will adopt instead of having your own children exist in the world.",

They took us in and raised us on their own they were high school sweethearts that were in their 30s and couldnt have kids of their own.\n\n\n They brushed up on why they couldn't a few times but all I knew is it was medical. To this day we believe without a doubt they are our mom and dad. Taking 4 kids ages 4-10 (all 2 years apart) must have been rough.\n\n\nI know OP or no one will read this but from the bottom of my heart, I wish all blessings and happiness to you all. Effin congratulations Mom and Dad.",

The whole birth and subsequent time spent in nicu were just a blur - totally not what you expect or see in movies. You just always think everything will go fine. But one night while I was sleeping on a chair in the nicu room beside our son, I woke up to get the next batch of breast milk ready and noticed my sweet husband left a handwritten note beside me where he wrote out how grateful he was for me and for what I went through, for giving us the gift of a family, for being the \u201ctough\u201d one. He captured the emotion and feelings of that experience and it is forever frozen in time. With all the pain meds and exhaustion and chaos around our sons birth I really don\u2019t remember a whole lot. I\u2019m so grateful my husband wrote me that letter because I can keep it forever and re-read it and think back about how those early days unfolded, how we felt. You\u2019re bursting with happiness, excitement, love, and all those beautiful feelings associated with being a parent for the first time. Write them down so you can cherish them for all your years. Good luck dad!",

Her infant face was imprinted on my heart and I could not wait to hold her again. She has the same name as your wee girl and is off to train as a nurse in a few months.\n\n  \n\n\nMy only advice is the same that was shared with me on that first day of fatherhood... enjoy it, because they will grow up so fast. And looking back, I can say she really did.\n\n  \n\n\nCheers to you, mum and baby.",

    "postText": "what do i do? i\u2019ve been constantly fucking up. i don\u2019t feel bad for myself or anything, i\u2019m more pissed at myself if anything. i think i cheated on my boyfriend, i\u2019ve never cheated before. a random snap user id never chatted w/ before slid up on my story of a video of my cousin jumping into the pool, asking me where i was from. he kept asking questions n i realized he was tryna find out where i lived so he could come over to me. i never even open random snaps. why did i do it tonight. he asked for a photo of me bcos he wanted to know if he knew me from somewhere. he kept texting so i kept entertaining him, but i felt disgusting and terrible the whole time. i sent photos i never ever should have sent. i told him many times no,i\u2019m in a relationship and that i didn\u2019t feel okay with sending pics. but i did anyway. what is wrong with me. didn\u2019t want to fucking talk to this guy i don\u2019t give a flying fuck about his existence. and that\u2019s what makes this worse right? how did i let myself do that? how could i have done that?? i hate myself for it. it\u2019s not like me at all, it\u2019s eating me up inside. i can\u2019t talk to anyone about it. i\u2019m in a fucking relationship. and i love my boyfriend, he is a light in my life . but how could i have done this to him. he wants to be with me, he truly loves me. i make him happy, i make him laugh, and while i see him smiling so big at me i just think of this terrible thing i did, and the only reason he still smiles at me is because he doesn\u2019t know. and if he knew, if i ever told him, he\u2019d leave in a heart beat . i know what i did was beyond disrespectful to him and disobedient, but there\u2019s no way to make it right unless i told him. what do i do?",

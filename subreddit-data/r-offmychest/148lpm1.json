    "postText": "My boyfriend (22m) and i (19f) have been together a year and 3 months now, and i truly do think it\u2019s been the best decision in my life and we have plans to move in together at the end of July. A few months back, my mental health was really bad and i had a shit ton of anxiety and panic attacks so i couldn\u2019t work as much as i wanted to due to not being able to function and being sick all the time. He works consistently and I\u2019m getting better and I\u2019m back to working consistently, but today i had a panic attack at work due to some underlying issues. This is the first time in a while I\u2019ve ever had to leave work due to mental health problems so it made me feel like i was sinking back into the mentality i had months ago. I call my boyfriend whenever im feeling this way and he tries to make it better but he ends up getting stressed out and panicky because of what i have going on. It\u2019s started to get on my nerves because when I\u2019m having bad days or moments, the last thing i wanna do is have to deal with his shit on top of what I\u2019ve got going on. He was ranting about how stressed he was as we were on the phone and he says he doesn\u2019t know if we\u2019re gonna be able to get a new place. This made me feel even worse because when i was having all my mental health issues, he said i need to step up and help although i was already doing what i could with the money i was making. Obviously i know i have to do my part and i was trying my best every single day giving the circumstances, but at the time my best wasn\u2019t good enough I guess. Now that i have a good job and ive been working my ass off for a while, having this slip up today and him making a comment about moving in together made me feel like what im doing is still not good enough and it\u2019s very discouraging. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we have a solid relationship and every other aspect about it is fine, but i just feel like whatever i do is not good enough or it\u2019s going to cause a problem. But i can\u2019t tell him that either because its gonna make HIM feel bad and like he\u2019s not doing enough as my boyfriend. I dont want him to feel that way because it\u2019s not true at all, but i dont know that i can tell him what I\u2019m feeling if that means he\u2019s gonna shut down and overthink about it. I just want to be able to have a conversation about how im feeling without him feeling like he\u2019s the worst person in the world.\n\nI would put a TL;DR but there really isn\u2019t a way i can sum it up right now.",

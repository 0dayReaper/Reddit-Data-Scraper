    "postText": "I grew up in a household where both my parents are absent due to them working abroad to support our family. Since I was a child I have a babysitter until now that I\u2019m 17. Growing up she took very good care of me and stood as my parents. As I get older she became more strict to me towards boys and going out. Now that i\u2019m 17 I get pretty annoyed on her rules (no male friends, no going out without sharing my location, when i\u2019m out I must videocall her every hour, and no locking of my door). I get that she\u2019s very protective of me and doesn\u2019t want me to get hurt but i\u2019m already 17. I know the consequences of my own actions and I\u2019m willing to face it. Recently we got into a heated fight because she saw that I was on a game with another guy (this guy was my classmate and we don\u2019t have something going on) she kept persisting that it was my boyfriend and kept lecturing me on how I will get pregnant. At this point i\u2019m just so drained on her strictness\u2019s and even surpluses my parents rules.",

This is basically practice for being an adult and the babysitter at your age is going to hamper your ability to adult properly if you go away to college or anything like that,",

I'm not sure what I would do in this situation, but maybe sit down with her and have a conversation bout how your feeling? You are 17, personally, I don't think you need a babysitter. Just my opinion, hope all goes well!",

This seems very bizarre that a 17 year would still need a babysitter. What are they going to do when you turn 18 and are a legal adult???",

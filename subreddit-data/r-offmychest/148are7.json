Well that hurts but what hurts more is really just the feeling of only burdening others. When I feel comfortable I talk a lot. This just feels burdening but I don\u2019t even know how to stop. It just hurts I\u2019m really just being myself and I\u2019m really authentic but it\u2019ll always be too much.",

Maybe the people around you do not have the emotional capacity to give you those things or maybe they don't want to, but there are plenty of people out there who are extremely emotionally giving and would probably greatly appreciate and reciprocate those things like you desire. Maybe you just need to meet new people, maybe you just need to talk to the people you are surrounded by now. Maybe a little of both. I hope you find what you're looking for regardless, good luck.",

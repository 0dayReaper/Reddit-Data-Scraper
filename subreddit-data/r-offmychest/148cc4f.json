    "postText": "So, I had to kill a litter of kittens with the heel of my boots, and I kind of liked it.  \nThis was a while ago, almost a year I think. It isn't the first time I've done something like this. I had to kill a bird that my cat had caught, I feel bad about it because the bird was in pain. Now this could be heavy copium, but, I think I 'enjoyed' having to take out the kittens because they didn't experience any pain.",

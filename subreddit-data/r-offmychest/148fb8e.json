I do not have similar things with everyone. \n\nI have given up trying to have fun with people isolating myself from everyone for a long time yet I desire to have companions laughing over simple matters.\n\nAnd now regret fills me everytime knowing I will always be like this at the end of college to the rest of my life.\n\nI dread that living alone is now closer than ever but at the same time I enjoy it.\n\n\nI am a walking contradiction.",

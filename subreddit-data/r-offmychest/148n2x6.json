    "postText": "So I feel sometimes like shleprock the character from Jetsons I think anyway he always had bad luck? I am on snap last year they were behind on recertifications and I waited 4 months to get them even though I'd done the paperwork early. So 5 months later I again have done the paperwork and haven't received them nor any notices so I called. They are still behind and so I was told to call back in 48 hrs. Like last time. Idk what it's like elsewhere but just seems like it shouldn't be acceptable that people in ne\u00e9d wait 4 months for the government to catch up. It's not just snap though. There are a few places of authority where I live that just do as they please and out of fear it's accepted. I'm sick of it. It's like I try hard to take  care of myself and others and have been blocked from ever getting back on my feet. Every time some huge life changing event occurs people make suggestions of which authority to contact because this or that ain't right but nothing has ever changed by doing so. In fact it's usually made worse so why try anymore? Why be productive if times of need are not going to be assisted. Why pay taxes towards these agency's that spend more on awareness then the actual problem.? Um I'm at the point that I understand why  crime is up statistically. I know I feel like it's the only option when you think on it  because so what if you get caught at least you won't worry about food or rent or utilities etc. I'm tired of being screwed by the authorities mistakes or lack of accountability. And that's on another level when it comes to individuals that have assisted in my needing help to begin with. Fuck all y'all I'm not a victim dispite the efforts from you. Fuck my ex husband and those courts, fuck the courts in family matters from California to colorado. Fuck the judicial system for combining false accusations of family with traffic tickets  fuck the sheriff's for failing to do thier job by serving a general tpo then arresting only to then serve the papers while in  custody charged with violating said tpo. Fuck the judge that sentenced time to clear the money on a ticket then deny when asked to have tax return that was taken to pay said ticket after the time served fuck the labor dept for incorrectly handling unemployment. Creating another loss of tax returns later. I could go on like fuck the civil court judge for exparte communication and not looking at the fact that 3 other prior criminal attempts were dismissed in court. So things like filing social security survivor benefits way back and the person asked where is deceased as if I said that's a place should have been a clue that anything authority does not mean it's right when the people of position to decide can do no wrong even if they don't know that deceased means dead not a vacation destination. If I could leave I would but that's niether here nor there. If I could hold accountability of those handling decisions that effect my well being I could be happier and spread the love. But I've only had the worst experience when ever I try to be a productive member of a society that is so corrupt today. I see how mass shootings are becoming more relevant. It's never one person that drove the thoughts to kill anymore it's now a list so they get as many as possible while they can. But that's lazy I would prefer just to be allowed there when God makes his judgement. I am just grieving too much and ranting. If you got this far I apologize. Just try to be kind and spread love. Have a better day every day. I hope all your wishes are granted and be aware of your surroundings. Yeah. Thank you for giving me a safe place to get it off my chest.",

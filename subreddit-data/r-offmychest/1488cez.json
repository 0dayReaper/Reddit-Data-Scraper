    "postText": "I am recovering from a brain injury and if it weren't for this injury I wouldn't have started working out, losing weight, being more Spiritual. This accident that left me barely able to speak, walk without tipping over, forgot peoples names I knew for years, time was not linear. It doesn't even feel real. I had to slowly get faster speaking, comprehending things, do balance exercises, do memory exercises, check in with clocks a lot and taking notes. I was out of work almost 4 months but I am back working. Doctors are still working on getting my brain to comprehend some things and not give me damn near constant headaches. I was terrified the extreme diffulty speaking, walking, and communicating was going to be permanent. 2023 has changed my life so much.",

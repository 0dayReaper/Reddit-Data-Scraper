    "postText": "My mom likes to offer her \u201chelp\u201d to people, especially to me. To the point that she is offended when i dont want it, or choose to keep a particular problem to myself. She also makes you pay for her help\u2014she uses it against you in the long run. I recently graduated and she\u2019s been offering her \u201cwisdom\u201d around what to do now, but i just dont want her help bc she always finds a way to make me regret going to her.\nShe is generally manipulative and dealing with her feels like trying to negotiate with an emotional terrorist.\nAll i want to do is separate from her in all ways, but i know i have a long road ahead.",

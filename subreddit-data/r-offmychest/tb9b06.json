    "postText": "My wife is pregnant by the way and just entered her second trimester. The last few weeks her sex drive has sky rocketed so we have been going at it constantly and trust me I\u2019m not complaining \ud83d\ude05 \n\nYesterday I had to go into my office for a few hours. I get back home and caught her touching herself with a pic of me on her phone. She was looking at it so intensely, like she didn\u2019t even realize I was there so her brain was completely somewhere else. I gotta admit it would\u2019ve been hot if she was watching porn (because we do watch together sometimes) but the fact that she preferred looking at a picture of me to get herself off\u2026I mean I\u2019ve been riding on that high all day. \n\nShe told me she did this sometimes if I was on a trip or something and she missed me. \n\nThat definitely gave me a boost, and not gonna lie made me feel pretty sexy haha",

If I told any of our kinky friends about this they'd think it's cute. \n\nI dunno about the the Sex &amp; The City storyline, I have legit never watched the show.

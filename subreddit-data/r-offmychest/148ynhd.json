    "postText": "ADVICE APPRECIATED\n\nWhen I (15M) was eleven, I fell into a deep depression partially caused by my mother\u2019s (54F) intense favoring of my sibling (then 8F). I started to make up stories to online friends to get the sympathy and attention I felt I lacked, which gradually escalated until my lies included such horrific falsehoods as a friend that killed herself while on the phone with me, and a sexual assault that occurred when I was six.\r  \n\r  \nWhile large chunks of my childhood memories are gone (I\u2019m autistic and have trouble remembering certain types of events), enough has remained to know that those things didn\u2019t happen. I wrote in my diary detailed descriptions of these false events as a sort of catharsis, and once even told a person IRL about the incidents, though without details.\r  \n\r  \nAbout a year later, I had become suicidal for unrelated reasons, and my mother got worried about my mental health. She found and read my entire diary to make sure I was safe. She read everything I had concocted, which I hadn\u2019t admitted in the diary was false, and said \u201cthat\u2019s concerning\u201d. It hasn\u2019t been brought up in the two years since.\r  \n\r  \nWhile I haven\u2019t created any more major lies, I incriminated a bully for an act which he did not commit - I faked evidence and allowed it to be seized by school officials. This is the one and only time, literally speaking, that my lies have had a true effect. This person was not kind, and was well-known as a homophobe and a bully; despite that, I lied and got him in trouble for an act he did not commit.\r  \n\r  \nI have a lot of trouble making friends and finally made a real, good one a few months ago. He said he heard from others that I was raped, and that he\u2019s really sorry, etc. I told him a partial lie to refute those allegations, saying that I fell into a psychosis at age eleven and wasn\u2019t sure if it actually happened or not. I do not, and have never had, psychosis.\r  \n\r  \nI knew how terrible I was since the instant I concocted these lies, and was ashamed of doing it throughout every escalation, but this moment with my friend is the first time I\u2019ve realized the true real-world implications of my despicable actions. Not only for me, but they could discredit people with true harm and stories of abuse, people that need help. I don\u2019t need people telling me how horrible I am, because I know. I'm eaten up by guilt every day.\r  \n\r  \nAdvice welcome - am I redeemable? Is it excusable? If so, how? I'm not very good at social rules, so I don't know what the way to forgiveness would be for actions like these.",

            "comment": "It's more common than you think . My ex lied about sexual assault because she didn't like sucking dick . Finally truth came out two years later . She also one time tried telling me a story that I guess she forgot I told her about me and a crazy driving situation I got myself in where I almost wrecked really bad . Me myself used to lie just to feel included or gain acceptance .. I was one of those \" oh wow that same thing happened to me  but it was so much more blah blah blah \"  as I became less and less insecure I lied less and less until one day I had enough of my shit and busted myself out in a group setting \"na\" about a lie I had told to some of these people recently trying to make like my life wasn't fucked . I came clean and basically stopped from then on unless talking to cops or the occasional white lie here and there which I'm working on . ( I have a people pleasing issue so I rarely give people the truth if it'll hurt them ) I'm learning to just keep my mouth shut.",

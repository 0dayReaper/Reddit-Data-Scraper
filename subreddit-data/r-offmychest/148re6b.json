    "postText": "Y'know what sucks? Having rosacea. My skin is red and super sensitive. \n\nWith rosacea you have to wear sunscreen. Have to. The sun makes it so much worse. But when you are sensitive to everything you are sensitive to sunscreen too. \n\nI use Walgreens brand sunscreen on the rest of my body, but if I put that brand on my face it would turn beet red. \n\nI finally found a sunscreen that not only did *not* irritate my skin, but actually moisturized it more. I did know that could even happen. But if I still have some red on my face after my skincare routine this takes care of it. \n\nIt is $25 for 1.7 oz because of course it is. \n\nAnd this morning I had just gotten done putting on sunscreen on my body which I lathered on without thinking about because who cares if I really put too much on? It's worse to not have enough on. Then I finished and picked up my tiny $25 sunscreen to put it on my face. Since I was not paying attention I just squirted most of the fucking bottle in my hand. Because of course I did. \n\nAnd it turned overcast and cold today and I am sitting inside in a sweatshirt so the excess I put on my body so I would not \"waste it\" did not do anything of worth.",

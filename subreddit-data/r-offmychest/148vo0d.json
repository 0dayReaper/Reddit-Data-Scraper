    "postText": "You know those body scanners every airport has? I mean the ones where you step on yellow outlines and place your hands over your head. I totally hate those things. I mean who were they made for? I\u2019d say three out of four times I travel, I get flagged by body scanners for having something in my groin/butt area. But guess what? I never have anything on me. These scanners just force me to endure physical screens from agents that are just as uncomfortable as I am. I don\u2019t understand why this always happens to me, and it really ticked me off today. I wonder if I\u2019m the only one who experiences this.",

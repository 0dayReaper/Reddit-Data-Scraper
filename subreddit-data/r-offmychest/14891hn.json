    "postText": "on june 9th my sister killed herself in the backyard while my dad and i weren\u2019t home. she was always there to take care of me and help me through things and being supportive even more than my own mother\n\nmy parents just got divorced and my dad wasn\u2019t my sisters dad, but he let my sister stay no problem. my mom never comes around anymore since they got divorced and my sister told me it\u2019s because she thinks she\u2019s back on drugs and when i text her she just ignores me like she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me even before all of this happened and my dad doesn\u2019t like me asking questions or talking about it because he doesn\u2019t like crying and we are mexican catholic and from everyone i have always heard that people who kill themselves don\u2019t go to heaven. i\u2019m scared of that and i\u2019ve been thinking about it so much too. \n\ni tried finding some people similar to my situation and i saw some people posting their stories here for other people to talk to or giving advice to and i just can\u2019t eat or sleep and summer is started and i have nothing but time in my hands. even when i go out with my friends to do things they try to cheer me up because everyone knows what happened but no one knows what to say except for sorry and i get it because i\u2019ve been there to but i\u2019m just hurting and i can\u2019t escape no matter what i do. \n\nthe last time i talked to her i asked her to help me organize my fishing lures and i came back inside and she completely washed out my dirty tackle box with soap and put all of them in organized little stacks and packed them in her old backpack so i didn\u2019t have to use my new one and she hugged me and told me i should go to sleep because she didn\u2019t want me sleeping all day. \n\nAnd then while my dad and i are fishing my uncle calls my dad saying that we need to go home and when we go home we find out my sister called the police on herself and they called my mom when they got to our house and my mom never called me or my dad. only reason my uncle called is because he came over to get fire wood and the police and ambulance was still there. my mom doesn\u2019t care, she isn\u2019t even helping my dad with how to do a funeral even though she knows my dad cannot speak or read very good english. but she came to the house to get my sisters phone and clothes shoes and purses when she thought no one was home. \n\nmy cousin told me it\u2019s not my fault and that my sister knew i love her but i don\u2019t understand why she would do this to me and why she had to go. it\u2019s not fair and i miss her so much i just want too come home from playing basketball with my friends and she\u2019s in the kitchen cooking or listening to music or she\u2019s waking me up because she made me breakfast. i asked him if he thinks my sister is going to hell and he told me know but then he went and ran his mouth to my grandma who is very religious sometimes it\u2019s too much and she say me down and basically told me that when i die i\u2019m not going to see my sister in heaven because of what she did and then i got mad at her and she started asking me if all the pain my sister put to me because she wanted to kill herself should be forgiven and i didn\u2019t say anything not because i agree but i didn\u2019t know what to say. so then she told me my sister is giving me and my dad scars and pain and she made a mockery of the life god gave her and she\u2019s selfish. I don\u2019t know what to think or say to things like that but I know i don\u2019t want my sister to go to hell.",

That's a deeply personal journey, and over time a person should form those beliefs for themselves. What I will say is that, in my opinion, a loving, all-knowing god would see that a person who killed themselves truly felt there were no other options, and would have nothing but sympathy and love for your sister. Your sister loved you very much, and there's not a doubt in my mind that you will see each other again. I'm so sorry for what you're going through, and I'm sorry for what your sister went through. The things you shared, like your tackle box, will always remind you of her, but with time, they'll just be the good memories. Love will tend to outlast just about every other emotion.",

Your sister probably had something going on in her life, whatever it was she was probably in a lot of pain that caused her to do something like this meaning that she didn't made a choice with a clear mind. We shouldn't judge if others will go to heaven or hell, it's only up to God to decide and remember that our Lord is merciful. Many people especially older ones have more extreme beliefs on such topics however neither me or your Grandmother have a authority to dictate what is right and what is wrong especially when it comes to faith. I suggest that you should pray for your sister (I will pray for her too if you don't mind) and do not worry about her going to hell (because she is not going to hell), you have enough going on in your life especially that you lost your loved one.\n\nGod would not let his children suffer in hell.",

            "comment": "I'm so sorry for your loss.\n\nYour religious beliefs aren't mine and I won't tell you what to think, but I will say this;\n\nThe Bible didn't come by fax from Heaven. All religious texts are written by people doing their best to connect with a truth greater than themselves. A lot of the early rules about sin were just attempts to keep us safe- to not eat unclean foods prone to parasites, to not hurt each other, to not spread disease there didn't used to be a cure for, etc. The rules against suicide may well come from the same place.\n\nWhat we understand today that we didn't then is that suicide is most often a product of illness and profound suffering. We don't blame people for getting sick with diseases and we don't really do any more for depression. The old rules were written when suicide was seen as a selfishness, or maybe just as a misguided attempt to give people just one more reason not to do it.\n\nLook deeper for your own relationship with your vision of God. If you see that force as ultimately loving, kind, compassionate and trustworthy, maybe you can find the trust and have faith there rather than with the more fallible (human!) institution of the church?",

It would have pained Him to see his daughter (your sister) in such anguish. I wholly believe that if someone ends their life, God is waiting for them to wrap them in a big hug and tell them they\u2019re ok now. I believe this to be true for your sister. My condolences.",

Your sister sounded like an amazing and caring person, that's what matters.\n\nGod will see her for who she is and accept her in His heaven. He will understand that she had things weighing her down. God won't punish her for that. I believe that He will accept her with open arms.",

The concept of hell and suicide being forbidden is something the church created long after Jesus was dead. I know it might not mean much, but I personally believe that god is not just black and white in his judgement. He understands humans and knows their intentions and what caused us to do those things we did and does not blame humans for their actions if they were not of malicious intent. \n\nBut again, religion is a very individual thing, so I shouldn\u2019t say what is and isn\u2019t for you. I can only offer my opinion.",

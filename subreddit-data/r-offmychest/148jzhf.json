    "postText": "I (15M) have been dating this girl (15F) for a year now we basically fell in love really young.She had all of my passwords and accounts and I had all of hers, one day when I tried logging into her discord because she was being super dry while texting.\nWhile I was trying to log in it asked for an log in verification well I asked her to verify it and she did but when I logged in I realised she was deleting chats as soon as i was im and I questioned her about it she said it was nothing,I brought the chats back and it was clearly her sending nudes to other guys I was absolutely heart broken I really loved her with all of my heart I know we\u2019re young but it\u2019s just the way I am and the way I was raised.\nAnyway when I confronted her about it she stayed quiet,I asked her again and she said it was a mistake, I asked her why she did it and she said ,,because I was horny I\u2019m sorry\u201d I honestly thought she wasn\u2019t like that of course I am young I get horny too but is that really a good reason to cheat? I never even tried to ask her for nudes because I genuinely loved her for the person she was and not her body (I forgot to say that the age of consent in the country I live in is 15)Well I broke up with her and now she\u2019s begging me to forgive her saying ,,I\u2019m sorry baby I won\u2019t do it ever again please I love you\u201d well I contacted the guy and what he told me was ,,we\u2019ve only known each other for two weeks\u201d like damn really gonna throw away a year of dating for two weeks???Well she was my first girlfriend ever and it\u2019s the first time I got cheated on I don\u2019t know if I should forgive her or not please I know I\u2019m young but I love her and I don\u2019t know what to do in this situation.",

I had a similar experience and the only result I got was being continuosly played around and used. I know you love her but you should always put priorities over your emotions. I guess that's life",

She might learn her lesson and become a more faithful partner to the next person, but the fact that she not only did it but also tried to hide it and lie about it would make me not able to trust her if she faced no consequences regarding this.\n\nBut the question is: what do you want? Could you actually forgive and move on, or would it just fester and make you jealous and controlling in your relationship? \n\nWould it chip away at your sense of self-worth if you stayed with someone who didn't respect the boundaries of the relationship, or could it strengthen you to know that your worth isn't depending on your partners behaviour?\n\nCould you respect her, trust her, and love her still? And what do you need to respect, trust and love yourself?",

Do reflect away from her, so you're not influenced or pressured by her to make a decision.\n\nYou need to make sure that you know that you deserve honesty and loyalty and respect and love, and you need to know that there are more faithful people out there than unfaithful, and more honest than dishonest. If you absolutely know and believe all this, then you can choose to forgive her and choose to believe she will never hide her shortcomings and be unfaithful again. \n\nIf there is any part of you that doubt the above, that maybe think that you caused this, or that this happens in every relationship, or that anyone would do this to you, or that this is how it always is - then you need to step away and work on building your self-worth and your faith in other people. Don't let one bad event turn you bitter and suspicious of others.\n\nOne year right now seems like a lot, because you haven't lived that many years in total... But don't make the mistake of thinking something is worth continuing just because you've already spent a lot of time doing it. Relationships are worthwhile for the time they exist, regardless of how long or short they end up being. You will still have had the good times, and you can still learn from the experiences you had together, there's no need to drag it out once it goes bad.",

    "postText": "     First off wtf. I have been on such a weird rollercoaster for the past two weeks and I\u2019m just at a loss of words.\n    I (19F) have been with Noah (M20) for nearly three years. I\u2019ve always wanted something deeper, but Noah had always been afraid of commitment so I just accepted the bare minimum (stupid, I know). Throughout our time together he wasn\u2019t necessarily great at communication or providing any sort of platonic emotional connection (just the baseline on how to nurture friendships). I wasn\u2019t the best either, but it felt like I was putting forth more effort. We tried to work on it, but it just seemed like we were going in circles. \n     Finally I had enough after again another lack of communication on his end, said my goodbye, and blocked Noah on everything for the sake of my sanity (mind you, I was torturing myself everyday with the idea that I just wasn\u2019t good enough for him to change (again, stupid of me to assume he would)). Somehow he got through to me with another number, saying he finally wants to get over his fear of emotional intimacy and that he wants to start something more meaningful with me. \n     Of course I panicked, and every emotion I had prior to blocking him just flooded back. I was all over the place for a good hour and a half, on the fence about what to do. Part of me misses him, but life just feels so much lighter now without his emotional neglect on my shoulders. Is this genuine? Who knows. Is it another manipulation and gaslighting tactic? Unfortunately, that\u2019s what it seems like to me. Why would he bring up being serious now? \n     I reminded Noah of how long we were together and that what I wanted fell on his terms (he used a lot of \u201cI\u201d statements and neglected me and what I was feeling). I said my piece and blocked him again. Im just so exhausted. I\u2019ve waited three years to hear those words. Now I\u2019m finally moving on, and he wouldn\u2019t even let me do that. \n     Sorry for the rant, it\u2019s all still very fresh and my mind is like TV static. Again, I definitely made some mistakes throughout the relationship, and I\u2019m definitely not trying to play the victim (perhaps victim to my poor decisions). Despite the things we lacked, we had fun together and I do appreciate the times we shared. Noah is smart, funny, and when he is affectionate it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. I\u2019d say he set the intimate standards for me, because he was very tender and prioritized my needs in the bedroom (he was also very good at what he did). I\u2019ve never been treated so well like that before, so I was just afraid of losing that and not being able to find it again. I don\u2019t know. I just feel played.",

You can be his friend and help him from a distance and see how it goes. But I get the feeling he is playing with you, so I wouldn't advise it.",

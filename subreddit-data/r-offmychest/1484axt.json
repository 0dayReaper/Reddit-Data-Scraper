I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m sad.\n\nHe\u2019s forgotten our anniversary before, too. We\u2019ve been together for 2 years. I guess I\u2019m hoping he hasn\u2019t forgotten my birthday. He\u2019s really busy, so it could be that too.\n\nI feel selfish. I feel horrible about thinking he\u2019s forgotten my birthday, but I can\u2019t help it. I guess I\u2019m starting to think that I\u2019m not a priority to him, nor is our relationship.\n\nI wish I wasn\u2019t crying right now. I\u2019m sorry. I feel so selfish.",

If it\u2019s a requirement for you to celebrate life events such as birthdays and anniversaries he needs to make the effort on his part to. \n\nIf you\u2019ve never expressed to him how important this small detail is then you need to do it. \n\nIf after you\u2019ve explained it he still doesn\u2019t make the effort then now you know for sure you are not a priority to him.",

One day, you\u2019ll find someone who isn\u2019t so self centered and loves you so much you never have to worry about forgetting your birthday. Just don\u2019t wait another 2 years to find out you\u2019re still not a priority.\n\nHeart breaks suck but you will heal. \n\nHappy birthday \ud83c\udf82definitely TREAT YOUR SELF and go all out.",

Birthdays are special to me because it marks the day someone I care about came into the world &amp; I thank whoever is watching over us that we are able to be with them today because tomorrow is never promised. \n\nMy bf thinks birthdays are silly too but he remembers my birthday with his calendar. I would try to see if your bf is open to doing this because it is important to you. If he cares, he'll find a way. \n\nAnd lastly, I may not be him but happy birthday, I hope this new age brings you joy &amp; good health.",

You have only been together for two years.\n\nI remember crying when my husband did remember my birthday and gave me a card and showed me that he had ordered me a gift online but it hadn\u2019t arrived yet. He only ordered it 2 days before my birthday. I wasn\u2019t a priority. I cried, I explained how it made me feel, my birthday is the same date every year and you only thought about it two days before and got me whatever you could find. \n\nIt\u2019s about making the effort, being actually thought of by the person who loves you and valued. Thankfully he does now make more of an effort and realised that actually the little things mean a lot because they are things that show you care \n\nTalk to him, explain, you\u2019ve only been together 2 years and he\u2019s already forgot half of your anniversaries and half of your birthdays. Only you know if he does actually value you and if he does he may just need a reminder that things like your birthday just reaffirm it.",

I think part of it is my parents never really celebrated my birthday after i was like 9. and they are not big on the holidays either. but if my SO says its important to them ill ofc make an effort with google calendar reminders etc. have you told him that you expect your birthday and anniversary to be celebrated? but generally I just buy gifts for people whenever i feel like it or when i see a sale on something i know someone would like. which happens a lot more than holidays and birthdays.",

I had to talk to him about how I don't need him to show up in the same way I do with all the hullabaloo, but I do need him to at least put thought and effort into them, because it makes me feel like he doesn't know or care about me when he misses them knowing how important they are to me. Especially when all it takes is putting a yearly calendar reminder in his calendar to stay on top of it.",

Never asked and refused when she wanted to reciprocate because to me, I was at her service, it\u2019s about her and making her feel good. We\u2019re not emotionally tied, but I do go down on her anytime she feels down or depressed.",

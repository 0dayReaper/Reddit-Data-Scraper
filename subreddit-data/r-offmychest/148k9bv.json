    "postText": "I want to die\n\nI live in Africa but I'm a black, bi, girl I live with my mom most of the time cause my dad works in another country and I only see him for 2 weeks then he leaves for 2 months. \n1.I started feeling this way ab 2 years ago when I first realised my feelings for the same gender a month or two after the news of same sex lives was brought to the attention of the government who then made it illegal I didn't see any bad in same sex relationships so I asked my mom what the problem was with them she said they against our religion (We're Christian) so I did a little research and found out that it wasn't really because someone from Yale mistranslated it in I think in the 1870s but my mom wasn't hearing this and said it's fake even after I brought my many sources then my dad came home and said it wasn't natural even animals know not to like the same gender I said we weren't animals and have a much greater comprehension of life as is and even if if we were there are many instances of animals liking the same gender he didn't like that and shut me down immediately so I didn't speak of it again then people at my school started talking of how being part of the and I quote \"LGBABC\" community was bad and that I'd go to hell which made my friends out me and \"convert\" me to being straight after they started talking about the illuminati and how it controls the world and started talking about how abortion was bad and that even if someone lives a horrible childhood it's worth it cause they might do something really good they started dismissing my thoughts and once spent a whole 2 periods discussing how it controls us while I tried to change the subject. \n2.On top of that I'm a bit overweight for my age but it's normal for my country well not for my mom she constantly tells me how fat I am and how I should lose weight and how I'll be a laughing stock my dad isn't any better cause he's a perfectionist and blows up at me everything I do something slightly wrong he fights with my mom about my hygiene and such thing is I get too scared to tell them anything when I have a problem with my hygiene cause they'll just blame it on me I am scared to even walk into their room most of the time because I feel I'll be judged and watched over as a maid or a pet.\n3. My family is the \"perfect\" family in every ones eyes their father works daily to provide for us while the mother is diligently working at home their daughter is an A* student who ranks 2nd in their class and field I don't feel this way but no one listens when I say I'd rather be poor than live this life they say people have in worse than you some people have parents who are abusive or rapists and some people go through actual trauma other than you parents not giving you every thing you want you're just being a spoiled brat you have the perfect life, well I've been slipping my grades are getting worse and I feel like I have to work more I genuinely want to study and learn bur every time I even think of doing such my brain shuts down and I fall into an endless spiral of self doubt and emotional turmoil someone once told me that your room depicts your mental state well mine doesn't cause it's constantly being controlled by my dad and has no life in it.\n4. I have serious mental issues though I haven't been diagnosed I zone out constantly and so does my mom no matter how hard I try to do something I physically can't and whenever I hear laughs behind my back I feel like their talking about me and making fun of me I feel like I've learnt to be bossy from my dad so now I'm losing friends and I feel constantly alone no matter how many people I'm with no matter how hard I try how much less I eat or how much I try to sleep I feel drained I've searched up my symptoms but I'm not sure some times it feels like the world is closing in on me and everyone around and I just want to give up and let it swallow me whole I can't live like this anymore.\n5. I have a few health issues from constantly ignoring my pain cause my mom says I'm over reacting I've sprained my ankle twice in my life time and still have a bit of a limp cause my mom never bothered to have it checked out but I can't limp and have to walk properly or I'm faking it and it isn't that bad I've been getting weaker lately though I'm pretty sure it's from my lack of sleep I have a sore throught and a runny nose but I've been hiding it so far cause there's this little voice in my head telling me it's not that bad and I'm overreacting and it'll go soon enough \nI'm just tired. I just want to die. Also, sorry for the long read. I just had to get it all out \n6.When I was about 2 my mom hired a private teacher now she hut me abused me I'd come with bruises all over my arm for making one mistake in a question cause of that I grew up scared I never rebelled I was always perfect quiet until up until she stopped teaching me and all of a sudden she was nice and sweet and would plan birthday parties for me she started a school about a year ago and she treats the kids the exact same I'm pretty sure she only stopped because I stopped responding to her abuse anyway she invited me to teach the little kids loved me but the older ones still younger than me despised me for some reason they'd say I'm stuck up, fat, ugly I'd always come home sad my parents never noticed now they're forcing me to go back I can't and I've told them that they never listen they say I'm making it up they never believe me.\nTLDR: I want to die because the social pressure is too much for me",

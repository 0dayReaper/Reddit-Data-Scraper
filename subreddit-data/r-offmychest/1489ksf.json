    "postText": "I would just like to get this out somewhere and I feel like this is the place. \n\nIt started when we moved into a low income neighborhood and she met our then neighbors who had all 3 of their kids on disability. She told my mom that all she had to do was take me to a psychiatrist and tell them I was aggressive and would just blow up at random times and to emphasize that I was a liar. My mom decided to do it and I remember every doctors appointment she would coach me. \n\nBasically the day of the appointment would come and she would be so nice to me and tell me that when i was with the doctor I had to get angry at random times and say that I saw things and say that I couldn't sleep and i thought about hurting my siblings. She refused to leave me alone with the doctors every appointment she had to be there. And when I would do exactly what she said she was nice to me. All this started when I was 8 so the only way to get love from her was to act a certain way. \n\nThe doctors diagnosed me with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and my mom started receiving disability benefits for me. I remember never having nice clothes or ever leaving the house to do something fun I never saw any of the money coming in that was meant to be used on me. We were on a housing program that would only take 100 to 200 for rent and she had me and my sister on disability so that was almost 1700 coming in early on. \n\nThe thing that really damaged me was taking antipsychotics at such an early age. If she knew it was all a lie why would she make me take them. I remember I was taking Concerta for a while I was younger wanna say 9 or 10 years old. Concerta ended up in a lawsuit cause patients were not told that side effects would cause depression, suicidal thoughts and suicidal ideation I think a couple of people killed themselves while taking it. \n\nWhen I was in high school I was still on medication I did not need only my mom told me to continue to tell the doctor I could not sleep so he would prescribe sleeping medication. He prescribed 90 zanax and that was the first time I tried to kill myself. I had no friends cause I was not allowed to leave the house or stay after school. None of my needs were being met at home and the only time I ever felt valued was when I made a doctor belive I was crazy. Obviously my attempt didn't work and my mom made it all about herself. \n\nI moved out when I was 18 I remember having a huge fight with her before my birthday cause she tried to make herself my payee which meant she would continue receiving all my benefits so I threatened her with telling the truth and when the time came to be reevaluated I decided to act as normal as I could given all the trauma she caused. Which made them stop my benefits and I finally felt free.\n\nWhat I noticed after not being basically her little cash cow is how much I didn't matter to her anymore. She seemed exhausted every time I opened my mouth and focused all her attention on my younger siblings. \n\nThe things that stick with me still to this day  is knowing at 8 Years old how much I was worth. To her I was $800 a month that was my only value. When I no longer gave her that it was apparent to me that I was worth nothing to her. I still struggle with not knowing who I am and the shame of being diagnosed with those things even though it was not true is still with me. \n\nI feel like I need to talk to a therapist about this but after everything that happened I feel like I can't trust anyone in that field. Like how could they not know or see what was going on why did no red flags go off when she insisted on talking for me at those appointments. Why wasn't she kicked out of the room ever. All this on top of the fact that therapy is too expensive and I can't afford it is what is keeping me from getting the help i know i need. I'm 26 years old now and still can't process why she would do this to her own kids for money.",

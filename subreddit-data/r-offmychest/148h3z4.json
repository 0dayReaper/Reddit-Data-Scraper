    "postText": "As the title says, I (M21) accidentally kissed my ex girlfriend (F21) last night and I feel shit. For some background I occasionally sleep talk and walk and I\u2019m dating someone new and my ex lives with me because after we broke up I didn\u2019t want to just throw her out because she had nowhere else to go so I told her she can live with me until the lease is up. Last night around 11 I was in a deep sleep and was having a dream about my girlfriend and I was talking in my sleep and told my girlfriend I missed her, I call her baby, and I was calling out for her and my ex came in to check on me and I accidentally kissed her. She asked who I thought she was and I said my girlfriends name because I woke up in that delusional state and genuinely thought it was my girlfriend. It was not and I feel like shit. I feel I cheated and I feel I led on my ex. I apologized to my ex and my girlfriend but I feel like a dick.",

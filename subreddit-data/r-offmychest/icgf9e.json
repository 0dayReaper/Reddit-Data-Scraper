    "postText": "I never wanted kids, but was never adamantly against having one. I get married. My wife knows how I feel about kids. When we were engaged - my answer was \"maybe one, definitely not more.\"\n\nAs my friends started having kids, I started leaning heavily against having kids. Some parents had good kids. Some parents had bad kids. Even the easy kids looked like too much work.\n\nQueue my wife's sister dying. All of a sudden \"family\" is SUPER important to my wife. I get that. \n\nAt this point my answer to kids was still no. My wife bothered me and bothered and bothered me. Eventually I was convinced. The deal was her parents would sell their ranch and come live on our street. \n\nI was convinced. I was so dumb. I was told not to worry about all the realities of having a kid and losing my life - because grandma and grandpa are down the street and would be all the parents baby ever needed. Since my wife's sister died - she was the only hope for grandkids.\n\nMy wife and her parents worked me over so good. They convinced me. They made good points. My wife's parents were in their 50's and good health - they would be here \"beyond the baby phase\" and \"would have enough energy to keep up with a kid\".\n\nI'm shown enough Disney movies and Kodak moment and am promised that I just have to be a good dad and provider. A 1950's dad if you will - one where the mom unfairly does all the hard stuff. All the good and no bad? Cool - fine by me.\n\nWell here we are, 11 years later. My kid has \"ODD\" which is pretty much alphabet soup for your kid being an asshole and defiant. Nothing else is wrong with them - the diagnosis is literally that they are vindictive and cruel and seek conflict. Not because they can't communicate or are hypsersensitive to stimuli - but just because.\n\nGuess what? Grandma and grandpa say the kid is \"too much\". They haven't helped for more than a day a month in almost 7 years.\n\nAnd here I am - on reddit on my laptop, tethered to my phone in a parking lot at the park after dark. I came home from work to my son spitting on the neighbors to door knob - his reason \"get the neighbors sick\". Why does he want them sick? His amazon package got delivered to their house in the morning and they waited until evening to give it to him.\n\nWell in returning to for telling him not to do that, my son went into the attic and peed all over the one bankers box of memorabilia I have from my parents - who both died before I was 20.\n\nI left the house and am sitting in my car. I don't know if I'm coming back.\n\nAnd I don't want advice. This isn't \"lack of discipline\" or \"bad parenting\". I've read every book. I've worked shifts 6 days a week for a decade to pay for tens of thousands (probably 100,000's) of therapy, behaviorists, counseling, classes. You name it.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is my fault. I am so spineless. I knew I didn't want kids. I was convinced, because, well, I'm a jellyfish. And here I am. 45 years old, crying in my car in the park.\n\nMy advice to other men and women out there: only have a kid if you 1000% want them. Don't listen to others when they say they'll \"help\". They'll help if you have a happy, bubbly easy-going kid. Not if you spawned the devil himself.",

In order to receive a ASPD diagnosis, you must be diagnosed with something called conduct disorder (the true \u201cyour kid is a dick\u201d diagnosis) in childhood or adolescence. Conduct disorder is more along the lines of lying, conning, coercive use of force (either overt or covert), and general violation of others\u2019 rights to get what you want. \n\nIf you look in the DSM-V, the diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder and ASPD are really, really close in terms of description. Kids with ODD will sometimes garner a conduct disorder dx and eventually an ASPD dx, but this would occur over the course of several years (maybe decades) and behaviors which escalate over that time. \n\nODD occurs for a lot of reasons, and at drastically different levels of intensity. I have treated kids with ODD for individual therapy in the past. They are not beyond help, but they have to be motivated for change and it can be extremely difficult for parents as OP has illustrated. A lot of factors can influence a kiddo with ODD changing their ways, but they have to want it. IMHO, the best remedy is a strong relationship with a counselor. \n\nSource: my job is to diagnose mental illness",

No one knew exactly what was wrong with him they just knew he was defiant for no reason and actively sabotaged just about everything he could for attention. \n\nHe was absolutely being beat by his foster father. He used to not want to do PE or swim lessons because he had bruises on his arms and back. I will unfortunately never forget seeing his back in the locker room, spine showing from general malnutrition and bruises and welts everywhere.  The kid did have a mental problem perhaps but it was being exacerbated by his circumstances. \n\nHe's part of the reason I want to at least volunteer or help with CPS. He did have problems, sure, but he was a good kid in a shit situation. I think he just needed someone patient and kind to be around. When he was calm be was just like any other kid.

But true crime shows like toting the word psychopath around so good chance that's why the parent comment never heard of ODD before.",

This cluster is called \"bad\" because the behaviors associated with these disorders are often very destructive to the person's relationships with others as they are unpredictable and impulsive. Borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder (sociopathy in legal circles) fall under cluster B.\n\nCluster C \"sad\" disorders are associated with fear and anxiety, and being terrified of specific things.\n\n...as I said, \"mad, bad, sad\" is totally an oversimplification, but that's how my profs (all older people) say they were taught and remembered this when they were studying.",

They mooch off of too-generous parents until the parents are so depressed their marriage falls apart and one commits suicide. Eventually, they go to prison either for their violence or because of the road their shitty friends have led them down. Maybe, eventually, their crappy decisions will lead to their death, and you'll be in therapy the rest of your life trying to come to terms with the guilt you feel for being so fucking glad they're gone. \n\nSource: grew up with an ODD brother.

He is so clever and amazing but the discipline is lacking and it's not that I don't discipline him, he is just very hard headed and tougher to handle sometimes and I'm scared I'm handling it wrong and I'll end up doing more damage.",

She hurt animals, other children etc.\n\nWhen the hell-cat was about 9, her mother took her to an amazing child pyscologist, and was shocked when the physcologist asked her to book in several sessions for herself (the mother),  we - the friends, thought it was probably to learn how to cope with the childs behaviour - but it wasn't, she had never bonded with her daughter, she had her own issues that had caused this, with therapy to deal with some stuff and a routine established of with rules - things such as board game nights, while treating the child as she would a close friend - so no yelling, eye rolling, snappng at her, etc, but loads of laughing and praising everyone.  Also making an active effort to find things about her child she liked (don't get me wrong she loved her and did loads of stuff for her, but she didn't like her), the kid had amazing endurance, and was a crazy fast runner, and was actually super funny when she was given attention, rather than grabbing it by being nasty.\n\nToday that kid is 23, she is in no way perfect, but the changes in her almost instantly were amazing, she still takes a bit of work to bond with, but she does some of the work too, instead of pushing any niceness away.\n\nAll I'm saying is don't give up, and look at the world from your kids point of view - its gotta be hella lonely being an arsehole - and they may not know any other way",

She didn't want a kid, her ex pressured her into it and he hasn't seen him since he was 1. Due to the pandemic, I've ended up watching him 6 days out of the week when she goes into work. Previously he would rotate through some of her friends and her sister &amp; brother.  Some friends live next door, but no one could take him every day - I would as long as she didn't increase my bubble by seeing other families. I know she's almost given him up because of how hard it's been. It's hard watching him, constantly working on his behavior and correcting my kids who look up to him out of his bad choices (6, 4, 3, 1).  \n\nYes, yes, I know as a parent we have to do it anyways, but this is.... Beyond.  Sometimes I wonder if having him here is going to permanently affect my kids negatively. My mother in law (great relationship, don't knock her) has said the same.  \n\nI can't say I know what you are going through.  I have her stories and a few hours each day for babysitting since mid March through now. The only consolation I can offer is that after these months, his behavior is improving.  Enough that she's commented on it.  I'm not sure if it's the correction on my end (refusing to let his behavior go unchecked in the slightest) or my children's behavior rubbing off on him, or a combo of both. Something seems to be working.\n\nI'm not sure what the point of my posting is to accomplish.  Let you know that things could possibly change?  I don't know.  I do hope that you speaking with a professional though, this is a lot to deal with, and even if you end up staying, you will need more tools in your toolbox to help you through this.",

Regretting having children is still a taboo (at best you can talk about it anonymously on the internet and even then you get the usual comments) and on top of that your child has ODD which would make it hard (or nearly impossible) for any parent, even those who really wanted kids, to not completely lose it but that's also something most people don't want to hear. They will simply blame his horrible behavior on you and your wife because a reality, in which some children are simply \"evil\" and they won't change doesn't matter what, cannot exist. \n\nDoesn't matter what happens in the future, I hope you realize that it's not your fault he is like this and that you tried everything you could. The situation is horrible and yes, obviously if you had said no to children he would've never been born but nobody expects something like this to happen. You didn't want kids and you could've run away years ago but you stayed and tried everything possible to make the situation better. The fact that it didn't work is not your fault. \n\nI've seen a few responses telling you to divorce your wife and while I can't tell you what to do, I hope you won't do anything like that until you know why boarding school is not an option for her (whether it's because out of love for her son or out of guilt etc.). Maybe she's feeling just as miserable as you do.",

            "comment": "I see a lot of others saying boarding school, but I\u2019d recommend looking into a residential treatment facility. My brother has severe ODD and was a nightmare to live with during his teen years. \n\nMy parents tried boarding school...and he ran away after about 12 hours because they told\nhim he had to sit quietly and do homework. He walked approximately 80 miles over the next two days until he was back home, feet bleeding like crazy. Never underestimate the sheer power and stubbornness of their \u201cI don\u2019t WANT to.\u201d\n\nThey ended up settling on sending him to one of Three Springs\u2019 outdoor treatment facilities, which was basically a long-term mental health facility on the side of a mountain. It was perfect for him because 90% of it was outdoors. I honestly don\u2019t think he\u2019d be here today if it wasn\u2019t for them, he was getting more and more reckless and dangerous. They taught him how to redirect (some of) his more intense urges and he\u2019s less hotheaded than he was, but of course he\u2019s not \u201ccured\u201d just more manageable. \n\nI definitely understand your frustration, it\u2019s not a medical condition that is easily dealt with or even understood. My mother says she used to cry constantly when he was small because she couldn\u2019t keep friends with the way he acted. Spanking/physical discipline did absolutely nothing, just made him laugh.\n\nI was literally adopted into the family (he\u2019s adopted as well) because they told our adoption agency about the issues and a few months later the case worker called and said they had found a baby that was calm, didn\u2019t cry, and calmed down the babies around her and would be \u201ca perfect buffer for your son.\u201d Which weirdly ended up working for our situation, even more so now that we\u2019re older than when we were younger, but is an insane gamble in my opinion. \n\nAnyway, sorry for the essay!\nTL;DR - Don\u2019t try boarding school, try a residential treatment facility.",

Almost no one is - most of these kids turn out to commit crimes and end up in juvie because of their lack of impulse control. I truly believe you would have been a great dad to a neurotypical child but an ODD child is like a prison sentence to most. I highly suggest researching boarding schools for troubled kids like most users have said because they are equipped to deal with and respond to children without the \"I'm a parent and I feel like I'm failing\" mentality. I can't tell you it's easy to make any of these choices but I suggest therapy for yourself because I know the guilt is heavy in you and it shouldn't be. Hospitals provide parents respite care to heavily disabled children because their parents work until exhaustion to help them and you are in the same boat except your child has a mental illness.",

We were broke so we couldn't afford therapy or anything like that but we know another kid like him who had ODD and he went off to a boarding school for troubled teens. It helped him tremendously and he is doing much better now. Still has some anger issues but he knows how to cope better with them and he doesn't act out like he used to. I would recommend looking into it. Most parents don't want to send their kids off somewhere and be that parent who looks like they ship their problems elsewhere, but I highly recommend you look into it. It could save the relationship between your wife and your kid.",

We watched a lot of videos of kids with ODD throwing crazy tantrums, destroying property, etc. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I think there\u2019s a vindictive type and a type that\u2019s not. And the vindictive type was the one that turned into worse things over time. (It was a gen ed class so I can\u2019t remember) \n\nI relate to trying to be coerced into having kids. I\u2019m my parents\u2019 only child, and I\u2019m a 23 year old woman. I don\u2019t want kids bc I don\u2019t want to fuck them up and not even realize it like how my parents did me. My parents spent my whole life manipulating me, playing mind games with me, and screaming at me, and I just don\u2019t even want the possibility of doing that to a child. And my parents wonder why I don\u2019t like to be around them. Their response to me telling them I don\u2019t want kids is \u201coh you\u2019ll change your mind! I was just like you at that age!\u201d My dad says I\u2019ll change my mind bc I\u2019m a woman and it\u2019s my \u201cinstinct\u201d to have children.

Oftentimes grandmother would say \u201cI love you but I don\u2019t like you right now.\u201d And other things to the point of the fact that she was very difficult to deal with and honestly a bit of an asshole. \nMy niece lives with her mother away from them now (a couple hours drive) and it\u2019s done wonders.

I remember she spit in her mother\u2019s drink because she was mad at her over something trivial, now she just cleans her room and does her make-up. \nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that it can get better, but sometimes hearing \u201cyou\u2019re a problem child\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t want to be around you\u201d (which is what it seems that your in-laws are doing) isn\u2019t at all helpful.",

More importantly, your feelings are very real and very valid.\n\nSome people have children for the wrong reasons. Your wife and her parents were hung up on the \"family is everything\", \"child\", \"grandchild\" labels, but they didn't look at the bigger picture.\n\nA baby was supposed to fill the void of your sister-in-law's absence. And I think they pulled on your heartstrings because of this.\n\nDecisions were made and you are where you are right now. Now what?\n\nWhen a plane has an emergency landing and the oxygen masks deploy, what safety measures do they tell passengers to take? They tell people to apply the masks to themselves first and then help others apply theirs.\n\nEveryone in your household is in dire need of an oxygen mask. And you cannot help anyone until you help yourself.\n\nI would honestly recommend you, yourself, going to therapy, simply to help you sort things out and clear your head. A therapist would be best equipped on helping you help yourself.\n\nSecondly, you have to figure out what is best for your son. I disagree with your wife not considering some sort of boarding school or institutionalization. Your son needs constant, hands-on professional help and you and your wife cannot do it alone. Neither you nor your wife are considered failures for admitting that.\n\nThis doesn't mean that the two of you are giving up parenting, the two of you simply need professional assistance with a situation that neither of you, and no one else in the family, is capable of handling. Your son was born with a condition. He needs more help than any of your can give him. That is no one's fault.\n\nThird, you and your wife have to make decisions about your relationship. Would she be willing to go to counseling? Would the two of you like to work things out?\n\nI'm not going to pretend that there is an easy answer to your situation. But I do believe there are better options for you and your family.\n\nIt's an unfortunate situation all around. And I do agree with you. Everyone looks at the glories and wonderment of parenthood. But few look at the dismal realities of what can go wrong. And I don't want to come down on anyone, but, in my opinion, what your in-laws did was kind of wrong.\n\nTake care.",

He literally has zero control over his emotions due to his fucked up brain chemistry. \n\n2. Running away isn't the answer. Like it or not he's your son, which means he's your responsibility. It would be extremely shitty to run off and start a new life, while leaving your wife behind to deal with this herself. Sit your wife down, and tell her how you really feel; what's really going on inside your head. If she still doesn't listen, sign him up for boarding school and file for divorce. \n\nI'm sorry you have to go through this, but understand that a lot of people with ODD outgrow the condition as they get older. A specialized boarding school might be your best option\n\nEdit - removed comment about it possibly being Conduct Disorder instead of ODD. Don't really have enough information to make an internet diagnosis. But it might be something to look into.",

Not every kid is going to be normal or fine. Sometimes they have illnesses or diseases and side effects they are born with and that comes a responsibility for being a parent. I truly believe that if you aren't okay with possibly having a kid with a disability of any sort then I suggest not to have kids at all. Never go against your beliefs to please others, in the end there will only be regrets. Do what you want to do and live your life to the fullest because you only have one and no one else can live it for you. What is done is done and now you can only make best with what you have and sure your kid isn't perfect but you don't know how the future will look like. Things will get better if you want them to get better but that also means putting in the work and having the patience to see things out.",

    "postText": "I don't feel like I belong anywhere. You see my family is soon moving away to their home country and I am not joining them for my own safety. My family and I really have never seen eye to eye on religious and cultural matters. Although I accept their views, I don't really like them forced on me, like for example a forced marriage. Their conflict solving tactic often ends up being violence, so I won't be in contact with them any time soon. There is alot more I can get into, but honestly I can't be bothered to revist and rewrite those memories down.\n\nHere in this country I only have one best friend who I am slowly losing touch with, a school  and job that both casually remind me I am a foreinger and some old friends that I cassually meet. Don't get me wrong some people at my uni and work can be lovely and they often feel like a close family. However I have always felt like a side person, a gear that gives value in a machine, but the machine can also work without it. Also me and my bestfriend are very thight and we pick our  conversations and love right back up were we left them when seeing eachother.\n\nHowever...it still doesn't feel like home or belonging. I have tried many things to build a home, but to build one you need the people you love and the people who love and care for you to be there. I feel like I don't have those.\n\nI am told that I am young and social, that I have enough time to build one and make mistakes. However I don't see that. I see an empty future with short lived relationships that might never develop into something like family. I don't feel lonely yet, but I see myself being that in the future.\n\nThe worst part about it is that even with the relationships I have build so far, I am never able to figure how to make it feel more like a family than just friends. Maybe because I never truly had a family, just a semblence of it. \n\nJust not sure where to go from here, it's like im on a slo treadmile that slowly pushes me into an empty space I don't want to be in. No matter where I run or jump, I always end up on the escalator to that empty space. I don't feel depressed or anxious, but there is this empty sadness that grows.\n\n\nI just don't know what to do. I am not rich or good looking and my social skills are oke, but far from great. Do I have to change myself? Am I missing something? Am I too selfish for wanting a more intimate connection with the people I like in my life? At least I can say I tried when I pass away, but I wish I succeed in finding a home or creating one. Sounds so artificial \"creating a home\".",

    "postText": "I work in a small cafe, mostly I work alone in the front of house. When its not busy I tend to chat with the elderly guests that come alone. Theyre lonely and Im not busy, it works. I've had some great conversations, about life and the world mostly. I don't mind listening to some stories twice, it keeps me busy. Last year when u started my job I met the nicest 95 year old man. He came in almost every day and told me stories about the war, his childhood and his late wife. \n\nSlowly the days got warmer, and since the cafe I work at is old, it got extremely hot inside. In the summer I work with a skirt, that has a split down the middle. It's loosely fitting but I guess my legs are visible when the wind is blowing.  \n\nThe old man asked to take a photo of me today. I kind of froze up, and said yes. This man was like a grandpa to me. I didn't expect anything weird of it. Until he started making comments on my legs, and the fact I have small boobs, and he preferred that. I felt so extremely gross. This man, who I've had tea with weekly, who I trusted, looked at me this horrible way. \n\nI don't get it, why do I always end up like an object to some man? I avoid men around my age for good reason, but now I feel like I can't even be safe around way older men. Let alone at work.\n\nI didn't dare to say anything about it and went on with it day. I saw him again today. I feel truly disgusted. This man targeted me at my workspace, and now I carry safety pins with me to close up my skirt more when he arrives. \n\nFuck you. I tried to make you feel welcome, I talked with you about your children and your late wife. I mailed you a card when you got sick. You fucking suck you gross pig.",

            "comment": "Because this happened in the work place you will have to remain professional about it as I'm no doubt in mind that you are. I would mention this man makes you uncomfortable to your employer and see if anyone else can deal with him or if your boss can ban him for making inappropriate remarks about you. Unfortunately we think of old people as sweet delicate human beings and many of them are but many are still horrible which they hide under the guise of being elderly. I think you should absolutely be able to wear what ever you want in work that allows you to breathe I'm a builder so I know the heat can be unbearable. Unfortunately men will sexualise women anyway they can. And as a man I apologise for this not that I sexualise women myself. Going forward speak to your employer and be honest about how uncomfortable this man makes you and see if theres any steps that can be taken going forward. I'm sorry that he abused your trust and friendship. Good luck O.P",

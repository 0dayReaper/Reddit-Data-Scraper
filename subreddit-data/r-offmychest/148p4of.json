    "postText": "I just feel bored. I\u2019m studying engineering first year. I\u2019m doing my final exams right now and I guess it was the catalyst that made me realize I don\u2019t enjoy life anymore. I really don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing with my life anymore or why I\u2019m here in the first place. I first got into engineering cause I love logical analysis but currently it\u2019s just been a burden more than a joy. I work out a lot but lately I just do it to stay fit where before I did it because I enjoyed it. I really don\u2019t know how to get over this I\u2019ve tried doing the things I used to love or go out with friends even go on dates but my vision has gone gray I don\u2019t see the colors in life anymore. I want to give up but I\u2019m scared of failure and disappointment. I know I\u2019m probably just being immature and ungrateful but I can\u2019t help feeling this way. Currently I constantly feel like everything is worthless and I live everyday on autopilot. I just wish I could find joy again but I forgot what brought me happiness or even what happiness was.",

What\u2019s the point of getting what you want if it doesn\u2019t even bring you joy? I feel like that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen cause it\u2019s happening rn",

You\u2019ve accomplished amazing things, but if they aren\u2019t bringing you joy... Can you remember what filled you with joy when you were younger? What was the last thing that truly brought you joy? Even if it sounds silly or was a while ago, there will be something. Start scheduling more of whatever that is in your life.",

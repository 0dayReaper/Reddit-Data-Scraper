    "postText": "In April my long term boyfriend broke up with me. It was hard and it hurt super bad. Well after we broke up my ex boyfriend before him reached out a couple weeks later. Which was a wild coincidence since he had a girlfriend for roughly the same amount of time I was dating mine. He told me how they broke up and he missed me yadda yadda. I missed him too but I\u2019ve always viewed it as friends after we broke up because he hurt me so bad. I like mentally convinced myself I loved him but not like that after the break up. Huge reason why I was able to move on to my most recent ex. We\u2019ll call my first ex Mark and my most recent Chad. After a couple of weeks Mark started to love bomb me. It honestly stressed me out and I wasn\u2019t over Chad, I feel like this lowkey pushed me away. He eventually asked if he could come visit this summer and I said it was fine if we were strictly friends because I\u2019m still trying to recover from this break up with Chad. He agreed. Two weeks ago he bought his tickets one night without telling me until the next morning, with dates we didn\u2019t agree on. Since he bought the tickets he tells me he loves me and all this stuff. I don\u2019t want to be rude to him because he bought his flight tickets and he can\u2019t really get that money back. But what rubbed me the wrong way was when he said he couldn\u2019t wait to see me and kiss me. I just immediately regretted telling him it was okay to come. Well to make things worse, I met this guy at the bar last weekend and we really hit it off. He asked me out a couple of times since and last night I stayed the night at his house. During one of my dates with him Mark called me. I hung up and he proceeded to call 2 more times and I finally answered and he acted so weird and gaslighted me for being out with people. I ended up getting upset because he\u2019s treating this like a relationship when I told him from the beginning that wasn\u2019t what I wanted. I\u2019m not quite sure what to do because I see myself continuing to talk to this new boy and Mark will be coming to visit in July. Please someone give me advice on what to do. I feel horrible but I also can\u2019t force myself to love someone, no matter how great they are. \n\nI also want to note since hanging with this new guy I haven\u2019t had any anxiety like I feel when Mark and Chad are around. I feel like they both did me wrong so many times that I could never trust them again fully, so why would I ever go back to them.",

    "postText": "I explained multiple times that I don\u2019t like belly piercings and athiests. People who embody those things will likely not be my friends. I am spoken to other people on Reddit about these pet peeves, but I could not really get strong evidence that could convince me. That is why I made a decision regarding with any of friendships. I will only be friends with people who don\u2019t have a belly piercing or do not show it. This may sound harsh but, it is the right decision for now. If my opinions shift in the future, I will try to rekindle any relationships that I missed on. However, the best option for me is to avoid people who don\u2019t like belly piercings. I will be friends with my people. Other people can find those who like belly piercings. No one gets hurt and everyone benefits. Similar thing goes for atheists. I have not met an atheist who has looked past my support for religious practices. I need more to give me a new perspective. However, I just don\u2019t see how I can be friends with an atheist. I appreciate those who made an effort to change my opinion on overlooking pet peeves. It will take some time for that to happen. Unless someone else has something against me.",

            "comment": "Although I don\u2019t necessarily subscribe to any religions myself, I have many friends who do practice different religions. The great thing about being friends with people from different backgrounds is that we are able to learn a lot from one another\u2019s perspectives/experiences, which helps keep us open-minded to other worldviews and cultures. With that being said, I can understand if you\u2019d want to be friends with people who share similar values and beliefs \u2014 a lot of people do.\n\nOn the other hand, why is something as superficial as belly piercings a dealbreaker to you in friendships? I am genuinely curious, because I personally don\u2019t see how someone\u2019s physical appearance is synonymous with their character/ability to be a good friend. There are plenty of people with and without belly piercings who can be equally as terrible of people (and vice versa).",

                    "comment": "The reason why I don\u2019t like belly piercings is what they represent. I often see trends on social media that encourage other people to get belly piercings. I fear that this what will cause a rise in belly piercings. Whenever I see a person who has a belly piercing, I think they will force to like the piercings or leave me alone because I think otherwise. Also, I just find the piercing to be unattractive. If I do become friends with them, I will always see their belly piercing. It is symbol of their membership in the belly piercing movement. Avoiding a friendship with that type of person would distance myself from belly piercings. Even if a person is bad, if they don\u2019t have a belly piercing, they are a little bit better in my book. I will explore my perspective in a different way. Say that you like Lucky Charms and dislike Cheerios. Then on TikTok, a trend that states that Cheerios are the best cereal. Later, Lucky Charms are removed from grocery stores due to a lack of popularity. You later meet a colleague or student who likes Cheerios. Would you be their friend?",

    "postText": "S lol, what a beautiful name. What a beautiful girl. The most beautiful girl Ive ever seen. The girl who saved my life. The thought of her makes my heart pound throughout my body. The sight of her makes me forget our setting. I\u2019m crying lol. In a room full of women I\u2019d push through them all to find her. I\u2019d choose her every time without hesitation. I see my World in her eyes. My love. My heart in the form of a human. A 4\u201911 Mexican girl who\u2019s laugh can cure my sadness, who\u2019s smile can eliminate my worries, who\u2019s voice can erase my doubts, who\u2019s touch removes my insecurities, and who\u2019s presence allows my mind to rest. My heart. How lucky. Every detail about her body is perfect to me. Her every birthmark. The small scar beneath her left eye we have never mentioned. The large birthmark on her right hip she Doesn\u2019t think I notice. Everything. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing because I love it all so much. She could never understand or see herself from my eyes and nothing upsets me more. My dream is a life with her. I\u2019ve spent so much time visualizing it. It\u2019s always beautiful. I\u2019m always happy. We\u2019re always a success. I can\u2019t stop crying lol. No matter how hard I try I can never truly express my feelings for her with words. It is impossible and everything so far Doesn\u2019t even come close to a percent of my feelings for her. I\u2019m in love with her from the soles of my feet to the end of the longest hair on my head and everything in between. Despite this fact, I can\u2019t help this feeling that she does not feel the same about me. She can be distant and cold at times. She has made remarks and have done things that replay in my head as indicators that she Doesn\u2019t feel the same way about me as I do her. It hurts and it is exhausting. I won\u2019t give up on this because there is a part of me that believes that she believes that I\u2019m the only guy in the world for her. I just wish she would show me that instead of telling me that. The next time I am pushed away or disrespected I will have to let go and allow her to sail off without me if that what she chooses. It will break me in every which way possible. I will cry and cry and cry again. I will be destroyed and left alone. What could\u2019ve been and what already was would plague my thoughts. I\u2019ll be a shell. Empty. A million pieces. The only person who knows who I really am. My love. I pray to God often that she chooses me the way I have chosen her. Only time will tell. Please don\u2019t break me.",

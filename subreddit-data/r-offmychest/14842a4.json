    "postText": "It's been almost 6 years now that these problems began and 2 years that they've gotten near unbearable. From a very young age, as far back as I can remember, you always told me \"You're too slow, too sensitive, too weak.\" I developed anxiety and depression at a very young age from this - not that you ever noticed until it was almost too late.\n\nI feel as though I shouldn't feel hurt. You're not physically abusive. You're not even the typical emotional/verbal abusive type of person. It feels like I shouldn't have reason to be mad at you. And yet here we are. Your precious baby girl...because you can't accept that I'm nonbinary...is suicidal. And it's because of you.\n\nReally, I should just cut ties with you and move on. But family is so important to me and I don't want to lose you. I always knew sometimes chosen families were better than blood ones but I never thought that could apply to me. Why do you hate me? You say you don't, that you love me. You think that I hate you too. But why aren't you trying to fix things like I am then? I'm barely an adult - you're almost 50!! I thought adults were supposed to know what to do...\n\nI guess I hadn't realized there'd be adults like you. Claiming to be all that but in reality you're hypocritical, hateful, mean. You said I couldn't be your child because of my identity. You say you love me but your actions and words scream otherwise.\n\nWhy am I never enough for you? I've been trying to get your approval for my entire life and still...nothing. Hell, it's gotten worse the older I've gotten. What did I do? I thought a parent's love was supposed to be unconditional.\n\nWhy can't you love me mom?",

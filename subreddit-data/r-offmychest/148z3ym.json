    "postText": "I hate them. There is nothing that fills me with more rage. I\u2019m not overweight, but I\u2019ve struggled with body image my entire life and I\u2019m not what a lot of these shitbags would call \u201cideal\u201d. I hate the stupid \u201camiugly\u201d subreddits that keep being suggested to me because I keep yelling at the fatphobes on there. I hate the reels, shorts, and TikTok\u2019s that pop up where gym bros are just insulting fat women to their faces. I hate the comment sections under every plus sized creator\u2019s posts that are full of thin people shitting on plus sized people simply living their lives. I feel so much genuine hatred towards these people, I wish they would disappear off the face of the earth. \n\nI was watching an insta story of a girl who was working out and it was like \u201cthese are the things I don\u2019t like as a plus sized athlete\u201d, and then she showed some normal stuff to dislike. The comments were horrific. They told her to lose weight, said her ankles wouldn\u2019t hold up, that she shouldn\u2019t even bother because she won\u2019t ever look good, laughed at her for calling herself an athlete, and generally were just vile. On one crusty comment with weight loss \u201cadvice\u201d she mentioned having an eating disorder and everyone under that comment was like \u201cno you don\u2019t, you\u2019re fat\u201d \u201cobviously not disordered enough\u201d \u201cno one gives a fuck about your eating disorder\u201d. \n\nThey would NEVER treat a thin woman this way. They wouldn\u2019t treat a fat man this way. I hate them. They always say it\u2019s under the guise of \u201cnot promoting obesity\u201d but then when a fat person posts about getting healthy they bully them too. None of these assholes give a fuck about health. They are bad people, and they need someone to take it out on. There is obviously so much bigotry in the world but fatphobia feels like it\u2019s the only thing that media sites and society at large looks past when it is so blantant, which is why it\u2019s so frustrating. You can tell a fat woman to starve herself more on instagram and the platform doesn\u2019t see that as offensive. \n\nI\u2019m disgusted by fatphobes. I hate them so much. If these are your views, I\u2019m disgusted by you. I never want to speak to a person who\u2019s held these beliefs (same with all bigots). You are a bigoted piece of shit who deserves absolutely nothing. Leave people alone. Quit kidding yourself into thinking you\u2019re fit for society. You suck. Leave them alone.",

But it doesn\u2019t matter because shitbags like you will bully men too. If you\u2019re one of the the people who does this shit then like I said, you deserve nothing. Leave people alone. Leave fat men alone, leave fat women alone. I\u2019m so fucking sick of people like you treating people you deem unattractive like crap. Stay in your basement and don\u2019t come out. Fucking tired of society tolerating people like you.",

Fat men don't think much to fat phobic stuffs said to them coz they have been bullied like that since childhood and have become sensitised. If you aren't overweight as per standard BMI then it's probably women who are jealous of you who are bullying you.",

Broke up with my partner 6 months ago, constantly failing talking stages, struggling to find a job.\n\ni\u2019m struggling to find, or rather keep a partner, as it\u2019s ok for me to get dates but it\u2019s always \u2018i only see you as a friend\u2019 and never a \u2018let\u2019s see each other again\u2019. I know everyone says \u2018just work on yourself, hit the gym, grind for the bag\u2019, but i\u2019ve been doing this for years and there\u2019s no results at all. I can\u2019t change my genetic deposition without surgery and that\u2019s the only thing holding me back from giving me a new face. I don\u2019t think i\u2019m ugly ugly but i feel like im below average. It just doesn\u2019t help at all. I stopped using dating apps for a while due to a burnout but every night i just cry myself to sleep due to the sheer loneliness. I have many friends and family members who are supportive of me but they can\u2019t fill the void like a partner can. Everyone just says \u2018you should be happy being along to be a good partner\u2019 and i\u2019m definitely ok being independent, it\u2019s just extremely quiet to the point that the noise is so loud everything just screams at me like i\u2019m a failure, it\u2019s hard to explain. \n\ni don\u2019t know, i\u2019m just typing whatever i feel off the top of my head and i\u2019m just done with life, it would\u2019ve been way easier to not exist tbh. why is the universe so harsh to me? what have i done in my past life or in my current that demands this treatment upon me? i never know, i don\u2019t have the answers",

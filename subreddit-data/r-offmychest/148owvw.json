    "postText": "I honestly cannot believe this is my life. I was in an relationship with someone for almost a year. It was on and off again, very casual, but we immensely cared for each other. He took a job in another country, and we ended things. Once we came back home, we immediately reconnected and started talking about getting more serious. I thought he was single, but he actually met someone overseas. And while he and I were figuring things out, she was filing for a visa to come live with him.\n\nWe broke up, because I realized that he and I weren't a good match, and she moved here a couple months later. They've since ended things, probably because he's an immature coward, and I've just been mulling over this information. \n\nI always knew he had a lot of room to grow, but this just takes the cake. I can't believe I wasted so much time on him, thinking that he was such a great guy with so much potential, but as the saying goes, the truth will out. I'm just waiting for karma to hit him. Because that was really fucked up. \n\nAnd if you're reading this, yeah, I know. And you probably think you did nothing wrong. I already blocked your number so don't try to contact me. \n\nI'm just sorry to your future partners who will have to deal with you and your shit.",

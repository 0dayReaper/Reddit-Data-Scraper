    "postText": "Alittle context, i (20f) havent lived w my parents basically my whole life(since I was 5 months) &amp; I haven\u2019t lived w my sister since she was like 9months. She came to live w my grandma and stuff but then my parents got custody again. I, however, lived w my brother (18m). \n\nI had a pretty rocky relationship with my parents. As I get older, I realize my parents did put an effort into being better. But i was so young, that i didn\u2019t really know how to handle anything. \nAnyways, rocky relationship w my parents meant I didn\u2019t get to see my sister grow up or have a strong bond w her (which I really wanted). \n\nI went on fb today &amp; saw she graduated middle school bc my moms post (her fb is basically like a shrine to my little sister). She looks so pretty and it\u2019s getting more real and more painful that I didn\u2019t watch my sister grow up like a \u201cnormal\u201d family wouldve . I feel mad at my parents but like what does anger really do for me??\n\nI just wish I could\u2019ve been a sister, maybe I would\u2019ve been able to handle relationships. I\u2019ve made so many attempts to try and build a relationship w my sister. But yk, she has her own feelings and stuff, and never really reciprocated the energy. So i just left it that. But yeah I\u2019m pretty sad and defeated. My heart sank to my stomach. She\u2019s growing up so fast and I\u2019m missing it all.",

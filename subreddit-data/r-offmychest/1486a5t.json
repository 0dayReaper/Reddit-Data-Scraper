    "postText": "I lost my temper with my daughter (10) which is rare for me ever since me and her mom split up. \n\nShe\u2019s been having stomache problems for a couple weeks, you know the kind that go away as soon as she\u2019s picked up from school? I\u2019ve had to leave work 4 times in the last week and cancel her before school sitter since they were just calling me every morning. Thankfully my mom is close by to help out. \n\nAnyways it was clear that these stomache aches were associated with some level of anxiety, but she would complain after eating anything too. We tried cutting out gluten, then dairy, but nothing was consistently causing them.\n\nFinally we got her in to the doctor, who prescribed her some tiny little pills to ease her stomache.\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t take it, she said she\u2019s too scared, she wouldn\u2019t even TRY. As I was talking to her my ex kept talking over me and I just LOST IT. I yelled at her like I never have and stormed off.\n\nI later came back with the forms for her blood work (don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be the one trying to get that done) and the dude my ex cheated on me with is there, hanging out with my kids. He\u2019s the good guy today.\n\nNot my best day, thanks for listening.",

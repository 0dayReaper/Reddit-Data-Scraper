    "postText": "Today I graduated from highschool, and my school does this thing where they also give an award to people who were consistently the best at certain subjects. While I was good at most of them, I never was really the best, which is why I wasn't really confident in getting any. But for some reason my mom just thought I would get a lot of them. So to no one's surprise, when my name came with no awards, she was not happy. And when I went to her after I graduated she told me she was not proud of me. I just confronted her about it in the car and told her what kind of mother says that to her son after he graduates. This was supposed to be one of the best nights of my life, but I can't bring myself to be happy anymore.",

Even after 9/11 it was still a pretty nice place to live despite being a little more scary. But it's been steadily going down hill more and more every year and I'm not sure I would have made it to graduation if the world was like it is now back then.\n\n...so yeah, I'm proud of any kids that make it to graduation now that rose tinted glasses are in such short supply.",

Comparing me to my PhD holding, Physical therapist, sister.\n\nBut I've learned It's up to you to decide what you think is an accomplishment. I will say there are people who see high-school diploma's as a \"eh\" award since US citizens are forced to go through schooling (until high school where they can drop out legally (usually)). But there are equally if not More people who see a HS diploma as a great feat! Many people don't get their GED until 20+ years old (general education degree, similar to a HS diploma but for those who dropped out, although jobs will just state \"GED required\")\nI know a guy who got his GED at 25, living with his mother, just last year and I was proud of him. School is *NOT* easy or for everyone. I'm 23 and I have been through my phase of feeling inadequate and tbh, still do. Although, I've realized that what I stated earlier: \"it's up to you to decide what's an accomplishment\" is what matters most. It's your life, it's your dreams, it's your accomplishments. Don't let others judge your accomplishments just because they already accomplished them. With covid and standards of learning changing all the time, I think it's super impressive that you graduated!\n\nGood job dude.",

If your parents are receptive to change then try to communicate your feelings with them, if that doesn\u2019t work you have to find the self worth inside yourself, no one else can make you proud of yourself but you, and you should definitely be proud of yourself.

I have a similar mom and has said some really regrettable things to me. During my senior awards ceremony I received a medal for football and so did other students with their respective sport. I even got a full ride scholarship for school to play football too. \n\nDuring the walk to the car my mom couldn\u2019t say anything positive. It was always about her and how it made her feel that her son who she raised as a single mother could, \u201cdo it all\u201d. It was very much narcissistic behavior. We argued loudly all the way home and I couldn\u2019t help but cry because I felt as if I failed her. Mind you this wasn\u2019t the only incident. But it\u2019s one that stands out because I thought the shackles on my feet would disappear after working my butt off.\n\nYears later I\u2019m 25 now and we still talk like normal. What I found was this, that most of the time parents who are like this have tunnel vision, and it\u2019s sad because they realize later the mess they made. Unfortunately my friend, the best advice is to figure out if you even want to be near her toxic behavior. If so, you must then help guide her to be better. This is extremely hard because even though she\u2019s your mom, you\u2019ll need to teach her as if she\u2019s a child learning for the first time. \n\nBe patient with her and explain to her the pain you felt. The amount of pressure/hours and how you felt after you graduated yet she still was disappointed. \n\nAlso, your happiness is your responsibility. Don\u2019t let that toxicity take control of who are and what you\u2019ve accomplished. Just stay humble, keep working, and understand that you are your best friend that needs to speak to themselves kindly. Right? I mean you\u2019d never talk badly about your best friend to them? Would you? \n\nAnywho, I hope you and your mom find peace. I hope that you don\u2019t let that sadness turn to anger and it leading to resentment. That\u2019s a dangerous place.",

    "postText": "I'm the asshole in this.\n\nI f\\*cked up.\n\nI am in a long term relationship. Getting married in october. Another couple of friends are getting married in september. The woman in that couple is polyamorous (unlike her future husband), quite intense, a long time friend (let's call her G)... And I became infatuated with her in January or so...\n\nI don't want to be in a relationship with her. Maybe hold her close, have sex... A part of me just wanted something intense, alive. My girlfriend has been in a pretty dark place for about a year now and maybe I just wanted some color in my life. It was selfish and dishonest...\n\nConfessed to G that I wanted to kiss her. That it felt weird. She let me down gently. I thought that was the end of it.\n\nBut then she considered it and gave me a written note a few weeks later about an \"uchronia\" where we would have lived something together. Started exchanging texts... Got excited. The texts got quite clear about the desire we had. But it was clear that we did not want to ruin our soon to be marriages for this.\n\nSo when my fianc\u00e9 found the texts... It broke something.\n\nMany things actually... We've been trying to rebuild the trust I broke. It's been 5 weeks now  and it's not working too well.\n\nMost people are suggesting me to cut all ties with G, to give my couple a chance. I don't want to lose a decade long friendship over this. But the relationship cannot be ok : I'm still attracted to G. Definitely don't want to be with her. Just attraction.\n\nSo I'm stuck. I know what I should probably do, cut all ties, move on, prioritize. But it feels so extreme ! G's a close friend and I'm confident the crush will go away on its own.\n\nI'll continue to do the work... Rebuild...\n\nI just feel frustrated, guilty, angry, sad... It's just a lot on my chest...",

    "postText": "7 years ago I (29F) was assulted by a coworker at a party. I went to the police, the guy confessed, there were even evidence, yet they let him go.\nDuring the interigations the police came with comments like \"didn't you think it was a good idea to stop drinking earlier?\", \"what were you wearing?\" And \"I'm sure you like it rough\".\nIt ended with me moving across the country because I didn't feel safe since this guy was walking around and the police doing nothing about it. That whole ordeal completely broke my trust in the system.\n\nSince then I've struggled with alcohol abuse for 5 years, but I'm finally sober now and is two of years out of rehab.\n\nThen two years ago I started talking to a guy online. We meet up after talking for a few weeks, with the understanding that we would just watch a movie and nothing more. I've made it very clear that I need babysteps to get to know people because of what I've been through before.\n\nMaybe 30 minutes into the movie he starts begging for s\u20acx. I keep saying no, but he won't take it for an answer. Before I know it I have his hands around my troath and is getting yelled at. He said I need to learn my place, stop being bratty and obey every command and to get my clothes off right now or I'd regret it.\nHe finished and as he went to the bathroom I fled his house and ran home half naked. This was in the middle of the winter and sub zero temperatures.\n\nFast forwards till earlier this year, I'm trying to recover from a bad break up, and out of nowhere the guy from two years ago is messageing me again.\n\nOver the last 4 months I've turned this guy down both politely and impolitely. I've made it clear that I don't want any conntact with him. He started showing up to my work wanting to talk and hang out again because he \"misses\" me. I tell him to leave which he does, only to message me later in the day. I don't answer and block him, he makes a new profile, I block him, he makes a new profile. And so it goes on and on. This is now going on over 4 different platforms, and he has since showed up 3 times to my job. I've lost count of how many times I've blocked this guy.\n\nI've also seen him drive up and down my street several times. He's even been parked right outside my place, and suddenly I get calls from unfamiliar numbers or messages saying he is on his way to pick me up.\nI've gotten several emails about someone attempting to log into my profiles on different websites. At one point there was suddenly a new user on my netflix, with his name.\n\nMy life was finally at a point where I looked forward to each day, I was working out regularly, eating healthy. There were more good days than bad.\nI have a great job, work with great people.\n\nNow I wake up dreading what will happen, scared to leave my place, but scared to be home alone.\nMy closest family lives almost a days travle away and my friends work at sea, so they are gone for months at the time. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where I am considering drinking again because I just don't want to feel anything anymore. I've spent more hours during the night on top of the bridge than I have spent sleeping. \nIf I didn't have obligations to my job, family and some volunteer movements I honestly believe I would have jumped several months ago.",

There\u2019s better ways to cope.\n\nI know you don\u2019t trust the system but it could be different where you are now. This guy is harassing you &amp; stalking &amp; it\u2019s getting dangerous. Gather evidence &amp; report to authorities. Good luck &amp; best wishes to you.",

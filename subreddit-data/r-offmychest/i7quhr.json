    "postText": "Waiting to downvoted since this is a male dominated website but whatever.\n\nIf you have ever openly declared yourself as preferring ass over tits (or vice versa) as well as openly stated that your prefer \"big\" or \"small\" whatever then you have no right to complain when women state their preferences. If you have ever made fun of a woman for being fat, having small breasts, having a small butt etc. then you have no right to complain when someone says the same kind of remarks about penis size, height, or strength. There is nothing wrong with having a preference there is something wrong with creating a hierarchy about uncontrollable factors such as body parts. If you have ever used cruel terms like roast beef lips, pancake tits, pepperoni nipples (isn't it amazing how many terms we have used to reduce women to a consumable product) then you have no right to complain when others are critical towards your physical appearance. I think it's unnecessary and immature when people both male and female accuse people of having a small penis, however usually the first thing that a woman is attacked about is her appearance as well so your experience isn't unique. Don't want to be reduced to your penis size? Don't reduce women. You may say that you have had women lose interest once they found out your height or penis size, and once again your experience is not unique. Many women are turned down due to their weight and level of perceived beauty. Never ever have I seen a man's accomplishments be belittled or undermined by how \"fuckable\" they are perceived as. Don't want people to be judgmental towards you? Then stop judging others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for every comment, upvote, and award. I wanted to offer a different perspective and am happily surprised to see such a positive reaction overall to a such a societal conundrum. I think we all just want to feel appreciated and valuable, so we all should try harder to facilitate that for others. Being able to appreciate the diversity of beauty in return increases our own. ",

It\u2019s normal to have physical preferences; we can\u2019t logically explain attraction. It\u2019s not normal to objectify body parts as a pedestal for attraction especially when they\u2019re judged by size. \n\nThe few times I\u2019ve been in women lead conversations about penis size, they were so general they were laughable. No personal names or comparisons, not very graphic or derogatory. This is very contrary to my past experience sitting in male lead conversations or reading countless threads on the internet. It just speaks to the average woman\u2019s experience.",

Because it's equally as disrespectful for a guy to ask how big their tits/ass is. Of course, if you're telling a friend you like tall guys then there's nothing wrong with that, nor having your preferences. It's just a sensitive subject for guys unfortunately. If a guy has preferences for slim women then it still is insulting to ask how much they weigh even if it would save a lot of time.",

But I\u2019m a Demi, so doesn\u2019t really matter to me.\n\nEven if this is lot more common than I think, well I hope people can talk about preferences without only sexually viewing the opposite gender",

I don\u2019t think finding someone to love regardless of their physical appearance is too out of touch, and that\u2019s kind of rare in this world. It\u2019s bs how we judge others nowadays. So many people are bullied to the ground because of their bodies, and it\u2019s disgusting. All I said was that people desire certain things and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. Again me personally could care less.",

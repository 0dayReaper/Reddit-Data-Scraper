    "postText": "honestly I really don't know what too really feel in all this all feels unreal and I'm literally alone..\n\nlook at my previous post here lol yeah it got worse and I'm alone like fuck me . do miracles even exist.. do good things even happen. is it even worth trying harder even with every inch and part of my soul being rippped and torned out.\n\ntoday i went to my emergancy hearing to get custody of my children due the abuse ongoing .\n\nwe got there my lawyer didn't show up on time we couldn't find her. \nwhen we did we notice my ex wife and her whole family and they were mocking me even the abuse that was occurring the man that was doing the abuse in which I got like video fucking evidence of the abuse and all aligations being made like hard proof evidence. and she still brought her husband which was the one abusing the children....\n\nanyways skip to the hearing I get to the stand I realize the evidence the so called paper work was printed off in black and white guess what the fucking bruises are in black and white no color guess who looks likena dipshit i was told not to bring my phone i was made a mockery out of than my ex got caught lying on the stand under oath 4 times... . \n\nshe gets caught lying alot in all honesty like true narcissists behaviors.. her family sat out the courtroom with pda and talking shit and just being horrible examples yet we're bad right ??\n\nanyways the pictures were in black and white because someone fucked up our paper work than her attorney mocked me for it cheap divorce attorney plus he used to be a comedian he couldn't make it so now he's a cheap uncontested divorce lawyer but hey he got to still mock me about the photos in which the bruises are so visible that you can see the large black pixels over the gray black pixels anyone in tech and anyways who understands this will get it but I made that point when asked when he tried to mock me and than the dipshit said I object to his own question like wtf !!??? \n\nthe judge told him he was fed up with his act in court and he was fixing to be thrown out..\n\nbut anyways here's where I'm broken this is what ripped me out.. her attorney brought up a proposal something that was already spoken and agreed apon since it was an emergency hearing.. for me to get supervised visits... guess who the supervisor is for me... my fucking MOM the one who caused all my fucking truama to me the one who disowns me than gets scared im going to take her visits away because she is toxic and i wanted to choose peace over violence but nope my mom my fucking mom guys ... . \n\nanyways fast forward to a witness like tf ?? \n\nit was the director of the new daycare that the children are at now oh wait you said you were friends with the defendant on Facebook oh wait she was your employee but you came here to say bad things about the father yetttt... you look strunged out but it gets better you said you know now when a bruise is bad enough to report it you don't know the answer to that question being a child care director of a daycare... wait it Gera better she said i was acting odd due the situation which was that I picked my children up last week to find out there was a dhs case open from them there mom didn't tell me didn't do nothing she has done so much damage to my life already ... I was never told where to drop them off or that she switched daycares due to the dhs case which looked bad on her in court anyways. . why am I complaining should be happy but she was asked if she would be surprised if that weird behavior she tried talking crap about after meeting me that if she considered that I have autism Than got asked if she thought anyone else or children had the same odd behavior she said yes than goes did you know Riley has autism she said umm yeah I think so. Than yeah she said she was friends with her on fb but before that get this..\n\nMy ex like I said lied on the stand said she never had any social media and never contacted anyone at the daycare she got caught ... lol..\n\nanyways yeah... this shits fucked ..\n\nI'm fucking alone in this world I'm in a state with no family no friends no fucking one and now I guess what won partial custody !!! I get them every other week for the full week I still pay full child support cuz someone forgot to bring that up but yeah I feel like I wasted money In a winning battle with fucking incompetent lawyers I try and try to do the right thing and than cuz I'm autistic and have all this talent so bam can't utilize my skills to make money but I'm in a place where I make good money but at the same time im drowning financial because I had to use everything to move states buy a new car suitable for children giving up my car I saved years for .. than geting a house in 2 days with this economy switching jobs I did that alone while moving furniture by myself no family no friends no one to help me carry 2000 pounds of shit. I went to work BTW I was 220 !! this was In march 2023. anyways I worked 276 hours at one point I worked a 30 hour shift straight .... \nI'm 165 now ... how did I lose that much weight ...

    "postText": "My boyfriend \"S\" (22/M) and I (20/F) have been dating for just over a month. This relationship has been different from any others I have been in. He is very much an extrovert, he has many friends and is almost always hanging around other people. I am an introvert with a small group of friends that I occasionally hangout with. \n  I often join S and his friends when they hangout and I've started becoming more comfortable around his main group. Recently something happened when me, him, and one of his friends were playing a horror game. His friend was leading us around and we ended up at a dead end. I made the comment \"good job\" as a joke and didn't mean anything by it. The comment was something I would say to anyone and honestly his friend didn't seem upset by it and actually laughed at the comment so I didn't think I had done anything wrong. My boyfriend got defensive and messaged me saying to not say that to his friend. After that I wasn't in the best mood so I just kind of went quiet and ended up just leaving and letting them play. \n     When me and my boyfriend we're alone later and watching videos before sleeping he said we needed to talk. He said I shouldn't be talking to his friends that way and he doesn't know why I always have an \"attitude\" around them. He said that he was tired of always apologizing for my actions and he's tempted to just stop inviting me when he's with them. I asked him if his friend had said he was upset by the comment but my bf said he didn't say anything. I also asked if any of his other friends had been upset by anything I said and he again said no but that he didn't like the way I talked to them. \n     The conversation ended after that and he ended up falling asleep. I couldn't sleep so I stayed until he woke up and then left. Now that I've had time to think I've realized something. \n     People always like me until I open up and stop watching everything I say. I have no problem making friends but people stop talking to me because of how I act. So I guess I'm just rude and annoying. He proved to me that people like the masked version of me not the real me. And that I'm only fun to be around when I'm quiet, nice, and \"cute\" \n Sorry, I know this is long but I just felt like I needed to say somewhere outside of my head. But I guess I'll just have to leave the mask on forever :)",

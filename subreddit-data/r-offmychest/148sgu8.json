    "postText": "The only time my friend reaches out is if he needs money. He has other friends closer by and they smoke weed together and are all rappers. \n\nThe majority of me doesn't care. Sure, part of me feels used and a little sad that I'm not really a priority, but I have other friends that prioritize me. \n\nSo, I guess I'm ok but partially complaining here. I'm never getting that money back, even if he lands on his feet somehow. \n\nI should be kicking myself for helping out so much and not saying no. But at the end of the day, I'm just glad to be able to help someone I care about.",

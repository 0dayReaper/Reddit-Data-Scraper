    "postText": "My boyfriend has been struggling with his career and health near the end of our breakup which was partial cause as to why he ended it. The other part was was we had some small incompatibilities that could have been worked out if he gave it more effort (I did and he acknowledged that). He told me he was unable to fix and work on himself while being with me and I was tired and drained of being the only one trying to fix things because he wasn\u2019t capable of it at the moment. I however, never complained and supported him the whole way through while giving him the space he needed when it was necessary. We weren\u2019t perfect but I truly believe we could have worked out.\n\nThe break up:\n\nI was over at his place that night and in the morning he woke up, turned to me and told me he doesn\u2019t think he can do this anymore. I told him I understood, it was hard not to beg but I\u2019ve done that before and it clearly didn\u2019t work out. We talked for 2 hours before I left his place, reminiscing the past, crying, laughing, apologizing etc. it was a rollercoaster but we weren\u2019t mad at each other, it was so civil. He told me not to hate him, he told me he wished this could\u2019ve worked out, he said it hurts him how he\u2019s treated me, he said he saw all the effort I put in and how maybe someday when the time is right maybe our paths will cross again. \n\nI told him I still have his stuff at my house and asked him how he wants to go about it. He made me promise that I would personally give him his things and not just drop them at the door or have someone else give them to him. I agreed but I told him I would just need some time before I see him again. He told me that he has to block my instagram because if not, he will just keep looking at it. Then he hugged me and kissed my face all over and told me he loves me so much and I left. God this is the worst heartbreak I have ever experienced, I wish I hated him.\n\nFinal: \n\nnow it\u2019s been 3 days and we haven\u2019t talked at all. I can\u2019t stop thinking about him and how kind he was to me when breaking up. I\u2019m just wishing he would reach out to me and tell me that he made a mistake by letting me go\u2026",

I feel like I\u2019m being strangled by my own Fallopian tubes. I want all of them to feel pain and suffering. I wish nothing but misery on anyone celebrating the overturn of Roe v. Wade. I can\u2019t wait to move. And fuck anyone who says, \u201cbUt YoUr NaTiOnAl PrIdE! It\u2019S wOrSe OtHeR pLaCeS.\u201d Fuck you, too.\n\nEdit: \n\nTo those of you who offered support: thank you so much. I am reading through and you have given me hope!\n\nTo those who suggest I move or die: I\u2019m trying. Believe me. Enjoy the brain drain that is inevitable. Have the life you\u2019ve earned. I hope your mothers, sisters, daughters, wives, etc see the hatred you are spewing and realize you would rather have your dick wet than them safe!\n\n[This](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Women%27s_Liberation_Movement) is my suggestion: all women and people with uteruses should just\u2026 stop. Everything. No cleaning, no cooking, no child rearing, no job, etc. If someone says it \u201cdoesn\u2019t affect\u201d them, **MAKE IT**. Definitely sex/dating strike.",

Even if your state allows abortion and even if that same state has legal protection for those providing abortions, other states may not. A provider who performs abortions might not be able to travel outside the state without risking being arrested. And a pregnant person going to another state may experience a miscarriage and end up like that poor tourist in Malta. The US is a country of states. One should not have to consider if it\u2019s safe to travel domestically, or how to move around the country. So while you may be in a safe state, the way people in that state interact with others may change dramatically with this ruling. Your boyfriend may say \u201cwell, don\u2019t travel while pregnant and you\u2019re not a provider so you\u2019re fine\u201d but that\u2019s still highly limiting compared to how the country worked only yesterday. Also, according to the scotus, this is only the beginning. Same sex marriage, contraceptives, womens right to vote, minority rights\u2026. How long can one really say that \u201coh, it doesn\u2019t affect me directly so it\u2019s ok?\u201d",

He said that while he doesn't personally agree with abortion, he doesn't think that should preclude others from getting one and it's none of his, or the government's business if they do. He's concerned about the precedent this will set going forward about how involved government is going to be in people's personal lives.\n\nSo I guess even some of the ones you wouldn't expect do care, not always in the way you'd want them to but some of them seem to be able to see the forest so to speak.\n\nI personally haven't felt this disgusted in a while and that's saying something with everything we've gone thru as a nation the past couple years. I'm afraid as a white woman who, while not 100% straight, married a man... but I'm terrified for bipoc and lgbtq communities. I can only know what it's like to be hated, looked down on, and treated as inferior because I'm a woman, I can't imagine adding in skin color and/or my choice of spouse. \n\nI'm so sorry everyone, this is a dark day for humanity and I'm just shattered, but I'm also afraid of what else is coming, and the men will care then, but it will be far too late by the time they wake up.",

Then you also combine that with the fact that Dems constantly go around saying they want a strong Republican party and how it's good for the US. Meanwhile, the leader of the GOP basically steals a supreme court justice and RBG decides to not retire, so you end up with this perfect storm of shitbaggery that's not at all representative of what most Americans believe.\n\nEither way, as mentioned this shit has been a long time coming.

This is completely bad for women's health and I've heard other people talk about this and it's clear that the Supreme Court either didn't think through all the complications it would cause or they just simply didn't care. \"It's all about saving lives!\" Yeah, bullshit! What exactly are doing to ensure women's health of they can't give birth safely? what you goings to provide to women who can't afford to keep their children? What are you doing for women who can't physically or emotionally handle birth? This is so obviously misogyny and the fact that they're not even trying to hide it baffles me! If these dipshits honestly think that the American people will take this lying down, then these so called \"American patriots\" don't know the first thing about our own history.",

    "postText": "So, I (23F) bought my own farm last September.  Over the winter was hard as I had a lot of unexpected bills. Well financial stress aside as I'm catching back up on things... my pets/rescues are driving me up the wall. I have 2 semi feral cats that no matter how much they're fed they constantly get into MY food, opening cabinets and my pantry just to eat bread,  chips,  tortillas uncooked pasta... I've had to throw away so much food cause it ends up being unsalvagable. Then my Herding dog has been tearing expensive things apart, and I can't afford to replace the things.  I'm just fed up with them.. and it makes me feel like a bad pet owner...",

    "postText": "I got out of a really bad marriage where my then-husband snuck around on his phone constantly. After three years of that treatment I\u2019m still working to trust others again. Yesterday my current boyfriend and I were at uHaul and he needed to grab something but wanted to keep his phone unlocked because it had the sign in pulled up. He just handed it to me without thinking anything of it but I\u2019m over the moon that he trusts me and I can trust him to be open about everything on his phone.",

Act like you grasp that, or be quiet.",

Anyway, he went to the gym in our apartment complex and left his phone at home.  I could have gone through it just for the hell of it. But the fact I wasn\u2019t even tempted to snoop told me all i needed to know about our relationship. \n\nSo glad you\u2019ve found someone who\u2019s helping you rebuild trust! \u2764\ufe0f",

I thought she was doing well in sobriety. Guess not lol.\n\nI'll never trust anyone with personal info like that again. I know people aren't usually like that, and yeah she was an addict, but if she didn't know my pin, maybe she wouldn't have stolen my card, withdrew money from an atm, and relapse.\n\nThe pros of not trusting someone with your personal shit very much outweighs the cons. Best case scenario, they trust you a little bit more, which if you aren't doing anything wrong, shouldn't even matter. Worst case, you wake up with with no cash and no pants.\n\nNever sacrifice your privacy for trust. That applies for anything. GPS trackers on your phone, keys to your mailbox, phone lock code, email password, bank account info, etc. That shit is YOURS until married, and *you* becomes *us* legally. At least in my opinion. \n\nBut maybe I'm jaded :/ fuckin meth.",

So after this was discovered we had a long chat about being open books to eachother. I have a screen lock also on my phone but it there because I don't need my son on my phone. She has the key and password anyways I have nothing to hide. Now since that talk I don't think alot has changed, she says she doesn't talk to that individual and deleted him off the snapchat app. So fast forward about 4 weeks, she goes out for a ladies night..cool. Drives home stupid drunk, not cool.. comes in the house puking sick. After all this a lady friend of hers messages and she's asks me to read it for her, I am assuming she would see an earlier message, talking about a guy her and her lady friend would like to threesome with...uh, am I missing some obvious signs here?? I screenshot the message and sent it to my phone so I could ask her about it in the morning when not super intoxicated. These are things, even if I was interested in thinking about that I would not talk to my friends about. I am not sure what to do next..now all of a sudden I am insecure! Why yes I am and she says well it's not attractive..well maby don't be a tramp when intoxicated?? Anyone got advice?? Legit advice? Counselling?? Not sure where to go from here\ud83e\udd14",

At one point we went out to a shitty fast food place and grabbed food and brought it back home. At some point during the meal she asked if she could have some fries and I just kind of handed them over and said sure. Honestly I was actually pretty nervous (one of the first dates alone together) and I probably couldn't have eaten them anyway. Afterwards she was near tears telling me she couldn't believe that I gave her the fries. We've since broke up but we still talk from time to time. To this day she still brings up the fries story and mentions how much it meant to her. I guess it just goes to show how little acts of kindness can affect someone.",

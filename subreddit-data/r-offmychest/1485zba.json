I\u2019m so upset, I feel like I\u2019m missing out on that part of life! All my friends have had boyfriends before, and it makes me so sad that I can\u2019t get anyone to like me. I\u2019ve heard heaps of guys say I look too small and I don\u2019t look 18 so that\u2019s why they\u2019ve rejected me.  How can I change that? \ud83d\ude14",

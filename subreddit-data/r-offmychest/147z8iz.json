    "postText": "I\u2019ve been looking for work since right before Christmas. Everyone seems to have great things to say about my resume (and sometimes cover letter if applicable), I get a decent number of interviews, and they seem to go well. But I always seem to be the runner-up. I don\u2019t get where I am going wrong. They could at least give me a Miss Congeniality sash for my efforts. \n\nThe past few weeks, I had a job interview process for a role that would have been great. Stellar company, suited to my skills, wonderful. I never, ever assume I got the job, ever. In general, I don\u2019t believe it until I\u2019m actually working in the role. I\u2019ve been burned too many times. But yeah\u2026 they liked me, but I didn\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t know why because I KNEW this was a possibility. I\u2019m not naive. But I\u2019m still devastated.\n\nI feel so worthless. Objectively, I\u2019m a really good worker with great skills. But no one seems to see it. \n\nI don\u2019t want any advice, please. I get too much advice already from all corners and very little of it is helpful.  I just want to cry.",

If you want, I can share the prompts I wrote to help me better match my skills and resume to the job description. Then I would only apply to the top jobs that chat gbt ranked as the best suitable for me. (I can share in the morning, I am writing through my insomnia).",

    "postText": "I  (F18) am on the verge of a mental breakdown. My family of four lives on Long Island, which is well known as an expensive place to live. 10 years ago we got lucky &amp; found the place we currently rent. Our landlord is a very kind lady but her husband is the problem. He controls all of the decisions of the house including rent, &amp; he has been fighting with her on raising the rent for the past couple of months. \n\nI have only met this man only a handful of times since we moved here. He doesn\u2019t care for us like she does, she\u2019s the one who has been present in our lives &amp; who we\u2019ve built a personal relationship with. But he wants us out, asap. Luxury apartments are being built all around town, he wants to raise us to market price. But yet we\u2019re the ones who have been maintaining the house ( fencing, cesspool issues, new dryers, new flooring, etc..) He has only helped once with the bathroom, &amp; it was a poor job done cheaply at the expense of our comfort. \n\nMy parents are almost 50, they\u2019re hardworking immigrants who have been working since they were 6 years old. I will finally be leaving to college at the end of the month after taking a gap year, I\u2019ve stayed home to help them with utilities &amp; care for them. \n\nBut now we will have to start paying almost $3k, it\u2019s unfair for them &amp; now I\u2019m worried as to what I can do to help. Rent is expensive on Long Island, even NY in general. &amp; buying a house is out of the question. I\u2019m in tears thinking about how I could help them, should I take another year off school? \n\nI just needed to rant, even if no one will read this. I can\u2019t burden my friends with this as this is about my parents.",

    "postText": "Hi, I feel like the worst girlfriend ever :( We\u2019re both 20s. She had short dark hair when we met, I wore wigs. What makes this worse is over the duration of our relationship I changed my hair up immensely. Stopped wearing wigs, started styling my natural hair completely differently, dyed my hair an array of rainbow colours and each time she\u2019s told me I\u2019m beautiful with them. Yet the last time I bleached mine she also wanted to do hers. Hers doesn\u2019t take to bleaching as readily as mine so it mostly just turned out a rusty orange colour on hers. She wanted to get to platinum like me but didn\u2019t bother with bleaching it further. I have to admit, I don\u2019t think it looked the best :( But I held my tongue and said nothing and supported her.\n\nNow she has bright pink hair and\u2026 I just can\u2019t help but look back at pictures of us this time last year, with her dark hair, and think of how much more attracted I was to her at that time than I am now. I know I can\u2019t tell her any of this as it\u2019s such a horrible thing of me to think when I\u2019ve changed so much and she\u2019s loved me the same throughout. I would never stop her from changing her colour or ask her not to. But I just feel like an awful partner for not feeling as attracted to her as I used to.",

If you don\u2019t like it you don\u2019t like it, you can\u2019t control that but what\u2019s important is you aren\u2019t doing anything hurtful to her because of it, and you recognize that it\u2019s not exactly fair. When she decides to change it again if she asks for your opinion you can suggest she goes back to dark but who knows, you may grow to like how it is now if you keep an open mind",

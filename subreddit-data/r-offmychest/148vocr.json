    "postText": "\nSo I have heart failure and am working on trying to get a heart transplant. I recently moved out of my abusive moms into my dads- and it hasn\u2019t gone good. I do cardiac rehab 3x a week Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. \n\nThis all started on Tuesday. I came home from hanging out with my brother and my dad asked me if tomorrow morning I could help the kids (I live with a 5, 8 and 12 year old) mop the floor. We have a swiffer. I agreed and went on with my day. I went to bed as usual and woke up at 9:30 am and went out to help. The 12 year old had the 5 and 8 year old help clean and they finished all of it. I asked if there was anything I could do or help out with. They said no so I went back to bed. I went to cardiac rehab the same day. And when I got home my dad scolded me for not helping them cleans he acknowledged it wasn\u2019t entirely my fault but scolded me. He told me in return to clean the bathroom. I had felt awful from rehab and I told him I physically couldn\u2019t do it. He said he wanted it done anyway. Even if I have to mop, take a break, etc, so I didn\u2019t argue and I went to rest. I slept until 10 and woke up, knowing I still had to clean the bathroom or else my dad would get mad. I got up and I cleaned. I still felt awful, and as I know my bodies limits o was right, I pushed myself too far. And I felt awful after cleaning, and ended up vomiting at 1am. \n\nThe next day I had cardiac rehab again and I physically couldn\u2019t do it my oxygen was also at 68% I told them what had happened and I had to sit on oxygen for an hour. They then called my doctors and I went on with my day \n\nFriday comes around and my doctors call me to clarify to me what had happened, before calling my dad my dad seemed understanding over the phone but as soon as he hung up he complained saying. \u201cI only made her tidy I barley made her do anything, what she did wasn\u2019t that hard\u201d stuff like that. \n\nHe then also scolded me later on for \u2018running my mouth to my doctors\u2019 \n\nMonday rolls around and I talk to my cardiac rehab team with my grandpa and they decide to call CPS on my dad. There\u2019s also been other instances. For example I had been bloated and swelled from steroids I had to take due to an infection I had. My dad told me not to go to cardiac rehab while bloated because \u201ccardiac rehab will call your doctors and you doctors will female dog at me\u201d \n\nAnother example is I had trash pile up due to me being sick. When I finally took it out my dad said \u201csee that wasn\u2019t that hard,  it\u2019s not hard to take trash out\u201d I explained it may be easy for him but for me it\u2019s 10x harder because I\u2019m disabled he simply responded \u201cit\u2019s not that hard\u201d \n\nHe also is constantly telling me \u201cI have it easy, he gives more shit to the other kids , I do the bare minimum\u201d and more like that \n\nWell CPS now had an active case and my dad isn\u2019t very happy he\u2019s telling me I cannot talk to my doctors alone, my grandma has to be in the room at all times so no more private convos and even worse he\u2019s telling me \u201cyou\u2019re over exaggerating things, you could\u2019ve told me and I wouldn\u2019t of made you do it or told you to do it tomorrow (I told him I couldn\u2019t do it physically). You could\u2019ve just did it tomorrow I wouldn\u2019t of been mad, I\u2019ve never yelled at you you\u2019ve never gotten in trouble for something you couldn\u2019t do, your grandma has to be in there when you talk to CPS she can\u2019t leave you can either have a good summer or a bad summer depending on what you tell this lady, I never medically neglected you if you tell this lady an over exaggerated story, if you lie you\u2019ll be sent to a foster home, with strangers when I tried to explain to him what happened that day he got angry at me for supposedly \u201ctelling him he was lying\u201d and that he asked me to do it when I didn\u2019t have cardiac rehab and I did it on the day I did or that I did it the day after that (he asked me to do it the day I had cardiac rehab) he says I stay up all night and I woke up at 3am to do it (which isn\u2019t true) he\u2019s also been complaining about my doctors getting involved with CPS and this case \n\n\nI just feel so confused and hopeless maybe I\u2019m over exaggerating maybe I\u2019m a bad person or a bad daughter maybe I do have it good and I\u2019m just over exaggerating in scared I\u2019m confused I\u2019m lost I don\u2019t know what to do I also feel like I\u2019m being manipulated but I can\u2019t talk to anyone because all of my family kisses his butt I\u2019m just lost and scared",

Maybe dad can come with you to your cardiac appointments just to listen in, hear what the doctors have to say while observing you through rehab visit. It might put things in better perspective as far as what you are and aren\u2019t capable of doing.",

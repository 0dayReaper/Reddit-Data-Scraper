    "postText": "i can\u2019t tell my friends bc they are all diehard marvel fans and i know they would kill me lol, but i didn\u2019t like the movie that much. \n\ni probably won\u2019t be able to put this into words well since i know it\u2019s heavily subjective, but the writing fell very flat for me. most of the humor was a bit painful it sit through, but i have that issue with all marvel movies. the humor just isn\u2019t for me. the movie felt like it was 3 hours long (even though it was just under 2) and it was just a trailer for the incoming third movie that will inevitably release. i just hate when movies can\u2019t wrap themselves up. if i want cliff hangers i\u2019ll just watch a TV show where i only have to wait a week (or less) for my questions to be answered. i feel like there were so many characters that they tried to cover that i don\u2019t really feel connected to anyone in particular, especially the newer people. \n\nand i will say i do feel like it\u2019s needed to introduce all these new characters, and i\u2019m glad we got to see more about gwen, but i just feel like it would be suited for a longer running TV show opposed to a movie format since it\u2019s decently complex \n\nfrom an animation and sound design standpoint is was incredible which almost made up for everything else tbh. also the character design was amazing. \n\n[note: i am in no means an expert and i don\u2019t AT ALL claim to have the correct opinion, so please don\u2019t attack me. i just needed to talk about it so i don\u2019t get exiled by my friends lol]",

    "postText": "I\u2019m sorry for the long post but there is a lot to this and I\u2019ve never told anyone this. I\u2019m just now coming to terms with what happened and I\u2019m terrified. \nI\u2019ve (23F) been dating the love of my life (21M) for a year now and he\u2019s the absolute love of my life and we have been seriously talking about getting engaged. I\u2019m so happy. \n\nBefore my current boyfriend, I dated a guy, we\u2019ll call him Matt(23M) on and off throughout high school and college. We had a toxic relationship with him emotionally and verbally abusing me for years. My friends stopped hanging out with me because I continued to date him, and I don\u2019t blame them. At the time, I thought the relationship was normal, and now I know it\u2019s not and the way he treated me was not okay. Long story short, he always kept our relationship a secret. I even went to senior prom with a different guy while he and I were dating and he went with another girl so that it would stay a secret. He never introduced me to his family or friends from other schools. In our 7 years of \u201cdating\u201d (i don\u2019t know what to call it anymore) I met his mom twice and his brother once. And that was it, despite him going to big family/friend dinners every week. He knew my entire extended family. He never let me post on social media or tell anyone about us. After a few years, he told me he wasn\u2019t one to be tied down and we should just be FWB. I stupidly went along with it because I was terrified to lose him. However after a year, I realized he would never come around. So I started dating. He of course got angry and jealous, and told me he wanted to try to make us work. I broke up with the guy and dated Matt. Two days later, back to FWB. This happened 4 times. Also he often used sex as manipulation tactics but that\u2019s another story. \nSo the last year we were \u201ctogether\u201d, I was working on myself and was slowly detaching myself from him. 8months later, I reconnected with an old family friend (my current bf) and we started hanging out. Our connection was instant and it was incredible. I immediately told Matt that I was done and there was no chance of us getting back together. He called me terrible names and laughed in my face and told me I\u2019d be back because \u201cno one could ever love me for long.\u201d \n\nA few weeks into my current relationship, Matt (who moved a few states away) kept calling and texting me asking for me back. I said no and that I was finally happy and this was the man I\u2019m going to marry. I knew that just a few weeks in. \nIn the middle of the night, Matt showed up at my doorstep with flowers. Crying. Begging to come inside. I told him no. I couldn\u2019t let myself go down that cycle again and especially now that I was so happy. \nHe left and went to a hotel. But the next night he called asking if he could come talk. I stupidly said okay. I was worried about him as I had never heard him cry and he was sobbing. \n\nHe came to my house and we talked and he cried and sobbed in my arms. I hugged him and told him he would be okay. He then said \u201cthere was something we never got to do\u201d and he asked me if he could eat me out. I said absolutely not and pushed him off of me. He told me \u201cyou know I could just rape you\u201d and laughed. I said I knew he wouldn\u2019t do that because he cared about me and he said that was true. He started crying again so I just sat by him, but had a very intense feeling of dread. He\u2019s someone who carries and he told me he had his gun in his bag when he came in. And I hadn\u2019t thought anything of it until that moment. I went cold and I was scared. He started begging me while crying to sit on his face and I said no and to please stop. Then he kissed me. I pushed him off and he said \u201ccome on you can\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t feel that spark.\u201d I said I didn\u2019t. And I really didn\u2019t. I felt scared. Then he pulled off my pants and I went numb. Completely frozen. I didn\u2019t fight him off and I hate myself for that. I told him no and I asked him not to but he just kept saying \u201cshhhh it\u2019s okay it\u2019s rape. I\u2019m raping you\u201d and he did oral while I cried and fingered me. I just laid there numb and crying. When he finally stopped, he asked if I liked it and I shook my head no and couldn\u2019t stop crying. He said \u201couch\u201d and asked if he should leave and if I was sure I was done because he wouldn\u2019t come back and it was my last chance. I asked him to leave and he did. We haven\u2019t spoken since. \n\nThat was about 11 months ago. \nI kind of blocked all of it out and have been trying to avoid thinking about it. I have so much guilt and shame and disgust. I know I should tell my bf and I should\u2019ve told him immediately but I couldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know how. I\u2019m scared I waited too long now and he\u2019ll leave me. He\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. \nWas this rape? Do I tell my bf? How? I don\u2019t know what to do. I haven\u2019t told anyone. \n\nTLDR: I think my ex SA me a month after my current bf and I started dating. I don\u2019t know how to tell him.",

            "comment": "This is a very long post, I\u2019m sorry, but I want you to know that you are loved and have nothing to be ashamed of. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. Sometimes people judge people for waiting so long to report or tell anyone, but I took 18 years to come forward about my own assault for a variety of reasons, including that I was in denial for much of that. You\u2019ve finally realized it after 11 months and I\u2019m proud of you for giving yourself that so much sooner than I could! That requires so much strength. \n\nThis is hard, but when you\u2019re ready you should tell you current boyfriend. Especially since you think this is the man you want to marry. If he is the right one, he will be hurt on behalf of you not mad at you. He should be mad at your rapist not at you. \n\nHere are some things to make sure you protect your current relationship when you do finally discuss it with him:\n\n1. You do not have to give details to your boyfriend. Or to anyone for that matter. This protects you from re-traumatizing yourself and protects him from being traumatized as well. A simple \u201ci was raped by my ex on [this date]. He threatened me and I felt unsafe. Ive been struggling with denial until now.\u201d Is enough information. If he asks for more, it\u2019s always okay to say you\u2019re not ready to rehash everything awful that happened. I don\u2019t share any details with anyone other than my therapist. My boyfriend knows it happened when I was 8/9 and what my mental health issues are as a result. But he knows I hurt when I think about it, so he only wanted to know enough to make sure I feel safe with him.\n\n2. Focus on how you\u2019re feeling. You probably blame yourself, you probably are justifying it\u2019s just oral not penetrative sex, etc. I had a therapist once have me write out all the justifications I was giving that were causing me to feel shame. Then she had me write on a new paper all the things adult me/current me would tell younger me to make her feel okay to come forward and to help see the shame is not hers, it\u2019s his. See if this activity would help you. Share these feelings if you\u2019re ready. Seek a therapist to help with navigating how you\u2019re feeling. They also have insight in how to navigate relationships after trauma.\n\n3. Tell your boyfriend whether or not you\u2019re ready to or want to press charges. I\u2019m always like \u201cyes always press charges, get that shit on paper somewhere.\u201d Yet here I stand still never having officially reported my abuse 25 years later. But it\u2019s important he\u2019s on the same page as you. If you don\u2019t want to go through with an investigation, you don\u2019t have to and he shouldn\u2019t force you to.\n\nITS UP TO YOU WHETHER OR NOT TO REPORT IT OR EVEN TELL ANYONE. But I also want you to know from decades of experience that this will continue to eat you up inside. It is not your shame to carry so please give yourself the peace of having someone on your side. Please seek therapy to help heal. It changed my life.",

            "comment": "Was this rape? Yes.  After 11 months would I tell your bf? Probably not.  Is it f\u2019ed up what you ex did to you? Absolutely. Is it your fault? No. But keep in mind you have a long and sordid sexual history with your ex. Letting him in your house was not the smartest thing to do, but again it\u2019s not your fault. I\u2019m sure from a guy\u2019s perspective that he fears your ex has some kind of hold over you. You\u2019ve certainly demonstrated that in the past.  Waiting 11 months to say anything may put doubt in his mind. Since your ex hadn\u2019t contacted you in a year, hopefully you are done with.  I would leave the past in the past.",

I only started thinking about this night recently because I suspect my bf is going to propose soon and my ex is just the type of person to try to ruin this for me. I\u2019m so in love with my boyfriend and I know he\u2019s the one. I\u2019m terrified of losing him. I f\u2019ed up not telling him sooner.",

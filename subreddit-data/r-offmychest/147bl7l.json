    "postText": "If suicide is triggering for you, please do not read. Sorry this is long. I don't have anyone to talk with. I am the one that everyone comes and talks to. Everyone. Family, and work and church.  I (52f) came home Saturday after leaving after a fight. I was tired and flew off and after begging my husband (64m) to try and talk he walked away and wouldn't look at me. So I left and told him via text that I was tired of doing all the work in our relationship (married 33y) and wasn't sure where we go from here. Went to town to go get a prescription and wasn't sure I wanted to come back. The prescription that I checked was in my purse was missing. It made me pause, like a sign,  and decided to come home. Walked in the door with the few things I had bought, and my husband hadn't heard me come in. He had the oddest look on his face. We started at each other. And then  he broke down and cried. Like really crying. And he handed me his phone with a draft text that was a suicide note. We talked. We talked a lot. I noticed he had cleared out his wallet of cash. (His dad recently died and it bothered my husband that it took so long to get the cash back). My husband said  he had been feeling this way for a long time. I have a long family history of depression and suicide, have taken mental health first aid courses and stuff (through work) and I missed ALL the signs. I went to the barn and took down the noose and the stool he had set up. Today son (30) asked about the \"weird call from Dad\" yesterday. He had also called our daughter (26). And I asked him today if he had been going to the barn when I walked in the door. If I had been minutes later, I would be a widow. Here is the thing. I am not sure I want to be married to THIS man. But I would want to be married to the man he could be if he wasn't ill. I see that man on good days. But I am not sure I am good for him. I make more and have been successful and he sees himself as a failure with little to show for his life (his words) and I think I could do more to support him? But I would never leave him while he is dealing with this, and yes it may be years or till the end of this life (he is diabetic and has a lot of complications). I am almost...glad?? That this has come out, because now we can maybe have some change? I am trying to get him to reach out to a few different sources. He says he is still to \"raw\".  I am beside myself with how close it was. Like, minutes were the difference between life and death. And I am gutted by how close it was. I feel like I can't breathe. I need to get straight to I can help him.\n\nUpdate: thank you everyone for your replies and support . Your comments have helped me feel I was not alone and even reminded that I did have a therapist that I can reach out to. We are talking and evaluating options, details in various replies. Your comments have helped more than you know. I hope this doesn't blow up more - He does listen to those read reddit post things so to those creators, please don't.",

They can help get support systems/resources in place, as well as speak to psychiatrists to get meds on board (if they feel it\u2019s necessary). It also gives him a break to focus on himself, and you a little time to breathe and cope with your emotions. He would likely have to go voluntarily admit himself, but it might be a really good place to start. Good luck to you both! I hope you are able to make changes so you both find peace, happiness, and hope through all of this.",

He\u2019s the same person, just dealing with a deep sense of sadness, or maybe even hopelessness. It\u2019s okay to feel scared or confused about what you\u2019re seeing. But I know that for me, a big part of healing was finding people who could support me even while I was feeling that incredible darkness. Being cared for genuinely and unwaveringly helped me realize that things could get better. \n\nDo you know of anyone who could be a support system for your husband? Anyone who could be a support system for you? I wish you both so much healing.",

I had to go to a psychiatric hospital for about a week after both attempts and I found them to be extremely helpful. The first ward was underfunded and kind of stressful, but they kept me safe. The second hospital was much better. After I was considered to no longer be an immediate threat to myself I was able to go home, but I decided to do the outpatient treatment for several weeks. I really liked having somewhere to go during the day where I felt like I was actively working on \u2018getting better\u2019. The best part though, was how much relief I felt being surrounded by people who also felt like the worst person in the world. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this with your family and I wish you all the best. Please take care &lt;3",

Separately and together. \n\nI believe mental health resources for your hubby and some therapy for yourself after walking into that would be a very positive step in the right direction. And couples counseling should be a thing to look into. \n\nIn your post you state you don't want to be with the man you see before you today, but want the man you catch glimpses of, the man you married, hopefully some couples therapy can put you both on the track to finding this man, along with his own personal therapy and help for his mental illness. \n\nDon't take it on yourself and never feel bad you didn't see the signs. Those that truly get to the point of no return don't outwardly show signs. It's usually the ones crying out for help but dint know how to ask that show the signs before they try to do what your husband done. \n\nI lost my auntie to suicide. 3 hours before she done it we were sitting planning days out in the future, painting our nails, eating Chinese food and deciding which member of boyzone we'd love to have a night with. I didn't have a clue. \n\nI wish you both the best for the future. The road to recovery is going to be long, but don't forget you need to reach out to people too. All those that trauma dump on you. Open up once in a while. Go to an empty field and scream into nothing. Just do anything to let it out. \n\nGood luck and virtual hugs to you both.",

It is very important that he receives help from professional sources. If at any time you are truly concerned then don't be afraid to take him to the local emergency room. I understand you have decided against this for now. If you do change your mind, please understand the mental health professionals in the hospital can make the determination on whether he needs go to a psychiatric ward. If so, then they can have the discussion with him and work out a plan. What I'm advocating is that you don't need to make these decisions on your own.   \n\nThis is not something that your husband and you need to take on alone.\n\nAlso, please look after yourself. I work in the mental health field and recognise the pain that loved ones go through, when it comes to their loved one's mental health. Loved  ones can feel a great sense of self-blame and guilt. It's good to hear you have a therapist to talk to.\n\nThe road to recovery is not an easy one. But with the right help, people can recover and go on to a fulfilled, blessed life. Of course, recovery is not a cure. But, with a lot of love and support, hopefully your husband will find the avenue to recover that suits him.\n\nI wish you both the best.",

In my country they are for patients who have things like so severe disorders they never are able to take care of themselves, you don\u2019t get involuntary held for a suicide attempt. If you voluntary want help that\u2019s different. But it would not be in some facility but theraphy while living at home. \n\nBut I live in a country where healthcare doesn\u2019t cost much but is government paid. So that\u2019s why there might be higher standards for care. I assume if you are from a US it\u2019s more like finding a company you pay for to get care? But involuntary still sounds like a lot for a suicide. Usually taking away someone\u2019s rights like that is a big deal in most countries, including US.\n\nAnd why was op downvoted for telling what the case is in her country.",

To clarify, not that I should have to, but to those other commentators, here to commit someone involuntarily you have to have a specific form which is notoriously hard to get. Because he told me what his plans were and agreed he would not go forward, he would no longer meet the definition of \"likely to cause harm\". I went through all of this with my daughter. This is how I know. I also know because of work requirements, re the \"paygrade\" comment   Here, you pretty much have to be in the midst of a psychotic break before emergency will involuntarily admit. We also have medically assisted suicide here that, very controversially, allows for mental health as an allowable reason. So no, my Husband made the decision to not go that route. He is still a grown man capable of making decisions under the laws of this country.",

So I actually checked myself into mental hospitals 14 times over the course of 5 years by simply telling them I felt like hurting myself. \n(And even though I checked myself in they would always end up being categorized as involuntary stays anyway for some regulatory reason.)\nSometimes I was low income in which case the hospital stays were free. Other times I had insurance so the stays were a hundred dollars a day. (The average stay for Suicide ideation in my state [California] is 3-7 days). And while that can definitely be a lot, it is still worth it to save a human life or at the very least cheaper than a funeral to put it in the most cynical way. \n\nIt\u2019s wild to me that other countries don\u2019t take suicide ideation as seriously. I\u2019m only alive and well today because luckily my country does. (One of the very few things we do well, I guess).",

And for the last 4 years, my aunt and son-in-law lived with her. My aunt helped her grandma: she cooked food, clean, washed clothes, and so on. however, she showed displeasure when her grandma sometimes caused problems due to her old age. A few months ago, my grandma quarreled with them, as the son-in-law stopped greeting her when he arrived at her apartment. As a result of the quarrel, they moved out of there. Since then, my mother began to come to my grandma to feed her, clean, wash things. After a few weeks, my grandma began to leave the apartment, wander around the city. Therefore, so that grandma would not get lost again, mother first began to close the front door so that grandma could not leave the apartment. So until today, my mother came to her in the morning and in the afternoon every day to feed and do other necessary things. Today my mother had a morning appointment with the doctor and she did not come to her mother in the morning. Then she learned that her grandma had jumped out of the window. She died a few hours later in intensive care.",

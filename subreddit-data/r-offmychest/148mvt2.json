    "postText": "\r  \nAfter being married for over 10 years, I now understand why men choose to spend so much time at work.  This is the cycle that I've seen in my own marriage:\r  \n\r  \n1.  I do something at home that needs to be done.  My wife sees what I do and says to me, \"Why did you do this?  This is wrong.  Why didn't you do this instead?\"  This implies that I should have known of this \"better\" way of doing the thing, but I didn't.  OK, cool.  I won't fight that.  She obviously knows better than me in these situations.  That means I can look to her as a resource so that I can make better choices next time.  Awesome.  I'll refer to her next time until I start to do things correctly consistently and then I'll be good.\r  \n\r  \n2.  I ask her for input while making a decision or doing something.  This results in \"adding to her mental load\" (as she put it) and complains that asking for her input is harder on her because she has to stop, focus on me, help me, and then go back to doing what she was doing.  OK, that's fair.  I don't want to stress her out even more and add burden to her; I want to lighten her burden and be a help.  If doing things on my own adds to her burden, and asking her for input adds to her burden, then I'll just wait until she asks me to do something.  I'm happy to help out and do whatever I'm asked.\r  \n\r  \n3.  I wait to be asked to do something.  This results in her seeing me be lazy because I'm not doing anything of my own initiative.  She complains to me that I'm not doing anything, that she's the only one that does anything around the house or for the family.  She wants me to do more.  OK, that's fair.  Then when I see something that needs to be done, then I'll go do it.... but wait.... I remember what happened when I did that.  That was step 1.  Now what?\r  \n\r  \n4.  I leave for work.  During work I take care of things, get things done, am told thank you and well done by my boss and peers.  If I mess something up, I'm able to correct it and learn from it and get better.  I'm able to contribute to my work in a positive way.  I feel great.  Then it's time for me to go home and I hesitate and I wonder why I feel this way.  Then I think of the cycle above.\r  \n\r  \nIt could be anything from planning a family vacation (\"Why did you pick this hotel?  Didn't you think of this?  Why didn't you choose this instead?\")  To loading the dishwasher (\"You put the bowls in wrong.  The plates are in the wrong spot.  That's not how the silverware goes.\")  Just today I asked her \"What do you think about getting a rug for the top of the stairs?\"  The response I got was \"If you've thought about this for a while and you know its a bad idea, why are you asking me?\"\r  \n\r  \nMy wife wants me to see things how she does, think how she does, do what she does the way she does it before she does it herself so that she doesn't have to do it.  \r  \n\r  \nAnd she blames me for her disappointment.  \r  \n\r  \nI don't know if all women are like this, but if they are, you women needs to wake up and smell the coffee.",

During work I take care of things, get things done, am told thank you and well done by my boss and peers. **If I mess something up, I'm able to correct it and learn from it and get better.**\n\nIf you go back to step 1, your wife is also providing you feedback so that you're able to correct it, learn from it, and get better. If you messed something up at work, would you proceed to step 2 or would you learn how to fix things on your own so that you wouldn't always need to refer to your manager in the future? Wouldn't your manager also find it annoying to always be helping you with every little thing (i.e. adding to their mental load)?\n\nYou imply this is some logical succession but you're missing so many possible branches to this decision tree. Why not branch from step 1 to step 1a where you learn from your wife about her preferences and then get better? The same skill you're using at work to get kudos will also work at home.\n\nI'd start self-reflecting and wonder why you don't want to learn from your wife in the same way you learn from someone at work, and why you don't prioritize things that are important to her in the same way you prioritize tasks at work.",

Do you know where everything is kept and how it is kept in the house? If you don't, why not? \n\n2. Do you know what your children's schedules are and how to take care of them solo? If you don't, why not?\n\n3. Do you practice clear judgement that is long term and strategic focused instead of short term? \n\n4. Do you communicate with each other as a discussion or do you wait to be led?\n\nAnd most importantly, does she know how the way she speaks to you makes you feel?\n\nI can tell you that your wife wants you to pick up things independently, considering all relevant angles to your family's needs and make decisions that prioritise your family.\n\nNext time she has feedback for you, ask her why and take note, so she doesn't have to tell you again.

If you're worried about stepping on your wife's toes, just talk to her! Maybe there are chores that she'd prefer to do for whatever reason (i.e. a specific way that she does her laundry) and then ones that might be better suited for you. \n\nHonestly, your post is very whiny. It seems like you need perpetual praise for doing the bare minimum, but I bet your wife rarely receives a thank you for keeping the family running. I also found it odd that you don't know where your own dishes or utensils go\u2014\u00a0but here's your opportunity to learn from the mistake and do better! \n\nMaybe weekly family management meetings would help so that the two of you could make a plan for the week and divide up responsibilities? Seeing a therapist to talk some of this out wouldn't be a bad idea because they'd be able to set you up with the tools to communicate better.",

At that point I realized there were definitely other hills to die on. Like never cleaning his hair up off the sink after shaving, and I gave up on the towels and tried to be thankful. Also he hates how I organize the dishwasher so he insists on doing that himself. We both came in with expectations that we had to sort out, but we only did it through having conversations.",

The thing is, this kind of nonsense is exceedingly common, as is seeing women queue up to say it's the man's fault she's pulling BS like saying it adds to her burden to simply tell him how she'd like something to be done. I mean WTF hubby, you're not even a mind reader? That's \"weaponized incompetence.\" Put in some effort, dude. \n\nHere's how this works at my house. I do something. My wife says \"great, thanks.\"\n\nSometimes she'll say something like \"could you put the plates in the cabinet this way next time?\" I say sure, no problem. I don't really care how the plates go in there, so it doesn't matter to me unless she's asking for something that would make it a lot more work. \n\nOnce in a blue moon she'll say something like \"that's not right at all.\" I'll say \"oh, what's wrong with it?\" She'll say whatever is on her mind. Here's where it gets interesting. If she brings up something that makes sense and would actually improve the result, I say ok, I'll do it that way next time. If it's something that's clearly just a preference, I say \"oh, do you want to do it yourself next time?\" \n\nOn the really rare occasions when she come comes back with something snarky like \"if you can't see it, I'm not going to tell you,\" I don't even ask, I just say \"I see, well, you can do it yourself next time since the right way is apparently some kind of closely guarded secret.\" \n\nWe've been married for over 30 years now, and probably haven't had a fight about chores in 25 years. She knows I'll take direction if I think it's valid and helpful. She also knows I won't put up with BS game playing.",

Because he did the thing. If he needs to ask me how to do something, telling him how is still not impacting my mental load as having to do it myself, plus now in the future he's already been taught how, so that's also taking from my load.  \n\nBeing upset because someone does something in a way I wouldn't have, yet being unwilling to tell/show them how I'd like it done just seems silly to me..",

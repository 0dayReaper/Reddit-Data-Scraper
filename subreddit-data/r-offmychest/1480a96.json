    "postText": "I think I'm prepared to do it but my main concern is my single mother who has cared for me and risk her going crazy from bereavement.\n\nBefore you tell me to consider the effects it may have on others consider my position:\n\n* I have put my mental health needs and suicidal thoughts due to being afraid of upsetting others or being seen as less of a man.(I've held for three years now I'm weak,what a fuckin joke)\n* I realised no one would genuinely miss me if I'm gone.(Not that it matters look at the state of our narcissistic and morally corrupt world)\n* I face insane pressure as the eldest son and academic pressure from college that is making me want to kill myself.\n\nI'm seriously considering it,life goals seem distant and death seems like the perfect escape.\n\nI really hate how out of all the people I know no one cares.",

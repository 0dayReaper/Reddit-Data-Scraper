    "postText": "i'm 16 and will have to go to college soon. whatever i decide to study next school year will really determine my future. i like learning, but it really saddens me that i'm not passionate about anything in particular.\n\nmy friends are all decided &amp; have had their dreams for a long time - A is studying programming, B is sure about astrophysiology, and D is about to enter college &amp; has plans to attend business school later on. meanwhile, i can only support them as i have no dreams to share.\n\nit also doesn't help that my relatives are all so matured &amp; determined. cousin A is in vet school, while cousin B who's a few months younger than me is on their way to getting a student pilot license. everyone is proud of them while nobody expects anything from me, i normally wouldn't mind but it does hurt when i see it in their eyes.\n\ni just feel so.. left out? i feel like i don't belong. i've been told that i wouldn't go far in life with my social anxiety &amp; lack of passion, and i'm really starting to believe it. i just wish i knew my purpose in life.",

Going to college without a plan is a quick way to land yourself in debt. \n\nWho told you you won\u2019t go far in life? They\u2019re wrong. \n\nIf I were you, I wouldn\u2019t go to college. If work and explore until I found my passion, which is exactly what I did. \n\nI dropped out of two colleges barking up the wrong tree and wasted tens of thousands. \n\nThen I went on a journey where I discovered I love working with autistic kids. Then I went back to school for occupational therapy and learned I wanted to work with neurotypical kids and adults. (Love autistic kids, can\u2019t stand their parents hindering their success) \n\nSo I changed my major to psychology and loved it so much I breezed through. Because I knew what I wanted to do, and I knew I needed certification to perform. \n\nThe best thing you can do now is try everything. What do you do in your spare time? What interests you and only you? It can be vague and unrelated to school but will help. \n\nSchool can sometimes expose you to different paths, but at what cost? \n\nSo what would you do if no one else existed on earth? What do you do in your spare time?",

Best advice I can give is to try things and when you have even an inkling of interest, delve into it. \n\nI can tell that you really care about what you typed about which tells me that you\u2019re not being lazy about this. That\u2019s good! You have drive!\n\nTry not to get too caught up in other peoples lives. I did that and it didn\u2019t help at all.\n\nLastly, you WILL be fine. you WILL find purpose and passion. Please believe that\u2019s \n\np.s. - i am young and heading to college soon aswell. so i really do get it!",

    "postText": "uhm this is my first time posting on reddit. i\u2019m not exactly sure how this goes but i just needed to get this off my chest. i hope i\u2019m doing this in the right community. \n\ni\u2019m 23, female, and from sg. one would say i\u2019m naive and gullible. i don\u2019t deny that. but this incident rlly just confirmed those words.\n\ni received a msg from an unknown number through whatsapp telling me that if i just finished a survey, i\u2019d get 15sgd. initially, i thought it\u2019s another scam. but it wasn\u2019t. i was directed to another person and i was told to click on a link and like the product to get another 15sgd. what harm could it be? i clicked on the link and after sending the ss to her, i gave my paynow details and bam! i received $30!\n\n\u201cclick on this link and join the group. every link and product you like will earn you 3sgd. just complete the 5 tasks consecutively and you\u2019ll earn 15sgd.\u201d\n\nseemed harmless so i went in. true enough, i earned 15sgd. then came the bigger fish. 30% remuneration. 56 gets 73. 688 gets 894. so on and so forth. in the beginning, i obvsly chose 56sgd. and true enough, i received 73sgd in return after following a set of instructions. happy with it, i wanted to try again but 688sgd this time round. now, this one is a group benefit. i was put tgt with another 3 people. first task, i had to invest 1860sgd to receive 2418sgd.\n\ni tried to find that 1860sgd to complete the task. okay, that\u2019s done and dusted. but according to my \u201cmentor\u201d, i accidentally clicked on the wrong thing. i clearly rmbr what i clicked but apparently not. now, there are 3 other members. 2 of whom managed to do properly. 1 member 100% clicked the wrong thing. so now, both of us had to pay 5640sgd as a \u201cdata repair task.\u201d sounds stupid, i know but i\u2019m finding that now. i can get back 7098sgd\u2026 \n\ni decided to let my 668sgd to burn. now i just need 1860sgd to pay back my friend. yes, i borrowed his money just for this stupid thing. \n\nif you\u2019re from sg or anywhere, and you\u2019re willing to help me out, i\u2019d honestly rlly appreciate it. i just need to pay off my friend\u2019s debt and i\u2019ll wash my hands off this. this is my first and last time believing this.\n\nphew that felt good. not so much, but phew.",

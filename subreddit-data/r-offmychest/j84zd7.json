    "postText": "No one around me really seems to care, because if we are being honest, it\u2019s not really that big a deal, especially because I am a grown man of 31yrs old. \nBut to me this has been such an invigorating achievement!\n  \n  \n All my life I have struggled with my reading, comprehension and learning. It\u2019s not that I cannot read, I can, it\u2019s just that it always feels like a huge chore, I get mixed up at times and have to re-read, and wherever possible I always avoid reading out loud, as some how I get things muddled up in my head and never read things accurately. I made my way through my school days always messing up and being teased and laughed at because of the slow pace of my reading. Because of this I made a big effort to make sure that as best I could I would never allow my professional career to be effected, I wanted to insure that all my emails and work would be of the highest standard, I wouldn\u2019t allow myself to look stupid as an adult. Which for the most part I have been able to do, but a quick glance at my posts and comments will show that I am still prone to mistakes, which of course on Reddit means you are totally spell and grammar checked instantly and belittled if you slip up. Reading even on here mostly feels like work, it takes my brain a large amount of extra effort to accurately read anything, I get \u201cstrain\u201d headaches and quickly tire when reading, even if it\u2019s short titles on posts. \n \n \nSo for me reading has never been my idea of fun or enjoyable, it\u2019s always been a step towards learning or work and I\u2019ve never gotten beyond that with my attempts at reading for pleasure. I am a big fan of military history and of medical study to do with emergency medicine or first aid, I even studied at becoming a paramedic for a short time before my study opportunity was abruptly ended. So in a way I find those subjects the easiest to begin to read in. One of the first books I\u2019ve ever read that wasn\u2019t because of study or school, was The Diary of Anne Frank, it took me 2yrs to finish cover to cover, but I was 17yrs old and it was my first ever book away from school and I still felt accomplished! I found a series of books, 4 in total that were first hand fictional stories based around the real conquest of Genghis Khan, imagined stories about his planning and conversations etc. I took me 7yrs to complete the books, but at 26yrs I decided that recreational reading wasn\u2019t for me. At age 29 after watching the series Band Of Brothers for about the 50th time, I brought myself Major Richard \u201cDick\u201d Winters book, recounting the events of WWII from his vantage point. It combined my love of military history with my love of the TV series, and over a 6 month period I read the book. But it still really really took so much effort. \n \n \nNow with Covid-19 effecting everything, and a prolonged bout of severe illness on top of my disability, combined with a less than ideal living situation and battling my chronic depression after attempted suicide earlier in the year, I found myself with a tremendous amount of time, isolated in my tiny bedroom bored out of my mind which was further whittling at my mental health. I picked up a book entitled SAS: Ghost Patrol, which was a historic telling of the very beginnings of the SAS fighting with a special unit known as the Long Range Desert Group, who specialised in crazy daring deadly raids on the Nazis in Northern Africa during WWII, and focused on a hugely brave and bold attack on a Nazi port of Tobruk. I began reading, and soon I was realising that I was reading well into the early hours of the night, night after night! And just like that I had finished the book, in less than 3 weeks! I had actually thoroughly enjoyed it! Then I picked up the next, and then the next and soon within a short 8+/- weeks I had completed 3 books, three entire books read and most crucially ENJOYED! I am so excited and proud of myself! I just had to tell someone. I have just picked up my next booked entitled \u201cMarch Battalion by Sven Hassel\u201d!  Thank you for listening.\n \n \n \nEdit: Wow! This has blown up far beyond what I ever thought possible! Thank you so so much to everyone for sharing such kindness and support! It\u2019s a bit overwhelming. I have tried and will try to get a reply to everyone who comments, but incase I don\u2019t I hope no body is upset, because there is hundreds of comments and I am struggling to read them all in a timely fashion! Also a big big thank you to everyone for the awards, I received my first platinum award today, which is just WOW! Thank you! \n\nAlso I\u2019ve found a link to a website with simulates what it can be like for those of us with dyslexia or other learning difficulties when trying to read.

His book about his time in the British Army as a cavalry man, eventually getting to the rank of Corporal of Horse which is the cavalry regiments version of Sergeant, and how he made the longest ever confirmed kills in sniping history at 2475 meters with only a .338 rifle. A shot that most people couldn\u2019t even see at that distance, and a shot that would be stretching the killing range of even a .50 cal sniper rifle. \n \n \nMy next book is called March Battalion by Sven Hassel!",

Im 24 and more than sure I have ADHD which contributed to my miserable high school years. I've tried reading more to help myself. So far this year I have completed 3 books too. All self help-ish or info books. One being a memoir on anxiety. Took me almost 6 months to read the memoir. I think people like us really have to push even harder than regular brained humans to do the basic things everyone has an easier time grasping. Its so overwhelming sometimes having to explain why I didn't understand something I just read, 3 times. \nVery proud of this achievement. Definitely something to feel good about. Keep going.",

I think the biggest difference being diagnosed make is during ones high school years, I was in a Special Ed class, and I got support during my exams from a specialist occupational therapist who sat with me one on one making sure that I had a good and clear comprehension of the exam questions. And during the exams where spelling and grammar where not scored on, I would give her my answers to the questions verbally and she would help me format my answers in writing so that I made my answers and knowledge were expressed correctly. Even with that help I still did averagely when I graduated, the only A+ I got was in computing, which was based on course work and a final presentation of my \u201cprogramming\u201d model. I am rather gregarious in nature and I can very easily do and prefer public speaking, because my words and ideas are easy to express verbally, it\u2019s just the link between reading and writing where my brain shorts out. But once out into the big adult world of having a job, there is very little benefit to having a diagnosis, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll get a occupational therapist to help you navigate email formatting or report management.

As for page layouts, I find larger books with a bigger font size and larger line spacing easier to read for extended periods (usually found more in hardbacks)  I also read better on non white pages. For me light yellow works best followed by cream. I know others that use blue, pink or green, so it's worth trying several if you don't know your colour.  For pc based work there are a number of software programs that can put screen overlays for you, or for paper you can buy coloured plastic overlays and reading rulers.",

There are ways to help if you want to learn. \n\nBut those books sound pretty complex, and it is wonderful that you enjoyed them. I think if you stick to topics you like, you might find yourself reading even more. If you have to read something you don't like, you will fight it. I used to work with a reading teacher back when my kids were in school. I learned to tailor whatever the lesson was to something the kid enjoyed. I made Halloween/monster ABC flashcards for one little boy. The only thing he liked was scary movies. He was in 1st grade, but his folks let him watch all sorts of R rated horror movies. They had worked on teaching him the alphabet since kindergarten. He got it down in 2 weeks once I started using the flashcards. I also have a much  younger cousin who stopped reading in 1st grade. He could read before that. I know because he read several books to me at various times. But then he was sent to a religious school and he just stopped reading. So I told my Great Aunt to get him Sports Illustrated for Kids. It took a few months, but he started reading again. Having a topic you like can make ALLLLLL the difference.",

Maybe it was because it wasn't mandatory anymore (my school required reading all throughout highschool through tests), or maybe because I started socializing more and working, but I didn't read a book for almost six years. But I just started reading the Harry Potter series again and it's like a spark lit. I carve out any time I can to read it. I bought a book light just so I could read later into the night.

I feel the exact same way with certain movies as I have APD (auditory processing disorder) which is kind of like auditory dyslexia. \n\nMy husband, while normally great about it, loves Shakespeare and has recently been getting into the show that\u2019s based on Shakespeare so all of the speaking is Shakespearean and generally unintelligible for me. I\u2019ve tried watching it a couple times and about 5 minutes in I was so incredibly frustrated I just started playing on my phone. I\u2019ve also heard him listening to it many times and never understand it. It\u2019s like listening to a foreign language. I can pick out individual words which makes sense but the long pauses, unusual sentence structure, unusual words and turns of phrase along with the accents makes it practically impossible for me to understand.\n\nLast night he asked me when we were going to \u2018digest\u2019 some Shakespeare together and I just looked at him like \u2018what are you talking about?\u2019. And then he started \u2018explaining\u2019 how if I just started with a single episode of this series and watched it over and over again I would eventually get better at listening and understanding Shakespearean and future episodes wouldn\u2019t be such a difficult thing. And the thing is, he\u2019s not wrong, it would eventually become easier to understand after maybe the 10th listen but I\u2019d still have to watch each episode multiple times and be constantly rewinding to understand each subsequent episode. This doesn\u2019t seem like an issue to him because he can watch the same series over and over and not get bored I\u2019m definitely not like that. I get very frustrated by my APD and it makes certain series unenjoyable.\n\nHe\u2019s also a wiz with foreign language in general so I feel like the comparison between him and I just doesn\u2019t do my struggles justice. I took Spanish for over 7 years and my final Spanish class was a conversationalist class. I\u2019d thought before that class that I was practically fluent because I could read Spanish and speak it perfectly. But even at that level I couldn\u2019t listen to spanish music well at all and I almost failed that class because I couldn\u2019t understand the person I was talking to.\n\nAnyways, it just really annoyed me that he kinda assumed that with enough work I\u2019d be able to understand Shakespearean when he\u2019s experienced my issues first hand. I use subtitles on practically everything, anytime I\u2019m listening to my lectures he watches me constantly rewind and relisten. We even took a class together a long time ago where the professor had a thick Greek accent and I could not for the life of me understand anything he said. My husband pretty much had to translate the general gist of the lecture after.",

Even if I am super into the film or watch ever, or in an English film that has parts in subtitles because people are talking in different languages, I totally get so lost and bummed out by it! I either have to rewind and pause during them so I can read the subtitles correctly, or I\u2019ve taken to asking my family or others with me to read the subtitles with me. But that gets tedious for everyone so a lot of the time I just try to keep up without it, but it bums me out big time.",

Large print books are easier to read.\n\n3.

I personally LOVE reading, but the way that I compare your dyslexia to me so I can understand it better, is I use Math, so lets say that I'm given a calculus test, and I've never learned calculus before, or only briefly touched on the subject, and I wasn't given a calculator or anything, and the test is about 50 questions or so, I would completely give up, but that's your dyslexia, no calculator, barely any calculus skills, and you still managed to pass that's how I see it, and I'm proud of you dude! I'm so sorry you were battling depression, that must've been horrible, but I'm so happy that you read 3 books and enjoyed them! It's so awesome and I just can't get over how amazing it is that you read and enjoyed it despite you dyslexia, keep up the good work man!",

My mother is an English teacher and we both really like reading and I guess you could say we bonded over it. Although I haven't read for pleasure in years, my brother was always jealous of me for it. Even as an adult and a teacher, he struggles with reading. He gets migraines from it. He can only read for maybe half an hour and then he can't anymore. It's literally painful for him. He used to pay me to read to him and type up his assignments. I didn't do his work, he has written everything out, I just typed it into the computer. \n\nI am so proud of you. You've come a long way and I'm so excited that you can enjoy books. Although I don't know you, I know that this has been hard for you and I'm sorry you were teased about your dyslexia. I know it's probably been a long journey, but just know that a stranger who's seen this before with someone I love, I'm happy for you. I hope you continue to read and enjoy it!",

It\u2019s a free download and you should be able to use it with e-books,  including ones you get online /borrow from the library.  \nIt\u2019s supposed to help your brain read.

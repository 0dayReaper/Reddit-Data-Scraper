    "postText": "I (20 F) don\u2019t really have anyone to talk to this about, but lately my life has been some sort of fanfiction. Just in a bad way. And it hurts deeply.\n\nI met this girl (20F) (she\u2019ll be called Pub) online about a year ago. Originally I didn\u2019t really like her because she was dating my \u201cfriend\u201d at the time and they would always come to me with their problems. I wasn\u2019t really attached because it annoyed me. However, they eventually broke up and I stopped being friends with that friend and became friends with Pub. \n\nWe ended up clicking and I enjoyed talking with her everyday. She was super nice and caring and beautiful inside and out. I was happy to find such a good friend after a life of terrible friends. \n\nEventually we started flirting as a joke and sometimes she was say things that seemed a little too real. I wondered if she liked me, but I dismissed it because I didn\u2019t think she would like me. She was the complete opposite of me in most ways. I\u2019m shy, she\u2019s outgoing. I\u2019m nerdy, she\u2019s a party person. I\u2019m awkward, she\u2019s charismatic. We had a sort of dynamic that made up for what each of us lacked. We were a perfect duo and everyone around us agreed. Even saying we would be a perfect couple to which I chuckled at\n\nUp until a month ago, I thought we were just really good friends. Until I realized that I had fallen for her. I tried suppressing those feelings, and it was working until she told me how she kissed another girl. I was completely heart broken. I cried and cried, I never felt so let down. I decided to stop the fake flirting dynamic because it wouldn\u2019t be good for my mental health. We also live on the other side of the earth from each other. I knew neither I or her could deal with that.\n\nBut those feelings still lingered.\n\nTwo weeks ago, we were on call with our mutual friend and he eventually spilled how Pub liked me. Not even liked, head over heels in love. I was baffled and I got my hopes up for a moment, until she said she didn\u2019t like me anymore because of the distance between us.\n\nThis was the ideal situation. I was let down, we wouldn\u2019t have feelings for each other, we could be friends, we could pretend nothing happened. It would all be ok.\n\nBut those feelings still lingered.\n\nI grew even more upset after that night. Even more crying. I keep blaming myself. If I was richer so I could move closer. If I was more lovable she would hold on. If I had liked her sooner she wouldn\u2019t see me as a friend or I could\u2019ve been over it by now.\n\nBut now I\u2019m stuck wishing she was here with me so this hole wouldn\u2019t be in my heart.\n\nThis whole situation makes me sick, but I still can\u2019t let go for some reason. I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nThe worst part is that I\u2019m the only one left like this.\n\nBecause these feelings still linger.",

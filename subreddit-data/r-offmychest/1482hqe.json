    "postText": "My son is 19.  I was a single mom for years.  His biological father and I were involved from the time I was 14 until I found out I was pregnant at 23. We were engaged.  I left because he was sleeping with a co worker who he is now married to. He ignored my son until he was 3. He told everyone,  including his own mother that he was not my sons father.  His family also shunned me and my son.  Then out of nowhere I get served, he was fighting me for full custody.  DNA in check, and he is absolutely the father  (duh). His reasoning was that he didn't want to pay back child support when my son turned 18.  So he thought it would be cheaper to have him full time.  That didn't work, however he was granted visitation which he rarely took. My son paid the price emotionally as it took a toll on him.  He would skip sporting events claiming that his other kids had events too and since they were younger than him, it wasn't  fair.  I put my son in therapy when he was 13.  They (him and therapist)  came up with the plan that he would ask his dad for one on one time for a certain number of times.  And when that time came and went,  they would re evaluate.   If he had made an effort x amount of times, they would move forward with whatever they had discussed.   If he hadn't, then the boundaries he had set prior had to be followed through with.  The number I found out much later was 23.  23 times he asked for one on one time.  His father didn't make one.  Not. One.  My son is 19 and his father was court ordered to pay a 1/3 of his college education and expenses.  I have to harass him for every fucking dime and I'm done.   I'm so fucking done.  I pay my 1/3 and my sons, and currently his father's.  Why in the fuck would a person even enter a child's life with absolutely no intention of any follow through emotionally or financially? Yet my son sees him taking multiple vacations with his wife and other children.  I hate him.  I truly fucking do.  I am debating on whether or not to take him back to court, or just be done.  I've always taken the high road, but don't feel like I can any longer.  However, I do not want my son to have any more anguish.  So much has been left out. But this is the main gist of things.  I didn't think it was possible to hate, truly HATE another human being.....but I do.  I can only hope that one day he will see the turmoil his actions have caused.\n\nEDIT:  I have read through each and every comment amd want to thank all of you for your support! It has given me strength! \nEarlier this evening, at everyone's advice, I sat my son down and spoke with him about everything.  He said I needed to do what I felt I had to do, and if that meant taking him to court, then do it.  I'm waiting to hear back from my attorney.  \nFor clarification, my son wanted to give his father that many chances. I had nothing to do with that.  That was what he had decided with his therapist.  I did not ask what they talked about in sessions.  That was the whole reason for him going. To have a safe place to vent and help set boundaries. I did notice a change in him after that.  And it was when he was 15 that he told me about the 23 chances.",

Later in life he got in contact with me to whine about not being allowed to see his children (which wasn\u2019t true).\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how many times since I was old enough to understand that I\u2019ve wished my mother would (in the past) or would have (in the present) sued him for the child support he never paid. The amount of stress she thought we\u2019d have by dealing with court had to be less than the amount of stress we had because we had no money. \n\nI\u2019ve never been a parent in this sort of position, but I think I can understand how you feel. I\u2019m sorry for you and for your son that this is something you have to deal with. Some people are just a POS.",

I\u2019m 24 and I\u2019m certainly not; your brain doesn\u2019t stop developing until 25. I grew up in an abusive household where my mom was absolutely evil. My dad never stood up for me (that I saw. He claims they had private talks, but nothing changed and he has never acknowledged how much I have been hurt). I can\u2019t trust either of them because (at least in my mind) I basically don\u2019t have a mom, and my dad is her husband first. I\u2019m *just now* at *24* able to process just how hurt I am by everything. It feels like daily, another boulder of \u201cWow you were hated, weren\u2019t you?\u201d falls from the sky and onto me.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say, is he will remember you fighting for him over the outcome. If you need that money, *go get it!!* Even if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s what your (AND HIS) baby is owed just by being born.\n\nDon\u2019t let him win.

He paid his child support.  Went to all their events.  We had 3 kids together. When the youngest was 2 my ex started drinking more, skipping work, spending our money on I\u2019m not really sure what\u2026. Then all in one short period I found out he hawked my wedding rings, stole our 5 yr olds birthday money, I found charges on all my credit cards I didn\u2019t authorize, he received ROSES at my house from another woman\u2026 so I left.  We went back and forth for about 3 years until I told him to either be part of our kids lives or just walk away.   He walked away.  He moved to New York with one of the woman he was cheating with and he hasn\u2019t seen or spoken to my kids in 5 years.  I had to put all of them in counseling. He pays no child support bc as soon as he married his new wife, she made him file for disability.  He got it.  He can\u2019t work but he was able to build a new fence in his backyard.  \ud83d\ude44.  I went to court and had our court order changed and I have sole custody.  My kids are better for it now but it\u2019s not easy.  The cherry on the cake when when him and his new wife got together\u2026 we all found that her 11yr old son wa a actually my ex\u2019s kid.  He cheated on his previous wife with this woman and fathered a kid no one knew about.  They knew the whole time and my ex never said a word. He never saw the kid until he was 11 either.  I had another step child the whole time I was with him and he never said a word to me about the kid. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.

In fact, she supported their kids' relationship with him and never made him out to be the monster he was (he walked out on Christmas Day and told the kids he doesn't want them and took the TV with him). All 3 kids are in therapy now. My aunt tried to take the high road, but she could afford to raise them all by herself. She had to sell her house while she was upside down on the mortgage, and has been upside down on every car she had while raising them and just keeps trading down to cheaper cars.\n\nNone of her children have a strong relationship with her (even though she busted her ass for them) because she went crazy after carrying all the weight of the parenting and never getting any child support. Her ex has a new daughter who basically has EVERYTHING and my 3 cousins who he walked out on flock to him because he has money. Lots of money. All the money he OWES their mom for paying the kids' way through college and beautician school and acting school in New York.\n\nGet this - I just found out he bought a huge new house and his new wife (who is actually pretty nice in general) secretly reached out to beg my aunt to sign away all his debt because they couldn't buy the house until he paid all his backed up child support. And my aunt just let it go because she felt bad for their new daughter and didn't want her to suffer like my cousins did.\n\nShe's a mess. You have to take care of you in order to take care of your son. Good luck and I'm so sorry. Good job getting your son into therapy now. He'll thank you later.\n\n[Edit: Fixed semantics]",

She took him to court to lower his child support payments to $132 a month just to try and get some help and he still wouldn\u2019t pay.  When she got word of where he worked she\u2019d call family responsibility and he\u2019d quit his job instead of letting them take his money.  The system is no better. He\u2019d get a letter threatening jail time so he\u2019d pay 1 month, $132 and then we\u2019d never see anymore until years later if he got another jail threat.   \n\nMy mom asked him to pay for some of my braces and he was hugging me (one of the few times he was in my life) and straight up said no.   \n\nHe had a couple strokes and is on disability as far as I know, and we were getting $20 bucks a month during the pandemic. Which whew, big money, so helpful.   \n\nHe got married years ago now and I wasn\u2019t invited. My sister (half sister) was and signed as the witness.  They\u2019re bffs.   He\u2019s now back with her mom as far as we know from the message she sent us last year when he went to the hospital again.   And no that\u2019s not his wife nor his he divorced.  \n\nMy mom definitly gave up when I was a late teen on even being bothered with it and I think it helped her a lot to just not even try.  It\u2019s not worth it at all for your mental health.  He\u2019s never going to help you and you\u2019re never going to see that money.  \n\nAs for your son, he\u2019s gonna have to work threw all those issues.   If he\u2019s in therapy he\u2019s doing great! I haven\u2019t worked threw mine at 30 but I don\u2019t cry about him like I used to and that\u2019s good enough for me right now.

You have every right to take him to court again. But if you are truly exhausted, maybe you should let it go and save some peace for you and your son.

I know not everyone is that lucky but I think my mom did the best thing for us.

Give it to your son\u2019s tuition. You get to win and do does your son. The other party suffers his loss. He is a loser. He\u2019s an empty man. His family suffers his presence. You are free of him and so is your son. Celebrate this. Let your son see this as a victory rather than rejection. Good riddance. And tell your son to be a better man than his father so that humanity has a hope of improving and leaving these dead logs behind.\n\nEdit: so many typos.

Dad who cheated with a coworker (and more), denied paternity even though he knew it was guaranteed, tried to get visitation rights after paternity was done, never visited or spent time with us, didn\u2019t pay child support or for college (he would throw a literal few dollars my mom\u2019s way every once in a while). The only difference is my dad didn\u2019t have another family, he was just a dick. Watching his dad be a good dad to other kids would have been so hard for him. I\u2019m so glad you got your son therapy, my mom didn\u2019t and it caused a lot of issues for me and my sister trying to cope by ourselves. I\u2019m 25 and just now dealing with it in therapy.

That's 22 years after they broke up, be better parents than the parents I had please.\n\n\nOne of my favorite side notes is that they ignored all of my medical issues as a child and now I have a lung condition that could have been treated when I was a kid and I had scoliosis that could have been at least mitigated as a kid, but they thought that the best thing to do for my back pain when I was a kid was by me a $92 Ikea foam pad to sleep on.\n\nNow that I have severe back pain and I can only really work for about 4 to 6 hours a day I get judged by my peers and I get judged by my family because I'm muscular and 28 and fit but I have literal curves in my spine that are pinching nerves and making sections of my back and neck and hands go numb.\n\nThey also taught me basically nothing as a child and I worked for some really shitty construction companies because I figured oh you just have to have a job and any job is just a good job, and I inhaled tons of asbestos and now I have two herniated discs in my back because I just had no idea about any of that shit until it was too late because nobody educated me, I dropped out of school because I was being bullied constantly and my parents were moving me around so much and treating me like such shit at home I could barely sleep and get up on any sense of a schedule so I just ended up pretty uneducated for quite some time and had to take it into my own hands but by that time I had already dealt some pretty decent damage to my body.\n\nAlso got into drug addiction of course because that was just an absolutely perfect way to feel not like shit when I was 14, so then I spent 5 years addicted to cocaine and one of those years I smoked some crack even, horrible horrible times in my life, I've been sober off of any hard drugs for 5 years now but I still smoke cannabis and drink coffee.\n\nI'm not saying I have it the worst that I'm not saying this is the entirety of what I've experienced or that I am absolved of the consequences of all of my actions, which just isn't true I have made conscious decisions to make mistakes in the past that I've had to own up to, but my point is if you're going to have sex without a condom think about the anguish that you're going to cause a kid by not showing up or even being there and not showing up emotionally. The fact that we don't have a required license to procreate is actually kind of amazing, how many societal issues could be solved by mending the broken home dynamic?",

It's your love he will carry with him through his life, your love that sustains him.  \n\n\nMy Dad died of cancer when I was 19.  He re-entered my life but too much time had passed.  When he died my friend said to me \"at least he can't hurt you anymore\" and it stung so much and was so true.  I spent my childhood waiting for him.  And the grief that came with his death chases me to this day.  And it was the grief that all that waiting was for nothing.  I never got to have the Dad I was waiting for, that I thought he could have been.  And I didn't realise at the time that even if he'd lived, I don't think I would have got that Dad anyway.    \n\n\nIn some way you always hold out hope that in some way they're going to magically turn into a proper Dad and fix everything that was broken.  But even if tomorrow he turned around and was perfect, it would make the pain of all the time lost all the more palpable.  \n\n\nOn the other side of that, (and I say this to my Mum a lot), YOU were there.  You held him, you stood by him through all of that painful absence and silence and I promise you it counts.  It counts so much to have someone on your team and in your corner.

At the end of the day it is you who has to pull the trigger, so to say, but if your son is with you 100%, then, in my opinion, it would be much easier for the both of you since you'd know you can lean on eachother s shoulder in times like this.\nIf he doesn't wish to get involved then again is your decision if you want to follow through. But is definitely worth knowing his side and reasoning. It won't be easy but at least you know where both of you stand and approach it as calmly and understandable as possible. A fight with him is probably the last thing you want.\nAnd mark this. You brought this boy in to the world and raised him to become a fully grown man. You are a warrior mom, a true lioness!",

Court should have happened years ago. Once they are 18 I don\u2019t think court is an option. Have zero expectations and zero contact. Do what you can for your son to find scholarships and grants. I\u2019m sorry you have been through this and I get it but for yourself and your son\u2019s mental health just be self sufficient and walk away. Completely disconnect from this asshole and stop putting expectations that you are ever going to get a shred of money or time from him. You are just torturing yourself and your son with that. \nMake your own life on your own terms with out him factoring in. It can be done and you can do it by yourself. No it\u2019s not \u201cfair\u201d but you can\u2019t get blood from a turnip either. It\u2019s liberating to walk away -men like that are cancer to your and your sons soul. Not worth it.",

We were granted full custody of him after his bio dad spent years getting arrested for assault, arson, gun and drug charges.

My kid hasn\u2019t seen him since 2013. Now out of nowhere he wants to have the agreement amended. Problem is, we live in a state where he is a wanted for felony assault charges that he fled the state from. So we have that going for us, which is nice.\n\nI hate him so much. I hate how he has made my son feel like he\u2019s not good enough to have his dad care about him. Every holiday he sends him a card saying how much he misses him and sends old pictures of them together  it he hasn\u2019t attempted shit to try and get back into his life. I wish that he\u2019d just give up completely and let us adopt him but he won\u2019t because of his pride.\n\nSo I feel you on this. I feel the anger and resentment. It\u2019s completely valid.

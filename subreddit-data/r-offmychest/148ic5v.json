    "postText": "my whole life at the moment is a lie. i (20f) have lied to everyone i know. i\u2019m not going to go into to details about what the lie was but it has involved me moving half way across the country to a new city for something that didn\u2019t even happen. i am all alone here. i want to move home and have told my dad but he believes it will be a bad idea and a waste of the opportunity i have been given but the thing is i haven\u2019t even been given an opportunity. \n\nThe reason i lied is so stupid and looking back now i don\u2019t even know why i did it. But after telling people about it they were so happy for me and i didn\u2019t really think it was that big of deal. i could feel it getting out of hand so i started saying things like \u2018i don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right time\u2019 and \u2018i\u2019m not sure if i want to\u2019 but they kept telling me i was wasting the opportunity. my lie has snowballed so much that i am literally 3000 miles away from anyone i know. and i hate it here. i miss everyone, i\u2019m poor, and so incredibly lonely. if i stop lying and tell the truth i would be disowned by everyone.\n\nmy mental health is worse than ever and i have thought about offing myself but if i did everyone would find out about my lie and that will be the last thing people think about me.\n\ni definitely have a problem. i\u2019m pretty sure i\u2019m a pathological liar. i will never tell anyone i know personally that all this was a lie. i\u2019m so desperate to get out of this situation i have been fantasising about getting sick and having to move home, or making up another lie that can get me out of this! \n\ni\u2019m so ashamed and disgusted with myself but i still get praised by people from home about how amazing this is. it feels good but it\u2019s all fake and with every compliment i feel more more like a horrible person. i\u2019ve wasted so much money on something that was never real. some how no one has caught on but i guess that is easy because i live so far away. my relationships are falling apart because i\u2019m so ashamed to talk to anyone.\n\ni feel like such an idiot and i don\u2019t even know what to do anymore.\n\n(sorry for any spelling and gramma mistakes)",

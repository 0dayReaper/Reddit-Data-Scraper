    "postText": "First, when I was 19, my friend group had a (much) older friend. She\u2019d get our booze and party favors and it was fun and casual. One night we were all at my apartment, she wanted to go lay down in my bed, fine, didn\u2019t think much of it. Later in the night, I was ready to sleep. I go up there, she appears to be out, on the side of the bed. I just lay on the other side and shut my eyes. She starts moving over on me, saying promiscuous things. I\u2019m drunk, confused, uncomfortable with what is happening and very dazed. She gets my pants undone, says \u201cit\u2019s just a blow job.\u201d Emotionally I\u2019m saying no, but inhibitions are down I suppose. Next I know she\u2019s on top of my, riding.. I say \u201cstop..\u201d \u201cstop..\u201d STOP!\u201d She stops and say \u201cthat one sounded serious.\u201d Because I was. She got off me pretty quick, cleaned herself up in the bathroom and left. I felt petrified and just never spoke to her again. She\u2019d come to my place and bang on the door and I\u2019d ignore it. I just completely shutdown and never wanted to confront her ever again. \n\nSecond time at 27 years old. I\u2019m home for the holidays and staying at my brother\u2019s house. His girlfriend of 3ish years gets inebriated and her uncomfortably flirts with me in the bar, in front of my brother, but behind is back. It\u2019s so wrong to me. I wouldn\u2019t ever think of messing around with a girl in a relationship, ESPECIALLY my brother\u2019s! We get back to his place, a few drinks later my brother goes to bed. Shortly after I go to the guest room and his girlfriend says to my brother \u201coh I\u2019ll get the Roku set up for him.\u201d She \u201cstruggles\u201d with it while slowly pushing herself on me.. I\u2019m not giving in.. but her persistence was insane. I even at one point said \u201cthis is like porno,\u201d like just ridiculous what she was doing, like it wasn\u2019t real. I\u2019m genuinely passing out after about 45 minutes of this. I\u2019m wearing night time long johns, and being vulnerable and on my back, she reaches under the blanket, pulls it out and goes down.. it\u2019s so wrong, but body doesn\u2019t care what the mind thinks. I get off.. and roll to my stomach so she can\u2019t try to keep it going.. which she was. I\u2019m just sad and disappointed in myself. She gets the hint and leaves and profusely apologized the next morning. I swallowed my feels and moved on. Because what else can I do.\n\nI\u2019ve always struggled being open letting a potential partner close to me, and I don\u2019t think these situations helped that at all..\n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far. Never put any of this into words before.",

Take care of yourself and intimacy will find you again when your mind is ready for it. And even if you never find a partner in this lifetime, I hope you have another outlet for happiness. \n\nIf you are interested in dating again, therapy is helpful (I know, obvious answer) if that\u2019s something you\u2019d be comfortable with. I\u2019ve been sexually assaulted by more men than I can count on one hand and it took me forever to be okay with a man touching me without feeling panic. It took a combination of speaking to a therapist and getting lucky enough to meet the right man who I felt safe with and who respected my boundaries. Most people are not creepy, but it sucks that a handful of bad people can fuck up the human mind that bad. Most men and women are respectful of boundaries, that\u2019s always something to remember.\n\nBest of luck to you.",

And it seems you\u2019re right that there\u2019s some things I need to work through and actually talk about for once. There\u2019s a lot built up. I appreciate your thoughts.",

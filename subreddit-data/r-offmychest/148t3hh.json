    "postText": "When I was 14 my sister moved out to go to college so it was just my parents and me at home. This meant that I was home alone between the hours I got back from school and when my parents got back from work. I won\u2019t go into details about the circumstances but I was your typical insecure lonely teenager. I started talking to this man who I met online, he was very charming and sweet but it gradually became more. He was my first experience when it comes to explicit sexual acts. It was luckily all online but I did share pictures and videos of myself.\n\nAt first he mentioned he was 20 years old but after a couple of weeks he said he was actually 39. I was too attached to him at that point and said I didn\u2019t mind because I was scared of losing him. His demands for what I did during our cam sessions or for my videos just kept getting weirder and more specific. He wanted me to repeat that I was 14 years old while pleasuring myself, wanted to see what my rooms decorations looked like, wanted me to dress overly girly to the point that its ridiculous for a teenager.\n\nHe showed me porn videos he liked, at first it was adults but after some time he shared pictures and videos of other minor girls doing explicit stuff themselves. At first it started at girls around my age but it gradually became younger and younger. He kept comparing me to them, even said I was too old for him one time and that I was getting too chubby for him. Looking back at pictures from myself back then I was already on the brink of being underweight but he apparently didn\u2019t like it that I was going through puberty changes like my thighs getting slightly bigger. He wanted me to be shaved down there and would get mad if I didn\u2019t want to do it everytime I showered. \n\nI knew that what he sent me was illegal and so harmful but I was really infatuated by him and even got jealous that other girls who he didn\u2019t even know got more praise than I did, even though I literally did every humiliating and painful act he wanted me to do. I started to lose weight very fast and my mom took notice of it. At first I tried to act oblivious but I didn\u2019t want to get put in a clinic so I said that it was because of social media and stuff like that that caused me to become insecure and wanted to diet. She believed that story and I feel so guilty for that, she was there for everything during my recovery and I lied to her and still do whenever that subject comes up again. \n\nEven now when I see my more womanly body I feel disgusted at times because I feel discarded and old, but I can\u2019t stay like my old self. There has to come a point when I rationalize it and realize that what he did was fucked up yet I find excuses every time. \n\nWhen I found out that he recorded and saved all my pictures and videos (even cam sessions) I decided to block him but I\u2019m so mad and disappointed in myself for not reporting him. That it didn\u2019t took me seeing his collection of disturbing content to leave but only when it harmed me as well. I don\u2019t know where he lives, only his first name (which could be made up for all I know) and what he looks like. \n\nMost of the time I just go through the months easily because it has been five years since then but when the topic of my past anorexia experience gets brought up (like today- which is the reason of this post) I sort of just zone out and am back in the headspace of 14 year old me and I can\u2019t get out. I\u2019m scared that this guilt and numb feeling that I get thinking about it will continue until my adulthood :(\n\nJust seeing other 14 year old-ish girls or my little nieces now I just wish I could reverse time and undo it all, or at least hug younger me and say that she deserves better, that I reported him and that other girls won\u2019t experience the same thing. I feel like I failed them.",

    "postText": "We were tag teaming to return a car to a friend. I was following behind him (17) when a rig forced its way in into his lane (he was just far enough ahead of me in the far right lane on a curve that I couldn\u2019t see him).  I honestly don\u2019t know whether or not the rig saw him. Since there was construction, I was guiding him through Bluetooth in the cars directing him where to get off.  I heard him Scream \u201coh shit!  Mom!  No no no no no\u201d then heard a thud and the line went dead.\n\nI saw the car on the side of the road and was luckily able to pull over about 100 feet in front of him. The rig ran him off the road and he scraped the construction wall barriers on the side of the freeway - he was able to recover.  There were more concrete barriers right in front of where I was able to stop.  What if he had lost control and flipped?  What if he was unable to get out of the shoulder and crashed into the barriers?  His screaming will haunt me forever.",

I\u2019ve done the \u2018life before my eyes\u2019 thing and it was terrifying.  I woke up screaming for years afterwards.  Hearing him scream \u2018mom\u2019 and the phone cutting out is indescribably worse.",

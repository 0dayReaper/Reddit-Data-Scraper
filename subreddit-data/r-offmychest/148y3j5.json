    "postText": "Basically venting since there isn\u2019t much actionable I can do beyond malpractice suits and possibly seeking something like therapeutic cloning and neural stem cell transplantation, but my life has fallen apart during the last ~2.5 years. \n\nOne day everything was fine, in terms of background I had a career waiting for me that would earn a rather large amount(very easily within the top 1 percent or 0.5 percent), good college ranked among the top 20 in the country, did very well on stuff like psychometric testing, standardized testing etc. someone happened to be very ill while I was outdoors for a walk and ended up in an ambulance, they got me sick. During the fever which only lasted a couple of days I didn\u2019t think much of it and when it subsided I assumed that was it and it was just some self limiting illness like a virus. Immediately after I started developing awful neurological symptoms that kept progressing and eventually would fluctuate. Terrible disorientation as if I had an altered state of consciousness, pressure and heat in my head(would just atrophy in bed with ice packs on my head all day), blurry vision, neck stiffness(I could touch chin to chest but in doing so it felt rlly taut and odd). Over time I started having tremors in all my limbs, peripheral cyanosis, difficulty breathing, among other issues. The entire time I was pleading with my docs to give me an lp since I suspected meningitis or encephalitis due to the symptoms and exposure event. Finally about a year into this mess I got it, but tests for infection weren\u2019t ordered which Was bizarre. They did a basic panel and found nornal protein and glucose, nornal wbc apparently, and ever since have maintained that I can\u2019t have an infection, despite medical literature saying otherwise. The opening pressure was high though. \n\nI returned to bed and desperately implored them but it was in vain. I even tried flying out of the country multiple times to seek the procedure in Eu, but weird beauracratic laws prevented me from getting it even when docs there agreed with me that it was warranted/indicated. \n\nToday, I still never got a second lp and while I haven\u2019t had cyanosis or extreme head pressure in a while, I feel off/disoriented and can\u2019t think like I used to. Standard cognitive tests r difficult and I\u2019m unable to even remember a short list of 3 words given to me(it\u2019s some dementia screening test commonly done). \n\nI ended up with an acquired arachnoid cyst per my latest mri vs previous ones which u can only get from head trauma, brain bleeding, brain surgery, tumors, or meningitis, and I had/have none of the first 4. \n\n\nNot sure what sort of life I have left to live or if there\u2019s any hope to receive some sort of expensive, experimental procedure. I still spend most of my time in bed since I feel too \u201cfuzzy\u201d to rlly do anything, snd often feel confused and forgetful. I wish I could go back in time to either before I got ill, or just have done more earlier, maybe flown to diff places more frantically or just gotten my hands on iv antibiotics and self administered, idk. It\u2019s a bleak existence now.",

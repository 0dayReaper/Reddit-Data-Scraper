I get it you have no will power and want to destroy your lungs and body, great that is awesome I actively encourage you to take time off your life because clearly you don't care about others.\n\nWhy do I have to pay a premium on my contents insurance because you smoke inside and might cause a fire and burn my place down as well?\n\nWhy do I have to worry about dying in a house fire because you are a lazy bum who might cause a house fire.\n\nWhy do I have to have my apartment smell like smoke and have my stuff damaged because you are a disgusting bum who smokes outside my window\n\nWhy do I have to have public areas ruined because of your disgusting habit.\n\nSmokers you are a literal walking pestilence on this earth and I sincerely am so glad smoking has such a negative effect on your health I just wished we had laws stopping you from selfishly effecting OUR health by your disgusting habit.",

But they can ruin your outdoors experience, lower property values, leave disgusting shit everywhere, permanently scar you or your childs face, ruin your slumber, so on and so forth.",

My point is that many other people impose conditions they find acceptable on those around them with no regard or concern for how others may feel about it. This is part of living in a community of any sort. And it can be very aggravating, especially when theres no recourse available. Such is life.",

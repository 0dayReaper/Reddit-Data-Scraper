    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to work through the aftershock. I was at my job, got a call from his wife, to run over across the street to their house and see why she couldn\u2019t get her husband on the phone. She was in Florida that night, he was here at home. I ran over, looked in the living room window as she had said he would be on the couch working. He was not there. The dogs were loose in the yard and upset. The back door to the house was open. A couch cushion was ripped by the dogs in the yard. I saw his garage lights on and door wide open. Maybe he\u2019s working on his cars, or working on something, right? I ran back and looked in the open garage door. He was hanging there from a beam. A  week ago he was at my place of work (restaurant) and said he was very down and overwhelmed with life. I wish I would have LISTENED.  They appeared to \u201chave it all\u201d as people say. Two very nice houses, nice cars, well paying jobs, an RV, dogs, and they seemed happy as a couple. I just feel numb. I finally went over to see the wife today and hug her. She walked with me to the garage and wanted me to explain what I saw. She said she found where he had been researching suicide for one week on his cell phone. One week before he did it, he was at the restaurant and he said he was feeling overwhelmed and down. I felt compelled that day to hug him as he left and told him he always had my family and my brother to help him if he needed help getting things done, \u201cyou know you have us, we love you and we will be here to help you, we can even come over and hang out some evening\u201c he said \u201cyeah it will be ok everything is going to be ok just got to take it a day at a time\u201d \u2026. I truly feel a sense of guilt for not stopping in that week. My son  saw him two days prior. Mowed his grass and sat with him a bit. He was in his early 50\u2019s. This happened June 10 at 8:30 pm. Thank you for listening, stranger. \nIt\u2019s off my chest.",

Just like cancer is. You would not have blamed yourself had he died of cancer. You should not blame yourself for this either. \n\nDepression removes a person of their agency. It eats away their free will until there is nothing left. There wasn\u2019t anyone to blame for this, just as it wouldn\u2019t have been anyone to blame for cancer.",

My partner and I are getting me in with a new therapist next month to try to figure out a new game plan. I have come very close to attempting again, a few times, within the last year. Depression is no joke, and no amount of great times with friends, love from my partner, or how well my life seems to be going on the outside makes it any less of a daily battle. If I had one wish (that wasn't eradicating depression altogether), it would be that no one blames themselves for 'not doing more' for the people they love who go through with it.",

But so many who have never dealt with it see depression, or any mental health issues as a weakness, laziness, or shrug it off with my favorite line; \"everyone is down from time to time you just have to keep going, don't let anything get you down\". And then those of us with issues will try and hide the problem because, although it shouldn't be, it is taboo and so many clueless people give advice that feels like being kicked while you're down. So you deal with it and hope you don't end up hospitalized again with charcoal pumped into your stomach, because THAT is just another thing for people to talk about, making you feel worse, rinse and repeat the cycle continues.",

I think this would be helpful as what you experienced is very traumatic. \n\nI would also like you to know that really there was nothing you could say or do to prevent it. I'm saying this because I struggled with suicidal thoughts for years, and in my darkest hours, absolutely nothing could change my mind. I knew I was loved. I knew I was surrounded by loving, caring family (my children and grandchildren). But I was convinced there was only one \"answer\". It frightens me to think back on this, and so I have to keep this brief. \n\nI just want you to know that the burden of being responsible for not saying something, not listening quite enough, or not being by his side long enough is not on you. The only thing that prevented me from following thru (before i finally got professional help) was that I couldn't bear for anyone to find me and couldn't come up with any way to keep that from happening (my heart goes out to you). \n\nWhen I think back, that period of my life was harrowing, hollow, and miserable despite the love I had all around me, despite the \"I love you's\" I heard all thru each day. Despite the love written on their faces that nonetheless barely hid the fear they felt because they knew I was fighting a battle they thought that expressing their love and concern would win for me. \n\nAgain I'm really sorry for what you experienced. And I hope that this doesn't come across as completely bleak and heartless, I don't mean it that way. I just don't want you to torture yourself over what you could have done. A professional would be the one who would know what to do and what to say. \n\nFor those who are struggling, please reach out for help. You are not alone. I am someone who has come thru the other side because I got professional help.  I hope this helps in some small way.",

Even mentioned it to my gf, who said maybe it was just a sign he was maturing. I know now that he was trying to make amends and say goodbye, but I had no way to know at the time. But I blamed myself, anyway. Maybe I could have saved him. Maybe, if I had said the right thing, invited him to see me, let him know how much he was loved.\n\nBut he knew all of that, just as surely as your friend's husband knew. He knew it and he had to hang himself, anyway, because life had just become too much to bear. Too much, even with family, even with loved ones doing their best for him. Too much pain, mental anguish, and, in my friend's case, some physical pain as well. But we wonder what we might have done. Of course we do. It's human. It would feel strange not to.\n\nIf that aftershock keeps giving you trouble, don't be afraid to see a therapist if you don't already. That's some pretty serious shit. I hope it helped some to get it off your chest, and I hope everyone involved comes out without too many scars. The pups, too. They were undoubtedly traumatized as well.\n\nIn my case, I don't blame my friend. I knew him since he was a teen, and he had deep issues from early trauma. He couldn't stay any longer. He loved the people in his life, but he couldn't stick around for them when every breath was moment to moment. Maybe it was like that for your friend's husband. I hope he found peace.",

It will probably be helpful to talk to someone about it and work through the emotions coming up now and some that could come up later. I know I'd need to. \n\nAs others have said, OP did more than many would. They did stop and listen and let their friend know they cared and are there for them. There's nothing they could have done to prevent this. But it can still be hard to let go of those kinds of emotions/thoughts. \n\nMy mom died when I was a young adult. We had 'movie nights' once a week and I had to cancel due to a work potluck the following day - needed the time to shop/cook. She didn't answer and didn't call back - but I thought it was because she was mad at me for cancelling. And although all info confirms she had already passed before that night, and of a brain aneurysm,  I couldn't help wonder for a long time if I could have saved her had I not cancelled. It's hard to feel so helpless and I feel for OP.",

The visit wasn\u2019t great - they had had a miscarriage about 6 months earlier and the emotions were tearing them apart, instead of together.  She and I went out with her work friends for drinks and she was trashed and making out with a stranger.   This was NOT the friend I remembered and I was horrified. \n\nThe next night, my last night in town, i declined to go out with her, to \u201crest and pack\u201d.   When he got home from work, he asked me questions about what was up with her and cried bc he knew they were growing apart.  But I was 25 and HER old roommate. I\u2019d only met him a few times. The idea of saying how bad HER behavior was to him seemed disloyal, or wrong in some way I couldn\u2019t explain.    But he was crying.   And they were living in her home town, so he didn\u2019t have close friends there. \n\nI was so torn about what to do, I offered to drive him the 3 hours to his home town, to his friends.   He declined but I didn\u2019t push. I also didn\u2019t contact his best friend - who I actually knew slightly better than I did the husband. \n\nI just let the convo end.  I was in bed before she came home, tho I heard their arguing. \n\n\nThe next day, I got on a plane and flew home. By the time I landed, the husband had committed suicide.  \n\n\nThat was 20 years ago.    So all I can tell you from THIS place and time is that you did what You could.  You DID listen, you did give him that hug and offer what you could.   And yes in hindsight you can want to have done more, you know you thought about doing more and chose not to\u2014 but you made that decision based on the information you had last week, not the information you have today!\n  you\u2019ll probably be hyper sensitive to depression and sadness for a while, but you didn\u2019t have hindsight a week ago.  You didn\u2019t know if it was a bad day or a bad week or these bad thoughts that would take him to suicide.    Know you were there for him a week ago, not guilty that you didn\u2019t know the future.   \n\nAnd accept that the trauma of being the one to find him is real - have grace with yourself and your grieving process (as you will likely find yourself trying to stifle or ignore your own grief as you\u2019ll be helping to support the widow in her grief.  Your pain is also valid).",

Please know that YOU could not have known the tragedy that was going to occur, and you still showed him kindness and love because you're a warm-hearted person who checks in on their loved ones. He had the choice to divulge more information to you during your conversation; you said the right things.\n\nWarning signs are intentionally very hard to find in most people who die by suicide, and there is never any one reason. And like previously mentioned, last exchanges together were filled with you offering support and letting him know that there are resources available. It sounds like your family members are all very close and you should make sure to support one another in these times. Everybody grieves differently, so your family dynamics may shift and change. And that isn't necessarily negative. \n\nTake time for yourself because everyone involved is grieving and has lost a person that held a unique role and place in their heart. If things are unmanageable, nurture your mental health and seek grief counseling. Many practices even offer group/family settings. I wish you and your loved ones well as you process a traumatic event and loss of a person who clearly had many redeeming qualities. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

I knew she was sad and angry, but certainly not like that.\n\nI can't help thinking I should have realized how upset she was. That this wasn't ordinary arguments in a group. It was either worse than she told me, or she was very ill and it had affected her badly. Either way, I missed that.\n\nYou cannot possibly know what is going through someone else's head, even if you speak to them. Some people are much better at hiding it than others. And some people will just play it down as ordinary stress even if you do see that something is off.\n\nThis is not your fault.\n\nPlease make sure you get some support. Please. Your friend is traumatized but you are too. Please don't ignore your needs.",

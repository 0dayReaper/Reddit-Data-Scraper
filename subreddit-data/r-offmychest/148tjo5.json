    "postText": "Firstly the girl in question we shall call Becky. She dated my best friend on and off for 6 months over this time i spent a lot of time with her and we enjoyed each others company I felt safe around her, I mean i don\u2019t think I\u2019m good looking or anything and she in my eyes was a 10 so I just thought we were good friends, they broke up but it led me to greater feelings I know I\u2019m only young but I\u2019ve never ever had a girl come up to me or like me back and every single attempt has ended in rejection. And to clarify I never went behind my friends back and was almost always upfront. Any way after they broke up I spent a-lot of time with this girl and and my feelings grew I told her how I felt and she blanked me but sorted it out and we were friends again, for the three months after she talked about her love interest( which hurt a lot ) but kept going as I still wanted to at least be friends, anyway came to a week before Christmas I was happy, she told me she liked me and I asked her on a date at the end of the week, it started as just me and her but ended up being us and 3 friends, anyway noticed she was spending a lot of time with one of our friends who I introduced to her thought nothing of as he was \u2018just a friend \u2018 but all night they were really close and she almost forgot I was there. Next day I woke up work at 6 am started working heard nothing from her all day which was unusual anyway my mind got away from me and I felt like I was no longer in Beckie\u2019s picture but our friend let\u2019s call him Samual was, asked her about him and she jumped around the answer so cut ties. I still think about Becky almost daily 7 months on with extremely rare interactions and her now being in a relationship with Samual for 7 months. But for some reason she hurt me in some way I\u2019ve never felt before and after Becky I just don\u2019t have a true sense of feelings anymore. But i don\u2019t feel like telling my friend as in some ways it makes me feel weak and petty so I just put on a smile and carry on. \nI just am not sure if how I feel is ok or if i should just \u2018man up\u2019 ?",

And when I mean I get no female interaction, it\u2019s not even through lack of trying. \nAnd yes this is the very basic story just wanted to hear some thoughts",

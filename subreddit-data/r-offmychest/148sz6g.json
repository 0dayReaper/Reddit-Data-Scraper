    "postText": "17/m I haven't been able to understand why I do the things i do. For a little back story my dad passed couple weeks after I was born And before another thing about me I left school in year 10 to work full time (plumbing) been working full times for about 2 and half years. In my early teens(13-16 ish) I launched into as many substances as I possibly could (weed, shrooms, acid, ket, coke, xans, oxys, benzos) pretty much anything I could get and yeah it was good for abit and i felt good but mum would always find that l've been smoking weed and I'd always say I'd stop but never did and just kept causing her heartache. I stopped smoking weed about a year ago haven't missed it but now I just find myself ruining every chance at being happy.\nExhibit A being recently I met this girl at a party and 1 really like her we went out and i had a great time yet when i was at another party this week I went way out of my way too get with someone and in the moment I felt nothing but the next day I sorta found myself feeling shit about what I did and there's no other reason for me doing it other than ruining what I could have with this other girl. Why do I feel like I don't deserve to be happy and why do I try too ruin it when it seems so close.",

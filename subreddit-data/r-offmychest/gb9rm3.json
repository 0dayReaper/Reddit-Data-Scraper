    "postText": "She is my neighbors only daughter and she\u2019s about 14 years old. My neighbors were really struggling with her and how violent she got with them. She attacked her mom with a knife once but she thankfully didn\u2019t sustain any serious injuries. My amazing neighbors did all they could to raise her well and spent so much time out of work taking care of her and putting all they effort they could to raise an autistic child. It was starting to damage their marriage.\n\nShe liked to come over and see our cat when we let him out. She never did anything but look at him and we even let her pet him a couple of times. One day, we couldn\u2019t find our cat after letting him roam around so we thought he just wanted some extra time out. Well, on my way to go to the store, I saw our neighbors daughter inside my cats stomach, pulling all its insides out on her driveway. She also dismembered a lot of my cats body including its head. I immediately called my neighbor and told him what I saw. He was very sorry and felt really bad. I told him not to worry about it and that it\u2019s not his fault. The police came shortly after because another neighbor reported the situation to 911. The cops were disturbed but understood the situation and took my request not to press charges on them. \n\nThat was the final straw for them. The violent and gory situation was too much for them and they couldn\u2019t take any more chances, although they still loved her very much. Within the next month she was out of the home and living in a sort of group home for children with severe mental disorders. \n\nIt was really disturbing to see and it\u2019s been on my mind a lot. My wife was devastated and we miss our kitty. He was our first pet and only pet. I\u2019m not mad at the girl who did it, just sad that the condition she has has made her this way. \n\nThanks for hearing me out. It feels good to tell people this story.\n\nEDIT: We believes she might have some form of psychopathy and not just autism. I\u2019m aware this is unusual for people that have autism alone. \nThank you all for the kind comments and reassurance. I really appreciate and think you all are awesome.",

We would usually cut a thread with the current headline, but OP has made it clear that they aren\u2019t claiming such a connection.    \n- Clearly the child has issues, but the possible reasons are [multi-faceted](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-equation/201104/children-who-are-cruel-animals-when-worry), and none of us here can give a diagnoses.\n\n\u2014-\n\nEdit to add:    \n\n- Don\u2019t tell OP to get violent, or make iamverybadass descriptions of violence you\u2019d do.\n\n\u2014-\n\nEdit edit: Due to continued rule breaking, I\u2019m locking the thread.   \nThank you to those who participated in good faith and following rules.",

I feel sorry for all parents and guardians who have to make the choice to keep the child at home or send them away for their own good. No matter what, people will judge them and say they abandoned their kid when things got difficult, meanwhile the parents must feel incredibly guilty. Nobody should judge when a parent or guardian sends them to a facility because all cases are different and you have no clue what it must be like to live and take care of someone with such extreme needs. Op sounds like a very understanding person and a great neighbour and the parents sound like good people as well. I hope the kid gets the care they need and perhaps improves somewhat or at least learns coping mechanisms for their urges and behaviour. Some facilities are great at that even for the most severely autistic. But at least she'll have the supervision needed to keep her and everyone else safe.",

She will need real treatment with good psychologists and I hope she will get past this and learn to deal with her actions, but I also hope the people that are on this will look at her family and surroundings as well since she might have been suffering severe abuse resulting in this horrid behaviour. \n\nJust to back your claim up: \n\n\"Another \u2018triad\u2019 of psychological factors that have been associated with IATC are three specific characteristics of personality \u2013 Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy (the so-called \u2018Dark Triad\u2019). Studies carried out by Dr. Phillip Kavanagh and his colleagues have examined the relationship between the three Dark Triad personality traits and attitudes towards animal abuse and self-reported acts of animal cruelty. They found that the psychopathy trait is related to intentionally hurting or torturing animals, as was a composite measure of all three Dark Triad traits.\" taken from Psychology Today, but there are multiple studies across the board to read up on.

Autistic 'tantrums' aren't actually tantrums at all. They're called meltdowns and they usually occur because the autistic person is in some way overwhelmed - usually by sensory stimulus - which for a lot of us can be physically painful. A tantrum is a reaction to not getting your own way; it's emotional and can be regulated. An autistic person will most likely not be able to regulate a meltdown once it begins; they need space from whatever it is that's triggering the overwhelm (eg loud noises, too many people, painful touch etc). Meltdown triggers can be different for every autistic person.",

Because one experience is not all or even the majority of experiences. I won't presume to know where on the spectrum your son or the other autistic people you know land, but I'm working with moderate to severe cases.

I hadn't even looked at him.\n\nOne of my nephews is autistic and incredibly violent (admitted into the children's mental hospital twice as a child so far), and when I looked into it, his comorbidities are not unheard of in autistic people. Things like disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and intermittant explosive disorder are some of the many conditions that can be found in children with autism, and they are found more often than in the general population. At least, that's what they told us at the hospital when my nephew went in the first time. That's what I started my research looking into.\n\nIf you look into it, there is a sizable number of ASD people who are VERY violent. That's why facilities like the one OPs neighbors sent their daughter to exist, and they have a lot of autistic people in them. \n\nSo, most autistic people aren't violent, but a non-negligible percentage of people who are violent have autism.\n\nETA: also, I have mentioned this before and people are often surprised to know that, while most people with ADHD/ADD aren't criminals, about half of all criminals in prison in the US have ADHD/ADD. That is another issue that is commonly comorbid with ASD.",

The alternative (Juvenile Detention/Jail, progressively worse crimes, etc.) is not pretty. I work for a company that does supported living (in-home care) for people with disabilities, and several of our individuals are part of a program called Community Protection (CP). This program takes individuals that have either committed a crime but found unfit to stand trial, or even individuals that were found guilty of a crime(s) and allows them to re-enter society under the pretenses that they will be within line-of-sight of their staff (Direct Support Professional) 24/7. We also have a kids (ages 8-18) program. If she had remained in her parents house, in your neighborhood, she likely would have ended up in our CP program for the rest of her life. \n\nDisability/Mental Health research is relatively new, and only recently has it been discovered that sticking hundreds of individuals with Intellectual/Developmental disabilities in a hospital is not good. Community based living (including group home setup) is good for these individuals, as well as the community as a whole as it gives the general public a chance to get used to someone with a disability and learn to treat them with respect.\n\nETA: I\u2019m so incredibly sorry about your cat.

It's constantly on my mind. \n\nMy mom abandoned my sister and I after cheating on our dad, doing drugs, etc. Not long after she had two more kids, both who were disabled in some way. I'm not 100% sure. If I recall correctly, my half brother is autistic and half sister was mute for most of her young childhood. After turning 11 I stopped talking to my mom because her lying and abandoning me hurt too much.\n\nMy mom had severe mental illness that has been passed down throughout the family. I suffer from depression and anxiety and my sister is bipolar like my mom. I believe my half siblings have some of it too in some way from what I've heard, but I'm not sure. Because I cut contact with my mom, I never knew them. Last I saw them they were babies, but I've heard things. The difference between us was I and my full sister had a stable home, while my half siblings didn't and were constantly dealing with my mom bouncing in and out of rehab and moving all of there US to dodge CPS.\n\n2018 my mom died and CPS called me, because they wanted me, a 22 year old at the time, to take care of the kids. I knew my half brother was disabled and I wasn't sure what was going on with my half sister (I heard she had scoliosis at one point but I'm not sure, my mom tended to lie a lot). Then I heard from my moms roommate. \n\nShe had no problem telling us about how my half sister was abusing my mother, physically and emotionally, despite being 12. Apparently my half sister would hit her, would fight tooth and nail, etc. The roommate went on to mention that my half sister killed her dog but wouldn't go into details. Then she told me that the morning my mom died, she heard my half sister and mom fighting, silence for a few minutes, then my half sister screaming and crying. She found my half sister hunched over my moms dead body.\n\nThe police investigated, I tried to get CPS to get a therapist for my half sister but they didn't help. I had 3 different case workers. They kept passing me around while they were temporarily holding the kids while I made a decision. Coroner work came back after 4 months and the cause of death was ruled as undetermined. They couldn't figure it out. I talked to the police who were helping, they were very supportive of me. I was pulled aside and the main two agreed with me that it was all very shady and they think my half sister MAY have something to do with it a swell. \n\nMeanwhile CPS was still fucking me around. I don't talk to my moms family but my maternal grandparents forced me to pay for the cremation of the \"mom\" who abandoned me (less the state take her, which would hurt my full sister and half siblings and wasn't fair to them), and pushed my half siblings who were complete strangers on me. My maternal aunt got ahold of me and said she'd take the kids (she's a nurse) but the kids told the CPS workers they didn't want to go to her. \n\nI had to make a decision, and a part of it will always stay with me. I told CPS I couldn't take them. I wasn't equipped to take care of them. I was 22, for fucks sake. I just got out of an abusive relationship and was dealing with my own mental illness. Plus, these were two strangers, 12 and 15. I didn't know them. In fact, I wasn't even sure of my half sisters name as my mom changed it 3 times while I still spoke to her. I wasn't sure how to take care of my half brother as from what I heard, he needed constant care. and quite frankly, I was afraid of my half sister. \n\nShe was never charged with anything, and my dad cautioned me that everything I've been told about her could just be rumors... but would the roommate REALLY lie about my half sister abusing my mom? Would she REALLY lie about her dog being killed? \n\nI let CPS take them. I told them I couldn't care for them. I was worried for my own safety, for my families safety, and pets safety. I know my half sister was a victim of circumstances, who had a bad mom and an unstable life growing up which lead to drastic effects but... I couldn't do it. Like I mentioned since then I've had 3 case workers, each who miraculously get multiple two week long vacations just about every other month! how lovely! /s Each one I'd have to re-explain why I think my half sister needs to be in therapy and why I can't stress enough that she needs proper help. They'd assure me and then wouldn't call me back for several weeks straight.\n\nThey never took me seriously. I tried to send a letter to my half siblings and maybe plan a day to meet up, small steps, but CPS told me the kids are now not interested in it. Fair enough, I was literally a stranger to them. CPS said they were taken into a lovely family for fostering and that recently, the family agreed to adopt them. Which means the kids did well. That my half sister was doing well. \n\nIt... makes me think. My mom was supposedly sober, but when I got to her car to clean it out, I found it FILLED with empty alcohol bottles. I didn't have the heart to tell my full sister that our mom was still a drunk when she died. \n\nThe kids had lived in at least 4 different states. My moms boyfriend, one of the kids dads, was abusive. I saw first hand the fights and the blood. It makes me wonder. Was it that my mom got her shit together too late?  Was the damage already done? Or was the damage still on going? What had they seen? What did my half sister see, to make her act so violently? The type of men my mom was around... did they target my half sister? was she abused by them? Or was it simply the chaotic and unstable life of my mom that fucked them up? She would never hurt them, but I know the men she entertained would. \n\nIn the end, was it mental illness or a survival tactic? I don't think I'll ever know. I'm constantly back and forth. She was the victim, no\u2014\u00a0she was the abuser! I don't fucking know. My moms ashes sit in a box in the closet, my maternal family fucked off once again after I paid the $4,000 cremation fees. All I have is half lies, and I'll probably never know the truth.\n\nIt's like a big portion of my life is told by an unreliable narrator and the last few chapters were ripped from the book, leaving me to try to fill in the spaces. It fucking blows.",

It was traumatic for the whole family. He now lives in a group home and after years of his escalating attacks on us, I breathe easier now. Not long before the last incident, he came at me with a knife and I was positive I would die that day. My only regret is that I didn't step in and call the police years ago.",

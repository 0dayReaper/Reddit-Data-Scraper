    "postText": "When working through emotions I often refer to google, but there is nothing on the entire internet that can relate to the hell that I have endured. I met this man when I was 19 and he was 37/8. I was very liberal, and not at all interested in having or being around children, since I had only recently outgrown that status myself. The second he mentioned being a single dad the night we met, my interest in him waned. I think he sensed that hesitancy though and was so quick to reassure me that it\u2019s no big deal, and that it wouldn\u2019t be anyone\u2019s responsibility but his to care for his son. I was so naive and gullible and unguarded. After having wasted 3 years, during the period in life when I\u2019m supposed to be exploring and experiencing new things, it makes me sick to my stomach. I feel like a parasite has taken vital life force from me. I\u2019m relieved that it\u2019s finally over. \nBut there is just so much to unpack, from my ex\u2019s narcissistic tendencies, controlling over food, lifestyle, appearance, draining me financially when I was receiving Covid unemployment, keeping me in a position where I couldn\u2019t work and was miserably playing the role of step mom out of fear that I could be blamed for the neglect in his household, using my psychological vulnerabilities and past experiences shared in good faith against me to make me question my own sanity and isolate myself. I quit the job I had shortly after I moved in with him due to the sheer exhaustion of adjusting to him and his son and their cargo ship of traumatic baggage. To summarize I felt like I was in a degraded position and an alien in my own life. I wasn\u2019t taking care of myself, felt like I had to constantly prioritize the needs of a child I didn\u2019t want anything to do with, and stopped leaving the house because I couldn\u2019t go anywhere without the kid. \nWhen I look online I see so many things about narcissists preying on single mothers, growing up with narcissistic parents, step-parents, etc. But I don\u2019t see any insight regarding similar situations to mine.  I feel as if I\u2019ve been preyed upon and years of my life stolen. It was truly a prison. \nI tried to leave 4 months in, and many times after, but he always made me feel guilty or like he was the only one who would ever accept me. I moved back in with my mom in February and have been getting back on my feet, but we had still been talking until this past weekend. I was out celebrating my friend\u2019s 22nd birthday in a group. And he used location sharing that he insisted I keep on for safety to follow me to the bar we were at. I blocked him after that.\nI\u2019m kind of venting at this point but I\u2019m just curious if anyone has any similar experiences or advice on how to move on and not feel so tainted by this chapter of my life. I also hope this serves as a warning to any vulnerable young women out there. I was vehemently against the notion of having kids when I met him, and idk maybe I\u2019m just dumb, but the way he convinced me to ignore my gut instinct for three years scares me.\nAnyways thanks for reading this mess and thanks in advance for any advice",

    "postText": "I've been going over this in my head for months now and could really use some advice on what to do. \n\nI started playing soccer my first year in high school. The assistant soccer coach was only a couple years older and unfortunately, I caught feelings for him. I thought they would go away if I ignored them, but they didn't. After the season ended, I was planning on quitting soccer and didn't think I'd ever see him again. But I ended up continuing with soccer, and he continued to help out with the team through high school, meaning I saw him pretty regularly. My feelings never went away. I was one of the better people on the team by my senior year, so I was mostly getting coached by our head coach (the guy I have a crush on mostly coached JV), but I still saw him almost every day at practice. He has a naturally flirty personality, so I used our interactions to make up this narrative in my head that he had feelings for me. I knew he didn't, but I was in denial because I wanted him to like me back.\n\nI graduated high school and went to play D3 soccer in college. Coincidentally enough, he was also playing soccer in college, and due to COVID issues, ended up starting college the same year as me. Since we lived in the same area, we ended up looking at a lot of the same schools. He made the decision of where he was going to school before I made my decision. I ended up deciding to go to the same school because it seemed like the best fit academically, athletically, financially, and with the distance from home. I debated choosing a different school, because I didn't want to be at the same school as him. I knew things would continue to be complicated with my feelings, and I didn't want anyone (myself included) to feel like maybe I was trying to follow him to college. It's a pretty small, rural school, so it kind of makes sense that things would look like that, even though it isn't common knowledge that I like him. One of my friends told me that I shouldn't decide not to go to a school just because of one person, so I took that advice and got onto the team.\n\nThis was our first year at the school together, and unfortunately, my feelings have only grown. We've talked a lot on snapchat and I've learned a lot about him, (not all good things), but it hasn't changed my feelings. The men and women's soccer teams spend a lot of time together, and we would hang out and study together sometimes too (we were in a lot of the same classes), so I saw him a lot during the year. I spent more time with him than I did with almost anyone else this year, partly because both of us had some trouble with transitioning into college and making friends. It's been a bit awkward because we know each other from back home and he was always in a coaching role before, but I've learned that we have a LOT in common (music tastes, religion, hobbies, family stuff, etc.) I've gotten a lot of weird mixed signals from him all year, because it seems like he really likes hanging out and wants to hang out often, and he's asked me questions about what I like in a guy and about previous relationships. He also talks a lot about his ex (I wonder if he might not be over her, but it's been over a year.)  I enjoy my interactions with him a lot and I think he does too... but I haven't gotten any clear signals in regards to if he feels something more for me.\n\nThere have been a tiny thousand moments that make me think maybe he does, but other times, I think things feel way too platonic, and I wonder if I misinterpreted all the tiny moments in my head. He's told me that he doesn't have feelings for anyone at our school and he tells me whenever he's talking to a girl, and he's also told me that he wants to wait until his mental health is better to get into a relationship, and that he never initiates romantic interactions with girls because he's scared of rejection. But he's also talked about wanting to have kids relatively soon, and he's told me a lot of pretty personal things that I don't think he would have told someone he didn't trust.\n\nI thought we got pretty close over the school year, but now it's summer and I haven't seen or talked to him. I've been waiting for him to reach out because I don't want to seem annoying (I feel like I initiate contact more than he does), and I also wanted to see how long it would take him/if he would put in the effort to initiate a conversation. I know he's working like 60 hours per week over summer, and I know there aren't any other girls that he's interested in romantically or hooking up with. I'm planning on reaching out soon, because the silence is starting to get weird. I don't understand why we were close during school but now aren't talking at all. There was nothing that happened between our last interaction and now that should have caused radio silence.\n\nAnyways, all that to say, here's my problem: I've liked this guy for going on 6 years. I've tried SOOOO hard to make my feelings go away. But honestly, he's so great that I feel like I could imagine myself marrying him. I would want that. I have a list of things I want in a guy and he checks every box. Honestly, even though we've never dated, if he asked me to marry him right now, I'd say yes. It doesn't help that a lot of the athletes at my school are dating each other, so it makes it even easier to imagine something happening between us. There's no one else I like, and I've hinted at liking him but nothing clear enough that he would have caught on. I've thought about just telling him how I feel, so that there can be some kind of resolution to this. Meaning that I can a) have a definitive answer regarding his feelings towards me, and b) if he rejects me, hopefully I can FINALLY make my feelings go away.\n\nBUT my problem with this is that we're going to be at the same school for another 3 years, and it's a small school, and our teams operate in very close proximity to each other, meaning that we're going to be seeing each other around and interacting A LOT. \n\nAdditionally, having known him for so long already and after getting closer this year, I really, really value our friendship and absolutely don't want to loose that. I'm scared that if I tell him how I feel, it will ruin or damage the friendship, and make things uncomfortable in any mutual interactions.\n\nI don't know that he'll ever see me in a romantic way, and I think he would feel really weird about anything romantic happening between us due to our past relationship. I also don't think I'm his type physically. \n\nAnother important detail to add is that I have never attempted to flirt with him in any way. In fact, I have made an active attempt to make him think I don't have feelings for him. I've friend-zoned him multiple times (told him what good \"friends\" we are, and I've talked about other guys I think are cute in front of him), because I'm terrified of rejection and I'm also terrified of ruining this friendship. I also have no idea how to even attempt flirting- I have never had anything romantic with anyone before, because I've never wanted anything with anyone but him.\n\nAnyways, in summary, I really want a romantic relationship with him. But I want to be able to keep being friends, probably more-so. I don't want to miss an opportunity to be something more because I was afraid, and it would also make me really sad to see him date someone else. I have absolutely no idea how he feels, and I feel like I'm walking on eggshells trying not to ruin our friendship (that's not something I'm willing to let go of), not make things awkward or uncomfortable between us, and figure out how I should either get over him (nothing I've tried in 5 years has worked), or try to subtly progress things with him.\n\nAny advice would be GREATLY appreciated.",

            "comment": "Okay but honestly what if you\u2019re friendship can just intensify in a relationship. Why does anything have to get ruined? Why not shoot your shot. Life is a roller coaster 100% of the time. Plus friendships doesn\u2019t necessarily last forever the average friendship only last approximately 7 years. \n\nBut if you chase after a relationship with him maybe it could last forever. I say we got one shot of this crazy life why not live it? I just don\u2019t want to live life wondering what could happen. \nThis is your life but I think you want it and you want someone to tell you to do it. I\u2019m that person and I\u2019m telling you I\u2019d rather lose my friend and know it didn\u2019t work out then stay friends and never know. \n\nThey\u2019re will always be people to be friends but if you feel romantic feelings for him go for it.",

I guess I'm just afraid that he won't react well to me telling him I like him, and won't want to be my friend and then I will have lost something valuable and will have wished that I had left well enough alone, you know? Especially since we're currently such a big part of each other's lives- like if I ruin our friendship, I'll still have to see him and face the consequences of that decision every single day.",

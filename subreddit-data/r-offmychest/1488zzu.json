    "postText": "TW: self harm\n\nMy (19F) boyfriend (18M) has a pool and his parents are gone for the week so I went to his house today. I only put my feet in the pool but for the first time since I started dating my boyfriend I wore shorts around him. We have known each other since 8th grade and have been together for 6 months but in the time we have been a couple I have never shown him my right thigh. I struggled with depression back in 2020 and 2021 and throughout 2021 I started self harming. I destroyed my thigh and I regret it to this day. I have been clean since February 2022 but the scars on my leg are still visible and probably will be for the rest of my life. \n\nI no longer feel depressed or suicidal but I am extremely self conscious about my thigh. I have always worn jeans, leggings, pajamas and other clothes around my boyfriend so he would not see the scars but I felt like I was lying to him. It was 88 degrees outside so I decided to wear shorts in front of him and I am so glad I did. He did look once but that was it. He never treated me differently and even said he was thankful that I opened up to wear a pair of shorts around him. I am so blessed to have him in my life. We watched a movie and he was laying in between my legs and he held my thighs and I felt safe. I am very lucky.",

But the only person that ever really notices them are me. Im 49 now and they are now just white scars some thin and some fat and ugly. So don't be afraid to show what you have been through and who are you now. Depression is an illness we dont need to feel ashamed for having an illness.",

Was on lithium and antidepressants,  sleeping pills you know the usual r\u00e9gimen. In and out of hospital.  After a few years I just woke up and decided I didn't want to keep feeling that way.  So i fought back. Now i know what my signs are when i get anxious or low i take time out for myself.  Shut out the world for a day or 2 and just litteraly blob. Its worked for me, not focusing on the negatives always try to find the good even out of the bad. No antidepressants or anything or self harm in 20 years despite going through some pretty extreme shit times.  Lost my brother to suicide a few years before I fell into my depression so i used that as an excuse.  Hes gone we still here living our lives so if I go you all can carry on with out me too. And here we are now losing so many so i try to share my journey and hopefully it may help someone else.",

It was my first time showing that to anyone and I imagined a lot of things... He didn't look happy, of course, but I still remember when he said: \"that's nothing. I don't care for those, it's really small for the love I feel for you. But I do care for what caused it and we should seek out for help\", even though I was 2 months \"clean\". That reaction helped me a lot. I feel it's okay and despite not liking my scars, I don't hate them neither. It's peaceful, it's just me. I am not better or worse than anyone for having this \"details\" but I have to work on it. I guess that's what I needed to hear and probably is what you need too.\n\nI am glad you found each other!",

Which is what I tell tiny curious children when they ask about my scars) \n\nI'll never forget how, 6 months after I stopped and was away from the awful situation that got me so depressed, my grandpa saw my arms for the first time, and they were still so angry and red he cried bc he thought I was still hurting myself. I'd never seen the man show a moment of weakness in my life and I felt soooo bad making my paw cry I stopped hiding them. It was very scary for a long time but I promise it gets so much easier, ESPECIALLY if you have support from loved ones. I don't feel any shame anymore and I'm really proud of you for being brave enough to wear shorts!",

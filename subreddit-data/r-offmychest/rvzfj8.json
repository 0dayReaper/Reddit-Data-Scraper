    "postText": "Well\u2026 I did it I told her. And yeah it was pretty heavy. My heart was even beating fast.  i kept trying to think how to tell her. Many of the comments on my last post here mentioned writing her a letter just how she wrote a letter for me. Originally that was the plan but for me it felt like I needed to say it. \n\nOh,  really quick I wanna say thanks to everyone for their love and support. Mostly to all the birth parents out there who shared their stories with me. That\u2019s what really helped push me to have the courage to confront her. It meant so much so thanks.\n\n\nEverything happened day before yesterday btw.\n\n I did wait for her to be done with her shift and that was when they were closing the restaurant already. And waited in the parking lot. We said hi when she saw me first but then I told her there was something serious that she needed to know. First told her sorry for keeping it from her this long. She didn\u2019t react until I actually pulled out her letter. \n\nAnd she started bawling from there. Like screaming and crying at the same time, and didn\u2019t even have to finish the whole \u201cI\u2019m your son\u201d speech. She just saw it and knew. It was crazy. Next thing I know she\u2019s hugging me instantly but then she pulled back and asked if it\u2019s okay to hug me. Ofc it is and we\u2019re just there hugging an crying in the parking lot. It hit her hard though. Her legs gave out for a second so I had to actually hold her up while she\u2019s still hugging me for a min. \n\nWhat really got me was her saying to me look how big you got. also hearing her cry made me cry too. She went back to open the restaurant up (she wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer) we had coffee, ate a slice of their pie inside and talked. Soooo many stuff we talked about. She told me the second time I came to the restaurant she got a feeling but for her it was hard believe it was me. So that feeling she had was pushed way down. \n\nBecause she told me for years after I was adopted she saw kids that would be my age and used to think they were me. Then she would be crying in public. It fucked with her mind a lot and made her depressed so she didn\u2019t want to do the same when she saw me, getting her hopes up like that. \n\nShe says I look so much like my biological dad when he was younger though. We talked about him too. They stayed in contact with eachother incase I ever reached out to one of them so it would be easier to contact the other. I didn\u2019t have hope about finding my biological dad since he was never mentioned so I\u2019m glad they both planned for this future scenario. She told me about how they wanted to keep me. Especially my biological dad, he didn\u2019t want me to be adopted. But he knew they had to because they were just kids. It took him a long time to get passed it after I was born she told me. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t leave anything because he didn\u2019t wanna believe he might not see me again. \n\nWe talked for hours. Til almost 2 in the morning (they closed at 11). She just wanted to know everything about me but her main thing was \u201cam I happy\u201d. Were my parents good to me. Did I have a happy childhood. And I did. I told her thank you for helping to give me this life. We both cried again. She cried the most. Everything was very emotional for her. Sometimes she would look really happy but then get sad again.\n\nAfter my 18th birthday she was hoping I would find her that\u2019s why she stayed in the same city. But since I didn\u2019t she always thought maybe I resented her, wasn\u2019t told I\u2019m adopted, or maybe had decided it was better not to have her around. It made me feel bad for not telling her sooner. She told me it\u2019s not my fault and I did right going at my own pace. Honestly she\u2019s so sweet. The way she kept looking at me with the biggest smile,  it made me emotional sometimes. Makes you think how can someone who\u2019s been a total stranger ur whole life look at you with so much love. It\u2019s wild. We learned so much about eachother. She asked me if we could have dinner soon to keep talking. And if at some point in the future if I\u2019m interested come over to her house so I can meet her husband. That all sounded really great. \n\nWe exchanged numbers. After I left she sent a text telling me thank you for giving her this gift that she didn\u2019t know if it would ever come. \n\nMy girlfriend came over and she hugged me while I cried. I wasn\u2019t sad btw these were happy tears. Everything went better than I expected. There was still emotionally heavy stuff but I\u2019m still glad that we got to open up to eachother.",

Bio dad lived in home town but everyone kept it under wraps.  Turned 17 and got the whole story, though I kind of had figured it out.  Met him, and he was just, eh.  Like he was happy but I didn't get a great vibe of the person he was so I just kind of loosely stayed in touch.  When I was 32 Was able to contact bio mom for first time.  Nothing but disappointment on that end.  I'm very happy with the life I was given though and the person I've become.  So these stories all hit different and harder.  Very happy for you and hope you can have a great continuing relationship moving forward.",

I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d be able to resist, having something to commiserate the best night of my entire life! I\u2019m obvs a mom if you couldn\u2019t tell. Maybe you could ask your parents to bring photos of themselves from when they were younger and especially your age so you can seen the resemblance! Once again I\u2019m so happy that your parents helped you find her. Was she happy/excited that you had held on to her letter and even brought it with you?

We were in our early 20\u2019s and had no life established yet, too busy being kids wanting to spend money on frivolous things and just be sexual all the time. Reality hit hard when she got pregnant with a little girl.\n\nSo hard in fact that we knew we couldn\u2019t keep her. We went through the adoption process with a wonderful couple living in New York, both very well off. They kept a blog for us for a while but, the ex and I obviously didn\u2019t last too long (she cheated, begged for me back and then I cheated out of spite, awful situation), and they must\u2019ve known because they didn\u2019t keep the blog going for the last couple years.\n\nShe\u2019s gotta be close to 10 now, which is crazy. Crazier still is she was born on my birthday lol.\n\nNow my fianc\u00e9e wants me to essentially establish to her parents that if when she grows up, if she wants to know the truth about me, then she can. It\u2019s scary but your story makes it seem doable.\n\nThank you again, friend.",

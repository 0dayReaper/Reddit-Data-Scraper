    "postText": "English is not my first language so im sorry if there is any mistake and im sorry if this post its too big. For starters I'll call her K, she's my mom's friend and she's known to be to strict and very difficult to deal with but my mom really likes her because they've been friends since they were little so I've known K for a long time and I never cared a lot about her. Last week was my 17th birthday and that was the day everything went wrong, the day started off great with my parents bringing me breakfast in bed and wishing me happy birthday, I knew there would be a party at the end of the day because they know I hate surprises and I'm not very good at going out of plan so we always have a barbecue at night at my house, they call my friends and some family members (we can't invite everyone because we live far from most of our family) and we all eat and have a good time. As my mother likes K a lot, she always invites her because she thinks that if I'm close to K like her I'll understand her better and like her (I think I understood her too much). As it was a weekday I went to school in the morning and everything went normally, until the night arrived and everything was ready, as we have a big house with a pool I told my friends to bring their bathing suits if they wanted. It didn't take long for my friends, relatives, K and her husband to arrive visibly bothered, but I didn't care because I was busier talking to my friends. I was in swimming trunks and a light jacket on top but I took them off when we started swimming, I noticed right away that K stared at me when I took my shirt off, as I'm slightly muscular from basketball, I didn't care too much as I thought I was overthink it. Everything was normal until I went to get myself some juice in the kitchen and saw K and her husband arguing, as I am curious I hid and started listening and with that I found out that K's husband wanted a divorce because he couldn't stand her (I confess I laughed a little but I stopped when I saw that K started to cry), he soon left through the front door leaving K alone in the kitchen crying, I was going to leave too but I think I caught her attention and she saw me, I was embarrassed and said that I was there to get some juice and she asked me if I had heard anything and I replied that I just listened a little. She wiped her tears and left the kitchen without saying another word.\nI went back to the pool and tried to act as normal as i could but I always noticed that K was watching me. When the party ended and my friends left, my parents and I were cleaning up the rest of the mess and putting away the leftover food when K asked my mother if she could sleep in one of the guest rooms at our house that night and she said she was going to ask my dad and since my dad can't say no to my mom (even though he doesn't really like K) he said yes so after we finished packing we got ready to go to sleep. \nI'll explain how my house works, my parents' room is on the first floor, mine is on the second floor as well as the guest room, so it was easy for K to go to my room without being heard. I was almost asleep when I feel someone pushing me lightly, I wake up and startle when I see K, she tells me not to worry and that she just wanted to talk to someone but was too ashamed to talk to my mother because she found it too humiliating , I said fine and listened to her talk about what an asshole her husband is and etc. I confess that I didn't pay much attention because K was extremely close to me and sometimes she hugged me to start crying, in this I confess that I ended up having an erection, and before judging me K is very beautiful, she's just not very nice, I think she is a mixture of Kate Moss and Michelle Pfeiffer, that is, a very beautiful blonde. K noticed and was slightly embarrassed and said, \"I didn't think anyone I would find attractive after what my husband told me.\" I don't know if I felt sorry for her or if I was really horny but I kissed her and she kissed me back, it was my first kiss but I didn't care much because everything was happening so fast and soon we were naked and she asked me if I wanted to to do that and I said yes, so we ended up sleeping together and it was really nice but when I woke up she was gone, I confess I felt kind of sad, but since I had to go to school I didn't have time to care much, when I went down and asked my mother about K and she told me that K had left in the very morning, I nodded and had breakfast normally to arouse suspicion and then I went to school, when I was in class I received some messages but no I could look until recess, only then did I see K's message at that time, and there were like 15 messages, some saying that she liked last night but that it couldn't be repeated but then she says she thinks she likes me to later telling her she would be crazy for liking me, i told her i would do what she wanted, and i ignored her since that day, which hurt a lot because I felt used but also because I think I started to like her. This week I was talking to my best friend and I decided to vent to her about everything and she got very upset and told me that what she did was grooming and pedophilia but I replied to her that I consented but she told me that it was still wrong, but since I don't think what we did was wrong since I consented, I decided to post it here for you guys to help me.\n\nps: I think I'm starting liking her, you call me emotional but she was my first in everything, so I guess its that big of a deal.",

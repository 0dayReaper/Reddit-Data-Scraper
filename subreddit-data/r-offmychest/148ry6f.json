    "postText": "About 6 months ago I started a FWB relationship with a guy friend. We both are in our early 30s, and have had bad experiences with past relationships. We hadn't been friends for super long may be a little less than a year, but we connected, and I thought I could do it. Some back story about me: this was my first time, I am attracted to the guy, and he had made it clear that we were just going to be friends.  \nWe would meet once a week at first, and he would spend the night and chill the next day. We started doing more things with each other and spending more time with each other. He started calling me every few days to where at first maybe would talk for 30 min to an hour then it turned into daily for four hours. It felt like we were becoming so much closer because of this. It felt like we were connecting on a deeper level, at least I thought. He would tell me that I was awesome and one of his best friends.  \nI was tearing myself apart trying to figure out what we were becoming, so I finally told him. I had a very strong feeling that his answer was we are just friends and he doesn't see me that way. He is not ready for anything in that nature, and he thinks starting anything in this manner will eventually have him lose me.  \nI just don't know about anything anymore. I am crushed. I feel like I have to put up some major shields to defend my heart from any future pain. I also just feel like I need to cut myself off from the world. I feel like he is using me, but at the same time I know he does care about me because he checks in to see how I am doing. I have not spent the time since telling him crying, but I did wake up today, without the ability to hold back the tears. It was not so much because he does not feel the same way, but more because I feel like I will always be alone. I just don't think anyone will ever love me or chose me. I put myself out there, but I am at the point that I don't feel like trying anymore.  \nNo advice is needed, but more of sharing an experience so that future women who think they can do this, should guard their hearts as much as they can or not jump in.",

And yes I would agree, getting into a friends with benefits I\u2019d a very risky thing. \n\nI hope you feel better and that you can move on from this, and I\u2019m sure you will find someone who will love you for who you are.",

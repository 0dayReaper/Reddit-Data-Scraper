    "postText": "I (F) was sexually abused for a very long time as a child. It didn\u2019t stop till I was almost 15. I\u2019ve never been able to tell anyone and for the longest time I just pushed it down and ignored it. Until my abuser (who\u2019s also a family member) reached out drunk and attempted to make sexual passes again and my whole life started spiralling. I feel love for this person and it makes me feel sick to my stomach and dirty because how can you love someone who would hurt you like that. I wish I could crawl into a hole and never come out.",

What this person has done to you is no reflection on you or who you are. It\u2019s okay to still love them, they are family and it is natural of you. what they did to you is on them. No matter your actions, you were a child and the responsibility is theirs. I hope you find peace.",

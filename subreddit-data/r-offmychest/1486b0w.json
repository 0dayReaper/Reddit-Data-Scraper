    "postText": "throw away bc some friends follow my main reddit account.\n\nMy ex-boyfriend broke up with me about two weeks ago. We only dated for around a month so it's not like it was for very long. But I miss him. I've been very open about that with my best friends, and people who ask, if i trust them, get an honest answer. He probably knows, too. But I don't really mind. He broke up with me for some obscure reason that I'm trying to fix but it's hard to fix since it was so vague. A couple days ago one of my close friends texted me and asked me if it was okay if she started talking to him. I was tired and the text had woke me up earlier than I wanted to be woken up, so in a confused daze I said sure, I don't care. I'm over him. That's a common lie I tell people who I'm not so close with. Then I really started to regret my decision. They hang out all the time, and I'm constantly getting snaps from her that's pictures of him. Every time I talk to her, she has to slide in the fact that she likes him a lot, and stuff like that. I feel like a shitty person to say that I really hate it. I should've put more thought into my answer, and said no in the nicest way possible. The things I hate most about it is that it hasn't even been a month and my best friend is dating to my ex, and the fact that she knew how much I've missed him. Every time I try to talk to someone about it, I get one of two responses: either I shouldn't feel this way because I already told her yes it was fine and I should be over him by now, or I get told I just need to tell her. I probably do need to tell her, but I'm afraid to lose a friendship. And I'm even more afraid to break apart a relationship that might actually work out, and make both of them happy, which is all I really want atp, even if it means I suffer. I don't know what to do. It's scaring me way more than it should. And I've seen all the stupid revenge toxic tactics, but I don't wanna be toxic, and they don't make me feel any better about myself. I don't wanna get with her exes or his homies. I don't wanna put effort into something like that, because it's not going to solve my problem. I don't need answers, I just needed someone to talk too.\n\nThanks for reading my rant.",

As for the friend, I would stay away for some time and take your own sweet time to recover. It feels like a dagger because it\u2019s your best friend, but it\u2019s not honestly. You should try to hang out with your other friends more.",

There was something going on between them the whole time.  It would be best to cut contact with her.  She doesn\u2019t need to know what\u2019s going on in your life or she\u2019ll try to steal that too.",

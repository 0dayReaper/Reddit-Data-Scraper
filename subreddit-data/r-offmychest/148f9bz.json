    "postText": "I, 21 F started dating a guy (24 M) in January of this year. The very first date, he made a good impression. Good listener, really respectful, etc. Except for one thing. He just seemed so secretive. I even joked about it a couple times after like how secretive he seems that he must already have a girlfriend or something. There were a few red flags over the months we went on dating and I even considered breaking up one month into dating. But on the advice of my friends, I reached the conclusion that I was just paranoid. Three months into dating, I get a text from his ex asking to talk about something. I was curious and ended up talking to her. Lo and behold! He had already been in a relationship with her since last five years. And they even celebrated their anniversary in February (while we were dating). Also, I know this happens to a lot of people but what\u2019s really disturbing for me is the fact is I was a virgin before deciding to finally do it with him. He knew that. So the day we had sex, he had sex with her the very next day while also accidentally revealing to her that he likes me. He\u2019s seriously sick. Like, who does that? Well, long story short, we both confronted him at the same time after finding out about all this. He cursed her and blocked her from all his social media. And kept begging me for forgiveness. I, of course told him to go f*** himself. So now I and his ex girlfriend are good friends.",

It\u2019s unnecessary to do this if what you wanted was more than one person at the same time - the was all to enjoy the secrecy, the lying, the schemes.\n\nThe point, in many ways _is_ the hurt - they\u2019re fully aware of it, and it makes the stakes high and thrilling to be able to have so much power over someone\u2019s emotions like that. If they didn\u2019t care, they wouldn\u2019t bother to lie, and they wouldn\u2019t bother to get emotional when confronted, because they wouldn\u2019t care either way. There is entirely too much effort here for it to be about apathy - it\u2019s about manipulation.",

I can sue him for sexual abuse under my country\u2019s laws since he had sex with me under false premises so that\u2019s fraud. But I didn\u2019t because that would\u2019ve ruined his whole career and his license to practice would\u2019ve been suspended. He\u2019s a doctor. I just wanted nothing to do with him anymore. It was all too exhausting. His girlfriend had a really hard time moving on obviously considering they were almost going to get married at that point. But she\u2019s alright and I\u2019ve never been better. He\u2019s still trying to weasel his way into my life because guess what? He\u2019s extremely lonely, has no friends and nobody is as foolish as I and his ex and wouldn\u2019t wanna date a loser like him. Idk what I was thinking. But all in all, when I look at her I realise how she\u2019s saved me from becoming her five years down the line and I\u2019ve never been more grateful. So it\u2019s a happy ending after all.",

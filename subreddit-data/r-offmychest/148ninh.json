    "postText": "Hi guys, I don\u2019t think any of my friends or family uses Reddit, so I\u2019m posting on my original account. Recently, I\u2019ve been trying to go to college outside the country, because I don\u2019t really like the United States. (Being a minority and all that.) and I wanted to migrate to the UK. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not easy and one of the only easy ways to do this is to get accepted into college there. I did not do good in high school, and I had to drop out of college for a variety of reasons. My grades weren\u2019t the best, so I knew I had to take that into account. But my personal statement was so good, and I thought maybe they would see past it, but no. I\u2019ve gotten four out of five rejections and I am feeling so defeated right now. I\u2019m 24, still live with my mom and I was hoping this would help me feel more like an adult. I just want to leave the United States, but it feels like I\u2019m gonna be here for the rest of my life.",

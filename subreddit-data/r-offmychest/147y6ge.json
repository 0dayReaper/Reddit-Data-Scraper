    "postText": "\n\n\nMy grandpa isn\u2019t abusive, but he hasn\u2019t treated me well in the 5 years I\u2019ve been living near him. His wife has dementia and I\u2019ve been helping him as much as I can. \n\nTwo days ago, he gave me the silent treatment because I fell asleep (due to being tired from work) and forgot to order their dinner for them, so he could go pick it up. \n\nI called as soon as I woke up around 6:15pm, and he hung up &amp; never called me back. Abnormal for him. \n\nThese are just some of the many things he\u2019s done to me, over the last 5 years. \n\nHis biggest fault is telling me to not call him anymore when I go multiple days without calling him. \n\nBecause of this, I decided to just not go to his 85th birthday celebration yesterday. I was too tired and to worn out to put a smile on my face in front of family, and pretend like it was fine.",

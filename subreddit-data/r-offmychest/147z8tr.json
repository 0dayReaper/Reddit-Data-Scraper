That was the last time that I\u2019m getting rejected because I don\u2019t intend on asking anyone out ever again. I always get a no. I am going to sit back and wait for a woman to make the first move. If I end up being single forever because of it so be it.",

Talk to a girl you like and try to get to know her and what she likes. She is not an object to win she is a person just like you that may not like you at first or at all. Have a conversation with her and guage whether you and her have some kind of chemistry, then you ask her out if you do. But remember she might be gay, have a boyfriend or just not looking to connect with anyone at that time. That's her right and you should just respect that. Instead of trying to get a girlfriend first, try actually meeting someone you would enjoy to be around. This girl that rejected you probably would have made you more miserable than being single, trust me it happens.",

Muscles look better when matured of they're kept up with. Wisdom. \n\nI was part of a site that was pretty much the Facebook of sex (FetLife). And it was very interesting coming at it from a journalistic mind point of view. All the guys in their 20s were rarely successful. And all of the women (early 20s) were always after the older men.

It hurts so bad when you put yourself out there and are vulnerable to share your feelings with someone and they don't like you back. However, I would rather have someone be honest with me and how they feel than lead me on. I don't want someone to pretend to have feelings for me to avoid a difficult and maybe awkward conversation (granted there is a right and wrong way to tell someone you do not reciprocate their feelings). The truth of the matter is, not every person is right for every person. Just because you are not compatible with the person you asked out does not mean that there is something terribly wrong with you or that you are a complete loser.\n\nI shared with a really close friend of mine that I had feelings for him and he told me he did not feel the same way. Looking back now, I am so relieved that we did not start dating. We would not have been a good match for each other and both would have ended up getting hurt. That does not mean that I am a loser or that he is a loser, but that we were not compatible together. Rejection definitely hurts, but try not to take it too personally. Many of us have been there!",

I was watching some motivation video, and it changed my view on it. \n\nBasically , get together with your friends and every rejection that you get, celebrate it, laugh at it, and just learn from it. The rejection will have its reasons. Maybe they're taken already. Maybe they aren't interested in a relationship, whatever. But it's not focusing on the fact you got rejected but celebrating that you asked someone you thought was cool out, and that's ballsy and awesome. Take the rejection and be proud of it before moving on. \n\nMaybe they aren't interested now, but they definitely know you're interested, and if they ever change their mind, they will know they have a shot with you.\n\nHopefully, you can get back on the horse and find the partner of your dreams out there, man,\n\nBest of luck",

So if a person doesn\u2019t wanna date you from the early stages where you make it known that\u2019s what you want, move on and take ownership of the things you can. You can\u2019t force people to be interested in you. Maybe also do things to make yourself more interesting. Get some hobbies, do something physical, travel and makes some good memories/stories, take care of your looks, work on your personality (it is something that can be worked on, \ud83d\udcaf) etc. get that chip off your shoulder and put in some hard work on yourself.",

Waiting for a girl to approach you seems like the only way out without further damaging your self esteem.\n\nI know how this sounds, but I\u2019m going to tell you why this isn\u2019t the best way to deal with it. \n\nSee, I want to point out that this decision in and of itself is a huge hit to your self confidence. You\u2019ve given up. Plain and simple. That doesn\u2019t feel good. I think you should feel good about yourself for having the guts to even try. You\u2019ve basically decided you don\u2019t have the guts anymore. You can\u2019t tell me that makes you feel any better about yourself. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to shame you, I\u2019m only pointing this out to you, because your heads in a really bad space. But if you give up, doesn\u2019t that mean that you already chose rejection for every girl you don\u2019t ask out? I\u2019m saying, what if you notice that a girl actually might like you. And you think to yourself \u2018man I could ask her out i think. but i shouldn\u2019t tho because what if she says no, like every other girl i\u2019ve asked out?\u2019 are you gonna just not ask her out because of the possibility that your self esteem gets hurt again? If you thought yes to this question, I want to highlight the paradox of this situation; your self esteem is already at it\u2019s lowest when it comes to dating. You\u2019ve literally given up. You\u2019ve got nothing to lose dude. If you ask her out and she says no, it\u2019s as expected, right? \n\nI read that you\u2019re in your 30s in a comment of yours. I don\u2019t see how this changes much of anything at all. \n\nPlease take every word i\u2019ve typed for you to heart. I meant every one of them.

You should be fairly confident it's not going to give indigestion or a burnt tongue before you go for it. Same goes for courting people.\n\n We sometimes see people who can just go up and with all the charm and good looks one would need and still fail, and when they do succeed it's because of all the times you don't see where they failed. You're sore. I get it. That's a sign that you need take a break. Stop pressuring yourself.\n\n To help imagine them taking a shit or doing something embarrassing... You'll feel less intimidated. You'll level the playing field.. and come off less desperate. People want to feel protected, supported, not like you'll be a chore... well most people. And most of all, BE someone you'd want to date. Is your hygiene good, do you maintain you body, take care of your finances? You don't have to smell like expensive cologne, super fit, or be rich.. but you at least need to be someone who cares about themselves; somone responsible.. accountable. Because if don't care for yourself, how are you going to take care of them?. You can find people who are just as self-apathic, but they typically aren't going be your first choice or someone you'd want to be with long term. \n\nIf all else fails, I've heard of restraining your sexual urges for a week or so, then finishing off as soon as possible before you make any decisions... helps clear the mind. And reveals your truest desires. If you still feel something then it's probably not just lust. Knowing this will give you more of an advantage because you know, you know. And that confidence is enough to get you through it without coming off as a desperate loser. \n\nIf you still have your Vcard, and your over a less than comfortable age, then I suggest taking the first chance you get to lose it. Sex is great and all, but your first time is way overrated. Get it out of the way so it's no longer over your head, or just remove it all together. You'll kick yourself for how dumb you were being. \n\nTldr; don't put too much pressure on yourself.. just work on being a better person than you were yesterday and love will find you.",

Anyone with any sense of stranger danger would say no to this, regardless of how handsome the person asking is. It makes them feel watched and the whole thing feels blind/one sided.

It's how the learning process of dating goes and there's no way around it.\n\nYou don't need to avoid ever getting rejected again... what you need is to train yourself to receive rejection with grace and maintain composure. And the best way to do that (from my own experience) is to deliver the date question... kind of as an afterthought.\n\nHere's the scenario: You're involved in a conversation with your crush about whatever. When the conversation is winding down, say, \"Well, I got a few things I need to get done tonight and I need to take off, but you wanna meet up for coffee or something tomorrow?\" Receive your answer. Calmly bow out of the conversation (even and ESPECIALLY if the answer is yes). *And then actually leave! Yes, even if they said yes. Leave at once, as soon as you set up the time and place for the date.*\n\nWhat this says about you is that you have other things going on in your life besides trying to get into their pants. It reduces any worries or suspicions of creepiness to practically nothing. It also says that you are interested and that you are available, but you're not obsessing.\n\nYou will definitely *NOT* be rejected every time. I guarantee it! Go get 'em, dude! You got this!!",

You could have the most fantastic girl (or boy, or whatever you\u2019re into) approach you with all the right moves, compliments, intimacy, the works, and you won\u2019t be able to appreciate her. Yea, sure, you\u2019ll be smitten for a week, but at the end of the day humans are incapable of appreciating something they get for free. Remember your last meal at that expensive restaurant? I bet you do. How about your latest inhale of air? Didn\u2019t think so. As to rejection, your heart is a muscle. Rejection is just early stage of working out. Every time it makes you a little stronger, until you realize that your value and self-worth are not defined by lack of interest from one individual. Or 10. Once you get to feeling that, there won\u2019t be any lack of interest, I promise you that.",

I have noticed that some people socialise/interact with the intention of finding someone (date), it's unfortunate because with such a mentality they are more likely to end up disappointed when things don't align with their expectations.\n\nThings are much easier when you interact to have fun and enjoy yourself. Those who come along and click with you will come but it's meaningless to rush to process. Look for friendships and not potential mates, it will do you a favour. I would recommend befriending people you are compatible with, those that got similar values and views to that of your own, similar hobbies but with some differences that can set you apart, if you don't want to hang out with \"clones\". If you are introverted, befriend fellow introverts, if you are extroverted then try befriending other extroverts. Are you geeky? Befriend geeky people like you. Into sports? Get yourself people who are into that etc. Just don't expect to date someone, just build your social circle and surround yourself with compatible people. You will likely find someone who finds you attractive. There is a chance the friends you make will introduce you to someone else, maybe that someone else ends up being compatible with you and a good match at that. Remember, looks fade and all that truly matters is your mind and what is underneath the surface. Learn to respect yourself and don't mind being alone with yourself, things will feel less heavy that way. \n\nI read you wrote you were in your 30s, let me tell you this, people in their 30s are still young and you will probably think of yourself as an infant once you are in your late 50s or early 60s. It happens. Your experience is not going to be the end of the world, learn to accept yourself and work on yourself, not to please others but for you to be satisfied with your improvements and overall growth.",

            "comment": "Asking women for their number is like a muscle. Initially, it's unpleasant. It hurts to get rejected. And that fear of rejection causes you not to ask in the first place. But over time, as you do so again and again, you will find it to become easier and easier. \n\nI used to struggle greatly with asking girls for their number. To the point that if I was interested in a girl I'd wait days for the right opportunity and usually in a conversation with her. Today, if I see a girl I like and I don't come up and talk to her I get unpleasant. Today, what bothers me is women that give their number but are not serious.\n\nLike lifting weights, once 25 pounds becomes easy, you have to increase that weight. \n\nJust tell yourself this. What am I afraid of happening if I ask her? That she'll reject me. And why am I afraid of getting rejected? Because nothing will ever happen between us. But if I don't ask her, nothing will ever happen. And the longer I wait, the harder it will be. If I ask her, there is a high chance I'll get a no and nothing will happen. If I don't ask her, there's a 100 percent chance nothing will happen. \n\nBefore I met my 2nd GF (basically ex), I had gotten rejected on many, many occasions. All those rejections were more than compensated with the almost year and a half we were together, all the love we shared, dinners at her family's home, and vacations down to Florida together. \n\nGo out there and ask away!",

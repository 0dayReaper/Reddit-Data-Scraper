    "postText": "Hi all, not really a reddit poster or anything, randomly got a notification for this reddit and thought I would get something off my own chest.\n\nI am 23, live with friends and work full time ( being made redundant end of this month and receive my final check the first week of July ), I have a gambling addiction and I relapsed when I was paid on the 09/06/23.\n\nI\u2019m not here to ask for sympathy, it\u2019s my addiction and I should have learnt from my past but now I am struck with suicidal thoughts and the pit of embarrassment and fear for the next month of my life.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I will financially pay for food and fuel for the next month, there is one or two small things I can pawn but that gets me likely max $50. I have no one to turn to or no one to loan money from.\n\nIf anyone has advice on how i can make money trees spawn out of thin air that would be immaculate.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m sure that not many will read this but I\u2019d appreciate a support comment if you do.\n\nCheers.",

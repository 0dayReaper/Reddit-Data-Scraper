    "postText": "Today is an opportunity to be a leader. You have to start looking at yourself as a leader. As a leader you no longer have the option to take the easy path in life. It can be very lonely. Through your actions you can change the mindset of those around you. You must do when you don\u2019t want to do. You have to find your best self when you\u2019re the least motivated.",

My own mother responded with \"oh, a girl?\" and a friend from work said a slightly underhanded comment that he thought I was eyeing up another (male) co-worker. \n\nI'm not exactly offended that people thought this about me but I don't really understand what it was about me that made everyone (including my mother) think that I was gay.

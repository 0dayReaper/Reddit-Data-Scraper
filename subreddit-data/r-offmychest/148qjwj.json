    "postText": "This keeps happening and it makes me so angry I just wanna pull my hair out and punch everything I see GOD \n\nI just got 'scolded' for the most random ass thing. I swear I remember my mom buying me a box of fucking tampons for the first time a few months ago, i tried 2 times dont really like it but I still keep it, I was talking to my mom like 10 minutes ago and tampons got brought up and I said oh yea I did try them 2 times and then I got scolded because apparently she never bought them for me and I should have told her qhen I frist tried them and shit like that. I'm not angry about the fact she was worried about me because tampons aren't the best thing and I know its often recommended to try them at the latent age possible but I'm angry about the fact she doesnt REMEMBER THAT SHE BOUGHT THEM. This isn't even the first time it's happened and it makes me so angry because she told me I didnt buy them for you but like wtf yes you did and I pass for a liar or somebody that doesn't remember anything but like YOU bought them. And then she said I didnt buy them or else I would have probably gotten them in a smaller size but I swear shes the one who fucking bought the goshdarn tampons and why AM i so angry about tampons gosh I fucking hate this and  even more She was saying like oh and then can cause an infection and I told her I know and she told me you know everything huh? I told her no I dont know everything but I know this since they've you know.. been teaching me this shit for 3 years AND shes the fucking one who told me that to BEGIN with. I love my mom but I can't help but get so angry.",

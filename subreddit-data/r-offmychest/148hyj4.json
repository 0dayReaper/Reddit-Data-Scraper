    "postText": "I've been with my partner for 8+ years happily together no splits and very few fights and disagreements. We are soulmates in my eyes. \n\nYet as of recent he has just stopped being the man I love. He hasnt really changed any of his behaviors and it's more that he hasn't changed that's bothering me. I'm a chronically I'll person with an aggressive auto immune disorder. He helped me sign up for a new exprimental therapy and has supported me in enrolling hoping this will help some of my symptoms like chronic ulticaria, low white blood cell count, ibs, alopecia. You name it. The doctors toting a lot of change on it and essentially I'm working up to monthly transfusions/infusions that require a week recovery afterwords. This month I had first transfusion last week and my partner didn't even take off of work. Wished me luck and then seem surprised when I asked if he was coming. He said no and he booked me a hotel local and would pay for my Ubers confused I drove to my hotel by the treatment center leave my car there ubered to my treatment ubered back stayed alone two days shivering and reacting terribly and then shakily drove myself home Wednesday last week. The 45 minute drive home took me 3 1/2 hours with all the breaks I needed. \n\nThis weekend was my partners birthday and I told him I couldn't do much but let me know what he wanted to do and I would try my hardest. He told me both his parents had parties planned one a lunch one a dinner and we were leaving Saturday at 10 am. I was a little surprised as he swears every year will be the last of him letting them do this to him because he hates these gatherings. As a child of divorce it's a major competition and his father is incredibly abusive and manipulative so we are low contact as of last year. He told me he expected me to go and if I really couldn't it would be fine. Knowing his parents it would not be fine so I sucked it up and attended. His dad only tried to pull my mask off three times which is a win and otherwise it was fine except for the car ride home where my partner decided to start speeding and slamming on the breaks. Normally I drive but I'm still so weak I couldn't and in doing this and whipping my head several times my vertigo was triggered. \n\nI have been dizzy and throwing up uncontrollably all Sunday, Monday, and today. Yesterday he worked from home and took care of me a bit but this morning he woke up and I asked him to get me some more water as I couldn't move and he told me he couldn't he had to get ready for the office. I said oh you can't work remote today? And he told me no it's my routine Tuesday - Thursday in office and Tuesday he will b going to the work gym and Thursday attending jujutsu with his routine. I told him I'm really sick and if I keep being sick like this I ne d to go to urgent care and his response was Uber and try not to need to and he got ready and left. I texted him at work saying on your way home can you stop to get me some more brown rice and apple sauce and his response was \"I went to the grocery yesterday\". \n\nI love that he has a routine and I love our routine together but the past week has me questioning all of that. He can work remote any time he needs it and pays for the gym and jujitsu classes individually every week so there's no obligations just his mental routine. I haven't showered in a week because I can't do it alone and he's been robotic in his routine. The apartment is a mess. Everything smells like vomit and diarrhea. I don't want to be gross and I know it's objectively all caused by me but I'm begining to resent him just for his lack of willingness to shift routine in any way that could help me. My appointment last week was 6:30 pm. He is off work at 5 he could have driven me and brought me home and instead he spent money keeping me alone and away and since getting back it's just been no consideration.",

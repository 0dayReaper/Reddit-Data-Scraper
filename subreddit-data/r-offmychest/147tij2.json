    "postText": "Since I was a kid my dream job was a mom. My family was probably disappointed because I\u2019m pretty smart (straight a\u2019s took very little effort in school, I just didn\u2019t see the point) and had a good job in the navy, but because I didn\u2019t even want that as my job, I messed it up by marrying a man who I thought was perfect but was actually abusive and technically was already dating someone (and continued dating them for nearly a full year of our \u201crelationship\u201d) \n\nMy best friend finally knocked some sense into me and I left. Around the same time I left, I was discharged from the military. This triggered the worst manic episode I ever had (I was diagnosed with bipolar) and I used sex as self harm. Looking back now I feel bad for using guys but in the moment I just thought it\u2019s what everyone did.\n\nWell, I started to get close to one of the guys, one of my friends from the military, and I caught feelings. I also learned i was pregnant. He was the only one I was sleeping with at this point so I knew it was his. Both of those facts scared me so much I distanced myself from him. I didn\u2019t even tell him until 12 weeks. I called my family and broke down, scared to be a single mom cause I assumed he didn\u2019t want a kid. They moved me back home on the other side of the country. \n\nI fell into a deep depression because I felt alone, and because I was back where most of my trauma happened. The only thing that kept me going was my daughter.\n\nA week after she was born her dad called me and begged for me to come back. He said he wanted both of us in his life and he came to take us home. Since then he has spoiled both of us. \n\nWhen I thought of being a sahm when I was little it was always as a rich person in a fancy house. In reality we are barely above the poverty line and have roommates. And I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. We have enough money to survive plus have an occasional treat, her dad (we are officially dating now) is about to start his own business plus just got a better paying job, and our roommates also have kids about the same age as my daughter who we all take care of together. I have a small business so if there\u2019s anything extra I want to get I can, but there isn\u2019t much else I want. \n\nIn high school i would say I don\u2019t wanna be happy, just content. When I\u2019m snuggled between my daughter and her dad I think about how I got what I wanted.",

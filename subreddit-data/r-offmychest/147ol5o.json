    "postText": "I just... Have to tell it somebody.  \nWe\u2019re married for 25 years, and I was a SAH wife and mother all through of it. We have two kids (10f and 8m) \nI'm 44 and my husband is 52.\nI'm depended on him in every way possible, and he abuse it. I get used to take out condom wrappers from his pockets before laundry, or his blatant lies of \u201covertime\u201d and \u201cbusiness trips\u201d. I always thought that I have my kids, and when they are adults, I can divorce him, and move back to my home country (or anywhere in Europe) so I was relatively happy.  \nA year ago I got diagnosed with breast cancer, and I needed a double mastectomy. After the diagnosis, he refused even to touch me. After the mastectomy, he got even more disgusted. I wear a wig all the time, because he thinks in hilarious with my bald head.   \n\nI met with Fran (36f) in a support group half a year ago. She's a cancer survivor, and moved to this area recently. We became really good friends, with same interests... It was nice to have a friend, nice to have someone to chat, who knows what chemo feels like, and not just feeling sorry for me...  \nA week ago my FIL died, and my husband took the kids and flight there last Tuesday. We had a big fight, because I couldn't go with them. He was angry at me, but I had a chemo treatment in Wednesday (I had a treatment every 3 weeks)  \nFran offered to take me to and from the hospital, and she insisted that she's help me after and refused to leave.  \nThis was the first time someone helped me. Most of the time, we have a nanny to take care of the kids while I'm suffering and puking upstairs alone. And the first few hours after is hellish. She helped me change after I had an accident, held the bucket, tucked me in. She even took off my wig, when I got sweaty, and told me that I'm beautiful without it...  \nShe stayed the night and cooked for me the next day. She constantly praised me and reassured me. She let me cry on her shoulder. At the evening she offered me a joint to help with my appetite.  \nWe had so much fun, laughed hard, watched a funny movie, and ate junk food. I made a joke about my expense (me being cut up) and she almost scolded to stop degrading myself. One thing let to another, and we made out in the living room, and I fell asleep in top of her.  \nActually she was the one who stopped me to do more, because I was under the influence.  \nFriday she had to go back to her office, and in the first few hours, a was extremely happy. I felt beautiful. Desireable. But the adrenaline wore off, and now I can't even look in the mirror.  \nI can't stop hating myself. I clinged to my children when day arrived at Sunday, I skipped the group meeting, and I'm avoiding Fran.  \nI hate myself so much.  \n\nThank you for listening.",

Should she need permission from her parents to start that until some age? If her parents are dead, does she have a way to get permission via the courts. \n\nKind of a slippery slope, isn't it?

Follow up, why didnt all those men wanting pure chaste barely legal girls (even though plenty have had sex in High school) also get married early?

From dad to husband, just change the title owner? \n\nIts never about wanting purity. Its insecurity of wondering if youre not as good at sex as her ex and ease of control. Plenty of good women with low numbers that are their own age- just not as easy to pretend they own. But they do try with women their age. They just get left for being dicks. Wild.",

I also don't think them being good now necessarily means it was also somehow the best decision because there's plenty of single people of different ages they could have very likely dated happily instead. And it also could have been really beneficial for the younger person to have experienced life more instead of feeling the need to settle down ASAP because of the age of their partner\n\nI'm not saying massive age gaps never work out. But I think people excusing them because they didn't end up like dumpster fires is kinda silly because thats assuming there's only one person you can ever be happy with and that the younger person wouldn't have been happy also getting to have more freedom/experience while they are at their mostly peak health years. \n\nIn general I think people should mostly leave others to their own age groups (especially those in their teenage years and early 20s) as its allows people to mostly develop at their own pace rather than thrust into the role of being a presumably equal partner of someone at a very different point in their life",

Its really easy for someone who's a lot older and more experienced/established to manipulate them by providing them perceived stability and \"maturity\" as guiding factors during a period where they are still finding themselves \n\nNot saying young people shouldn't have any agency or be allowed to explore their feelings.

I\u2019ve been cheated on- I, like most others, *despise* cheating, however I have never thought of her as a cheater given the situation she was in. She had nothing and nobody else, no college education, 19 years old, halfway across the country from where she grew up, no financial access/control, and literally scared for her life. \n\nAlso, she went home and confessed to not only that, but that she smoked some weed. Her ex couldn\u2019t deal with the fact she had smoked a joint- to him it made her a hippie, dirty, immoral, a junkie, etc.- ironic considering his addiction to alcohol, but that\u2019s legal. He ended up leaving her. It was more about the weed than the other guy which blows my mind. \n\nSo while I still abhor cheating, as I\u2019ve gotten older I\u2019ve realized more and more just how not black and white life is.

He got a girlfriend there and tried desperately to make me jealous. Obviously planned his breaks around mine, etc. I didn't let it bother me and eventually moved on and left him there to hopefully wonder wtf he was doing. I went to work at a women's clothing store where no men worked after that, and then moved to a different town. The only thing that saved me was the threat of homelessness. Only then was I able to convince him to let me have a job too. As soon as I got contact with the outside world I was clawing my way out. \nThis mf had convinced me that my car was irreparable. He told me he sugared my tank. When I moved my stuff out and moved my car it was discovered that he'd only disconnected the battery. I'm still pissed. I could have ran so much sooner if I'd known literally anything about cars. But I was young and got trapped straight out of high school. People often don't understand unless they've been there.",

He tried to divorce, she pleaded no for the kids. He said he would stay (because he liked their marriage otherwise) but he wasn't going back to the cult or the lifestyle. She does not approve, or want, him to sleep with other people. But her cult beliefs tell her that he's allowed to take multiple wives in the afterlife if he wants, so she has to deal with it. So she just asks that he hide it and it's a don't ask don't tell policy. They're neighbors and one day she unexpectedly came over to borrow something when he happened to be here and... it was not discussed or acknowledged but she had to know and it was uncomfortable. Idk.

            "comment": "\n\nHey, I'm sorry to hear about everything you've been going through. I also deal with cancer, and I wanted to share something my psychologist once said to me: Cancer can sometimes serve as a wake-up call, indicating that there may be aspects of your life that you've been neglecting. From reading your story, it seems like you may have been neglecting your own needs in order to prioritize the happiness of your husband and kids.\n\nIn my own experience, I also neglected myself due to the abuse I suffered from both of my narcissistic parents. I had a doormat personality, and people took advantage of me. I wasn't valued, and no one acknowledged the sacrifices I made. When I reached a point where I finally noticed I received no love and felt like my life was slipping away, I became infuriated. I made a decision: either people had to change how they treated me, or they had to leave.\n\nThose who chose to leave (such as my mother, aunts, uncles, and cousins) are no longer part of my life. I no longer care about or contact them. Those who remained were required to change their behavior towards me, or else I would distance myself from them. As a result, those who regretted their mistreatment made significant changes to make amends for their past behavior.\n\nHowever, it took a lot of effort, energy, and boundary-setting on my part. I demanded to be respected and acknowledged. Today, I am much happier and no longer allow myself to be taken advantage of. Unfortunately, people tend to appreciate us more when we love ourselves, set boundaries, and demand respect. Do not be afraid to stand up for yourself because no one else will do it for you.\n\nYou deserve to be happy, loved, appreciated, and cared for. I strongly suggest investing in your new life and considering leaving your husband behind. It appears that he has already shown a lack of empathy and love for you. Your kids will be okay, and in fact, they may be better off without a toxic father who mistreats their mother. Children don't like seeing their mother suffer, and they suffer along with her. They may not understand why you haven't set boundaries or defended yourself.\n\nSeeking legal assistance would be a good idea. You have shown incredible strength, and you don't need your husband in your life. However, it's important to seek advice from professionals who can fully understand your situation and provide personalized guidance. They can help you navigate the complexities of your circumstances and **make decisions that prioritize your well-being.**",

By having affairs himself without you consenting to that, he had already broken any contract and freed you from any obligation to keep up your end of that promise. \n\nFurthermore, as I sense that he took the time and made use of the past 25 years to impose his worldview on you as you were much younger than he when you got married: Pleas, for your own sake, question the moral rules he taught you, question the role he made up for you. \n\nAnd lastly, I feel so happy for you that after all this time there is somebody who sees you and wants you to feel better.

Let\u2019s be honest, this marriage only exists on paper. He cheats all the time, he doesn\u2019t even hide it, so see it as him opening the \u201erelationship\u201c. Why shouldn\u2019t you be happy? Talk to her what she thinks about it and how she feels about you. What is this to her? And give it a shot. Maybe you\u2019ll fall in love with each other deeply and eventually be able to leave your husband to be with her. Document everything he\u2019s doing or not doing, his absence, how often he\u2019s gone, how often does he do something with the kids, talk to a lawyer what you can do. Get your ducks in a row, you have enough time whilst he\u2019s gone. Sounds like you have someone by your side who would help you go through this. She sounds amazing and you deserve to be treated the way she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s time to think about yourself and your kids. Please don\u2019t forget that you show them how life works and how relationships look like. Think about what you teach them right now. And if this is really what you want them to learn, to be ok with being treated like that or to treat someone like that. Do you want to teach them that this is what \u201elove\u201c looks like? Plus, please keep in mind that your children can\u2019t be happy when you\u2019re not. Kids know and sense more than adults think, so they do know what\u2019s going on within your marriage. You deserve to be loved, desired, cared for, .. Give it a chance, give her the chance to do that for you.",

Regardless of what happens with Fran, you are emotionally done with your your husband.   There is no future together.   Talk to a lawyer about what steps you should be taking right now.\n\nOnce you are separated and independent with the divorce in the works, you can pursue a relationship with Fran or not and you won't need to hate yourself for it.\n\nRegardless let Fran know you need some time to get yourself together and you have some really big decisions you need to make on your own.   So you aren't ghosting her.\n\nDon't hate yourself, but do use this as motivation to propel yourself forward.   You can't stay as you are now.\n\nDon't stay together for the sake of the kids.   They will do better spending time separately with each of their happy parents then will together with two parents who are unhappy and resentful.",

I wish my mother had the courage to do the same. \n\nShe was married to my dad for 32 years - despite him cheating on her on their wedding day, having a kid with her cousin's ex wife, not coming to either my brother's or my birth, almost giving her syphillis while pregnant with me , having a picture of another woman that \"flew into his pocket\" while she was pregnant with my brother and the fact that he beat the shit out of her for a year straight after moving us to a foreign country. She left him only when he started hinting at SA-ing me. \n\nLeave him, my love. You have a chance to be with someone who actually respects you and sees you for you. My mother always taught me that beauty is in the eyes, because not only are they the window to the soul, but they're the only part of us that doesn't age. I'm sure your eyes are beautiful, because your soul definitely is. And I'm sure no matter what cancer treatment has done to you, you're still beautiful on the outside too. \n\nYou deserve so much better \ud83d\udc9b\n\nI wish you all the health, happiness and love in the world. If you need any extra love and support while you're debating all of this, I'm a DM away.\n\nETA: Like a lot of others have said, definitely gather all the evidence you can. If you have anyone that you've spoken to about the abuse as it happened, please try to get them to be a witness for you if it's needed in the divorce.",

Obviously, you've got challenges, kids, and a dependency on your husband financially.  If you can't simply leave him, you should be careful, but as you are fighting for your life, it seems like you now have a reason, more than ever to fight to live.  Passion and desire are strong motivators.  Be careful and take care of yourself and forgive yourself for being human.  Your needs aren't met at home and you certainly haven't asked for much.",

    "postText": "Hey, I need some help. \r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m struggling a lot with a situation and I want to know what it seems like I should take from what was said to me so I can be clearer in my head about it as I\u2019m overthinking like crazy. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSo my boyfriend and I had been together for 2 years. I love him with all my heart. And up until recently I thought he did too. The other day I went to his place and he broke up with me. He is saying that he does still love me and that\u2019s why this is so hard, but that his head is f\\*cked up and he needs to be on his own for a bit, that he needs time/space. I was there for hours and he spent a lot of the time hugging/holding me and he cried which I have never seen him do before. He also initiated kissing me on the head and lips and initiated saying 1 or 2 of the I love you\u2019s. He said that \u201csometimes feelings fade\u201d, \u201cthings have felt different lately\u201d, \u201cwe don\u2019t do much\u201d, \u201cit feels like we\u2019re stuck in a rut\u201d, \u201cwe can still be friends\u201d, \u201cmaybe one day we can try again, you never know what the future holds\u201d and these things are making me question his feelings &amp; chance of return. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nBut he said he does still love me- I asked if was the same way he loves a friend and he said it\u2019s more than that. I asked if it was because of my appearance, he said no and that I look good. I asked if he likes someone else and he said no. I said I was worried he\u2019d meet someone cooler at a gig or something and he said \u201cwho? Name?\u201d (name being one of his friends who he\u2019s definitely not romantically interested in that he goes to gigs to). \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nHe said that his messages were open and I said I would feel too annoying messaging him knowing he needs space, and to that he said \u201cI\u2019ll probably check in in a few weeks\u201d and \u201cI won\u2019t be gone forever\u201d. I said I was worried he\u2019d forget about me and he said he wouldn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t give any kind of time frame. I asked if he was only upset because I was upset and he said no. At one point he said \u201cI think we can be together again after and that it will be okay\u201d. I asked if that was what he wanted and he said yes. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI said to please be really clear with me and to not give any false hope because this could be our last interaction for months and all I have to go off in my head for reassurance. He originally misinterpreted it as me saying this is the only like affection I\u2019d get for months and he sounded somewhat offended and said \u201cyou don\u2019t think you could wait?\u201d \r  \n\r  \nSo am I waiting? Is it a break or a break up? Ahh I\u2019m so confused \ud83d\ude2d\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nHe insisted he\u2019s not giving me false hope and he\u2019s being 100% honest. His autism does make him very honest, sometimes to the point of saying quite blunt things, but he also said he hated seeing me so upset so I am worried he might have been saying these things so that I wouldn\u2019t be as upset. The thing is, both of our mental healths have been bad lately. My anxiety has prevented me from seeing him much/leaving the house the past couple months. He has also been quite depressed. I asked about what he would do in this time and he said probably go back on his anti depressants and try get a job. This made me motivated to try get better and be able to go out and do things so I can be better for him when/if he comes back and we can go on more dates together, which I said to him. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe \u201cmaybe one days\u201d that were also said seem that he is quite uncertain and like us getting together again is a lot more abstract but then other things he said spark a bit more hope. I keep thinking about what he said because it seems like it all contradicts each other. It was an emotional goodbye. He said that he would miss me. He wanted to walk me out but I said I would start crying again so it\u2019s okay. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s now been 5ish days and it has certainly been 5 days of hell and agonising over all my different \u201cunderstandings\u201d of what\u2019s going on which change by the hour. I know that he has still been going out to gigs with friends and their houses, and that makes me think he must be having a great time and maybe he isn\u2019t depressed and it\u2019s just me that\u2019s depressing? And I start thinking that why would he leave me if he did love me? If he loved me enough wouldn\u2019t he want to try to work through it instead of leaving? And how he could be so okay with cutting contact (for now?) cold turkey after so long together when it is destroying me? How much time do you think I should wait if he doesn\u2019t message me til I message him again? \r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m scared that by not seeing me he\u2019s just gonna forget about me and realise how much better life is without me :(",

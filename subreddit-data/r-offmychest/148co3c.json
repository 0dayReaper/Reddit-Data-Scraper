Nothing gets better. Cutting doesn\u2019t even help anymore, I just feel so sick and he\u2019s gonna know if I tell somebody and he told me not to tell anyone",

Please, please speak out to anyone you think you could trust enough - guidance counsellor, student wellbeing staff, etc., just someone. Take every day a single second or minute at a time if you have to, and please know that as much as it may not feel like it now, you can and will feel safe and happy again with the right help.",

    "postText": "I feel guilty for feeling this way, because part of it is I just don't want to talk to him about anything besides surface level shit because I'm afraid he's just going to yell or belittle me for my feelings. I just don't feel like I'm allowed to be unhappy.\n\nI'm not allowed to be unhappy about the bullshit \"poly\" relationship we had for 7 years, where I got nothing until the very end when he said he wouldn't accept me dating men and was terrified of me actually falling in love. What the fuck am I supposed to get out of this??? A man who can't keep a job more than a year? A man who just LOOOOVES to brag he \"knows what he's doing in bed\", when the reality is I fake it so hard because my emotional needs have never been met?\n\nI'm not allowed to be unhappy about his hoarder, senior friend who moved into our house and just started piling her shit on our back patio?\n\nI'm not allowed to be unhappy that my poor kitty is starting to show her age and most likely means that she will probably be passing in the next five years?\n\nI'm not allowed to be unhappy I feel like I can't have friends because all I can do is cry or start blankly into space anymore? I don't want to bring others down. \n\nI'm not allowed to feel unhappy that I feel like a waste of space? That I don't feel sexy and fun like those porn girls you follow on instagram? That all I'm good for is the \"responsibilities\"?\n\nI'm tired. It feels like 90% of people who talk to me do so because they want something from me. Thank fucking christ I don't have kids, I can only imagine the damage I would do to them mentally for being like this.",

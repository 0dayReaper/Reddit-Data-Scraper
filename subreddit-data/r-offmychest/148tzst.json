    "postText": "My boss and his wife bring their kids (12ish and 6) to work every day since school let out for the summer. They also bring their high energy dog (herding breed) who doesn\u2019t have any respect for boundaries and jumps on everyone. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a traditional office. Everyone works out of a home, so only my boss has an \u201coffice.\u201d There are only a couple of desks for designated people. Everyone else just has to find a random spot elsewhere to work. Meaning there\u2019s really no way to get away from the dog or the kids since we\u2019re all in common areas, and they naturally don\u2019t stay somewhere away from everyone. \n\nAnd they\u2019ll both often leave the office and leave their dog behind or leave the kids unattended for the rest of us to deal with while trying to work (so they can work in peace). \n\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong for feeling like this, but it\u2019s really annoying having to work in an environment with kids. Especially when no one has a private office or anything. I\u2019m significantly less productive compared to the days when I get to WFH because there\u2019s just so much going on, it\u2019s distracting. \n\nMaybe we shouldn\u2019t bring whole families to work?",

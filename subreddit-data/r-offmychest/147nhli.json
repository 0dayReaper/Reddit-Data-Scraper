I was drinking 4 bottles of wine a night just up until a month ago.\n\nJust wanted to share that I'm doing well, though &amp; hope anyone out can listen to what they know - it gets better after a few weeks once you quit.",

When you go in a store, avoid the beer/wine aisle, or just avert your eyes so you don't look at those products as you walk down that aisle - this was a HUGE help to me. Get therapy or go to AA/SMART if you haven't yet, or at least consider it and ask for help when your need it. Most importantly, as cheesy as it sounds, \"one day at a time\" works. Don't worry about tomorrow, focus on today. I'm 5 years sober and it's so hard at first, but it gets easier. You can do this!",

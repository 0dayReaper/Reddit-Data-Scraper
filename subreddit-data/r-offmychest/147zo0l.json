    "postText": "Myself has never been good enough. Myself is loud, myself unintentionally interrupts people, myself can be impulsive, annoying, etc. Myself is the person nobody wants to be around. \n\nMyself has never been able to keep a solid friendship. Friends always leave. They are good people - they aren't \"the wrong crowd\"\n\nI'm the wrong one. I can't figure out how to socialize. I don't understand what I have been doing wrong my entire life, but being myself isn't the answer. Myself just isn't right. \n\nIf I try to focus on not talking too much, asking questions to get to know people, etc, like really focus on \"being a good friend\" it doesnt work either. \n\nIdk what is wrong with me, but myself isn't enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: I hope this does not come across as suicidal. I am not. I do have family who loves me. Just no friends. I always lose friends. It hurts and I'm tired of it. I wish I could fix myself so I will no longer be lonely.",

The mindsets and mantras and medication management and frameworks I've built for myself.\n\nI can't promise you what worked for me will work for you.  But I can talk you through how I came up with my process and my conclusions and see if that's helpful for you.",

I try not to interrupt people when I get excited- but my friends don't mind and I usually say, sorry, got excited, I really do want to know what you're talking about!\nDon't forget that everyone can better themself too.. instead of be yourself, work on being the best version of yourself. Improve something  just one percent at a time.\nIf you're open to it, try talking to a therapist..\nYou could also be depressed, or socially anxious.. \nI have ADHD and social anxiety and I have learned to deal with it over the years in different ways.. some routines, sometimes lots of coffee, sometimes medication, sometimes.. just practice. \nHang in there!! Life has its shitty phases!\n\u2665\ufe0f",

As a working adult in a typical 9-5, making friends is so hard. I was diagnosed with adhd after college. I just wish I realized I had all these issues when I was younger and maybe I could have started working on it and actually had friends. \n\nI just feel like no matter how hard I try to improve myself, to everyone else I'm just an annoying person not worthy of their time. It's so frustrating I'm trying so f*ing hard to better myself but I'll never be good enough",

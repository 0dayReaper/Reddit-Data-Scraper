    "postText": "Wow guys, I don't even know where to begin. I am honestly so grateful for all the support, advice, beautiful messages and awards you guys have gifted.\n\n I wish I could personally thank each and everyone of you, and I did try my best to reply to every message. \n\nYou guys are honestly so amazing and I cried reading all the comments, my heart has never been so touched with the ammount of love and support I got on this post and I am so sorry if it took too long to post an update. \n\nI was honestly in so much shock I didn't know how to cope with it. \n\n\nSo uh I never got back to my ex, I didn't know what to do, but eventually he must have given my phone number to my parents as they texted asking to meet up. I never replied and was planning on organising a zoom meeting but didn't need to as they also showed up at my door. Well my father did.\n\nWhen I answered the door and saw him standing there, I ended up throwing up which he insisted on cleaning. \n\nWhen he was done, we sat down and I just bursted in tears. \n\nMy emotions were all over the place and my father has worn the same cologne for a really long time, so when I smelt it, it just bought back all these memories. \n\nHe tried to hug me but I pushed him away and asked what he was doing here. \n\nHe went on to explain he and my mother are getting a divorce. He said he begged my mother to get in touch with me the minute I left, but she refused and said I was acting like a baby and if I wanted to leave them after doing something so horrible, then I could do things on my own from then on. \n\nI askes him how long did it take them to notice I was gone. \n\nHe said they arrived back home after News Years Eve and were planning on inviting me over so we could talk, that's when they got in touch with my friend and she told them I left and she didn't know where I was. \n\nI asked him why didn't he listen to my side of the story and why did they throw me away so easily. \n\nHe just started crying. He said he never meant for things to get so out of hand and he wishes more than anything he could take it all back. \n\nI said when they found out Nicky was taking drugs and had dropped out of HS, they didn't throw her away, instead we all went on a holiday so she could focus on things besides drugs and during that trip, she got hooked on alcohol and each time they defended her over and over. \n\nHe said he had no idea my mother was going to kick me out, he thought it was going to be for a few days but then they decided last minute to spend Christmas out of state. \n\nMy mother apparently promised him I would be allowed back home after they got back. \n\nI said she threw away all my stuff but he said everything was still there and she lied about that.  \n\nI asked him what has happened to Nicky and he said she is dead to him, he wants nothing to do with her but my mother has been crying to him, asking to forgive Nicky as she is not well and they had already lost one daughter, they cannot lose two. \n\nHe blocked my mother and Nicky and has been on my ex's case about finding me. My ex caved in when my dad said he blocked my mother and Nicky and told him where I lived. \n\nI asked that he never show up again unless I give him permission and he agreed. \n\nHe asked what would happen now and I said I really don't know and that he hurt me really bad. \n\nI then just went into detail about how much he hurt me and what it felt like seeing them so happy without me and how hard it is has been. \n\nWe were both crying by the end of it but I was really glad I got it all out, it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. \n\nMy dad then said he knew a few places around the area and would help get me a better apartment and he said he would help get a better job but I told him I wouldn't be leaving this job as my boss helped me out so much and I wanted to repay him at all costs. \n\nI said I didn't want him to do anything for me, but I said I do want to reconcile but it has to be on my own terms and It is going to take a very very long time to trust him again, and I may never trust him again. \n\nHe said he would do anything to make up for what he did. \n\nI asked him why Nicky did this and if she said anything about it. Well she said she thought my ex deserved better than me and she wanted to see him happy because he was making too many sacrifices in the relationship, she loved him like a brother and wanted to break the engagement off, so that night she asked her friend to come and escort me out of the club so she could get photos and to take me home so her plan could work, she said nothing sexual happened, I went to sleep on the sofa and that was it, he was up playing video games all night until I woke up, which he has prove of apparently. \n\n\nMy dad was planning on getting my stuff from my mothers house and bringing it to me but I told him I didn't want those things anymore. \n\nI then went to ask about Nicky's husband and he said my mother has been hush hush with the entire situation but he had his number and wrote it down for me. \n\nAfter my dad left, I decided to call Nicky's husband.\n\nI was sweating the entire time and felt so sick, what if I could hear her in the background? \n\nWell anyhow when he picked up, I just spit everything out, which I deeply regret because I should have eased into it for him, he sounded really confused and I explained the entire situation again. I even went into detail about her drug and alcohol problems. \n\nI was honestly expecting him to curse me out and defend Nicky, instead he let out a long sigh and well turns out, he had a feeling she wasn't exactly innocent, turns out her and his sister have been having problems and she has been spouting non stop lies about his sister and has caused a huge rift between them, his sister didn't even attend their wedding. \n\nI told him I was sorry but he should make things right with his sister because Nicky was the problem not her. \n\nWe spoke a little more and he hung up. I'm not entirly sure what he is going to do with that information, I hope he cuts his loses and leaves her because he sounded like a really nice person and even he has lost his own sister because of Nicky. \n\nSo I have decided to reconcile with my dad, My mother has always run the show their entire marriage, so the fact he is putting his foot down and divorcing her and going nc with Nicky shows he is serious about wanting to make amends. \n\nI don't think I will ever reconcile with my mother, as she thinks Nicky is a victim also in all this and at this point I don't care to listen to her excuses. If she reaches out and we talk, I will update the post again. \n\nFor my ex, I haven't had the time to meet with him and talk, though my dad mentioned he wanted to come with my dad but he told him I would be too overwhelmed if both were there and seeing them separated will help make clear decisions. \n\nHe also mentioned my ex was arrested for assaulting Nicky's friend who lied about the entire situation, he was being charged but the charges were dropped a few days later. \n\nI will update the post again, when I have have time to speak to my ex. \n\nThank you guys for your being so patient and so caring and just amazing.",

Likely why she will defend her indefensible behavior. There also might be some deeply rooted jealously toward OP from both Nicky and their mother.

This was purely a selfish act. \n\nHe didn't get mad or assault' the guy or w.e (when he knew exactly who it was) when he thought you cheated on him  , which would've still been a crime but would've been more  understandable as he took you from him due to this incident etc. \n\nHe assaulted him TWO YEARS or whatever later when he found out the truth and felt like he was made a mug out of. When his ego was bruised and realized he'd fucked up, he then took it out on the people involved. \n\nI'm not saying violence is ever the answer- it's not, but if he is capable of violent acts towards the person 'who helped decieve him' YEARS LATER  why wasn't he capable of the same acts on the 'guy who slept with his fianc\u00e9' at the time ?? You know the thing that most people would be more  emotional and quick to anger about? \nThe simple answer is he was happy to believe the story, you being the bad guy/ the instagator of the situation. He was happy to cut you out his life when he felt he was in the right, but once his pride was bruised and realized he was wrong he attacked the guy and tries to contact you, to appease his own guilt....to try and stop feeling bad about what he done. This is purely an act of trying to stop feeling like a bad person/ the guilty party In his own head and 0% about you/ wanting you in his life/ wanting you back \n\n\nKeep the ex an ex, forgive him if you must but keep him away. You'll find that once he's had the forgiveness, the validation his character is looking for, that he stops chasing you and lets you live your life. Because it's not about still loving you, it's more about hating himself for what he did/ potientally him loving the idea of you but not you yourself. You've grown, you've become someone you weren't before. He doesn't know you anymore, and you don't know him. You've all grown and changed ALOT due to this instance and TBF due to your ages and your drastic change of life and circumstance. \n\nHe doesn't know your friends, your work, your hobby's, your likes or dislikes, your political views, your needs, your desires, your goals etc etc. \nHe knows what the old you was, and is in love with the idea of going back to a time where you were both happy together...where *most importantly* he wasn't at all to  blame for anything, ***where he felt no guilt***",

Not just a little tipsy, drugged, which - if I remember correctly - she tried to explain to them, but they would not listen. Even if something sexual were to happen that night, it would have been sexual assault! She was unable to walk on her own, she could not have given proper consent... but the ex was quick to dismiss any of this.\n\nOP, my dear, I am so sorry that this has happened to you, but if (or when) you choose to meet the ex, please keep in mind that a real partner, with enough empathy to be in a healthy relationship, would have at least LISTENED to you when you tried to explain the situation. Then, once they heard you were likely drugged they would have been worried about you. Sexual assault is not cheating, any human being with a brain can realise that. Regardless that nothing of the sort happened that night, your ex choose to not listen, choose to ignore you, and now he again as wildcharmander1992 says choose his own ego by beating up the dude. Beating him up at the time when - given he actually listened to you - sexual assault was on the table... yeah, that maybe could have been justified, not in the court of law, but public opinion. Now this only means that he is mad he was made a fool and ruined his life. The fun part is, he made the decisions that lead him down this path, and he could have chosen from a plethora of different choices. Given that he deliberately gave you zero chance to explain yourself, I would personally not talk to him or hear him out, but the decision is yours. I admire your strenght in this situation.\n\nEDIT: a typo",

However the fact that he didn\u2019t properly let her voice her story or even hear her out to fit the missing gaps was his fault. I can only assume he was very hurt in the moment which makes your thought process change. You can say he should believe his wife no matter what, but being in the scenario is a different case.

Your Ex and Father have already found you so your Sister and Mother could find you too. Your Sister is extremely good at planning revenge, and knows people willing to help her (think of her friend who set you up in the first place, because I bet there are more guys like him that she knows).\n\nPlease consider how to PROTECT yourself in the future.

Your sister Nicky and her friend just casually ruined your life because\u2026 she felt like it?? That sounds like insanity to me. If I were in your shoes I would never forgive her no matter what. On the other hand your mother is a difficult case. Me and my mother are very close so if she did something similar to your situation I would feel very betrayed, but I wouldn\u2019t hate her and would be open to forgiveness ONLY IF she is serious about it and makes the first move. Forgive but never forget! However your mother seems to genuinely not want to reconcile so I can\u2019t speak on that matter. Your father seems genuinely sad about what happened and seems like he actually cares for you even tho he betrayed your trust. Forgiving him could help you and your father to work it out, but nobody would blame you if you decided to not forgive him. Your ex fianc\u00e9 is also a difficult case. As your fianc\u00e9 he is supposed to believe your innocence unless you\u2019re proven guilty. Even then I would try to find out the truth myself if I was your fianc\u00e9 instead of blindly believing your sister. Again nobody would blame you if you didn\u2019t forgive him. \n\nThis is just a shitty situation in general and I hope you can bounce back from this! I will definitely be waiting for the next update. After all these bad things surely good things must come. Never give up!",

But from a logical standout, I think the right thing to do is to be done with her. It\u2019s one thing to react the way she did at the time, it\u2019s another thing to be in complete denial about Nicky\u2019s actions. She\u2019s clearly the favourite child and she\u2019s proven it.

This is a cop-out.  It's not taking responsibility.  It's like he was an unwitting victim of your mother who just didn't know any better.  He was okay with leaving for Christmas after kicking you out. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!  The decision to go along with doing that is 100% on him.  He should own it. \n\nIt sounds as if he's apologizing here, but with a bad a case of victimitis.  For real change he should own that he knew what it would mean to you, and did it anyway.  This is not about rubbing his nose in a mistake.  It's about true ownership of his actions, and true contrition.\n\nI'm so glad things are moving improving with your dad, and also so glad you are holding your ground.  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWith respect to your job, I'm glad that you aren't relying on your father for anything, and would not move jobs based on him.

Investing your time in that job is a good thing, as long as it is working for you too.  \n\nLoyalty to your boss is a good thing, but it should be balanced with loyalty to yourself.  It's important to put your life goals first.  Moving on to something better is not disloyal.  It is a part of a life that moves forward.  \n\nThat said, it sounds like there are opportunities for advancement without leaving your job.  But if not, it sounds like your manager might be the type of person who would probably help you, and not hold you back. \n\nCongrats again!!!",

But do it slow, because he \"begged your mom to call you as soon as you left the house\" but he didn't need permission, could've just do it (at least behind her back). Glad he is divorcing your mom and going NC with Nicky, but still, he was part of it all in the moment he didn't defend you or let you tell your side of the story in two years. In that time you could've been dead and he wouldn't know. \n\nAbout your ex, he was worrier about you cheating and didn't even saw the \ud83d\udea9s when Nicky saw a man with you while you were drunk and she didn't care about your safety, only took a picture, and the fact that, in case something would've happened, you were raped. (This applies to everyone involve too, in 2 years not a single person questioned that?). \n\nI suggest that if you want to forgive your ex, have a cordial relation only, don't get back with him. You don't deserve the kind of husband that leaves you in the street like that. Besides, you're going to remember this bad episode whenever you're with him. That relationship is over.\n\nYou didn't say much about your other sisters, family, in laws, etc, but the fact that they didn't help your father and ex to reach out for you, but when it was about giving you the cold shoulders they were on board, is not a good sign. \n\nI hope Nicky's husband divorces her and makes things rigth with his sister, because Nicky and your mother doesn't deserve anything good in life and shouldn't be able to destroy another family.\n\nPlease give us an update when you feel is convenient. I'm sending my best wishes for you, and I assure you everything is going to be better from now on.",

I wouldnt be able to forgive or trust him. Def don't forgive fiance. The person that's supposed to be your life partner should give you the benefit of the doubt rather than believing the person that drugged you. He also assaulted the dude that he was dumb enough to believe. He's demonstrated that he takes responsibility for his actions by physically attacking people. He's a lost cause. Hoping nickis husband leaves her and she and your mom are miserable for the rest of their shitty lives. Consider suing, but if you're not emotionally prepared for that and just want to forget about the whole thing, then wish them nothing but the worst and move on. Wishing you all the best \u2764",

An explanation of to why he could drop you so easily despite the convincing evidence is due imo, and also was there real love in the relationship if he was able to cut you off so quickly? An in-depth conversation between you both sounds like it could answer some questions and help you get a better understanding. \n\nYour dad I pity truly, especially if during the marriage your mother was more or less being a bit vindictive and controlling in their marriage.

Everything should be on your own terms as you take your power and welcome those who you deem worthy back into your life as you see fit.\n\nYou do not need to chase your mother.

Perhaps him explaining himself and you elaborating the way it made you feel would be a positive step for you and your reconciliation. \n\nI am not sure what your mindset is in regard to a future with your former fianc\u00e9 in relationship terms, but it seems before this incident arose you were what they would call a \u2018perfect team\u2019.

Keep your head clear. It's good that he wants divorce and tries. But trust is built slowly.\n\nAs for your ex fianc\u00e9. Well, he should just stay ex. If you find it difficult to trust your father again (which you have every right to do) then I believe that it must be even worse with him. After all, we marry people we love and trust, to live together, you know, stuff like that. You might that you will give him a chance, see if he really changed but it won't be that easy. Every time you will look at him you will remember the betrayal and the pain he caused you. He can try to make amends but he will get tried of always being the one who has to apologize or every time you need space. You two would be miserable. You need trust to have a relationship. I don't think it's worth it. You deserve so much better than someone who wasn't even concerned when he was told you were drugged and probably assaulted. Ex stays ex.\n\nI would stay completely no contact with mother and sister. End of discussion. I see you wanted to meet them on Zoom, and at the beginning I also thought that you should meet them somehow you so you could call them out and get this chapter closed. But I don't think it's necessary. I think you shouldn't contact with them at all. At least with Nicky. They don't deserve to talk with you. I am very petty person and sometimes I have this feeling of wanting my revenge, but sometimes we have to step back. It's not worth it. They don't deserve to see you, they don't deserve your time, show them that by ignoring them. I saw people here saying that you should sue Nicky for drugging you. Of course you can do that but I think you need strong evidence for that. But I'd you really want to do something with that case then maybe contact a lawyer and ask they how they see that case. It's up to you.\n\nI really don't get Nicky's husband. So he suspected something, lost contact with his sister because of Nicky and still married this enormous walking red flag.",

    "postText": "I want to write this down here.  \nI consume alcohol and weed regularily  \n\n\nI want to start off with the hyprocisy that's going on this wide topic.  \nAnd I'm gonna start with adressing this:  \nA lot of people say that you should stop (for example drinking), because you can feel just as good when sober.\n\nOk now I've realised that this is not true. If you mean joy, of course.   \nOf course you can experience happiness and joy without drugs... lol  \nBut you can not feel the same effect the drug gives you when sober, unless you're very experienced with techniques that stimulate the production of certain substances in the body.\n\nBut anyways, no you can not get tipsy or drunk without consuming alcohol, you can not feel the same way without it.  \nSame goes for weed or any other drug. You will only feel that way, when consuming that.\n\nNow it's up to anyone to keep on using drugs to have these experiences.  \nOf course there is this point where the bad effects (usually effects on your health and your actions)  \nwill become too strong and most people will consider taking less or pausing.\n\nBut drugs like weed and alcohol are not the ultimate killers of your health and well being.  \nThere are many other things which are much worse.  \nFor example obesity, depression, lack of exercise, unhealthy diets etc..\n\nThe usual pinnacle of the bad side of drugs is the addiction itself.  \nMost people who consume weed, alcohol... will obviously tell you that there's nothing wrong if you don't overdo it. I agree.  \nUntil that point where you clearly overdo it or the drug has damaged you to an extend where you feel like it would be wise to change something, I see no reason to stop.\n\nThe problem is the addiction. It's a mental situation, I find it hard to guess the right balance, I find it hard to realise when to stop. Do I want to stop, but the addiction makes me feel like it's okay to keep going?\n\nNow I wanna talk about people who have their consumption under control or don't take these drugs at all.\n\nI think a lot of these people either have a very strong mind, have a lot of other joyful activities, their mindset works completely different... Or they have never taken the drug at all.\n\nI feel like the addiction starts right away when you take the drug for the first time...  \nEverything after that is... well.. either do or don't.\n\nShould I stop taking the drug even though it's giving me life quality?  \nA lot of people will now feel eager to write on their phone or keyboard \"Life quality? Drugs don't give you life quality.\"\n\nI'm sorry, please read what I wrote earlier again that you can not get the good feeling of the drug unless you take it.. Please read again what I wrote earlier before writing a quick comment.\n\nSo yes, if we're talking about alcohol or weed for most people that does give them a good feeling, a feeling unique of that drug and feeling good is part of life quality.   \nWell.. I don't really feel like I should stop consuming, when it's clearly making my life feel better, of course me being a healthy person, I don't have health problems so the drug is not fucking me up, at least not right now.. lol\n\nAnd yes if it was that easy I would change my life, mostly talking about the things I do (activities etc)\n\nPeople feel like it's very helpful to advice stuff like:\n\nWell go traveling, go hiking, go to a nice restaurant, do this do that  \n... Usually a lot of these things include money, a lot of money even  \nAnd no I can not magically get a very well paying job and no it's not like I'm just so up to get super educated/qualified to get that super nice job.. and it's also not that easy... lol\n\nBut still, if you feel like it, please give me some advice or share your thoughts on the matter.  \nPlease refrain from writing a toxic comment, straight bashful comment or a quick comment when you didn't even read half this. \n\nAnd have a nice... year.. not just day lol See you around  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n",

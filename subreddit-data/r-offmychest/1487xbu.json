    "postText": "I am surviving on 4 to 5 hrs sleep. I am dating sort of and it feels good enough to stay awake and not sleep. The work is heavy. Listening to my mum's rants is sucking the life out of me. I just want to be alone, sleep well, watch a movie and figure out how to deal with this. I don't want to hurt either of them but figure out a way to have some time for myself and hoping this doesn't affect me professionally or individually.\nHow to balance between this rush of dopamine and the constant fear of savouring it before it runs out and the regret that I didn't enjoy it when I still had the means? Or being kind to my mother hoping I don't regret my behaviour in the future?",

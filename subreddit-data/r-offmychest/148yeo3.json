    "postText": "I think I've become a more anxious and unhappy person. \n\nIt's my first relationship ever. I'm constantly worried that he'll change his mind or that he feels differently about me. That I like him more. That I'm too much, that I'm not enough.\n\nHe's gone often and frequently for work, and we talk every day. I carry most of the conversation and I don't really mind because he works a lot of hours. He's tired. Sometimes he doesn't pay attention to what I'm saying or just doesn't try to keep it going at all, and I try my best to be understanding. I do.\n\nIt's hard to be in a relationship when one half of it is gone and both people aren't exactly the most amazing conversationalists.\n\nWhen he is home it's very nice. He makes me happy, and I love him. Sometimes even then I wish he would put in more effort or consider me more often. But I think that's unfair of me. Just because I put him before me doesn't mean he has to do the same.\n\nHe says he feels so taken care of and I'm so happy I can do that for him, but what about me? I want to be taken care of. I asked him how he doesn't feel insecure all the time and he says he just feels so loved. I want to be sated, does that mean I'm too much? \n\nI just wish I had lower needs or just didn't care but I feel like that's antithetical to how I want to be loved. \n\nI just wish I wasn't so consumed by this all the time. I wish my overly anxious brain could think about other things. I wasn't doing great before I was with him but I feel like my head wasn't so screwy. I felt more even I guess.\n\nI don't think I should be in a relationship, but i do love him and i don't want to break up, even though I think it would probably be better for me. Ugh I'm so over my busted brain. I realize I sound so overwhelming and neurotic. I really try to temper these thoughts.",

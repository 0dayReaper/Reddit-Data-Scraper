    "postText": "I was raped in March of this year. The whole thing is fucked. He didn\u2019t get punished. Nothing happened to him. I tried to report it and was basically laughed out of the police station. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how things work sweetie, we can\u2019t do anything about it\u201d \n\nNow it\u2019s November. I\u2019m in therapy, the kind that\u2019s free because It\u2019s through a rape crisis counseling center. I love my therapist, she\u2019s helping me a lot. Really. \n\nBut I woke up yesterday seething. Nothing happened to him. Nothing. He still works as a worship leader at his church. He\u2019s still dating the pastors daughter. He gets to exist exactly as he did before. \n\nI want revenge. Stupid fucking idiot, I still have the screenshots of him basically admitting it to me. I have the screenshot of when he threatened to kill himself, the picture of him at a train track that he posted to a private Snapchat story where I was the only one added. He manipulated me. He made me think I had caused someone to kill themselves. It was just to make me feel bad for him. To make sure I didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nI\u2019m going to post the screenshots on Instagram. And I\u2019m going to tag everyone he fucking knows. His mom, his sisters, his girlfriend with the pastor father. I\u2019m gonna do it on Thanksgiving too, because FUCK HIM. \n\nThe police won\u2019t do anything, fine. At least the people in his life will know he\u2019s a rapist. And if they don\u2019t believe it, at least it will always be in the back of their minds. I\u2019ll plant the seed, and wait for it to grow. Idgaf. \n\nHe ruined me. He ruined the way I interact with people, he ruined my relationship with my male friends, he ruined my relationship with my dad. Because I can\u2019t trust anyone anymore. \n\nI want revenge, and I plan on getting it.",

I should write a paper on this if I decide to do psychology work. I really want to know why they think it\u2019s OK to rape someone? No means no, regardless!! Even if someone is drunk and passed out that\u2019s not an open invitation to have sex! No means No! Period! We all learned what no means growing up. I really am puzzled as to why Rapists and Child Molesters think what they do is normal or ok. Then they try and blame the victim, or make their victim feel sorry for them. Quite sickening really! Again, I\u2019m sorry this happened to you and my rambling. I hope you can recover from what this ass hat did to you and yes wreck his life, he destroyed your innocence and you didn\u2019t deserve that. This is not your fault and please remember to remind yourself you did nothing wrong. What he did is wrong, he\u2019s the predator and the sick bastard whose reputation should be destroyed by all accounts. Stay strong and I\u2019m hoping you get your life back or at least do your best to put back the pieces of your life this ass hole stole from you!",

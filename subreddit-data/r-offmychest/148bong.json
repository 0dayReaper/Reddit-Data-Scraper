    "postText": "So, my whole life I\u2019ve had a torn relationship with my daughter.  I struggled with drug addiction, anxiety, and depression.  I\u2019ve been in and out of her life since she was a child.  Usually her Mom would realize I\u2019m using or I\u2019d disappear for a couple months, then I\u2019d go years without seeing her. When I was there, there was no better feeling.  But when I went without her, it felt worse then death.  The last time I spoke to my daughter was September 2017.  We went to my nephews birthday party, I thought we had a really good time, then I drove her home and dropped her off.  She was 11 years old at the time.  I called to speak with her, her mother answered and said she doesn\u2019t want to talk to me.  I got a story that she was thinking about when I wasn\u2019t there and decided she didn\u2019t want to talk to me for now. I sent my daughter a few emails and spoke with her Mom a few more times, then weeks turned to months, then years, and here we are now. \nNow she\u2019s 17 and she\u2019s been asking my Mom about me. She says she wants to start talking to me again, but she doesn\u2019t want it to seem awkward. This was yesterday. I\u2019ve been having terrible anxiety ever since.  I\u2019ve been off drugs and taking prescribed methadone ever since January 2018.  I don\u2019t work, have a few small health issues, and feel like I\u2019m anything but a roll model right now. I literally have nothing to offer her. I haven\u2019t even seen my own family in years because I pretty much just gave up on life. I do nothing all day and feel like a piece of crap.  But I\u2019ve found comfort in giving up. My point is that I\u2019m anything but a good roll model right now.  She has an amazing life, she\u2019s happy and healthy, she\u2019s smart and beautiful. She has a lot of friends and a Mom and Stepdad who love her and take care of her. \nWhat good can I do her at this point? I signed away my rights and let her Stepdad adopt her because I was tired of failing her.  I love her more then anything in the world, but I\u2019m no good for her.. \nwhat do I do? I know no one can tell me, but I had to dump all this out somewhere. Of course my Mom is pushing me to get in touch with her, but I can\u2019t tell my Mom all of this. I feel like I\u2019m backed into a corner! \nAny help or advice would be very helpful. Sorry if nothing makes sense, I\u2019m not very good at this. Ask anything you\u2019d like to.",

You can be honest and tell her about why you left and what you\u2019ve been through. She\u2019s old enough to understand.\n\nNot to be mean, but she can see your situation as a possible outcome of addiction and then try to make better choices for her life.",

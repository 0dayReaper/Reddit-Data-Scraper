I know that\u2019s stupid, but why? Why? Why?? How? The same exact flight with seats right next to each other. \nI met this person when I was 15. He was in his 30s. He was a mentor of a school program. The situation was unfortunately textbook, and I don\u2019t think I need to explain the rest. \nI almost turned around and walked off the plane. \nWhen I realized it was him, I just walked to the back of the plane and explained to the flight attendant and she let me swap seats with another passenger quietly. She was discreet and calm. I thanked her profusely after the flight. \nI sat in a seat temporarily and this family was so annoyed I was in their seat. Mini rant, you never know what people are going through. Maybe they\u2019re stupid and can\u2019t read a seating chart or maybe they\u2019re trying to escape their abuser. \nI have so many mixed emotions. Every time I thought about this man I felt sick to my stomach. Mortified and the worst part was I blamed myself. Strangely seeing him\u2026I felt that blame lifted. He should have known not to do that. I began to shake when I saw him, but for the most part I tried my best to stay calm. And i choked on some tears but I didn\u2019t not cry. I feel some sense of relief and closure\u2026.is that weird? I just\u2026I don\u2019t want to be the one who\u2019s life is affected bc of something a pathetic old man did to me. I have an amazing life today. Stable job, incredible partner, loving family. Fuck that guy. He doesn\u2019t deserve any more space in my mind. \nI also felt like a bit of a coward for switching seats, but there\u2019s no reason I need to face this person. He didn\u2019t deserve to sit next to me. He doesn\u2019t deserve to be anywhere near me.",

I've seen multiple of my abusers in public, and each time my stomach feels like it physically flips. I struggle not to flee, vomit, and diarrhea all at once :(\n\n\nLuckily, I've only *actually* run into one of them once, and was surprisingly able to keep my head, and act in a way to keep myself and my-at the time toddler-daughter safe. Which was probably the reason I was able to do that...because she was with me, and I always act in a way that maximizes her safety, and that man was a child predator, who specifically impregnated underage me against my will in order to make me bear him a daughter even younger than myself that looked like me for him to abuse. And my daughter is the spitting image of me. (Sorry for the trauma dump, lol).\n\n\nIt is empowering when a past abuser no longer has any hold on you.\n\n\nRemember. The opposite of love is not Hate. It is indifference \u2764",

That is mortifying and your daughter is so lucky to have a momma bear to protect her.\nThat\u2019s so true. I hadn\u2019t considered the possibility the flight attendant didn\u2019t believe me and wouldn\u2019t let me change seats. There could have been a whole commotion. I was thinking how unlucky I was, but I was lucky to have support and understanding in that situation\n\nBut yes so true! Being able to let it go is a win. It felt so weird to want to let go of this dark cloud that has followed me throughout my life. I thought I was denying my past or brushing it off. But I just don\u2019t want to be tormented by something that wasn\u2019t my fault anymore",

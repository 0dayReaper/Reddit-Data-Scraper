But honestly one day you just have to do something. \n\nEven if it\u2019s painting and going selling them at the local farmers markets. Going to trade school and becoming a plumber or going to college for business and running a company. \n\nYou\u2019re at a good spot where your life is blank. Just start somewhere. Like maybe going on walks for 20 minutes a day then, writing in a journal or even reading one book per month. \n\nJust start something small then finish it. It make take you all year but put in some effort to do something you want. Not all achievements get you medals. But if finishing a puzzle or 3D model car gives you some feeling of accomplishment that\u2019s something. \n\nJust look at the small things because the small things make up the big things because who knows you could eventually complete in a puzzle  competition. \n\nJust do you.",

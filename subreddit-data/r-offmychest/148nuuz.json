Any step you can take in the direction you want to go in life is worth it no matter how small. \n\nYou can\u2019t play it safe all the time. Take a risk every now then. Stay open minded. \n\nDreams and desires can also change.",

I don\u2019t deserve to accept just average after what I have gone through honestly. \n\nI\u2019m talking about things that seem impossible. Being a billionaire, the most successful person on the planet, the most loved and most beautiful person on the planet, having my celebrity crush as mine, getting paid for doing what I love, traveling the world, being fluent like a native in a different language, being a master at drawing and painting, working with luxury brands as an influencer, and so many more.",

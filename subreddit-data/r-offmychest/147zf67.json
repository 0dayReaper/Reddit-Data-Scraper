She\u2019s stringing you along with the reaching out hedging her bets if this new guy fucks her a few times and then throws her away, she can go back \u201chome\u201d.  Did she break up with you?  It\u2019s rarely mutual. If so, all the more reason to stop contact entirely. Due to the quick turnaround, I will least give her that she was ethical enough to break up with you before sleeping with somebody else. But this should give you a clue that you\u2019re always gonna be her second choice and if you back down, she will always walk all over you. Don\u2019t become her friend, if you get fired from a job you don\u2019t continue to work there part time. Otherwise you\u2019ll just be another Simp in the bullpen. I would respond back once to say I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea that we continue to contact each other and to please respect your privacy. I know it hurts my man, if you need somebody to talk to, please reach out to me. Men need to learn to support each other, because nobody else gives a fuck about us.",

There's nothing I could say that would make this not hurt, but I think in time you too will come to not give a shit about what your ex felt at the time of your break up, whether she loved you or it was all a lie.. because she'll no longer matter to you and so whatever she thought or didn't think at any point in time would be of 0 influence on you.",

Any many have real feelings for her they are hiding hoping one day she\u2019ll come around.  Not even saying she was cheating per se while with you, they are master manipulators keeping them on the back burner. What you can do is don\u2019t show your weakness to her, get the f\u2019ing gym and use the time to heal to transform to be the best version of yourself. Need someone to talk to shoot me a message. Don\u2019t ever let her see you sweat and don\u2019t take her back. Otherwise, every time she wants to fuck another guy should just break up with you for a while and if that doesn\u2019t work out, come running back to you. Stay strong brother. \ud83d\udcaa",

Gender is irrelevant, age may make some difference, but ultimately it\u2019s how you smell. And I don\u2019t mean your shower habits. I mean, do you smell like a predator or prey. We all have it. Some are more attuned to it than others. It starts with a slight give/take imbalance, then it grows until one ends up always taking without ever giving back. It\u2019s a slow and methodical feast on anything the prey has to offer - emotions, resources, mental state, physical well-being. Breaking that cycle almost always involves breaking up. Then comes the hard part - moving on with the resolve to never fall prey again, yet managing not turning into a predator yourself. It\u2019s very tempting when you are fuelled by bitterness and you are battered and humiliated. But it always ends up being a lonely and sad road, as the little tater weasel will unquestionably discover for himself, once his money runs out. Take what you need from this to make yourself stronger. Learn your hawks from your snakes, they attack differently, some are more insidious than others. Be smart, be vigilant. Make them smell it on you, and you will never get walked on again. If your choices are between being a predator or prey - be a predator. But don\u2019t ever act like one. Because you are also good. And you want to be kind. A predator who never attacks because he is kind - that\u2019s virtue. A prey who never attacks because he\u2019s not powerful enough - that\u2019s pathetic and meek.",

If she\u2019s putting down to fuck on a dating app, she\u2019s going to get literally bombed with hundreds of responses in her inbox. Do you know what kind of past she had before she met you? I know I\u2019m gonna get killed by the women on here but it matters, despite what people say. I will also state that I\u2019n not hypocritical on this. I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s right for guys to go sleeping around because they can either. It\u2019s made for a real shitty dating world. My advice is if she can go to sleep in around right after she breaks up with you and I advertise it don\u2019t ever have contact with her in the future. Continue to improve yourself, and look for a girl with morals, and the ability to be loyal. Again, no Andrew T nonsense that she has to be a virgin. Otherwise she\u2019s no good, but I would just look for a woman who had limited sex to committed relationships.",

Because she would always tell me about her being a ho (as a joke) but did claim to be with a lot of men. We started out very sexually. She came onto me very hard. Never have I had a woman come at me the way she did. I'm not trying to shit on her here with this comment or anything, or disrespect her. But if that answers anything for you lol \n\nI made a post about our relationship if you're interested and have time \n\nThanks for the advice",

Personally I was fine with it because there was a reason why we split, but I didn\u2019t date again for three years. In case it\u2019s not clear, he is a man and I am a woman. In fact, when I think of my friends (male and female) whose marriages/relationships have ended (I\u2019m 50, so I have some life experience here), the vast majority had the men dating first. You keep drinking that Tater-Aid, though.",

I got offered a chance to tutor kids taking first level accounting, because I nailed that class too!!

Some people here use the word gaslighting to explain more overt behaviour within agreement reality.\n\nAgreement reality is both a good thing and a bad thing. You and I agree these words mean something but when you systematically deny someone their reality, that does bad things to their brain. The bad side of agreement reality is considered psychological abuse. Why people do it is because of self esteem issues. They have self esteem issues because they relate to their thoughts and feelings as real, a reflection of them, defining them. They are partially correct but they are incorrect that their thoughts are them. I won\u2019t continue because this is an evolving theory I\u2019ve been working on for several years.

At least in the case of my mathematics degree, they deliberately put in very hard questions so that from a cohort of 100+ students, only a small handful would score above a 90 in any particular test. For example, in an exam of 100 marks, 15 of those might be assigned to very hard questions made to distinguish the top 10 students from the top 5, i.e. it's expected that the vast majority of the cohort won't be able to answer them. \n\nIf the cohort average was too high at the end of the semester, often the final exam would be made much harder to bring the average down, or sometimes the final weighted average mark for that unit would be retroactively scaled to fit the desired bellcurve (usually ~65 average with a standard deviation ~15).\n\nIn my particular uni, the bar for HD (high distinction i.e. 4) was 80% and up, and D (distinction) 70-80%. The 50-70% score-band generally contained over half the cohort. The idea being that as far as academic achievement goes, It's much more important to be able to clearly differentiate those who are extremely good and 'just' very good, than it is to differentiate those who are good enough and just 'good'",

The difficulty of the exams made it so the average grade was around D or C, meaning there were very few people who got A's (maybe around 10% for the easiest courses, and around 30% failed the exam). \n\nThe grading was done using points and varied from course to course and not percentages but for an average class if you got above 75% you got an A.\n\nIf someone got all A's or B's they would be seen as very very good, that's always been confusing for me because if you got around 80-90% on an exam in my university you would have to be extremely good at the subject.

No matter which university you attend, a 4.0 GPA in accounting is an excellent achievement. \n\nI am from the UK and read people trying to make comparisons above. It is very difficult to do so. A 1st is the highest score you can receive for a British degree, but can amount to as low as a B when comparing percentages. Comparisons are often not suitable.",

I promised I wouldn't let kids accomplishments in my life go unnoticed. So I always celebrate when they excel. Everytime.\n\nSeeing this post makes me sad for you but also makes me want to tell you that I'm proud of you. I don't know you but this is amazing and I understand the hard work that goes into making yourself stand out among your peers. Keep going because you deserve the best life.

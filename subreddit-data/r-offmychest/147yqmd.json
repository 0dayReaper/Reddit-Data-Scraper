I am a bit disappointed since they seemed interested in me first a couple months back. But honestly, whatever, we're fairly different people. And I think I we wouldn't have been happy together. Sure I thought about it, but they seemed more the social butterfly type. I am everything but, more fringe if anything. So I'm happy I did it, and am sort of glad nothing came out of it.",

My mom sent me to an expensive ass school for me to do nothing with it. There was so much at my fingertips and I wasted it.\n\nLike, I\u2019ll never get that shit back and that\u2019s weighing on me. I got college but that\u2019s different.",

Go live it up in college, don't waste time looking back. Use it as a learning experience on what not to do in the future. Trust me when I say college will DWARF high-school. Hope that helped",

But I went to school somewhere that\u2019s literally a national historic site with tuition that\u2019s more expensive than most colleges. People automatically look at me different when I tell them where I went to school. And I just feel like I didn\u2019t live up to that.\n\nOf course you forgot because there was nothing memorable, but for me, you don\u2019t forget where I went to school.",

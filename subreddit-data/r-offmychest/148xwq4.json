A obscure twitter handle had to grab my attention with a video. \n\nAGAIN, ON TWITTER. \n\nIt looked like any video you can just take with your phone. Not a \u201cdark web\u201d feel to it at all\u2026\n\nThe poor fucking child. I hope wherever she is she\u2019ll be found safe and away from the abuser. I submitted a online tip as well as a phone call with a fbi department specializing in child exploitation. \n\nI think I\u2019m going to delete twitter and not look back. I\u2019ll be done with most of social media for a good while.",

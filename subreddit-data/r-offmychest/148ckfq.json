    "postText": "I feel like I'm losing myself\n\nI made a throwaway account for this, but I just needed to get it off my chest. \n\nI feel so unbelievably alone. I've just turned 18, and everyone around me is telling me that these are the best years of my life, but if they are then fuck that because I can't imagine how life could possibly get more painful. \n\nI'm struggling with some quite severe mental illness issues (PTSD, Anxiety and Anorexia) which has meant a lot of friends have either abandoned me, or I've cut them off because I just don't have the energy to interact anymore, but now I just feel lonely. \n\nI want friends, or just someone to talk to and let everything out to but I don't have anyone in my life like that at the moment. \n\nI just don't really know what to do. I'm so lost. I'm so empty and I feel so helpless. I wish I could feel like myself again.",

There does not exist a reward large enough to make me want to relive my late teens and early twenties. \n\n\n\nShittiest time of my life.\n\n\n\nYou have to just kinda hang in there. The older you get, the more you understand and the better you get at dealing with your conditions.\n\n\nPeople like us don't really have a \"peak\" it's more \"ebb and flow\". Things are harder for us, but   we also tend to find people who have similar struggles as we go through life. You will meet people and experience things that make you understand that fighting to live as the best version of yourself is worth it. \n\n\nIt gets better, it gets worse, it's gets crazy, it gets different...life is a lot of things. You just hang in there and keep going until you get to a life that's worth every single hard time. \n\n\nYou'll get there.",

    "postText": "Kids got abused more back then, but that didn\u2019t change their behavior overall, they were obedient until they got balls to rebel. Kids will be kids, no matter the generation. \n\nI feel like people just use that line, when they don\u2019t like it when a parent uses gentle parenting. Well getting hit and screamed at didn\u2019t work, my 70 year old grandma tells me all the stories of back then when she\u2019d be rude to her parents. \n\nThe point is, the older folks weren\u2019t any better as kids/teenagers as kids \u201cnow a days\u201d. Also, I was informed by someone, that it\u2019s a tradition for the older generation to say that shit to the younger. I\u2019ve even seen my generation (Gen Z) make jokes about how they will say the same stuff to our kids. I won\u2019t participate in that though.",

            "comment": "Another thing older generations don\u2019t understand is that our world has dramatically, DRAMATICALLY changed. Back in \u201ctheir day\u201d, mental health led to ostracizing people from society, lobotomies or institutionalizing them. But now all of a sudden people are \u201csoft\u201d for hearing their children out and not viewing them as property? Wow, what a concept. They\u2019re the same types of people that complain their children don\u2019t call them and refuse to understand why. \nIf I\u2019d intended to go to graduate school, I\u2019d actually had a plan outlined to do my dissertation on the prevalence of narcissism in elder generations, because it\u2019s really quite alarming. Anything that deviates from their projected ideas of a perfect world is evil and deserves to be banned? Fuck that. The kids are gonna be fine, if you let them be fine. They\u2019re refusing to lay down and take shit just because someone else says so. Gentle parenting is not coddling. Hitting your kids serves no purpose other than inciting fear. I remain baffled how this just fails to click in their minds. It\u2019s really not that radical.",

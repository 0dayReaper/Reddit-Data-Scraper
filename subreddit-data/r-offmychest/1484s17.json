    "postText": "i logged into a very old alternate instagram account so i could just look at my exes instagram account because she blocked me on my main, we\u2019ve been over for like 3 months now it\u2019s actually stupid. I\u2019m still not over her and i find myself obsessing over her from time to time. anyways i viewed her story with that account and a friend of hers (who also has me blocked on my main) viewed my main instagram story and then immediately blocked me after but it still showed that she viewed it. anyways i log back onto my old account to find out that her friend blocked that one too, but my ex didn\u2019t? I made the account look like a completely different person, it\u2019s actually very weird now that i think about it. anyways i set that account for deletion because i\u2019m embarrassed. should i still delete it or will that make\nit more obvious or weird??",

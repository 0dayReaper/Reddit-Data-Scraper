    "postText": "I just want to stop existing. Not die, I just wish I was never born to begin with. I wake up every morning wishing I just passed in my sleep. I feel like I\u2019m stuck in one of those games you can\u2019t pause and you have to see it through. I have too much to leave behind. A loving partner, a son, a good job, a nice family, everything. I\u2019m not Rich by any means, I struggle financially but still make enough to pay the bills and keep my baby fed. I feel like my existence is a burden to everyone around me. I just feel like I\u2019ve gotten myself in too deep and can\u2019t bring myself to end it because I don\u2019t want to leave my baby behind, I love him but I feel like he\u2019d be better off without me, with someone else much better equipped mentally to be a parent. I can\u2019t do it\u2026 I just can\u2019t\u2026",

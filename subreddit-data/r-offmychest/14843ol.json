    "postText": "Sent out invites to a pretty big birthday about 4 weeks ago, and have only gotten 3 replies so far. 2 yes, 1 no. Some people left my texts on delivered. Feeling like crap to be honest and I know people have stuff going on since it\u2019s summer but I only invited \u201cclose\u201d friends. These same friends have been able to go to every single other party except for mine and it\u2019s never been an issue. As far as I know there\u2019s been no bad blood at all. To be honest I might just cancel the party and hang out with the people who said yeah instead. I hope I don\u2019t sound like I\u2019m overreacting but I\u2019d love some pick me ups right now or someone to just explain what I did wrong",

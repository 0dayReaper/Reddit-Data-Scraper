    "postText": "Boyfriend and I have been together 2 years and have a baby. We\u2019ve been talking about marriage and planning it out. We can even started a savings for it and decided we\u2019d be married in 2 years. Today, boyfriend to tell his mother about it and he came back saying he didn\u2019t want to get married for another 3 years instead and said it was bc we also needed to save for a house. But then he also brought up a 3 month break he had and his phone call with his mom as reasons as well. I feel really disappointed he changed his mind so quickly after talking with his mom. I understand and appreciate his thinking about a house and I cannot argue with him on that but I cannot help but you think it\u2019s not only the house. I think he\u2019s unsure about me, or his mother made him feel unsure. After 3 more years we\u2019d have been together for 5 years and that feels embarrassing. 5 years and a baby and I\u2019m just now getting a ring. I feel sooo hurt and stupid. I feel like after 5 years I won\u2019t even care to be married bc what\u2019s the point if we already went 5 whole years without being married. I was really excited about everything and have sacrificed to save a lot so we can be married in 2 years and I feel so disappointed in heart broken.  Boyfriend is mad I\u2019m even mad in the first place and we have fought all day and now I\u2019m sitting in bed crying lolll",

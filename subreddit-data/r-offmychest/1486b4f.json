    "postText": "I've been dating someone who we will call Ciri (I've been playing the witcher lately) and everything has been so amazing.\n\nCiri makes me feel loved and treats me far better then my last partner (it's also worth mentioning that then I meet Ciri I was suicidal and drowning in self hate). I call Ciri my night star and love them with every inch of my heart. But I have a inferiority complex so most of the time I think that they deserve someone better then me because I'm just some stupid oxygen stealing Aussie boy with autsim.",

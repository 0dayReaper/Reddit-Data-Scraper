    "postText": "\n\n\nSome background: I am 25 years old and have been dealing with my mom who is schizoaffective my whole life. I was basically raised by my dad who has his own issues with anger and anxiety, but was my main parent. I had a tough childhood where I had to take care and cover for my mom. I never understood what was wrong, I didn't know any different, but just knew that was how she was. I never wanted to be around my mom much and we never really connected or had a proper relationship. I just pushed her away. She was never properly functioning and I could never have a conversation with her. I dont even feel like she really even knows me and I don't really know her. I didn't know until my parents divorced in highschool about her being bipolar ( she was rediagnosed a few years ago as schizoaffective) because my Dad didn't see her that way and no one had that conversation with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPresent moment: My mom has been back in a hospital for a few months. Since my parents divorced 10 years ago she has been living with my grandma, but she can't take care of her anymore and I don't want her to. My mom is having psychosis of some kind and leaving strange voicemails that are scary and kinda traumatic for me to hear. She is calling a lot of people. I blocked the number,but she calls on \\*67 so now I am just stopping deleting messages and making my voicemail box go full. I believe they are looking for housing for her of some kind since my grandmother cant take care of her anymore. I am also living across the country. I feel so sad and depressed and ashamed and I just have been crying a lot. I don't know how to deal with all of this. I feel bad for my mom but I also never felt like she was a mom and I feel guilty feeling that. I also feel bad for my grandma. I just want to be happy and live my life but everything in my life is just declining and I don't want to get out of bed. I've always felt ashamed and embarrased and an outcast because of my moms issues. I feel like I will never have a relationship because my life is a burden. I just want a normal life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: my mom has been in a mental hospital for months and I am depressed",

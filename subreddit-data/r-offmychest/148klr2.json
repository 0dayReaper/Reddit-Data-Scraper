    "postText": "I (m20) live in Australia. I am currently studying at Tafe. I\u2019m living comfortably with my stepdad. I have a casual job at target. My life isn\u2019t that bad, I think I\u2019m well educated and living well off, but yet I cry myself to sleep most nights because I\u2019m longing to have someone in my life. Someone to tell me they love me, someone to tell me they appreciate me. I have never been in a relationship, I\u2019m a virgin, I\u2019ve never kissed a girl, never even held a girls hand. I\u2019ve been close to having a relationship once. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong. Am I an idiot for wanting to be loved by someone so badly? I hate feeling lonely and sad, yet I feel like that everyday. Sometimes I feel maybe I\u2019m not good enough. People say I\u2019m young, I still have time, but I\u2019m fearful of never finding someone. I just want to know if I\u2019m worth it to someone for once in my life. It gets so hard waking up in the mornings and going to sleep at night. Idk what to do with these feelings. They never leave.",

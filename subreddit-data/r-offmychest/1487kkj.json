    "postText": "I\u2019ve always believed that everything happens for a reason. No matter how good or bad things are. But sometimes I just can\u2019t help but to think, why is this happening to me? \n\nI just signed a lease for an apartment and the move in date is July 1st. I have to drop off my deposit on the 24th, which means Ive had to be in a tight budget to save $2350 in one month. \n\nBUT I caught strep on June 1st. I was out for two days so my paycheck was little. I had to take 10 days of antibiotics to make it go away. Nope, after 10 days, I am positive again with strep and this time it\u2019s also with Covid. I HAVE STREP AND COVID right now. I have to be out until Saturday for Day 5, which means I\u2019m not working until Monday the 19th. I have to use this week\u2019s paycheck to also pay for next week\u2019s expenses/bills. I\u2019m stressing out but it worked out well. I will just be super broke until end of this month. \n\nMy dad is helping me with some more money if I need it by the 24th and I\u2019ll just pay him back the week after. I am so stressed, but what could be the reason of all this? I\u2019ve been stressed lately for all other things so maybe the universe is telling me to calm down and just start packing and relax while at it? Does anyone else believe in this?",

    "postText": "Long-time lurker, first time poster. Throwaway account.\n\n\rI implore you read this with as much an open mind as possible. My mind is still reeling from everything that has happened. I truly am lost. Your compassion, empathy, and understanding will be very much appreciated.\n\n\rContext:\n\n\rMy husband (34M) and I (34F) were high-school sweethearts. He was the typical computer whiz - you know the type; and I, a wallflower. We connected through theatre in 2006 when we were seventeen. He was into the technical aspects, and I, costumes, props, and sets. I feel we balanced each other perfectly. \n\n\rThink High School Musical.\n\n\rThere was one issue: my husband's baseball-playing older brother, twenty-one at the time, seemed to have a thing for me and, admittedly, it felt nice to be wanted by someone who was revered by most, if not all women. It made me feel special.\n\n\rHe was 6'6\", had green eyes, and a beautiful smile. I'd like to give myself the benefit of the doubt and stress that I was seventeen; young and stupid.\n\n\rWe'd basically play-fight and tease each other all the time. I thought it was harmless, and for the most part it was. Around Christmas (in which he was spending at his parents, where my then-boyfriend and I at the time were), we both got a little drunk. One thing led to another. We ended up having sex. It was something we both immediately regretted, and something we both swore to never let my now-deceased husband know. \n\n\rI suppose the silver lining is, now he never will. It would have killed him. He loved his brother, but there was always an undercurrent of resentment there.\n\n\rSkip to say, just under two months ago. 2023. The wounds are still very fresh. I won't delve into how my husband died. It's too traumatic. All that matters is, he did. I was a mess in the midst of it all, and a night or two after the wake I began drinking. My husband's brother came to check on me. \n\n\rI simply wanted to feel something. I was - still am - so disconnected, numb, and I wanted a sense of familiarity. Point blank - we slept togethere. Again. Neither of us said anything afterwards, and since we've not even exchanged a single message.\n\n\rNow, after taking several tests following a missed period, a positive result has been confirmed by my GP. This would be fairly straightforward, except I slept with my now-dead husband the day he died. And so, whether I'm pregnant or not isn't the issue. \n\n\rI simply don't know who the father is, and I don't know how to proceed. I don't want to pursue a termination and there's a 40/60 chance it's my husband's. That in itself gives me hope. \n\n\rHowever, I'm feeling tremendous guilt. This was so out of character for me. Really. I was feeling so much grief, and so I'm trying to be understanding and compassionate to myself. But I'm so incredibly conflicted.\n\nI'm not sure what to do, and needed to get this off of my chest.",

Although it would be very difficult being a single mother.  (Depending on the brothers decisions regarding that) It\u2019s a bad situation, I\u2019m sorry.",

            "comment": "Okay, something that seems to be getting missed here are two facts.  This guy frankly sounds  like a predator.  You had sex with him twice, under situations where the consent was dubious at best.\n\n1) you were 17 and he was 21.  What the actual fuck?  In many places that's statutory rape.  That's really, really creepy on his part.  He was a whole ass adult having sex with a minor.  A minor who looked up to him.  NOPE!\n\n2) The second time you were grieving and drinking.  If you are drinking and consent wasn't given before you got drunk, that's not consent.  And that's when he just happens to \"drop by\".  You were exceedingly vulnerable and \"Whoopsy!  I just happened to fall into my grieving, drunk, sister in laws vag! Her bad though! Damn, I didn't even think to use a condom hey?\" \n\nOn top of that, you say his relationship status is complicated?!   What....The......Actual......Fuck.\n\nI highly suggest some counselling here to help manage your grief, as well as what you truly wish to do about your pregnancy.   Your guilt frankly doesn't seem warranted to me.  Stay well away from this sorry excuse for a man.  Do not be alone with him, don't drink around him.   You should be able to get a scan done to see how far along you are.  It sounds like the dates are far enough apart for it to be definitive.",

    "postText": "25m. Just moved to Denver officially. Been here for about 2 months now. I've tried volunteering with 4 separate volunteer organizations, some multiple times, no luck. I've tried going to several meetups, no luck. I've gotten the contact information of and reached out to about 4 different people and then tried asking them to hang out, each multiple times. I've tried going to a couple of shows. I've tried talking to people on hikes. I work remotely. I spend literally all of my time alone when I'm not volunteering, hiking, going to the gym, or going to a show of some kind. I have no close friends in this city. **Why is so insanely difficult to make friends?**\n\nEveryone seems so busy with their own friends and personal lives that it's hard for me to break into that bubble. When people go to events, they go for a purpose and with other people, not to meet new people. Going to these social places alone is really hard for me. When I'm there, what do I do, just go into their personal space and say hello? That's weird, right? What, am I supposed to sit around them and listen until I can forcefully and awkwardly butt in?\n\nI'm happy to spend time alone, but without any close friends at all, life seems pointless. If I had just 2 or 3 good, close friends that I see regularly then I would be happy. I can't even find 1. I know I'll find friends eventually, but I cannot seem to figure out how. I've tried all of the things I'm supposed to try. All I need is one person to invite me somewhere, and I don't even to be friends with them - I just need them to invite me to a social event so I can meet other people through them, right? But I can't even find one. It's really exhausting to keep trying so hard to experience failure and rejection constantly. I've always had problems making friends, but this time it just feels debilitating.",

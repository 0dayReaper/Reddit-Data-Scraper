Wanna go out with me?\u201c\n\nOf course I said yes. \n\nHis sweet face just *lit up*. Like, he smiled the same goofy smile he gave me when I said yes the first time, 8 years ago. \n\nAnd I know it\u2019s cheesy and it\u2019s silly and it\u2019s kinda corny, but it made my day.\n\nWe got home and talked about it, and I mentioned hearing the *shoot your shot* comment. He said he told the guy next to him he was about to ask out the hottie at the fountain. \n\nAnd the guy next to him knows I\u2019m his wife. \n\nAnd he still cheered him on.\n\nAnd it just made it that much cuter.",

We have the most amazing soon-to-be 7 year old daughter. \n\nOur relationship didn\u2019t start out in the traditional way (it\u2019s in my posts if you\u2019re curious), and I got pregnant really early in our dating relationship. We have been through quite a bit in the last 8 years. \n\nI love him more now than I did when I first realized I loved him. He loves me more now too. \n\nI was in an abusive and loveless marriage before this, I never knew love could be like this. It\u2019s amazing. \n\n10/10 would do again. Maybe not the abusive and loveless relationship - but then I wouldn\u2019t have my two big kids\u2026.",

The husband would flip her off (while winking at me), also through me, when she turned her back.  It seemed kinda hostile, but on the other hand either of them could have easily requested a different office at any time so I think they liked it that way.  That was a pretty weird summer.",

We occasionally cross paths \"professionally\" but typically we don't interact on a day to day basis.  One time we were walking towards the cafeteria to get lunch.  One guy we both know caught up to us and we had a quick chat.  At some point I turn to my wife and say something like \"hey I have nothing going on this evening, wanna grab a drink after work?\"  The guy walking with us seemed slightly uncomfortable, but we kept going.  As we arrived at the cafeteria he finally seems to bubble over with discomfort and says \"hey aren't you both married?\"  We give him a seriously confused look as my wife says \"yes\".  He looks at her uncomfortably, then to me, and I realize he must be one of the few people around that doesn't know we are married to EACH OTHER.  And he thought he was just witnessing me asking \"another married woman\" out on a date.  It took me a minute to clarify that I wasn't \"asking her out\" in that way.  We had a good laugh about that for years afterward",

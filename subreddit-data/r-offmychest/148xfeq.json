I was out of it for two weeks. \n\nThese people only called me when they needed something and when I couldn't help them because I couldn't even wipe my ass correctly, the just stopped answering. \n\nI get the world doesn't revolve around me, and that people have lives to live. \n\nThe most I got was \"Fine, text me when you can work again\" \n\nA little compassion would've been nice, and I'm thinking sad thoughts RN. Maybe I'm the problem, maybe I'm not as good a friend as a thought.",

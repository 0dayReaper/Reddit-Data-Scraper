    "postText": "This is one of my first times in this thread so I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m expecting by just dumping all these thoughts and fears here. Support? Advice? Just to get it out? Regardless, whatever you do, please be kind\u2026\n\nI am going to preface this by saying there is NOTHING wrong with getting help or taking meds - I just have never wanted medicine for myself. I wanted to be independent of medications and support my mental health by myself\u2026 Over the past few years though, a mix of PTSD and anxiety caused by other traumatic events have me constantly on edge to the point I think it\u2019s currently hindering my ability to conceive a child. \n\nTonight, I am up well past 1 am fearing the potential of people outside. There\u2019s nobody there - I check my cameras every time I think I hear a voice or a noise and it\u2019s normal outside. My fear is amplified because my mother is visiting and fell asleep to watching true crime documentaries and the voices are faintly reaching my room causing my brain to say \u201cpeople are outside the house.\u201d (This is where the voices and noises are coming from.) I could go downstairs and shut it off but leaving my bed sounds terrifying too. I am about to start PMSing and my anxiety spikes during that time so this anxiety could be hormones but I am afraid I\u2019m getting to my breaking point with dealing with this. \n\nI can\u2019t tell my husband since I already haven\u2019t had the courage to go back to therapy yet despite assuring him I\u2019ll go. He is so supportive, he is my rock, but I have no strength to advocate for myself if I get yet another bad doctor. (For reference: I once had a therapist get mad when I finally did advocate for myself and told her she wasn\u2019t working out and tried to diagnose me with schizophrenia - a second doctor confirmed I am not schizophrenic shortly after that incident. During the second opinion, the doctor was actually baffled at the suggestion since I have zero indications.) I know he wouldn\u2019t talk or even think negatively of me if I decided that medicine is the proper path but I can\u2019t just keep expressing that I need to go get help followed by not doing it. I\u2019m embarrassed even if he thinks nothing of it - to him, talking about it is a big step but, for me, it just feels like I\u2019m not doing anything but complaining about it.\n\nI also used to take Zoloft back in 2013 but it gave me brain zaps and super-short white outs every time my blood pressure quickly spiked, whether in fear or anger. I wouldn\u2019t want medicine to be permanent but I\u2019ve heard of so many people getting worse after stopping their medicine and, I\u2019ll be honest, I can\u2019t even remember to take my prenatals while trying for a baby (side note: if you\u2019re planning on starting trying, take prenatals before you\u2019re pregnant if you can.) so what\u2019s to tell me I\u2019ll remember anxiety medicine? \n\nEither way, thank you for letting me put this here. I at least feel a little better having been able to write it out. \n\nTl;dr: I\u2019m very anxious all the time. I might need meds but there\u2019s a lot of factors that make me question whether or not it\u2019s right for me. All I know is I really don\u2019t want it to come to that for me.",

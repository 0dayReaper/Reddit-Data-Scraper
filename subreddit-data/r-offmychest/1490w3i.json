    "postText": "Me (28F), have been avoiding my (30M) boyfriend of 5 years, approaching 6.\n\nLately, I\u2019ve been ignoring my boyfriend. It\u2019s been 3 days now. He and I are busy people, we have a mutual respect for each other and our work, but we\u2019re happy with our situation. We don\u2019t live together because of the distance of our jobs, it just wouldn\u2019t be convenient. So half the time we\u2019re long distance. Because of this he didn\u2019t grow suspicious until I began denying his FaceTimes, turning off my location. This is all because I got into a car crash, becoming injured in many parts, but most of it wasn\u2019t anything that couldn\u2019t be treated or healed, except for my kidney. I had been hit in my abdomen, sliced, damaging it to the point of failure, losing my only kidney. Before I continue, I\u2019ll give some backstory to why I only have one: My blood type is type O. When I was 18, my little brother (16) was in dire need of a kidney, so I became a donor for him. I was going through a huge depressive stage, so I figured \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen, death?\u201d, at the time I wouldn\u2019t have minded it, but now I don\u2019t want to die. I still love my little brother, I would do it again, but I need one. Yes, I\u2019m aware dialysis is an option, I refuse to live my short remaining time on it. I\u2019ve been told I have an estimate of 4 more days to live. I love my boyfriend with all my heart, god I\u2019d give him my 2nd kidney if I had one, I could never accept his. If I were to see him, or even let him know what\u2019s happening to me, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to become my donor (he has type O as well). This is only since he doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done, the guilt I carry. Something I\u2019ve done wrong, I don\u2019t deserve his kidney or him any longer. Having to risk his life and go through such pain for someone so horrifically unloyal unknowingly, is wrong. If I haven\u2019t given enough hints, I cheated on my boyfriend. Spring 2019, me and him were going through a rough patch. My coworker (22M) at the time was comforting me. Drinks, one after the other, then suddenly I was in another man\u2019s bed. I live with this shame and as far as I\u2019m aware, he doesn\u2019t know. What should I do? Do I tell him?",

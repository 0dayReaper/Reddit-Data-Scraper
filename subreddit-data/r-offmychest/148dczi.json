    "postText": "I was in a car accident last year. I had to move back in to my parents to recover. I'm in a lot of pain since then. Sometimes I can only focus on the pain and not think about anything else.\n\nI'm also trying to finish my master degree. I have an appointment with my study advisor every few weeks.\n\nNow i called with my boyfriend last Friday, I was very happy. Because I had 4-5 days were the pain was around 2-3 (scale 1-10). I finally started to feel like myself again, I was so happy. It was a really hard year for me emotionally and physical.\n\nHe did not really respond, he was not happy. He was focusing on my study and that I have a delay. That I needed him to send my thesis, so he can see how much progress i made. I said I did not want to and that I talk with my study advisor and she helps me He kept pursueing.\n\nI said to him: The last few months I was focused on my health, I want to be able to cook dinner again and take care of myself. So I'm able live on my own again. He responded with that I exaggerate the pain and that I make it worse then it is.\n\nWe are together for 8 years, we lived together. After the car accident I need to move back to my parents. He was not even with me in this journey. I saw him maybe 6 times.\n\nAfter the call we had, I felt upset and I still am. I feel kind of angry at him. For me it feels like he stole my happiness. Imaging not being able to have a pain free day in 11 months. And finally beign able to move without extreme pain and the first reaction is my study delay and making me feel small. He kept talking about it for 15minutes.\n\nBesides that he does not want me to cancel a concert we were going to. I'm not physical able to go, because I will be in a lot of pain. I talked about it already 2x, but he does not want me to cancle my ticket. He says: you will be fine. You can sit on the ground. But I'm not able to sit on the ground without back support, i tell him that and he will saw: If you are not going, I also do not want to go anymore, it is not fun without you. So he finds my study important, but still wants me to go to a concert I will have pain for 1-2 weeks after that and likely do less studying. If I tell him that he will say: it can not be that bad.",

Tell him you know your body best, and if he insists that you\u2019re playing it up, dump him. He can\u2019t read your mind, so he needs to do a better job of listening to you.",

Explain that you would like to do its just not possible at this point. If he tells you its not that bad I would suggest reminding him that he is not the one feeling the pain here and that for you this concert is not something you can go too. Hang in there friend.",

He said he does not know some else to ask.   \n\n\nThen a month latter he told me that his ex wanted to go, but that he said no to her. I said to him that I did not mind if she goes instead of me. (it is his high school relationship ex, so not a serieus relationship ex, but she know other people in the group as well).  \n\n\nI will talk with him again, if he maybe now knows someone or the ex",

I hope you keep feeling better and better.As for your bf that\u2019s not a good partner.It is supposed to be in sickness and in health.You deserve so much better and he needs to be understanding what you\u2019re going through. You were in a car accident you\u2019re not just going through something small like the cold. You need time to heal and he needs to understand that not force you to go somewhere that might cause more pain. I just want you to know they\u2019re people out there who will care for you in this situation and show endless love and support.Imagine in a few years from now you guys have a kid and you\u2019re still recovering from your pregnancy would he still treat you like this? That\u2019s not an ideal partner.",

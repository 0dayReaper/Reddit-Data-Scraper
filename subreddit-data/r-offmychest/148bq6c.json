    "postText": "Hi everyone, I just need somebody who can help me to support this.\n\nI got a lot, A LOT in my head, can't stop thinking about the future, how to support my family, and how not to let them down.\n\n(Sorry if my English reads broken, it's not my first language)\n\nOk, let's start.\n\nI am guy who came to Australia and in the first week, I saw the opportunities this country has.\n\nI decided to stay here, doing all the processes to get the PR. I met my wife here ( Japanese \\[don't ask me how but she married me hehe\\]) we have two beautiful babies (two years and seven months respectively).\n\nSometimes I really just want to run away, but that would not solve all the problems, I know that I just need to keep pushing. Seeing my babies growing makes me think that I need to be a great father, but sometimes I feel so tired that I can't do anymore, but I remembered that's not the duty of a man, I need to hold, keep holding the pressure and keep going.\n\nI have been employed four times here in this country, but nothing looks great, In all of those jobs I have been fired (I did my best trust me), but looks like I am not good enough.\n\nWatching my wife's face and seeing in her eyes all the trust she has in me, put a huge guilt on my back that makes me think that I have ruined her life, bringing her to my world of chaos.\n\nHow can I teach my babies to be successful men in life when I see myself and have not achieved great?\n\nHow can I watch my wife's face and don't feel guilty?\n\nWhat else can I do? I am allowed to feel tired? Could I have a break?\n\nSometimes I want to cry but crying will not solve anything.\n\nAbout the process of the PR, I have taken three times the PTE exam, the first time was to get my current Visa (the requirements were very low so I got more than enough). The second and third time was the worse. I have been studying for that exam since 2020, I got all the tricks, I know the structure and I know everything that I need to do, and still getting low scores (R:64, W:62, S:60, L:64)If you watch some videos on YouTube about the exam you will have an idea. The last time when I saw my score I thought: \" I am being here for almost 5 years and my English has not gone more than intermedium, Am I wasting my time here?\"I have paid a lot of money for courses and materials, and seeing those results makes me think I've just wasted my time, the teacher's time, and the money.\n\nWithout that exam, my chances to get an invitation from the government are very low, I do not want to back to my country, I will feel like trash, let everybody down, including my wife and babies, feeling like a loser who could not achieve anything.\n\nBut again, I can't just stay in that position, crying will not solve anything, need to keep studying to get the score to get the invitation. At the same time, feeling like chains that are holding me and not letting me get exactly what I want.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nPlease somebody help me, I know God is with me, but sometimes I can't see him. I know I need help, to fix myself, to be a better husband, better father, and better man.\n\nI think that's it.",

            "comment": "Hey there,\n\nSo i understand that you are very upset and hurting but i would like to know a little more.\n\nWhy were you fired? \n\nYou want some real advice? You sound like you are getting hung up on the wrong things here. You say that crying wont help; but it actually does. It stops you from repressing feelings that keep you in a state of anxiety. Which brings me to my next point: you sound more concerned about crying than you do about having a stable job. \n\n\"Just couldnt be helped\" is the biggest excuse ever. Youre telling me that everyone else can get up, go to work for years and years, swallow the job and you couldnt stay in 4 of them? My guy, a couple awful jobs Id agree but 4-- at that point the problem seems to be you. Which brings me to my next point:\nIf you dont want to feel like a failure and need to be stable for your family, youre going to have to swallow the \"tough man\" mindset.\nFinding a stable job and making good money is a PRIVILAGE in this economy. There is simply no other way to do it than eat shit. Jobs are riddled with unpleasent people and you have to have a way to cope with them or youll never get anywhere. \n\nAs far as this test goes, you need to identify your weaknesses in the subject material and then put the work in to get better. But if your heart isnt in it or youre only worried about being perseved as a failure then youll never get better. Stop putting so much pressure on yourself that youre unable to retain any information.\n\nWhat does your wife think about any and all of this? I find that most men who are in these problems are married to intelligent women who have LOTS of ideas as to why and how to get out of their terrible situations. Your wife knows you better than all of us, what has she told you she wants?",

                    "comment": "Hey mate,   \n\n\nFirst, thanks so much for taking the time to give.  \nLet me explain in detail about those jobs  \n\n\n1) Pegasus: I was hired on a casual contract, to do a specific project, after I finished with all the requirements my manager call me and gave me the bad news that day was my last day with the company, she tried to keep me on the company but there was not another job for me (that was what she told me, I trust her world).  \n\n\n2) DataIQ: I was hired as Junior Web Developer (and I was the only one), the manager wanted me to build an entire software from scratch in less than 5 months. The requirements were not clear as he didn't even know what he wanted. Being in my probation period, after the third month they decide not to keep me in the role.  \n\n\n3) Nimbus Cloud: The team that was based in Sydney was made redundance, so, we were five that lost their jobs.  \n\n\n4) Solvar: The company was not doing well, my actual boss resign after my first month in the company. Also, the disorganization and the lack of documentation made it difficult, but I was doing my best to get over all those obstacles. In the end, they needed a person in New Zealand in the offices as my boss was leaving the company that was the person who could guide me. Again being my probation period they decided not to continue.  \n\n\nI do not want all of these to sound as excuses, but that's the truth\n\nAbout my wife, I'm trying to not let her know about all the things in my mind, I need to be stronger and protective, can't be weak in front of her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout the test, mate I have done it, I know what is my weakness, but as I said feeling like having some chains that hold me to make any progress.",

                            "comment": "Hey there,\n\nSo those are completely valid reasons to not have a job and my heart goes out to you. All i can say is that you have to keep looking, for as long as it takes, to get something steady that works for you. The job market is absolutely horrid-- but if you need something now to support yourself dont be too proud to job hop and do something that can pay the bills today. Taking care of you and your family should be no. 1 and it doesnt matter how or what job you take to do it as long as it gets done.\n\nIm pretty sad to hear that you dont trust your wife to let her know whats going on with you. Ive been married long enough to have this senerio happen to me and it feels like lying by omission when the truth comes out.  Youre not protecting anyone by not letting your wife be a partner to you and its an oppertunity to share these burdens and make you a stronger couple. Chances are, if this is going on shes worried anyway and picks up on how badly things are going.\n Im American, so culturally women do not accept mens promises of protection or look to them to be saviors (we have our own properties, careers, and money) but it sounds like thats not your culture and my opinion has to respect that. I will say that its far better to have another intelligent person that you love fighting in your corner than to go through things alone. This whole idea of appearing \"strong\" sounds exhasting and im not sure who you are trying to impress with all that suffering. \n\nAs for your test, you might need to learn in a completely different way. My grades in school always depended on the quality of the teacher. I am terrible at memorization but can remember if i take concepts and words and write a story with them. Try to engage yourself in an unconventional way that interests you. For example,  if you have to know that george washington wore wooden teeth make up a story in your head that he carved flowers into them first. If you have to know how to spell 'conscience' remember that its spelled by mad felons 'cons' doing 'science'. Find something in the subject matter that jumps out at you and associate an idea with it to remember the answers. This is what literally turned me into a good student when i knew that memorizing cold facts would never work for me. But that is me, and there are a lot of resources out there that teaches you how to study.\n\nHow to study is an actual skill that not everyone knows. I would most definitely look up ways to learn. The hardest thing to do is to keep yourself motivated, and it sounds like youre really upset. Its so easy to give up when you see yourself fail something over and over. But that doesnt mean you cant keep trying. It can be 10 or 100 times you fail, but it only takes 1 time to succeed. I really hope you think about these things and that you can make the choices nessisary to make your situation better. Best of luck to you",

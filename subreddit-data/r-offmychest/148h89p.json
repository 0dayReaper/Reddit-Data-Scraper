    "postText": "Just wanted to say this to someone. Anyone. Explain it a bit.\n\n\nI\u2019ve been in several relationships, and married for a few years as background. Im in my early 30s.\n\nI went through this bad relationship with some girl i met on bumble, she was dating me and someone else at the time. It hurt so I broke it off and decided not to date for awhile.\n\n3 months later I\u2019m playing video games and meet this girl on discord. We hit it off right away and soon we are watching tv shows together on the phone, and sleeping every night \u201ctogether\u201d on the phone. I fell in love with this girl, sharing my stories throughout the day, and she was sharing hers. I felt so relaxed and happy. She respected me a lot and shared my views and humor. \n\nThe problem is that she lived in the Middle East. In a very difficult part. Sometimes the internet was so bad we would cut off and have to reconnect. I didn\u2019t care. There was no sex obviously. I didn\u2019t care she made me happy.\n\nWe had plans to meet. She was supposed to get some money from a settlement and use that to requirements to move to the U.S and live here (which by itself is very hard to get a visa from where she lives). I patiently waited and started to save up my money so when she comes she can live for a bit, get her footing, and relax. \n\nThe money never came. Lots of shady things with the government and the system to get the money. Idk. It was a lot of information. The trouble started about a year ago with her getting the money. From her story, the facility was against her getting the money and wanted to pocket it instead. So she got a lawyer to fight it. Still nothing.\n\n\nI helped her get a job where she lived. Her first job. At least she could work and save the money she needs. She didn\u2019t have to pay rent or anything. But the pay over there is atrocious. She was getting around $400 a month. So saving would still take time. I was willing to wait. I was happy. We spent literally every day together and sleep on the phone together, and we would wake up and tell each other our dreams type of thing.\n\nWith the job she got , and her being on such a different time zone, it was became very difficult to sync the time to talk on the phone. Whole day events became only 2 hours of convo. No more sleeping together because she would be at work during the time I slept. She was so happy to get the job I didn\u2019t want to sour the mood with how the times had changed. Some days we couldn\u2019t talk because I would come home and she would be sleeping, and not wake up until 1 am where I would be sleeping. \n\nThis went on for 8 months like this. At least we had our weekends together.  But as the months went on I felt myself losing feelings for some reason. We started to argue about the time I would spend with my friends. I would sometimes spend a night or two playing games with them because I had nothing else to do, since she was sleeping and I was home alone. It was very hard to time my schedule around the time she could potentially wake up, which was randomly from 10pm -2am, and often times I was tired and would sleep around 11 and she would still be sleeping.\n\nMost of our disagreements arose that I wasn\u2019t immediately available when she woke up like we used to be, but times had changed and I was feeling depressed being home by myself with nobody to talk to. I would feel guilty if I wasn\u2019t home when she woke up, because she would be sad, and it wore on me for awhile. \n\nThis went on for months and then as of 2 weeks ago something changed for me. I just suddenly resented staying home and just waiting around for someone. This wasn\u2019t a problem earlier in the relationship and suddenly it felt like an issue. I started to do more things outside like I used to before the whole relationship started approx 2 years prior. I told her in advance I wanted to start going out a bit more instead of staying home all the time. I started to go dancing and go to the gym and hang with my friends more often. Within those 2 weeks I still texted her but she was upset we didn\u2019t get to talk on the phone or upset I didn\u2019t text a lot, and she got very upset at me.\n\nThis culminated into a argument about how much time I have given her throughout the years and how 2 weeks of me don\u2019t something I love for once while she sleeps most of the day wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. It was. She felt unloved. And I realized the relationship couldn\u2019t continue like this, long distance with uncertainty when she would be able to move. No physical contract for a long time. I felt it was tough for me to handle by the end of the relationship but I really tried to make it work. Now that\u2019s it\u2019s over I feel I lost someone special and maybe I should have just gave her more attention. I should have made enough money to fly her over here. But i couldn\u2019t. And I hate myself for that. Now I lost someone special to me due to circumstances out of our control. I feel guilty for the false promises of us meeting one day. I should have been better but it\u2019s hard sometimes.\n\nThanks for reading.",

    "postText": "I (18F) am good friends with my (18M) friend. Do I like him? Absolutely. Does he know this? Totally, I told him prom night and here we are. Two friends who like each other because he\u2019s not ready to date and I\u2019m respecting it. What he didn\u2019t know is I spent months making him a scrap book from 9-12 grade. We\u2019ve been besties since 9 grade and I reached out to a lot of friends for pics to get this done. I gave him this last day of school and he was shocked. He said it was the best gift he\u2019s ever been given. Everything was fine until I finally get to the point of this post. One of our friends asked me out to ice cream and I didn\u2019t know if it was a date or not so I asked him what he thought our friend meant. Shawty goes \u201cI guess you\u2019ve been obsessing over the wrong guy this whole time!\u201d Call me overdramatic, I accept I sound silly when I say I was hurt from this. I told him that was uncalled for and he laughed it off. We talked more and it led to the college talk. He\u2019s leaving while I\u2019m staying in our area, I said I want to make sure we still see each other over the summer before august hits. He goes \u201c I hope you understand. I have other friends to see before I leave, not just you.\u201d I almost cried, but I kept it together and I told him that he isn\u2019t my whole world and I also have other friends. But we\u2019ve always been close so I want to keep in touch. He said he\u2019ll try, and the conversation ended. Part of me regrets making him the scrap book, it feels like he didn\u2019t appreciate it. I deserve someone who makes me stuff like that, not whatever that interaction was. I don\u2019t feel obsessed, I felt crazy having a bunch of pics of him in my room I was stoked to give those away. Never again man",

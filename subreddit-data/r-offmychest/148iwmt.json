A few decades of time and a lot of therapy later we discovered my agoraphobia partially was because of just how much I watched that show at a young age.\n\nThe show would play real 911 calls that sometimes included deaths or would soon to be deaths on them.\n\nI was very aware, way, way earlier than I should have been about my own mortality. I was unable to process it as an adult when most people come to face with their mortality just how mortal we are. I did not have the mental tools to properly process it as adults do.\n\nKnowing about death and how easy and quick it comes at 5 years old impacted me way more than we ever knew.\n\nThis also led to increased awareness of my own and others actions. lack of empathy in most people creating a hate for many people and thus further compounding my agoraphobia.\n\nYet here I sit in an office of 400 people wasting time on reddit.\n\nTherapy works yall. Just takes time and finding the right terapist.",

I don\u2019t have agoraphobia as far as I know, but my mom passed away very suddenly when I was four years old, and that was my first experience as a person realizing that we don\u2019t live forever and that we are, indeed, mortal. I think that somehow deep down affected me because now I\u2019m older and struggle a lot with health anxiety and the fact that I am going to die one day. I could die at any moment and any time, and via completely unexpected causes. Death can be so unpredictable and that\u2019s one of the scariest things about it; the unknown of it all. I also really relate to the lack of empathy for people thing\u2026 I\u2019m beginning to think I\u2019m just plain cold hearted and incapable of loving others.",

Be aware and act accordingly, it\u2019s as simple as it is difficult. Remember that the feeling associated with an event will never be the same as the event it self, the event is real and tangible and written in stone; our feelings about an event change with distance from an event as well as a bunch of other little factors. Cut the anxiety and bring in calmness one way or the other so you can understand and deal with the things in life that make you anxious",

To my moralistic little mind, this seemed extremely fucked up and cruel, and I legit wanted to stop reading for a while (although never actually did). But the real problem wasn't what I understood (very little) but that I'd stumbled onto the corner of a much bigger and more complex problem with human subjectivity that I wouldn't understand for a long time, but would continue to see looming, and it legit haunted me. The problem for me wasn't understanding things too young. It was not understanding them, but dimly perceiving their outlines.",

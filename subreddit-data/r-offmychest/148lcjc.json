I\u2019m on the 6th floor of a building and yesterday as I sat down in the office I was looking out of the window. Diagonally across the road from me is another tall building say 30 floors. A curtain opens and my eyes lock in- it\u2019s a women with a towel wrapped around her. She leaves and comes back within 30 seconds and takes it off revealing all, she ties it around her hair, turns around and picks something up and then walks off. I found this insanely hot and so today I looked again around the same time and the same sequence of events happened (minus the bending over). She sort of lingers in front of the window for a while and then gets changed. \n\nIs it wrong to look and pervy or is this fine because she\u2019s fully aware that her curtains are open?",

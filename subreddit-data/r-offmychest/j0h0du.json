    "postText": "My wife got the official results from her COVID-19 test today showing what we already knew: positive. My youngest son also has it based on deductive reasoning.\n\nWe\u2019ve spent the last 6-7 months being careful. Wearing our masks, maintains distance even from close family members. We only spent time with a select few people who we know were also being extremely careful.\n\nWe stopped volunteering for our church live-stream because they insisted on bringing people back for Sunday worship.\n\nWe only leave our house out of necessity (work, groceries, etc.).\n\nMy grandfather just got sent to the emergency room, just months after we lost my grandmother. So, we can\u2019t go see him even if he\u2019s able to go home.\n\nWe saw my mom and my MIL less than 10 days before my wife started showing symptoms, so now they have to quarantine.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that I won\u2019t have enough PTO at my job to keep it if/when I inevitably contract it from my wife.\n\nNot to mention the clients I have that are COVID deniers.\n\nI\u2019m so angry because we did everything right and we still ended up getting it.\n\nI\u2019m angry at the asshole deniers. I\u2019m angry at our dumbass politicians doing fucking nothing. I\u2019m angry at my church for being more worried about congregating than about safety. I\u2019m angry at the people who claimed that it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I\u2019m angry at those who refused to wear masks.\n\nAnd despite knowing that I did everything I was supposed to, I\u2019m angry at myself for not doing more.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the kind words, with the thread locked I can\u2019t reply to you. Please be overly safe because you\u2019re not just protecting yourself, you\u2019re protecting everyone else around you.",

If you have to quarantine because a coworker got it and you worked in close proximity to them for 15 minutes, you get two weeks, but the covid positive doesn't get paid. And I mean 15 minutes. I was was in the office with someone for 14 minutes who tested positive two days later and I wasn't quarantined.\n\n\nEdit in response to replies because the post is now locked. \n\nFrom what I was told, the company now considers covid to be the new normal and effectively blames the sick person for getting sick. Basically, if you test positive for covid 19 the company policy is that you are at fault, since they can't prove where you got it or whether you were taking precautions. They stopped paying the two weeks back in August, but until then I was the only person in the company who got it. I got it in April and got the two weeks pay, but according to WI that disqualified me from the pandemic unemployment assistance.",

It seriously feels like we\u2019re apart of a group project and everyone in the group left to go party while you\u2019re (I) the only one actually working on the damn thing. I want to scream at my family for being so cavalier about the whole thing especially when they know people who have had it/ died from it. I feel betrayed and left out and i would be even more pissed if my family caught it even after being so careful. I\u2019m so sorry. I really hope things get better sooner and the idiots who think they are invincible knock this shit off",

We had to sell our house and move into my wife's parents place temporarily. Been here 2 days. Went from isolation to a house with 10 people in it. Wife's sister brought random people over, grandma took the baby and shoved him in their faces without me knowing she even took him from the room. We told them please no random people, and if there are and they won't wear a mask tell us so we can go in our room until they're gone. Apparently too much to ask. Nobody will wear a mask. They won't even wash their hands or use hand sanitizer like what in the actual god damned fuck?!?! The baby is 26 days old FFS. I am so fucking stressed. Why the fuck does no one take this seriously? I will never forgive them if we get sick. I told them. They don't care about themselves, their own kid, or our newborn infant baby. We got tested before coming up here and were negative. Now I'm basically waiting to get sick, when is it going to happen? I have ptsd already, I have a hard time dealing with stress, and its taking everything within me to not freak the fuck out. Its like they live in a different reality where you apparently can't infect your family. Ffs half of people that get it don't know they have it. But if I get it, I have medical issues that pretty much guarantee I'm gonna get fucked up real good. Why risk everyone else's health and a future lifetime of medical problems and complications because you wanted your kids to have a play date? Why shove my infant baby in some random people's face? Is it so much to fucking ask? God damnit. OP, I'm so sorry for your situation. It's my worst nightmare and odds are with the way things are going here we are pretty much guaranteed to get it too. I don't know what to do. I have no control over the situation and I fucking hate everyone that refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation, and especially those who endangered my and my wife's and baby's life by being selfish fucking children who can't just take the most basic precautions to protect a newborn baby and their own family. Fuck people. We never should've done this but had no choice. We know 3 people that have died from covid, it's very real for us, I will never understand why our own family is pretending like nothing is going on. Please OP just know that its not your fault. The world is against people who care about others and their own well being. Your anger is completely justified. God damnit I am not religious but am \"praying\" you all have an easy time with it for whatever that's worth. I'm so sorry.",

The stress must be unimaginable and talking with a professional can help you learn to enforce your boundaries with these people and help relieve some of your anxiety and anger. \n\nI only suggest it because I got Covid at my place of work in a non-essential retail store from a guest not wearing a mask properly (which is like half of our customers). So my anger, frustration, anxiety, and ultimately depression from actually getting sick was almost too much for me to handle. But talking to my therapist via video on my phone really really helped me.  \n\nSending healing loving protective energy to you and your  little family!!\ud83d\udc95",

So with no other choice at a job and only being a couple that are both 22 years old, he went back. Only to get fucked out of close to 600 dollars, not to mention my boyfriend did a job in February that he hasn\u2019t gotten paid for yet. It was 900 for 3 days of work, no check (from a rather large well known company I might add). I might also add that 600 dollars is more than a week of work that he basically did for free, almost 65 hours (typically works 54 scheduled hours a week). I was okay, I just started a job at Walmart. Unlike me, my boyfriends place of work was a locally owned auto shop. \n\nAnyways, I only explained all of that because at the end of our quarantine, it was clear we may have never had it at all. I got tested about a week after he did, mine was negative. All the people we had been in contact with had also been negative. \n\nEdit: also fuck deniers, that\u2019s what my bf\u2019s boss was. After telling him he got tested positive, he said that it\u2019s a hoax and he\u2019s just trying to take off for my birthday (which was that following Monday). Bf just didn\u2019t want to get other people sick, especially since they don\u2019t wear masks due to the job being outside in the middle of summer. \n\nTLDR: fuck covid and fuck businesses that take advantage of young adults that have no other choice but to take their shit",

As I explained in another comment the number of people who had comorbidities is smaller than 94% because people with covid-related complications are included in the total.\n\n2. The risk factors for flu and covid aren\u2019t always the same. For instance, asthma is considered risky with flu, but has been shown to have little effect on hospitalization or death rates for covid. On the other hand, middle-aged adults dying of covid is much more common than with the flu, albeit still much rarer than for the elderly in both viruses.\n\n3. Most people don\u2019t get the flu every season, so even if they were to die of the flu anyway they might have had several more years to live before they caught it.\n\n4. The death toll in the US for flu seasons from 2010 to 2017, and flu seasons last about as long as covid has been spreading widely in the country, are 12,000- 51,000. The 2017-18 flu season was considered to be especially bad and is estimated to have killed 61,000, but the CDC labels that estimate as preliminary. Keep in mind that these are all post-season estimates that include many people who were never tested for flu unlike our covid numbers. So basically since the US\u2019 current death toll is unrivaled by past flu seasons it\u2019s hard to argue that all the people who died of covid would have died of flu anytime soon.",

I may have some verbiage wrong, but basically if you test positive or a Dr tells you to stay home because you are probably positive then you can get paid through the Family First - Employee Pay. It is 100% of wages up to 80 hrs and does not effect your PTO. If you are taking care of a family member or having to take care of a child because the child care provider is closed - its 2/3 pay up to 80 hrs under Family First Family Pay and does not effect PTO. If past 80 hrs are necessary, then you would claim the Family First Cares FMLA and that's 2/3 pay for up to 10 weeks (maybe 12,don't remember).\nPlease make sure you talk to HR about this.

It doesn\u2019t hurt to ask your doctor for a sedative if you need it because they will completely understand what you are going through.

I\u2019ve put so much effort into myself over the last few years and every time there\u2019s something wrong it\u2019s something I can\u2019t change. \n\nThe last few weeks have been amazing nice felt strong, confident, like I\u2019m still improving and with a little more work I can be where I want to. Then just a few minutes ago my best friend said something and she didn\u2019t even realize how much it hurt. All I heard was \u201chey, no matter what you do you\u2019ll never be good enough\u201d and it broke me. \n\nI\u2019m tired. I\u2019m angry. I just want to cry but the tears won\u2019t come. So I sweat it out at the gym, but I\u2019m still not in enough physical pain to outweigh the emotional.",

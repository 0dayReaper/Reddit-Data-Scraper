    "postText": "\nI feel absolutely in the right, and I don\u2019t care if it hurt her feelings to hear the truth. \n\nI (24F) called Jane (24F) over FaceTime two years ago to really give her my honest opinion, about how she hurt me, and how she would hurt countless others in her poorly imagined career as a social worker. \n\nThe three things integral to my fit or passionate attempt to decimate this girl\u2019s hopes and dreams were as follows:\n1. Jane was rejected from every MSW program she applied to except at the school where her mother was dean. She said it was because her autism made it too difficult to volunteer or intern at charitable organizations assisting the needy. She said she would still pursue social work\u2014 specifically CPS\u2014 because she grew up extremely rich and wanted to perform this job as charity. This was\u2026 extremely offensive as someone who grew up being involved with CPS. \n2. Jane being highly self-centered and oblivious to the comfort of others, being unable to tolerate loud noises\u2014 specifically crying, and being challenged and angered by anything that triggered her critical inner self that struggled to pick up on subtle nuances in speech and behavior, made this career choice almost palpably chosen to compensate for her weaknesses. \n3. The way she hurt me when I was in the worst period of my life. Her demonstrating \u201cempathy\u201d by monologuing about her single experience of loss or an abusive 2 month relationship with a college BF. Her joking about my abusers and failing to understand the gravity of me being houseless because a former roommate tried to traffic me. Her humble bragging about her parents buying her a fully furnished 2 br luxury condo while I was couch surfing. Her refusing to let me crash on her couch because it would be too \u201cdisruptive\u201d. \n\nI resent the idea that screaming at some dumb, haughty girl means I have anger issues!\n\nThe last straw wasn\u2019t even Jane refusing to let me crash in her 1 BR apartment when I was houseless. It wasn\u2019t even before that, when she talked over a everyone at my bday party for five hours about her dead dad THAT DIED WHEN SHE WAS 6, or when she constantly divulged how much money he left her and how it stings the insurance payout was the \u201conly reason\u201d she had an easy ride. Dudes, it wasn\u2019t even when I cried from joy because my older GF gave me a pair of designer leather shoes that weren\u2019t falling apart at the seams, the nicest things I had ever owned, and something I was afraid to price myself to be comfortable wearing them\u2026 and Jane immediately googled that they were $500 and called her mother to buy her the same pair\u2026\n\n Nope. It was actually when I started living with that girlfriend, whom I had just met, and Jane admonished me for dating a woman my \u201cmom\u2019s age\u201d, moving into this \u201cstranger\u2019s\u201d home, and letting her pay for all my shit\u2014 like my medical bills from malpractice done by poverty dentists. I ONLY HAD TO DO THAT BECAUSE JANE WOULDN\u2019T LET ME CRASH ON HER SOFA FOR A MONTH. A MONTH!!! No, maybe I wanted to do that, because watching this spoiled girl being served everything she had, clearly be ashamed that all she had to do was be born, and explode with jealousy that someone wanted me even in my shitty circumstances because of my cultivated wit and charm and despite my emotional baggage and in-spite of my NASTY ATTITUDE, honestly made me feel\u2026. Made me feel good?\n\nNo it made me fucking mad! Because I never judged Jane!!! I just shrugged her off. Judging me, me who comes from the population of people she wants to serve, because I really wanted to rise up instead of suffering indefinitely, will always make me seethe.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m sorry. Your story legit sounds like my coworker. She\u2019s going to become a counselor and am pretty sure she is a narcissist on top of being histrionic. So she has no empathy and does nothing but talk about herself and needs to be the center of attention. Clients have complained. Coworkers come complaining to me and I don\u2019t want to get involved because I worked with her at another agency and it was toxic as hell. They didn\u2019t want to hear my opinions about her and pretty sure she got fired or quit but she gets by kissing ass with the boss. \n\nMyself I am also an autistic person but grew up poor. The misfits were always my peeps so I wanted to work in mental health. I know how it is because I grew up with a mentally ill mother. Most of my coworkers are girls who look like models and grew up with money and know mental illness only clinically through books or TV. I know that shit is real and the people involved just want someone who understands. I worked as a social worker briefly and it was horrible. I found out first hand it is the agencies faults, they don\u2019t care if they are ripping apart families and I absolutely refused to be a part of it. \n\nShe sounds like a total see you next Tuesday though tbh.",

Like idk what was up with Jane besides being autistic and sheltered by her rich mom who never pushed her to overcome aspects of her disability. From the perspective of someone who just missed the autism diagnosis but got diagnosed late in life with ADHD, a lot of what secures that diagnosis for people seems to be lack of empathy that can be fully externalized. I think Jane was so bothered by second hand stress, she couldn\u2019t let me live with her, which is still shitty and mean. She made a big point that she had empathy but could never be friends with people like narcissists or histrionic people, just treat them at work. Which\u2026 was actually very alarming :/.",

Social work is all about the client/public. She literally cannot put herself in someone else\u2019s shoes and has issues with empathy. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with all that OP. You didn\u2019t deserve it.",

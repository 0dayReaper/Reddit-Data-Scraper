    "postText": "This is something I\u2019ve only recently come to terms with actually realizing everything that happened cause I kinda blocked it from my memory and I\u2019m really conflicted about not telling anyone \n\nMy cousins live out of country so we don\u2019t see them often. I\u2019m currently 18 I believe this happened when I was around 8-9, I\u2019m not completely sure as the memory is still a bit unclear. \n\nI have 4 cousins, 3 older and one younger, the cousin in question is 4 years older than me and is the second oldest. Because of the age ranges I would often end up hanging out with him and stay in his room whenever we visited (his room had two beds) as I was closest to him in age. \n\nThis was before I had a smartphone so the only real source of entertainment was his computer and his 3DS so I would frequently ask him to play them. \n\nHe began saying that I had to do favours in exchange for an hour of time to play the DS. This started with just \u201cclean my room\u201d which I did and then played the DS for and hour or so\n\nWhenever my time was up I was sitting on his bed/his side of the room and he said if I wanted another hour I had to do another favour, he told me to grab his crouch and move my hand up and down, I refused to which he grabbed my hand and started doing it with my hand.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t try to move or run away, I think I was just too shocked to do anything. This continued for some time before he said he would give me another hour if I put it in my mouth, I refused again to which he pushed my head down on it.\n\nThat\u2019s all I remember clearly, I know he didn\u2019t go further than that but I don\u2019t exactly remember how it ended. I just remember feeling gross and not touching the DS at all for the rest of the trip.\n\nI\u2019m conflicted about this and posting this here because I don\u2019t really have anyone I can even bring this up to. This happened over 9 years ago and even disregarding the fact that either people won\u2019t believe me or say I wanted it because I didn\u2019t fight back, I don\u2019t want to ruin his life in the case that my family believes me. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s something he wouldn\u2019t even remember as I didn\u2019t even process that it happened until recently so I would be  ruining his current life because of something that happened 9 years ago that ultimately only affects me and not any other people as I doubt he would do it again to someone else.\n\nI doubt this will be read through completely or believed but thanks for a place to vent I suppose.",

Well, apparently some of the men I work with don't like this. I see my boss side eyeing me and coming up with bullshit extra work for her to do. \n\nI also ask another woman I work with if she wants to stay for a drink on most Fridays and she says yes a lot. Sometimes I won't even ask, just mention and she has beer with me. Again, when this happens I see my boss side eyeing me and other coworkers look at me all sulky like they're jealous",

    "postText": "I (21F) am moving out on my own. It\u2019s been long awaited and today is my first day in my new place. My father lived in a really good (expensive) part of Texas, and my mom lived in a dirt poor dangerous city in Texas. I spent every other week with her until she passed last year. I know I\u2019m super privileged and I want to acknowledge that. I say this to give some background. I moved to a relatively good apartment complex close to my dad. So while I don\u2019t have much to worry about im scared. Im not sure what social rules there are, and I know regardless of where im at im not always safe. Dose anyone have any advice on what to do? Rules to follow? Ways to keep myself safe?",

Install a smart doorbell at your front door so that you will know who is ringing on the other side and the smart doorbell will record whatever activity happening outside your new home while you at work\n\n2. Get to know your neighbours, your building manager/landlord and acquaintances in your area so that you guys can look out for each others.\n\n3. Have emergency contacts in your phone\n\n4. Keep your family and friends up to date through texts and calls to let you know you are safe",

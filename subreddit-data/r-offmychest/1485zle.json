    "postText": "Life hasn't always been easy. Emotional neglect from one side of my family, emotional/mental/physical abuse on the other.\n\nThere were so many years I didn't want to live. So much time spent thinking that things would never improve, so why even bother trying. So many years thinking of disappearing and dying young and that the world would just move on.\n\nSpite and love saved me. Spite towards my abuser and love from my current partner. Things got so bad and then surprisingly good.\n\nI had my first dentist appointment in about a decade (shocked to say that they were impressed with my teeth). Same with an optometrist. I got my blood work done and started following the doctors recommendations. GP also wants me to work on my weight a bit, but other than that I'm fairly healthy. The only thing I have yet to do is start therapy which I know I need but had bad experiences with as a kid. I'm still struggling with the social stigma of therapy too.\n\nBut I've made so much growth in the last few years. My personality has changed a bit. I'm more bubbly, less quick to anger. Still super paranoid, but that's one of the things therapy should help with lol. I make friends easily, though I struggle to maintain contact.\n\nI still struggle with the urge to selfharm every once in a while, but it's a lot less frequent. I ate 3 meals a day more consistently. I'm planning on going a gym in the next few months.\n\nI wonder if this is how I could've been my whole life, if things were different. I wonder who I could've been, what I could've done.\n\nIt's better than before and that's all that matters in the end. I'm excited to live.",

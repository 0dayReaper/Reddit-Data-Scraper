    "postText": "Our parents got divorced because my dad tried to unalive my mom when she was pregnant of me. My sister blamed me for ruining her family since my dad went a bit cray cray when they found out I was a girl and not a boy. He wanted a boy. \n\nDuring my sister's childhood the family was still wealthy and she was very spoilt. I am 8 years younger and things were tight during my childhood since my dad never paid maintenance. \n\nAt 7 I started a lemonade stand, selling my old clothes and toys etc. I did this consistently for years almost every weekend. I'm autistic and I didn't and still don't have a lot of friends but I loved having a little stall at my gate and making money. My sister was 15. She started stealing the money I made. She'd also steal any new clothes I got and stretch them when she wore them. \n\n\nWhen I was 8 I got a new bicycle and she was jealous of me and started using it to ride to school. I asked for that for my birthday and Christmas present as my baby bike was too small for me. She already had a bike she got when she was about 9/10. I had that bike until I was 19 so if she thought about it we both had one bike all our childhood from the same age but she never sees things. All she saw was I got a new bike and she didn't. (But she had at my age). \n\nI started to make a decent amount of money and started hiding it from her because it wasn't fair I worked hard and she stole my money. I'd told my mom and she didn't stop my sister taking my money. \n\nMy uncle offered my sister pocket money for working at our family company and she turned it down. She'd steal from the petty cash. I, however, would deliver blinds on my bicycle and attend fitting with him on weekends when I wasn't running my stall and I'd get paid $2. I also washed his car for $2 and I would cook him fried egg sandwiches. All sorts of little odd jobs. I'd always offer my uncles cleaning services for their cars (I thought about this to earn extra cash for myself). \n\n\nWe were in a third world country and eventually my uncles and aunts left due to economic crisis and political unrest. My sister got to go with them. I really suffered with my mom and gran. I kept helping them. My gran got sick there was no medical care. I changed her, bathed her, fed her and still had to go to school and do homework etc.\n\nBy the time I was 18 I wasn't able to go to uni because I couldn't afford it and I had to look after my grandma. When I was 22 I was able to work and pay for online uni and look after my grandma. My sister started uni overseas where she'd moved with the family. When my gran died my mom was a zombie and couldn't work and got sick think partly because of depression. I had to work two jobs to pay the bills and when my mom got hospitalised I had to choose between my next semester fees and my mom's medical fees. I asked my sister for help and she said she couldn't help. I then had to differ from uni. Mom recovered, thank god. \n\nShe inherited the family home but couldn't afford to pay the inheritance tax. I paid for it. It was $14700. \n\nBy this time my sister had been overseas for over 10 years. She got pregnant but was still going to uni. She quit uni two semesters before she qualified and now she's in massive student debt. She said it's because she was depressed about our gran who she'd not visited or helped in over 10 years. \n\nI was the one watching her die before my eyes but somehow whenever my sister spoke to me she'd make it like her life is so much harder than mine and I get given everything easy. \n\nThe country mom and I were living in was getting worse. I found myself pregnant with a special needs child and I decided to leave for the sake of my child. After my daughter was born I waited a few months and got on a plane. (Abortion is illegal where we were by the way and I was forced and couldn't get the morning after pill) so it wasn't a planned pregnancy and I suffered really bad trauma and post natal depression. My sister blamed me for having the baby but she knows abortion is illegal and that I was SA. \n\nI went overseas where my family was. I had $275 when I landed. I worked my ass off doing residential care living in people's homes and caring for them, cooking, cleaning, continence care, personal care etc. I then paid for my mom and daughter to join me. We sold the family home and my mom used that money to live off for the past two years whilst I continued to work and get my little girl specialist care and I went for therapy to get over trauma and be a good mom. \n\nI'm working hard and we have been in a first world country for nearly 4 years. A drunk driver recently totalled my car which was parked. I got a great insurance payout so I took a car on finance and have my dream car which is a BMW X6. I'm working hard and I'm doing online Uni now and working towards a degree. I have a loving and amazing partner who is great with my little girl and we have a nice house we rent. \n\nMy sister said I'm a spoilt brat because I get everything I want in life and she's suffering. She's in debt. She doesn't own her own car. She doesn't have a stable job. Her and her husband borrowed money from me and are refusing to pay it back because they said I'm financially better off than them. She says my whole life I've been spoilt and get everything given to me. She brought up the fact that we had the money from the house. I explained I paid 14700 for it and only got 34000 when we sold it and then my mom used that money to live off (she's still not working). My sister said I'm spoilt because I get free childcare from my mom but my daughter is in daycare from 7am to 5pm daily whilst I'm at work. My sister say I get everything in life but I studying during my lunch break and after work and if I'm not working or studying I'm taking my kid places (she does activities for her development and I pay for that all). \n\n\nMy mom said I should let go of the debt my sister owes me as that's \"only fair\". I don't think it's fair. My mom is also not wanting to work but she has 10 years before retirement age in this country and no pension so she should be working to get money for HERSELF. She also has to pay for her citizenship and passport next year which will be around 5k. I started saving as I know it will be my duty if she hasn't got the money. \n\nI really think I am taken advantage of by people and that my sister doesn't see how I have struggled in life and never been able to have a life for myself and have always had to live to take care of other people. \n\n\nJust wanted to get that off my chest.",

You don't owe her a thing, please consider blocking her from your life. You've had hardship after hardship but you've risen admirably. Please live a great life without your sister in it.",

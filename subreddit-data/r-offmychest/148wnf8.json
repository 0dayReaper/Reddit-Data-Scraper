    "postText": "I approached a girl and complimented her, spoken well.\n\nShe smiled from ear to ear. Her face began to sprinkle with slight mild red as if it were to pop in joy. \n\nA tiny giggle escaped out of her delightful mood, and her voice raised in high pitch then lowered volume; saying thank you with a little bit of difficulty. \n\nUpon seeing this, the emotions of the room poured onto me.\n\nI thought; I was happy it turned out nice. I thanked her for her time and left.\n\n\nBut I turned back around, moments later and asked for her social media.\n\n\nI told her I had no phone at the moment, so:\n\nShe wrote it to me on a small note page and showed her profile to me, as she still fills my surroundings with glee.\n\n\nI followed her and sent her a message.\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIt turned out she never followed back nor replied.",

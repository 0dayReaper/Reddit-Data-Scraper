    "postText": "Admitting that my grades are terrible is a bit embarrassing so I made a little temporary account because I really do feel alone in this. This will be a long read, oopsies. I think a lot.  \n\n\nHow do I describe myself? Well, I know I'm diagnosed with persistent depression and anxiety. I have meds for this. I still struggle to get out of bed everyday because I lack the energy to even try to endure the day. People would call this \"lazy\". I struggled with this ever since I was in high school. A lot of things I got to do is met with \"I don't have the energy for it\". It sounds like excuses, but I meant it. I'm tired all day despite sleeping plenty. People look down on me for this. It definitely doesn't feel good, and I think about it a lot. Oddly telling me to \"just do it\" will make me not want to do the action needed. I think this is executive dysfunction, or plainly depression. Oddly, despite the diagnosis, I feel like there's still something off with me. Like a light switch that is supposed to turn on a light, but there is something interfering with it, so the lights won't turn on.   \nOnto school. I don't party much, drink, or even go out much. Yet, I do terribly. It's my study habits, yes. I've tried everything. I get bored of them. I lack the self-discipline. I know. I just graduated and realized that school was blur. Why did I do so badly despite working hard or even trying? I procrastinate badly. It's so hard to start things mainly. I get distracted so easily while studying. My mind wanders and then I get interested in something else and stay up because I get so engrossed in it. I can't even watch shows anymore because of this. Once I'm into it, time passes so quickly. I think this is hyperfixation. Why can't I just....hyperfixate on my studying then?! I'm mainly frustrated with myself. I get looked down upon by other people and my parents. My grades are so bad so that means I'm dumb. I know this is untrue, my grades don't define me. But...I've been around this type of environment for so long. I've never ever achieved anything \"worthy\" in my life to negate this type of thinking. My friends at least tell me I'm smart, but I don't \"feel\" smart. Maybe, maybe it is true. And the constant comparison is pissing me off because again, there's not much to brag about. There's a trend with my grades though. Any interesting subject I really liked was significantly higher than the rest of the C's I have. I somehow also spent most of my years running a student org, both directly and indirectly. I feel like I wasted my school years since I didn't do internships or anything (I don't have a car to begin with). And I am mostly shy and reserved when it comes to talking to professors. Oh yeah, did I mention my major is competitive? That adds more to the stress plate. Most say grad school is needed, but god I didn't realize I'm *that* inept with my brain back then when I chose a major. I don't know if I can handle this at all and I don't plan to throw myself into grad school until I'm absolutely ready. Some people already told me to just give up and do something else that I'm not really too interested in. I feel so discouraged and I'm tired of using mental illness as an excuse so many times, even though it's true.  \n\n\nI do suspect I'm neurodivergent in some way. I'm currently working on getting diagnosed, though I fear I might not be and just plainly, depressed. Even if this comes true, I still have an issue to solve. It'll be even more frustrating since it'll be a bigger mystery. I'm trying to salvage my GPA. Gotta study the GRE and get experience...I guess this is better than nothing. But I am trying. I know I'm super hard on myself. My brain can't comprehend that I'm mentally ill. I keep thinking that I can trudge through this. Even though nothing is working. I'm working on myself too as I have therapy and such and I've been doing a bit better because of it. I feel like I'm like, in an awkward middle. Constantly. Like I said earlier, I feel like I'm trying to turn on the lights by flicking the light switch, and nothing is turning on. I'm trying to mess with the inner mechanism of the lights but still, nothing is turning on. It's aggravating me. I have no one to blame but myself.  \n\n\ntl;dr: I feel like I am unable to take the next step in my life, which is more schooling. But I suck at school because something isn't clicking in my brain and it's aggravating. I feel so lost because of this. I have a pattern that shows that I am capable but once again, still isn't working. Lots of regrets with my choices to procrastinate and stuff. I wonder if something wrong with me because of this.",

I don't really know what other things that can be done if I stopped what I been working on. But that's a me problem when it comes to it.  \nTraveling sounds fun. Maybe it'll get me out of my shell.

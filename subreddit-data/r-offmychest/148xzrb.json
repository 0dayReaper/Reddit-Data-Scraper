    "postText": "Addie was the first cat I adopted on my own. She was such a sweet girl that was afraid of everyone but me and just wanted to cuddle and sleep all day. A couple years in, I moved back with my parents and she grew an attachment to my sister who has cognitive disabilities. When it came time for me to move out on my own again, I couldn\u2019t bare to separate them so I left her with my sister. \n\nOver the last year, she had health issues arise that her vet couldn\u2019t fully diagnose. We were told it was a thyroid issue and she just kept losing weight and seemed to be gradually wasting away every time I went to visit my family. My sister called me this morning because Addie couldn\u2019t walk anymore. After rushing her to the vet, they said she may have had a stroke during the night and was disoriented. She also believed she had gone blind. Because she couldn\u2019t walk or see, eat or find her litter box, putting her down would be the best option. \n\nI broke down at work before rushing home to figure out how to go about this. I spent several hours with her and she seemed to be in pain, and after watching her deteriorate for the last year, I made the call to have it done. When we got to the vet, they asked if I wanted to be present and I said I couldn\u2019t handle it. I feel so guilty now that she passed without her family present because I was too broken down to be there with her. I was trying to be strong for my sister because I could tell she didn\u2019t grasp the gravity of the situation at the time, but now I feel like I should\u2019ve been there for her final moments and it feels terrible.",

    "postText": "I got off of work and started drinking with some coworkers (I work in a bar) and my friend messaged me telling me she was concerned about our other friend. I messaged his brother, and his brother told me that he shot himself around 11 PM, which is a few hours before I got off.\n\nI\u2019d seen a concerning Facebook post and had messaged him and his girlfriend about it but they didn\u2019t respond. I should\u2019ve called or done more. He\u2019s been trying to hang out with me for weeks and I couldn\u2019t because my work schedule is so hectic, but I should\u2019ve been there. I should\u2019ve been able to talk to him. I should\u2019ve prevented this.\n\nI\u2019m so fucked up right now. While I was having a good time for my birthday, he was dead, and I didn\u2019t know. What do I do for his son? How do I go forward with this? I should\u2019ve been there for him but he never talked to me, and now it\u2019s too late. I feel like shit.\n\nThis isn\u2019t supposed to happen, man. We aren\u2019t supposed to die so young, and I should\u2019ve done more.\n\nI have to be there for his son and his son\u2019s mother. I owe him that much. This is so fucked up.",

    "postText": "So, almost a week ago (tomorrow marks a week), I got my first tattoo. It's of Trico from The Last Guardian and it covers my whole forearm. I've wanted this tattoo since I was 16 (21 now) to cover my self harm scars as the game was my comfort game when my mental health was sky rocketing. I've been saving money for years and something always came up that'd leave me broke, but I finally got it. \n\nNow my friend. She's upset at me for getting my first tattoo before she got hers. I asked her why and her excuse was that I took away her \"bragging rights\". To make her happy, I originally told her that I can wait and book it after she gets hers, but she seemed to be annoyed at that also. It's just a tattoo, yes it's exciting to get them, but I don't see what's there to brag about. Especially since I worked to pay for mine and she's getting her mum to pay for hers.\n\nMy friend told me that she's probably booking hers at the end of this month and I gave her support and let her know how (in my experience) the healing is so far. I also told her that it hurts quite a bit when the shading is being done, because they're going over and over the one spot. She then laughed at me because she thought I \"liked pain\". Don't get me wrong, I do, but it fucking hurts when you've been sitting there for four hours and your skin is irritated as fuck.\n\nThere's some more scars on the back of my arm that I want covered and I've already designed another tattoo for it. It's going to be a pretty big piece that goes from the back of my hand to my elbow. I told her that I'm gonna go in next week when I get paid and book it for the next month or two. She seemed to be heated when I told her that and her messages turned really dry.\n\nShe doesn't care when anyone else gets tattoos, so why is it a problem for me to get them? As far as I see it, it's my body and my money, so I can do what I want with it.",

If so that's disgusting of her to say as if SH is some kink rather than someone suffering \n\n\nDon't let her bully or guilt you into anything. Congrats on your tat as it will be a reminder of moving forward and positivity. I hate to judge your friend but they don't sound too much like a friend",

She also went on about how she'd never get hers covered because then she won't be able to see them, as if that isn't the point of getting them covered. \n\nI've been trying to get rid of her for a while, as there's ALOT of things that she's done that were obviously hurting me. But she always finds a way to come back, if it's messaging me on another platform, or getting one of her friends to contact me.\n\nAlso thank you for the congrats, it means a lot &lt;3",

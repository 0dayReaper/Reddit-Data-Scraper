    "postText": "I'm normally a calm, reasonable person, but in the past month or so, I'm just coming closer and closer to snapping at people who, frankly put, disagree with my political and social viewpoints. I know that's pretty damn childish, and I know I'm probably going to sound pretty high and mighty and self-important in this post in saying that, but I just need to vent.\n\nI'm so tired of the simple desire to help people being seen as this strange thing. I want all people in this country to have equal opportunities, access to shelter, access to food, access to good education, help for their mental health, help for their addictions, free healthcare, just overall an equal opportunity for success and happiness, as close to that as we can get. I want police and justice reform. I want environmental reform. I want a healthy happy country and planet for children to hrow up in.\n\nBut whenever I express this to people, I get scoffed at. I'm just a dumb, lazy millenial that wants free handouts. I should move to another country if the current system bothers me. Minimum wage is too high. Healthcare and college are perfectly affordable, you just don't work hard enough. The justice system is fine, and the cops are all saints; hell, give them more money! Mental health? Eh, you'll be fine. \n\nThis may sound like I'm talking about Trump supports, but this 100% applies to many other parts of the American political system. I'm just so fucking sick of the lack of empathy and the attitude of \"Fuck you, I got mine!\"\n\nI swear, this country is going to turn me into an antagonistic bastard before long.",

One example is all the planning and money that is being put into football players possibly being able to play soon, while school districts are pretty much being left to their own devices on whether to open or not, and the absolute shit show testing is in some cities. \n\nAll I can say is that it\u2019s been a very bleak wake up call for me. Why is money more important than people\u2019s lives and livelihoods?",

Millennials parents overall were growing up in a time that still had a chance at the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d. It was harder for them than it was for their parents and boomers but it was still possible. It felt like the dream was still alive. But millennials grew up during a time when the internet started booming and changed a lot of things. Boomers and their children could open a pharmacy, a mechanic shop, a grocery store and be successful. Millennials that try to do that would have their business eaten up by the larger chains before it gets to open. Millennials grew up hearing about hard work being the path to success and worked their butts off for low, stagnated wages that did nothing to help pay off their massive student loans and prevents them from being able to afford their bills let alone achieving upward mobility. The bubble was burst for Millennials. And then there\u2019s Gen Z and they\u2018re growing up knowing the American Dream is dead from the beginning. The face of the American Dream is no longer a family with home and a comfortable middle class life, it\u2019s now a billionaire CEO saying if you work hard you can achieve this too. It\u2019s unrealistic and this mindset is killing the middle and lower classes in America. And Millennials and Gen Z are tired of it and they\u2019re speaking up about it and bringing attention to the problems that should have been addressed years ago. They want others to recognize the problems too so we can change it and so America has a chance at a better future.",

We dont actually elect the President. The Electoral College does and they can and do often go against the Popular Vote which is the peoples actual votes. Like Im sorry Im pissed about this but Im so fuckin tired of getting labeled a sociopath with zero empathy because I was born and live in a certain country I had and have literally no other choice but to live in, because no one else lets you in unless you meet their really strict criteria. Honestly the truth is there are shitty ass people everywhere in every country that exists.  I mean fuck Im a huge ass Bernie Bro and he was like our one hope of making things a little better. He wants us to have Socialized Healthcare like everyone else. Too bad nobody with any actual power could let him get close to the Presidency. Nobody with any real money wanted him to be President because he believes in taxing them more and of course they need another mansion so nope. Im just increadibly tired and done with people's attitudes because so little of us have any power to change anything. \n\nYou can write and sign every petition that exists. You can protest every single day of the year(and probably will get tear gassed or worse for it) You can write and call every senator/rep until your arms fall off and you're blue in the face, honestly things barely ever change. It took a really long-ass time for women to get rights, for black people to get rights, for gay people to get rights(and those groups are still face a lot of oppression here). I do what I can, the powers that be give no shits, we have barely progressed as a country and I hate it probably as much as you do, but I just notice a very disturbing lack of empathy for the American people as a whole because of a chunk of psychopaths that have some power and influence.",

I did it too when i was young, you kind of get that through movies and tv shows. People in the USA made it feel like it was the greatest country in the world where allll your dreams come true and then soon enough the rest of the world did that too.\n\nEven now, up until this year my mother would still dream about and tell my brother and i that her dream is to live in the US n we should get jobs there. Lol no. No thanks. That was a dream growing up but its certainly not anymore. \n\nEurope would be better. Canada even. Australia. Id much rather live in somewhere where the government doesn't seem out to get me. It doesn't seem very safe over there and its like no problem is ever solved tbh.\n\nAnd its not just a problem with the US. The entire world is also at fault for glorifying the place. Its our own fault for falling into that trap but honestly atm every joke is aimed at the USA. Whether in memes or by americans themselves.  \n\nBut yes. Like OP, im just sick of it. With the lockdown n everything maybe its my patience running thin but id like to vent too. Im sick of it. I really am. I dont even live there but it feels like im an american because i constantly have to hear about their problems. To be fair, its like any problem within the US becomes the entire worlds problem as well. Like allll the time. The entire world has ongoing problems as well but literally its like a global shift of focus. And its almost unavoidable. Because its all over the internet all the time and there's literally no escape.\n\n im not very fond of the country right now. I GENUINELY wish that things improve there. Its 2020 and we shouldn't have to fight for equality anymore yet, here we fucking are. Among every other problem, its just that there's arguing and fighting and never any real proper change. I can understand why people are constantly enraged but its also making people extra sensitive to everything.\n\nJust yesterday i made a light jab towards the US (but, this is all anyone ever does these days anyways? It was just a joke) and someone got offended and insanely triggered, put words in my mouth, basically called me racist then proceeded to make racist assumptions which were wrong. Lol. i couldn't even take them seriously, because there seems to always be an argument or something to be won sometimes. \n\nTheres like the compassionate loving folk then this batch of rubbish people.\n\nBut i am sick of it. I hope things improve for America, because i have a lot of friends living there and they deserve a lot more than this. But i am sick of hearing about the stupidity they're having to deal with. siiiick of It. Enough. lol.\nthe country is really in need of change but im just tired of hearing about them because it sounds like  one side is full of smart young responsible people with love in their hearts vs stupid ignorant racist scumbags who are just selfish and dont know how people work. Its literally good vs. Selfish evil and there's just never an end to it.",

These types of personalities are more popular than you might think. \n\nThe reality is that a significant amount of people find that type of personality attractive and aspirational, the narcissistic sociopathic people who \"tell it like it is\" and really \"live their life without caring what other people think\".  People legitimately think that \"not giving a fuck\" is a desirable personality trait. \n\nConfidence is attractive to people, and some of the most confident people are these sort of narcissistic personalities that have no reason to doubt themselves and constantly deflect criticism in a way that attacks others.  Honestly it really doesn't take much to go from creepy psychopath to adored cult leader, especially once you get the bandwagon going. \n\nI think it's because a lot of people think the way people like Joe Exotic do, but they lack the means, the luck and the commitment to really \"make it\" and get stuck just living their everyday life and being depressed while doing it.\n\nWhen they see someone else who's \"successful\" doing what they wish they could, which is basically being an asshole and getting away with it, they look at them with a kind of hero worship and idolization.  People like to live vicariously though others, and that's exactly what they're doing in cases like this.",

However...\n\n&gt; When they see someone else who's \"successful\" doing what they wish they could, which is basically being an asshole and getting away with it, they look at them with a kind of hero worship and idolization\n\nThis is a key factor regarding Trump\u2019s cult that I don\u2019t see translating to Joe Exotic. A huge part of Trump\u2019s appeal with many of his voters was his obscene wealth, which people in the US worship and take to signify success (Trump is *actually* quite a shit businessman, but that requires critical thinking to notice, which his fans appear to lack). Joe was not particularly wealthy, nor did he particularly get away with being an asshole (probably because, again, his wealth/status isn\u2019t even in the same universe as Trump\u2019s). It\u2019s apples and oranges for a lot of reasons.\n\nPlus, as I said before, I haven\u2019t really encountered anyone who legitimately, earnestly supports Joe Exotic. Before you counter with a \u201cthey exist\u201d - sure, I bet some do, but my point is that so few do that it\u2019s probably not a great use of one\u2019s time to get worked up about it. I\u2019ve seen infinitely more posts complaining about these people than the people the posts are railing against. That\u2019s my overarching point here. It isn\u2019t even that I\u2019m annoyed with people for posting this kind of thing - I just sort of feel bad for them losing their shit over what seems to me a fairly normal looking blip, pop-culture-wise.",

Also, the fact that some people think they have enough information and data provided by a film alone to decide that a person killed their husband is honestly embarrassing. \n\nThe fact animal abuse was shown on screen yet relegated to the sidelines bothered me more than the character assassinations. There are many more issues with big cat ownership ( that Big Cat Rescue has addressed in other media) like declawing that were never mentioned. Based on my prior knowledge of Big Cat Rescue, I do not for a second believe it is comparable to Joe's exotic roadshow.\n\nI also hate how the documentary painted all zoos with the same brush, ignoring the rigorous standards accredited zoos must meet. I'm clearly biased though,  I grew up with parents who worked at a world renowned zoo.",

They mean to say a person suspected of attempted murder, fraud, animal abuse, and a whole bunch of shit too onerous to list is the same as someone who is portrayed circumstantially and in a biased fashion to be *plausibly* guilty (and highly unlikely given the evidence conveniently not mentioned by the documentary) of committing murder are similar degrees of bad?

So I take back what I said- if those people are happy to be there (which I would be too) then I'd say that's fair enough, 100%. I take it back.",

It has changed its practices over time to comply with increased understanding about care-taking ethics, although it is still utilizing primarily volunteers to interact with the animals. Volunteers that spend years training, but are not licensed veterinarians and may not necessarily have the requisite academic backgrounds (important for staying abreast of new research into behavior and health of these animals) required by other non-profit zoos and research centers. I don\u2019t know how the changes in that org  relate to Carol personally  (I\u2019m assuming as a well-rated non-profit it has an involved decision-making board, and transparent structures and finances), but regardless of how frustrating, cloying, annoying Carol may be I was frustrated that the documentary-makers still managed to leave viewers with an impression that that organization was equitable to creep-run groups like Doc Antle or Joe Exotic. I would have really liked to see experts in large cat captivity interviewed and asked to compare the organizations, as most of the viewers (myself included) really have no base of understanding to know what is and isn\u2019t appropriate, so we are left to make judgement calls based on the name-calling of these bizarre, clearly biased bunch of individuals.",

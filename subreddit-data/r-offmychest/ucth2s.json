    "postText": "I\u2019m kind of insecure about my body. I\u2019m not obese or horribly overweight but I know I could stand to lose a few pounds. I\u2019ve been nervous about being naked in front of her, especially since she\u2019s so stunning. \n\nThis is a pretty new relationship and we had sex for the first time today. It was amazing and we fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms afterwards. When we woke up and it was time to get up and dressed she was just staring at me and my body. I asked her \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\nShe got up and walked over to me, took my face in her hands, kissed me and said \u201cyou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d\n\nI started crying grown man tears right there and she just kept kissing me all over my face. She guided me back down to the bed and let me lay my head on her and cry. She rubbed my back, wiped my tears, kissed my forehead, and just held me.\n\nAs a black man I don\u2019t often feel like I\u2019m allowed to have emotions and be vulnerable but she makes me feel so safe.\n\nMy girlfriend made me cry today and I\u2019ve never felt more loved.",

Unless you're the Terminator, hiding these emotions will lead to bottling up, which leads to things like depression, or so much built up rage, you'll snap on an innocent trying to rip off the bottle cap. I can speak from experience that it never ends well in these circumstances. I'm glad you found someone that can bring these feelings out of you as someone does for me.

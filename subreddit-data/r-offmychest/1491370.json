    "postText": "I\u2019m on mobile please forgive the formatting and the long winded story.\n\nI just need to write to hopefully feel better about my situation. I started dating someone I thought was really wonderful. He consistently showed up for me emotionally in many ways for the ~ 3 months we were dating. He communicated well, expressed how much he liked me and consistently proved himself to be someone I can start to trust my feelings with. \n\nEverything was going great. We talked about past relationships. He mentioned that his most recent ex consistently thought he was cheating when he wasn\u2019t and berated him with fights. How it was just an awful relationship and he\u2019s really working on himself to be a better man for his next relationship. He talked about us potentially being in a relationship and generally how we are headed towards that direction. \n\nThis was a topic I needed clarification on because the wording he used originally was a little confusing. We had a little discussion on where we were at and at some point I had used words that triggered him. Normally communicative, he went silent for most of a couple days until I had to ask what was going on. He said he felt triggered and had somewhat of an anxiety attack, having to leave work early because he couldn\u2019t focus. I felt very bad for triggering him and apologized. We talked most things out through text (because he was reluctant to talk on the phone) and it felt like things were okay again with mutual understanding. \n\nSince that triggering event I could feel him pulling away and at one point wanted to confront it but decided to give him time to adjust. It never happened so after nearly a week, I had to bring this up; I felt so lonely and anxious. It was eating me up inside that I did something to hurt our relationship. He explained that the triggering words brought back so many awful memories from his ex and it made him realize he may not be ready for a relationship. He felt guilty for making me anxious and admits that he has noticed himself pulling away. He understands in reality this wasn\u2019t a big issue but is having a hard time getting over it. I can sense that he is now starting to have an avoidant behavior. He was reluctant to talk on the phone to communicate and was generally very difficult to communicate with. It\u2019s like a switch flipped and he\u2019s now shutting down. I tried my best to support him and not push him because I wanted him to communicate his needs and thoughts more. He ended up wanting a break from us dating (I also gave him the options of just not dating anymore or to keep dating while we work on his issues), realizing he\u2019s inherited a toxic trait from his last relationship (being avoidant). I supported that decision and just asked for a timeline. He never responded and it was a week of silence before I messaged how we can stop dating and be friends instead because of the personal issues he needs to work on. I just wanted him to please let me know if he\u2019s physically okay and I won\u2019t bother him. But still no response. \n\nI feel like Ive been ghosted and it sucks ass. All the time we spent getting to know each other and having our feelings grow just ended so abruptly and without closure. I guess advice is warranted on what to do next? I\u2019m still worried about him because of such a bizarre change in behavior.",

Try to focus on really taking care of yourself right now. Do the things you enjoy doing and focus on your own goals, hobbies, etc. I know it sucks but if it's meant to be, it will. If it's not, then there is someone better out there for you.",

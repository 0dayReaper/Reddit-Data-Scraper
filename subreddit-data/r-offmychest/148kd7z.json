    "postText": "I\u2019m a mom of two, and 30yo, and this will be my first abortion.       \nI thought I\u2019d feel overwhelming guilt and fear, but all I feel is mild irritation that I\u2019m feeling pregnancy symptoms. I caught it quick, noticing the signs almost immediately, and track my sex life and cycle religiously, so I know when the conception happened.      \n\nI feel fairly \u201cmeh\u201d about it, and that\u2019s probably because this is the first time I\u2019ve been pregnant *and* safe at the same time.        \n\nI was assaulted at 10, and became pregnant. I was in small Texas town, and could not get help. I eventually miscarried alone, and moved on with my life.      \n\nMy ex-husband was/is abusive, and every time I was pregnant, his abuse ramped up. I felt so much fear and shame, and I was desperate to keep my babies while also wanting to abort, but had no choice either way.     \n\nNow that my kids are older, and I\u2019m in a stable, healthy relationship, most of what I feel is mild relief that I can get to a clinic fairly quickly. My partner has made it clear with actions and words that he\u2019ll support my decision either way.      \n\nWe can afford another child, but it\u2019s just not the right time. Plus, I\u2019ve never had free time for myself before, and I\u2019m reluctant to give up that freedom again.      \n\nI\u2019m just happy that I\u2019m not drowning in grief, and feel pretty neutral about it all.",

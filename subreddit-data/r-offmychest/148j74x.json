    "postText": "So, finally I land this big job I've been waiting all year for and I'm stoked. For all of a few minutes at least. For some reason now that I've actually secured the job it's like the next big thing I desire has been brought to the forefront. Don't get me wrong internally I'm over the moon but I'm also wrestling with the feeling of this more intense desire now given breathing space. That desire is to actually fall in love. The desire to intertwine my life and being with someone else. Doing life together. \n\nI'm a guy who has had zero problems with the opposite sex since a child. As I've grown however these fleeting sexual encounters with women I find sexually attractive but wouldn't ever consider them to be wife material is beginning to drain me. Mind body and soul. It's almost a waste of my time at this point. Getting to know them just to sleep with them then on to the next women. This seems like a fools game and it doesn't foster the deep happiness I'm looking for. I don't bother sharing myself completely to anyone simply because I know I won't be sticking around. I feel like I'm using women as drugs and I don't like that feeling.\n\nWhy aren't these women I'm talking to wife material? Well, they either have kids/a kid, have been promiscuous in the past, I'm not all that intriguing by them mentally, there's something about their personality I find to be irritating after a while. All of which are hard no's for me. What I should be doing is talking to women who don't have any of theses hard no's who I'm also sexually attracted to. I can't say I haven't seen any of them because I haven't really been looking for it, more so just to have sexual encounters. \n\nI'm rambling at this point but I needed to get this off my chest. I don't want to be out here chasing after all kinds of women for sex, I'm just looking for suitable partners at this point.",

If the child is still relatively young and somehow divinely she ticks every other requirement I have it'll be foolish to write such a woman off. Funnily enough single mothers tend to be more wife material in the sense that they know their way around keeping a house in order, being supportive and resilient. In my experience they do however also love their independence and their routine as they've been the leader of their home. Rightly so. But ideally she'd be without a child.",

I do feel currently like I would never be able to fully trust anyone and always have a guard up at this point. After 11 years with the man I loved and being discarded like this it's difficult not to feel like the other shoe would always have potential for dropping. But im in therapy and I'm sure I will cover that at some point. \n\nI know I'm valuable, I'm independently successful, manage my own home and all expenses, im a vice president, and I'm a cutie haha. I'm also a musician and very creative and very adventurous and love to get out and have fun. I think one of the biggest issues was that my ex was always in competition and insecure and I believe my success and income became far too much for him to deal with. So I wonder what kind of man I can find that won't be threatened by me and will be a good nice human. Hopefully one day.",

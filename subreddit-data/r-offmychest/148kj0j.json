    "postText": "First time really talking about this and feels to embarrassing to talk to my friends about it but here we go\n\nI (29m) have fallen for my(30f, will refer to her as 'ch') friend of 18 years, we met when a family friend was dating ch's brother. We instantly hit it off and became friends doing everything together  from watching movies, sleep overs and even our first time drinking together during those times I will admit I did have a crush on her them.\n\nAfter some time me and ch lost contact with each of us focusing on our lives and careers. During those years I had various life threatening medical conditions happening and couple of failed relationships that affected my self esteem and mental health which as pathetic as it sounds forced me out of my industry by my own fault.\n\nLate last year, we met up for the first time in 9 years at a gathering and since then we've spent every week getting dinner and catching up, she's even planned something for us to do for my birthday in 3 months without me bringing it up.\n\nWith all that in mind, it snapped in my mind how important she is to me and I realised that we're both are not in the same stages of life, feeling like I don't want to drag her down and giving her any unnecessary stress by telling her how I feel and not knowing her reaction by possibly ruining a friendship.\n\nI know I've left some things out but this is already a long post and I don't know if this is appropriate to post here but yeah",

    "postText": "Last weekend i went to drink and have fun with my friends and it all started well. We went to listen some music in festival or what ever and had a blast. We drank, i danced with some ladies and stuff until i was so drunk we had to leave. So as we were leaving i started to mentally break apart and i was kinda sad but there was to much of it bottled up so it just turned to anger and rage. As i was basically throwing shit around my friends tried to calm me down and i was so fucked up and angry i just started choking my friend. My brother and other friends tried to stop me but i started to beat them and throw around until they got me on ground and calm down. After that i passed out and woke in car going home passed out again and woke in bathroom. Had another break down and beated bathroom wall until i was stopped.\n\nI feel like shit because this isnt first time and i shouldnt have done that to my friends and brother only people i truly care about. I also feel like im just shittiest friend and brother in the world.\n\nI could write about so many more stuff but i suck at writing in english so sorry if somebody reads this.",

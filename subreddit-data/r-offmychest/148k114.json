    "postText": "I've literally become a bad person. A terrible person. I'm not proud of it. I've become someone people are afraid of blocking me because they think I'm gonna show up at their house and do them bad like punching, or maybe unaliving. I don't wanna be like this. I want to be like how I used to be, someone who cares about others, someone who will be positive no matter what. I used to love myself, I used to love life even tho I didn't have the best family or friends I believed everything would be alright. I've become someone agressive and someone who can't hold their anger inside. It's not only affecting me but the others too. \n\nBut why did I become like this? I put my guard down for someone I shouldn't have, I trusted the person many times, at least I tried it. I've always kept my guard up for everyone to protect myself. I guess it's my own fault for putting my guard down even tho I was betrayad many times by the same person. I just wanted someone to take care of me like how I took care of others. Just someone to ever respect me, listen to my words or my feelings, just someone who treats me like I'm worth it. Everyone's mad at me because I've become a bad person but no one's think about their action towards me till it's too late. \n\nWhy is everyone expects me to respect them and let them do whatever they want but no one ever respects me? Why is it OK to do treat me like whatever they feel like but when I do it back it's a problem? Why is it so hard for someone to just treat me like I deserve to be treated? Or at least like a human being who actually has feelings? Can someone just treat me like how I want to be treated? \n\nI really wanna be back me again. I want the healed me and I don't know how to do it, because no one takes me ever serious and I really need someone to show me that they love me and that I'm worth it.\n\nI wanna start by forgetting that person and everything he has done to me that let me become like this.",

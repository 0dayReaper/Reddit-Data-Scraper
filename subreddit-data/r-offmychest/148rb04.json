    "postText": "TW: sexual harassment, mentions of suicide and self harm (briefly)\n\nbasically what the title says. ever since i was 11, i was sexualized by \u201cfriends\u201d i knew online. i\u2019m 17 now and i\u2019m so fucking angry that it happened. the PTSD haunts me from time to time.\n\nit was mainly through art. these \u201cfriends\u201d would draw porn of me and got pushy with NSFW art requests, they wouldn\u2019t leave me the fuck alone until i did it. some of it is even posted online and it makes me want to kill myself.\n\neveryone involved back then were minors, but regardless, i fucking hate them all for doing that to me. i hate them for thinking it was automatically ok to do because we were friends. the last time i remember it happening was when i was 14, but who knows, maybe my groomer (20M) drew porn of me behind my back. thinking about it makes me want to kill myself as well. i don\u2019t need that shit again, especially from an adult.\n\ni also hate myself for not telling them to stop or else i\u2019ll block them. i hate myself for being ok with it. it\u2019s so traumatizing to thinking about and i\u2019m about to flip. i wish i would stop acting like this but i can\u2019t get help right now. i will when i can.\n\ni don\u2019t even know if this was harassment, i\u2019m that stupid. i feel so gross. i feel gross because people wanted to see me like that. i feel gross because i didn\u2019t say anything. i wish people wouldn\u2019t look at me in that way.\n\ni feel sick as i write this. i think i\u2019m going to relapse into self harm again, the urge is so bad. why did this have to happen.",

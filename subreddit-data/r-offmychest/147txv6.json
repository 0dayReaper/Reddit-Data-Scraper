    "postText": "\n\nI\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for 6 months and recently, he started doing things I don\u2019t feel comfortable with. He always touches me in public and doesn\u2019t respect my boundaries. \n\nFor example, we\u2019re outside or in public transportation, and he\u2019ll start touching or massaging my boobs or my ass. He also takes my hands and caress his body with it. People can see it and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with that at all. He knows that I\u2019m a reserved, introvert person and I\u2019m not into that. I told him plenty times, but he makes it look like it\u2019s a joke. He thinks that it\u2019s funny. He tells me that I\u2019m no fun and exaggerating.\n\nHe\u2019s doing the same inside, I\u2019m trying to study for an exam, and he\u2019ll start putting his hands between my legs, even if I tell him, not right now. He laughs at it and it takes time for him to finally stop.\n\nHe thinks that I\u2019m making a big deal about something that\u2019s not a issue. Is he right ? Or is it fair for me to see that as weird and an issue ?",

That\u2019s why he\u2019s laughing. He does it in public to humiliate you; expecting that you won\u2019t make a scene and he can do what he wants. Gaslighting allows him to deny what he\u2019s definitely doing. He likes having power over you.\n\nEventually, he\u2019ll escalate.",

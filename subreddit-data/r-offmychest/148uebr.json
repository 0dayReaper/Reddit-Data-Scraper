Like I wish I could just be somewhere in the middle. Idk it seems like between life and death there\u2019s something peaceful.\n\nI still have the notebook where I wrote down every thought and feeling I had while I was going through SH and during what felt like the worst time in my life. I always get tempted to read it and see how I\u2019ve grown as a person, but it\u2019s kinda scary. I\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll fall back into old habits again, I mean there\u2019s been times where I\u2019ve been tempted to relapse again.\n\nIt just kinda sucks, I\u2019ll never really be fully recovered I\u2019ll always be (number) days clean or y weeks, months years. But I can\u2019t really blame anyone but myself.\n\nI feel much happier now than I was, a little bit hopeful too. Even feel more confident in myself.\n\nBut yeah. It feels really hard to go further but nothing in life is ever really easy.",

Whatever you've been doing the past 5 weeks seems to be doing you good, so I wouldn't say you need to strive for more honestly. \n\nBeing happy each and everyday is unrealistic, yet what a lot of people depict as an end goal in mental health. But if you can describe your state of mind at the moment as more or less peaceful then that's fantastic and something to be cherished. Feeling peace is something a lot of people don't feel too often these days. This isn't to say you shouldnt expect to feel happy and that this is it (I don't know if what I'm saying could be misconstrued that way).\n\nI can't really say what you should do with your notebook. But while it may be tempting to use it as a measure of your progress, in my experience happiness and contentment are fleeting and can be found in just little things quite frequently in the present rather than in one's life as a whole or when compared with past. So when you share a laugh with a family or friend, or when you find a show/book/hobby that brings you joy or satisfaction, take a moment longer to bask in it and pursue those things.\n\nBut again, what you're doing now is doing wonders, so keep doing it! So proud of you!\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

I know that the journey to good mental health isn\u2019t by any means quick or easy, but it\u2019s important to remember that each step counts. You have made amazing progress, even if you haven\u2019t quite reached your goal yet you are closer than you were and that is something to be proud of.",

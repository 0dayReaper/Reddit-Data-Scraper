    "postText": "I spent two years planning for his 50th birthday and our anniversary in a location he\u2019d never been, full of activities I knew he\u2019d love.  He was excited.  He didn\u2019t listen to me, on the first day, didn\u2019t put sunscreen on and now can\u2019t walk or leave the room. What was supposed to be 7 days in paradise was 1 fun day and 6 days of him in the room unable to walk.  Not able to do any of our planned activities.  I\u2019ve had fun alone, but this was supposed to be a couples trip.  Today is his birthday.  I\u2019ve literally fetched three meals for him.  And he\u2019s made cracks about me drinking, standing, sleeping\u2026  I feel like I\u2019m married to a child mixed with a 100 year old.  It\u2019s never his fault (he\u2019s literally blaming the position of the sun).  He blames, projects, and explodes.  This trip is a culmination of frustration for me, not sure what to do next.",

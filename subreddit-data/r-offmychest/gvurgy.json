Even if they don't want to say these things out loud, Trump will. They see it as a redeeming quality rather than the bad one it is.\n\nA lot of people I thought were friends or at least people I didn't mind associating myself with who, as it would turn out, happened to be closeted misogynists, racists, and homophobes did not start voicing these opinions publicly until Trump gave them a platform to, and it's no surprise that they support him. In their eyes, and the eyes of many of his supporters, he made being these things \"cool,\" for a lack of a better word. He has built a community around hate, and nothing brings a certain group of people together more than tearing other groups of people down.\n\nWhen we and other normal people with things like empathy and compassion see the things Trump do and say, we are disgusted, and as such we imagine his supporters would be and that they must just no hear them. Unfortunately, it's quite the opposite: many of them hold the same views he does and (sometimes) restrain themselves from repeating the things he says in public more so for fear of being judged and losing their status in society than they do because they're appalled by it like the rest of us.",

Shit. \n\nTrying to argue with them just goes in circles because any concept more complicated than \"taxes bad\" and \"freedom good\" is absolutely wasted. They don't understand what the federal government does and they don't care. They don't know what the president's job is and they don't care. They dont care about foreign relations because they don't understand that our relationship with other countries effects us or frankly that other countries exist in any meaningful way. \n\nPhrases like \"military industry complex\" and \"fascism\" and \"authoritarian tactics\" are as alien to them as quantum physics is to the rest of us. It is a genuine waste of time to spare them a thought unless you are a middle school social studies teacher and you plan on giving them lessons.\n\nEDIT: This is, of course, exempting the Ben Shapiros and Candace Owens who are media savvy grifters who have no scruples about misleading their audiences for personal gain",

Breonna Taylor who was murdered due to a \u201cno knock\u201d warrant?\n\n&gt;they are business people who want deregulation\n\nThese are just the people with massive platforms who want smaller government. There are many, many, more people with smaller platforms who want smaller government for civil liberties. Ending the war on drugs, legalizing gay marriage, relaxing immigration laws, allowing gay/trans couples to adopt, and allowing twitter to fact check trump, are all examples of small government.\n\nI should add [this](https://www.economicshelp.org/macroeconomics/inflation/causes-inflation/) to help explain inflation. Deregulation of business is not a primary cause of inflation. Constant inflation is a good thing but you are right that it needs to be restrained. Regulation can have negative effects as it creates barriers to entry, limiting competition and thus causing monopolization\n\n&gt;His tax cuts focus on wealthy\n\nYes this is correct, and is mostly seen in corporate tax rates. This is trickle down economics, which is an inconsistent principle to say the least.",

There are enough enablers at this point in teh Senate and even the Supreme Court that I am no longer comforted by any \"that won;t happen\" sentiments.\n\nTeargassing and *beating* peaceful protesters in front of the White House, flying military helicopters just a few dozen feet above protests as a show of military force, and threatening to use the US military against its own citizens with comments like \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\" wasn't supposed to *fucking* happen either, and here we are.\n\nThe military *and* police are supposed to disobey unlawful orders. They have not.\n\nThe Senate is supposed to give the President a fair impeachment trial.  They did not.\n\nEvery single safeguard we set up in this country, everything that made us feel safe in our Democracy, has been systematically removed by this orange shitstain and his oathbreaking, self-serving enablers.\n\nWe had major problems before Trump, but he's been working to amplify all of it.  Police violence, especially against people of color, was already reprehensibly bad.  Trump *encouraged more of it.*  \"Should have roughed him up more.\"  \"Maybe don't be so gentle.\"\n\nIf I were still a religious person, i'd be seriously considering Trump to be a candidate as the Antichrist, without hyperbole.  He makes a mockery of *everything* of value.  He has no morals, no ethics.  He uses sacred symbols as props.  he ues the Constitution as a prop.  He throws out the 2nd Amendment as a prop.  And he actively works *against* the most sacred rights of Americans, including the right to free speech, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, the right to be free from unreasonable seizures, the right to due process.\n\nFuck this guy *so hard.*  I don;t like Biden, but I hope Biden wins, and I hope at his inauguration he *spits in Trump's face* rather than shake his hand, and then promptly orders Trump arrested the moment he's no longer protected by executive privilege.  Assuming Trump doesn;t try an *actual military coup,* which I do not put past him, because there *is no bottom.*",

I'm not even what I'd consider to be a \"real Christian\" and I probably live the Bible every day more than the very people who taught it to me.",

His claims of fake news from democrats means that he's trying to censor democratic media. He's creating a divide between Americans that may incite more violence than we've ever seen. I wouldn't be surprised if civil war broke out.\n\nI would argue that he has created a new party altogether rather than lead as a conservative, and many conservative leaders agree. This man isn't a Republican. The people who support him aren't republicans either. These are people who don't care about you, and would much rather invade your privacy than stay away from it from paranoia.\n\nTrump and his party don't care about you. We can clearly see as death tolls from Covid and rioting climb each and every day that their primary concern is getting reelected. Trump actively told people to drink bleach and to let sunlight heal the body. His party will spout as many lies and create as much voter bias as possible to win. This next election isn't about democrats versus republicans. This is now about voting to save lives at this point. \n\nCome election time, take a day off. Volunteer to drive folks to voting booths.

It's full of vitriol, nonfactual information, narcissism, and off-the-cuff insanity. Go watch any one of his press conferences. He self-indicts himself, but he has such a cult of personality around him of people who have put so much of themselves into supporting him that his support is unwavering. He's a demagogue in the truest sense of the word. Beyond that, he does *flagrantly* illegal things, but because the GOP has rallied behind him, he gets away with all of it. Famously, Senators like Susan Collins have voted against rebuking, impeaching, or indicting him, with the excuse of, \"I'm sure he's learned his lesson\". Wikipedia is a great place to start. Everything on every page about him is sourced. Some people will tell you that Wikipedia has a liberal bias; it doesn't. If it does, it's because reality is biased against modern American Conservatism.\n\nAs an aside, Trump's policies haven't helped the economy as much as most people think. The economic trend upwards began with Obama's economic recovery package coming off of the 2008 crash, and it's been steadily trending upwards since. Another major aspect of this is that the \"economy\" is no longer tied to reality, nor does it work for the middle and lower class; despite horrific job loss, supplychain interruptions, etc, the stock market continues to rise due to the Federal Reserve injecting unlimited liquidity in the market. This is effectively allowing people who have money not to lose money, while people who don't have money grind to a standstill. During the COVID lockdown, American billionaires made an additional $500 billion. Our economy is strong only for the top 1%, for whom it is utterly and completely rigged.",

Unfortunately he has never been able to give a speech like this in his entire presidency.",

Confidential satellite imagery has been tweeted from his account in the past, among other things. \n\nIt\u2019s more obvious with his COVID response, which was basically to tell states that they should figure it out themselves, and then sabotage public health by advocating for the lifting of HIS OWN restrictions once he got bored and blaming it on The Other.\n\nA good start would be to visit his twitter page and watch his speeches to get an idea of his base and his personal opinions. The most recent one is...a trip. \n\nCase in point: these are not the traits of a stable person. Many competent leaders have the power of introspection and analysis. He seems incapable.",

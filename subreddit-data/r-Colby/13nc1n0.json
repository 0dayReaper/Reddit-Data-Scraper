If you want to have fun, there are lots of options but it all involves driving at least 40 mins to the closest \u201cfun\u201d place. Of course, you can drive longer to go further but there is absolutely nothing to do in Waterville.",

Made a poor choice during COVID\n\nI\u2019m generally at peace with my decision to go to Colby after two years here, but given the chance I would 100% change my decision in a heartbeat. After a year, transferring just seemed like two much work when I had already found friends here, and the thought of meeting new people somewhere else in my sophomore year was scary. \n\nI can see Colby definitely being a good fit for certain people, whether you ski a lot or are into Econ or ES, but I really had no reason to go here and that is reflected in my lack of enjoyment. So, not necessarily any blame on the school, just a genuine learning experience for me.\n\nGoing to Colby ironically taught me how much I really love cities and urban living, and how much I can\u2019t stand the rural/suburban living like in Waterville. I never got to tour college campuses because of COVID, among many other things, so I never really got to appreciate the differences between the different colleges I was accepted to. I obviously knew Colby was far away from major cities, but I feel my perspective was just really warped by being in COVID lockdown for a year and not having been on campus. I wish I had gone to a school that was in Boston or closer to a city (like Vassar is only an hour and a half away from NYC). Maine is such a beautiful state, but I could never live here and the thought of spending three more semesters there (I\u2019m abroad in the fall) is not the best feeling haha.\n\nIt was at first comforting that Colby reminded me of high school, but by my second year it became annoying. You can\u2019t avoid people, and campus feels very cliquey and indistinguishable from a suburban Massachusetts high school. The community feels very weak and non existent. We have literally no school culture/spirit besides one day a year, doghead. Small student population sounded attractive to me on paper as a high school senior bc I thought it would foster a greater sense of community, but all it has meant at this point is that at a certain point, you\u2019ve run out of people to meet which sucks when you don\u2019t have opportunities to make new friends and you\u2019re familiar with most people in your class.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of things I could go on about in my personal life that have also led to me not loving this school. It hasn\u2019t been all bad, and I\u2019ve generally felt fulfilled academically and have made nice connections with faculty, and love my friends. But I really wish I had gone almost anywhere else.",

I don\u2019t drink and I felt like an outlier in that regard. I think there are some really smart kids who care about school, but there are also a lot of spoiled kids who make partying their life. \n\nI was also really disappointed with the quality of education. The school preaches small class sizes and interactive learning. In reality, I only had one class with fewer than 30 kids. Most of my classes were about 40 kids. I think part of this is due to the school over enrolling. I had several classes where I made an effort to get to know my professor, but there were just so many kids that I felt lost in the crowd. The larger class sizes also meant most of my professors just threw power points onto the screen and lectured. I don\u2019t think this type of teaching is a bad thing, but I would have gone to a school with 10,000 kids and not 2,200 if I wanted classes to be like this.\n\nOverall, I really think that you\u2019re paying for the degree and connections when you go to Colby. In my case, I think a great college experience and education will benefit me most, and I didn\u2019t find that at Colby.",

Because this is the exact opposite of my Colby experience.\n\nI would agree that partying is very big. But I find that to be a problem only in Sunday and Saturday nights for non-partying people, and that is only if majority of your friends party.\n\nAbout class size, my most crowded class so far was about 40 people which was CS231. And I still get to crate a meaningful connection with my professor. And lectures were effective imo.\n\nAnd about the cost, I can't make a statement cause I'm on full financial aid.\n\nIt's interesting that we all experience the same place very differently. Hope you are satisfied with where you are right now.",

There is absolutely no verifiable information, ~~there\u2019s no arrest record for Pamela~~  *CORRECTION: There is - she is claiming she was found in another county 50 minutes away, but the arrest records clearly show she was arrested by WPD*, and try as I might I can\u2019t find evidence of any of the other accusations being leveled. Someone claimed their brother was killed in the \u201cRape Basement\u201d and there are no records of that either.\n\nThe conspiracy would either have to go all the way to the state police to continue to be this covered up considering the case is clearly multijurisdictional, or it\u2019s BS",

It's an \"ongoing investigation,\" not a true crime, after-the-fact run-through of an incident, beginning to end.  As someone with a legal background, Pamela is surely being careful about what details she does and does not release, in the hopes of protecting her case. The police told her to keep quiet, but since they were literally doing nothing and wouldn't return her phone calls, Pamela decided her ONLY option was to go public with her story. You can't even begin to understand how hard that must have been for her. She has put herself in a vulnerable position and shared god-awful details of what happened to her with anyone who can read. And thank god she did because many other victims have come forward with eerily similar experiences. Can you take 2 guesses as to why victims don't come forward? Jerks always trying to \"poke holes\" in stories. \ud83d\ude44\n\nYou CAN see something from Pamela herself. Go to her Facebook page. She has PUBLICLY posted her story ---&gt;&gt; [https://www.facebook.com/pamela.boivin.7/posts/pfbid0UixCocbRLuq3BbGZrNwLocMCihanEujpwTVrEFW6iifgXg3SFU432GyUJGJB1Kyul](https://www.facebook.com/pamela.boivin.7/posts/pfbid0UixCocbRLuq3BbGZrNwLocMCihanEujpwTVrEFW6iifgXg3SFU432GyUJGJB1Kyul) \n\nShe has listed what happened to her, the charges she's facing as well as the fact that the chief of police, detectives and sex crimes detectives have all refused to meet with her. Most of this is public on her page, some may only be visible by her friends (like me). \n\nColby students should be especially careful. It's my understanding that it's fairly regular that they obtain fake IDs to go out to the bars in Waterville. If something like this could happen to a 55-year-old woman mid-day, it can certainly happen to drunk college girls at night.",

                            "comment": "When the holes are big enough to drive a car 50 miles into another county, yeah, people are going to question. These aren't \"holes\" because there's missing information, these are holes of provably false information. To quote a comment on Facebook someone posted:\n\n\"The dead man in the basement is simply non-existent. I cannot find a single shred of evidence or a news report or ANYTHING.\n\nThe claim that this is out of the Maine State Police\u2019s jurisdiction simply is untrue, based on the details of the location. If she was found in another county, the state police would have to be involved as it\u2019s multi-jurisdictional. If it was another town but not another county, the county LEO would be involved. The claims about her locations do not make sense. She claims that she was drugged and assaulted in Waterville, 10 min from her home, and yet was arrested 50 minutes from he home in another county. If you find look at police logs, she was arrested by Waterville PD. Waterville doesn\u2019t spam a county line or even take 40 minutes to cross. I don\u2019t understand why that isn\u2019t raising red flags for citizens here either.\n\nAdditionally, the details about where she was attacked keep changing. This has been posted to Reddit and her friend claimed that she was drugged at Silver Street Tavern, but this post references the place as Cancun, based on the owner\u2019s arrests for immigration ***fraud and the false claims there were people in Cancun's basement, which is false, it was a different restaurant. So which is it? Cancun or SST? (addition me)***\n\nFinally, if her bank account was drained by her attacker as she claimed, that would be a federal crime to the best of my knowledge. So either the feds, the state police, and the county police are also involved in this conspiracy, or a lot creative liberties have been taken.\"\n\nCan you address some of these discrepancies? As a victim myself, and as someone who works with victims to get justice, I want to believe victims and there is a LOT of police corruption, but this raises some very good points, especially with her claim she was in another county 50 minutes away but arrested by Waterville PD. Additionally, people are now starting to accuse Colby of paying literally everyone involved off, and other people are coming out of the woodworks to say that they work in law enforcement and they haven't heard reports of anything remotely similar to what she's claiming.",

She asked one of my friends, who has very strict privacy settings \u201chow she knew her\u201d and my friend is afraid to respond because she doesn\u2019t know how Pamela got through to her. \n\nAnd I am afraid to be \u201cme\u201d on here because I have admitted things I wouldn\u2019t post on Facebook, like severe mental health struggles or details of my own assaults and abuse. This is my college subreddit, and you using my name makes it VERY easy for anyone to connect the dots as to who I am. You know that, quit playing dumb. You are just upset that people aren\u2019t full-stop believing random things they read online written by complete strangers. \n\nI have explained on Facebook why I and others are reluctant to believe something written in such a conspiratorial tone as Pamela chose to write her post in. As someone who has dealt with assault and sexual violence, I didn\u2019t choose to post it online, anonymously,\nto forums of strangers while writing in the most damn confusing way possible, and using INCREDIBLY inflammatory phrasing, because I knew people would have questions and I didn\u2019t want to answer them, and when I did post a bit about it, I didn\u2019t use language that sounds like I\u2019m off psychiatric medication. Frankly, it reads like any of the hundreds of unhinged conspiracy theories that people in cults like QAnon post every day, especially with the catchy slogans she chose to use. For someone who has spent decades in the legal system she sure doesn\u2019t know how to write in a way that inspires any level of confidence. Also, if you post online as a PSA, maybe have a friend read for clarity, and bother to respond (even privately) to details that you\u2019ve chosen to release that are confusing. Idk, maybe don\u2019t expect strangers who don\u2019t know anything about you to believe your wildly explosive claims, such as suspicious deaths and rape dungeons.\n\nPamela could have gone to the news, or chosen to write her post in a less batshit insane way. Sorry she didn\u2019t, and sorry you\u2019re offended enough by people not blindly believing everything outrageous and emotional they read on Facebook, maybe don\u2019t post on social media if you don\u2019t want to field questions from strangers",

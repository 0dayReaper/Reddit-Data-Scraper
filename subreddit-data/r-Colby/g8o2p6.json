    "postText": "Hi, I was accepted to Colby under the GES. The way I understand it is I\u2019d go to France for a semester and then spend the following four years at Colby. Is this mandatory? I bet they\u2019ll cancel it anyway due to the pandemic but personally, this is very unappealing. \n\nI emailed the school and am waiting to hear back but I wanted to post here to also get any feedback on the program and its pros/cons. I\u2019m still choosing between Colby and Boston College and this would definitely influence that decision. Thanks.",

            "comment": "There is a lot of uncertainty for both the regular and the GES semesters. The GES would also certainly depend on the partner school as well. At this point, the administration didn't make an announcement about what will happen. David Greene (the president of the College) did however made a statement to the NYT that implies they are considering pushing it back instead of doing it remotely.",

You have to do really well to get more and for my professor, he told us in the beginning it was rare to get 30/30. Either way, still should be fine as long as you try and do well in everything (projects hw quizzes exam). 3.9 is pretty much all As with occasional A-. It honestly just depends on how bad you want it and how much you social life you are willing to give up for it.",

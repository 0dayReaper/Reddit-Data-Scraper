    "postText": "Hi all, niche topic that might not have many responses but I was recently accepted to Colby with my first semester in Dijon France! Exciting, but I wanted to know if anyone else had experience studying abroad their first semester of college and what it was like (or perhaps anyone else that is in my situation right now, I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts as well!). I imagined myself going abroad more like junior year so first semester of freshman year is interesting, and I wonder how it would go",

I\u2019d have to make sure Colby is the place for me first because there\u2019s a chance with COVID that this might not even happen and I\u2019ll be in Maine. I am an intended french major so in theory this would be a great opportunity, but I just worry it might be at the expense of my overall college experience, missing out on the first semester and meeting new people or whatnot. Also, my French is pretty meh so I worry first semester freshman year wouldn\u2019t be the best time to go to France. However, France is France! Always wanted to go and it would definitely help my french being with a host family and whatnot. Certainly giving me a lot to think about! What about you, what are you thinking?",

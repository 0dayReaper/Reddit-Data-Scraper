Colby and UC Berkeley are my top choices at the moment because of the aid that I got. Would I be able to ask you some questions about your experience at Colby College? my instagram is goodsonnj so please reach out! I'm a prospective major for Econ or Comp Sci; or some amalgam of both whether its major/minor or major/major. Thanks!!",

    "postText": "How beneficial are the presidential/Bunche programs? I can only find a few paragraphs on their website describing them. It seems vague. How many scholars are there?\nThe Pulver science scholars and CAPS seem more involved/selective/ specific. If I am in a scholar program is it possible I can also be admitted to CAPS?\nPlease let me know your experience with any of these programs as I\u2019ve been admitted to the presidential scholars program.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I just got accepted RD for the Colby class of 2024. I am really attracted to the academic environment, but I've heard mixed things about the social atmosphere (that athletes stick together, and the student body is mostly upper class and white). Do people that don't fall into those categories feel like they have at least found a group of friends they can rely on? I'd love any comments about the overall culture at Colby as well.",

Most people can be connected with 2 or so degrees of connection, so it's easy to end up at parties and the such with people you wouldn't otherwise know. Most parties are hosted by sports teams but are open to whoever",

I have loads of friends who aren't athletes and none of them have ever voiced any concerns about having trouble fitting in. Keep in mind that Colby is about as D3 as it gets -- sports aren't taken extremely seriously. With regards to overall culture, kids love to shit on how Colby is very rich, white, WASPY etc. but everyone I've ever interacted with is super nice, friendly, and just there to learn and have fun",

I'm not saying only rich white people can fit in, far from it, but I would say the person above me is maybe slightly overstating things.",

I think groups of any type congregate together in the setting of Colby: a somewhat isolated, small school. It\u2019s intimate for sure. You\u2019re going to see the same people everyday. I loved it though. I had a lot of friends who were frisbee players but I didn\u2019t play and I had a lot of friends who were in the arts but I didn\u2019t do that either. Both through classroom experiences and socializing in the dorms or at parties, I made friends with lots of people who weren\u2019t from my \u201cworld\u201d and I was better for it. I think Colby\u2019s social sphere has some bad points too, there are plenty of entitled fratty white dudes and certainly drinking is a focal point of party college - so young dumb people make bad decisions. I made friends for life here and I\u2019m grateful I went to Colby. Let me know if you want any more information - and try not to let that one person who is active on this sub cast a portrait of doom and gloom :)",

However, I really do believe that you learn to find your people and your niche, be it through clubs, classes (language classes in my experience are really tight), dorms, community service etc. \n\nAs others have said, yes there are \"entitled\" people and it's majority white. However, it's definitely not just a Colby thing--you're going to find that at most private LACs in New England due to the history haha. Regardless, *there are just so many different types of students: artsy, activist, outdoorsy, athlete, introverted, extroverted...*You'll definitely find your people so don't let the stereotypes discourage you! Also, POC groups on campus are very vibrant and active. The QuestBridge chapter is one of the largest among LACs despite having formed just five years ago, and the school is diversifying with each incoming class. Also, due to the small community size, you really do find people who are genuine, down to earth, humble and you form deep bonds with the people here. Not to mention the professors are extremely supportive and invested in your education (something that may be harder to find at larger schools like BU so keep that in mind). As you can tell, I've really loved my time here haha.\n\nP.S. I'm also a Bunche Scholar and I'd say it actually isn't that much of a bonding \"cohort,\" but rather a funding resource/title, but the program is undergoing changes in its structure to perhaps address that. It's just that it's not a coherent group like QuestBridge for example that has regular meetings.\n\nPM me if you have any further questions! :)",

There are always going to be the privileged assholes\u2014especially considering the options you\u2019re weighing\u2014but the Colby community has plenty of healthy and wholesome social circles.\n\nIn regards to where most people make their friends outside of athletics, I met my non-athlete friends in class, at orientation, in academic clubs, or out partying. A couple people I even met just in the hall of my dorm. Your social network will be a point of nervousness regardless of where you choose to call home, but, like I said earlier, Colby is, in my opinion, very good at creating an environment to foster close connection.",

The campus is all along Comm Ave.  It's cool because of the hustle and bustle of everything, but you lose the tranquility of being on Mayflower Hill.  Do you want to be surrounded by nature or cars &amp; concrete?  (I'm not certain how you'd know that until you'd already lived in both.)\n* I got lots of attention from professors at Colby because there aren't graduate students for them to pay attention to.  I got lots of attention at BU because I was a grad student.  Worked out best for me both times.  I was on a first-name basis with most of my Colby professors and that was a great environment to study in.\n* There's going to be more diversity at BU.  Boston (as a city) still weirdly self-segregates, though.  Things could have changed a lot in the past decade, though!",

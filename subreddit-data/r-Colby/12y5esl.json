(After you were admitted to Colby). I am considering studying at Colby as well for a dual major in CS and Physics and then applying for Engineering dual major. Also watch out for an email from admissions, I heard that some people were admitted recently from the waitlist. Good luck!!!",

You will need to apply to the engineering program separately through a Dartmouth application your sophomore year. As Colby does not have an engineering degree, you will be majoring in something else during your time at Colby. Source: am a senior dual degree engineering student at colby",

As someone else said here, I think you can request chem-free or \"quiet\" dorms ... but you're still getting a random roommate, you'll just be grouped in the same building with folks who request the same thing. \n\nI think part of it is that they want to put first-year students a little bit out of their comfort zone and put you in a situation where you'll need to meet and get along with at least one fellow classmate ... and I think there is merit to that. \n\nI should add that I graduated a couple of years ago, but I can't imagine much has changed in that regard.",

You're either going to be placed in a double or a triple, and you likely won't be able to change your situation once that happens. You do have options with respect to requesting a \"quiet\" dorm or a \"substance-free\" dorm. You can also make special requests with regard to your room; I know someone who requested a southern facing dorm due to some sleep issues. Those requests are typically restricted to small concerns like that however.",

Part of that is due to the absolute lack of rooms we have (more students = more money but they don\u2019t wanna build the dorms for them lol), but also they just seem to really enjoy forcing people to live in the same room with strangers.",

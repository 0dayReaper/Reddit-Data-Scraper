    "postText": "Hey everybody, high-school senior here. I'm applying to Colby, but want to learn more about the place from students and alumni. So I was just wondering if you could answer a few of my questions:  \n  \n* What was the best academic experience you've had? Was there a brilliant professor who made a subject electrifying? Or a collaborative project that you're really proud of?  \n  \n* Science students: What sort of research have you been involved in?  \n  \n* Do you feel like Colby has made you a better learner?  \n  \n* Do you get along well with your peers?  \n  \nThanks!",

He liked my help so much, he let me come up with some problems for his book. Close second: being challenged over and over.  I wouldn't have been excited hearing about that in high school, but it turns out that there are really interesting things out there. \n\n* Science research: I did some cool programming language modelling for a concurrent/parallel computing environment. \n\n* Better learner?  Yes.\n\n* I got along really well with other students, though the same was true for me in high school.  There are a lot of different types of people at Colby; you will find people you get along with. \n\nGood luck in your college search! ",

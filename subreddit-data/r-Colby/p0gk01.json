    "postText": "I just graduated from Colby and will return to Colby as a full-time staff in late September-October so I am currently looking for housing in Waterville area. I was looking for studios and one-bedrooms but I just knew that Colby is allowing juniors and seniors to live off campus. I was wondering if anyone has recommendation for leasing agents and/or is interested in living off-campus.",

I'm leaning towards Colby at the moment but I was wondering how consistent they are with their financial aid? It's really generous this year for me but I want to be sure it'll stay that way and not kinda strip me of a chunk all of a sudden and I'll be in financial trouble. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. If there's any comp sci majors seeing this, how's the program over there? :)",

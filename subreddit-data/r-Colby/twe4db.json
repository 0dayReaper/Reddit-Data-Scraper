Of the cs majors I knew well, a lot went to impressive jobs at Microsoft, Epic Systems, Facebook, etc. I admittedly don\u2019t know as many who went to grad school, but one or two I can think of went to pretty well-regarded programs. The major itself has grown a lot in the past few years and the schools putting a lot of resources into it",

Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. are desperate for software engineers and they will hire you if you have an internship or two and if you can do leetcode. And once you get your first job, nobody cares where you went to school. \n\nIf you want to go to grad school, you may want to see if you'd like to do research with any of the professors at Colby. If the topics they research don't interest you, then it will be more of a grind to have an attractive grad school resume.",

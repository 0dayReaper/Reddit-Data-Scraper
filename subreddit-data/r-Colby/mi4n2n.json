    "postText": "Hi all! I\u2019m a recent admit who is heavily leaning towards Colby, but I wanted to ask some questions first. How is campus life, and what do you guys do for fun at Colby? How is Waterville? Also, particularly for me, how are the outdoor opportunities around Colby? I love running and hiking and would be thrilled if there were good trails &amp; outdoor clubs. Anything related to fun and campus life I would love to hear your takes on it!",

Would recommend having a car on campus ( i should mention though that I was one of the last classes to have free parking on campus so I dont know if the price is worth it). That being said my gf is on campus and have a good time. She cant drive but still manages to get off campus a bunch to go hiking and shopping etc. Hope this helps!",

            "comment": "Campus life is alright. It\u2019s not a huge party school but it\u2019s social enough if you have a good friend group. My biggest problem with campus life is that the experience is very housing dependent. I had great years when teammates had an apartment to host parties and a terrible year when none did. Although this has changed a lot with the downtown apartments providing more social space. Waterville isn\u2019t great but it\u2019s decently sized and as such has most services you\u2019d need and some good dining options. It\u2019s hard to beat Colby for outdoor activities. Skiing is a huge part of campus culture (sugarloaf is the best resort east of Colorado if I do say so myself) and there\u2019s the best hiking on the east coast within close proximity in the Presidential range/Mahoosucs/High peak region/Acadia/Katahdin (although Katahdin is much further than the others). If you like trail running there\u2019s great trails in the arboretum and just off campus at quarry road.",

It\u2019s a ridiculously easy drive to Portland. I wouldn\u2019t say people in general go a lot, though. Most of the time you\u2019re too busy to drive an hour just to get a meal or whatever. The most common outings are to Augusta to get Chipotle/Panera or Freeport to go shopping. People definitely go to Acadia a lot in the early fall when the weather is nice.",

Waterville is more \u201ctiny city\u201d than \u201crural town\u201d and it\u2019s a little bit of a \u201cmetro area\u201d with Augusta/Skowhegan and surrounding towns. The economy is more industrial than agricultural owing to the mills built up on the Kennebec river.",

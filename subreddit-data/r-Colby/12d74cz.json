Not sure about other majors, though.\n\nSocial life is ok. There are certainly some interesting events hosted by the SGA and SPB here and there, and some parties on Fridays and Saturdays, but that\u2019s about it. If you don\u2019t find yourself a friend group starting from the first month of school, you might probably feel a bit left out. But that depends on the person, ofc.\n\nBut take my comment with a grain of salt. DYOR, text Atakan (above), watch some Youtube videos (sadly, there are not many). If you have a chance to come to the Admitted Student Day, you can come and get a feel of Colby yourself.\n\nAlso, dm me if you have any questions.\nAll the best :)",

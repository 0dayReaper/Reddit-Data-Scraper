    "postText": "I was a math and computer science major who graduated in 2003.  I'm going to be giving a talk for the computer science department at 3:45.  I'll be talking about an abstract \"board\" game called Neighboring Nim.  Most of the talk will be accessible to anyone who likes playing games; the rules for the game are very simple.  I will challenge the audience to a game, so you'll have a chance to beat me! :)\n\nThe talk is in Roberts (do people still call it Bobs?) room 221.",

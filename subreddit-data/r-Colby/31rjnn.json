We've been considering our other alma maters ([Berkeley](http://alumni.berkeley.edu/membership/benefits/bankamericard-cash-rewards\u2122-visa\u00ae-credit-card), [Yale](https://www.firstbankcard.com/yale/103683/), [University of Washington](https://www.applyonlinenow.com/USCCapp/Ctl/entry?sc=VAB86Z&amp;mboxSession=1413392011226-766223)), which both have some sort of credit card program that somehow contributes to their coffers, but would rather use this opportunity to donate to Colby.

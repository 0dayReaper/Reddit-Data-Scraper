A lot of the student population are recruited athletes which means they don't need to be insanely smart to get in, but on the other hand, there are really smart and high achieving people here. Regardless, I think probably around 80-90% of the student body is hard working and high achieving.",

Obv a big generalization but this is what I noticed in my time at Colby",

There are really smart people who belong elsewhere and there are really stupid bastards. Also as someone else explained, Colby\u2019s acceptance rate is extremely misleading. It used to be around 20% like 10 years ago. Makes it look a lot more prestigious than it actually is",

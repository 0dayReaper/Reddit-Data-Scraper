    "postText": "Hi ya'll. Hope you can help me out \n\nI just graduated high school a couple of months ago in June 2021. So in my senior year, I applied to a bunch of colleges and got waitlisted at Colby. I never got off the waitlist but I did commit to another college, with plans of attending obviously. Due to some financial barriers last minute I had to defer until next year. Meanwhile, my university allows me to take 2 classes per semester at another institution. Starting January 4th I'm starting to take classes at community college and will be taking classes Winter, Spring, and Summer semesters of 2022. \n\nI emailed the admissions counselor for my region and asked whether I should apply as a first-year or a transfer student. She said I should apply as a transfer student. But I know the acceptance rate for transfer students is really low. Is it lower than just applying as a first-year? Can I technically apply as a first-year and just transfer my credits later?\n\nbasically: Is it possible to apply as a first-year, and will it increase my chances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, since I got waitlisted last year, will that give me a higher chance of getting accepted?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance :)",

            "comment": "Since you haven't gotten an answer yet, I'll throw in my thoughts. My thoughts are: you already have your answer. You messaged the admissions counselor and she replied with what you should do. You should absolutely listen to her advice and reasoning; she is an employee of the school with extensive experience with exactly your situation. \n\nAs to the rest of your post and your other questions. I'm sure you're aware that being accepted off the wait list is long odds. You are also aware that being accepted as a transfer student is extremely long odds (as far as I know, the number of students accepted this way at Colby each year is in the low single digits). As for being waitlisted, I would imagine that would lower (not actively) your chances in the sense that Colby has already told you they are not interested. As for your question about applying as a first-year, it may *technically* be possible for you to apply as a first year, but most colleges define a transfer as someone who as started any college courses, regardless of whether they completed them or not. If you take courses winter, spring, and fall, you will be a transfer student technically. If you then apply as a student who just happened to take a year off, you would probably be committing at best academic dishonesty. Additionally, you have already apprised your counselor of your situation, further complicating things. \n\nTo summarize: if you apply as a transfer, you are applying to a program with an exceptionally low acceptance rate to a school which already denied you admission. If you apply as a first year, you are being at best dishonest, have already told your counselor the situation, must explain an entire year of blank space in your life, and are applying to a school which already denied you admission. If you are set on applying to Colby, I strongly recommend heading the advice of your counselor, and reaching out to discuss the matter more with them to see if there are any ways you can improve your chances. Alternatively, your time may be better spent working on solving your financial barriers and attending the other college, which I'm sure will provide everything you need it to if you devote yourself to being an exceptional student at that university.",

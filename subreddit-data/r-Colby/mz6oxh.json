So if there are any current Colby students or even wise prospective students who can talk to me about Colby I\u2019d be very grateful. \n\nI\u2019ve consumed all online info about the school and went to a bunch of webinars but I still can\u2019t decide. \n\nP. S. Im thinking the premed route so if u have any inside info on that track,  that\u2019d be a bonus, but i also just would appreciate any help.",

Also if u had any insight on realistically how common/easy it is to get into research that\u2019d be great:)",

It's quite common and not hypercompetitive, though this may vary depending on your interest or if your desire rests with a popular professor.\n\nPertaining to accessibility to Waterville, if your aim is to frequent the primary points of interests (main shops and retail) either downtown or in the nearby shopping outlet - the shuttle is fairly reliable. However, Colby is very much car dependent (so know someone with a car essentially or have one) if you want to travel beyond in the region. Greyhound offers services for longer-distance traveling not affiliated with the College, but it has only one bus stop that runs at sometimes irregular hours.\n\nTo your point about feeling on campus, it depends on the season you're on campus. But, there's many activities to do on campus - in non-COVID times - I'm sure it was much more prevalent.",

Downtown there's a few shops/restaurants, but not much else. Also, on weekends there is a shuttle going to a nearby Walmart, very useful if you don't have a car. There's actually two more options for moving around, but I haven't really used them much: the Jitney, an awesome but unreliable student-driven free taxi, or zipcar, which is a company that lets you rent cars for hours/days for reasonable prices. There's 1-2 on campus and I know of people that have used them successfully. But otherwise as others have said it's easier to make friends with someone with a car... there's a lot of them.\n\n2. I don't really feel bored or trapped, but admittedly I'm a bit of an introvert, so I'm most happy in my relatively small friend group. That being said, there's plenty to do for everyone, from parties large or small (post-covid at least) to plenty of activities on weekends and otherwise. Stuff like paint night, karaoke, contradance, casino night, outside movie night... really anything that you can think of does sometime happen on campus. \n\n3. Research is rather easy to get into, especially if you're doing a good job in the classes you're taking in the relevant department. Usually it's all about walking to a professor and asking if they need help with research... often they will have spots available and will be happy to hire, if you have the prerequisite knowledge or can be trained. There's also research opportunities over the summer, and these are also easy to get. For student-led research you can simply find a professor as supervisor and then sign up for an Independent Study. It's not paid but counts as semester credit.\n\nEdit: I don't know about the pre-med track, but you will get an advisor (who is a professor on campus) assigned and they will be able to point you in the right direction. I have a friend or two that are doing premed, AFAIK it's just a number of required courses. It can be easy or hard depending on your major... a friend of mine is majoring in Physics and doing pre-med and there's little overlap and hard courses on both sides. But once again you'll have plenty of opportunities to talk about this with your advisor. Btw after you declare a major at end of freshman year you get a different advisor for that specific major. Not sure about pre-med, but there probably is some professor that takes that role.",

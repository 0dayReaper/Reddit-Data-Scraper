    "postText": "Hi, I'm going to attend Colby this fall as a Freshman and I have some questions regarding my hobby. I currently have 2 radio-controlled planes, a small aerobatic foam plane and a speed plane that can achieve up to 200km/h; both have 32 inches wingspans. \n\nMy aerobatic plane can't handle strong wind, so I need to fly it indoors. Can I fly it inside Harold Alfond Athletics and Recreation Center when there isn't anyone around? If not, are there any other places for me to play with it?\n\nThe other plane is really fast and dangerous, so I was wondering if there are any rc groups or rc flying fields nearby Colby for me to join? \n\nThanks,",

There's a decent chance you can just show up when no one's around and that no one will bother you.\n\nAnother possibility would be to start a RC club at Colby. If you do that (especially if you register it as a sports club) then booking spaces should be quite easy. I can tell you that I'd gladly join, for one!",

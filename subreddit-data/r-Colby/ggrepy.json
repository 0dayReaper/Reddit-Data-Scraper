Some friends have been telling me that Econ is one of the harder majors at Colby... any truth to it? Not very bright so it Lowkey scares me that the major I wanna pursue can be that difficult",

            "comment": "I think that the difficulty of a major is relative. Yes, the Econ major at Colby has some math-heavy classes that require a lot of work and are challenging subjects. Yes, I do think that the math and science curriculum at Colby is harder from a work standpoint than say a humanities major. I don\u2019t think you should be afraid of it though. Every class will challenge you in some way. You\u2019ll be better through your process of growth. Remember, this is a space that should facilitate social and emotional growth as well (something that I think was more important for me than a class or a test during my 4 years on the hill.)",

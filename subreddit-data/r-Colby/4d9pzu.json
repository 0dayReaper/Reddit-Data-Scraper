            "comment": "For your questions; the towns not far, but you won't be going without a car and you likely won't want to. Waterville is ok for the small stuff; there's a few cafe's, the odd good small restaurant (grand central), some fun bars, but people aren't making it their business to go to town every friday and saturday. You hang out, party, and have fun in the dorms. I liked that a lot. Weather sucks. A lot. It's not as bad as some places I've lived (new hampshire), but the winter is long and you'll have snow on the ground until april. It makes you appreciate the nice weather that much more though. \n\nThe dorms are all good, fairly standard, everything you would expect. Obviously I don't know you, so I can't say whether you should be in chem-free, but I would say no as the dorms are such a huge part of your social life and they only get roudy in very specific places. It really depends on luck though so you could get placed in a roudy dorm and that might suck for you. The parties keep to the rooms though, so just so long as you didn't live literally next to a party room you'd never even notice it. CA's do a pretty good job of keeping things under control. My only reason not to pick chem-free is because those are the people who you'll likely become friends with and they can be very quiet and less than outgoing, but if that's no problem go ahead. \n\nSome good and bad? Honestly, it's hard for me to come up with bad. I've been gone from Colby for a few years, so I definitely look at it with rose tinted glasses, but they were some of the best years of my life. More relevant, I've been to two other schools in that time; a preppy ivy and a massive state school, and in almost every possible way Colby is better. The teachers are generally outstanding and are actually there to teach, not research (which is almost all you should really care about, your parents after all are (likely) paying for you to get an education) and the community is tight, generally friendly, welcoming, and (somewhat) diverse as well. I guess if I had problems, it was the inherent problems that come with being a small school; a disasterous career office, a somewhat bumbling admin (they all are; the admin of my current school is under investigation and is being sued, it's all relative), and an inability to escape contact with people I really didn't want to talk to. I'm sure if you chose Colby you'd probably be very happy, but something I try to say to everyone who's choosing a school: in general, you will likely be happy wherever you go. Simply going to college is just so amazing (though it may seem scary now); responsibility, freedom, new friends, cool classes. The most important thing is going in with a good attitude; if you really want to be somewhere, pick that place, because your attitude is going to make or break college, deciding how well you make friends and how much you devote to your classes. Take it from me though, as someone who has been in college for a long (looooooooooong) time, Colby is miles above a lot of schools. It just felt like home. If you havn't, I highly recommend visiting, going to a class or two, and doing a sleepover, it can give a really good sense of the kind of people, teachers, and community Colby is and would really help you make up your mind. \n\nHope I answered some questions, I know it wasn't really basic information, but college is a really important decision (not trying to scare you) and you should have as much information as you can get. There are other threads on this subreddit asking pretty much your exact question, I encourage you to look at them for some other opinions. ",

As someone said above, hillside can be pretty shitty since they\u2019re in an awful location (far away from everything on campus) and it\u2019s a pretty busy party dorm so you won\u2019t get a ton of quiet. Everyone is also kinda crammed in there lol.   Since freshman year ur roommate is random too u can either get someone u end up hating or someone that ends up being a friend for life lmao. Finally there\u2019s sadly a \u201chousing crisis\u201d on campus so as a freshman it\u2019s very likely you\u2019ll get a forced triple dorm. Pm me if u have any other questions, I\u2019d love to help. I wish I had known more before coming in my freshman year lmao",

    "postText": "Im gonna be a first year next year at Colby and am in the midst of AP week. The Colby website says that scoring a 4 or higher on the AP stats exam satisfies your quantitative requirement for graduation. I got a 5 on AP Calc last year which also fulfills the requirement. If I take Stats and get a 4 or 5 will it actually do anything? The AP test is in 2 days, so I\u2019m trying to figure out if it\u2019s worth it to study for",

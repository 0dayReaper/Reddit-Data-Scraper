    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m going to be a freshman at Colby this fall. I have completed AP Micro and Macro during high school. Is it possible for me to be employed as a research assistant? Do you recommend participation in research activities in the first semester? If yes, who should I contact to get further information?\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "Definitely possible to start research your first year, but all the first years I knew who did research first semester were Presidential Scholars. In order to get research your second semester, establish a relationship with your professors (drop into office hours, ask questions in class, etc.) and then ask what their current research is on and if they'd like help. Sometimes professors say no initially, but offering help *for free* can sway them. To be sure, you may need the money from the job, but if you don't...\n\nEdit: Big thing is to get to school first and establish relationships with your professors",

You may not get your name on the paper but you will develop a relationship with a professor, gain experience to help you land future research more easily, and be able to choose more accurately if you truly enjoy your field of study. Also, research may continue into the summer and doing research on campus during the summer before your sophomore year is really really good.\n\nPS\u2014 not sure you can study abroad as a sophomore. You\u2019ll have to double check that.",

It was a worthwhile experience, and I would highly recommend it. As far as getting a research position goes, I would echo what KitchenTable said above. It also doesn\u2019t hurt to reach out to department heads and ask if they know of any openings (my girlfriend landed a research job this way). If you have any questions, feel welcome to pm!\nP.S. I\u2019m 99% sure that Colby only lets juniors and seniors study abroad.",

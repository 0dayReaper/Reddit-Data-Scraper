    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a current high school senior thinking about applying ED to Colby. However, COVID is making it hard for me to make a decision about my ED school considering I never got the opportunity to really get a feel for most of them. I was wondering if anyone would be willing to talk about life at Colby with me- social scene, how isolated it is, if it\u2019s cliquey, etc. Thanks in advance!",

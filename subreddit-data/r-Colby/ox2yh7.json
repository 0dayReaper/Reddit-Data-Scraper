    "postText": "Basically the title.\n\nI'm a international freshman of the class of 2025. I got placed in the East Quad - Triples with a double room.\n\nThe building seems to be in the optimal distance from most other things on campus (from what I saw on the floor plans). And the double room seems to make more sense than a one room triple (I could be wrong though).\n\nI would love to hear anyone's advice of must-haves I should bring when I arrive on campus as well as how different it is living in the east quads compared to other dorms.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t know if I have a ton to say on East. It\u2019s one of the largest dorms, and the rooms are generally nicely sized to my knowledge. I also think they recently redid the bathrooms? It is pretty central on campus, and it\u2019s right next to Johnson Pond, which is very pretty. The triples are generally at the ends of the building, and it\u2019s probably good to chat with your roommates about which room of the two each of you will be in before you get to campus.\n\nAs far as must haves\u2026 \n- extension cords/power strips: there aren\u2019t always a ton of outlets, at least to the point where you may need to reach to get access to your bed or desk. Power strips will make that much easier\n- lighting. Generally the rooms are nice, some get more light than others, but the ceiling lights can sometimes make things feel pretty dim. Having a lamp (either standing or a small desktop lamp) is helpful, but it also just makes the rooms feel nicer.\n- decorations: the rooms feel so much better when there are things on the walls. There will be a big poster sale a few weeks in, but even just a few things to start is awesome\n- reusable water bottle (or 2): at the very least you\u2019ll need it for COOT, but there are filling stations everywhere so they\u2019re good to bring to class\n- fan: it is maine, it will get cold, but when you get there it will be warm and humid. The dorms don\u2019t have ac. Put a fan in your window, though, and you\u2019ll be fine\n\nI\u2019m blanking on other stuff rn but I\u2019ll try to brainstorm a bit. Also lmk if you have any other questions!",

Also, what's ur take on the laundry view service they provide? Any experience with it?\n\nThanks for the taking the time out to write the detailed answer btw",

Are you referring to the service where a company (I forget the name) would pick you your dirty laundry at your door, clean it, then return it? I personally never used it, I would say most don\u2019t but it wasn\u2019t super uncommon.\n\nPersonally I thought it was easy enough to do laundry on my own. The laundry rooms all have instructions but you basically load your laundry into the washer, throw in a pod/detergent, select the machine number on a little keypad, then swipe your Colby card (which will subtract somewhere around 1.70 from your account). If you do that you\u2019d just want to set an alarm on you phone, then hang out in your room for a little while til it was time to move it to the dryer. Wash takes 35-45 min and the dryer takes about 1 hour. You\u2019ll sort of figure out a schedule for when the laundry room gets busy and when it\u2019s pretty empty.\n\nAnd yeah, every dorm has a laundry room. If they say most, it\u2019s possible that dorms like Coburn and Mary Low, which are connected, share one, but everyone will certainly have laundry in the building they live in",

The location is great.\n\n20 years ago it was very exciting to have a bay window triple on the end of the building.  Back then those rooms weren't really given to first year students, though.",

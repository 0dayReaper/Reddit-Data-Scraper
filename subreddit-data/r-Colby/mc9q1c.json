    "postText": "I was recently admitted to GES and was pretty excited. While it wasn't ideal, Colby is one of my top choices and I was excited to receive some form of acceptance. However, my parents, who are paying for my college, don't feel great about the prospect of having their kid thousands of miles away during a pandemic for his first semester of college. While they will let me go if I'm set on it, I want to value their feelings, as, again, they're fronting the $300k bill. Is there any way I can get out of GES and go straight to campus? If I contact admissions, do you think they'll be sympathetic?",

            "comment": "I would strongly recommend reaching out to admissions. Covid however is such a difficult situation for everyone involved that I would not even begin to guess about what the situation is that Colby is dealing with or how able they are to be accommodating. However, there is no way reaching out and getting the not preferred answer would end up hurting you in anyway, so there is no reason not to do it if you want to. \n\nI would also urge you to rethink your attitude towards accepting/not-accepting the year abroad with respect to your parents wishes. I very much appreciate the extreme generosity your parents are showing by paying your tuition, and appreciate how you want to show responsibility and respect towards that unimaginably large gift. I am not saying you should definitely go, but I will say that what you get out of college is based more than anything on what you put in and what you put in is based on your enthusiasm and dedication. What your parents truly want you to do is to get the most out of college that you can in the form of personal growth, social experiences, education, etc. If a semester abroad is extremely relevant to your interests, if you are extremely enthusiastic about it, and if it will greatly enhance the quality of what Colby can provide you, then respectfully explaining that to your parents and then doing it is the best way you can honor their gift. With respect to the risks presented by Covid; I am virtually certain you will be vaccinated before traveling. \n\nIn addition to reaching out to admissions, reaching out to your dean (I assume you have been assigned one) is probably also worth your time. I would not assume Colby is going to slide easily on this if it does go forward; during normal times as far as I am aware it has been \"Semester abroad or nothing\". Deferring your first semester or two may also be an option if you can prove to Colby that you would be pursuing valuable interests during that time, but that is an aggressive option that your parents would likely also need to fund. It can be very worthwhile for both your personal growth and giving you time to become even more motivated about college post-high school however. I would also not assume as the other commenter said that Colby has the room; they are possibly struggling very hard with student housing currently. The vast majority of juniors spend time abroad, which normally frees up space. I am sure many of them are canceling their plans, and even during a normal year Colby student housing is full to the brim. It is very likely that Colby will be using semi-permanent off campus housing, possibly even hotel rooms, to supplement and is more or less completely unable to accommodate additional freshman housing requests.",

I would hope they would respect us not wanting to travel abroad and live in a locked-down country during a pandemic-- especially with how much it costs.",

No GES plus no abroad for juniors has made the kids who would\u2019ve been in GES essentially sleep in sleeping bags.\n\nThink about it this way: if you absolutely fucking despise brocoli but you must eat it to stay alive, you\u2019ll find a way to make it work. That\u2019s what Colby did.\n\nBtw... GES is absolutely incredible. The friends you make there are closer than any you could make here.",

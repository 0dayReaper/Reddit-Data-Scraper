            "comment": "Welcome to COLBY! I graduated in '22 so I am happy to help. \n\nEssential Dorm items: \n\nMicrowave, mini fridge, bedding for xL twin size bed, shower caddy, things that remind you of home (posters, pictures, etc, extra storage bins), lamp \n\nTips:\n\n* You can request a higher bed so you have more storage space below your bed\n* Go to many social events by clubs or organizations you become a part of\n* Get a good solid winter coat and boots, it gets real slippery in the winter time (BLACK ice!)\n* Keep a good attitude. There are going to be days you are frustrated with classes, admin, food, and classmates. But keeping a good overall attitude and surrounding yourself with good people helps a lot. \n* ENJOY COOT\n* Don't overload your freshman courses. Find courses you want to try out and take freshman year as an opportunity to learn and discover yourself. \n* Be careful around parties. Definitely have fun but if you feel uncomfortable in any situation be strong and know your values. I know lots of people who regret things they did in freshman year. \n* Winter time is long and depressing at times. Classes are harder second semester so things seem really tough. But participate in different activities provided by the college helps a lot\n* Go to davis connects often for class scheduling, career searching, internships, writing applications, resumes, cover letters, etc. Take advantage of their money ;)",

            "comment": "College is definitely what you make of it, but in my opinion it is ESPECIALLY true at Colby as there isn\u2019t much to do in the surrounding area. You will likely be miserable if you wait for opportunities to fall at your feet, because they won\u2019t. You need to be proactive \u2014 go to clubs and on campus events  and take risks!!!! Get off campus!! Have a really open mind about things. Diversify your friends, I.e.: don\u2019t just stick with the first group of friends you meet at Colby. You can make Colby a great place for you where you can grow a lot, but it won\u2019t just happen naturally.\n\nAlso, I figured I should add the dining hall food is a lot better than it used to be! People shit on it all the time (it really sucked back in fall semester 2021 and that janplan). Try new things and diversify your plates and you really can feel it make a difference everyday.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of more that can be said that can be answered by watching a YouTube video on general college necessities so I won\u2019t bother with that.",

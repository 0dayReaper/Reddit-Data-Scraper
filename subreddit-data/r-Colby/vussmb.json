    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm here because I am thinking about applying to Colby for this upcoming admission cycle. I currently have 20 colleges on my list and am trying to narrow it down to around 10-12. I have limited knowledge of Colby and would like to hear from current students about their time there. If possible, could some people give me an honest pro and con list on the different aspects of the college? You can discuss anything \u2014 weather, academics, social life, athletics, or dining. I am planning on registering for information sessions but would like the information not given at info sessions. Thank you so much for your help!",

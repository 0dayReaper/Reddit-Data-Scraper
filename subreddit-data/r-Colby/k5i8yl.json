    "postText": "Coming in as a student I didn't realize how amazing DavisConnects is or how tight knit the alum network is. Like the funnel into finance at top investment banks is amazing (we've already had Colby-specific Citi and Bank of America sessions this semester). Want to get funded to travel abroad in January or get an internship in D.C.? All easily done through DavisConnects. So many recent grads who also got jobs through Colby connections during this crazy economy. It's just insane how great the network is and outsiders don't seem to know about it. It's like a hidden gem.",

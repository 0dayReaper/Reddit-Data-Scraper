    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI got a full-ride scholarship from Colby and will be attending next year! However, I have some questions in mind.\n\n* I have a very specific focus on computer science: I want to take advanced courses on complexity theory and algorithmic game theory. Will it be possible at a small liberal arts college like Colby? I looked at the courses offered and there are around 10-15 courses offered per semester, and most of them are not particularly interesting for me.\n* I have already studied many topics and got an olympiad medal. Will the department let me get credit for the courses I already know the material of? Or, at the very least, would they let me take higher-level courses without giving me credit for the introductory courses?\n* How rigorous and time-consuming are math and computer science courses? How collaborative are people? Is there grade inflation or deflation?\n* I want to do serious research, and hopefully publish papers before I graduate. How willing are professors to work with students and do meaningful research with them?\n* How good are graduate school placements for math and computer science students?\n* Lastly a general question: How is the general vibe? How do people socialize and have fun? What should I expect as a Turkish student from a low-income family?\n\nI know there are many questions here, and thanks for reading until here. Any help is immensely appreciated!",

That being said, I think the dept pulls most of its weight for what it is. I\u2019d definitely couple the major with math though if you want a more rigorous course load.",

            "comment": "I was a Math/CS major who went on to get their PhD in CS.  I got into PhD programs at Boston University and U of Michigan and Tufts (though they make you start out as a masters student).  I didn't publish anything until my last semester in an undergrad journal, so if you have success before then, you should be good.\n\nThe department will be good about helping you get in to the appropriate courses.\n\nI would recommend majoring in Math or Mathematical Sciences (if they still have that one).  In the CS major, take both Algorithms and Theory of Computation.  (Comp Theory might still count for both Math and CS.)\n\nIf you talk to professors about doing research projects, they will generally want to take you on, especially if you do well in courses and have a good attitude. \n\nThe classes are quite collaborative.  Lab time is generally pretty social and is a good time to help other people and get help yourself.\n\nSome of the language/culture clubs run regular events.  The German Club used to run a weekly coffee hour and many international students came who weren't in any German courses.  Unless you bring your own double-boiler, you might not get to have any Turkiye Cay, but there used to be tea and hot chocolate there.\n\nHave a great time!",

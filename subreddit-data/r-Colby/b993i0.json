To my knowledge, no similar schools have active subreddits either. I wish you good luck in this endeavor though, would be awesome if it worked.",

Mentioned them, maybe they could chime in and help you :) Congratulations on your acceptances, and good luck on your decisions. Hope to see you @ Colby :)",

Also, getting an e-mail about CARA research projects is almost a likely letter because it relates to being a presidential scholar.\n\nstats: 1550 SAT, 800 on Math 2 Physics Subject Tests. International student applying for aid. 7.5 IELTS. Indicated CS as my major in my application. \n\nessay: how I taught myself multiple programming languages and my passion for coding &amp; entrepreneurship. 8/10\n\nrecommendations: one from AP bio &amp; project mentor, one from humanities. didn't read either but first one probably better because he mentored me for a science fair project that won multiple national awards. \n\nECs: multiple national science fair awards; four years of teaching myself code, passed the first round of national informatics olympiad, built multiple websites with some traction, worked (paid) as a software developer in the summer at an established company, worked as a software developer freelancer.\n\ninterview: my English was terrible because I was anxious but it helped me express my passion for creating and intellectual interests.",

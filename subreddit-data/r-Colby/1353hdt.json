But thats like any public communal bathroom. Not many privste bathrooms but they exist. Most showers have curtains at the very least so theres that. \n\nThere\u2019s probably going to be a lot of forced triples and maybe quads since they overenrolled like motherfuckers.",

If you're looking for luxury you won't find it but if you're looking for a place where you can satisfy your needs comfortably Colby offers that for the most part imo. Also I don't think there will be a lot of forced/adapted spaces next year. Because they enrolled less than last year and they built two new dorms this year.",

            "comment": "The bathrooms are fine themselves. Bathrooms have curtains, certain ones have a little area outside you can get changed in. Certain suites and all apartments get private bathrooms, and if you have accommodations you can get a room with a bathroom. Communal bathrooms sucks, and I have seen other colleges do them better, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that Colby in particular does terrible.\n\nI will say that people at this school have absolutely no sense of hygiene or germ theory or don\u2019t keep in mind that it is a shared bathroom. People piss and shit without washing their hands routinely. It\u2019s probably not a Colby specific thing, but it\u2019s just something to keep in mind. I use my elbows or a paper towel to touch anything. I caught a terrible stomach virus in the spring semester and honest to god I get sick several times every semester from someone hacking up a lung in the bathroom. Again, college life, not something Colby does in particular I\u2019m sure.",

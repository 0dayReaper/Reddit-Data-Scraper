If so, double high five, man.  If not, still double high five for making the trek 3000 miles across the country!\n\nI'd like to echo the paithanq's comment about enjoying the ME winter.  I miss falling on my ass walking on ice, trudging through 4 feet of snow, and generally being frozen to the bone.  Get out and do some local tourism.  That's one thing I regret not doing much in my four years there.  \n\nI just came across this subreddit a while back, and subscribed just for the heck of it.  Oh, my name is Mike.     ",

Here's the recipe someone passed on to me.  It worked 10 years ago, hopefully it would still work now.\n\nPlan: drive to Jackman, ME.  It's about a 2-hour drive along the Kennebec River; very beautiful.  Plan to arrive up there a bit before dusk.  Eat dinner there, then drive back towards Colby.  With any luck, you'll see a moose.  We saw exactly one moose, so I guess it worked.  The canadian border isn't far off, so bring your passports if you want to cross over.\n\nThe biggest problem for me was that all my passengers fell asleep while I was driving back, and I was really nervous about not seeing a moose on the road in the dark and hitting it.  Definitely stay awake and alert on the trip back!\n\nYet another fun trip is to go to Acadia National Park.  There is nearly no one there between now and the spring.  In December 2008 I spent a bunch of nights up there.  $50 hotel rooms per night and complete run of Bar Harbor made for a great trip.  Be sure to drive through Somes Sound (one of the few Fjords in the US).  The driving can be very treacherous in the snow.\n\nSorry that these both require a car!",

            "comment": "Dorms are generally around 100sqft per person (200 for a double) though they can vary a lot building to building. Some are smaller some are larger. Overall nothing too fancy but they work fine. Some of the smaller ones can feel kinda cramped, and you won\u2019t really have room for much in the way of furniture but I think that\u2019s pretty par for the course for freshmen dorms at colleges. There are some nice suites and college-owned apartments that are available to juniors and seniors so housing does evolve with your time there",

            "comment": "Social life: can change a lot person to person, but I\u2019d say one constant is that because Colby\u2019s kinda far from major cities and Waterville doesn\u2019t exactly have a night life, there tends to be a lot going on on campus. People will host parties out of their dorm rooms, usually the on campus senior apartments have a bunch going on on weekend nights, the school tends to host a fair amount of on campus activities (especially during JanPlan). Most people find a group of friends or a team or club that they tend to stick with but there\u2019s a lot of overlap between groups, which I found nice. \n\nThere can be a social divide between non-athletes and athletes, especially with certain teams and when the teams were in season. Not being a varsity athlete, I still did become close with some varsity athletes, but I still felt like a lot of that group felt very separate. \n\nThat being said I had a great time at Colby. I found a few groups of friends I enjoyed, all of which morphed a fair amount year-to-year, and we\u2019d play games, hang out, study together. I joined a few clubs, got close to the people in them, sometimes they\u2019d host more unofficial events. Being on such a small campus did mean that I ran into people I knew all the time, which I really liked. Hopefully that helps? If you have any questions about specific clubs or teams I\u2019d be happy to answer them",

Some people complain about it and I will admit sometimes it can be hit or miss, but what I\u2019ve found is that there are some things the dining halls do well and some they struggle with, and you\u2019ll get a sense of that over time. With three dining halls there are a fair amount of options, so if you check the menus before hand and choose where you go based on that, you\u2019ll probably end up happy with your food a vast majority of the time",

It can be really beautiful but it\u2019s not for everyone. \n\nOutside of that, the summers can get pretty hot/humid, and spring and autumn are gorgeous but short. \n\nThe region of New England has characteristically unpredictable weather, where it can be cold and wet one day and beautiful the next, so it\u2019s rare to have extensive period of clouds, but equally rare to have extensive periods of sun. I love the variation but you\u2019ll definitely want to dress for it, which means layers you can add or remove as necessary",

My sophomore year I was feeling pretty over my head and was definitely very stressed, but I think a large part of that was due to me overcommitting to classes, extra-curriculars, and on-campus work. After that I got much better at balancing my time and I had stressful periods but never at that level. So I think people can definitely get pretty stressed but not everyone and not constantly. Thankfully professors can be pretty accommodating and students can try to balance their schedules accordingly",

It\u2019s sort of a st Patrick\u2019s day celebration that happens on the weekend before Spring break. Basically people stay up celebrating all night and anyone who manages to stay up goes to watch the sunrise from the library steps. The school also hosts events that night and there\u2019s a bunch of free food. It\u2019s a lot of fun. Many people try to last the night every year but most only try once or twice. It can vary a lot person to person but in general it\u2019s pretty fun and lively.\n\nFavorite place on campus? My club had an office that was a lot of fun to hang out in, nothing fancy but just kinda relaxing. Favorite overall though is probably the arboretum (the arb). It\u2019s a size-able forest that surrounds two sides of campus and has a bunch of trails going through it. It\u2019s a really nice place to go for a walk or run or something. Some of the trails come out at the top of the hill by the observatory and there are pretty great views of Waterville and beyond, especially on a clear day",

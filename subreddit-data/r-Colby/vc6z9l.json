            "comment": "S/U lets you take courses \"without worrying about grades\".\n\nYou **can not satisfy any distribution requirement** with an S/U course, **including W1**. You need to take them normally, and get a grade that contributes to GPA. Almost all majors also do not count courses taken as S/U.\n\nFor more details, you should consult the colby catalogue\u2014it's a PDF with details on requirements, policies, and everything else you need to know about academics. Also has major / minor requirements for all departments, and a course list.\n\nThis makes S/U quite limited, because essentially you can only use it for courses besides your major and distribution requirements. It can still be nice, if you want to try your hand at a course in a different department, or a harder course...\n\nWhen you declare a course as S/U (which you have time to do until a month or so into the semester), nothing changes for you or the professor. You keep doing exams and assignments, and the professor grades them. The professor does not even know you are taking the course as S/U unless you tell them. At the end of the course, they give you a grade like everyone else, _but you don't see it_. If it's a C or above, you get an S, you pass the course and get the credits. If it's less, you get an U, so you fail the course and do not get the credits. Either way, you do not see the grade, and it does not contribute to your GPA.\n\nNote that normally you can pass a course with less than a C, but here the requirements a tad higher... in exchange for not destroying your GPA.\n\nIf you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask!",

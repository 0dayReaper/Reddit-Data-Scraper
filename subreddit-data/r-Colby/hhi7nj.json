    "postText": "Hello! I'm a 2024 admit and I am curious how much room is generally offered in the freshman dorms. Specifically, how much desk space is there? I have a full custom pc setup im bringing and the tower and monitor are both on the larger size. Is there at least enough room on the dorm desks for a ultrawide monitor and the keyboard/mouse?",

            "comment": "Yes, that setup should fit on the desks provided.  15 years ago, I lugged a 27\" monitor, ATX tower, 2.1 speakers, keyboard, and mouse from home.  If I stored my keyboard under the monitor, there was plenty of space for books, notebooks, etc.  \n\n\nIf your ultrawide is 34\" it might be a bit tight if you want your case on your desk, especially if you have a full size ATX case.  You might have to place the tower on the floor, under your desk, or to the side of your desk.  mATX or ITX builds should be OK.",

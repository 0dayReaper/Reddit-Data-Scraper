    "postText": "Hey, high school senior here considering ED. The deadline ends in six hours. I've been facing a gridlock between Colby and another school for ED. Likely, nobody will respond in time, but in the off chance somebody does, I have a question that may help me determine things. I'm a real artsy kid. I love pottery and I'm interested in pursuing creative writing and English, as well as environmental studies. I'm the total opposite of athletic. I don't even know the rules to football. Let that tell you something. I'm not a big party guy, either. But I love hiking, I love art, I love the humanities. Oh, and I love D&amp;D. A lot.  Would I fit in at Colby? Would I be able to find \"my people\" there? \n\nI figured it couldn't hurt to ask.",

Last year they all came to my wedding. You will always find what you are looking for at Colby :)\n\nGood luck wherever you go and make sure you keep asking questions!",

Also I\u2019m running a campaign in about 4 hours and almost everyone I know is in a DND group or trying to find space in one.\n\nAlso I did ED myself and it was totally worth it. Removed so much stress. For me it was between Colby and Bowdoin, Colby won out and I don\u2019t regret it!",

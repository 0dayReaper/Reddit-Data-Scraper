    "postText": "just asking which is better to take. ma135 is a two course sequence which seems to cover ma160 (series and multi) as well as single variable calc, but ive already taken that in high school. im not sure whether taking it again would be necessary and i dont really want to spend an entire semester reviewing. the website makes it seems like ma135 is more difficult than ma160 and i kind of just want to take the harder one, so if anyone knows that\u2019d be super helpful",

The prof for honors calc was kind of a bizarre guy and I did not get his methods at all. The prof for multi-variable made me make up all the work I had missed in the 4 weeks of add drop and I got slapped. I'd start in ma160 if I were you.",

I quite enjoyed the professor however, and now a different prof who I can\u2019t vouch for is teaching it. If you\u2019re someone who really likes the technically side of math and sometimes struggles with getting bored in normal math classes, honors is the way to go (I know my roommate ended up really regretting taking multi just cause he didn\u2019t find it as interesting/engaging), but if you want a more normal math experience, stick with multi variable",

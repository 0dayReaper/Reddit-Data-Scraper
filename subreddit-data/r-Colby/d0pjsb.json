Everyone is going out, including one of my good friends. She\u2019s on one of the athletic teams and she has not helped me get into any parties. What am I supposed to do here? I\u2019m having a really tough time.",

            "comment": "Hey my bro!! I also had a really tough time my freshman year and I feel you. (I'm a senior now.) My best advice for making friends? Join clubs. Some Pugh clubs are a really good way to find communities, even if they have their own faults. Other clubs with weekly meetings are like that too. It's scary to go by yourself but it's totally worth it and no one really worth knowing is going to judge you. I never found parties a good place to make friends, so maybe you should make friends and then go to parties? Also dorm events!\n\nAlso, Colby is not that inclusive. You're a freshman, so you maybe don't know, but there's been like swastikas every year on or around campus. And other shit looool. It can be safe place in some ways and extremely not in others. My best advice in general, and also for making friends, is do you, try to be better, and the rest will fall into place. Also, definitely join stuff you're interested in. Sometimes it's also good to learn to enjoy being alone.",

Yes, members of teams typically tend to hang out only with other members of that team, but as a freshman it\u2019s still SUPER early in your college experience. Once you have a more defined friend group you will find parties that you can easily go to and have a good time at. With regard to parties that your roommate is going to, parties for sports teams will be exclusive to start but will \u201copen up\u201d typically around midnight. If you are comfortable enough with your roommate already, you could probably just text her and ask her if the party is opening up\n\nEdit: I wish i could offer more insight but I experienced Colby from the perspective of an athlete",

A lot of times the people you meet during orientation week will not be part of your close friend group, so please do not dismiss it based on the experiences you've had the past couple of weeks. \n\nI have more thoughts on inclusivity based on my experiences as a poc, but not sure whether this is relevant here.",

I\u2019m a senior and was lucky to make a lot of friends through my scholarship group and branch out to Pugh people and friends in my major, but it just takes a bit of time. Join a few clubs, talk to people before class, go to events, ask people to grab lunch. Don\u2019t expect the magical college experience in your first two weeks! Colby\u2019s a weird place and definitely has its issues but you will find your people.",

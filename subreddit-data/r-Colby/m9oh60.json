I know that waitlist chances are also pretty low but I really like the school and would love to know about some fun parts of it! What are some things you like to do in your free time around campus? Where are your favorite places around Colby? Which student events stand out the most to you? Any other things you would like to share?\n\n\nThank you very much for your help!",

I am involved with the Colby Music Incubator (CMI), a student run music collective that throws concerts around the school throughout the year. The concerts are some of my favorite nights at Colby but some of the major events at Colby (like Doghed) are also super fun! If you are interested or still curious please contact me I\u2019d be happy to talk more about it",

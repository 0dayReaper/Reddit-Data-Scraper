    "postText": "Hello Colby College, we've made a college-oriented discord community for students to share ideas, make friends, promote themselves, and discuss college experiences with a laid-back environment. If you are in college or will be soon, feel free to join and talk about how college has been for you, or what you want it to be. If you need people to play games, vent, chat, or study with, consider hopping in to introduce yourself!\n\nInvite Link: [https://discord.gg/y6anv3f](https://discord.gg/y6anv3f)",

Also, I am not particularly close with my parents at all and they are not super invested in or knowledgeable about colleges. I am either flying or driving out and staying overnight. Ultimately, I suppose I just don't know the protocol here.\n\nAdvice or your experience at one of these events would be so helpful!!",

From a general standpoint, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not wrong to go either way",

You also have to think of whether or not you want to have to relay everything you heard/learned/experienced to them once you get back home, or if it'd be better for them to see firsthand.",

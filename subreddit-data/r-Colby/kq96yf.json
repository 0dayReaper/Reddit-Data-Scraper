    "postText": "Hello! I am an international applicant who applied to Colby this year. Colby's website says they \"conduct routine audits of select applications\" to confirm the data provided in them. Does anyone know how this audit is conducted? Does it include phone calls to the people related to the application? I am worried because as an international, most of my recommenders are not used to communicating with native English speakers directly, so this might cause an inconvenience for them. One of my teachers was hesitant to provide me a recommendation solely for this reason. Should I actually be worried about this? Or is it not that serious?",

If you\u2019re somewhere with an uncommon language I\u2019d be worried but if it\u2019s a language like Spanish, French, or Chinese (common classes given at American universities) then that could be a solution. Just notify them of your situation and they can help you as best as they are equipped. Good luck.",

    "postText": "Hi there! I'm a prospective student and am wondering if someone could give me a hand. I've been reading up as much as I can on Colby and the other schools I was accepted to, and I've been coming across several accounts that say that drinking and partying account for the majority of the social scene and activities on campus. \n\nI would really appreciate if someone could let me know if this is indeed the case, and let me know just in general what life is like outside of coursework. Do you feel like there's enough to do, or do you find yourself bored a lot of the time? Thank you!",

I did not really drink during my time at Colby and lived in chem free housing for 3 years.  There was still plenty to do.  I got back into things like D&amp;D, but I also learned some swing dancing and attended regular events with a language club.\n\nI hope that gives you a bit of insight!",

It's kinda hard to get off campus so having a car is super nice. DM me if you wanna chat about anything else that might affect your decision.",

            "comment": "hi! i was recently admitted but i know someone who goes to colby. i can confirm there\u2019s drinking and partying. also this is just my take, but i think any college you go to will have a lot of drinking and partying (there are some exceptions obviously). im sure there\u2019s people at colby who arent as involved with the party scene, and if you really dont want to partake in it, there\u2019s substance-free housing so youll less likely be surrounded by a lot of parties (i think, not sure). \n\nsometimes my friend goes to other cities in maine, and i think there\u2019s a pond by campus? there\u2019s definitely clubs and other stuff to do outdoors, esp since it\u2019s maine. i think campus is pretty big too for a liberal arts college. \n\njust wanna emphasize that i dont actually go to colby, but i most likely will this fall! im just guessing partying is big at colby bc there\u2019s not much else to do in waterville lol. lots of traditions w drinking haha",

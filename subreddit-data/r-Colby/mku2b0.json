Given that the two schools are similar and somewhat close geographically I figure some people here also had Vassar on their list, too. So, if that applies to you, I\u2019d like to ask what made you choose Colby over Vassar? Alternatively if Vassar was not on your list, why did you pick Colby anyway? Thanks!!",

Things may have changed, so I'm sorry if this is different.\n\nThe program is really great, especially the way the intro courses are taught like intro programming.  Each project has open-ended extensions to earn beyond 90%.  The intro programming projects are all art-related, where you apply the things you're learning in class to graphics to create images and/or animations.  Other classes with a similar structure are Computer Organization (232) and Data Structures and Algorithms (231).  \n\nAll the professors that I know are great, and the department faculty has grown a bunch since I was there.  If Dale Skrien hasn't fully retired by next year, I would see if you can take a class or lab with him.  Everyone wants you to succeed, so go and visit them during office hours to ask questions.\n\nThe range of people in intro programming (CS 151) will include those with some programming background and those with none.  Don't be nervous either way.  \n\nPeople are very friendly.  The atmosphere among students is one of camaraderie, not competition.  Enjoy!",

I had the feeling I would have fit in really well there, and I was really impressed with what they were doing.\n\nI visited Colby this spring, and I discovered that their program has grown by leaps and bounds (in a good way).  It definitely has a strong theory base; algorithms are covered pretty thoroughly in data structures, for example.  The curriculum (as I remember it) requires either Advanced Algorithms and Theory of Computation, but you can take both (which I did).  The main core courses also include a lot of practical assignments, so there's no shortage of that either.  It's balanced really well.",

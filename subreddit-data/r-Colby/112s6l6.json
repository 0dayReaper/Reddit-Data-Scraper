    "postText": "So I applied to Colby in the ED2 cycle, I\u2019ve got pretty good grades in my O\u2019Levels(straight A stars) and I\u2019ve got a SAT superscore of 1520 (1510 and 1450 separately). The only problem is that I\u2019m asking for a lot of financial aid. Due to the financial situation in my country(Pakistan) my parents can only afford 13000 us dollars. What are the chances of my admission.",

    "postText": "I don't know where to put this, but let's hope it can get a small bit of traction.\n\nI'm a current freshman at Colby and recently have had some of my housing accommodations for sophomore year rejected. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this? While I'm talking to Disability (Kate) tomorrow, this was sort of unexpected. I'm aware of the whole housing crisis, but I've never heard of anyone having a single rejected (in fact I've heard people accepted over less). It's to the point I'm looking to transfer because of the serious impact living with a roommate has had on me. I've had my previous accommodations granted but just not this.",

I probably would have transferred if it was not eventually accepted, so I might be a little bit familiar with your situation. Did Kate help you apply for the accommodations? I found her (generally) helpful in the process because she told me the specific issues the admin want to see in a petition like this. Sorry to hear about your situation, feel free to DM me.",

PM me if you are still trying to get this figured out. If you are considering transferring over this it is obviously very important to you and needs to be addressed by the school. The only complicated part of this is that Colby is not reviewing housing accommodations again until August. Unfortunately, you will likely not know the outcome of the panel decision until after you could transfer for the semester. The benefit here is that you have several months to get additional documentation, if needed, and create a strong revised application. By now you should know if you were able to get a single though room draw - fingers crossed. Having to dedicate significant effort to convince \"a committee\" that you need basic accommodations can be frustrating and draining. I hope that you can get this resolved.",

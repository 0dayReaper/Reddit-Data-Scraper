    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshmen who\u2019s going to be living in a East Quad double, but with 3 roommates and sharing 2 communal toilets with *up to* 22 people (of the other rooms are overcrowded like mine). So I obviously want to use my space as efficiently as possible. Unfortunately, I have no idea what the room will look like besides the square footage. If anyone can tell me what Colby usually provides for furniture and how much the bed can be raised, that\u2019d be awesome.\n\n\nAlso if anyone knows how to pronounce Treworgy, I also don\u2019t know that. \n\nTLDR: If anyone can tell me what Colby usually provides for furniture in freshmen dorms and how much the bed can be raised, that\u2019d be awesome.",

The bed can be a bit of a pain to raise (depending on how old it is and if you have help), but you can probably get about 3ft of clearance under it. You might be able to lift your bed with another set of legs, but I forget the rules they have on that.\n\nHaha, Treworgy is pronounced true-wer-gee, though most just call it trewj.\n\nAlso it sounds like you may have found it, and I can\u2019t remember if you know your room number at this point, but the floor plans are all online",

I had found the online floor plan but it mostly just told me the bathroom situation and square footage. It\u2019s good to know I\u2019ll have some more storage by raising the bed.",

And 3 people in 190sqft will be a bit cramped but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unheard of. Forced triples (3 in what\u2019s usually a double) are somewhat common among first years, and everyone will still get all the same furniture, it may just take some more deliberate planning on the part of you and your roommates",

This doesn\u2019t include the wardrobe, but you can see the bed, desk, and dresser (some of the dressers are a bit shorter and wider). This was as I was moving in so it\u2019s a bit of a mess",

    "postText": "Hi! I will be applying to Colby as an international applicant. I just had a few questions about the college before applying.\n\n1. My EFC is around $25k and I require some financial aid. How is the financial aid for international students at Colby?\n2. I will be applying as an Econ major. I am also looking forward to studying CS. How are the Econ and CS majors at Colby? What are the internship opportunities, job placements, and grad school placements like?\n3. What are the best and worst things about Colby?\n\nThank you so much! :)",

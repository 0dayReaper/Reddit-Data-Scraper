            "comment": "- Colby professors have research positions they keep open for presidential scholars. I believe you get a list of these and can select your top 3. You\u2019ll get assigned to one of these\n- around 20-ish are selected each year, if I remember correctly?\n- you\u2019ll be expected to work on your project through the year and present on it at the end of the year. The work can vary a lot from lab work to something like individual literary research, and the workload varies from professor to professor but my girlfriend did it and says it was a vary manageable side project for her. I think its not too bad work wise so long as you stay on top of things. And the work the students do is pretty cool! I went to the final presentations my first year and I really enjoyed them",

So you\u2019re only doing one thing, but it can be anything from performing experiments in a lab to something like analyzing themes in a country\u2019s pop culture. So there\u2019s a lot of variance in what the projects look like. You\u2019re required to do it but the actual amount of work involved can vary professor to professor and project to project",

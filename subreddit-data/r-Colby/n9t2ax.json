    "postText": "Hi! I'm a student who's committed to Colby for Fall 2021. I was just wondering how the financial aid appeals work after the first year. I appealed my financial aid this year and got a decreased family contribution, but I was just wondering how it might work next year? Will I have to re-appeal to get the same amount of aid? \n\nI was hoping someone might have been in the same situation. Thank you!",

That being said, I can't speak to your particular case or if they've made any procedure changes. If you want to make absolutely sure, I doubt it would hurt to contact Student Financial Services directly.",

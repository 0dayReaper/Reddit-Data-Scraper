Are the party\u2019s small and cliquey or can you go from one party to another in a single night?\n\n\u2022 If multiple students could reply that would be great so I can get different perspectives!",

Security started to crack down more on how late parties go so in general they start to shut things down at 1 (for certain occasions they let it go later). The only way you\u2019ll get in trouble for drinking is if you start acting belligerent or are caught throwing up. Security are more concerned with keeping people safe than getting you in trouble. Parties will open up to other people i think usually around 11:30 or midnight unless someone specifically throws a party where anyone can go but that\u2019s something you\u2019ll just figure out as you feel out the scene (if you do go there). Once they open up you can bounce around but typically there are only a few that you could go to",

            "comment": "I\u2019ll be a sophomore this year, and I loved the social life and party scene last year. Colby is a small school, so you\u2019ll get to know people pretty fast. I hardly ever walk across campus without seeing someone I know, and it always makes me feel good because it feels very much like home. Gossip can get around pretty fast, but it really hasn\u2019t been an issue for anyone I personally know... there\u2019s just some particular people that built up kinda bad reputations and everyone will know what\u2019s going on with them. That being said there\u2019s also a ton of people I don\u2019t know and I\u2019m always making new friends! I really like the party scene because I don\u2019t find it very exclusive at all. Everyone mostly just goes to the apartments and bounces around between the different parties. I run into all my friends in the hallways and everyone will let you know which parties are good and which aren\u2019t great that night, then you just go find them. Even if some of the parties start out as closed mixers or something they generally open up eventually and everyone is welcome in. Also, same as the last comment, security doesn\u2019t really care about most things, just don\u2019t hold up a handle to them or smoke a joint in their faces :)",

            "comment": "Oh also yeah parties generally go to about 1, but I\u2019ve also been in the apartments until 3am on rare occasions, depending on the apartment I\u2019m in. Sometimes security comes, everyone flees, and then they return afterwards. The people I party with generally go back to the dorms and keep drinking and hanging out after the parties are over, so it\u2019s not like you have to go to sleep as soon as they\u2019re done.",

    "postText": "Hi. I was recently accepted off the waitlist at Colby. But I haven't seen any information related to financial aid on my admission portal. I don't think I could apply for one because my parents did not qualify for financial aid(?) (They earn about 90k a year before taxes) \n\nAre there any ways to get scholarships and/or financial aid from Colby? It's one of my top choice and it's virtually impossible to attend without any financial assistance.",

My family is upper-middle class and I'm paying &lt;$10,000 per year for Colby.\n\nAnd don't be afraid to send them an email. The people at Financial Aid are super accomodating.\n\n[https://www.colby.edu/admission/apply/](https://www.colby.edu/admission/apply/)",

    "postText": "So on the Engineering Dual Degree Program page of the Colby website states that Columbia has had competitive admission starting with the class of 2023. Does that mean it's not guaranteed admission anymore (for reference I've been accepted to be apart of the class of 2025) and if so how do I increase my chances of getting in?\n\nAm I better off just not doing the program and sticking with a Computer Science degree in Colby?",

She also is the head of the CS department! Win-win for you :)\n\nI can DM you her email if you\u2019d like.",

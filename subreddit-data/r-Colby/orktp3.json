            "comment": "So for most lectures you don\u2019t really need to program during the lecture. Sometimes it\u2019s helpful, and many do, but you can get by without it. For most classes I got by with a notebook and pen, so an iPad would fill in well.\n\nLabs, which are centered around programming, will typically be held in a computer lab with machines students can use. Again, some will use their own laptops, but it\u2019s not necessary. You will also be able to use these labs pretty much 24/7 to work on projects.\n\nIts also possible to work on projects from your own machine, but be aware you will need to connect to the Colby server to do so. Mainly, I\u2019m honestly not aware of whether it\u2019s possible to program on an ipad or to connect to remote servers, but it should get you by in classes and projects you\u2019ll be able to do on either your desktop or a lab computer.\n\nOne benefit of a laptop is that you can work in places other than the lab and your room. One benefit of the iPad, in my mind, is that taking notes is much nicer, and it might be easier to use in non-cs courses",

I recently received a gift card and would like to use it to purchase culinary items for my dorm next year, but I'm not sure what is allowed.\n\nThere are nothing online art this except for an old Colby Sawyer College Packing list that says anything over 1200 watts or 15 amps isn't allowed. Is this true? Is there an official list of banned items?",

    "postText": "So I have maaaany questions regarding colby college. I am an international student here and people have been telling me that LAC's are worse than research universities, but as someone who want to study CS and potentially Artificial Intelligence the Davis Institute looks great. What are some of the Pros and Cons of studying in an LAC in your opinion? Does it differ much from research universities? How are the job/internship oppurtunities?",

            "comment": "The big pro of a LAC like Colby is you can network and connect with people much easier than if you're one of thousands in a single class. Colby is growing quickly but still is a \"small\" school where you can get one on one time with profs easily and that for sure pays off in terms of internships/jobs. I know that many big tech companies recruit from Colby.",

Anyways, I do know that Colby has an average acceptance rate of 75%  for med school (here's a useful info link from a thread awhile ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a5qcnr/premed\\_at\\_colby\\_college/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a5qcnr/premed_at_colby_college/)). Also they have an early assurance partnership with Tufts medical school which if you got in, would allow you to skip the MCAT.",

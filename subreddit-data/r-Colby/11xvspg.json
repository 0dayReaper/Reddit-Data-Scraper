    "postText": "I recently received my admission with a full ride. Everything is covered but the issue is that I belong to a really low income family and my laptop is quite outdated. I plan to pursue cs at college and I need to upgrade to a better laptop. I feel embarrassed to request additional aid or loan since I already received such a generous offer. Should I ask the financial aid office for help? Is it something the administration is supportive of?",

            "comment": "So last time I checked (I'm on medical leave since nov so I might be a little out of date) the dean did have a supply of laptops that low-income students were able to use if asked. I think the students could keep them permentantly as well. However, due to the larger than normal influx of new students, those laptops were quickly depleted. But I think if asked, the dean should still be able to help you, and the stock of laptops should be available at the start of the new year. I would contact them as soon as possible just so you can make sure you get one. Seriously they went fast. \n\nThere's also temporary options. Such as loaning for 1 week from the library and computer labs. However, those options aren't sustainable so don't count on them. Hope this helps",

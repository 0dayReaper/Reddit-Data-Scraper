            "comment": "Whitewater rafting is typically done with a company called Crabapple Whitewater on the headwaters of the Kennebec. The company will have a rafting guide with each boat, which in turn will have I believe 6-8 students, one of whom will usually be one of your coot leaders (upperclassmen who run the trip except for the actual rafting part). It\u2019s honestly a ton of fun. You hit some exciting rapids but the guide is there to explain what to do, and everyone has life jackets and helmets. People do sometimes fall out of the boat, but you can typically get hauled back in pretty quickly. There\u2019s also like 30 boats going one after another (most aren\u2019t Colby) so there\u2019s plenty of people to help out if you need it. You don\u2019t need any rafting experience at all (most don\u2019t have any) but I would definitely recommend knowing how to swim. Would definitely recommend it though.\n\nAs far as other coot activities, it\u2019s hard to go wrong. If you want to try something new, it\u2019s a great time to. Sorry if that\u2019s not super helpful but I\u2019d be happy to answer questions about any specific ones! Do you have outdoor activities that you enjoy or have wanted to try?",

I am planning to major in Environmental Science and I am really interested in applying for the program. If someone could give me some insights on it, that would be great.",

Though the original comment is deleted, you should be able to see it if you use a reddit undelete website:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Colby/comments/i9c270/dual_degree_program/\n \nThis was a freshman/sophomore looking to apply. One thing I will add is that I would not give this a major amount of consideration before at least finishing your first semester. Take the classes that interest you, make connections with fellow students and professors, etc. Planning for a program in your junior year before even starting, while admirable, is not necessary and may be more trouble than it's worth. You may completely change your mind about your major, as many or even most students do, and there's nothing wrong with that.",

I think if you want to do the Dartmouth program you need to come into Colby knowing that you will want to do it and need to select your courseload appropriately. You can always decide to not do it, but going the other way will be tougher if not impossible.",

It\u2019s honestly not the best, they can get pretty disgusting especially the guys\u2019. They\u2019re cleaned Monday-Friday. Kinda a \u201cculture shock\u201d thing at first but trust me you get used to it. Make sure to bring a caddy for your things and also shower slides.",

Thing is that they\u2019re well\u2026 downtown (lol) so it\u2019ll be a 5ish minute drive to get to campus. You have to either have a car or take the shuttle a lot.  Also you have to apply to get in one and the application is pretty competitive. Have to demonstrate community service at Colby and also have to pledge to do 20 community service hours in the fall semester. Lastly I\u2019m pretty sure only juniors and up can apply for one",

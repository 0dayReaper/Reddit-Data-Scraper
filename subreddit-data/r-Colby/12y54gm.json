I'm a prospective student so I can't guide you as well as the other amazing people with first hand experience in the comments but Colby's CS program seems solid from what I've seen. The alumni landed good jobs and Colby recently inaugurated the Davis institute for AI I believe. Additionally, the low student to faculty should make for good research opportunities with professors. Are you an admit if you don't mind me asking?",

Scarcity of courses means you arent gonna get as full of a cs education as other schools. Operating systems, database design, computer architecture, etc\u2026 are classes that are very rarely taught if at all but are some of the most useful things to learn. other schools always offer them but colvy does not. However colby still gives the bare essentials so theres that.",

But I do love all the professors I've worked with here and I think I'm learning a lot. It is a really hard major, like notoriously one of the harder ones here, but it's fulfilling and if you really love it you should be good. Most classes are project based, so every week (or sometimes two) you have a coding project you do -- you will usually learn a topic in class and then implement the idea in a project. As of right now, the upper level classes are kind of scarce because a couple of the professors that usually teach them are on sabbatical or away doing some other research endeavors, but all the classes you will need to take in your first two years in the major should not be a problem. There is also an AI department which is unique to Colby, and you can have other CS-related majors like computational biology, data science (i think itll be officially a major next year), or like CS with a concentration in AI. I do know people that have landed top-tier jobs, and as for me I was able to secure a research position with a professor here after my freshman year, and I got a research position at another University for applied computational robotics for this summer (I am only a sophomore rn). Do what you will with the information, I can probably give you more if you need.",

If you want to go into software engineering, go somewhere that offers software engineering courses. Colby CS is VERY theory-heavy. I would only recommend it if you plan on pursuing more CS education after Colby. \n\nIt has been difficult to get up to speed at Microsoft because I didn't learn how to engineer software at Colby, I only learned how to write code and program AI.",

You will be challenged right from the beginning.  The faculty make themselves extremely available and there is a good student-led tutoring group in the department, so there is plenty of help.  Colby doesn't have a grad program in CS, so the undergraduates are the main focus of the department.\n\nI'm not sure why you have the idea that it's a small department.  When I visited a year ago, there were around 200 students in CS, so it's just a bit below 10% of the student body.  \n\nI'm sure there have been a lot of sabbaticals recently, but the department is still quite large.  It could be the case that a lot of those lined up in the same year.  Either way, sabbaticals usually occur every 6 or 7 years, so that's on average going to mean that about one of the faculty members isn't there.  (That's about the same for any good school.)",

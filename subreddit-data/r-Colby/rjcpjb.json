    "postText": "I plan on applying to Colby RD and I have some questions. Before that, here's some background info- I'm an intl. applicant from India and I'm applying test-optional. My school gives a GPA out of 100 (and mine is 84.84). \n\n1) I saw that the overall acceptance rate of Colby is 10% which is way too low for someone like me (I know I can apply ED II but I don't have my hopes high after getting rejected from Grinnell College ED I)  I have high financial need (EFC $20k/yr) and I'm not so confident about my profile, so should I even apply RD? \n\n2) What would you suggest to an applicant like me in my RD application to Colby. \n\nI would greatly appreciate candid and detailed answers.  \nThank you for reading this and please answer if you can :)",

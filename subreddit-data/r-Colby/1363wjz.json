Granted my favorite parts of the social scene were smaller scale hanging out with friends or parties where I knew most of the people there. If you\u2019re looking for a culture of going out to lots of bars and clubs, that isn\u2019t really very possible in Waterville, but it is a pretty social campus and if you find a group that works for you, you can have a great time with it. One of the benefits of everyone living on campus is that there\u2019s usually a fair amount going on on campus",

If you don\u2019t want to have your social events involve drinking, that\u2019s completely understandable, but just know that\u2019s not the default. Colby has substance free housing, which can foster some great friend groups, in my experience. I also found that as people got more settled in college, social scenes moved away from parties and (slightly) more toward hanging out or doing activities with friends. There\u2019s plenty that happens on campus that\u2019s not centered around drinking, but especially as a first year, you may need to look around a bit to find it.\n\nAs far as diversity goes, I\u2019m definitely not the best person to answer this question, as a straight cis white guy. I\u2019d say there\u2019s a fair amount of diversity of sexual orientation, probably a bit less so in terms of race. I think people can find supportive communities within those groups but campus is definitely fairly white. In my experience, nearly everyone finds a group that they feel comfortable with, but that isn\u2019t to say that both race and sexual identity are always easy identities to hold, even at a left-leaning campus like Colby. Hopefully others can share their experiences about their time on campus.",

I\u2019d recommend trying out some clubs or other campus groups, going to dorm and campus events, and talking to people you take classes with all as ways to meet people. From there you can definitely find people who are looking for all different types of social scenes. During your first week alone you\u2019ll meet a bunch of new people from all different corners of campus",

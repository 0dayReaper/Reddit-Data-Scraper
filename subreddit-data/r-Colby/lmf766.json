One of my math teachers, for example, sent a letter of recommendation separately cause she didn\u2019t want to write it in their prescribed form. Really it\u2019s just for anything by else you might have that didn\u2019t fit, so don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have anything to send. Unless there\u2019s something odd about your info you shouldn\u2019t have anything that wouldn\u2019t just go the normal way.",

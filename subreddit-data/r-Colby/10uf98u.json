    "postText": "I've recently gotten very interested in Colby, and was wondering if anyone could tell me more about what it's like being pre-med there\u2014specifically, the quality of pre-med advising, as well as the general support systems that the school offers. I'm also curious about the statistics around med school. I know that Colby has a 75% med school acceptance rate, but I'd love to hear more specifics, like which schools often accept Colby students, and in particular, if many people pursue the Tufts Maine Track early assurance program and get in. Thanks so much!",

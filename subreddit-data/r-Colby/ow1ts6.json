            "comment": "Hillside tends to be mostly first years, which (sometimes) means that you can have pretty decent communities built within individual dorms. Keep in mind that doesn\u2019t happen all the time, and there are tons of other ways to meet people, but knowing a lot of people in your dorm can be very fun.\n\nThe buildings themself were built in the 70s I believe, which kinda led to them being very concrete-y. Unfortunately, they do tend to have slightly smaller rooms and the hallways are rather narrow. On the positive, though, you\u2019ll have big windows, a bunch of smaller common areas (though the buildings are a bit maze-like), and you\u2019re in a cool spot on campus where you\u2019re about a medium distance from everything. I never lived there, but I think consensus tends to be that hillside can be a very fun place to live first year, but later in your Colby career you will probably be ready to try out somewhere else.\n\nHope this helps! And congrats on Colby!\n\nAlso if you have any other questions, feel free to ask",

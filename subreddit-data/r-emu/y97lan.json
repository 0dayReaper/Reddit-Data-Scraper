    "postText": "Remember when you see the administrators celebrate the construction of new buildings they are still letting a private company hold the student body hostage. Each semester parkEMU has raised the prices of commuter passes $10 since 2019. This semester it\u2019s almost $200 and then they closed down a third of our parking commuter parking while not opening the pay lots. We are being squeezed by an immoral company and the EMU administration is letting it happen.",

Forcing people to pay $200 and then on top of that another 10 bucks to park in a PAY LOT? literally the least and I mean LEAST they could do is leave the science center pay lot gates up for the remainder of the year until the parking structure is done but they probably won\u2019t even start maintenance on that until the end of next spring anyway.",

It\u2019d be nice if they opened all the pay lots except for like Alex bc as far as I know not a ton of people park over there since most people have passes I\u2019d imagine",

It needs to be closed to conduct an \u201cassessment of needed repairs.\u201d This being just ONE year after they *originally* shut it down for repairs. What happened? Who\u2019s at fault? When can we expect it to open again? It\u2019s been nearly a MONTH since the announcement was made, it\u2019s time for some answers.",

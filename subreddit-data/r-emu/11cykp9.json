In the past, it worked before. The price does not justify their means or their poor maintenance of the current infrastructure.\n\nYou can leave your comment here:\nhttps://mi-psc.force.com/s/case/5008y000004zxa1AAA/in-the-matter-of-the-application-of-dte-electric-company-for-authority-to-increase-its-rates-amend-its-rate-schedules-and-rules-governing-the-distribution-and-supply-of-electric-energy-and-for-miscellaneous-accounting-authority",

Entropy exists and things like storms happen, just because things don\u2019t come back instantly doesn\u2019t mean that we need to complain about it.",

I didn't realize that until I moved away and lived in other states.",

It was so bad that in my neighborhood lots of people feel the need to have whole-house generators.  Which, I might add, are a lousy solution because they run on natural gas, which means a nice little windfall for the utilities that don't know the meaning of the word maintenance.  \n\n\nI'm not attacking the linemen and the folks out there getting Michigan back online. But this is what you get when you have an underregulated monopoly whose only bottom line, is the bottom line.",

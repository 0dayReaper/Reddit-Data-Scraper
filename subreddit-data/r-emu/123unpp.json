    "postText": "If you have to park off of campus or considering it, remember that is not a choice that you are willing making. You are being forced into that situation by EMU and parkEMU. You are not just being exploited by this private company but you are being oppressed by them. How dare a private company force you to not have the ability to safely park within the campus lots because you can\u2019t pay for their extra fees even though you already paid for the tuition and fees from EMU. How dare EMU let this injustice occur and allow a private company to divide its student body into 2nd and 3rd class citizens.\n\nThe main people who are oppressing you during this whole situation are the parkEMU attendants. These grown men are not part of EMU and have no affiliation with the school other than their employers cheekily named them parkEMU. These people are the ones that enforce the rules and make sure you pay pay either their fees or fines and then they\u2019re the ones that will call the towing company to remove your vehicle. Do not fall into the illusion that these scabs of the universe are just merely trying to get by like the rest of us, they are the right arm of the oppressive body that is designed to exploit you.\n\nWe need to make our voices heard because even if we are just shouting into the void we should not go quietly. Let\u2019s organize ourselves into a bigger protest to show EMU and parkEMU our dissatisfaction of these practices that are forced upon us. In the meantime I encourage everyone willing to tell the parents and prospective students of the tour groups just how we are treated and to put up flyers in the common areas of our dissatisfaction of this ridiculous parking situation. The only reason I encourage this is because I will start to do it in the coming weeks.",

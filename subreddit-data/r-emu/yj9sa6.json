    "postText": "After more than a month a a half some information has been gathered on the closure of the parking structure and the current state of parking for students.\n\n\nThis past summer parkEMU and EMU knew that they were going to close the parking structure this semester while also raising the prices of student parking to almost $200 for this semester alone, with another $10 price increase more than likely coming for the winter semester.\n\nThe claim by parkEMU is that the school let the parking structure rot and are now worried about a Miami structural failure event happening. They are trying to keep this information quiet as they are worried about student backlash.\n\nWith the structure in the shape that parkEMU is claiming there is no current plan to fix or rebuild the structure or improve our parking conditions with employees saying \u201cyou can always use the north lot\u201d.\n\nParkEMU is on a daily campaign to make student commuters that didn\u2019t pay for their bloated prices pay in parking tickets and threats of vehicles being towed. ParkEMU claim that these vehicles are from people that live out in town and have no association with EMU but they know in truth they are only targeting students.\n\n\nEMU has sold the students out to these grifters and slumlords. Maybe we as students should blocking of staff parking or start parking in staff parking. Will they then understand that we shouldn\u2019t be paying $200 just to commute and park at their school and in these crappy conditions?",

I now park over at Riverside Park. As it turns out, the spiteful choice is also the healthier one - I get my exercise in walking to campus, and relax with a nice audiobook along the way.",

I found out recently that there was a federal search at the school to see how EMU is running and they were told to either make their dorms more livable and affordable or name themselves as a commuter school. I really miss the parking structure because as a student athlete, it makes it 10x easier to get to practice and class within a reasonable amount of time and not having to pay 8 dollars a day when I already have a $210 parking pass.",

If you park in staff parking you're probably taking the space of a custodian who pays about the same as you for parking and isn't making a living wage. The rich administrators/board members are the ones paying for the $1000/year private spots.\n\nNow, if you can find a dedicated ParkEMU (or Chartwells) space somewhere...",

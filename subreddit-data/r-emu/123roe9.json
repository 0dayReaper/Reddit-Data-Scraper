We should plan it around the next event that the EMU administration and parkEMU is relying on the pay lots for and block them all off. As a collective we can embarrass EMU as an institution and hopefully create some change. Do we know of any upcoming events that we could disrupt that will make an impact?",

If it can potentially cost the university money they\u2019ll pay attention to it, there was a big event at the student center last week that had the pay lot nearly full so if that was found out ahead of time just a few cars to block could cause a big hassle for them. Get some signs that say \u201cget rid of parkEMU\u201d or \u201clower parking pass rates\u201d or something along those lines. Biggest thing would be keep the signs rated E but refuse to move.",

I know they do a few of those throughout the year but I\u2019m not sure how soon the next one is but we can plan on getting the next one! I\u2019m going to try and look at event calendars and see if we could look at some dates.\n\n\nAnd good point on the flyers! We need to be sure the content is to the point where the school can\u2019t justify taking them down without censorship reasonings.",

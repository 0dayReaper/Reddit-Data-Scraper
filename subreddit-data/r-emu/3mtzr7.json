Still no sign of Watney, he may have been handed off before the joy ride or escaped during the accident. I'll be running around Ford lake today, scouring the area for any signs of him.\nAlso, an anonymous donor has put up a $1000 reward for his safe return, no questions asked. Pass the word on to any friends or family who might be in the area.",

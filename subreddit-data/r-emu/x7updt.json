    "postText": "I know Yp is pretty herb friendly, personally, I don't mind if you do it outside away from the entrances where people don't usually go, but come on. It's basically 2 weeks in and you think it's a good idea to smoke indoors in a dorm?!? I can smell it from my room and it's A LOT stronger in the hallways. Keep in mind you're not supposed to smoke AT all on campus even if you do have a medical card,  ***EMU is subject to the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act amendment of 1989, which prohibit controlled substances on campus.***\n\nIf you want to get high so bad, edibles are cheap AF, and if you want to smoke, carts are a lot stronger and don't produce nearly the stinkiness of just the plant. Please have some courtesy to others living in the dorm with you that aren't so fond of the skunk smell. *You wouldn't want someone to pee in the halls and let it sit for everyone to smell just because they couldn't be bothered to go to some place suitable to do their business. The same applies here.*",

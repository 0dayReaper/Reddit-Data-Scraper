If you don't try to make friends, then they won't come automatically.  If you don't seek help when you need it, then it won't be offered.  \n\nI've had one guy join my fraternity, go out of his way to meet people early on, and tried to blend his culture with ours whenever possible. He had an amazing time and is doing great.\n\nI had another person who never really left our room except for classes, didn't try to interact with classmates, never used his resources, and never looked into extracurriculars. He hated his time there, but it had nothing to do with the school.",

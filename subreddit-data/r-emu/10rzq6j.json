    "postText": "Same as everyone else, I\u2019m sick of parking on campus. I cannot believe a major commuter school has this issue, but here we are. I\u2019m tired of fighting for parking spots and we all pay so much to have to deal with this. I\u2019m also tired of complaining and having nothing get done. \n\nIs there anything we could do to make campus more accessible for commuter students and staff? Where could we direct our complaints to? Are there outside forces we could contact to have help us?",

It's a pretty short walk from the nearby park lots and the bus stop, but people are already think the walk from Green 2 is too long (something I don't get, but I'm clearly outnumbered in that matter).\n\nEither way I'm not giving them another moldy penny. I recommend others do the same.",

This can easily be done without any violence and they all fear that we will turn to it because they know their practices are bullshit.",

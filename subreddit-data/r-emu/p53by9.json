    "postText": "Hey everyone. Just wanted to throw in my two cents about the whole last minute implementation of Easterns \"block tuition model\" being sprung on students right now. I feel like that's price gouging, and would like to know the legality of this. If it's going to be a flat 16 credit payment rate, than those taking over 16 credits should be charged the same amount as those taking under 16 credits. This is an extremely dishonest and scummy way to artificially inflate the 4 year graduation rates. I know of a few students who are having to start GoFundMe pages to stay in school, and another one who's going to be paying for 16 credits to finish the last 9 she needs in order to graduate, and she'll be graduating within the coveted 4 year time frame regardless. The whole thing reeks of greed, and the fact that no one was given a heads up about this prior to going into this semester is a huge red flag. I hope EMU addresses this before it affects their image and they start to develope a shady reputation both within and outside of the state. Most reputable University's would have put this plan into action after an announcement a few years out, not trapping students currently attending the University into a pricing model they may not have been able to pay for when first deciding to attend.",

That's why they did it and that's why they won't waive online fees for courses that don't even have offline options this semester. They refuse to address this except through press releases where they talk about how great of a change this is. I'd really encourage people to keep commenting on their social media to raise awareness about these issues. EMU really hates social media pressure.",

    "postText": "Is anyone else absolutely fucking fed up with this school?\n\nThe price is slightly lower than everyone else, so of course we expect somewhat of a sub-par college experience, commuter or not. \n\nHowever, it's really fucking embarrassing to say I go here: our parking system is ridiculous and unethical to students (more passes sold than spots available??? WHAT THE FUCK), the crime on campus is fucking insane, nothing gets fixed (what the fuck is going on with the dryers in every single bathroom on campus?????), our (non-STEM) classes tend to be pretty shitty (in my experience), the only consistently-available building to study comfortably in is the library (which closes at 10 on weekdays and 5 on weekends), there's zero fucking security (that overnight dorm door check-in system doesn't even happen every night), and--this is kinda petty--Sill hall, the newest on campus, has like 4 or 5 HUGE concrete platforms that are completely useless. \n\nLol, just had to vent. I hate it here. Maybe I'll just be the next person to fall out of the 4th story of Phelps \ud83e\udd70",

I have never lived on campus, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a way different experience than being a commuter. \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right about the parking situation, it is ridiculous. I get to campus 15 minutes early and am still almost late to class because I\u2019m forced to park in the north lot despite my classes being in McKenny. There\u2019s just no spots anywhere closer. \n\nAs far as the hand dryers, I think they were shut off after the pandemic. Quite honestly I like it because I can\u2019t stand hand dryers. I\u2019ll take paper towel all day everyday. I\u2019ve also been pleased with most of my classes. There\u2019s a few not so great professors, but I haven\u2019t had one who didn\u2019t at least know their stuff. Hopefully it gets better for you, I\u2019ve found my senior year to be much more enjoyable than any other. \n\nAlso as the other commenter said, please don\u2019t fall off the fourth story of Phelps &lt;3",

The crime is a little much too. The shooting outside my dorm, people breaking into cars in the residential parking lot, and the armed robberies off campus. Classes wise, they are fine. Advising is a little tricky. The only reason I\u2019m transferring is because I\u2019m from out of state and it was hard making friends especially with emu being such a commuter school.

I took a few years off and then came back, and it's only gotten worse. The administration is so inept that I genuinely believe it would be better for the state to take control of the university. I'm talking full receivership.\n\nSomething I found interesting and depressing: there are students from the 1970s and 1980s that rallied against the very things that are problems now. They protested against parking, campus crime, cost vs. quality, and the poor administrative practices. Their stories are in the university archives if you ever have the inclination to look into it. The only difference is that now their privatizing anything that isn't nailed down-- And even some things that are.",

It hasn't held me back in my career. After a few years no one really cares where you got your degree. But every single time I have to say where I graduated from I'm embarrassed. I can also tell the quality of my education was not on par with my colleagues who graduated from other Michigan universities.\n\nEMU can be great for some people.

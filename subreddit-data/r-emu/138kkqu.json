    "postText": "I applied to EMU as a freshmen, but now I think I\u2019d be considered a transfer student. I\u2019m a senior in high school and I\u2019ve take several dual enrollment classes, with credits totaling up to 18. Would this change anything? I know that it adds another official transcript I\u2019ll have to send, but other than that? Plus I\u2019m a presidential scholar, would that change that? I\u2019m calling the offices but they are closed right now, so until they open I was seeing if I could possibly find any answers\u2026",

            "comment": "While you do qualify as a transfer student, I suggest you still make sure to get on the phone with the admissions office. The way they treat transfer vs freshmen is wildly different. Perhaps it would be the same credit transfer even if you applied as a freshman.\n\nI was a transfer as well as several of my friends. When you transfer, they kind of just admit you into the school and forget about you. Presumably because they assume you already know the whole deal with being in college. It\u2019s probably better if you get invited to all the freshmen orientations/events so you make friends and can join clubs easily.",

There are a ton of dual-enrollment/early college students at EMU, so they probably have more experience than most colleges with first-year transfers. Congratulations on becoming a pres scholar and good luck!",

I had &gt;18 credit hours, but definitely was still treated as a freshman for all intents and purposes.\n\nObviously check with the office, but expect to be a freshman - just with a nice buffer of credits.",

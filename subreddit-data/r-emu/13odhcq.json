Why does EMU keep outsourcing campus maintenance? UofM does not outsource their power, and has its own energy grid, separate from A2, and does not have the electric problems to its grid, like the rest of A2.",

The issue being outsourced and now the utilities are examples of a shrinking, a d eventually dying institution.\n\nWith all the other options to obtain a post secondary education, institutions like EMU are the first of the old brick and mortar education institutions to fail at keeping up with the times.   Basically, they are unable to adapt and complete.  They took ingrained in the past and their own self importance.  \n\nOutsourcing is an example of self admitted incompetence.  They lack the skill and or will to run a facility.  This is partially a product of a shrinking customer base.\n\nBrick by brick they are falling behind when students and prospective students make choices in purchasing education.  Eventually, dinosaurs become extinct.",

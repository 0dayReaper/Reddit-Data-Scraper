So, the questions will focus on those five main qualities. \n\nTreat it like a job interview. Practice answering questions around those 5 things. Also, practice being adaptable (answering on the fly). They might ask you more questions outside of the traits listed above. Always be confident with every response. \n\nFor anyone applying in the future: you got this! Good luck!",

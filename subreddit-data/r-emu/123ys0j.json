I would be more than happy to do something more substantial and suggest we target the pay lots, tour groups, and post flyers across campus. Is there anything that that you would suggest that would create the impact that we need in getting rid of parkEMU? I guess the better question is what steps should we take to organize ourselves to take on EMU and parkEMU?",

I have a few thoughts.\n\n1. In a comment from about a month ago, you suggest trying to make the third party bane of our existence's employees \"regret making our lives miserable\" by...following them around in our cars. Please don't do this? There is no clause in laws about harassment that states it's okay if the person is a scab.\n2. The flyers currently posted really aren't that productive. I'm paraphrasing, but I think they just say \"F\\*\\*\\* ParkEMU\" and have a QR code to email the president. I don't disagree, but I don't think putting up flyers that are 100% bound to get torn down for profanity is super productive. I also don't think the office of the president could give less of a shit, tbh. I've sent emails before and gotten absolutely nothing in reply, and the chief of staff or whatever he is is INCREDIBLY bureaucratic and irritating.\n3. The main question that needs to be answered before any action can be taken (maybe someone already has and I'm just in the dark) is whether or not EMU even CAN break the contract early. \n\nI'm not a legal expert, but Provident and EMU are currently beefing over the parking structure. I think that we should learn more about this and if possible, use it as ammo. Here are the most current articles I've found about it, but one is paywalled: [March 3rd](https://today.emich.edu/story/news/12330) [March 21st, EMU's response to Provident's filing of a lawsuit](https://today.emich.edu/story/statement/12349) [Paywalled, but a MI fed judge dismissed Provident's lawsuit](https://www.law360.com/articles/1588692/judge-tosses-11m-suit-over-mich-school-parking-contract)",

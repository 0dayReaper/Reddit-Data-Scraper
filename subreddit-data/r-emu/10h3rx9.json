[(link here)](https://www.emich.edu/it/getting-help/university-licensed-software/index.php) Psychological services from CAPS is free, and unless you opted out of the $50 charge you get access to the Rec/IM center and all it offers. \n\nDefinitely make sure you\u2019re looking into any student discounts for subscription services and online stores. I have a premium Spotify, Hulu, and showtime bundle for just $5 a month.\n\nThere\u2019s probably some I missed. I\u2019ll be coming back to this thread cause this interests me too",

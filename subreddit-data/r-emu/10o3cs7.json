It's a small 4 year university, so you don't get access to cool research stuff like at Michigan, but when you do research you can be under a professor not a GA. \n\nSame with classes, if you get a good teacher class sizes are usually small enough you can get some real quality time with that teacher, however if they're a bad teacher there often isn't another one teaching that course.",

            "comment": "Best thing for me is the size of the school. Big enough to where it doesn\u2019t feel like a shopping mall, but not too big where it\u2019s painful in wintertime. This goes for student size too. You\u2019ll find a decent number of alumni in the se Michigan area and you\u2019ll still see people you know on campus between classes (assuming you know a few lol.) \n\nPretty much everyone will tell you ParkEMU is the worst thing about it. This sub has a lot of good info that\u2019s covered the topic. \n\nAs far as advice goes, it\u2019s very cliche, but please GET INVOLVED. 4 years ago I sat there thinking \u201cI\u2019m a commuter who has all my friends and girlfriend back at home. This is just school I don\u2019t need to get involved.\u201d After my first semester, I quickly found out that it tends to get lonely being on your own for many hours of your day. I tried making friends in the second semester, but then the pandemic hit and we all went online. \n\nIn my Junior year, I joined a marketing club called American Marketing Association (AMA). It was hard for me to do, and I really had to push myself, but I\u2019m immensely glad I did it. I\u2019ve met some great people and my experience on campus has improved tenfold. I\u2019m even serving on the board for it now. It opens up many opportunities to do fun things and makes you feel like you have a sense of belonging at the school. This is why I highly recommend starting early, so you have even more opportunities to make memories. \n\nYour experience will be what you make of it. If you push yourself to get outside your comfort zone and try new things, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll absolutely love it. If you don\u2019t though and you treat it like high school (which I did for my first two years) it\u2019ll feel underwhelming. It\u2019s a big and new change in your life, good luck and be sure to enjoy it!",

Even after dismissing the very people who they claim were offended, they came up with a bland replacement mascot.  The Regents and President Shelton were both offensive and patronizingly dismissive because their agenda demanded the Huron Tribe be offended but they weren't.",

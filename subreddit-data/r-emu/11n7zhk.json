But campus is right next to the B2B connector south of the athletic fields, which you could take around St Joe's/WCC and out to the Matthaei paved trail which would be amazing to longboard. I don't actually own one myself but have been looking into it the past few weeks for the sole purpose of hitting up Matthaei.",

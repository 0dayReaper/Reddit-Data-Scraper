Though its novelty may be a selling point to bring in a larger student body that may not know the risks, or know their own limits yet.\n\nThat is another thing as well, any of these meetings whether it be an RA event, or Campus wide event, they want to generate numbers, and a good way to do that is through advertising Pizza, shot glasses, t-shirt, Etc. the list goes on forever. It's a tactic, and who knows it may help some people.",

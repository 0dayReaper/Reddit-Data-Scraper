So I ended up with a lesser degree that didn\u2019t require an internship. So now I have a bronze medal with no experience in my field.",

Most big companies open applications in August/September, while smaller local companies start looking around January. Large companies often will pay for housing if you are not local to their area. I spent a summer in Kansas City working on aircraft avionics. There is a small internship fair in the winter semester with mostly local companies. \n\nSoftware developer interviews are fairly standard in terms of content. They usually require a coding assessment, and some in person interviews on design, algorithms and data structures, and your soft skills. You\u2019ll learn all these in your CS classes.",

This will get you to the first round interview with a lot of employers, and usually the skills assessment.  ASU probably has a better career services department with access to more employers, EMU will have access to more employers local to Michigan.",

I don\u2019t assume they\u2019d be offered by or through the school, you\u2019d have to look for them from companies that are hiring. We do have our own job posting board, however. Companies post onto it when they\u2019re specifically looking for interns or fresh college grads. It\u2019s called handshake, and I\u2019m pretty sure other universities use it too. Sometimes professors and clubs have connections too. If you look I\u2019m sure you can find one. \n\nBeyond that, my knowledge of computer science can be summed up to, \u201cI hear it\u2019s in demand\u201d. I really know nothing about the field",

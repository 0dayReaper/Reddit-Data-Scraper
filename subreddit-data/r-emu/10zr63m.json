    "postText": "Was just scrolling this sub and saw all the complaints about them. Yeah they\u2019re total ass. \n\nJust fyi you don\u2019t have to pay for their parking tickets as long as you don\u2019t get 6 of them. After the 5th one, so on your 6th ticket, they can tow your vehicle, but until then they can\u2019t do anything. \n\nI verified this long ago before someone says \u201cthey won\u2019t let you graduate!\u201d. That\u2019s a myth. Also park emu isn\u2019t real police enforcement no matter how hard the guy working the front desk tries to cringley say they are. So if your friends or parents visit or whatever let them eat the ticket if there\u2019s nowhere else to park and then never think about it again. It will not come back to haunt them or you via court or anything. Once again EMU ticketing is not real police ticketing.",

There is no way for them to stop you from graduating just like they can\u2019t verify if the people they are harassing in the parking lots are students or some random from ypsi while knowing full well that they are just pointed at ensuring the student body pays their toll for the semester.",

    "postText": "When I came here (with an unrelated first bs degree), I originally thought of doing the computer science grad program and am so glad I didn't. I searched this sub for information back then and didn't find this anywhere, so I want to get it out there.\n\nThe graduate computer science program here is a complete joke: [https://catalog.emich.edu/preview\\_program.php?catoid=40&amp;poid=17645](https://catalog.emich.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&amp;poid=17645)\n\nEvery single course under \"Foundational Coursework\" (12 credits) is just an undergraduate computer science course relisted as a 500-level course: as-in, you will be in a classroom with all undergraduates studying undergraduate material. In almost all circumstances, there is no difference in the course expectations between undergraduates and graduates. When there is a difference, it is something extremely minor.\n\nThere is a *singular* 600-level (non-undergraduate) course offered each semester, which grad students are compelled to take to meet their requirements of taking 9 credit hours at that level.\n\nDon't be fooled by professors that try to push you into this busted program. There are people in this program that graduated with a CS undergraduate and are now paying graduate-student rates to repeat the class material.",

I\u2019m almost done with my IS undergrad degree and the professors all seem to be checked out and only there to collect a paycheck. \n\nI\u2019m not paying to listen to someone read slides from PowerPoint. I honestly learn so much more from YouTube lol.",

            "comment": "I completely agree, unfortunately for us the EMU administration sold out the student body to the Texas based LAZ parking to create parkEMU. Ever since they jack up the prices for the parking passes and provide us with 2/3 of the parking that was available 2 years ago. This company only uses us as a money resource to funnel back to Texas. There has been zero work done to improve our parking since this company started masquerading as a part of EMU and the attendants claim that they are chasing away people from in the city from our lots but they have no resource to prove that they are actually in fact harassing students that either can\u2019t or won\u2019t pay their egregious parking prices. \n\n\nNow that the weather is starting to get worse expect a warning email for students to stay and park in their proper parking lots. This company was hired to keep us in our place.",

    "postText": "I started going to EMU basketball games the past few weeks. I enjoyed them and had a great time. I\u2019ve always loved the charm of the smaller conferences especially the mid American. But after the Ohio game on the 31st of January I walked back to my truck to find somebody wrote \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d in the dirt on the side of my truck. I reported it to emu ethics late yesterday. It\u2019s just sad someone  would do such a thing. I definitely do not feel like it\u2019s worth the risk of actual damage to my truck to go back ever again to basketball or football",

It\u2019s always a shame when stupid people do stupid things like that, and I\u2019m hoping the ethics department gives you a respectful and meaningful response. \n\nIf I may ask though, why do you attribute this to EMU athletics? I get it happened in the parking lot, but sadly it could happen anywhere. Ypsi is the most diverse city in Washtenaw for that matter. I would say try not to let the idiot keep you from doing things you enjoy, that\u2019s how they win",

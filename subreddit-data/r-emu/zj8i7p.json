            "comment": "I think to a degree some Ann Arbor people look down on Ypsilanti, but I don\u2019t believe it to be the majority of people. I see many people from Ann Arbor visit our restaurants and bars after Michigan football games. I hear many U of M fans say supportive things about Ypsi. Some don\u2019t, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re a true representation. \n\nLike others have said, EMU is mostly a commuter school. As a commuter I can\u2019t really speak on many relationships between students of both schools, however I do believe there to be a slight difference in culture/perception. \n\nI highly respect a lot of students that go here. I find they don\u2019t often come from very wealthy households and are working round the clock to make ends meet and better themselves. A lot of people I know who went to U of M came from wealthy backgrounds and were given the tools they needed to succeed. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with either situation, it\u2019s just very different between the two. Sometimes people from either background don\u2019t take well to the other, and they may tend to avoid them. I think that\u2019s the core of any issues between students from the opposing schools.\n\n\nEdit: it\u2019s slightly off topic but I wanted to add that I find Ann Arbor drivers to be the absolute worst. Maybe I\u2019ve just had bad luck with them, but anytime I take I-94 east home I see many Ann Arbor decals and plate frames flying past me and cutting people off. I go 75-80 so these people are going 90+. Crazy out there",

Lately it feels like Ypsi is becoming the \"quirky\" place for the A2 yuppies to visit on the weekend if they're tired of all the restaurants in Ann Arbor.",

Eastern is has a median family income of 75k and &lt;1% of student body from the 1%.",

Out of state tuition at umich is around $40k. I am however an EMU student and all of my friends attend UofM. EMU is largely a commuter school and I wouldn\u2019t say it has a very strong community unless you live in the dorms or join a frat/sorority.",

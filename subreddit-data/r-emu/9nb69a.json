This person is getting paid your tuition money; and since its a public school she's also receiving tax dollars. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe asked me to her office for a 1 on 1 meeting; then she started screaming at me over a disagreement we had on how to discipline an undergrad. I told her I felt uncomfortable and got up to leave; she rushed from behind her desk and forced the door closed, preventing me from opening it. She gestured with her free hand that she was going to hit me; I took out my cell phone and said I was going to call the police. That is when she let me out and I went promptly to the on-campus police department and filed a report.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBe warned. This professor has a history (not just me) and EMU protects her. That is what your tuition money is going towards.",

From what I remember she did seem to be a little more strict and maybe even crass with the way she explained certain things. I remember she had this absolutely stupid policy where someone\u2019s phone ringing in class would result in a loss of points for the entire class. So I can definitely understand that she would stick to her rules about lab sign ins. And she definitely had a more crude sense of humor. She used to berate engineers a lot for being the \u201cblue collar workers of science\u201d. \n\nSo I definitely think what you\u2019re saying could have happened, but at the same time I don\u2019t think anyone wants to start raising pitchforks without proof first. Is there something you can show as proof that this happened?",

In 2016 I sought out a few lawyers who told me that the statute of limitations had expired for this kind of wrong-doing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps it is time to go to the media; its not exactly something I like re-living; but its hard to avoid when you re-live it in your nightmares. I just can't understand why the University would do nothing about this professor. I had my undergrad from EMU, graduated with honors, was on great terms with quite a few of my professors (so good that I got my name included as an author on several of their research papers). They did nothing ; they acted like this is no big deal. In any other industry creating an unsafe work environment by assaulting a co-worker would almost always result in immediate termination; particularly when its a boss abusing their power by assaulting their subordinate employee. This was just ignored.",

Absolutely unacceptable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the way; the disagreement that set this whole thing off:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe wanted me to fail a student who forgot to sign into the Physics lab. This was a student I had been working with because her financial aid got mixed up ; She wasn't allowed in the lab until her financial aid was sorted out; fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then she finally got her financial aid sorted out and came to lab; but forgot to sign in. Well according to Jacobs rules she missed 3 sign in's and therefore is an automatic failure. It didn't matter that she turned in her lab report that day; that I saw the student and talked to the student during the lab they supposedly missed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways Jacobs sent an incredibly condescending and snotty email to this struggling student to let them know they failed and just wasted their financial aid money ; and I told her I disagreed with the tone she used. Thats what led to her assaulting me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have to say I'm quite certain there is a racial component involved the student was a young black woman.  I've never seen such unnecessary callousness but maybe extreme prejudice or racism would explain that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEssentially the University allowed her to enroll in this course before her financial aid went through; but due to Jacobs arbitrary rules she isn't allowed to attend until her FA is finalized. Then her FA is finalized but now she forgets to \"sign in\" one time ; which then is an automatic failure for the student. I mean the whole thing seemed like a scam but I only objected to the condescending and rude way that Jacobs informed this woman that EMU was taking her money and she could try to enroll again next semester.",

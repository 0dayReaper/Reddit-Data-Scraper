            "comment": "Sorry, meant to reply to this earlier. As the other commenter said, it\u2019s not all too difficult. The classes (imo) are interesting and every professor I\u2019ve had has been (at the very least) knowledgeable about what they\u2019re teaching. Many of them do consulting and have many years of experience in whatever field the course is about. Not every professor is a slam dunk, there\u2019s certainly a few who are a pain, but for the most part I\u2019ve been happy with mine. \n\nI would say I\u2019ve been satisfied with my experience, though I don\u2019t have much to compare it to. Lots of business clubs to join too. Everyone says good things about SHRM. I\u2019m a part of AMA and as a commuter, it\u2019s been a fantastic way to meet and really connect with new people. I feel like I have actual friends on campus whereas I didn\u2019t know anyone before. \n\nOverall I\u2019d say pretty good. Solid professors, not too difficult coursework, lots of extracurricular opportunities. We used to have a COB building but it was off campus and a pain to get to. The uni sold it and now put all COB classes in random buildings on the main campus. There\u2019s been plans to build a new one, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gotten anywhere yet.",

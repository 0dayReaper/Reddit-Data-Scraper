    "postText": "I'm under no illusions that I'm some sort of definitive expert on parking, the politics of higher education, or business.  I also am not sure exactly how I can be useful on the ground in changing the situation in regards to the parking crisis, or the broader issues at EMU that it is symbolic of.  But damn it, I love Eastern Michigan.  Specifically I love the people that made that space a place for me to become a better version of myself than when I arrived, and I want that to be the experience for everyone who chooses to go there.  Shoutout to everyone on here who has already contributed to the discourse.  I know there've been disagreements about the best course of action going forward, but trying multiple strategies might be what it takes to make progress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Boycott**\n\nPragmatically the best way to punish ParkEMU, LAZ, Provident, and their mishmash of holding companies is attacking them financially.  That's the reason the garage is closed, restrict supply of parking spots, and squeeze more money out of people they'd otherwise only get money from when they're buying a permit. Every empty pay lot spot is losing them money, and in the wake of a year + of virtual learning, I imagine their financial situation was not satisfactory to the folks at the top of the food chain.  If everyone with a permit parked in a permit lot, the only money they make daily is off visitors to campus, a much less reliable income stream than students and staff.  The biggest obstacle to boycotting pay lots is distance.  Campus is surrounded on two sides by residential neighborhoods, one side by a business district, and the other side by an active railroad and the Huron River.  I've researched the City of Ypsilanti's maps for West Cross St Business District Parking, Residential Permit Parking, and Google Street View over the past few days.  My first conclusion was that the Residential Permit system is deliberately designed to keep students from parking in College Heights, Normal Park, and especially in Depot Town west of the River.  Considering the size of the campus it makes sense that any plan should include parking in as many different directions as possible.  To the North of Campus, I can't verify these options work but it might be useful to check out Eastern Plaza and parking on Railroad St.  To the East of campus, Frog Island Park is a definitively viable option, but there is street parking on Washington St. between Huron and Cross as well as on Huron between Cross and Washington as well.  To the South of campus there aren't any options unless you want to risk a ticket, Hiawatha doesn't seem to have any restrictions, and Sherman is 90 minutes from 8-4.  West of campus things get easier I suppose.   Permit restrictions here only run one block into College Heights from Oakwood, and Gregory between Louise and Cornell looks to be ok on the permit map but I can't verify if street parking is allowed.  I didn't do any research into whether there are pay lots off campus that are cheaper (probably not).  None of these are great options in terms of location in comparison to where people need to go, and it needs to be acknowledged that this is biggest obstacle to a boycott.  However, boycotts are never particularly convenient for anyone, and taking these extra steps is a demonstration in and of itself of how fed up people are.  This course of action would be more effective with the organizing of carpools, as well as communication about when commuter lots are full and which areas off campus still have available parking.  Putting the financial squeeze on ParkEMU is certainly going to get the attention of its ownership.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Protest**\n\nI don't believe that protesting and boycotting are exclusive options, doing both is going to have more impact than either would alone.  I also don't believe that the issue is ParkEMU employees FWIW. they're just pawns of the investment firm that runs the whole thing and I doubt their higher ups give a shit about them.  The way I see it is that Provident would probably use destruction of equipment or harassment of employees to either get the University to crack down on student protests or to use against EMU in any legal proceedings.  The University has issued a Notice of Default against Provident for the way they've handled the garage. Considering admin / BoR stances on their private partners in the past, the fact that there was a public statement critical of Provident is a sign of possibility to achieve movement.  I would hope there's a possibility that public figures and members of the community in Ypsilanti will side with students in this fight too, considering the reaction of some Councilors when EMU initially sought to privatize parking, it's not out of the question.  But the signal will be students (and possibly staff) taking action on the ground, and holding some feet to the fire.  There are by in large part two ways to solve most social issues (which let's be clear this is) money, and community.  There needs to be a sign that we have enough community at Eastern that it's force to be reckoned with.  I have immense pride in my alma mater, I know that's not exactly common (some might say it's foolish), and if you view your time at EMU as a transactional experience that's fine too.  Hell, part of what was so great about going there (transferring in as a 23 year old Junior mind you) was the variety of college experiences everyone was having in the same place.  But like I said at the beginning it was the experiences, the people, and the lessons I learned that make this place special to me, not the parking contractors or administrators.  That personal investment in this place (which happens to occupy a certain space) that each of us makes is not only what makes it important to me, but also what will hopefully lead to change.  This school has made too many bad decisions in the name of money, a plight that is hardly unique to here, or anywhere else in the world for that matter.  Maybe they can blame it on budget issues.  But hey, I think the State of Michigan needs to spend more of my tax dollars on education too.  Regardless, these decisions impact us, so it is on us to fight them.  We as a community have to say we are tired of the folks who are putting education first being sold out by those who want to squeeze every dime out of this space they can.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope that this is all at least somewhat helpful in solving this.  Good luck, and Go Green.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are the links to the maps I mentioned earlier:\n\n[Residential Permit Map](https://cityofypsilanti.com/DocumentCenter/View/3716/Residential-Parking-Map-and-Street-List_2022-08-18?bidId=)\n\n[West Cross Map](https://cityofypsilanti.com/DocumentCenter/View/3220/westcross-parking-2021-11-29)",

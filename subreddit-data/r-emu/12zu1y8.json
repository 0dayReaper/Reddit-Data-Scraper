    "postText": "I work in Manchester over the summer and need a place to live from around 5/1 to 8/20. I only have a semester left for my masters before I likely move back down again, so maybe arrangements could be made for 12/15 onward, but that's up in the air atm. My priorities are price and location (the farther southwest, the better). I figure there's probably someone who needs the last few months of their lease mopped up, so this might be a good place to find it on short notice.\n\n22M, engineering management, don't smoke, hardly drink, don't have pets, have lived with women on and off with no issues. I mostly just work out and play video games when I'm not working tbh.",

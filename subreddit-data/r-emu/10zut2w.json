EMU is usually very slow to renovate things and the building does NOT look like the digital rendering on the banner in front of the construction site now, so I had little faith. Here's a link to the dimensions of the rooms. The page also has a link to the \"complex plan\" which will show you where the rooms are. [https://www.emich.edu/residencelife/first-year/downing.php](https://www.emich.edu/residencelife/first-year/downing.php)\n\nThere aren't any pictures because A) as a largely commuter school, the online community of people who live in dorms/share info about them is sparse and B) they're renovating the entire building, inside and out, so the pictures of what you'll live in do not exist yet.",

The building itself and your floor will have both boys and girls (and other genders, but to keep it simple here). However, you will only share a bathroom and living area with the same sex.",

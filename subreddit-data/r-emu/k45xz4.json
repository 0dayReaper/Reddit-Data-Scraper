We have a pool, excellent gym, tons of software available, stuff like that. \n\nAlso - Get into a job within your future career asap. With that scholarship, you won't necessarily have to pay as much, but working within your field before you graduate will make your future life 100% better! Aim at internships, volunteer, talk to professors whom might able to help place you somewhere. That is AT LEAST as important as your actual degree will be. I graduated well, but work in a different field than my degree because I didn't do any of these things. Not that I am not happy, but it is hard to switch careers to a significantly lower paying job once you do graduate.",

If you do live on campus my advice would be to get to know those who live in your hall and follow up on what was said here. There are wonderful programs and extracurriculars that are offered that really are worth it (many of which are very affordable or free).",

I did go back as a transfer student in my 30s after getting a ton of credit hours and leaving college many years earlier, so mine was not the typical experience. I didn't even get a student ID in the 2 years I attended (very part-time)!  Hahaha. I just graduated last spring by some miracle. Most of the administration is not wonderful. Appointments are almost always during working hours (8-5) and that makes required advisor sessions very difficult of you're working. Happy to chat any time.",

Tuition is expensive compared to Wayne State and the school wanted 124 credit hours instead of 120 for a Bachelors Degree. Services aren't outwardly advertised. You do indeed have to find everything available unlike Wayne State, I transferred in and probably won't finish my degree at Easter but I have enjoyed the classes",

I lived on campus last year as a freshman in Best (the honors dorms) and I met absolutely no friends there, and I really tried to connect with people! I\u2019m not sure if other dorms are different. Eastern is for sure primarily a commuter school and feels more like a community college because campus life is so dead. There\u2019s really never anything going on during the weekends, and I found it hard to connect with people. The gym is super awesome and I liked the exercise classes a lot, specifically the yoga class and spin class, but also keep in mind that using the rec center is $50 a semester. Park EMU is GARBAGE and they will ticket you any chance they get, and last year the parking was not very clear. Because they are a private company, I learned that as long as you have less than 6 tickets you really don\u2019t need to pay them. The rule is that if you have 6 tickets you get towed, but they can\u2019t do anything if you have less.",

            "comment": "congrats on the free money.  I don't know what major u'll do, that matters a lot cus some majors will take more time than others, but self-advocacy is key.  Ultimately I'd recommend getting heavily involved on-campus by the end of ur 2nd year.  If u dont know what to study yet, I'd recommend taking a year off (unless u lose ur scholarship) to find what u're gonna study cus college ain't cheap and it's not for exploring.  That money will prolly cover about 2 years of school so the other 2 years will come from somewhere.  Each individual is built differently so we prioritize different things more than others.  EMU is what u make of it.  There are resources and opportunities available to u and no one will find u and give it to u.  If there's a problem, they'll address u first and not ur parents.  This is an adult environment and most faculty members aren't there to hold ur hand through undergrad.  If anything, they'll be dicks to u abt it.  It is what it is.  Good luck and congrats again",

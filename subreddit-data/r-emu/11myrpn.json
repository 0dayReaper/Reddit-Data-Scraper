You won\u2019t always have a choice (especially freshman year) but I\u2019ve done nearly all. I\u2019ve done all online, 4 days in person, 3 days in person, and I\u2019m currently at 2 days a week with in person classes. \n\nI find that I like to be in person, but having days with no in person classes really lets me get a lot of work done. I\u2019d recommend going for 2-3 in person days, but it just depends on what you like and what works best for you.",

Some majors have more labs/in person courses that require more time on campus and less flexibility in modality. Some programs are mostly hybrid or online and only meet in person 2 days a week max.",

This semester and last, I was on campus four days a week for my in person classes and it really worked well for me. If you\u2019re able to register quick, you\u2019ll have a lot of flexibility in choosing what works best for you. \nOnline classes are nice, but there\u2019s are a lot of fees associated with it. I had to pay a fee for a hybrid class that was close to $50 and to take a fully asynchronous class was $230. I think these fees are incredibly unfair (especially when some classes are only offered online!), but college loves to eat people\u2019s money lol. If you have the want and the finances, do some online classes. As knagy17 said, it\u2019s really nice to get work done, but the cost is somewhat hard to get behind. Especially if you\u2019re worried about student debt or just additional costs to your tuition bill. \n\nGood luck with everything!!",

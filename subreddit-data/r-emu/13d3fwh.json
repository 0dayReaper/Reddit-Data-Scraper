            "comment": "There are a few evening classes. The campus, department offices and professor hours are more daytime schedule 8 to 5, campus kinda shuts down at 5:00 PM. If you need tutoring for math, this past spring 2023 semester, limited daytime in person hours TH closes at 5, MW closed, at  2:45 or 3:45. From my experience the online math tutoring was limited, the tutor was unable to help me online via Zoom, due to him needing some reference books from the math lab, to help with my homework problems. The math lab hours availability didn't fit with my course schedule, having classes most of the day. The math lab on campus should open later at 10:00 AM/11:00 AM, and close sometime between 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM. Also depending on the food market location for hot cup of coffee or a snack it closes early. The library is open until 10:00 PM, limited hours on the weekend, and the market/coffee shop in the basement is closed. Before Covid, the library was open until midnight and the market/coffee shop was open. It seems EMU cut back on hours in different areas due to Covid, and didn't go back to those hours after Covid. The University generally does not have classes on Friday, some professors kinda want to keep to a 4 day work week. I thought that was a bit unusual very limited classes offered on Fridays due to my experience attending other universities, and we had classes on Fridays. For example some of my chemistry/biology courses we would have lab on Friday, and lecture on Monday/Wednesday, or my foreign language course, we had class every day, one hour, Mon-Fri. If you need testing accommodations for the Cate Lab, it closes at 5 PM, it's does not cater to night class hours.",

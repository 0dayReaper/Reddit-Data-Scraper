    "postText": "Move-in was delayed until 9/17 (unless you had a legitimate reason to be on campus during the weekend move-in was originally supposed to take place), and most if not all classes are online now. I have a feeling that once that date rolls around, we won\u2019t be on campus then, and that anyone who moved in early will be forced to leave. I hope that doesn\u2019t happen \u2014 I have a terrible home life and campus is my only escape \u2014 but since people want to act like complete fucking jackasses and not wear a mask or social distance, it seems inevitable. Anyone else fearing this?\n\nSorry for the foul language, but I\u2019m just tired of the virus and people being selfish and not realizing how it affects others around them.",

I really wish I had some words of comfort or inside knowledge of a plan, but it seems like all of the schools in the area are trying to not lose money more than care about the students. I hope your situation improves.",

            "comment": "Yea I kinda get that feeling too. I think they made the right call though with delaying in person for the first three weeks. I think cases will absolutely explode with Labor Day and some schools that aren\u2019t properly equipped reopening with in person instruction. Past then, I think it\u2019s up in the air but I do think EMU will try to do all they can to allow in person instruction. Especially with all the planning and prep work they\u2019ve done to try to make it safer",

Most classes are fully online for Fall though.\n\nMask up, wash hands, and maybe keep an eye on [EMU COVID-19 Dashboard](https://www.emich.edu/coronavirus/dashboard/index.php)\n\nStay safe! \ud83e\udd18",

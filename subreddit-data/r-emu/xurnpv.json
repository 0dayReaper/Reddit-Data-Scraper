Ended up parking on the side along with some other folks and getting a ticket. A few years later, I finished school doing mostly night classes and figured out it was nearly the same amount of money to just pay for parking per hour the few times I had to, and even then most times I didn't have to pay on my way out. EMU is a collection of college shaped buildings designed to funnel cash.",

I'm still deciding if I want to buy one for the winter or not, though. By centralized parking, do you mean the parking that people are paying $200 for??",

This shut down was with little to no warning, no explanation, and no timeline.\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t this shut down happen during the summer months when the parking structure isn\u2019t needed? Why has no work actually been done to the structure if this is such an emergency? There was no urgency coming from this private company until they want their payments from the passes or their parking tickets they try to hand out like candy.\n\nIf you can keep up with the walking I recommend it, screwU parkEMU. Don\u2019t give them anymore money if you can help it.",

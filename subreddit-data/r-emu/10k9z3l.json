Between the administration and parkEMU they are punishing you for being a commuter and the best way to punish you is make sure you pay top dollar for some of the shittiest parking in all of Michigan.",

            "comment": "I was just thinking about this again yesterday, I missed seeing your posts lol. I emailed them back in October asking for any sort of update on the parking garage, and got basically \u201cwe\u2019ll let you know when we have more info\u201d in response. \n\nI don\u2019t believe they\u2019ve still made any official statement about it right? I did see your post back in December about it, but I want to see them admit it themselves. This is getting ridiculous and deserves attention from administration. If they don\u2019t care either, it should be getting attention from local news. That garage has sat empty for the last 5 months AFTER it was under construction for over a year. It\u2019s put a strain on parking availability and yet they still have the gall to charge nearly $200 for it.",

From the hearsay that I\u2019ve picked up EMU and parkEMU are at odds on who is responsible for either repairing the current garage or tear it down and build anew with the student body sitting in limbo while we are paying $200 for a third of the available parking. \n\nWhich brings up a question. What is actually being done with the money that we are sending them? Our garage sits empty, our parking lots are crumbing or unavailable to the students. Are we just paying for the parkEMU attendants to continue to harass EMU students that either can\u2019t or won\u2019t pay for this ridiculous expenditure? \n\nWe know now that through parkEMU\u2019s citation repeal system and their \u201cno refunds\u201d is just a continued effort on the part of this company to take as much money from the EMU student body as possible. \n\nI wrote the Eastern Echo and was only met with silence. It may be up to us, the student body, to write as many news outlets as we can to get this situation addressed.",

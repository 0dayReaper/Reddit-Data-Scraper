I understand paying to park on campus and why paying gives some benefits but I feel like $200 for a pass that is only for 1 semester is kinda crazy.",

Driving around in circles while late for class looking to pry your car between peoples wrecks. I used visitor parking by the science building, always a space but you pay more. The parking is from an outside company and I guess you can take a class at the school in being a total parking-enforcing bastard. They ticketed me TWICE for parking in an empty near the library lot on Sunday within three hours. \ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffb",

When the fuckwads in charge sold out a few years ago, they made parkemu sign an agreement saying they couldn't raise the price of parking more than 5% per year (or something like that). So that's exactly what how much they're gonna raise it by every year without fail until the end of time.",

Expect really bad food (prison style), long lines, and a steep increase in costs to the students. If Aramark wins the contract: 1) http://www.theoaklandpress.com/general-news/20160331/inmates-protest-food-quality-at-second-northern-michigan-prison 2) http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/04/13/michigan-prison-rocks-taco-lawsuit/83005152/ 3) http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/07/13/state-ends-prison-food-contract-aramark/30080211/\nBut they refuse to change their ways with regards to athletics.

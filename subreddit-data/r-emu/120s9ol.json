I know I'm not the only one who's started parking off-campus to avoid giving them any more of my money. Maybe we should put our heads together and compile a list of such parking spots. Share it around.",

If we run away and hide from them with our tails between our legs then we leave behind the people who physically can\u2019t make those 10-20 minute walks to get onto campus and to their building. \n\nEvery chance I get I tell the parkEMU employees what I think of them, their job, and their Texas employers and where they can stick it. I encourage everyone instead of running from the \u201cfight\u201d that needs to happen for the student body to go tell parkEMU how you feel, stop them from taking pictures of student license plates, and take pictures of them when they\u2019re just pissing around to make them look bad. If we are forced into this situation then we are more within our rights to show our displeasure in EMU for selling off the parking rights to a private company that has been harassing us.",

They probably already do have revolving door employment because, again, this is a college town, with college students making up a good chunk of the workforce, college students who are expected to not stay long. Spinning that door is gonna do jack shit. The people in charge DO. NOT. CARE.

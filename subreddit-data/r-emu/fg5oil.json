            "comment": "Yes and no. (But yes overall, I'll explain)\n\nYes, I had a great 8 years there. Part of the marching band , just graduated with a nursing degree. Great program, friendly campus with place to go:the gym, the student center, common areas in the housing. Teachers were mostly all nice and cared about student success. I did have about 2 to 3 that were not very nice. Beautiful campus. The library is really nice to study in, it was my second home. \n\nNo inregards to how they spend there income. They spend way too much money on a football when there are buildings that need renovating and other buildings that have been abandoned since the 80s (I think). Many programs are having budget cuts when they are increasing there funding for football. Cutting  other sports, ect. Some teachers cant print out the papers they need to give in their class due to budgeting. Also in nursing we had to reuse a lot of outdated supplies because not enough money. Didnt help us learn that much. It may not affect you that much.\n\nAlso a no is due to safety. They are trying to implement a lot of stuff but the area is just not very safe. Atleast 1 \"shots fired\" report a semester since I've been there. It has all except 1 occassions been off campus but still. I'd recommend not living at Pennisular Place due to safety concerns, some may argue with me on that. Just my opinion. \n\nIn general, I recommend going there. Many great years, nearly everyone I met were friendly. Made some friends for life there. Good enviroment to learn and grow. Just be careful and just know that some supplies may be outdated. (They did just rebuild a science building from the ground up so maybe things are changing and new supplies will be available, just my experiences)\n\nHoped that help, let me know if you have any questions or concerns about what I mentioned. :)",

I like that most class sizes are around the 30s and most of my professors have been pretty good. The college of business could use a little love though. It doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ve touched it in decades. That\u2019s only been my experience so far though, we\u2019ll see in a few years",

One thing that frustrates me is that EMU is a commuter heavy school so a lot of cool people that I meet in my classes drive an hour or so back home and don't really want to hang around on campus when they don't have to. My classes have all been fine, I enjoy the sizes of them and have only had a couple professors that I didn't like. I managed to get hooked up with an internship through their job fair here, so there's lots of opportunities to get out and gain career expirience. Emu is a really cool school and community, you just have to be aware that it's a commuter school and isn't quite the same as a giant state college, but it's way less expensive!",

            "comment": "Loathed it when I attended a decade ago, though to be fair, I'm not sure I would have fared better at any other school. Probably should have taken more time off and just gone to WCC. I only had one professor I liked who seemed to give a damn, and the university provided no support for a struggling student who had been accepted with honors. I had a couple professors who were rude enough to me that I never went back to their class. At the time, most of what was on the meal plan was fast food, few healthy options. But again, I probably set myself up to fail (undiagnosed depression, anxiety, ADHD) and would have burned out anywhere.\n\nI live in Ypsi now, and I do love it here. The area itself has definitely come a long way since when I was in school. The community has absorbed a lot of the young, artistic folk who have been priced out of Ann Arbor, so it feels pretty vibrant. Though, prices for everything (particularly rent) have been increasing in turn.\n\nEdit: I do think EMU is pretty mismanaged from a financial standpoint. They bring a ton of revenue into the area and don't really seem to do much with it, other than funnel it into failing sports programs (while cancelling others).",

            "comment": "As a sophomore, I currently have mixed feelings on it.\n\nOn one hand, there is a lot to love. The campus is wonderful, as are the people who come here. Everyone here is really friendly and it reminds me of my hometown a bit. The dorms are nice, though not great. Not to mention the location is nice.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't like how EMU is managed, especially lately. The wi-fi has been pretty inconsistent, we don't get as many updates as I'd like when something goes wrong (e.g. every time there's something that sounds like gunshots, people panic on EMU Engage), not to mention how money hungry the school feels at times, which has been reinforced by the [recent announcement that EMU will now be placing four electronic billboards on campus for advertisements.](http://www.easternecho.com/article/2020/03/eastern-michigan-university-agrees-to-a-30-year-contract-to-place-four-electronic-billboards-on-campus) As a side note, I am also frustrated with the food options on campus as someone with celiac, as the commons don't have any on the weekend barring breakfast or GF breads and Smashburger, etc aren't open on the weekend.\n\nOverall, while EMU definitely has some glaring issues, I still like it.",

    "postText": "As we move into a month of having to pay $200 for reduced parking. Let us not forget to thank our friendly EMU administrators for selling out the student body to this private company. \n\nAs the weather starts to become worse rest assure that you will most likely not receive any emails to inform you of why you are forced to pay for the worst parking in all of Michigan schools or when the centralized parking will reopen. No, more than likely you will be sent threatening emails by parkEMU to remind you that you are only allowed to park in in your second class student parking spots. ScrewU parkEMU.",

I'm just wondering if Eastern has as many fun things to do or places to go to on or near campus as Wayne does. Can anyone tell me what Eastern is like?",

I spend my time mostly in Ann Arbor since I work there, so I\u2019m a bit biased to the city. EMU\u2019s campus is pretty dead after 4pm, but there are some fun restaurants to eat at and a lot of shopping towards the AA/Ypsi border. If you\u2019re into a more relaxed setting, this is the place. Living off campus is a bit pricey but not as bad at Ann Arbor. I think campus is beautiful, especially in the fall/spring and it feels pretty safe during the school day! I like it here, and I think you will too if your seeking a more relaxed education setting!!",

Sure, concerts at the Michigan theater (or Pease auditorium for that matter) won\u2019t feature Taylor Swift or other huge names but that\u2019s not my jam anyway.  Detroit is like 30-40 minutes away, though, and being minutes away from the quintessential Midwestern college town that is A2 means there are a ton of similarly situated people to meet and hang out with (ignore the snobby rich ones though, that\u2019s my advice haha). And cool breweries, etc. Renting a place can be a little spendy in some areas but near Eastern\u2019s campus you can do pretty well.",

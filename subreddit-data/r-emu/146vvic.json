It\u2019s a commuter school and I think they\u2019re intentional with their scheduling. It is important to know that it\u2019ll be a bitch and a half trying to find parking though.",

It serves many students (including myself at one point) that don\u2019t necessarily need or want to live on campus. Being near metro Detroit, there\u2019s a lot of students within driving distance. \n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t live on campus. There\u2019s a lot of housing options available on campus, and they\u2019re building more. People refer to us a commuter school because compared to other large schools, we have a high portion of commuter students. The reality is that about 50% live on campus. Compare this to an actual commuter school like U of M Dearborn and we\u2019d far outnumber them.",

The English and teaching courses are extremely flexible so you should be in good hands! Definitely recommend applying and then working with an advisor to set up your schedule. They also offer some remote classes too! And if it doesn\u2019t work with your schedule, it shouldn\u2019t cost you anything. Good luck :)",

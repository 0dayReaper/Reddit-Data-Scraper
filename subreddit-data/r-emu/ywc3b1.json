At my old university if there was a class that filled up during registration that you needed we had a website that you could put the CRN and when a seat opened up it notifies you. So then you knew when to add it during add/drop. Does EMU have something similar to this?",

If there\u2019s an opening, it goes by a first come first served basis on who was the first to join the waitlist. I believe you\u2019ll get an email if there\u2019s an opening and you\u2019re able to enter the class",

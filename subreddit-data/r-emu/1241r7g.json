    "postText": "I'm looking for some suggestions , advice or thoughts on a group project problems. \n\nI had a group project to do with two other people. We had less than a week to put it together, a 3 to 4 page paper and up to 50 minutes of oral presentation. When the assignment was given and assigned, we had less than 6 days to complete the presentation and paper. We only had one class after the project was assigned to bring up issues to the professor. One of the group members was assigned after the project groups had already formed. Neither one of the group members have good attendance, one was not there on Thursday when the project was assigned, the second was not there the Tuesday(day before the due date). Due to scheduling conflicts, we were only able to get together on one day, which was when the paper was due at Midnight. Before our meeting to write the paper, during this time we had communicated via text. My other group members did not want fully cover all the points in the assignment group project the professor had clearly stated in the  syllabus. I did mention we need to cover these topics and they brushed it off. After we finished up at the library on Wednesday night, one of my group members said they were going to turn in the paper. I didn't offer because I had already reserved library group study rooms and I was completing the PowerPoint slides for the project. Well the group member ended up turning in the paper late. We ended up getting a C on the group project, it dropped my  A to a B.  I really wanted to get an A in this class, to apply to scholarships, and now I will not be able to apply to certain scholarships, due to my group partners incompetence. I had two group partners who were not as motivated/irresponsible to earn a good grade on this project. I have never have worked on a project like this with such unmotivated/,irresponsible group members. I just found out today, that the paper was turned in late, from a text message. Side note other groups that picked their topics depending on the date have up to 5 weeks to complete the assignment. It would be a better policy to give each group the same amount of time, if the last group had 6 weeks to prepare, versus the first group only had 4 days, second group had 6 days. Students do have other courses and assignments have been on the calendar for weeks. \nThe assignment was not a fair distribution of time to complete the project. In the past most of my other professors give more than enough time for group projects to be completed. Not this course/professor. Such a case of  Tragedy of the Commons.\n\n Is this what I have to look forward to, when working on group projects at EMU with other students? \n\nLearned incompetence has not skipped generations, even with gen Z.",

It\u2019s too late to do anything now, but you should\u2019ve brought it up to the professor earlier. They may have been willing to work something out with you. Professors know there\u2019s always going to be dead weights in some groups.\n\nThe best and only way to deal with them is to be annoying. Ask them what\u2019s the best time to meet in person/virtual immediately after being placed into the group with them. Get on them early into the project and keep up constant communication. If they don\u2019t respond at all or aren\u2019t fulfilling their promises, take it to the professor. It\u2019s your only safeguard from winding up in this position",

Sit down with the professor and explain all this to them, and they MAYBE be nice (if they feel like it) and give you some extra credit or something to work on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, this is just a life skill, yes, it sucks, but you need to learn to work with people who may not want to work with you, and you need to learn to use your soft influence to get people to at least partially come around. This is just a part of life that will never go away.",

They did not know how to formally format a paper or how to present a topic to class. Both of them have already completed COMM 124. \n\nOne of the partners wanted to be my partner specifically because he said to me\"you know so much about the topics we cover in class, and hopefully get good grade\", which is code for you to do all the work for me and get your grade too for doing the least amount of work on the project.",

            "comment": "first and foremost, i just want to empathize with you about your grade being lowered because of others. it really sucks when everyone in your group is not as invested in their grades as you. \n\nas u/knagy17 said, this should\u2019ve been brought up to the professor before the due date. i know you had little time to work with\u2026for the future though, definitely nip any group issues in the bud ASAP. always think of alternatives that could work for everyone even if it means being annoying. they can\u2019t meet irl? cool, everyone can hop on zoom and turn their cam off if they want. can\u2019t do zoom or facetime/similar application? alright, everyone just joins the google doc/slide/whatever. once you have reached and exhausted all possible options to get your group members to take the assignment seriously, it\u2019s worth bringing up to the professor. you don\u2019t have to get too accusatory either, just be sure to state the facts (\u201cmy group has a hard time getting started on/finishing up this project, do you have any more suggestions? i\u2019ve tried x, y, z to no avail and i\u2019d like your input\u201d). \n\nas an EMU alumna myself i know many of the professors are not fans of students asking for extra credit. however, if you can demonstrate to your instructor that you were passionate about getting a good grade on this project (without going overboard or being pushy about it, of course) they may let you turn in your version of the paper component for extra points or even let you do an additional 5pt assignment. i would never approach a meeting with a professor expecting them to agree to this though -  as i\u2019m sure you know they often do not offer EC especially in the form of an extra assignment without extending everyone that opportunity.",

It was like hearding cats just to get a set time,  to work on the project together.  Why were low achievers  placed in my group, just to bring my grade down? I would have rather worked on the project by myself, instead of a group project with low ambition students.  Its definitely not like that in sports such as football or anyother team sport, just looking out for me, theirs no I or me in team. Its a selfish way of thinking.",

Tough love here for ya.\n\nShould have grown up, stayed after class to talk to the professor after that last class before the project was due. Don't throw anyone under the bus because managers, bosses and especially teachers hate that. Tell them that you're trying to schedule meetings to get together but your group can't figure out more than one time and that is the night before the project is due. You're not throwing anyone under the bus but you are being the young adult and going to your teacher (manager / boss in the real world) and asking them for ways you can solve the issue you are having.\n\nYou're going to have to work with plenty of those kinds of people in your lifetime. Most companies base their bonuses on how much the company makes. There are people who do the bare minimum and they get the same bonus as you. Or you're on a small team and someone messes up, the whole team gets in trouble. It's how the world works.",

When had only 6 days notice, one class meeting in-between from when the project was assigned,  to get together and complete the project. The course meets on Tuesday AM, and Thursday AM, the other group members decided after our Tue class the only time they could meet up was on Wednesday. The professor not have office hours available before the Thursday class. The men in the group kept giving scheduling conflicts, they waited until Wednesday to be available to complete the group project. Which I think they did that on purpose, hoping I would do it all for them, and not have put in the time for this assignment. We didn't even get all together until the day before we were supposed to present to the class, 8 hours before the paper was due to the professor. Its irresponsible behavior, and I'm old enough to know that it was irresponsible of them, and not cool. \n\nDepending on the day the paper/presentation is due, the other groups have up to 5 weeks to put together the project. \n\nA work situation is different, for many reasons, I understand that. I'm not a young 20something, like my male group members.",

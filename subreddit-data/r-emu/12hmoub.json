I already signed up for the class, but I\u2019m not sure who my professor is yet. I am also not good at math, so it\u2019s a little nerve wrecking for me. I\u2019ve also heard really iffy things about the accounting classes here, so if anyone could give me feedback, it would be great!",

If you can add subtract multiply divide you\u2019ll be fine.  240 is financial accounting. It\u2019s pretty cool, you\u2019ll learn how to read a balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, learn debits and credits, the basic accounting formula (a=l+e) cash basis vs accrual, journal entries, and more.  \n\nIf you struggle with any topic, look up the YouTube channel \u201caccounting stuff\u201d all the topics taught in 240 are super basic and widely covered in YouTube tutorials.  \n\nBut yea have fun, I enjoy it and like learning how businesses function. Some kids struggle really bad because they don\u2019t get basic concepts, that\u2019s where you get the \u201caccounting is hard\u201d horror stories.  \n\nIf you need any other help I\u2019m a senior accounting major just message me\n\nBut really don\u2019t worry, the class is pretty basic. If you show me the syllabus with what exact topics are covered, I could get you prolly like 5-10 YouTube videos that you could watch and literally pass the entire class.  \n\nWhat is your major? Accounting or some other business?",

The math aspect is not difficult at all. It\u2019s mostly remembering ideas from the reading.I have skipped assignments and still have a high B+",

Parking isn\u2019t enforced after 6pm iirc. Just use meters if  if you have 1 class regardless of which building I had to go to. Saved more money instead of paying park emu. The other thing is just walk 30min to class and not pay anything.  I hate to break it to you, even before park emu, prices always went up.\n\nEdit:  Named the wrong building",

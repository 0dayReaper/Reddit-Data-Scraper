    "postText": "Im currently 22 and received a one year certificate in audio engineering but am interested in going back to college and am interested in a variety of majors mainly education. My main questions would be how accepting would emu classes be of someone who is older than the rest of the class and how accessible is the college as a commuter school for someone who lives in Brighton.",

            "comment": "About 22% of the student body for undergraduate students is between the ages of 22-24 and almost 15% of the undergraduate student body is between the ages of 25-29, so you will fit in just fine here. I have noticed that there are a lot of older students on campus as undergraduates and it's awesome to see. As far as commuting, EMU is through and through a commuter school.

            "comment": "Consider WCC as well, that's generally more economical and a pretty common route going back to school. But as far as EMU goes as long as they get your money, the school will be thrilled. I can't see you being perceived or treated any differently, besides maybe from 18 year olds - but who gives a shit what 18 year olds think?\n\nNot to mention you're only 22. I'm 33 and considering going back for a different major. I believe my mom went back to school before starting her career in her late 30's. People do it all the time. Best of luck!",

Commuting from Brighton makes that easier on you than it is on the people commuting from halfway up the Thumb, though.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, 2nd year nursing student here. I received an email about being placed on a warning status via SAP due to having to many credit hours?? I have to fill out an undergrad 23-24 Maximum credit hours of eligibility (MCE) appeal? I\u2019m just confused as to why I have to? If we need a minimum of 120 credit hours and I\u2019m at 118 hours why am I being placed on a warning status? For context I was dual enrolled throughout high school (about 50 hours worth) and I\u2019ve changed majors 2 times before sticking with nursing, and I hate to admit but I\u2019ve not passed two courses prior to switching to nursing. I\u2019m just really nervous as I\u2019ve never had this happen before and I feel like no one is explaining why this is happening to me at the financial aid office. Has anyone had this happen before? Thanks guys!",

I believe if it\u2019s going to be over 150% before you earn your degree you have to appeal.\n\nhttps://www.emich.edu/finaid/understanding/academic-process/index.php",

When I appeal, and I\u2019m sorry I just don\u2019t know what to say, should I simply just say that I switched majors and was dual enrolled? I am in the nursing program and have a year left. I\u2019m done changing my mind lol!! And thank you for responding, this makes me feel better:)",

    "postText": "i used an ai to write an OUTLINE of an essay (not the whole essay, im not an idiot) and it got flagged and the investigation decided it counts as significant academic dishonesty. this is my first violation, will it show up on my transcript or will my poor grade be the only thing shown for the first violation.\n\nedit: im not sure how they knew it was outlined with ai, perhaps theres a specific formatting thing that ai always does and a detector picked it up. regardless, i am aware any use of outside materials counts as AD and i was not planning on pleading my case because i did at least partially produce my end product using ai tools. just curious of the repercussions beyond a 0 on the assignment/failing the class.",

Furthermore, they really do help you organize your thoughts and make for an easy paper writing experience. \n\nI probably need not tell you that it clearly would of been less work and headache to had done both assignments w/o plagiarizing. Life moves on though, keep your head up. We all get the same diploma in the end, but everyone\u2019s has their own story attached.",

I just graduated in 2021, so it took me roughly 6 -7 years to get my bachelors. I was a philosophy major, so perhaps the professor was one I know. They really are all mostly so sweet and understanding. I learnt that communication is key when it comes to professors, they were all in our shoes at some point.",

While I do indeed feel smarter, I drive a fuckin semi now. Could of easily done that without a degree. \n\nSome tips that I wish I would of known earlier on though. 1. Talk to people in your class and get their number. Class group chats are fun af. This was what made the biggest improvement for me. Both academically and socially. 2. Talk to your professors, force small talk. Go visit during office hours and just say hi. Both of those tips will make class feel like a much more welcoming place. 3. Doing the work sucks! But not as much as it does feeling the guilt of withdrawing or failing. 4. Slow and steady wins the race, can\u2019t handle 4 classes at once? Then don\u2019t sign up for that many. \n\nFeel free to dm if you want. I\u2019m always willing to lend a hand or social if you want. I live outside of saline, my wife, sister and her gf like to go out if you ever want to go out. We\u2019re always looking for something to do (bowling, top golf, bar, movies, strip club).",

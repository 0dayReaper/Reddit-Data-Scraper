    "postText": "Ever since they switched to a new company, the paylot gates have been breaking down and trapping people in the lots causing them to rack up charges. Of course they don't have a reimbursement policy for that! No, we, broke-ass students have to pay for *their* incompetence. I wouldn't mind so much if there was still a free lot, but no, they started charging an arm and a leg for that too. I already pay thousands to go here. I'd rather bike through the rain and snow than give these fuckers another penny.",

I've been happily walking up to half an hour to avoid paying those stupid fees. There are multiple parks near campus where parking is 100% free year round. All you gotta do is be willing to use your legs a little. \n\nIt's free, you get some exercise, and  ParkEMU doesn't get to profit off of you.",

It\u2019s not like I hate walking. I just don\u2019t have the extra 20 minutes to waste daily. It\u2019s bad enough I\u2019m already wasting an extra hour a day with the added commute because offering classes at a convenient time is, apparently, not possible. \n\nMost of the time, after you are past your gen ed classes, there is literally one class offered per YEAR of the classes needed. So, it\u2019s not even like you get a choice to try and schedule things in a way that you aren\u2019t constantly rushing from one thing to another. \n\nNot to mention, walking outside for any additional time in the middle of winter at sub-zero temps isn\u2019t really my idea of a good time.",

I would like to be able to choose what I spend that extra almost hour a day (15 min to find a parking spot + 15 min walk to class + 15 min walk back to my car). If I had all the extra time in the world, I\u2019d park in town for free and walk.",

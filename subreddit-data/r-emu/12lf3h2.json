I\u2019d definitely say from my time in Munson that the interior is quite bland, so bring lots of stuff decorate.  Great location though.",

Also, bring apple cider vinegar or something to help with fruit flies. The building is old, and all the drains are connected, so even if you don\u2019t leave fruit or food out, you\u2019re still going to get them from other units.",

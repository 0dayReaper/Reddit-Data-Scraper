    "postText": "Another week of the semester down and the parking structure is still out with no communication thanks to the management of this terrible private company. Just today the parkEMU van was doing circles scanning the same three rows of cars for 30 minutes trying to find students to punish for not paying their outrageous prices with this crappy service. Thank you EMU administration for selling the students out.",

The lot across from Sill is impossible to park in and the ($2.00 a fucking hour...with no prorated rates for partial hours) is never more than half full. And now, since the parking garage closed, it's even worse. \n\nThey need to make the pay lot smaller. There's so much pay parking and almost no commuter parking. I'm seriously considering finding out how much a room in that house on Forrest is, just so I have a guaranteed parking spot. \n\nI get to the school 15-20 mins early and still end up being late because I can't park. It's rage inducing.",

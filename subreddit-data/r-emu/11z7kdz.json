Apparently there have been people saying racist shit and they\u2019re requiring all 300+ students in the hall to go to some meeting about being open minded next Friday. I already have plans that day, but it sounds like if I don\u2019t do it, I\u2019m getting in trouble and have to have a conversation with the complex director. Are the RAs allowed to force stuff like that?",

You can upload large files like textbooks and it will pull out the most relevant parts of the file and give it to ChatGPT to answer your question. You can share datasets you create and add editors to your datasets.\r  \n\r  \nThis tool lets you do things like create study guides from a syllabus, answer a specific question from homework or a textbook, or write papers based on specific guidelines.\r  \n\r  \nWhen you log in with Google you get 100 credits for free, which is enough for quite a few uploads and questions.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.dreamcatcherai.org",

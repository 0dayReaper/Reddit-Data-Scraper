            "comment": "Nice video! Rynearson could definitely stand some upgrades on the inside, but on the outside I think it looks nice. Since this video was taken, a new structure was built in the north end zone called the student athlete performance center. It\u2019s much larger and more modern looking than the old building, and it helps to tie the stadium together and make it look less horseshoe shaped. It\u2019s also brought a much needed large scoreboard. \n\nAs an avid football fan, I\u2019m really glad to see the improvements that have been made. EMU and the USFL are in talks to potentially host the Michigan USFL team this spring. That could bring money for further upgrades, which would be really nice. I don\u2019t expect it anytime soon, but removing the track and bringing the stands in is at the top of my list. Would really up the experience and make the stadium look nicer. Plus, track and field would have their own proper structure for which we\u2019ve actually done historically well in.",

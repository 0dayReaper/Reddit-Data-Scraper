Are there any hint/tips that make life easier when you are heading into your first year on campus? \n\nBio: I am a electrical engineering major(planned ee major). That is transferring in the fall. I currently commute to the local community college. \n\nThanks in advance for any help that can be provided!",

EE classes should still be at the north end of Jobst - NW part of campus by the 'stadium'.",

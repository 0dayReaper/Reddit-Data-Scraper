Might as well revisit it.\n\nSo on reddit I'm browniebiznatch (don't judge me on the name I wasn't exactly sober when I made it and got a crap ton of karma) but IRL I'm Deepak Sabharwal. I'm a biology major meaning I spend my life at Olin. I want to go into medicine but we'll see if I actually get in haha.\n\nWhat about the rest of you?",

If they are anything like some of the people I have worked with then they have been doing their jobs longer than you have even been alive; they may do things the old way, but trust me when I say that they know what they are doing. Offer suggestions/ideas where appropriate, but until you get the hang of things just shut up and take it in.\n\nAlso, be careful with technology, for smaller places you may become the de facto IT person just because of your age.",

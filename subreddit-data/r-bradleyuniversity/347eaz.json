I would like to see more awareness of this subreddit and making sure the word gets out about this place. \n\nBeing on reddit, there is nothing more that most of us like than spewing our opinions so lets have it. What are some ways that we can make this sub a better place? How can we raise awareness about this sub? Lets get some discussion going about this place. \n\nI realize that the summer is right around the corner and finals are approaching. If we could get signs up in UHall especially during orientation it would be a great way for freshmen to start to get a taste of campus. I have scrolled through and seen a lot of popular posts about this very such thing. Thoughts? Comments?",

            "comment": "One way could be to increase posts, maybe about stuff going on around campus. A source that comes to mind is the Student Activity Office (SAO) and the Activities Council of BU (ACBU) - if there is something to do on campus, these are (probably) the people behind it. This could also offer the many student groups a place to promote their group. If postings are going up, the SAO are the people that 'approve' fliers, but those went in non-dorm locations...dorms might need something through Res Life/housing. For something during orientation you may need to get in touch with the orientation office. Some other options could include info from the athletics department, recreation center, various education departments, maybe even the menus from the dining halls.\n\nReddit can be a very useful tool and community, especially for new students.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm currently a student from a different university (UIUC) home for break. I have a couple friends that currently attend Bradley and wanted to go to class with them for like a day or so just to see what the college is like. I was wondering what the policies for this kind of stuff is like and if I can get away with this for a day. It's not like purposely trying to sit in on a lecture for free, I just kinda wanna hang out with some friends at the college I usually don't see while they're at school. This is usually allowed in public university, but since Bradley is private I'm not sure if the rules are different.",

            "comment": "Depends on the class tbh. If it's a small sized class that only certain majors are allowed into the professor will def notice and kick you out as they take attendance. If it's a big class like CIV tho with a bunch of people you could def do it. Just don't disrupt the class cause plenty of people want to pay attention and learn and a disturbance will get you kicked out.",

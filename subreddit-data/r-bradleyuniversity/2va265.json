    "postText": "Hi everybody.\n\nAs the title suggests, I am a senior in high-school that just got accepted into Bradley's Interactive Media program. I'm from Highland park, and Bradley is my number one school, so I am very grateful to have been accepted.\n\nAlthough my worries about admission are over, my next concern is ahead, and that is pricing. Coming from a not-so-well-off family, Bradley's tuition costs are fairly daunting, especially with the heavy burdens school loans carry with them.\n\nOf course, I have applied to FAFSA and all that. My estimates will likely come in the following months, but I'm jumping the gun on this topic.\n\nWould you say Bradley's tuition price was worth your education/experience? Does Bradley offer much in the ways of financial assistance? And has anybody looked to things like military (kind of specific, I know) to help cover the cost (and if so, how was it)?\n\nI'd greatly appreciate answers to any sort of question relating to this topic, as cost is the only factor potentially holding me back from attending.",

            "comment": "Hello, I'm a freshman Finance major here. \n\nI'm wondering did Bradley give you a scholarship? Since they have varying degrees that they do hand out. Also one thing I did to squeeze out some more money is I emailed my counselor I played the schools off eachother like, \"Hey I would love to go to Bradley but currently Elmhurst is giving me a slightly larger scholarship.\" and see what they say. Look up other Scholarships such as the Bradley [Fellows](http://www.bradley.edu/campuslife/studentleadership/leadership/fellows/).\n\nAlso community college isn't a bad option because it is considerably cheaper and might possibly become free within the the next few years. Then you could transfer here, which I know multiple people who have and will be doing that. \n\nOne Final thing is jobs on campus through workstudy I believe get precedent over regular applicants. Which would also help cover costs. \n\nIf you have any other questions please don't hesitate to ask me!\n\nEdit: Also noticed that you said you wanted what I think about my education here! Personally I love it I had only one class that was a lecture and it was meant to be that way. The professors all have office hours to get help with if you're struggling in class. There are constant internship opportunities as we have two fairs each year for them and other companies have private workshops to recruit you(atleast for the college of business). \n\nOne last thing I was looking at jobs on campus and there were ALOT of jobs that dealt with graphic design (which I can't do) so that is another option.

I'll likely do an edit when I get it.\n\nWork study wouldn't seem too bad, especially if it can help me cover some of the cost. I'll highly consider it.\n\nAlthough community is a highly economical choice (and likely the only other choice for me), it creates another hassle for me in my situation. I'd need to get a car to drive there, and I'd need to get a full-time job to cover that (which isn't so bad), but the main problem is that my parents were looking to move next year. It's a sticky situation, but if nothing else is possible I'm sure community will be available to me.\n\nI'm glad to hear you're enjoying your time there! When I came to visit, Bradley seemed like it was genuinely great when it came to education and experience. That only boosts my hopes up more.\n\nIf I have any questions that pop up, would you mind if I PM'd you? I wouldn't want to intrude, but the help would be awesomely appreciated.",

            "comment": "Hey, I'm a senior business major here at Bradley. After years of being here I've learned a lot. First and foremost realize you are making a huge commitment. I can tell you from experience, transferring is near impossible for most after their first year. Next you have to understand the dynamic you're getting into. Most students here are from the area or Chicago so be prepared to deal with this demographic of people. Next it is a very small school, which has many cons for me but pros for other. We have no school spirit in my opinion because of size and the lack of a football program. This means you don't go out with friends every weekend to a game, which depending on who you are could play a huge role. This size also means you will be mingling generally with the same group of people often, not saying you can't branch out but it's not as easy as other larger school. We have a large Greek community, percentage wise, which is a great opportunity to check out even if you don't want to join an organization, just to meet people. That's a quick run down on the social life and personal development you'll get here. As for the academic it once again has it's pros and cons. Pros as said before is you get very small class sizes with a lot of interaction. But what comes with that is very small departments that may or may not teach in your style of learning or give you the expertise you're looking for in your related field. As for the value for your money, it's debatable. Since its a small private college in the Midwest it's going to be expected that people outside the area that see it on an application will scoff it off as a no name school. But if you plan on staying in the immediate area right out of college it's great value. Our career advising department gives you any and all tool necessary to find what you're looking for and help you get there. If you're comparing it to some place like u of I you're going to be paying about the same amount of money. Just understand that value isn't always academic like a lot of people claim it to be, even though schooling is obviously of utmost importance. If you have any other questions you can feel free to pm me with anything you have.",

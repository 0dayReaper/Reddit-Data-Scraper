Out of 20 students, everyone either got into their graduate of choice, med school, or an industry job within 6 months of graduating. My class had a recent meetup, and we're doing pretty well! \n\nSomething you'll realize when going to college in general is that the material you'll learn will be the same wherever you go, but the professors are what make the subject matter interesting and easily understood. I'd say 80-90% of the professors are approachable, and very easy to take advantage of their office hours. On top of that, if you're looking to get into research it's generally really easy to shadow someone your sophomore year and be independent by junior/senior year. All you have to do is ask around for who's accepting students!\n\nThe first 2 years, you'll basically be taking a bunch of classes with chemistry majors. Junior year is where it splits and you get the unique biochem courses.",

Bradley's Chemistry and Biology departments offer strong opportunities for undergraduate research and getting facetime with professors who genuinely want to help you succeed. \n\nIn my opinion, those two factors are the two most important things a school can provide to produce a successful undergraduate. \n\nWrite a more detailed post if you want more detailed answers. Worth it is often relative to something else.",

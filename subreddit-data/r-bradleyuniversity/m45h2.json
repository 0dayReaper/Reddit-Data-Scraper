    "postText": "So we have 6 subscribers now. Let's see what we all we have in common! I'll go first.\n\n\nMy name is Dan Thompson, I'm a junior communications major specializing in electronic media. Haha if you don't know it means I do a lot of video and audio capturing and editing. I'm doing work for midstate magazine this semester, so if you see someone around campus with a big ole camera it could be me!\n\nI also have a minor in English - Creative Writing, and next semester I'll be adding another minor in Sociology.\nI guess what I want out of these sort of degrees is to be able to write/film/produce/edit and do everything for film. I love film. Some of my favorite movies and shows are Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire, Skins(UK)... the list goes on.\n\nOther hobbies include, when I have the time, video games (Blazblue, League of Legends), music (Ratatat, Pretty Lights, Big Gigantic), and weekend fun stuff.\n\n**Edit** Forgot to mention this (derp) I'm also organizing the Youth for Ron Paul chapter on campus, so if anyone is interested in that you gotta get at me!\n\nYour turn",

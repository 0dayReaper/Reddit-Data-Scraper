    "postText": "I'm a student at Purdue right now and I'm finding it's impossible to do engineering here. I'm planning on transferring to Bradley for a better academic experience but I'm concerned about the social aspect of Bradley. Purdue's a big 10 school, and while it is a nerd school, the campus always feels very alive, with friendly people all around. My dorm here is also very tight knit and people are always going in and out of neighboring rooms. How is the social aspect at Bradley within the dorms and in general?",

            "comment": "I was an RA at Bradley for a few years, and as such saw a lot of different social types of floors. Some were quieter, especially singles dorms (no roommates) or floors with more upper classmen typically deeper in studies or spending their time out of the dorm. But honestly most were pretty lively. Not that the whole floor got along, but often 4-5 groups that would do meals, activities, parties etc together. \n\nI still keep in touch with a few of those groups now, almost 15 years later. I looked at and toured Purdue as well, but chose Bradley because it seemed more intimate. I think you can make great friends anywhere, but Bradley felt more tight knit as you saw the same people around often. Best of luck in your choices!",

The Fray recently released their new album Helios with the hit single [\"Love Don't Die\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WptxUWvrINQ&amp;feature=kp). You can also visit The Fray's wesite [here](http://www.thefray.com). \n\nI'm really interested to hear what everyone has to say about the Spring concert, good or bad. So let's get a good discussion thread going!",

That was dope. How about you bring someone who has a wider appeal, good music, and students won't feel indifferent towards going?\n\nOh, an you're charging $15 too, Bradley? Don't you have a bank account built-up from the past 2-3 fall concerts that were skipped and the sub-par spring concerts?\n\nCome on.",

I'll give them a break since Ke$ha canceled short notice but I still don't know if I would pay $15 to see a band/artist I have no interest in.",

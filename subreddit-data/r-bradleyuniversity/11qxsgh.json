    "postText": "I am doing a project regarding House Bill 3865. This bill would prohibit the sell and distribution of polystyrene (styrofoam) food service containers. I am conducting a survey to understand the publics opinion and whether they disapprove or approve of the bill. I will be presenting the results to legislators at Springfield. Please take 5 minutes of your time to help me out in this school project. Additionally, if you or anyone you know is a business owner please complete the survey as we need more responses from business owners.\n\n[https://forms.gle/MZurz8oXJVGK9v1Z6](https://forms.gle/MZurz8oXJVGK9v1Z6)",

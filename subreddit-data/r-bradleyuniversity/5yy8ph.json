You can check out my 4 currently available games at https://indiegage.itch.io (link probably won't work since I'm on mobile and don't feel like figuring out the markup). You can support me on patreon too if ya want. www.patreon.com/indiegage . Anyways, I'm excited to see that we have this community available and I'll try too keep up on it if I can.\n\nEdit: it seems that baconreader is smart and these link will work",

In the future I will make a wiki linking to your website, but I need you to make the post in the subreddit first. Include as much personal information as possible. Link FB, Patreon and anything else you want. Just try to make the post as interesting as possible and hopefully you can drive some traffic your way.",

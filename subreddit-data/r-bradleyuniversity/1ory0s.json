    "postText": "I have enabled user flair for this subreddit.  You can now put something like your major and graduation year next to your username.  Click on edit next to your username on the right side.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs you can see title tags have been implemented.  The benefit of this is that all future posts will automatically be assigned link flair which makes it easy to search for a certain kind of post.\n\nHere is an explanation of when it is relevant to use title tags:\n\n* Use **[Friends]** including the brackets in the title to show that you are interested in finding friends, roommates, missed connections,...\n\n* Use **[Announcement]** including the brackets in the title to show that this post is for announcing something happening on campus.\n\n* Use **[Serious]** including the brackets in the title for posts seeking a serious answer.\n\n* ~~Use **[Discussion]** including the brackets in the title for posts seeking a discussion about a topic.~~\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have already posted a few with the title tags.\n\nThe categories section on the sidebar allows you to see all the posts for a certain category/Title Tag.  Check it out!\n\nLet me know if there is anything you would like changed or any comments you may have.\n\n**EDIT:**  Removed discussion tag",

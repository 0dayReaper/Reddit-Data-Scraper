Big enough that you don\u2019t know everyone, but small enough that you see people you know walking around campus. Most all of my classmates had no issues finding jobs and Bradley really works hard to bring internship and full time opportunities to the students. I work with a few other Bradley engineers and my company actively recruits from campus.",

I think the civil engineering department is top-notch at Bradley especially with now being able to utilize the new building spaces. The career fair always has tons of companies as well for civil engineers to par with Mechanical engineering, which I think is more student dominant at Bradley. I would try to figure out the possible projects you will get as a senior to see if they interest you. A lot of the early on teachers that I took for static and dynamics are from the middle-east so they have some accent, but they are very helpful and are good at what they do.",

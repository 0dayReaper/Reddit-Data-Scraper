    "postText": "I'm a senior in high school this year, so like most of my peers I'm deciding on a college. I visited Bradley in October and loved it! However, I have since started second guessing myself. I like that it is a smaller school yet offers many majors, and the campus is beautiful, but I'm not sure that I will fit in there. I know a large part of the school participates in Greek life, and I don't think that is for me. I have already been accepted as a health science major and received the dean's scholarship. \nI just want to know what your favorite parts of Bradley are (other than small class sizes) as well as any aspects that you think are not mentioned enough by the college (good or bad).

I transferred in from U of I and I'm really happy I did. The science program here is just so much more oriented towards the students and the research opportunities are great. I'm really happy with my choice to go here.",

            "comment": "I went there because I liked it being a smaller school. I got to visit a few friends at some bigger schools (University of Illinois - both Urbana-Champaign and Chicago) and I was very thankful that I didn't have to drive or take buses to reach other classes, I was (almost) never a faceless individual in a crowd of students, it wasn't too hard to find people that shared my interests, and there was usually something to do.\n\nIt has been a little while since I have been to campus, so some of it is a little more put together than the last time I was there - most of the far west side of campus has been vastly improved in the last few years (look at the google map satellite image).\n\nAs for greek life, I didn't participate and only about a third of undergrads take part. It never really seemed to cause any issues - maybe some scheduling conflicts for a group project or something and the occasional having to deal with some stereotypical \"frat boys,\" but they provided some interesting activities and opportunities. If you don't want to participate, you don't have to, there is plenty of other stuff to do - take a look at the [Student Activity Office](http://www.bradley.edu/campuslife/sao/), which sort of handles the various student groups. When I was there there was a Dungeons and Dragons group, there was a 4-sqaure group, there were a lot of groups. That office is also responsible for events on campus, like concerts, comedians, movies, etc - most of which was free, but they would occasionally have a 'bigger' show which would be extra cheap for student. Being a smaller school can be a disadvantage, but it can also mean more opportunities and more intimate experiences.\n\nI can't overstate the small class size issue - towards the end of my time there I had a couple of classes that were under 5 people which was a bit of a surreal experience; there were one or two general classes (Theater appreciation?) that were more heavily populated. There were some fantastic people (my wife would be mad if I didn't point this out) and some people that weren't so great. There were some great times and some not so good. But after it all (hindsight being 20/20), I don't really think I could have gone anywhere else and been happy.\n\nA big concern could be the price - on one hand I am going to be in debt for a while, but on the other I have a pretty good job because of BU so it isn't too much of a concern. The food on campus wasn't always the greatest, but thankfully there was Avantis (italian restaurant across the street from campus, offers some decent food at a decent price. I suggest checking out the gondola sandwich). A problem I noticed the last time I was there was that the grocery store in the shopping center across the street has closed, which really sucks for those less mobile than others.\n\nI think that is enough of a rant for one evening.",

The other school I'm looking at is UIUC but I'm pretty positive it's too big for my liking-- I just have a lot of family who went there and they're definitely pressuring me to attend as well. I'm from a smaller town and a school where everyone knows everyone, so Bradley would for sure be more of what I'm used to. \n\nAlso I tried Avanti's before my visit and I was kind of disappointed. ",

For a nicer meal (and it has gotten nice since I was a student) there is One World, which is across the street from Avanti's.",

One of the biggest thing I have to say is that being here I have made some of the best friends I've ever had in my life. At first the prospect of going to a new school made me nervous, having been in the same school district my entire life and being in school with the same people my entire elementary to high school career, having to be with an entirely new group of people was daunting. During orientation you will definitely meet a lot of new people and make a few friends, and hopefully find a roommate if you plan on staying in a dorm. On that topic try and find a roommate at orientation as opposed to going the random route, and don't be afraid to ask someone to be your roommate. And then theres Welcome Week! Where you get thrown into a bunch of social events and they give you free food and meet new people.\n\nDeciding to go greek is a big choice but I know plenty of people(myself included) who are independent. It really isn't a big deal if you are or not. It just isn't for some people and there isn't a problem with it if it's not your thing. My roommate is in a fraternity and it doesn't sound like anything special other than getting to know a few new people.",

It's generally considered as one of the best schools in the Midwest.\n\nAlso: Avanti's is better when you go during busy hours. Otherwise they slack a bit.

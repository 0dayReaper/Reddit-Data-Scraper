I took a Kaplan class at Illinois Wesleyan last semester and they had flyers advertising their Reddit page all over the place. Let's do the same thing!\n\nSend us your designs for flyers and we'll have a contest to see which one the subreddit likes! The winner will get 1 month of Reddit gold (paid for by yours truly). The contest will end on Halloween so get your submissions in and win **1 Month of Reddit Gold**!\n\n-browniebiznatch",

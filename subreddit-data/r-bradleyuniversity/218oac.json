    "postText": "In order to prepare for the upcoming sidebar image contest, I wanted to see some of the best pictures or memes that our readers have. This contest will not have a prize (other than bragging rights of course) but that doesn't mean the sidebar contest won't as the details are still being decided. A couple rules though:\n\n1. **Keep it clean** - Nothing that could hurt Bradley's reputation. This is up to mod discretion.\n2. **Make it about Bradley** - Other pictures are cool but don't make much sense since this is Bradley's subreddit...\n3. **Be nice to each other**\n\nThe winner of the bragging rights will be announced towards the end of the week. Pictures will be judged based on the number of upvotes and overall \"funniness\". If a prize is found for this contest I will be sure to update this thread so everyone knows. Good luck and I look forward to seeing some funny stuff later.\n\nCONTEST CLOSED",

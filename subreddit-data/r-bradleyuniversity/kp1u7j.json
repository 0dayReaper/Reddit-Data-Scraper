    "postText": "Hello everybody. I am a current freshman that goes to Iowa State University. I come from the Chicago suburbs.\n\nA little bit of background. I decided to go to Iowa State since it was a big school and I thought that I would get a really good opportunity to branch out there, despite the covid situation. I am currently a chemical engineering major, but it is very likely that I will be changing my major. \n\nAt first I thought that Iowa State was a good school, but after more time passed, I realized that it is not a good school. People are not very friendly and it has been extremely difficult to branch out and make friends. People in my residence hall are not courteous of the other students on the floor. Students drink themselves to death and party like no tomorrow on the weekends. I expected there to be a party scene, but nothing to this extent. Overall, I feel no connection to the students or people at Iowa State.\n\nI have thought about coming to Bradley since it is a mid-sized university. If anybody can tell me what it is like; what is the party culture/scene? How are the academics, particularly in the engineering field? How are the students, friendly?\n\nAny feedback is appreciated.",

Brand new multi-million dollar business and engineering building so the school really cares about the program.\n\nParty scene is pretty decent. Lots of greek life, but even if that isn\u2019t your scene you can definitely make friends pretty easily and have a good time.",

There is definitely a lot of opportunity to not drink and join a club or something of that sort, but I\u2019d say half the student body still heavily drinks on the weekends.",

I made friends with the guy in the dorm across from me because I kept running into him at the dining halls, so he invited me into his room one Saturday night with like 15 other people that were all drinking, vaping, etc. I was like nope after that.\n\nI tried joining some clubs, but I either didn't like the clubs I joined or they never responded to my emails where I requested info about the club lol.\n\nIdk if it's the party/drinking culture that I don't like or the people. I kinda figured Bradley would be better since it's a much smaller school compared to Iowa State and that it's closer to home for me.",

It\u2019s definitely around, you can\u2019t really get away from that at most colleges, but alcohol is not technically allowed in the dorms regardless of age. I always found it was more about balance. I made friends with the people in the rooms near mine. I could hangout with them for a while they drank early in the night, but I always knew when it was time to say goodnight and head back to my dorm for the night.",

The thing is is that at Iowa State, I feel like some of the people make you look like an outsider if you don't drink or something. The guy in the room across from me gave me the strangest of looks when I told him I don't drink or vape.",

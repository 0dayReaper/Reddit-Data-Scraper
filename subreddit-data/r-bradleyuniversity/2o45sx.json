Heck one of the most commented/upvoted posts here, is a post about how bad this subreddit is.  \n\nSo what can we do about it?  As one of the mods mentioned most of the mods have since moved on from Bradley, which makes it difficult to grow the subreddit.  We are open to any ideas you may have.  \n\nAdditionally if anyone wants to be a mod feel free to contact us.\n\nUltimately it comes down to people posting, and it can be pretty much anything from a question about which class to take next semester to a picture someone took on their way to class. (for instance look at /r/uiuc)\n\nIf we can get this type of response from one post just imagine what it would be like if people started regularly posting.\n\n**tl;dr** this subreddit sucks (we know), what can we do to make it better?",

As for Great Wall (between the Linh's), well, go to Linh's.\n\nTo a lesser extent I would also add:\n\nAvanti's - because it is pretty good and rather cheap (Italian/Pizza). I still go a bit out of my way to get a Gondola from time to time, although not at that location.\n\nSteak and Fries - typically greasy spoon burgers/steak sandwich type of food. Sometimes greasy is good.\n\nLa Bamba's - open late, the type of Mexican food that one gets when stumbling their way back to campus after a night out\n\nThere are a few other decent places around town, it just depends on how far you are willing to go.",

Also, atmosphere is ok, but i recall my server had a beard like a cat was glued on his chin. I'm not a germ freak and it didn't bother me much, but my buddy was unimpressed.",

Really changes the answers completely. \n\nI always liked Avantis pizza, cheap but not the cardboard crap from little ceasars or the grease bomb from papa johns. Pasand Indian used to be good but they closed down not too long ago. Haddad's has a great gyros sammich. The little mexican ice cream place down main by the innovation center is awesome! Cheaper and more wholesome than sweet cicis IMO, the ice cream stands alone. Happy Fish has all you can eat sushi on Sundays, the service can be really shitty there though. Its no Sushi Gawa but it satisfies and is walkable.  ",

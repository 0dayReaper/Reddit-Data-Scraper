            "comment": "Sorry for the lame and anecdotal answer, but college is what you make out of it. During my time at bradley, I never joined any greek org's and it was fun. I believe my graduating class was only 50&amp;#37; involved in greek life. It felt like more work, but by sophomore year it was awesome. There's a bunch of different clubs depending on what your interests are \\(sports, film, theatre, technology, debate, major related, etc.\\), and even if you're not looking for something like that there are activity nights that RA's will host, and classes are a great way to meet people. That goes for every school though, so try to keep an open mind. With several thousand students in a small community, you're bound to run into people with similar \\- and new \\- interests.  Is there any specific questions you've had? ",

People will make assumptions about you based on your house. Constant drama. Pressure to drink. You won't get along with everyone in your house.\n\nHonestly everyone's experience is different, but after doing it all four years, I probably wouldn't do it again.",

    "postText": "Hey Bradley Students!\n\nI'll be attending Bradley in the fall of 2014. Since my last day of high school was today, I felt it was fitting to start thinking about school for NEXT year.\n\nA little bit about myself: I will be living off campus, since I only live about 10 minutes away. I will be majoring in Computer Science and might get a minor, depending on what classes from my major coincide with each minors available. I play the saxophone and bass, and I plan on playing in a few ensembles (hopefully jazz).\n\nI could really use the advice of current students before I go to orientation. What classes should I take for General Education courses? Which ones are easy A's? What teachers should I NOT take? Any advice on music ensembles? How early should I take my classes since I will be driving and parking? Any cool clubs/organizations I should join? Any advice on a minor? Any advice on making friends, especially since I won't be living in dorms? I'm a guy, by the way.\n\nThanks for any and all advice given!",

            "comment": "Hey Greninjask!\n\nFirstly, [this](http://www.bradley.edu/dotAsset/92ed6a8b-1e44-404b-8683-90e55e35e191.pdf) is the recommended Computer Science course schedule for 4 years. Now of course you don't have to follow it, but it's recommended for a reason. Also, most of the gen-eds are interchangeable. [Here](http://www.bradley.edu/academic/colleges/las/departments/gened/bradley/) is a list of most of the gen-ed courses that Bradley offers and what categories they fall in. \n\nAs for CS courses, I would try to get Dr. Tennyson for 101 and 102. He's really good at teaching in depth and it really helps if you come in without knowing much. He is stricter than the others though and will expect more from you. Also if you have to take a gen-ed CIV course I would recommend Dr. Kampfl. I had him this semester and it was probably the easiest course I've ever taken.\n\nIf you want to play in a band, you have a few options. You can take MUS 142 which is like basic band class from high school except you meet 2 or 3 times a week depending on which of the two bands you get into. If you want to do something jazzy then you could take MUS 146, but I'm not sure how that works exactly. When you get here, talk to Dr. Vroman about it.\n\nAlso, try to get an earlier orientation day. If you come the last few days the classes will be picked over and you'll end up not liking your schedule. And just pick times you know you'll be able to make, because if you start skipping classes, it will be hard to keep up and before you know it you've missed a third of the classes. Skipping class is like renting a hotel room and then sleeping outside for the night.\n\nCS offers a few different concentrations. There's security and networking, mobile development, and game design. If you want a minor though I would just see whatever is possible for you and whatever you'd like to do.\n\nLastly, if you want to make friends I highly suggest getting committed to at least one club. There are a lot of different clubs here you can join and I've made some of my best friends from a club I'm in. During your first week, **make sure you go to the Activities Fair**. Every club and organization will have a table setup around the founder's circle. A good tip is just to sign up for anything you're remotely interested in. You can decide later when they send you an email if you really want to do it or not. Also another tip for making friends that should be obvious is that you won't make them if you stay in your room a lot. It's going to be hard living off campus, but try to mingle around here until you've got a friend group to hang out with. Also, a lot of friend groups start at orientation so keep that in mind.\n\nLastly, I would just like to shamelessly plug Bradley's Video Game Design Club. Seeing as you're going into CS I thought it might interest you. However, you don't have to be any particular major to join. We accept anyone and if you're willing to learn then we're willing to teach. Unfortunately, we haven't ever finished anything really, but we've had a lot of good times and have learned a lot about game making. We'll be at the Activities Fair as well :)\n\nAnyways, I hope this wall of text will help you. Good luck next year!",

I'll have to learn more about which of those bands to join, i've talked to Vroman before so I'll probably email him sometime. My orientation is late June, so that should be early enough to get the classes I want. Also, a game design club sounds absolutely perfect for me, great recommendation! I've made some simple games before in my programming class in high school, and I'd really like to learn more about that kind of stuff. Thanks again!",

            "comment": "Most of the things these people have said are correct. For gen eds just use rate my prof to find a teacher who is easy enough. I would suggest trying to get as late of a schedule as you can, as far as time goes, unless you are a morning person. Getting up in college is so much harder since you have no one to breath down your throat like in high school. As for music I've played in the upper level band. Just be aware it's a huge chunk of time for not much credit, so it might not be worth it for your social life. As far as making friends goes I would say try to meet people during orientation and stay in touch so you have a place to hang out at the dorms. The one thing I haven't seen people say is to rush. Regardless of whether you want to go Greek or not it's a great way to meet hundred of people in a few days. This will get you more people to hang out with in the dorms. Other than that just try out a little bit of everything and don't be afraid to introduce yourself. You'll do great!",

            "comment": "If they still have it, \"Theater Appreciation\" was pretty easy (for me) - learn a bit about theater, go to a few shows (one or two were on-campus, the other was at the Civic Center), and write a bit about the experience. There was another 'appreciation class' but I can't remember what that was (didn't take it).\n\nThere were a few religion classes that I thought were interesting - one of the more basic classes had a portion of the lectures in the big lecture hall in Bradley Hall once or twice a week and was broken into smaller groups for the other day. I was fortunate enough to get Dr. Getz - really knows his stuff (especially when it came to Asia/Japan) and he made it fun. Took another couple of classes with him.\n\nThere was an 'easy' class that was something like \"university life\" that was only a single credit hour and consisted of talking about college. It was EHS something.\n\nI wasn't directly involved with music, but there was a good bit of jazz; I think the head of the music department was in a small jazz group (Dr. Kelly? maybe), I didn't have much interaction, but he seemed like a decent fellow.\n\nMost of the professors I had were good at what they did, and some even made it fun. It's been a while so I can't remember a lot of the names, but the site \"rate my professor\" was a good guide. I might remember the names if I saw them.\n\nAs for groups, there was a fair at the beginning of the year where the groups would be out and you could go around and see a bunch of them.\n\nSorry, my familiarity is a bit dated, so things may have changed since my time there.",

Lab band plays without music, and band plays with music. \nThere are two symphonic bands, band and winds. Winds is where most of the music majors are and they meet on Monday, Wednesday from 4:20-6 and Thursday from 6:15-7:15. Band meets on Tuesday and Thursday from 4:20-6. There's orchestra if you play upright bass which meets from 4:20-6 on Tuesday and Thursday. \nThe best part is that ensembles are free which will prevent you from paying extra if you end up signing up for more than 16 credit hours. They're typically 1 credit hour so they won't inflate your hours too much.\n\nGlad for you to join! You could get a music minor if you like to play music a lot. It's not very many hours and it'll help you understand your music and its purpose better (source: music major). \n\nI don't know much about parking because I don't have a car up here, but classes depend on what time you want to be up and about as well as what time the classes are scheduled for. \n\nAs for friends, a lot of my friends have been from classes I've taken and the organizations I'm a part of. Just be yourself and you'll have friends!",

            "comment": "Hey /u/Greninjask , fellow local here (Chillicothe!). I'm in the Jazz Lab Band (the one that /u/SparkZ94 was talking about), which is the jazz band that meets on Mondays from 7 to 9. It's a great group: we don't use any sheet music at all, everything is completely memorized. I play piano/cornet/trumpet/mellophone/sing depending on what we need that semester. \n\nI think Doc (Dr. Todd Kelly, who is amazing) is changing how auditions work this semester, so I can't really tell you much about the auditions besides the fact that they have always been relatively painless. Essentially, he just wants to make sure that you can play at least on a basic level and are willing to learn and practice/try. It's MUCH less of a time commitment than the Jazz Ensemble, which meets Monday through Thursday at noon. They play more traditional music, and a lot more of it, but that's to be expected since they meet so often. I highly, highly recommend doing Jazz Lab. It's a huge stress-reliever for me and you'll make lots of friends, as well as get to play some fun music. Feel free to shoot me a message or reply on here and I can help you out with anything you need! \n\nAlso, I absolutely cannot stand Vroman. He really knows his stuff, but he is a complete prick. There's a long story that goes with it, but he and I do *not* get along at all, and I know many people who can't stand him either. Just my two cents!\n\nAnyways, as far as some other advice:\n\n* For CS classes, take Tennyson and avoid Wang like the plague. Tennyson is a bit of a strange professor; he gets extremely enthusiastic about everything, **AND HE WILL TALK ABOUT CODE LIKE THIS! ISN'T THAT AWESOME GUYS! YOU TYPE IN \"PRINT 'HELLO WORLD'\" AND IT TYPES HELLO WORLD ON THE SCREEN HOLY CRAP!**\n\n* I don't know if you plan on doing Honors, but even if you don't take some Honors seminars. They are informative and you don't overload on them. They are usually once a week with little to no homework, but you get to learn quite a bit from them. I highly recommend *Rhetoric on Death and Dying* with Laura Bruns, who also teaches sections of COM 103, which is a required Gen Ed. Take her if you can. She's an easy grader and she's pretty good looking too (and coming from a gay guy, that's saying something, haha). Another good honors seminar is *Neurotherapy/Neurofeedback/Biofeedback* with Dr. Russel-Chapin. She's kind of insane and eccentric, but really nice and a great teacher.\n\n* For CS, **avoid Yun Wang at all costs.** She has the heaviest accent I have ever heard besides **George Szeto, who teaches math classes**, and who you should avoid as well. If you want your classes to be exceptionally difficult because you can't understand the teacher, take those two. It probably sounds racist to say that, but it was a huge pain to try and learn anything from Wang.\n\n* For non-CS, my personal worst professors I've had are **Marwin Spiller (Sociology)** who is the most racist man I have ever met, and **Marty Potts (Physics)**. Spiller spends the entire class period (SOC 100/101) telling you how bad white people are. I passed his class with an A by writing every paper about how white people are awful. It's idiotic. Potts, the physics teacher, will spend the entire class period complaining about his wife and telling you his life story. Then, halfway through a 3 hour period, he'll start teaching you Physics. And by physics, I mean he'll teach you the wrong formulas and equations, and then send you into the tests (which are written by the good professors, Kimberlin and Lazano) to fail because he taught you wrong. Out of my class that started at 22, only 5 (Myself plus four others) passed, because of his idiocy.\n\n*Since you only live 10 minutes away, I'd aim to be on campus about 15 minutes before class at the latest. Sometimes parking can be a bitch on busy days.  \n\n* For clubs and organizations, like Sparkz94 said, go to the activities fair! You'll meet a lot of people and see what campus has to offer. The biggest thing for making friends is *getting involved.* At your orientations, make friends with your orientation group! Find someone in your group who you get along with and walk with them from activity to activity. Hang out with them during free time. Spend your time at orientation meeting people; the orientation is much better used as a vehicle to make friends than to learn campus. You'll learn more about the campus in 2 weeks of being in class than you will at any of the orientation crap. Make sure you get to an early orientation too. The earlier orientations get to pick classes first, and you definitely want that so you don't have to go to an 8 AM Calc class. \n\n* Not being in the dorms is going to suck. I know that's probably not what you want to hear, but it's true. My friends who go to Bradley that don't live in the dorms regret it. You will meet SO many less people. Your roommate in the dorm may suck, or they may become your best friend. Your next dorm neighbors may suck, or they may become your best friends. I could have saved $10,000 a year by not living in the dorms for two years, but I'm so glad I did. The dorms are tiny, and you to share a bathroom with 20~ other people, and you'll probably see a bunch of drunk people running around the hallways at 4 am, and you'll have to deal with a roommate and whatever that entails, but it's worth it. If you're living at home, you aren't getting your money's worth out of college. If you have the ability AT ALL, whether it's scholarships, student loans, working, prostitution, whatever, then you really should live in the dorms for at least a semester. If you don't like it, fine, you can go back home, but trust me, you don't want to miss out on it. Being able to go out with your friends at 2AM to a frat party/McDonald's/Student Center/Center Court is where all of your bonding with your friends is going to happen. Noone who lives on campus will want to attempt to find a way to your house to hang out with your parents there and no access to their stuff or their other friends. I know it sounds mean, but it's true. Being such a small campus, Bradley has a pretty close-knit student community, and a big part of that is the fact that 99% of the students are only a 3 minute walk away from each other.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but I hope it helps. Feel free to message me with any other questions you have! Or shoot me a PM with your Facebook URL and we can talk over Facebook since that's easier than Reddit comments, haha.",

I will definitely avoid those professors you mentioned. Lab band sounds like it would be really cool! No sheet music is a bassist's dream come true. I was planning on doing the midday ensemble simply because thats what Im used to, but i might reconsider! It also depends on how my schedule works out. And yeah, when I made the decision to live off canpus, i did so just to save the money. I really REALLY want to live in the dorms, but tuition is just too high as it is. Maybe in a year or so I'll be able to move in",

I still vote that you (if you can!) take out whatever student loads that you need to and live in the dorms if at all possible! \n\nBut yeah, the jazz bands are great. The midday ensemble is a **ton** of work, especially if you aren't a music major, so I'd probably do Jazz Lab for at least a semester or two to see how you handle your classes first, haha. Most people do that anyways and then move up to Ensemble if they have the time to do so.",

Palakeel *may* do ENG 100, and he's good (easy).  Connely/Craig are good as well. Blough, Stein and Swafford are well-loved by English majors, but I never had them. \n\n AVOID Jost and Vickroy in English. \n\nPolitical Science: \n\nGobeyn. Just take Gobeyn. If he's not available Curtis is your second-best option. Aspin is nice and a good teacher, but he makes the class difficult. Gill is the same way: sweet lady, but damn is she confusing. Just AVOID Dannehl.\n\nOther: Robert Fuller does a pretty interesting class on Eastern religions. \n\nDisclaimer: I graduted in '06, so there are a couple new additions to each of these departments. \n\n",

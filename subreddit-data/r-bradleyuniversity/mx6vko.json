            "comment": "I am a grad student at Bradley and have been there for the last 7 years and am also not into parties or drinking. There are still plenty of options to get involved and make friends on campus even if you aren't into those. There are many clubs and organizations you can choose to join, and I was part of several that were good social outlets for me. \n\nI won't name drop any of the ones I was in in particular, but my recommendation is know what interests you and make sure to check out the activities fair. Don't be worried about stepping out of your comfort zone too; I joined a co-ed service organization on campus and got VERY involved in and really enjoyed it despite thinking I wasn't super interested in service or leadership before joining. \n\nIf there is an interest you have and want to see a club for it on campus, you can absolutely make it. In 2014 there were no video game or board game clubs on campus and now there are many of them because people took the initiative to make these clubs.\n\nHope that helps! Let me know if you want to know anything else.",

There is a mall, bowling alley and movie theater 5 minutes from campus. The city of Peoria doesn\u2019t have too much but they sometimes have Broadway shows and of course Bradley basketball games are always fun; and the river walk looks great. About 30 minutes away there is a nice apple orchard. I\u2019m sure I can even list more stuff; there\u2019s a bunch you can do",

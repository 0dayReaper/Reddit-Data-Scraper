Was once almost mugged by someone when leaving shell and walking to my car which was parked in the campus town area. For food, there is just about every food place you can thing of somewhere within 15 min of the campus and city; I recommend for breakfast eating at Childer\u2019s it\u2019s really good but can get crowded quickly and for dinner I recommend the blue duck restaurant (located in the city along the river and is a nice area for pictures or a walk). When it comes to activities it just depends on the time your there. Unfortunately with COVID I don\u2019t think there are any Broadway shows going on in Peoria but they once had Book of Mormon and The Lion King (not a small production the real thing). There\u2019s a good shopping mall and a huge AMC theater not too far away. I\u2019m not familiar with any clubs, let me know if you have any other questions",

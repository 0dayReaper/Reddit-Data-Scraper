While KABOOM! is a phrase popularized by the legendary Dave Snell, it is only used for the men's basketball games. I don't see how the mascot is reflective of sports beyond Bradley basketball. Like you my good friend, I hope it will catch on and be something we can get behind and make cool. As is though, I'm finding it hard to support it myself.",

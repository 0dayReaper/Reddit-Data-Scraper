Sorry it's a lot, however I love this school so I would love to know more!!\n\nHow is the Greek life/social scene?\n\nIs the food good?! I've heard mixed reviews. Also, I know each dorm doesn't have a place to eat, so how is living in a dorm that doesn't have a diner center?\n\nSince it's small, how is the college life like? I would prefer to go to a school where people actually stay during the weekends.",

            "comment": "Just graduated but another perspective nonetheless. \n\nGreek life is very active, I think it was something like 33% of the campus. You can usually find a party every weekend (except siblings weekend for obvious reasons) if that's your thing. If not, its pretty easy to meet people with the school being so small compared to other universities. Once you find a group you like to hang out with its easy to find stuff to do.\n\nFood... I have also heard mixed reviews about it. It depends on the dining hall I think. Williams is meh. Small dining hall and I always felt cramped. I usually went to Geisert since I lived in Wyckoff though. When I was freshman 4 years ago they had just finished redoing it. Food was decent for a cafeteria. Its not a five star dining experience but with the system they have where you just swipe to get in and you can eat as must as you want its not a bad deal. Student center is probably the best place for lunch since it is a bit quicker and more on campus (even if that just means on the other side of the street). Can't speak for Center Court because they changed it my Junior year (I think) and I never went back.\n\nIts really not that bad living in a dorm without a dining hall. You get used to it pretty quick. None of them are that far from the dorms so you don't notice.\n\nCollege life was fun. It was nice that everything was right there. Small school means less walking. I could leave my house 5 minutes before class and be there with a minute to spare People definitely stay on the weekends but of course it all depends on who you hang out with.\n\nI can answer other more specific questions like certain programs (I majored in Electrical Engineering so obviously I'll know more about that), Greek life (I was in a fraternity). Anything else and I'll do my best. ",

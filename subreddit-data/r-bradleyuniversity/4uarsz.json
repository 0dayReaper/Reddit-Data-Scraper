However, I read some posts on here about the physics professors being a little...well, meh, for lack of a better word. I am actually planning to major in physics education so this is a concern for me. What were your experiences with the professors in the physics department? What are their teaching styles like? What about them makes them not so great in your opinions? ",

But if you're like me and a lot of other students and just want to pass with little effort they can be a pain because the professors don't tend to baby you that much. \n\nSource: had Lazano and Teske",

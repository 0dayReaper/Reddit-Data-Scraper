This is my last semester at Bradley and, AFAIK, /u/forgenet either already has or will be graduating as well. We would like to have a current, long-term-ish student as a moderator. If you are active and genuinely interested in being a moderator, please apply and send us a mod mail. We will take every application seriously and hope to add a new member to our moderating team.\n\nThank you",

    "postText": "If you haven't already noticed in the sidebar, Bradley University now has a new app! Keep connected while on campus using this student-made app. It has anything and everything you may need, whether it be upcoming events, what movie is playing at the student center, President Glasser's office hours, campus contacts, places to eat around campus,  a map to find your way, pictures submitted by other students, or maybe even the weather.\n\nI am not going to list everything because there is so much to write about. Please download the app and support the students that made it because they are fighting to keep the app available. The more people that download it, the more it can be improved.\n\nAnd the best part? **IT'S FREE!**\n\n**Downloads**\n\n[App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brave-life/id789568891?mt=8)\n\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goodbarber.bradleyapp)",

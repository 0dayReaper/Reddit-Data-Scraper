Half.com (by eBay) used to be how I got a lot of my books for a much more reasonable price than the bookstore.\n\nIf you need software, check around, a lot of vendors offer educational discounts (up to 100% off) for as long as you are a student.\n\nIt's a shame there isn't a grocery store in CampusTown anymore, it wasn't all that great, but it was way better than nothing, especially for those that didn't drive. Not really sure what I would have done without that option, I suppose you'd be stuck with the bus or finding someone with a car.",

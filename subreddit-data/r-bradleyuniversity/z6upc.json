I'm going to guess they would be 'new things' for you, and you don't need to know a thing in order to join them:\n\nSwing dance, which meets from 8-10pm on Sunday nights on the Markin upper level (room near weights), is fairly popular.  Very social, friendly club.\n\nPersonal plug from me would be the fencing club since I'm very involved.  6-8pm on Tuesday and Thursday nights in the Markin basement.  \n\nSalsa dance meets Thursdays in the Markin basement starting at 6:30pm. \n\nMixed Martial Arts meets 8-10pm Tuesdays and Thursdays in the Markin basement.\n\nAlso, the [club sports](http://bradley.edu/campuslife/sao/) page might have a few interests for you, and there's contact information.\n\nEDIT: I looked at some of your content history to see if there's anything I could recommend.  You're a fan of my favorite, favorite, favorite button mashing game...",

I think all you've got to do is go to the Student Activities Office in Sisson Hall -which is connected to the Student Center- and fill out a form.  All you need is someone to be your vice president and a faculty member to be an advisor.\n\nGetting members is the hard part.",

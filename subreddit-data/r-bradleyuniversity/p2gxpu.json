    "postText": "Hi, I'm a freshman that's going to be living in University Hall, specifically a Type 1 room. I'm wondering if anyone could give me some information as to where the ethernet ports are located in those rooms. I'm trying to plan out my networking within the room, including where to put an ethernet switch and where to run ethernet cables, but I have no idea where those ports are located. I would assume there's one next to the desks and one over by the lofted beds, but I don't actually know. Any information would be appreciated!",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I was wondering if someone could tell me about some houses (or apartments) for rent on campus. I was hoping to move in with 1-3 other roommates for next year. Any advice is appreciated! Also if there are any facebook pages or something to find other roommates that anyone knows of that would be great too! So far it's been kinda hard finding friends with corona going on and all :/",

            "comment": "Most houses are for 3 or more people. Just drive around campus and you will see signs in the yards for properties that are available. For apartments you are kind of limited, there is Main St. Commons (expensive but nice), St. James (fine but kind of overpriced and small), SAC (singles mainly but decent), and Ideal Rentals apartment building on University (older but pretty cheap). I'd recommend a house over the apartments, the houses are all older but you will have a lot more space.",

Houses are definitely where its at but you'll want to know the people first as the rental companies will only give leases to set groups.",

    "postText": "Trying to get GPA up after rough fall semester, taking a J-Term. (Freshman Mechanical Engineering major)\n\nDebating whether to take Statics and get it out of the way or something easy like Film Appreciation, but equally as important is that I can get an A. It's the difference of 0.4 pts on my cumulative.\n\nStatics is with Sihyun Kim. Couldn't find anything about him on ratemyprofessor. Is he okay? Is his class doable?",

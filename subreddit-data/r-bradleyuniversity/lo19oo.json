    "postText": "As the post's title implies, I am a high school senior who is planning on attending Bradley University to study engineering. I am using a throwaway as to not put personally identifiable information on my real Reddit account. Anyways, I have a few general questions about Bradley University. I would be immensely grateful if anyone would be willing to offer their insight or opinions to answer any of the following questions:\n\nHousing:\n- What is the best residence hall, and why? (I am male.)\n - Are roommates assigned randomly, or is there some sort of system to match people with similar interests?\n\nActivities/Organizations:\n- Does Bradley have a Quiz Bowl team?\n- What are the best activities, clubs, organizations, etc. for meeting people, learning, and having fun?\n- How does the Greek system compare to other colleges? Should I consider joining?\n\nHonors Program:\n- What are the benefits of Bradley's honors program?\n- How is the honors program different from the normal one?\n\nAcademics:\n- Which classes did you enjoy most in your freshman year?\n- Which classes do you wish you had/hadn't taken as a freshman?\n- Does anyone have experience with switching majors at Bradley? Is it a smooth transition?\n\nAgain, I have deep gratitude for anyone who would be willing to take the time to answer some of these questions that I have. Thanks, and I hope you have a great weekend.",

            "comment": "Heitz is the best dorm hall because of how spacious the rooms are. The rooms in heitz are massive. And there is a system that matches you with a roommate of similar interests or you can request someone and if they request you then you get assigned together.\n\nAs far as activities go, there's a lot of clubs but not every one of them is able to do online. Right now since clubs have to be online only, it's not like there's a club fair like normal for you too see all your options. Campus life took a big hit from quarantine so don't expect much there. \n\nAs far as best classes for a freshman, I definitely recommend taking your car first major required classes and focus on finishing your BCC as soon as possible. These are all your gen ed required classes. I transferred 9 credits in but I've been taking all required classes since freshman year and now in my 2nd sophomore semester, I'll finish my BCC before my junior year, so the next 2 years are all major and minor focused with whatever electives I might like.",

While it is kinda old, the dining hall is in the basement so I don't have to go outside to get food if it's bad weather. They have a matching system for roommates if you don already have someone you want to room with.\n\n**Activities:** \n\n[https://bradley.presence.io/organizations](https://bradley.presence.io/organizations)\n\nI myself am involved in Esports, Orchestra, and  Robotics Club!\n\n**Honors:** \n\nI don't really know much about the honors program. I'm going to get my degree either way so why take honor courses? I already am busy with my major. That's my thought at least.\n\n**Academics:**\n\nI enjoyed my ECE classes. What I did not enjoy was chemistry! It was mandatory to take a semester of it. I have a friend who changed his major around once or twice if I remember correctly. The process seems to go pretty smooth for him.\n\n\\- Hope this helps :)",

The content is the same, but the format is learning is different. There are also the seminars, which are 1 credit hour courses on almost anything you can imagine, from Star Trek  to shipwrecks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe biggest perk of the Honors program is early registration though: Students in the Honors program with above a 3.2 GPA can register on the morning registration opens instead of waiting for the normal time for their cohort.\n\nOther perks include doughnuts in the Honors office a few times per semester, and Honors housing (floors in Williams that are mainly Honors students and can draw from the Honors fund for activities)",

That helped me fill my schedule for sophomore year registration, since I didn't have many credits built up freshman year. There are also the other perks of seminar classes, cultural events, and I guess I missed it on donuts lol.\n\nI will say that living in hall with a cafeteria is very nice in the winter. Personally I enjoyed Geisert or Harper layouts the best. The closets kind of separated the room into desk and sleep/couch areas with those floor plans. \n\nThere are clubs for a ton of things, and in the first week there will probably be a lot advertising for new members. When I was there they had ultimate Frisbee, nerf commandos, movie clubs, gaming groups, and more. If you live in the dorms, there will be floor events and intramural sports all the time too. They used to have a big activity fair, although I don't know how that's been affected by covid. Early in the semester Greek life will also have a tour will called Rush. If interested at all in a fraternity, you should start there,and it's a great way to meet people even if you don't join any. Don't feel like you have to, as Bradley has a good split between Greek life students and non Greek. \n\nMost classes available to a freshman are fine too take as a freshman lol. If recommend the ece course as another meeting people opportunity. They also have guest speakers from groups around campus. I started as undecided engineering, and ended up switching majors 4 times just fine. Depending on the programs you might have to catch up on hours somewhere over the summer but all my Bradley credit hours counted for something.\n\nMy experience is a little outdated but hopefully still helpful. Good luck with your schooling, and enjoy the time with friends!",

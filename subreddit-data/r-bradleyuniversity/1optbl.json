I'm sure someone on this site could do better.  Our offer still stands for someone with webdesign experience.\n\nPlease make sure to share this with everyone you know.  More announcements to come.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFeel free to voice any thoughts below.",

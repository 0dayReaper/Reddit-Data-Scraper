You can buy, or sell anything you want to other students, ranging from dorm supplies, textbooks, lost&amp; found, promote services, tutoring, apparel (anything really!) ride-sharing, to subleasing or finding off-campus housing for next year ...\n\nYou can only log in once you verify your **bradley\\*\\*.edu\\*\\*** school email!\n\nThe app is free, I am not making any money off it, a lot of hard work went into it so make sure you check it out if you need anything for the upcoming semesters! \n\niOS: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/college-souk/id1560441766](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/college-souk/id1560441766)\n\nandroid: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.collegesouk.souk&amp;hl=en\\_US&amp;gl=US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.collegesouk.souk&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US) and tell your friends!\n\nalso follow on ig for support [https://www.instagram.com/collegesouk/](https://www.instagram.com/collegesouk/) I'm gonna post useful stuff soon \n\nLastly, please go ahead and post something people are already using it :) \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc2b hope it helps (upvote for visibility)! \n\n\\- might be a little glitchy on galaxy hoping to fix that soon",

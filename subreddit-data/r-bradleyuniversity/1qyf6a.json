Also, I don't know if you'll be interested or not, but my old roommate and I made flyers for our server last year that we tried to set up in our dorm room. The server didn't really work out, but I still have the file for the flyers on my computer if you want it.\n\nAlso, my IGN is SparkZZZ. I'll try to get on sometime within the week.",

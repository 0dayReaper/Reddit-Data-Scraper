I'm just wondering what your guys' general opinion about Bradley is. I decided really randomly (naviance college super match..yay indecision) and won't be visiting until orientation. Also any advice so that I won't be a super freshmen would be awesome. ",

I didn't join any sororities, but met a few nice people who I was friends with for about a year. However the friendships all faded away because they were all so busy with greek activities which I had no interest in. Rush for sororities is so tightly managed and choreographed, and the whole time strangers are judging you and deciding whether they like you enough to invite you back to the house in the next round. It can be a bit stressful for those 2 days- don't let anyone try to pressure you into doing it if you don't want to.\n\nAll my good friends and current and future roomates are people I met either on my floor of the dorms, at clubs, or from activities. Take part in floor activities - it actually does help you meet people. The activities fair is a great place to find out about stuff you might be interested in - give a lot of clubs a chance and go to a meeting or two, then stick with the few you really enjoy. The salsa or swing dancing club are good even if you have no dance experience - both are free, fun, and the people there are super friendly and helpful towards beginners. \nEdit: I just added a bit more info.",

[I just looked over the site, and they do]\n\nAt the start of the school year the [Student Activities Office (SAO)](http://www.bradley.edu/sao/) would block off the [Olin Quad and the area around the Founders Circle](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=bradley+university&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.697799,-89.615141&amp;spn=0.001476,0.005638&amp;sll=37.6,-95.665&amp;sspn=25.186794,92.373047&amp;hq=bradley+university&amp;t=m&amp;z=18) (the place names will be a little overwhelming at first Nichole, but a benefit to a small campus is that there isn't much to learn) and pack it with some of the various student groups.\n\nMuch like reddit, Bradley had a group for pretty much everything, so depending on what you are interested in there is probably something for you.\n\nLike buffetboy says, you have some time, so don't worry too much.\n\nAs a note, if you don't see a club for something you are interested in, it isn't difficult to start one; just go to the SAO and one of the student workers should be more than capable of helping you out.\n\nSome resources:\n\n* [SAO](http://www.bradley.edu/sao/)\n* [Organizations](http://www.bradley.edu/campuslife/sao/organizations/)\n* [Campus map](http://www.bradley.edu/dotAsset/86318.pdf) - I kept one of these in my bag for quite a while\n\n---\n\nOther notes: the campus has changed considerably since my time there, and Campus Town (the strip mall across the street) has gone through a lot of changes as well. Despite that, there are a few places that are still there:\n\n* Avanti's (reasonably priced Italian food, pizza, and sandwiches - I still stop by occasionally for a Gondola)\n* One World Cafe (cafe, a little higher priced but some good food)\n* \"[china town](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bradley+University,+West+Bradley+Avenue,+Peoria,+IL&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.699784,-89.612366&amp;spn=0.000746,0.002819&amp;sll=37.6,-95.665&amp;sspn=25.186794,92.373047&amp;oq=bradley+univ&amp;hq=Bradley+University,+West+Bradley+Avenue,+Peoria,+IL&amp;t=m&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.699784,-89.612366&amp;panoid=S_a1u6DxpGDdtYacxT7VjA&amp;cbp=12,12.46,,0,2.65)\" - this street view pretty much captures the extent of Asian cuisine during my time there (unless you count the Panda Express in Campus Town) - Thanh Linh Vietnamese, Great Wall Chinese, Linh's Food Market, and Pasand Indian Cuisine.\n\nDisclosure: I am an alumnus and I was involved with the SAO/ACBU",

It's not necessary though and not joining one will give you a similar, if not better, college experience. I guess what I'm saying is, don't do something just because people tell you do it. Do research. \n\nAlso, go onto ratemyprofessor.com before signing up for any classes. You don't want to get stuck with a terrible professor that will ruin what should be a fair class. Oh, and, if you can, take your Math Gen-Ed somewhere other than Bradley if you can. Our Math program is notoriously bad.",

Honestly, the classes and sections you have access to are so limited you just want to make a schedule that actually works with no overlap- you only have a short time period during Orientation to figure it all out and it can sometimes be tricky if a lot of sections of classes conflict with each other time wise. 1st semester classes aren't usually all that hard anyway. Definitely use it for later semesters though, and talk to your friends about who they've had in the past and if the professor was good or bad. \n\nI agree about the math- don't take it right off the bat if you don't have to, so you can spend some time researching and pick a good one. It's surprisingly easy to transfer in gen-ed credit from community college courses, which you can take over summers, as long as you talk to your adviser first and make sure you're taking the right classes.",

            "comment": "Welcome Nicole, I graduated from Bradley last May. Like others have said, if you want to make the most out of your college experience you need to get involved on campus as much as possible. Such a small school is perfect for cultivating leadership and social skills needed for post-collegiate life.\n\nI strongly recommend rushing when you get to campus, joining Greek life is a wonderful way to hit the ground running with involvement and meeting a wide variety of people. Sorority rush can be intimidating and put-offish, so ask around and strongly get to know a few girls in the chapters you're interested in before making a decision. After rush is over, Greek life and thus campus social life returns to normal. I joined a Fraternity during my second semester and I wish I would have joined in the Fall. \n\nWhen you move into your dorm, you will have a resident advisor (RA) and an assistant resident advisor (ARA). These individual, if competent members of staff, are wonderful resources for support. Do not hesitate to go to them with questions, concerns, or just to hang out. Just get to know their personalities and tendencies first as staff members tend to be very diverse and strongly opinionated about issues such as Greek life, student government, and certain aspects of socializing. \n\nAcademically, the best advice I can give you is to visit your professors office hours and establish a good relationship with them. Often times this is the difference between an A and a B at the end of the semester. Even if you understand the material, ask them a question anyway and be engaged in what they have to say. Many times you can get a feel for what questions will be on an upcoming exam. I cannot stress enough how helpful establishing a relationship with your instructors can be. \n\nLastly, take care of your health. You're a runner, that's great. Campus and few streets behind Fredonia are great places to run, but make sure you're running in safe areas. Ask around with other runners to get to know the best places. I recommend Laura Bradley Park for long runs, it is hilly, quiet, and safe. The Markin center is a great facility as well, it was just opened in 2008 in my freshmen year. This is a no brainer, but eat right, get enough sleep, and wash your hands often. Illnesses can spread easily throughout the dorms and classrooms but if you keep your immune system up to snuff you'll stand a better chance of combating this. If you suspect you have an infection, just list of the symptoms with the health centers and get some antibiotics asap. No use staying sick for weeks because you avoided treatment. \n\nAlso befriend an upperclassmen with a car. You'll be able to go grocery shopping, go to the movies, or go get some Chipolte if you know someone with a car. \n ",

Some majors are easier to study abroad and have the classes count towards your degree. \n\nFor example, a business student will have an easier time finding classes that count towards their degree plan than a nursing student per university eequirements. I would recommend saving some of your general education courses like English or writing classes to take abroad. You also have to consider what classes are even offered at different locations by the university that partner with Bradley.\n\nBut I would say overall, the study abroad office is good about helping students figure it out. Just be upfront at the beginning with your advisor about your plans, and they will also help you plan out for 4 year degree plan to fit study abroad programs.\n\n(I studied abroad for a semester in London while at Bradley)",

I liked the professors I had, the friends I made, and the opportunities that I experienced. But I only attend Bradley, and I don't have another experience to compare it to decide if it was worth the money necessarily.\n\nI guess it really depends on you and what you make out of your own college experience, wherever you end up going for school.",

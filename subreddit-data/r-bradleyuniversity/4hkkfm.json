I know someone released an extension for chrome that ties that into the course guide  called RateMyBradley, and it's really great. That being said, if you have to take something in the physics department, there is no right answer, so good luck on that front. All in all, the professors are very personable, and if you stop by their office hours in most cases they'll help through any issues you're having. I've had a grand total of one bad experience with a professor but I won't name names, since it seems to have been fairly specific to my situation. Good luck, and if you ever have any questions or need anything, feel free to PM me!",

Trust me.\n\nThe only professor it doesn't have right, imo, is Vroman the band director. He can be incredibly hellish and ruined band for me my freshman year. Make sure you love music enough to take a beating before you set one foot into that music department.",

There are always outliers in both directions, of course, but for the most part I'm extremely happy with my experience.\n\nAreas that were a little weak were a few of my physics professors and one of my mechanical engineering professors.  Nothing that put my success at risk, but it was certainly a little rough in a few courses.  All of my interactions and courses in the COM areas were awesome, but I only took and few.\n\nBest of luck--welcome to Bradley :)",

You're going to have a variety of professors most likely because of gen eds, but the only professor I ever actually disliked was in a math class I took. PM me if you have any questions about anything :)",

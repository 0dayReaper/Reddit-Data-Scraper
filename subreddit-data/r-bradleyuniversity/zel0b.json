However, they've already improved dramatically in how they're doing things- none of those silly artsy pots, more fresh fruit, etc.  I still miss some of the old offerings-they haven't really impressed me with any of their vegetarian options.\n\nI'm just hoping they continue this trend of improvements through out the year.",

I'm impressed with what they've done with the Student Center (yet that janky piano lives on) and I'm pretty pumped to try some Moe's. \n\nI will say, though, that service at Center Court has slowed down considerably...and that's putting it nicely. Everything is cooked to order, which is nice, but I feel it should be an option as opposed to the default. I loved Center Court for its on-the-go convenience and that really has gone out the window.\n\nThe prices are also pretty ridiculous, and that's factoring in the increased meal plan as well. I think there could be quite a few people zapped of meal plan by early November. Granted, those people could budget their trips a bit better but it's quite the wallet shock coming from last year.",

            "comment": "The nursing program is tough, as any nursing program will be, but they have high placement and a really great relationship with some local hospitals. There isn't a ton to do in Peoria from what you see on the surface. I've grown up here and a lot of what I see is stuff that's only fun when you're 21. A lot of people are gonna be dead set on just drinking at Bradley but I can tell you I made plenty of friends and didn't drink at a single party till after I was 21. It all depends on what you're interested in. If you like theater, there's a pretty active department at Bradley. If you like music there are constant music events happening on or near campus. If you like sports, we've got plenty of that too, though you may want to get used to your team not always winning. By and large, Bradley is full of really awesome people who have a lot of fun.  Also I'm in the business program and it's fantastic. A lot of fun to be had, and usually no Friday classes after freshman year. Plus you're gonna have the new business/engineering center finished while you're at Bradley so that'll be awesome. ",

            "comment": "I've heard nursing is pretty tough, but its going to be though no matter where you go. I'm not a nursing major but it is one of the harder majors here. Business I'd say is pretty good as well. We are starting to build a new business and engineering complex this summer which will replace two aging buildings on campus. So if you do come here that would be nice to have your classes there. I'm a senior and I've really enjoyed my college career here at Bradley. There are tons of clubs to join and get involved with, pretty much for any interest you have there will be a club for it. Our campus is very Greek and it is certainly a major part of campus life so if you are considering joining Greek life Bradley is a great place for it. Since you are considering between Loyola and Bradley think about what kind of campus you would like. Loyola being in Chicago will have more of an urban big city feel. Peoria is a mid sized city and Bradley is in a kind of an older residential area. There are quite a few shops on main and campus town so you don't really ever have to get too far away from campus but Peoria has a lot to explore. Also there are some great nature areas around Peoria if you are interested in that. If you enjoy city life then I'd say choose Loyola, If the city life stresses you out then I'd choose Bradley. They are both great schools so I'm sure you'll do fine at either one. Good Luck!",

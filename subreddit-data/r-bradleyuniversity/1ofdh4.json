Put in a few stickies for things like deals around bradley, weekly events, find friends with similar interests, bradley webcams, geocaching...\n\n**3.**  IRC channel\n\n**4.**  Grassroots approach:  \n     Create a sign that says something like \"Do you reddit?  Then join the Bradley University Subreddit!\" Have a picture of the reddit alien, along with a [QR code](http://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/) for quick easy access to the site.  Maybe list a few benefits of the site, (meet new people, find apartments for rent, ...)\n\nThen post it around the dorms possibly get an ad in the scout, try to get the radio station involved.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThoughts/suggestions?\n\n~~I'm not a mod so I can't accomplish these tasks.~~  I'm just here to get the ball rolling.\n\n* **[flyer contest](http://redd.it/1ogvg0)**\n\n* **[calling all css/graphic design wizards](http://redd.it/1ogqwx)**\n\n**tl;dr**  This site needs to see more involvement for the benefit of everyone",

I agree with your statement but making the content useful and also engaging is important.  \n\nIt would probably be a good idea to see the mods perspective.  It may be a good idea to see if we could get some more mods involved so that way everything doesn't just fall on two peoples shoulders.",

I have some issues though:\n\n**1.** I am terrible at CSS and can't really do much there.\n\n**2.** No issues with this point\n\n**3.** I'll set this up but if there isn't any activity then I don't see any point in keeping it going.\n\n**4.** [Here](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=200x200&amp;cht=qr&amp;chld=|1&amp;chl=http%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2FNZ4LJp) is your QR Code. Maybe next activity fair have a booth or something. I'm a pre-med biology major in my last year so I don't exactly have much time to organize this stuff so if you want to jump the gun here, be my guest.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, if someone wants to take care of any of this send me a PM and we'll discuss details. \n\nCoolbeans?\n\nCoolbeans.",

You should be prepared for this to absolutely consume your life for periods of time. It's also worth noting that if you're just now starting, make sure you try and make a group of friends who are in the same major as you. It's much easier if you share the load with others by creating study groups and helping each other with homework. I kind of think that goes for all majors though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: also I'm pretty sure you're going to have to dissect a dead cat at some point, so prepare yourself for that.",

            "comment": "Bradley's Nursing program is challenging but it creates highly skilled nurses. My wife graduated with her BSN summa cum laude in 2012. Her and the others in her cohort are doing very well. Many of them have acquired NP degrees and are leaders on their floor despite low seniority. \n\nWork hard and reap the rewards. Form study groups with your cohort. if you are one of the brighter ones, help teach the students falling behind. A shift in perspective aids your own understanding of the material. During A&amp;P, go to lab every chance you can and study your cat. That class is tough and it helps.  \n\nNursing is a tough career but can be very rewarding. Nursing pays well starting out but there is a short ceiling. Consider you option for an advanced degree after working for a bit.",

Pritzker\u2019s \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order for Illinois which starts at 5:00 p.m. Saturday, March 21 has required a change in Bradley University\u2019s plans to allow students to retrieve their belongings from their residence halls this weekend.\u00a0\n&gt;\nAs of\u00a0Friday, March 20, 2020 at 10 p.m. move-out of the residence halls, St. James Apartments, and SAC has been suspended.\u00a0 Students\u00a0should not\u00a0return to campus to retrieve their belongings, regardless of where they live.\n&gt;\nThere are a number of practical questions that students and their families will have as a result of this decision.\n&gt;\nI offer some initial information here:\n&gt;\nWhen can we retrieve our belongings?\u00a0We will schedule alternative move out times in the future. We ask for your patience and courtesy as we develop systems to provide those alternatives.\u00a0\n&gt;\nIs my stuff safe?\u00a0Please rest assured that your belongings are safe and the residence halls will remain locked and secured.\n&gt;\nWhat if I already have permission to be on campus?\u00a0Those who received permission to remain on campus may plan to remain. You must continue social distancing.\u00a0 Please do connect with friends and family via phone and digital tools. Any student who now wishes to depart from campus should notify the Housing Office about their departure at\u00a0[housing@fsmail.bradley.edu](mailto:housing@fsmail.bradley.edu).\u00a0 Because of the current orders in place for the state of Illinois, students who choose to depart campus may not return; it is a risk for the community to come and go.\u00a0\n&gt;\nWill there be food during \u201cShelter in Place?\u201d\u00a0Food to-go is available to all students approved to remain on campus during \u201cshelter in place.\u201d It will be available through Williams Hall at specific times. Please see the student\u00a0[FAQ](https://www.bradley.edu/sites/coronavirus/communications/sites/coronavirus/faq/students/)\u00a0for details.\n&gt;\nI have an internship, co-op, practicum, clinicals, or student teaching.\u00a0If your site has been suspended, you should return home.\u00a0 If these opportunities resume, we will revisit housing options for you at a later date.\n&gt;\nFinancial Adjustments.\u00a0If you still have items in your room but are not staying, you will receive the same financial adjustments as those who completely move out.\u00a0 All decisions on financial adjustments are still forthcoming.\n&gt;\nOff-campus housing, including Main Street Commons.\u00a0Those who are living in other off-campus housing, including Main Street Commons, must work with their landlords on all matters related to their housing.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\nThank you for your patience and understanding during these difficult and ever-changing times.\n&gt;\nIf you have questions or concerns, please email us at\u00a0[housing@bradley.edu](mailto:housing@bradley.edu)\u00a0or call (309) 677-1111.

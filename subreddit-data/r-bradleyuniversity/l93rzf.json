Most of the faculty are passionate and knowledgeable, and there's usually a bunch of events happening on campus. I don't know much about the sports comm program, but if you have any questions, please feel free to DM me!",

Campus life is pretty nice once you meet people or go to events, though it\u2019s kind of lacking a bit right now bc of covid, but there\u2019s still a good community.",

            "comment": "The communications program is the best program. So many great tools and professors to help you. I have a problem with the school administration. Increasing tuition to \"train professors how to adjust to online\" when they already used the same tools they use now. Bookstore not warning you when to return rented textbooks and making you buy them full price without any notification. Parking tickets for BACKING INTO A SPACE. The school likes to do a ton of bullshit to get more money out of you, but the classes themselves are really good. And when there isn't a pandemic there's a ton of fun events and activities to do around campus.",

They\u2019re some of the most understanding and well grounded people I\u2019ve ever met. As for the major you have to know it\u2019s really up to you what direction you focus on. If you want to broadcast, write articles, or create a platform you can do that. It\u2019s just down to you to find out what area of sports communication you want to focus on.",

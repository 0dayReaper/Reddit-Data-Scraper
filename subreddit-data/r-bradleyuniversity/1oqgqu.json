It's definitely helping our club come up with more recognizable logs/personal brand than just the 'B' with a shield, which has a strict process to be used on t-shirts. ",

            "comment": "Kind of lame. Bradley really has no famous or long standing tradition of gargoyles so this feels like the equivalent of somebody giving themselves their own nickname. \n\nIn regards toward reducing student apathy towards athletics, Bradley students will not rally behind athletics because of a mascot, they will rally around a winning team. \n\nAlso, from my experiences at Bradley, there is a certain animosity towards many the school's athletes. The school is small enough that students interact with athletes often enough to see the benefits they receive and feel resentful of them. Seeing them receive benefits like free tutoring, free high quality Bradley apparel, and free extra meal plans for being an athlete on a team that struggles to win can leave other students wondering why their tuition money is funding such luxuries. Athletes must also be aware of their conduct off of the field or court. While most are studious individuals, I've had to roll my eyes at some athletes immature clowning during a class. I've even seen two athletes violating the University academic honesty policy and try to use the tragic death of their teammate as an excuse. Why should I go to a Bradley game and cheer for individuals in which I've had negative experiences with on campus? ",

This survey is to gather feedback from Bradley students and Peorians on their demographics, preferences for an ideal hookah lounge, and views on smoking. This survey is about three minutes long. Please take this survey and share it with your Bradley and Peorian friends; by doing so, you are influencing if this happens and what it might look like if it does (please take it even if you don't/wouldn't smoke). We appreciate any and all feedback. Thank you so much.",

            "comment": "Hello. How are you? I am fine. I wanted a banana tree in my backyard (I eat several a day) so I got a banana and realized immediately that I have no idea where the seeds in a banana are located. They don't seem to have any seeds at all--though there is these black spots along the center spine of the fruit that seem incongruous. Rather than try and perhaps fail, I simply buried the entire banana (peel and all) in an area of soil that looked particularly rich (as rich soil will breed a rich fruit--that is what I've read). Nothing has happened yet, but I only planted it yesterday afternoon, so I'm trying not to get too discouraged. Good things are worth waiting for, wouldn't you say?",

Now, they (the bananas) are propegated through the use of clippings from other banana plants. I would not rate your chanced of getting a banana tree very highly.",

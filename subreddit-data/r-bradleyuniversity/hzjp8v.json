I\u2019m an intern for The 21st show that airs on five NPR member stations across Illinois.\n\nWe\u2019re doing a show tomorrow morning about students going back to campus, and what those implications may be.\n\nWe\u2019d like to hear the voices of a students who have an opinion on the matter. Consider these questions: What are your concerns going into the fall semester, if any? Do you feel safe going back to campus? Why or why not? How confident do you feel about people following public health guidelines on campus?\n\nPlease reach out if you would like to share your experience!",

            "comment": "I am a senior ME student.  I am very concerned about the pandemic.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am concerned for my professors.  From a superficial perspective, it's easy to see many would struggle if they contracted the virus.  I can count on one hand the number of ME professors I've had under the age of 60.  Many are obese.  At least a few are current or former smokers.  This isn't even considering their actual medical history or the conditions of their loved ones.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am concerned for the staff.  Many of them have conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus.  Many of the staff in the Mitchell Student Center smoke.  Same with the janitors who cleaned my dorm floor and the dorm bathrooms.  I'm sure they all will feel compelled to work, regardless of risk, out of financial need.  These are, again, superficial observations.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am incredibly underwhelmed by the university's response.  It was only the 23rd that they sent out applications for \"high risk\" professors to teach UP TO ONE of their classes online IF their application is approved by the dean and department chair.  They must submit the application by the 7th.  How absurd it is to say someone who fears for their life or that of their loved ones can drop one in person class IF the university thinks their fear is credible?  How absurd is it that in person classes have been planned since spring and only now they are asking professors if they have concerns about this?  I could ramble on about the myriad problems with attempting in person classes, though I think this example succinctly sums the university's abject failure to prepare for the upcoming semester.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want my personal, cynical take:  I see a university throwing caution to the wind in an attempt to preserve their cash flow.  They've told their students they will get the full in person 40k/year private college experience without any consideration of how to actually accomplish such a quixotic feat.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUniversities, like Harvard, that have a large enough balance sheet to put ethical considerations before fiscal ones have already cancelled in person classes.  It's truly upsetting to see how poorly Bradley has planned for the upcoming semester, and, in my opinion, shows a miserable ethical lapse on the part of the administration.  I plan on taking leave for the upcoming semester.  I wish the best for the students, faculty, and employees staying.",

I wish I was over in the engineering school teaching rational, logical students such as yourself.  We are all in a rush to return to normal, however we are willing to essentially throw caution to the wind by trying to reopen especially after last week.  Last week should have been the wakeup call we needed to make the right decision, but we are doubling down on teaching in person to hell with the consequences.\n\nI won't be surprised at all to see classes flip online after a mid semester outbreak and then all of the F2F planning will be rendered useless in a mere email from the president.  I'm somewhere in the middle of the pack in terms of risk, obviously I'd try to preserve some of the more immunocompromised professors from teaching in person but can a F2F semester possibly be a good experience?  We can't even have all of our students in a classroom safely for the majority of our classes.  I know of professors that have to split the class into thirds and alternate whom meets in person.  It's absolute madness and it's all but inevitable that tragedy will strike the hilltop at some point this fall.",

            "comment": "First off, congrats on getting accepted! Since the school is smaller, you can make friends with people from different majors/halls easily. Don't be afraid to go talk to people. Currently, classes are a bit squeezed in because the new building isn't finished, but that won't be a concern for you. \n\nCampus definitely feels alive during the day, if you look around and talk to people you will find there's plenty to do. there are plenty of clubs and organizations hosting events around campus. Greek life is a major part of Bradley campus, I'd encourage you to look into it, it's a great way to instantly know lots of people and be involved. Just use your judgement when deciding which group to join, you can always wait another semester/year. There are also specific fraternities/sororities dedicated to public service that don't do social stuff.\n\nAs far as dorms go, I would rank them from best to worst: Heitz, Williams, Geisert, Harper, Uhall, and Wyckoff, in that general order. None of the dorms are terrible/unlivable, they are old buildings that are relatively well maintained. Bradley has put a lot of money towards network infrastructure, and it has gotten better in the last few years. Still not perfect, but good enough.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask, I'm happy to help. I can also get some people in the nursing program if you have specific questions for them.",

The large uni vibe has its pros and cons, as the small uni vibe does. with a big school, there's gonna be more people, more stuff, more classes, more everything.if that's what you want, go for it. this school is not lacking in activities though, and i personally prefer the smaller university vibe as it means (among other things) typically smaller class sizes where you can get to know people/the professor better, easier to get around campus, less hordes of people everywhere, etc. when you plan your visit, make sure to do a tour on a visit day or one of the admitted senior days, the self-guided tour is not that good imo.",

I was living in Lovelace hall for a semester and every weekend raw sewage would spew into the basement bathroom from the first floor. And the other bathrooms would malfunction. The internet would also go out periodically. It was still a nice experience but I transferred out cause of the lack maintenance. The dinning halls have subpar food for my pallet but you might like their selection. All that to say the school isn't too bad but definitely not A+.",

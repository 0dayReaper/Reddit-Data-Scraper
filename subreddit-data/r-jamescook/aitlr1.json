            "comment": "\"Dear JCU faculty and staff,\n\tStop. Please just stop. If someone in your department, area, building or covered walkway has been charged with a sex offence, please do not provide them a character reference for court. To be clear, we do not have a good record on this, we\u2019ve now provided character references for two sex offenders and they\u2019ve been convicted regardless. So, yeah, it\u2019s not helping anyone \u2013 especially Chris Cocklin who always has to deal with the bad news. Like we have always asked, just keep your mouth shut, do your work and that of your colleague who we \u201creorganised\u201d away last year (or was that the year before?), and accept your paltry pay while we build a new picnic area for further sex offences to take place under.  \n\nAlso, whoever has taken the whole stack of JCU letterhead from the copier room in BLDG34, please return that.\n\nSincerely,\nSandra Hardon\"\n/s",

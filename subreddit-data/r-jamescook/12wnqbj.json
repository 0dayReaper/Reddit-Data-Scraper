    "postText": "Is an MBA worth it ??\n\nI graduated with a business degree in 2019 but I can't enter into the work force yet or do any of the graduate programs as I have had kids in the mean time. Iv got 2-3 years before all my children are school aged and I will be able to work then.... but instead of doing nothing significant towards my career while I wait I was considering post graduate studies... \n\nAlot of the time graduating within the last 5 years is relevant and by the time my kids are school age roughly 7 years will have passed... if I got an MBA or similar I would be a very relevant graduate come working time \u23f2\ufe0f \n\nThoughts? Advice? How do I make sure I'm able to get decent work in the future and stay relevant ? MBA? Other Masters??",

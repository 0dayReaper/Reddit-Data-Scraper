I see that the course is available in both the Townsville and the Cairns campus. Which one should I choose? (Take this from a perspective of an international student)\n\n2. Is the course worth it in general?",

            "comment": "the earth science area of the townsville campus is pretty old. I think the cairns campus science facilities are more up-to-date generally, though I can't speak for your course. no idea about the quality of staff at either campus, so can't help you decide there. as an international student, if you're planning to stay on campus, both townsville and cairns have some nice options, but townsville is definitely more compact/less spread out, so navigating is easy and so is getting to class on time if you live at a residence hall.",

    "postText": "**Looking for Participants in a Relationship!**\n\nI am currently looking for participants to take part in research for my Honours thesis at the University of New England.\n\nParticipants need to be 18 years or over, and in a romantic relationship of at least 3 months. The study consists of a short questionnaire, an activity for you to complete over the following three weeks, and then another short questionnaire. Some participants will be asked to complete a follow up questionnaire 2 months later.\n\nEach questionnaire is approximately 10 minutes. The intervention is approximately 20 minutes a week.\n\nParticipants will be asked to give their first name and email address in order to be sent the follow up questionnaires, this will be removed from the data once the study is complete in order to maintain anonymity.\n\nPlease contact me via email at cschult4@myune.edu.au for more information or questions you have regarding this study.\n\nTo access the study and for more information go to: http://unebcss.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_4O5LUlVbw4hL7nv\n",

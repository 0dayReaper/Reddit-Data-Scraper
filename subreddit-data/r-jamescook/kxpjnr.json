    "postText": "Hi I am from India and I plan to come there this year or next for my Masters in Marine Bio. Please let me know how the course is and if it is value for money as for international student the course is just insanely expensive. I also want to settle in Australia after that as there is literally no scope for Marine Biology in India. \nWould this be the right decision to make?",

Having continued studying elsewhere jcu is way better than some other places. And with the main office of the Australian institute of marine science and the great barrier Reef marine Park authority in Townsville there is opportunity to continue your career. \n\nI will also say that I know alot of passionate marine biologists who end up as dive instructors or working in the tourism industry cause there is not a huge market for hands on field based jobs. So not sure if you have thought about what you want to do with your degree yet ?",

    "postText": "So, I'll be moving to Townsville to attend James Cook from South Australia.\n\nI've accepted the offer and what not and am currently looking at the eStudent study plan details. I'm so mind fucked at the moment.\nTheres all this stuff about Cores, structures, options and I've got no idea what to look at or how to choose my courses or anything.\nI'll be doing Bachelor of Science (general) if that helps.\n\nAsking here because I'm assuming a majority of you have been through this whole process before.\n\nEdit: I've been looking in the 'My Study Plans' in eStudent. It has all this 'C', 'S', 'O' stuff and 'BSC-L2-COR-GRP1 - Select 3cp of subjects that correspond to your major'. I've been clicking stuff and seeing where it takes me. Some of them where it says 'choose' is straight forward, and others say it's a level 2 course... Is there anything I should just be focusing on?",

Only had a look at the one where it would affect my 2nd year major however that works.\n\nThe ones that I do this year were meant to be shaded purple, and they were the 2 core ones.\nThe other option ones I could choose weren't shade purple or anything...",

To look for classes go [here](https://secure.jcu.edu.au/app/studyfinder/). That first link that I sent has full instructions on choosing subjects for your course of study. If you run into any issues or have more specific questions, I'd say email the faculty. They would be more than willing to help you out. Cheers!",

I am part of a group of students researching the relationship between personality, mindfulness, and stress as part of our Bachelor of Psychology degree. **I\u2019m looking to get a wide population from all over Australia**. The study shouldn\u2019t take more than 10 minutes to complete. Once you finish it, you\u2019ll have the chance to go into the draw for one of 3 Coles Myer gift cards!\n\nFor more information: https://imgur.com/OHDGm4U\n\nLink to the study: bit.ly/PersonalityMindfulnessStress\n\nThank you and have a good day!",

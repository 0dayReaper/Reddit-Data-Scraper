I recently lost a very sentimental bracelet on one of the fields on JCU\u2019s Townsville campus; I have a pretty good idea of where it was lost. I was wondering if anybody had a metal detector that they would be willing to help me out with, or if anyone knew where I could borrow/rent one. I appreciate any help!",

            "comment": "Text if paywall:\n\n\"Marine scientist Peter Ridd has refused to accept a formal censure and gag order from James Cook University and expanded his Federal Court action to defend academic freedoms and free speech.\n\nA revised statement of claim alleges JCU trawled through private email conversations in a bid to bolster its misconduct case against him.\n\nJCU had found Professor Ridd guilty of \u201cserious misconduct\u201d, \u00adincluding denigrating a co-worker, denigrating the university, breaching confidentiality, publishing information outside of the university and disregarding his obligations as an employee.\n\nProfessor Ridd has asked the Federal Court to overturn the university ruling and confirm his right not to be silenced.\n\nIn the revised statement of claim, Professor Ridd has dropped an earlier claim of conflict of interest against JCU vice-chancellor Sandra Harding, but has alleged other senior staff had been biased and had not acted fairly or in good faith.\n\nProfessor Ridd\u2019s Federal Court action is seen as a test of academic freedom and free speech, and has been supported by the Institute of Public Affairs.\n\nProfessor Ridd said he would seek public donations to continue the fight against JCU. He first took court action in November in a bid to stop a JCU disciplinary process against him for comments he made to Sky News presenter Alan Jones.\n\nThe university said by expressing concerns about the quality of some reef science, Professor Ridd had not acted in a \u201ccollegiate\u201d manner.\n\nProfessor Ridd told Sky News: \u201cThe basic problem is that we can no longer trust the scientific \u00adorganisations like the Australian Institute of Marine Science, even things like the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies.\u201d\n\nHe said a lot of the science was not properly checked, tested or replicated and \u201cthis is a great shame because we really need to be able to trust our scientific institutions and the fact is I do not think we can any more\u201d.\n\nA JCU spokesman said the university\u2019s lawyers had invited Professor Ridd to discontinue his proceedings. \u201c(He) has amended his proceedings. His decision to do so is a matter for him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe university intends to vigorously defend those proceedings (but) as these matters are before the courts, JCU will not comment further.\u201d\n\nLawyers for JCU wrote to Professor Ridd on November 28 confirming the university had determined he had engaged in \u201cserious misconduct\u201d and issued him with a \u201cfinal censure\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe disciplinary process and all information gathered and recorded in relation to the disciplinary process (including the allegations, letters, your client\u2019s responses and the outcome of the disciplinary process) is confidential pursuant to clause 54.1.5 of the university enterprise agreement,\u201d the JCU lawyers said.\n\nProfessor Ridd has subsequently published his concerns about the quality of reef science in a peer-reviewed journal. He said he was determined to speak freely about his treatment \u201ceven though it will go against explicit directions by JCU not to\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is as much a case about free speech as it is about quality of science,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am very keen that the trawling of emails to dig up more dirt becomes known.\u201d\n\"",

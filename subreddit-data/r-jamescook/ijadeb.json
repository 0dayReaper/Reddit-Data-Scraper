    "postText": "G'day! Im now living in Thailand but planning to study master of social work in JCU in Feb next year. I have a few questions and hope JCU students can help advise :)\n\nFrom the course outline, there are some foundation subjects, but im not sure if they provide the basics of social work studies. Do teachers provide step-by-step counseling or interview workshops? Or they just give brief ideas? \n\nAre there still on/off-campus job opportunities in Townsville now that there's a covid-19 outbreak? As i heard from a few friends in Brisbane and Melbourne jobs are pretty difficult to find.\n\nSorry for a long post. Thanks y'all!",

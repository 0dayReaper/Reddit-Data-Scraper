    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am an international student from the USA looking for a change of scenery, which is why I am looking to obtain my Master's in Public Health and Tropical Medicine from the Land Down Under.\n\n1. Can you all tell me about JCU? How is the location of the Townsville location (are there things to do, is it diverse, etc.)?\n2. Are their funding opportunities for international postgraduate students?\n3. Would you recommend JCU or rather other universities in Australia or New Zealand? Why?\n\n  \nThanks in advanced for the help!",

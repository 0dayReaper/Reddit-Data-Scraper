    "postText": "If you don\u2019t want to read the whole post\u2026.\nShould I go to uni? I pretty much boycotted high school and don\u2019t know if ill handle it.\n\nHi redditors, im having a real struggle deciding weather or not university/college is right for me (im Australian, here we call it university)\u2026.Ill try and give you a quick breakdown on the past few years of my life and study\u2026\n\nHigh school \u2013 was not interested one bit, did basic maths, took wood working and grapic design as secondary subjects and did none or next to none of the assignments given to me. ( I drew a stick figure of ghandi in my history class and handed it in as an assignment, yay for peer pressure thought it was hilarious at the time)\n\nLast year of high school / 3 years out of school \u2013 started school-based apprenticeship at Toyota and finished my time as a tradesman (mechanic)\n\nLast 3 years of working career \u2013 Drillers offsider earning upwards of 50K+ a year, bad life decisions and now have a 50K vehicle and the rest of the money has been blown on god knows what, great life experience though do not regret one bit\u2026.\n\nNow im thinking that I want to go to university and study engineering (civil).. however im worried that because I never studied hard in school I just wont have the background and basic knowledge and skills to keep up to what everyone will expect of me, ie \u2013 basic maths I will struggle in, I have no physics study background, and I will struggle like anything with assignment because I simply have never done any in my life.... I am worried that I will go to uni and two or three months, or even a year or two down the track I will just stop being interested and there goes another period of my life wasted when I could have been earning real dollars. I am sick of doing the back breaking 12 hour days busting my ass and wrecking my body just to make a good dollar. (yes I know this sounds like a oh poor me, help me story, and I realize there are millions of people who would literally die just to have a job and earn a dollar a day)\n\nBasically im looking for some people to talk to, if you have been in the same situation or have any advice to give, how and why did you choose university?\u2026I am happy to have a phonecall or a skype call with someone\u2026.and with qtac applications closing soon (Australian university) I don\u2019t have a lot of time left to decide weather or not to go to uni starting this febuary coming, if I miss this dead line it wont be until mid year that I can apply again\u2026\n\nThanks for taking the time to read.\n",

            "comment": "Mate, I am in the same boat. I dropped out in yr 10 ('05) and fuddled around for a couple of years before completing an electrical apprenticeship. Now I'm 25 and think I want to study again. I have no fucking idea how the Uni system works or whether the courses I'm looking at will get me into the job I think I want. I hated High School with a passion and had 100+ absent days in both years 9 and 10 (not to mention the countless individual lessons missed).\n\nI found studying for my apprenticeship easy, as it was something I enjoyed. I believe (hope) Uni will be the same. Otherwise I'm just a useless person with a qual I don't want to use. I actually hate domestic/commercial/industrial electrical work - I worked in a very niche field and left my previous employer (almost the only employer in aus in the field) on really bad terms so there's no hope of getting back into the field of electrical I do enjoy. \n\nI think we need to find career advisors, but I don't know where to start and doubt I could properly convey to one what I want out of life/uni.\n\n",

            "comment": "As I understand there are year long diploma courses you can take(they basically consist of a mixed bag of subjects that loosely relate to engineering or whatever you wish to get into) so that you can demonstrate that you are capable of higher learning despite a low/missing OP score. This would probably be a good opportunity to scope out whether or not university is for you or not as well.\n\nEngineering has a maths bridging course as well(MA1020) which should bring you up to speed with high school mathematics - assuming you have a grade 10 level of competency in it.\n\nI think you can be enrolled for a few weeks(until the census date) without having to pay for the subjects, but you might want to ask someone about that.",

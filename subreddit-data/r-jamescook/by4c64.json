    "postText": "Hi all,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just recently got an interview for JCU Australia's medical school as an international student taking the IB. As such I have several questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. For all past successful international applicants: how was the interview like? What types of questions did they ask in general?\n2. Compared to high school (IB) how hard is JCU med school; like what is the first day like, and what are the classes like in terms of work load and teaching (are the classes big/overwhelming? Lots of homework and studying?)\n\nSorry for all the questions. My interview is coming up on the 14th of June, and im really nervous",

As I am from Australia, I can\u2019t help with the first question but I can certainly help with questions surrounding workload!\n\nFor your first year you\u2019ll learn about the basic types of cells and their functions, the metabolic processing of glucose, the endocrine system, anatomy and physiology of muscles, the reproductive system, genetics and a host of ethical and cultural issues in medicine.\n\nFrom my conversations with international students I believe that there is quite a large crossover of knowledge from these classes and your high school classes (especially glucose metabolism).\n\nThere is a larger workload than high school but it is definitely manageable. Something that I\u2019ve noticed is that many students who found high school easy didn\u2019t do as well at uni because they think they can get away with doing no work. The workload is definitely manageable as long as you work at it piece by piece and don\u2019t slack off.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much homework in the course, it\u2019s more just however you want to study. The classes are broken into 4 lectures (1 hour each) where you are given the content for the week, 4 Guided Learning Sessions (varies from 1 - 3 hours each depending on the week) where you complete questions with tutors available for questions and finally 4 Synthesis Sessions (1 hour each) in which the lecturer covers common questions or additional content. Each week there are also 1 or 2 additional lectures surrounding particular diseases or issues or even mindfulness.\n\n\nAlso, for your interview my advice would be to relax and just talk with the interviewers. They aren\u2019t looking for extremely knowledgeable candidates, they want personable doctors who would be able to have a conversation with the patient.\n\n\nSorry for the word dump! Hope it helps.",

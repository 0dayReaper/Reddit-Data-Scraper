    "postText": "Hi, 2 months ago I decided that I should change my life and study for a degree. I want to go for B.S Engineering at JCU but first I need an extra year to get my Diploma of Higher Education. My problem is that I am getting anxiety because I am not so sure if my academic abilities are up for it.\n\nI finished high school 9 years ago and pretty much forgotten everything I learned from there. Not even the basic knowledge of math, physics and chemistry.\n\nHowever I do remember that I was really fascinated by physics even though my math skills required to supplement it are dreadful. We're talking about not being able to add/subtract fractions, convert units from one to another. I was a terrible student. But I really liked the theory behind them, like what quantity is directly/inversely proportional to another, or how light rays bounces off a concave/convex mirror. \n\nWith that in mind, at the same time I decided that I'm going to Uni next year, I started teach myself math from scratch. In 2 months, I learned algebra. From solving 1 step linear equations, inequalities, systems of equations, logarithms, functions,  up to solving quadratic equations by factoring, completing the square and by formula. Then I breezed through geometry which I think is the easiest. I also just started trigonometry(trigonometric functions, identities and unit circle coordinates). \n\nAfter diving into a bit of math I realized that I now know more math than science. I'm not sure if I should continue learning math up to calculus for the remaining months before the first semester, or I should stop after a bit of trigonometry and start learning physics/chemistry. \n\nI currently work full time from 8-4pm and I only have a couple of hours a day to study so I want to make sure I am self-studying the right subject. Atleast until my work schedule changes once the first study period commences.\n\nNote that the Diploma of Higher Education has, preparatory physics, chemistry and math. I don't know if the sciences there will be taught from the ground up( starting from structure of an atom, speed,velocity density,etc).\n\nI know my best bet is to talk to a staff from JCU but I just want to hear your opinions.",

            "comment": "Hey man, I did B.Engo for a few years before switching over to B.Ed. Basically through the diploma of higher education you'll easily be able to deal with the maths and science that comes with an engineering degree. It scales up really well and everything builds on something else and if you do the introductory maths subject you'll be easily be able to handle the first engineering maths subject and since they all build from there you'll be fine.\n\nBest of luck mate",

            "comment": "I started out doing a B. Eng at JCU (ended up changing after 2 years, but I think my experience is still similar). In high school, the only relevant subjects I took were Maths B (2nd highest level) and Chem. No physics, no higher math. First year of engineering is largely getting everyone up to speed on (somewhat basic) maths, physics, and chemistry principles. In your first year you will take a good amount of physics and maths, and one chem course. The chemistry course is largely designed for people with no background in chemistry whatsoever, but it is more geared towards engineering principles than chemistry principles. The physics courses I found a bit more difficult, as I had only a minor background in it (Grade 8-10 science - *really* basic physics), but I still managed to get through OK.\n\nThe science courses in the Diploma of Higher Ed will be taught as though you have absolutely no prior knowledge of the material whatsoever. You may find that these will be a little bit of repetition of what you already know (especially for the maths by the sound of it), but the physics and chemistry may be helpful. If you want any more info on the preparatory chemistry course, feel free to DM me",

The latter is probably better, as it covers both a *very* introductory level, as well as some more advanced chemistry",

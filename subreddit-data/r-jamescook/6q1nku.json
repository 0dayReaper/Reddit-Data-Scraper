I would be really grateful if you would be able to do my survey. You will be asked to imagine yourself at a community event and then answer questions (on a scale, such as 1 = not at all to 7 = very much) about your beliefs, feelings and intentions. It should take 20 minutes and you would really be helping me out. Just click on the link below and it will take you to the survey. Your responses will be completely anonymous and you can withdraw at any time. Your participation will also make you eligible to go into a prize draw for one of three $20 vouchers.\n\nhttps://exp.psy.uq.edu.au/socialengagement/community",

    "postText": "Hey r/jamescook -\n\nI am so sorry if you have seen this very same post on r/cairns and r/townsville, but I am begging you to do us a MASSIVE favour and text \"JCU\" to 0417 666 397. This is not spam and will only cost a standard text charge (if you're with Optus, I think it's free). People who text do not need to be from JCU or even a uni student. Again, this will not subscribe you to anything - it is just for the competition runners to count the amount of texts!\n\n[link to the convention webpage](http://un.convention.al/)\n[link to the competition](http://un.convention.al/#section-competitions)\n\nWhy should I do this, Australian_Psycho?\nIt's for a competition between medical schools. The med school that gets the most people to text JCU to 0417 666 397 gets an extra 10 registrations the the AMSA (Australian Medical Students Association) Convention.\nI know it doesn't sound like much, but registration for 1500 people often sells out in 2 minutes. Since JCU is quite small and unknown (compared to everyone else), it would be awesome to win this challenge - getting not only an extra 10 registrations but also being better known to other unis.\nI know this is asking a bit much, but it'd be awesome for some support!\n\nThank you so much - Again, sorry for the huge wall of text + posting this everywhere.",

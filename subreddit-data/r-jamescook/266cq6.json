    "postText": "Hey guys! \n\nI'm in first year doing BoSci and want to transfer into Vet next year so I'm trying to get a good GPA.\n\nWhen you get your results as HD, D, C etc. do they bell curve the results, so if you're top of the class and on an 80 you still get an HD or if you're on an 80 do they not bell curve it and just give a distinction?\n\nI'm doing CH1001 and BM1000, from what I've heard their exams are hell, worried how much they'll pull me grade down.\n\nCheers!",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I am potentially coming to study at JCU for med next year (fingers crossed for an offer!!) and was just curious if there are many people hanging around on residence on the weekends, particularly at uni hall which is where I'd be staying. If I went to JCU I'd be a several hour plane ride away so I would be hanging around res most weekends. Would I get lonely? I know some unis are dead on the weekends but I thought that since there are quite a few internationals and other med students that would be from interstate, that there should be some people to chill with. Any thoughts or experiences?",

People live there and really only go home over lecture recess and swotvac.  You will be living with 300 people for the whole semester.\n",

    "postText": "As an international prospective student in the midst of searching up on how australian universities work, practically speaking, i'm really interested to know if it's possible to do a flexible dual degree *and* a minor at the anu? Like are there students who've actually had such a combination before, or maybe something like a major and double minor? Or is that academic overkill lol",

            "comment": "It depends on what degree your doing. But if the degree would normally have u doing majors and minors then yes, you still do them. Double degree tend to work by basically eliminating most of your electives so if your minor/major is within your degree which most are then you will still be doing them. Hope that helps :)",

I had a minor in my flexible double but it was caused by an administrative error by CASS (an academic advised me to take a class saying I was eligable when it turned out I wasn't. You should check with the college that administers the potential degree.",

In fact, a language minor is included in an bachelor of international relations anyways, but my main point is that it isn\u2019t likely unless your degrees have enough classes that can count as credits to BOTH degrees. \nOr if you do a degree that includes a minor, as I mentioned with international relations having a language minor, but the same applies to Bachelors of Arts and other encompassing degrees that break down into minors regardless.",

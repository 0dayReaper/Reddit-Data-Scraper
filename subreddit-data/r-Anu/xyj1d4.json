    "postText": "I recently applied to Fenner hall for accommodation and I was just wondering if anyone would be able to answer some questions I had about the kitchens in fenner. \n\nFirstly is there allocated storage for the students in the kitchen, and is this storage allocated automatically or will I have to apply to get some storage? Also does this storage extend to the fridges?, as I had heard some buildings allocated lockable fridge tubs for you but I wasnt sure if this was in place at fenner. \n\nSecondly are the kitchens as bad as some people say, and if so does this mostly come from the quality of the kitchens or the fact that they get crowded as they are too small for the number of residents?\n\nThanks!",

There are also some shelves you can put your things in around the kitchen. \n\nIt can get a little crowded, especially near meal times, but if you are clever about your cooking time it's not too bad. Problem is people leaving the space dirty and not cleaning up after themselves.",

I don't really need one so I don't have one. If I ever need to put something in a fridge but keep it closer than the kitchens are, I use the lounge fridge",

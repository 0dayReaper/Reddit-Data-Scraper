I figured that in my case, it wasn't worth the extra $175 a week to have meals cooked for me, since at the moment my current food budget is barely $50 a week, with takeaway and coffee factored in.\n\nIf you get good at meal prepping, self-catered can save you a lot of money, and if your hall has shared kitchens like mine does, you'll still have a decent social experience since you'll see people when you cook.",

There's one kitchen for the whole hall from what I know, so you'll definitely see people in there. I'm a postgrad so I don't know that much about the undergrad halls, so maybe someone on here who's lived at B&amp;G can weigh in.\n\nAs for catered in the first year, that one's up to you. With self-catered, you'll still see your neighbours around, so unless you're at Unilodge, you should still have decent socialising opportunities while not paying way more for mediocre food at set times. It really depends what you value and how much that extra $170ish is worth to you.",

I had the convenience of just rocking up to the dining hall and eating (at the cost of ~25/day), where you had to spend the time to buy and prepare meals. People can argue for or against, but imo it comes down to personal preference. \n\nHowever, If you're a fussy eater or have dietary requiements, i always recommend self-catered",

You also dont have flexibility in what is served.\n\nIMO catered colleges have a better overall social experience as you're forced to dine together as a college.",

    "postText": "I recently started at ANU under the subclass 500 student visa. I was planning on overloading my cousework next semester so I could get as many courses as I reasonably could during my masters program but I was told I'm only limited to the 72 hours of my visa. Does anyone know if there's a workaround here? I'd love to take some extra courses but I'm limited by this damn visa.",

            "comment": "If you want to take more courses simply because you want to learn more material, you can ask the lecturer to let you audit courses beyond the usual 4.  This gives you full access to all course materials, and often will allow you to attend tutorials.  Most lecturers will not mark any assessments you do, but they would usually provide some feedback if you go to their office hours.  It's important to note that audited courses will not appear on your transcript, and will not count toward your degree.  They are free though, so that's nice.  It is also at the lecturer's discretion whether they allow you to audit the course, but typically lecturer's are happy to have an extra body in the room.\n\nIf you're looking to take more courses to finish your degree more quickly, that's much more difficult.  You might be able to find a workaround, but I don't know of any.",

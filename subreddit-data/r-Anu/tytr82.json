I'm a prospective international freshman at ANU and was wondering if the school does keep to their deadlines of getting back to students on the first of each month (e.g, if you apply in March, you'd get a reply back on April 1). Does not hearing back from them = no hopes in getting in, then?",

By the offer release date, they will send you a notification regardless of whether your application is accepted or not. If you don\u2019t hear back from them by that day then there might be an administrative error. I suggest getting in touch with them directly.",

I honestly would, but I applied through an agent and I'm not sure if he/she has been entirely transparent with me throughout this process (e.g., submitting documents past the deadline without informing me). I'll probably wait it out some more then contact them if need be!",

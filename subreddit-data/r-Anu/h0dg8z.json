    "postText": "Hey everyone, I recently received a conditional offer for the PhD program in the Research School of Social Science (Poli Sci and IR). This is a bit of a long one, but in brief I had wanted to apply for scholarships in the U.S., but my decision was delayed by ~5 weeks and I couldn\u2019t apply without a conditional offer. Flash forward to the scholarship round at ANU and I was told there are plenty of funding opportunities for international students (I\u2019m from the U.S.) which put me at ease. However, because I didn\u2019t complete my Bachelor\u2019s until late May, they told me after the fact that I was not competitive for admission even though I had given them all of my information. They explicitly said this was because I had not yet completed my qualification, which would have been nice to know BEFORE lodging my application and trying to locate funding. Now they\u2019re saying I have to wait to apply for more scholarships until September despite the fact that the tuition fee scholarship is listed as being open all year in addition to other means of funding. I\u2019m totally baffled at why financial aid is being managed this way, especially since I couldn\u2019t apply at home because of how delayed my application was. Also, because the census date for Semester 2 is before the scholarship round for September, I would essentially have to gamble $20,000 USD just to enroll with no guarantee of future funding. I have never seen a university\u2019s financial aid system function like this, and I\u2019ve not received much help from the administration finding a way through. Any help would be super appreciated!",

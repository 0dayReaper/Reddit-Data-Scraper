    "postText": "I am currently waiting for the result of the accommodation (and the date when I can move in) before booking the flight ticket. However, it seems that few have received the accommodation outcome yet. Seeing that flight ticket around the 11-13 Feb period is already high now, I am wondering if I should book the flight ticket now (and risk not having a place to stay when I arrive, lol) or continue to wait for the accommodation result.",

Accommodations are rolled out gradually well into Week 1 of the semester. So, waiting for an accommodation offer before you travel isn't recommended. In case you don't get an offer before your intended date of travel, there's a youth hostel in the city, airbnbs, etc. that you can stay at. If it helps you could send an email to Accommodations letting them know of your travel plan and that you'd appreciate getting an offer before then. \n\n\nMore importantly, if you are a Postgrad/higher student, there is no accommodation guarantee, so keep looking for apartments/sharehouses as well.",

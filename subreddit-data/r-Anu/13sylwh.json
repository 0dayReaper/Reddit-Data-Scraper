The guarantee applies to all first years, just try to stay up to date on any future communications and contact the university early if things start falling apart.",

If you miss the basic initial communications and others do not and they get their applications in by the cut off date, you may be looking at alternate accommodation. Personally, I paid attention to those who paid attention and had the appropriate paperwork in on time...I was not paid to be your secretary and remind you. SHEESH!! What is happening with the world!??!!",

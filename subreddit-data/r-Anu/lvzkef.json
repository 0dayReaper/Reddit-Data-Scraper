    "postText": "I'm a first year undergrad completing the research science degree and am looking to focus my studies on computer science and maths. I chose my elective to be BUSN1001 since I thought it might aid me in the future in understanding how an IT business could run (with accounting etc) and the world in general a bit better.\n\nHowever, so far, BUSN1001 has been very dry, with lots of definitions and jargon (I have had no experience with business before). I know it lays the foundations for accounting, but it seems very content and memorisation heavy. My friends are currently taking BUSN1001 and FINM1001 at the same time claim FINM1001 is way more engaging. Looking at the stock market, in my opinion, does sound more engaging! An issue is that I have to be taking a STAT course alongside it, but I'm hoping I can ask for permission to take it given I already covered a lot of the STAT1008 content in Year 12.\n\nBasically, I don't think I will be minoring in business or finance, so I don't think I'm really considering job prospects. But, I'd like to pick a course which will enable me to learn more about the world, become more financially literate, and maybe be useful if I work in a corporate/commercial environment. I have heard finance gets more content heavy/broader conceptually in later years whereas accounting really narrows down onto the details and is more calculation based, but at the moment, it seems they are the other way around! I would prefer a less memorisation/content-heavy pathway. I have also heard it's not unheard of to get into finance with an accounting background, but it's harder the other way around.\n\nGiven this info, and from your experiences, which out of BUSN1001 or FINM1001 would you recommend?",

Very engaging course, lovely lecturer, and easy marking. You can easily ace it if you had a good grip of high school maths.\n\nBUSN1001 is straight-up accounting, and putting numbers into a cell and making sure things add up. It\u2019s good enough to do but not very kind to those lacking interest + time to practice. Super easy tho, exams are straightforward and again, you can get 100% in the course. \n\nDM me if you need more guidance.",

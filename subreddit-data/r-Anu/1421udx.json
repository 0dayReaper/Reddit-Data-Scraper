A lot of Australians don\u2019t in the general pop). But they\u2019re still very popular degrees (esp compsci, know quite a few compsci people).

There\u2019s also a stronger focus on project management then maybe some other universities. I am doing the renewable energy systems major and i really enjoyed it. But it is more high level and less theoretical than some other degrees. So I\u2019m thinking of doing masters at a different uni such as UNSW or Wollongong to improve on my electrical knowledge. Something to consider. \n\nI\u2019ve heard computer science is better taught than engineering at ANU but thats not my opinion as I don\u2019t do computer science (from people who did both). \n\nI think campus life and extracurriculars are great at ANU. Very cool student projects in engn",

So if you're considering science it's up there. It is among the best for law and political sciences too, alongside Usyd and unimelb.\n\nComputer Science at ANU is also excellent, and 4 computer science degrees are offered. There's BSc in Computer Science, Advanced Computing, Advanced Computing R&amp;D, and Software Engineering. \n\nANU computer science emphasises theory and rigour, although there are practical courses in software engineering and development. \n\nFrom what I've heard however it isn't particularly renowned for engineering.",

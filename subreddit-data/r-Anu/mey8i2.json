    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm currently a year 12 student doing early admissions. I want to do actuarial studies, but what would be the best back up plan that makes it possible to switch to actuarial studies later on? I'm assuming Commerce, accounting or finance. But not sure which one. What do you guys think?\n\nedit: maybe even a maths degree would be suitable?",

They are on track to get an ATAR  of 80 which gets them into enough courses they want to do.  \n\nHow\u2019s ANU for younger kids? How are they with supporting students with ADHD?\n\nMy current idea is that they can do a \u201cfun\u201d degree first, and then when 19 can go and do a second, more serious degree once they work out what they want to do.  Would this work?",

            "comment": "I'd worry about the social side of things a little, if only in terms of the fact that a lot of club/society events involve drinking/going out etc., as well as the bar on campus. I read that you're from canberra so I'd presume they have a support network in other aspects of life (extracurriculars etc.) but nonetheless I'd be wary on those grounds (and imo the difference in maturity, intelligence aside, of a 16 year old and 18 year old). I'd recommend looking around at the campus life activities at the kind of things your kid would be interested in and what kind of vibe you get from them. \n\nIn terms of your \"fun degree\" \"serious degree\" plan, I'd be cognisant of the HECS-HELP limit (unlikely to meet unless your kid does 2 higher student contribution band degrees and fails a fair few units, but worth being aware of). [https://www.studyassist.gov.au/help-loans/combined-help-loan-limit](https://www.studyassist.gov.au/help-loans/combined-help-loan-limit) As well, the student entitlement to CSP ([https://www.studyassist.gov.au/help-loans-commonwealth-supported-places-csps/student-learning-entitlement](https://www.studyassist.gov.au/help-loans-commonwealth-supported-places-csps/student-learning-entitlement)) means that with your plan, presuming 2x 3yr degrees, your child would only be eligible for one more year of CSP learning after the \"serious degree\". This could be problematic if they wanted to do something based on the second degree in a post-grad setting. (Non-CSP postgrad studies can be very expensive)",

Papers get graded with student numbers (not names) and tutorials don't really focus on individuals too much. In large courses they aren't even marked by the tutor of the class students are in. To be honest, I may have very well had a 16 year old in my classes but I never would have known. \n\nA question that you may want to ask yourself is how will a pass average affect your child's ability to apply for their secondary 'serious' degree? Once you have a UG degree, that is counted far more highly towards future applications than an ATAR and a P average will cause some serious issues if your child wants to undertake a competitive PG (or even UG) degree. Particularly if you are thinking along the lines of medicine, law, pharmacy or optometry, a P average will tank their chances of entry. \n\nCould I suggest reaching out to the [ANU Future Student Enquiry Team](https://www.anu.edu.au/contact-anu/future-student-enquiry) to talk about potential options or issues that you're concerned about? I would explicitly mention your plan re: initial degree with a PG plan.",

It'll give them some time to earn a little money, maybe travel, and experience some independence before heading into university at the same age as their peers. Some work experience under their belt will likely be more valuable in the long run than an initial \"fun\" degree.\n\nAs others have said, going in at 16 will likely present some obstacles to fully engaging in social activities.",

I then started uni the following year, and even then I feel was too early for me to start. I wish I had taken a gap year or had gotten some more life experience prior to beginning my first bachelor degree. It would have saved the confusion of which area I wanted to pursue further in my studies. I ended up swapping between degrees and taking some time off to move overseas, still not knowing what I wanted to study. The lack of an end goal career wise really impacted my ability to engage with University work. I would not recommend starting a degree for the sake of studying, if your child would like the intellectual challenge then perhaps gaining experience through volunteering or work, while completing single units in University studies for the intellectual challenge. \nEmotional maturity is most definitely something you should consider for your child entering University. \nPerhaps they can enrol in another year of year 12 (maybe even at a different school), and complete University subjects then too, just to get an idea what it's like and if they feel up to it, or to inspire them. I must also express that even though you do not wish to dictate what path your child follows, I would like to encourage you to consider the impact it will have on them emotionally late down the line. Especially considering the fact that they are indeed only a child, and what they want to do now, they might not see as being the best decision later in life.",

Also, the financial burden of a first fun degree is not negligible, especially if he doesn't plan to use it for much.

I was really ready to go to uni and no other option appealed to me but going young does have some costs primarily socially. If they want to get involved with clubs etc they may find themselves unable to take part in various events or feeling a bit on the outside of them not being able to drink. That being said I am meeting more and more people who don't drink, and non alcoholic beer etc are a great way to feel included without actually participating, and there are lots of social activities that don't involve alcohol.   \n\n\nIf your child is passionate about a career path or an area of study and there is nothing else that appeals to them then that passion and drive would be worth coming to ANU early. If they just want the uni experience though and they don't really have clear goals in mind I would recommend against it. Doing two degrees is a very long time to be studying, let alone if they want to do something postgrad too. Particularly having ADHD they may feel very burnt out from that duration of study, stress and deadlines and may not have the energy and drive left to do the degree that will help them in the career they really want.",

As  academics, we have a duty-of-cae to assist under-age students, but we really cannot control outside of the classroom.   Some subjects, such as genocide studies or law courses that deal with crime, need a certain level of maturity.   Maintaining a good GPA is important, especially if postgraduate studies or an application for study of a 2nd degree is considered by ANU\n\nI do not know much about UC, but there are a lot of Canberra-based students who attend there.  It is a good school and might not have the academic pressures of ANU.    A second year at a good college might also help to raise his ATAR.\n\nSome degree programs are offered online and might be an option to consider.   I am from the US, where there are options to take university-level courses as a secondary school student.  That is something while I was in secondary school and it helped me to mature and grow. I would suggest consulting with an educational counsellor to potentially explore options.   Whether it's at CIT or an online set of offerings, there are a number of possibilities for finding a topic that suits your child.\n\nOn medical issues, I would suggest speaking with Access and Inclusion at ANU.    I cannot speak for all academic staff, but we take accomodations seriously.   I am not aware of accomodations leading to discrimination at ANU, but there are procedures in place to address these issues if they arise (including criminal referrals if necessary).   There is a general view that students are diverse and it is important to accommodate different needs that is different from what I observed a generation ago in tertiary education.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm considering attending ANU next year and was just wondering if anyone could tell me a little bit about studying there and if they enjoy it, particularly the overall vibe/friendliness of the university. I am considering a double of International Relations/International Security Studies. \n\nI'm also looking at on campus accomodation. I can't afford the catered colleges but I was particurly looking at Burton &amp; Garran Hall, Fenner Hall or Wamburun Hall as less expensive alternatives, or potentially Kinloch Lodge or Lena Karmel Lodge but are less certain about the latter. If anyone has stayed in these accommodations, or has had experience with them I'd love to hear about it, and what they are like, as well as the the pros &amp; cons. \n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "An International Relations/International Security Studies double will have a lot of overlap. A lot of the IR compulsory courses are electives in IS and vis versa and, as you can't count one course for both degrees, you'll be limiting your options considerably. General consensus is that IS is the better choice if you're more into the practical side and IR for the theoretical side. Both are very solid at ANU. Maybe look at adding something else in a double (Law, Commerce, Public Policy, PPE, Political Science, Development Studies and the various languages are all options that could work in a double with IR/IS). -- a Law/IS student.",

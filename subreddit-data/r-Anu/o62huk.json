None of the courses required for the specialisation specify any math/stats courses besides MATH1115 (or MATH1014). Would I be at a disadvantage if I had not taken any stats courses before doing the ML courses? If so, what maths/stats courses should I take to prepare myself for the ML specialisation?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

That is the ultimate cure to any course from the beginning. I also didn't know anything about computers prior to starting, and the learning curve was steep but now my life is better for learning.",

            "comment": "Honestly, you might have it easier than some people who have done programming before since the Adv Comp course in first semester (COMP1100/1130) uses Haskell which is very different to the procedural languages many people learn with like JS, Java, C#, Python etc. - so you will be able to start fresh with functional programming then pick up procedural programming (the easier of those two paradigms for sure) in the second semester with relative ease. And if you have a decent mathematical background that will help too with the first semester course.",

            "comment": "When it comes to work-life balance, it is worthwhile favouring the study at the start.   Get yourself organised, so you aren\u2019t pulling all-nighters trying to get stuff finished to deadline.  So be strict with yourself about when you will work on your tasks and stick to it. Then you can relax a bit once you have got the hang of the routine and know that you have the aptitude.  Honestly with programming and design stuff, some people just get it and others struggle.  My predictors are logical, detailed thinking, but also an ability to visualise something that isn\u2019t there.    I always felt the best predictor was reading sci fi and fantasy, but asking people what they read isn\u2019t a permitted interview question.",

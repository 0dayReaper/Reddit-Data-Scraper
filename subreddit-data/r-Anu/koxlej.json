Since it was moved on campus its become wildly expensive in return for things being \"new\", but all the facilities are less than the old building. The kitchens are so incredibly small that you can't even fit a half of the Hall in them at prime cooking time, the laundry is now paid in addition to rent, rather than as a part of rent, the community spaces are tiny, and most of the furniture in the community spaces was chosen because it \"looked good\" rather than for comfort or praticality (gotta love architects, hey...). Since then, with the massive rent increase (2019 saw a $60-70 rent increase if I recall correctly, the Hall culture died and the Hall changed entirely. Fenner stopped being a \"you do you\" Hall and just went the way of being another drunken haven of Sydney and Melbourne private school kids. Honestly, the only big difference it has from places like Bruce, Wright, Johns, and Burgmann nowadays is that its self-catered.",

The culture is generally very lacking on the social side, there's always some who say otherwise, but I've met a LOT of people who have said its horrible, and know plenty of people who've transferred out or tried to at least. It also practices prohibition, which leads to EXTREMELY dangerous drinking practices, and I've heard some horrible stories about the Senior Residents over the years, including revealing residents' private problems to their friends for a laugh.",

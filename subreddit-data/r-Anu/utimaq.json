    "postText": "I found ANU anthropology ranks quite high on QS anthropology subject ranking and the field study courses interest me a lot. \nI am applying to transfer to ANU from a liberal arts college in the U.S. because we don\u2019t have a lot of classes like zero on southeast asian studies and few on anthropology.\nSo I am wondering if anyone has taken anthropology classes or field study classes and willing to share some insights?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a master of anthropology student at ANU and I am in my final semester. I came from Europe to this university in Australia because I also wanted to be more exposed to Southeast Asian studies during my anthropology studies. The anthropology department and program is undergoing a lot of changes at the moment. The master program has shrunk from 2  years to 1 year, many professors left, and there are courses which content is totally different from what it says on their course summary page.  I definitely feel like ANU will descend on the world ranking for anthropology. If it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll have learnt to not factor in these rankings ever again when searching for a good uni. I do feel that I could\u2019ve better studied anthropology elsewhere and paid waaaay less for tuition. That being said, I do have a positive experience in terms of community at ANU. But when it comes to academics, I\u2019m not quite convinced that it is worth the tuition fees.",

            "comment": "Most Aus unis are very similar if not the same. The difference in quality as between them is minimal (most good academics jump between them all). The only two that are 'kind of' different are USyd and UMelb as they are more 'traditional' quasi-collegiate unis.\n\nUni rankings pretty much mean nothing here (and are only relevant to arguments between secondary schoolers). Unless you're looking at post grad, don't bother with rankings. Focus on campus life, location, courses of interest etc. If you're set on prestige and rankings, go to Oxbridge or the Ivy League or choose one of the Times Top 20 (you can skip Aus pretty much entirely, they are on a different level over there). \n\nPersonally, I'd choose ANU over UNSW. Mainly because I'm bias but also because of the location and proximity to the city, and recent infrastructure upgrades.  BUT it's Canberra... (unfortunately it can get v boring here. It's about two decades away from a big city vibe). That said, cannot go wrong with either of the two. They are essentially the same uni just in different locations. One has a boomerang on its shield. One has a lion. UNSW has waaay more (like annoying level of) stairs. ANU has more ducks. UNSW builds buildings towards the sky. ANU is generally more spread out (this is progressively changing though).",

Close to Sydney and the snow. If you don't care for the 'big smoke' CBR is the place. Has enough facilities and infrastructure to get by. And the Arboretum is a great way to fill the boring void... Connect with nature and all that hippie stuff.\n\nIt is, however, filled to the brim with public servants... unfortunately. The people can also be very friendly, but also overly sensitive (compared to the cities where everyone is unfriendly and insensitive lol)",

            "comment": "Hi there! I am an ANU student so obviously I am biased but I love ANU. As a science student I have found the quality of teaching to be really high and had access to a lot of support throughout my degree (I am now doing a PhD at ANU). ANU also has a first year uni accomodation guarantee so If you are worried about finding accomodation, that can take some of the stress away. As for Canberra, while it is not a big city by any means I think it is an extremely liveable city. It is very quick to get around, you can walk to the centre of the city from ANU in 15 minutes, it has good cafes and restaurants and beautiful nature around. It is also a short bus ride to Sydney if you want to get a bit of the big city experience. Would there be any chance you could visit Australia and the Uni's to see what would suit you better before you move here?",

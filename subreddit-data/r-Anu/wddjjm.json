    "postText": "So I joined anu for semester 2, and I am a bit confused with the degree structure since I do bachelor of economics. Every semester requires me for 4 courses of which 2 are compulsory so 6 units each. Apart from ECON1101  and STAT1008, I also have BUSN 1001 (list 1) and FINM1001 (University wide,but list 1:/). Now, is it necessary to do courses like ECH1006 (from list 1courses) for this semester or I can complete this semester with the course I have and choose ECH1006  in the next semester?",

On top of that you need to do 3 'List 1' courses and 3 'List 2' courses.  \n\nThe courses you've chosen for this semester will work great.  You can leave worrying about your other courses until later if you want.",

    "postText": "hey, so I am a prospective student at ANU who is thinking of doing PPE/IR double degree. Can I get some really honest reviews on the both of them combined or single as I haven't confirmed yet? I've read some critical reviews of the PPE degree at ANU which has gotten me real paranoid lmao so please let me know if this combination is good or not.",

            "comment": "I'm in my first year of PPE/IR. IR has been fantastic - super interesting and very fun. I have still found PPE enjoyable, but not to the same extent - I haven't really clicked with philosophy specifically. The crossover between the two hasn't been bad at all, at least in first sem.\n\nAs mentioned by others though, I'm not sure how helpful PPE is actually going to be after I finish? I chose it as more of a supplement to my IR and put less thought into planning it out and I'm now regretting that a bit.  I've been thinking of switching PPE out with arts or something around economics so that I can actually major in something more specific. \n\nIf you plan it out and look at all the courses you'll do over the next few years and think that that's exactly what you find interesting and cool then I would think it would be fine. It's definitely still an interesting degree, but if you want to come out of it with super specific knowledge/gain qualifications in specific areas of economics or philosophy etc then it would be best to focus on one of them individually.",

Personally I would recommend International Security over IR - it's a lot more focused on the more practical side of IR, such as crisis resolution and the state of the world today moving forward. However, it is very much based around the Australian perspective, and I am biased since I am doing the degree.",

Unfortunately that is a very slow process.\n\nANU, ANUSA, ISD, can try and push for international students return, but at a higher level that doesn't fit into the government's conservative/protectionist agenda. Mind you it's a federal election year. If quarantine systems fail, be it those hosted by the ANU or ACT, it will look bad for the federal government.\n\nHave a read of https://anuobserver.org/2021/04/24/anus-international-students-their-stories/ , https://www.sbs.com.au/news/more-than-40-per-cent-of-international-students-will-defer-until-they-can-return-on-campus-survey-finds",

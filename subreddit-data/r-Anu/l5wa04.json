            "comment": "You should try talking to someone in either PPE or the Computing School about your particular situation, however:\n\n* Most second-year courses, including most second-year computing courses, have a first-year course as a pre-requisite.  So you will not be allowed to enrol in second-year courses until you have completed the first-year courses.\n\n* Doing a double degree with PPE (which is already a kind-of-triple degree) will likely leave very very little room left to do any electives at all.  I would recommend checking through very carefully what your degree requirements are, and making sure you choose courses which allow you to complete your degree on time.\n\n* Following the 'First-Year Advice' on the degree page on Programs and Courses is an excellent place to start.",

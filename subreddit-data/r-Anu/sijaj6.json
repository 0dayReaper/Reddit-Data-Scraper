    "postText": "Sem 1 last year I had to take math1013 alongside phys1001, dropped math on the last day of the course, and still went on to successfully complete phys1001 with no apparent issues.\n\nThis sem I'm taking phys1101, and the same co-req applies. I can't find any information anywhere about how co-reqs work further than \"To enrol in this course you must have successfully completed or be currently studying MATH1013\". Last year I assumed that I wouldn't be able drop math without dropping physics, but that wasn't the case, which leads me to think that the co-req only applies literally when you enroll? \n\nIdeally I'll pass math1013, but itd be useful to know when the soonest I can dip before the census date is if history repeats itself.",

            "comment": "Hey! I am a current ANU biology student so I am not 100% sure how physics works, but if you are doing a major in physics you need to complete either MATH1013 or MATH1115 to enrol in PHYS1101 and progress through the major. PHYS1001 has no prerequisites so this would not have been a problem while you were taking that course. [https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2021/major/phys-maj](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2021/major/phys-maj) On the degree page it looks like you cannot complete a major in physics without essentially a minor in math. It sounds like it could be a good idea to go and have a chat with one of the deans to discuss your program [https://www.anu.edu.au/students/contacts/dean-of-students/anu-college-of-science-advisors](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/contacts/dean-of-students/anu-college-of-science-advisors). The 6th of May is the last day in semester 1 2022 to drop a course without failure [https://www.anu.edu.au/directories/university-calendar](https://www.anu.edu.au/directories/university-calendar). Hope this helps!",

    "postText": "I'm an Australian student currently finishing the IB. I'm currently debating between attending University of Sydney's double degree program in Math and Physics, or the PhB program in Physics at ANU. As far as I can tell, the entry rank is the same, but the PhB program is competitive, and I have to collate referral reports and a supplementary form with my application.   \n\n\nI just wanted to ask anyone who's actually doing the program (or someone with knowledge about it) as to whether its a good choice over a regular double degree program. To me, I'm apprehensive since ANU is in Canberra and I have to choose a single degree rather than having the option to take both math and physics at USYD.\n\nHowever, it seems like the perfect option for me, since I'm very interested in pursuing research.  \n\n\nCan anyone provide an opinion upon the program and whether it's worth taking it?",

            "comment": "I just started PhB this year so I'm not the most experienced but the freedom is great, and so is the mentoring and extra opportunities you get as a PhB student. There's a really nice community within the degree as well. There shouldn't be any compromise at all with you wanting to take Maths and Physics, you can do basically whatever courses you want, and  even more over the summer and winter breaks too. Plus, if your grades are good, I'd say you'd have a good chance of getting a decent scholarship.",

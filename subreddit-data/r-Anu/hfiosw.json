    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nDoes anyone happen to know when accommodation offers are likely to come out for Semester Two? I\u2019m a domestic student due to begin my degree next semester. I understand that it\u2019s especially tricky for everyone given the current circumstances/remote work but starting to feel the stress particularly as flights are already extremely limited at the moment. \n\nI have enquired about whether I should be studying remotely this semester but I\u2019ve received mixed responses, including that the ANU haven\u2019t yet decided. I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m going around in circles so would love to know if anyone has any guidance on this/is in a similar situation. Cheers!",

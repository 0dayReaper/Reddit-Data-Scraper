    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nJust a query regarding the second degree in a double law degree. I\u2019ve accepted an offer to study flexible double law at anu, and I initially listed PPE as my complementing degree. However, I\u2019m considering changing this to arts.\n\nHaving read my offer letter, it says the following: \u201caccept your offer now and confirm the degree combinations after you finish year 12\u2026 this combination may differ from those you selected at application.\u201d\n\nDoes this mean that I can simply chose arts instead of ppe later this year without having to change any preferences? Thanks in advance.",

They may not allow transfers to a degree with a higher entry requirement (eg Arts to Laws), but you can usually transfer after a semester or so (once you have demonstrated high enough grades).",

    "postText": "Hi, so I\u2019m looking to transfer internally between undergrad degrees. I\u2019m wanting to study communications and journalism but I can\u2019t see a degree that\u2019s specifically for that? There\u2019s no mention of it in Bachelor or Arts or anything (unless I\u2019ve missed it). So my question is, can Communications only been done as a major/minor or something or can it be done as a degree (in case I haven\u2019t looked carefully enough)?",

    "postText": "Howdy. Yesterday I received an accommodation offer for Wamburun Hall despite applying early and having my preference as Wright Hall. The non-catered option doesn't really work for my situation and I was quite looking forward to living in Wright since I have a couple of friends there. Is there any chance that I can get my offered changed or will I have to join some sort of wait list? Thanks in advance.",

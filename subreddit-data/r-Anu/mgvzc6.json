    "postText": "What planet is the administration flurrying around on. I'm sure they are busy with their hardcore business deals but it doesn't matter. Because the university bookstore doesn't sell rulers. The WOW store is closed. I couldn't be bothered going into Daily Mart to check, it's not their responsibility to supply anu students with rulers anyway. \n\nOn top of this mess, the university bookstore isn't even real. It's a chain! It's so ugly. Riddled with decor for money grabbing. I needed a dotted notebook and it was 12 dollars. \n\nKambri is pretty on the outside but truly ugly underneath all its glamour. The white pavement is so horrible, constantly reflecting harsh Australian sunlight into my eyeballs. Kambri won't supply students with rulers. Why do we have Ballistic Burrito and not a nice dusty university bookstore with a cute little old man who overstocks Michel Foucault, and stocks the perfect amount of rulers. Rulers of all sizes. \n\nI'm seriously done. This is Australia, it's supposed to be better.",

(Who the hell designed the seating in the new Manning Clark Hall?)\n\nThough in the current system of university management, the alternative to Harry Hartog isn't a nice dusty university bookstore with a cute little old man who overstocks Foucault, it was the Co-op Bookshop, a \"co-op\" that was so badly and unaccountably run that it went into administration and ended up having to sell to Booktopia. (It probably stocked a better selection of rulers, though.) Once upon a time, the Co-op was a genuinely student/faculty-focused organisation, but that's gone - not just at ANU, but nationally.\n\nThe loss of the Post Office/Union Shop, which stocked the things like generically-branded notebooks and all the other random crap you might urgently need, is pretty inexcusable IMHO.",

Or perhaps the thousands of kids murdered at Tiananmen Square were protesting about a lack of rulers in their education?\n\nActually, maybe you'll get sympathy from the famine-starved kids of Africa, who can only dream of surviving into their teenage years, let alone getting a privileged Western education at one of the most elite universities in the world.",

An Associate Dean can be in a position for more than 7 years without getting a promotion because they aren\u2019t \u201cpolitical\u201d enough.  \u201cpolitical\u201d should actually be replaced with \u201cscheming\u201d or \u201csneaky\u201d in this context. \n\nDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit odd that a major expense is going towards building an office for a Chancellor during a pandemic?? Professors made redundant for it?? The professors that can teach students about SyRiA? An office that is in Perth when it should be in Canberra? \n\nThe thing is, the Administrators in the top position are running a 2 billion dollar business - don\u2019t you think it could be managed better? I don\u2019t see the 2 billion dollars compounding anytime if the only changes made to this university are superficial. I see the validity of an ANU degree that could plummet if they are not careful. And the post I made about a ruler is a minor inconvenience that mirrors how this business is being managed solely for admin payoffs - not student payoffs. \n\nGet a grip and stop comparing everything to the terrors people are facing around the globe. Don\u2019t diminish them like that. \n\nInstead of the uni admin, I would prefer that you could come over and wipe my ass instead.",

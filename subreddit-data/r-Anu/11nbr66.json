    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI'm having trouble understanding the ANU calendar. Would it be right to say that the winter break will start around the 26th of May and end on the 24th of July. If anyone knows for certain - please let me know. I would like to book flights home in advance so I don't bankrupt myself. \n\nThanks.",

Be careful though as exams may be run up to 3 weeks after this (up until 17/6) depending on when they are scheduled so something to think about if you are booking flights.",

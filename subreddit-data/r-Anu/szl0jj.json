    "postText": "Hi everyone. I'm a prospective international student thinking of applying to ANU's MPhil program (2 years HDR). I've heard amazing things about the political research here, and life at Canberra seems to be a good match. But the college/school system is confusing me. Could you guys help a homie out?\n\nMy research interest lies in East Asia/ Australia.  So I would assume Coral Bell. However, CASS also covers political science/international relations. Would there be a difference in terms of research reputation, quality of professors and guidance, amount of publications etc?\n\nThe cost seems to be vastly different as well. \n\n* Coral Bell: 47k/year [https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2022/program/8510XMPHIL](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2022/program/8510XMPHIL)\n* CASS: 42k/year [https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2022/program/8520XMPHIL](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2022/program/8520XMPHIL)\n\nAs someone who isn't very well off, scholarships are quite important. Apparently it's super competitive. So provided I come up short, that 10k difference isn't insubstantial.\n\nLove to hear your insight, cheers!",

            "comment": "So ANU has 7 colleges:  \n\n\nCASS - College of Arts and Social Sciences  \nCAP - College of Asia and the Pacific  \nCBE - College of Business and Economics  \nCECS - College of Engineering and Computer Science  \nCOL - College of Law  \nCollege of Science   \nCollege of Health and Medicine.  \n\n\nThe Coral Bell School is a School (a smaller academic constituent unit) situated in the College of Asia and the Pacific (CAP).  \n\n\nI'm more familiar with the academics in CAP, and can strongly recommend the reputation and quality of professors in Coral Bell. If your interested in East Asia, I would probably recommend Coral Bell. CASS has a lot experts focusing on domestic Australian politics and IR but is primarily focused on Australia and Europe.  \nMy advice would be to reach out to directly to  CASS, or Coral Bell or their respective student centers to get a better sense.  \n\n\nFeel free to dm me (I did a Bachelors in CAP focusing on Asia Pacific Politics).",

You can stay on top of all lectures and readings (2 hours + another 2 hours for readings), or really only do the lectures needed to complete your assessments (bare minimum). Really up to you",

For science courses, more of those X/10 hours will be dedicated to in-class activities. If you are doing a standard full-time load of four courses per teaching block (a requirement for international students and those that want to finish their degree in the advertised time), you will be taking up a 40 hour per week commitment across 12 teaching weeks.",

            "comment": "I transferred from another Law school to usyd last year and also received an offer for ANU. They don\u2019t care what course/uni you\u2019re in, only the entrance score. If you\u2019ve done less than a full years worth of study (48cp), you\u2019ll be considered solely on your atar/OP and will therefore need a 99.5+ atar or OP 1. If you\u2019ve done more than a year, they\u2019ll take your WAM or atar/OP and assess you on whatever is most favourable. I recall the cutoff was a gpa of 6.5/7 for external transfers last year but this may have changed given it was 6.375 the year before. I\u2019d email or call their admissions team and ask if I were you - they can tell you on the spot whether your application is competitive or not ;). If you don\u2019t meet the required score and you really want to go to ANU, I\u2019d consider doing a year of your arts degree and then internally transferring (at usyd at least, the internal transfer requisite score is lower). If my memory is correct, NSW UAC offer rounds have come out since you\u2019ve made this post so I hope that you received an offer.",

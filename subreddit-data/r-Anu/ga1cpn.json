    "postText": "hi!! sorry for the addition of a new post along these lines, but i'm currently conflicted over accommodation at anu.\n\ni was looking into wamburun hall - but it appears to be a UniLodge and i've heard awful things about them (been told to avoid lena karmel). however, i keep receiving conflicting information and i'm unsure of whether or not it is one! can anyone clarify this for me? and if it is, what's it like to stay there?\n\nalso i'd love to hear about fenner hall and any other self-catered options :)\n\nthanks in advance!\n\nedit: really just tossing up between wamburun, fenner and b&amp;g, any opinions appreciated",

It's self catered so you can cook your own meals whenever you want instead of having to be in the dining hall at a certain time. The kitchens are very large and well equipped and cooking with other people is a good way to make friends. The common areas are definitely larger than other halls. It's also one of the oldest halls so it has a well developed sense of community.",

They are a seperate hall that have there own sports teams, culture, leadership etc. All the lodges are combined in sport for example and are generally seen as one entity with a lacking cultural and social scene. They are owned by lodge but don\u2019t think that they are part of lodge.",

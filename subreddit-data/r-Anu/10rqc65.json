    "postText": "I'm starting at ANU this semester and I'll be living in Burton and Garran hall. The dorm is self-catered and I personally enjoy cooking in batches and eating leftovers, so I'm wondering how much fridge space I can expect to have. Is this something I need to worry about? \n\nAlso, I saw listed somewhere that some but not all rooms have a mini fridge in them. How common is this, and is there any way to know if I'll have one? Is it a good idea to purchase one so that I can store food more easily?",

Massive market for them during these move-in periods.\n\nThe official fridge space at BnG only includes a basket sized space per person which meant meal prep was fairly difficult to balance out with other fresh food - especially someone like me who ate enormous amounts everyday.\n\nI highly recommend you get yourself a fridge. It means you can have milk in your room for breakfast, lunch ready to microwave in the common room and a beer to sip on after a long, hard days work.",

Even if it\u2019s small it just means you can have some milk and whatnot for the morning. I remember on orientation day almost all the rooms I went in had a minifridge in the corner so I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be an issue fitting one in.",

            "comment": "Hi :) I'm assuming you're talking about tutorials! Classes will only show up on your Wattle 14 days before classes start (so this sem 7th Feb). Different lecturers have different ways of opening up tutorial times, and it varies by department too. Some courses have tutorial sign-ups available from the moment classes get uploaded, some make you wait until Week 1, and others have them to open on a set date and time to ensure fairness. You'll have to look at each page and read the course guide to see what the rules are. Hope that helps !",

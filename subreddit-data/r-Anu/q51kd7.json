    "postText": "Hi guys! I have been accepted into Master of Statistics program at ANU (full fee). I have a major in Statistics and also have an offer from UNSW (with CSP). However, I am inclined towards doing the course in Canberra for a few reasons. I'll be moving from Perth and I have a family. My wife will be able to get a significantly better job in Canberra and commute seems like a big hassle in Sydney.\n\nNow, my understanding of the degree is that it can be as mathematically rigorous or applied as one wants it to be. As I have a major in statistics, I'll be substituting them for a few CS/ML courses as well.\n\nI just want to ask how the course is like and are there any red flags. How is the research project, is it easier to qualify for it and any other requirements other than GPA. Thanks",

I have to say ANU has been really good, I enjoy studying here (currently studying grad cert in stats)\n\nOn a side note, I\u2019m curious why UNSW is able to offer a CSP while ANU cant",

            "comment": "The most math heavy course is Statistical Inference STAT3013/STAT8027 which uses Casella and Berger and is a required course. If you haven\u2019t previously completed a similar course at the level of Casella and Berger then you definitely should brush up on your math stats and it wouldn\u2019t hurt to start reading Casella and Berger now.\n\nFor CS/ML courses I would recommend COMP6710 which is a foundational CS course and COMP8600 Statistical Machine Learning which uses the textbook Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. COMP8600 is a very math heavy machine learning course. MATH6110 which is real analysis seems like a good pick as well.\n\n In terms of textbooks STAT3013 (Statistical Inference) uses Casella and Berger, STAT2001 (Introductory Mathematical Statistics/Principles of Mathematical Statistics) uses Wackerly, STAT3040 (Statistical Learning) uses Introduction to Statistical Learning, STAT3050 (Advanced Statistical Learning) uses Elements of Statistical Learning, STAT2008 (Regression Modelling) uses Applied Linear Regression Models/Applied Linear Statistical Models but Kutner. To find which textbooks a class uses you can go on Programs and Courses and select a previous year then select the \u2018Class\u2019 tab and select \u2018View Class\u2019 under \u2018Class Summary\u2019 and it should give you info like what textbooks the class uses etc.",

It's not that hard but you probably want to do at least say a couple hundred exercises from Wackerly Ch 2-10. That's what I've done anyway. So far everything has been pretty easy, although I haven't done the final exam yet. Once you've done like 300 Wackerly exercises the questions become pretty routine just recognising the same patterns. It's an open book exam this year as well so no real need to memorise lots of formulas which is nice. It is a less advanced course compared to the one which uses Casella and Berger and both are required courses.",

I, however, studied relevant sections and worked out few of the exercises from C&amp;B.\n\nI am thinking of doing COMP6630, 6670 and 8600. Are you currently enrolled in Master of Statistics? Any idea about the thesis?",

I see so many comments on many uni formums now about how do I make the most money, or I only got a Distinction, in ten years no one cares, how you did in your last job / project is so much more relevant than what score you got in some subject 10+ years ago.   \n\n\nIts been 31 years since I graduated my first degree - and no one has ever asked to see my transcripts other then new universities that I wanted to study at.   \n\n\nI would also keep the address and contact details of people I met stored in a better manner, there is so many people that I have lost contact with.",

    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm planning on applying to ANU to begin 2021, and I have been looking at the B Adv. Comp. (R&amp;D) which I want to combine in a flexible double with B Arts (possibly with Year in Asia program). Does anyone know if this is even possible? \n\nI've tried to contact ANU admissions support but the first time I did so, I got an error, and the second time (a few days later) it seemed successful but I haven't heard back and it has been almost a month now. \n\nMy confusion comes from the fact that the degree combination (on the ANU website) seems to only take 5 years. This seems almost impossible given that regular double degrees remove electives in order to shorten the degree by 2 years, and that both the degrees I am combining take 4 years, meaning the total degree should be a minimum of 6 years right? (8 usually, but 1 year of electives removed from both). So I'm just a little confused as to where units would come from. If it truly is a 5-year degree program, wouldnt this imply the 144 units (3 years) from compulsory work in the R&amp;D degree, the Year in Asia and then only 48 units from Arts to comprise the total 192 units? Does the Year in Asia also not count towards the unit total?\n\nAlso, in terms of pricing, if the double degree costs the same as the total of both degrees, would I pay the cost of an arts degree for only 48units of Arts?\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading!",

            "comment": "You will probably be able to combine those two degrees for a flexible degree. I\u2019m doing a BSc and BDesign which is a 4 year flexible double degree with 192 units. \nSome Flexible degrees tend to be longer, check with the specific college. \nAbout the costs, you are essentially paying per course. So if you do a single degree of 3 years you\u2019re gonna pay for the courses in that time period. When you have a double degree, in my case I have another year which would cost me 8 more courses. \nHope this helped :) , dm me if you wanna talk",

I think you're right about the Year in Asia just being excluded from the total length, but I'm not sure when you are supposed to apply for it, as one of the requirements is having completed 48 units of study. They also recommend having at least 6 units of study left once you complete the Year in Asia. So, I'm just going to assume I'll be able to apply at some point during my degree, so I can sort that out once I get there!\n\nAgain, thank you!",

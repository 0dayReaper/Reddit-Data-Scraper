    "postText": "I was curious as to whether anyone here knew the difference, or could explain it clearly. From what I've seen they have a lot of crossover. Would a bachelor of commerce majoring in finance be a better all-rounder? Or does it not matter?\n\nAlso does anyone have any advice about finance classes in general, and/or majors to pick?  \n\n\nJust curious about peoples opinions on the usefulness of these degress, especially in Canberra. Thanks for any help!",

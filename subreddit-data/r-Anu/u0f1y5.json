And even now, I'm not sure whether I'm eligible to apply / not since I use national curriculum, but one of my friends told me that they accept indonesian curriculum for the bachelor of arts programs. I could also apply to Melbourne but I think I need 1 year of foundation in order to be able to get in and I don't think I want to do that. Are you indonesian by any chance tho?",

It was 4 years ago tho, Australia needs international students to come badly now, so they may ease the application process. There are many documents you need to prepare aside from the uni application, like the visa, passport, proof of finances, etc. So highly recommend asking an agent, and I believe they don't cost any money, so its good. \n\nand the curriculum wise, I was gonna say, ANU is the highest rank uni in Australia, so I am not sure how easy to get into the uni actually (I am on this Reddit cause I intend to apply sometime next year). I live in Melbourne and I know that Melbourne Uni, Monash, RMIT, Deakin and Swinburne are fairly easy to get into as an international student.\n\nYou mentioned you need to receive the offer by June at the latest. That timing is very tight, but it's doable. I suggest you start getting things done! Definitely go to an agent ASAP, and if you can don't just go visit IDP, visit the other agency as well, because they have different requirements and see which one matches your situation. For example, I went to IDP, Superstar and SUN agencies. One of the requirements to apply for the student visa was proof of bank statement that my sponsor (my parents) have enough money to support my living while I am in Aussie. IDP requirement is to have Rp. 500,000,000 in the bank and Superstar is only required to have Rp 300,000,000. I am not sure if you still need this requirement as you are getting a scholarship, just an example! This must be exciting for you! Studying in Australia is great, I tell you that!\n\nCan I ask what kinda scholarship you get? And will you be graduating from high school soon?",

I have contacted the IDP and definitely will use their help. \n\nYes, I'll be graduating from high school soon, probably this May. I'm planning to use the BPI (Beasiswa Pendidikan Indonesia) scholarship. They have a new program so high schoolers that are planning to take bachelor degree in top university abroad could apply. They also have a program for Masters (S2) so I highly recommend you to check that out. They're going to open the scholarship today at 8:00 west Indonesian time.\n\nThe scholarship website : https://beasiswa.kemdikbud.go.id/\n\nAnyway, do you know any undergraduate students that study in Australian top uni like University of Melbourne or ANU that used indonesian national in their high school? is it necessary for indonesian that uses national curriculum to do a foundation year? Because I'm not sure if I could get in without a foundation year as I don't see national indonesian curriculum in their program requirements, but one of my friends got into their bachelor of arts program with a national curriculum. Still, I'm not really convinced. Could you verify this?",

And there are lots of indonesian studying in Melbourne, but I don't know anything about ANU as I don't live in Canberra. \n\nah I am not interested in the scholarship, I am just curious. Cause Kemdikbud wants you to go back after studying and dedicate yourself to Indonesia, and I want to live permanently in Aussie. thanks tho, I'll let my friends know about this! I hope you are getting the scholarship! you can always DM me on Reddit, if you ever have any questions and best of luck!",

I\u2019m more on the introverted side so not being forced out of my room to socially interact is a plus to me. \n\nI\u2019d also say that the living conditions and cost effectiveness of Lena is above most of the colleges, if not all. Some of the colleges don\u2019t have air conditioning, making them insufferable during summer times.",

            "comment": "Hey there, I did 9 ECON coded courses as part of my degrees, and I started with little to no maths skills (I didn't finish year 10 maths). Economics at ANU is rigorous and does require maths, but you will be taught the required skills as you progress through your courses - i.e. foundational skills in micro 1, then intermediate in micro 2 etc. But if you're not very comfortable with mathematics domains like algebra or calculus, be prepared to do study in your outside hours to help yourself prepare. I think a lot of people start economics expecting to give political opinions or political analysis on how money should be spent (which is the focus of a small number of classes) when in reality economics is a mathematical area of study.",

EMET1101 is a course you should try to avoid it your math skills aren\u2019t great. The entire course is advanced math problems. Macro and micro2 you will need to be familiar with algebra, and knowing calculus will help\u2026 although is it not necessary and you will get by without it. Hope this helps.",

Firstly, the workload is definitely manageable so don\u2019t be too deterred by that.\n\nSecondly, there definitely are courses, such as EMET1001, that are entirely maths based. I still don\u2019t understand how some of the maths we learnt even vaguely applies to economics. But the majority of the courses don\u2019t require that advanced understanding, at least so far",

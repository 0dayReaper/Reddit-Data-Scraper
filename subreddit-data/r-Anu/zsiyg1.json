I am grateful for any suggestions as I don't want to arrive and realise I have missed something crucial.\n\nThankyou",

            "comment": "hey, so all residents are allocated their own fridge space in the communal kitchens, but a mini fridge is definitely handy for small things. I used mine to store milk, fruit and drinks. I definitely would recommend getting one, but I'd wait until you get to Canberra after getting a real sense of what you need. There's nothing worse than arriving with a fridge and realising you can't fit it anywhere!",

Got my stuff nicked many times by drunks.\n\nwhen you get there, consider going to civic to get a nice big laundry basket and write your name on it. Will be helpful when you're doing washing and prevent losing items.\n\nenjoy b&amp;g :)",

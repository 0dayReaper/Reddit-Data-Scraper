    "postText": "ANU's IT services arnt student friendly at all. \n\nI started studying at ANU this year after transferring from another university and I was just wondering why the IT services for students are so abysmal, and if there are any particular reasons, e.g. economical, political, legal, etc.\n\nThe Uni I came from got a bunch of shit for its it system, but now it appears leaps and bounds ahead of ANU, which is disgraceful for what claims to be a world class university.\n\nIk that ranking are typically based on research and what not, but how can they just let it be this bad and confusing.\n\nThe official timetabling system is just dogshit and IK undergraduates that could design it better.\u00a0 The unofficial ones a little better, let's you kinda attempt to organise your classes but the UI is not friendly for swapping things around and seeing what fits best where like a timetable planner should be. \n\nBut none of that really matters cause the enrolments just open whenever the lecturer opens them so there's no uniformity between classes, I guess this pays off for the super prepared individual as they will know what's happening when but for most people I don't think it helps at all and I personally ended up having to just timetable over most of the lectures cause I missed the open date. \n\nThere are other things like having no good nagivation app for finding your way around campus. The UIs feel dated most of the time and often there's just a different website for every little service even different classes using different enrolment methods. \n\nOverall does anyone know why it's structured and built the way it is, and is there anyone talking about this at the uni? Also does anyone have any other examples/thoughts on the topic?",

Before covid we were running skeleton staffing. And covid has caused loss of another 300 staff.\n\nSo it's not going to improve anytime soon.",

Also I'm not sure how the financials work but wouldn't unis make most of their money from graduates paying back their tuition? \n\nWhat kind of jobs did they cut? Cause I've heard a lot about bloating of management positions in unis and was wondering if this is a thing?\n\nEdit:\nI just googled the unis financials:\n\nanu.edu.au/files/review/ANU_Annual_Report_2019.pdf\n\nAnd in 2019 they had a 303 million dollar surplus?? Not exactly strapped for cash",

The same system regional universities like Newcastle uni were using 15 years ago. And so many things that are still done by hard copy paperwork. I was honestly shocked that Australia's national university and supposedly #1 university is so far behind the times.",

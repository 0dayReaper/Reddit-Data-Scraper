    "postText": "Hey just a question I\u2019m currently a Bachelor of arts student at ANU and I\u2019m a first year. I know to transfer to law you need have done at least 48 units and received an overall GPA of 5.6. But is it still possible to be rejected for a transfer into law if you have gotten a 5.6 GPA? \n\nThank uuu",

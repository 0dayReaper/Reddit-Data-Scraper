    "postText": "Hi seniors! I just received my accommodation offer for a 3 bedroom apt at Davey lodge. However, due to mental health reasons I much prefer staying in a studio, and hence me checking out other options. I found All Saints College at All Saints Anglican Church is open for applications. Does anyone have any experiences staying there? Thank you for sharing!!",

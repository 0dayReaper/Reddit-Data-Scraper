(I\u2019m planning on majoring in marketing under commerce)\n- is this degree combination popular?\n- is ANU well known for commerce, or am I better off going to Sydney to study commerce and arts?",

            "comment": "I've definitely seen people with an art/commerce double, and think it's quite a good combo. I'd agree with what arderna says, it might depend on what your major is in Arts.\n\nI'm studying commerce (not marketing in particular), but the workload is pretty easily manageable for management-related subjects.\n\nIn terms of University, ANU is really good for Arts, languages, cultural and political studies but might slightly favour government/politics/public service-related jobs as potential career options since they are so close - esp. if you also do commerce. Sydney, I'd say might potentially be a tiny bit better for marketing, communication, and journalism (I noticed you were thinking of doing this). I've heard a lot of good things about journalism degrees in Sydney + ANU doesn't really have any journalism courses - but does have a good amount of co-curricular activities related to it that you can engage with.\n\nI'd say have a look through some graduates of both ANU (e.g. through LinkedIn), and any other Universities you were thinking of. But also have a think about what type of work you would like to get into - I think this could help a lot.\n\nIf you can't decide, think about some of the other factors: Housing, culture, and whether or not you want to stay in that city or move around. There is of course always the option of doing a degree in one city, then getting a job in another. You can always transfer Universities as well, if you didn't like the vibe.\n\nHope this helps :)",

Seeing that you\u2019re someone who studies commerce, it might be suitable for you to answer this; is the maths required for the compulsory units difficult, or is it manageable enough for someone who isn\u2019t a genius in maths? Also, as for the arts major, I was thinking of pursuing literature or sociology? \nAhaha it\u2019s a bit of a tossup between arts/commerce and arts/law currently\u2026 not sure which I should pursue as I\u2019m pretty open minded at this point",

To be honest, I'm not the greatest at maths either and did find it harder at times, but with a little hard work, it should all be ok. \n\nBUSN1001 is basically just simple accounting stuff, mostly focusing on financial statements, and a bit of calculation - just requires a bit of practice for exams which tend to be a bit harder - the assignment is quite easy to get done. Both economics courses are ok, and not too heavily dependant on calculations (rather using numbers to support analysis and explanation of concepts) - if you've ever done economics in high school, it's basically the same, just a little more detailed. Macro is a bit harder, with some new topics introduced. STAT1008 is essentially just probability, and statistics. The assignments are quite good, and ok to get through if you give them some time (the marks from them saved my grade in the end), the only challenge I found was probability in the exams which is basically the same as later high-school probability, just a little more detailed, and difficult.\n\nI'm actually not too sure about literature, just haven't really heard much about it. Sociology could be good, I'd say there would be some good research pathways if that was your thing. If you pair arts with law and do well, you'd have a lot of opportunities in the city and beyond - whether it be law firms, government-related or even consulting jobs. Sociology paired with commerce could also be interesting. I've seen people pair psychology with marketing/other commerce majors which has given them more insight, and potentially an edge over others. \n\nLaw is pretty much always good to pair with most things. It's just a bit hard to get into, and does require that you do well once you're in it - but if you do well, definitely consider it!",

Excel was pretty much taught at the start (only really weeks 1-3) of the semester in tutorials - and was really just shortcuts and stuff for data sets. The vast majority of tutorials are question sets which require lines of working (which the tutor goes through).\n\nBut yes, expect to be writing, and using a calculator. Exams largely consisted of theory-based questions (multiple choice, and short response answers), followed by traditional formula/working out questions (which are the bulk of marks).\n\nAssignments were mainly analysing data sets, so: theory with some traditional calculations. You'll definitely use excel though, since the data sets you choose require graphs and stuff to be made.\n\nHope this helps :)",

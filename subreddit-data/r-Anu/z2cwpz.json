    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nWould like to work for the DOD one day in policy. Trying to get some recommendations for some degrees that would be particularly relevant in that field to pair with a BA, or at least more relevant than others. Has to be a degree with an entry requirement of 80.\n\nMy options are as followed:\n\nBachelor of Commerce\n\nBachelor of Pacific Studies\n\nBachelor of Economics\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",

            "comment": "The public service allows entry from any degree type, so don\u2019t get too caught up on the specific area and go for more of what you enjoy. None of those particularly relate to Defence (except Pacific Studies maybe, if that\u2019s an area you want to go for, but probably more relevant to DFAT). Commerce and Economics are both good general knowledge areas to have for the public service. With a combined arts degree (presumably you\u2019ll major in something more relevant, like IR or Security), you can\u2019t really go wrong. Just keep a GPA above a 5 (the public service minimum from what I\u2019ve seen, basically a credit average), and you\u2019ll be fine.",

But commerce could give you the skills to go through that pathway anyway. Commerce and economics fall under the same department at the ANU (Commerce, Business, Economics), so you\u2019ll probably be able to borrow electives/courses etc.",

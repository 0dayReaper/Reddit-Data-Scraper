            "comment": "Hi OP,\n\nWelcome to ANU!\n\nAssuming you're studying a Bachelor of Political Science beginning S1 2023, you can find a rough recommended course structure plan from ANU at the bottom of the 'study' tab on [your degree page](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2023/program/bplsc). Here is a screen grab of it [here.](https://imgur.com/StBE80r)\n\nTo be clear, you do not have to follow this format, but you do need to complete all of the requirements listed in the study section of your degree page.\n\nAs a Political Science student, I did follow the recommended course structure for my first year.  I would personally recommend sticking to it for your mandatory courses as it often aligns with when they are being offered.\n\nThis would mean that for your first semester, you would be completing [POLS1002](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2023/course/POLS1002), a political philosophy course from the list on the same page I've linked, and two electives. Re the philosophy course: your options are limited because the most courses on offer require you to have done a certain amount of other courses for entry. Because of this, I would assume you're probably going to be doing [PHIL1004](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2023/course/PHIL1004).\n\nRe electives: you have 8  to complete by the end of your degree. These electives can be made up of any group of courses you'd like (assuming you meet their course requirements). That being said, many people take these 8 courses as an opportunity to complete a major within their Political Science degree. I personally am studying a major in Sociology.\n\nIf you wish to do a major, you need to log this through ISIS to ensure it shows that way when you graduate.\n\nI hope this was somewhat coherent\u2026 Feel free to message if you have any other questions :)",

This is very true for the methods list &amp; Australian political history list (I had to take a winter course because they\u2019re weren\u2019t enough offerings by the time I got around to taking the second course). Generally, it\u2019s easy to do the first course in a list if you need to do, say, 12-18 units on a certain list (2-3 courses, 1 course = 6 units), but make sure you do the first one early enough so you can fit in the later ones as well. That said, this is definitely still a completeable degree.",

Will I miss out on courses if I enroll later?\n\nCan't call them and the email replies are slow",

Also for the usi you may want to contact student central to try and get it sorted.\nhttps://www.anu.edu.au/students/contacts/student-central\n\nEdit: sorry just checking, but why do you need a temporary usi?, I thought both domestic and international students were able to apply for a permanent usi, or are you not able to apply while overseas?",

I feel less concerned now as there\u2019s still a bit of time\n\nI have contacted them it\u2019s just been over a week now since they replied, I guess they\u2019re busy atm. \n\nYou need to be in Australia to apply for a USI with non-Australian ID, so I think they\u2019ll have to apply on my behalf",

Because they still hadn't released 3 weeks later I sent them an email a couple days ago (because they had a phone outage) and they said it would be 1 week max. I would take their word with a grain of salt. Tons of others seem to be in the same situation.",

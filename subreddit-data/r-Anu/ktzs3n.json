    "postText": "I'm thinking about choosing on campus accomodation at ANU this year, but I don't know if I want to stay on campus for the full year, mainly for financial concerns. However a PDF on [this site](https://www.anu.edu.au/study/accommodation/advice-procedures/accommodation-2021-what-you-need-to-know) says \n\n&gt;If you cancel your agreement after accepting this offer, clause 12 of your [occupancy agreement](https://www.anu.edu.au/files/document-collection/2021%2520Occupancy%2520agreement%2520FINAL.pdf) will apply and you will be liable for your rent until a replacement is found.  \n\nHow likely is it that a replacement will be found? Is there a lot of demand for accomodation?\n\nAny help is appreciated.",

    "postText": "I grew up in Canberra, studied at ANU (not Engineering), had some problems, did other things after graduating, stint in APS etc. I studied Civil Engineering at another Go8 University almost a decade after leaving school.\n\nWhile in high school I was in a group of friends who were all very bright, and several went to ANU and studied Engineering straight out of school because Engineering suited them and since they lived in Canberra with their parents ANU was their only real choice.\n\nAll their career outcomes are awful, some ended up in jobs that were effectively Electronics Engineering (mediocre industry in Australia), others were duped into doing PhD's and are stuck in academia, some spiralled off into barely related fields, and a few other 'Engineers' I met while at ANU ended up in the APS. All still in Canberra.\n\nA few years since I finished my own degree and I've pretty much caught up in terms of pay, I'm in a highish paying role for where I'm at in my career but most of my mates were as bright and hard working as I was and you'd expect similar outcomes, you'd expect a near decade head start would just be insurmountable.\n\nANU's Engineering school is simply that much of a joke and I don't know of anyone who's studied Engineering there and done well whereas pretty much my entire cohort from my 2nd degree works in the field they studied.\n\nANU recently revised their majors and got rid of the weird mechanical/materials major which wasn't a real mechanical degree or anything of any use in industry and they've aligned their other majors a little more with what employers actually understand a degree covers but it's still fundamentally electronic/mechatronic engineering under the guise of systems engineering.\n\nIf you are really driven and passionate about working for a startup where you'll be building/designing drones or you really truly want to do mechatronics go for your life but without the normal employable majors like like Civil, Mechanical, Mining and Electrical most people graduating will struggle to find a job that really utilises their weird niche degree, and it's doubly bad if you stay in Canberra and you have hundreds of other people with the same weird niche degrees trying to get the same niche jobs.\n\nIt does look like they've moved toward offering something closer to normal Electrical Engineering as a masters but you can do it in a 4 year undergrad anywhere else.\n\nWhile I didn't study there myself the effect studying at this joke engineering school has had on the lives of my old high school mates is shocking, people who in any other city would be making bank as senior engineers or potentially climbing toward management on the contractor side instead just languishing in mediocrity is sad.\n\nYear 12 students (in Canberra of all places) don't understand the industry and don't understand that they're being railroaded in a really stupid direction if they study \"Engineering\" at the main local university, it's incredibly unfair and it's incredibly difficult and costly to study again after your mid 20s once you realise you studied bullshit, if you have a family to support it's basically game over.\n\nIf you're a bright, hard working, technically minded year 12 student who wants to become an Engineer, **get out of Canberra**. Don't fall into the trap of studying Engineering at this place just because it's there and you won't have to leave home.",

                    "comment": "&gt;I do also observe many a mechanical engineering grad ending up at Accenture doing boring IT contractor work, which makes me sad.\n\nYeah I totally concede mechanical has plenty of real jobs but WAY too many people studying it, and the Engineering -&gt; IT jump is common, especially for Mechanical, Aerospace, Mechatronics, ect.\n\nBut there are good mechanical jobs in the M&amp;E side of infrastructure, there are good mechanical jobs in mining, in oil and gas. There's a broad supply/demand issue and subdisciplines like aerospace are basically non-existent in Australia, but broadly if you're good you can get something good in any major city in Australia.\n\nI don't mean to shit on mechatronics but it's just bizarre to have an engineering school in a city of 400,000 people without much actual industry pumping out exclusively electronics/mechatronics/sustainable-whatever graduates completely out of line with what industry will take and it's not like there's a shortage once you leave Canberra. Mechatronics is offered almost everywhere and you can do a normal electrical engineering degree slanted toward electronics too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;but I would strongly suggest that prospective electronics engineers get themselves a decent grounding in the software and CS side of the fence as well\n\ngood advice, but doing a switcheroo to a related field with better prospects where your previous study helps is a good move to make at the time you make it, but not exactly what most people would want to plan for from the outset.",

While the employment of other universities in this field is definitely a lot higher than ANU, that should be assumed knowledge at this point. \n\nI think the actual main point is that you should know what you are going in for. It should not be a priority to get out of canberra just because the employment rate is lower than other universities, but you do give good points on ANU\u2019s specialisations. \n\nThere are many reasons for getting an engineering degree, but if you go in expecting to go straight into the field you studied with little issues, then you haven\u2019t done your research, and you have made a bad decision.",

That's not really a bad outcome, getting that sort of outcome or worse after slogging through 4+ years of labs and exams and overnighters on the other hand is pretty crap.",

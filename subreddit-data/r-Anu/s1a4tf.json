    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019ve been considering studying at ANU for cyber security but don\u2019t know how good the university is in this field. For people who\u2019ve studied computing there, are the facilities/teaching good? Are you overall happy with choosing ANU or is it overrated? Does it help with employability? Is it a good uni for someone who would like to pursue it academically/research it in the future? From what I\u2019ve read, Deakin and Edith Cowan Uni are apparently providing better (and shorter) courses, despite them being \u201c3rd rate universities\u201d. In your opinion, which (Deakin/ECU or ANU) would be the better choice?\n\nI\u2019m quite clueless and would love any advice. (Also the location/accommodation isn\u2019t an issue for me).\nThank you!",

I would recommend joining the ANU CompSci Student Association Discord server ([http://cssa.club/discord](http://cssa.club/discord)) and having a read through the chat history. These questions get asked pretty often, and there is a good variety of students there.\n\nMight be worth providing some more detail about your background and interests too - uni goals, CS experience, career aspirations, social needs etc. Work in Canberra is very different to other cities. Mostly government, which isn't everyone's cup of tea, but there are very interesting technical challenges and impacts here that aren't available elsewhere.\n\nFeel free to DM me (@pl4nty on Discord) if you have further questions. I'm pretty biased though, since I left the BAC R&amp;D for a cyber job midway through last year.",

I am currently finish my undergraduate at the University of Melbourne, and I was wondering if there was any news of a 2023-intake Honours Information session happening anytime soon? I can't find any information about this online (I have watched the 2021 recording, but of course would be handy to gain current insight).\n\nThanks!",

    "postText": "Hello guys, I recently got offered a position for Engineering r&amp;d from ANU and was looking into the course. From the ANU website, the course looks promising, yet the qs ranking seems to place it lower. I know rankings may not be accurate, so I was looking for student experience in this subject/faculty to help decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpecifically, I wish to pursue an aerospace major, so if anyone is also doing the same course/pathways, can you share your experience at the uni, and whether it is very prestigious or worse than expectations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks so much in advance",

            "comment": "Basically, aerospace is a brand new focus for ANU. THE QS isn't there because there's no history. A lot of the aerospace faculty have been recently brought in as high-flying international hires.  ANU reputation traditionally is to focus on a broad, systems engineering approach.\nWhatever they do it will connect into work on InSpace, so really focusing on the industry holistically. I'd encourage you to look that up.",

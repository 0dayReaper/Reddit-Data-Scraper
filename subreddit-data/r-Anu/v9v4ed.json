    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm a high school student who wants to get into the ANU R and D program, however, I don't have any CS experience and don't take it as a subject. I no effectively nothing about coding.\n\nAlthough the website does not list CS as a prerequisite, I am concerned that having no CS experience immediately makes me uncompetitive compared to other students. Does ANU care about this stuff? I also do ANU Extension if that matters.\n\nMy subjects are:\n\n* English\n* Maths\n* Biology\n* Economics\n* Geography\n\nAny help on this would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "The [ACR&amp;D Programs and Courses Page](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2022/program/aacrd) lists Specialist Maths (double math) as the only prerequisite. The first year computer science courses assume that you know nothing about computer science and that you have never programmed before. With that being said, I would recommend doing some programming before starting your first semester since it will make COMP1100 (or COMP1130) more manageable.\n\nIf you are not accepted in ACR&amp;D you could always apply for the regular Advanced Computing degree and then transfer after your first year. To do this you would need to maintain an average of 80% during your first year. This is actually what I did, so if you have any questions regarding this process feel free to DM me.",

I used to tutor COMP1100, and the number of students who joined because they wanted to learn to make games, but had no actual experience with computers other than playing them was depressing.",

I can\u2019t really comment on what the undergrad course there is like but I\u2019m currently doing the cyber security masters and having a lot of fun. \n\nWith that said, I definitely learnt a hell of a lot more from my ANU undergraduate degree than I have so far in this masters. \n\nIf you do go with ANU, you can get a head start now by starting to learn Haskell - if you already know how to code, you have a lot to unlearn because functional programming is very different. You can get help via IRC - https://www.haskell.org/irc/ (and come say hi).",

My first program I wrote was in COMP1130 (the introductory course some others have mentioned).\n\nYou definitely do not need programming experience to do well in the degree/get the most out of it. If you are capable of meeting the entry requirement (ATAR) for R&amp;D then you will be able to pick up the programming.",

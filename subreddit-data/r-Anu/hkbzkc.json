    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm planning to live on campus at ANU start of next year and I have a few questions.\n\n1. When would I have to submit an application for accommodation beginning 2021?\n\n2. Does accommodation roll over to the following year?\n\n3. Which student residency has the value for money?\n\nThanks! :)",

Or are you already studying and wanting to switch to living on campus?\n2. ???\n3. Your call mate. Pretty much the two 'levels' of accommodation are catered and non-catered, and there is obviously a significant price differential between the two. If money is a big focus, there are far cheaper accomodation alternatives than living on campus...",

Some halls have different applications (returners apps) for people who have already lived in a residence hall and want to stay there, which is taken directly through the res hall and not through the housing portal. This is how people stay in the same hall year to year. You can also apply to transfer to different halls during/after your contract, subject to capacity.\n\nIf you\u2019re a first year, you\u2019ll probably get placed in a hall. It might not be the one you applied for, but you probably won\u2019t have to look off campus.",

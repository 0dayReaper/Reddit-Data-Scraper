Assume you\u2019re not guaranteed to be able to be at Bruce during the summer break, though you might be able to if its one of the halls that are open. It\u2019s a seperate system to normal accomodation.",

            "comment": "This is 'general' advice re college, I have stayed at several (Burgmann - ANU, Johns - JCU, Emmanual - UQ)  of them, the last being over 20 years ago, so things may have changed since then - but I doubt it.   \n\n\nIn first year - I stayed in college for one of the two week breaks, there was no problems from college and about 40 of us where still 'in house' over the holiday.   \n\n\nNote: Colleges often fill up with conferences over the holidays, so college won't necessarily be empty in the 'holiday' periods.   \n\n\nIn later years (postgrad) I stayed the entire summer semester in college, there was about 10 of us who where there for the entire summer semester.   \n\n\nThat summer that I spent in the usually empty emmanuel college, was fantastic, we would walk into the dining hall and basically we had personal chefs, since there was about 10 of us - they would cook up indiviudal meals and the kitchen would talk to us about what we waited for meals later in the week etc.,   \n\n\nWhen there was a conference in house - we just had to eat the same meal as them, I am a pretty social person, so I really enjoyed talkign to the people that were in house for the conference and see what the conference was about. It was interesting for a short time (dinner time) - any topic at a high enough level is pretty well interesting.   \n\n\nI remember many long conversations that summer about how paint drys (as that was one of the PHD students topic who was also staying over).   \n\n\nIn Summary Colleges work with you to make sure you are looked after, if your college is not open when you need it another one will be. I never had a problem with college with when to move in / out / stay late / leave early. They are used to dealing with a lot of students on different timetables and have this all sorted out.",

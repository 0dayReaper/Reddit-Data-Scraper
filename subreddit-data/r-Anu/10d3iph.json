It\u2019s part of the CBD, so they *should* do? Even if you get them to deliver it to Barry Drive and carry it back to campus yourself. \n\nI lived at Wamburun for a semester and totally feel your pain. The closest proper-ish supermarket is the Daily Mart on Campus (underneath Badger, in Kambri).\n\n\nYou could try the new hall for a semester and do an internal hall transfer in the middle of the year (applications open early winter break, I think. Google internal hall transfers ANU and it should tell you). This is probably the easiest way. It\u2019s a lot easier to apply from one lodge/hall to another once you\u2019re already there, then trying to change it now. The 4 Lodges are probably up to close to full enrolment now, so your best bet is to hope people move off mid year (which does happen). FYI all the lodge buildings are self-catered. Seems to be a speciality.",

Usually the it's just put it in a tray in the oven for a few minutes and it's ready. Combine it with boiled pasta and you'd have a decent meal. This might be a good option for you.\n\nEdit: I've been at Wamburun for the last 3 years and can confirm that deliveries from Coles are available for a minimum of $4 delivery fee. Yukeembruk is right next to Wamburun so I'd assume delivery should be available at a similar price",

            "comment": "Given how much they vary in price, it\u2019s hard to give a recommendation to you without a budget. Another important factor is whether you want a catered accomodation, or one where you cook for yourself.\n\nI live in Kinloch Lodge and love it. It\u2019s among the cheapest residences, the location is right between campus and the city, and you get your own kitchen/bathroom. The only downside is that it lacks the culture and social scene of the ANU halls, but as someone who doesn\u2019t mind his own company, it\u2019s perfect for me",

It\u2019s perfect for its social scene.\n\nHelps that catering is provided for, saving you time spent shopping and cooking. But it does mean that you\u2019re at the mercy of someone else\u2019s cooking. I\u2019ve heard the Bruce good is not bad, but not great",

Small convenience store, bottle shop, couple cafes in the immediate area. \n\nBushwalking, mountain biking at Bruce ridge, 50 metre swimming pool at AIS/Cisac. You are within the catchment of uber food/grocery delivery networks\n\nLots of live sport to watch, Rugby league, Rugby union and now the A league soccer. \n\nSuggest looking around Thynne street for a place. \n\nMore importantly you will have independence and can participate in society like a real grown up instead of being in the confines of campus life and bubble tea.",

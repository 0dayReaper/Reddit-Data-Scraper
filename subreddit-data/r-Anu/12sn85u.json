    "postText": "I\u2019m an international student coming next semester from Ireland. What accommodation would be best for international students as I\u2019m 21 and don\u2019t want to be with only first years. Im thinking catering would be a good idea. Looking for people who are sociable and want to party. Having other international students that want to travel would be nice too!",

            "comment": "If you're looking for sociable, avoid unilodge; I learnt the hard way. Also since you like catered Unilodge is already ruled out. Glad you're being proactive and asking out here. Anyway, unilodge very socially lacking. For catering I'd recommend the colleges, such as Bruce, Wright, John's, and Burgmann. John's and Burgmann are expensive and mostly have domestic students. As a result, they tend to be where richer students go. Bruce and Wright are good choices for catered accommodation. One of my friends lives at Bruce and he really likes it.",

We recently had an international students Q&amp;A panel too and the rescom frequently organises events so the social scene is very good. Also the cafe at yukeembruk serves alcohol on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.",

Chinese students tend to stick with Chinese students, Indians with Indians, etc. \n\nIt's really more about language in my opinion. If you speak English and the rest of the 450 international students mainly speak Mandarin, you're gonna have a tough time. \n\nI really think especially because OP is Irish it would be better for him socially to be in a hall with people who speak his language.",

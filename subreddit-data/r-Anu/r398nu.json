    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI have been looking through the ANU website finding out about potential majors for an engineering degree, and it\u2019s a little unclear to me whether Aerospace Engineering is a major you can complete.\n\nThe [CECS page](cecs.anu.edu.au/study/undergraduate/bachelor-engineering-honours) lists 4 majors, where the \n\n[Programs and courses](programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/major/ASSY-MAJ) page shows an Aero major, although notably only offered for the year 2022 (is it new?).\n\nAny help would be awesome!",

    "postText": "Hi guys, \n\nIs anyone here an International Relations or middle eastern studies student?\n\nCurrently I'm tossing up between doing law/IR or law/middle eastern studies. I'm obviously interested in the Middle East and would ideally like to work there someday, but this is more out of prior knowledge of the region rather than personal connection. Don't know if I'd be better off doing a more general IR degree or sticking to ME studies, either way, I'm gonna try to learn Arabic.\n\nIf you are doing either of these degrees, I'd love to hear what you think of them; if you enjoy them, what the work is like, how you want to use it in your career. \n\nThanks!",

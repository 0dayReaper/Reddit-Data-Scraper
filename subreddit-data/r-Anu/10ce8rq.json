    "postText": "I'm studying a Bachelor of Arts, beginning my first year in the upcoming semester. I was wondering if any of you would be able to provide some advice on the courses I am planning on taking. I'm looking to major in either politics or philosophy and so am starting off with introductory courses. My specific program requires me to maintain a D/HD average, so some commentary on difficulty and strenuousness would be great!\n\n1. POLS1002 -- Introduction to Politics\n2. PHIL1004 -- Fundamental Ideas in Philosophy: An Introduction\n3. PHIL1008 -- Introduction to Ethics\n4. ASIA1035 -- Introduction to Asian Politics",

    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI am an HSC student living in Sydney and considering going to ANU(assuming my ATAR is high enough), but I have a few questions for current or former ANU students:\n\n1. I am keen on living in a college, but was wondering which to join?\n2. I want to study a law and mathematical science double degree - to anyone doing either/both, what is the workload like? Is it unrealistic to study both of these degrees without spending every waking minute studying?\n3. As a whole, is it worth moving to Canberra, as opposed to staying at home in Sydney and studying at UNSW/USYD? Is there really a college life?\n\nCheers :)",

            "comment": "Hey! \n\n1) You can only put in a preference and so you may not get your choice, however it\u2019s mostly preference, go to open days/ take tours if possible and email the colleges for more photos or to ask questions! \n\n2) Unsure exactly for those degrees. But the beauty of a double degree is that you don\u2019t have any extra workload. Even for a single degree a full time load is still 3-4 subjects a semester \n\n3) There is a huge college life at ANU, given so many students live on campus (this year has been a little different due to COVID but normally there is). \nUltimately it\u2019s up to whether you want to relocate, make new friends, and can afford the move (as you would be paying rent now). I do recommend visiting Canberra and taking tours of ANU/ at least walking around the campus (COVID permitting) to get a feel for the place. I\u2019ve known people who loved moving to Canberra (myself!) and some who moved back home after a year",

            "comment": "Hey OP,\n\nCan't help with Q2, although ill weigh in on the others as im a (sort of) Sydney resident living on campus as a first year.\n\nre college - it comes across that you're looking for an outgoing, social kind of college experience which ANU definitely has to offer, although how full on it is depends on which college you're at. (Obligatory im biased + from Bruce Hall, so I encourage others to weigh in)... although I feel like im pretty objective.\n\nbut basically the key factors to consider are catered vs self-catered, size, facilities, reputation. also FYI, unlike Sydney all any colleges are co-ed.\n\nIf you're looking catered you've got Burg, Johns, Ursula, Wright (14 meals/week) and Bruce. These are all on Daley road, along with B&amp;G  +  Wamburun Which are self catered.  Also fender is not technically on Daley road but similar to the others, and self catered.\n\nThe daley road colleges are all similar in that they're mostly domestic students, mostly 1st, 2nd and some 3rd years, and all get very involved in sport/arts events.\n\nin terms of size, Bruce, Wright + Fenner are the biggest (\\~400-500ppl iirc), and I can't speak for the others, but id image 200ish for most of them, Urisula is smallest at like 150. Bruce + wright are the newest w/ bloody great facilities, fender is pretty new too and also nice, the rest of Daley road is kind of run down - personally having stayed in both Burg + Big, the rooms kind of suck... can't speak for the others.\n\nIf you're looking for something similar to Sydney, Burg + Johns consist largely of private school kids from Syd + Melb - bruce + wright have lots too but not quite as many. I came to Canberra to get away from that scene and do not think I would have enjoyed staying at either johns or burg... that said, I know plenty of people that enjoy it. Contrary to popular belief I do believe you can be a first year at Johns and not drink, it might just be a bit harder to make friends. Also Kevin Rudd went to burg and apparently thats a big deal.\n\nI like bruce because its a bit bigger and has lots of diversity, so you'll probably find that you'll fit in no matter who you are. There are definitely a lot of habits around drinking/going to the pub, although its big enough that its not like thats your only option. Also nobody has been hazing here since like 2015. It is kinda cliquey after a while, but everyone is hella nice and there's always something on.\n\nThe non-daley rd option is Lodge, and people chat a lot of shit about lodge but I made a good group of friends there and they have an awesome time. The residents are generally older and more international students (probably not next year lmao), but you can definitely have a good time there too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary - it STRONGLY FUCKING ADVISE YOU to get your ass out of Sydney just to broaden your horizons and meet some new people and shit. All the people that stay there just stay mates w/ high school friends, and you just gotta grow and learn and shit at some point. If you want a big, social experience, ANU definitely has it... decide how many Sydney people you wanna be surrounded by and pick somewhere on Daley rd. also Moose has $2.50 basics on Thursday nights so theres that to flex on Sydney friends. Hmm if you wanna know more about campus life and shit.\n\nand good luck w/ your HSC lmao, fuck that shit.",

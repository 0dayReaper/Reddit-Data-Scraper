            "comment": "I dont think it would really matter, just a personal preference thing. Also i guess have in mind what kind of weather you want in your exchange country, cause then you can decide whether to go semester 1 or 2. Also side note, you can also organise exchange completely by yourself (see [link](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/careers-opportunities/global-programs/other-semester-length-options/independent-learning)\n\nDoing this is easy (in my experience) and also means you dont have to wait a very long time before you can go exchange. You could literally go the next semester if you wanted to! Hope this helps \ud83d\ude04",

            "comment": "This is an excerpt from an email sent out by the Vice Chancellor today:\n\n&gt;Many of you will have seen publicity around the recently released Shanghai Jiaotong University rankings (SJT). In the latest set of rankings, ANU moved from 59 in the world to 70. I think it important for staff and students to understand the reasons behind such outcomes. The SJT measures a number of quantities including the number of Nobel prizes won by staff and graduates, the number of the most highly cited staff, total number of publications and the number of publications in the journals Nature and Science. There is only a very small correction for size (10 per cent). Hence, the SJT largely measures the total output in each of these areas produced by a university. As a result, for two universities with the same output per staff members, a big university will be more highly ranked than a small institution.\n\n&gt;The change in the position of ANU in these rankings was entirely due to two small impacts. A couple of highly cited researchers left ANU in the past few years, either moving institution or retiring. In addition, our number of publications in Nature and Science dropped very slightly. Because Universities were very closely grouped at this level on the ranking scale, very small changes such as these can have a seemingly disproportionate impact on the overall ranking.\n\n&gt;When corrected for size, ANU ranks 45 in the world on the SJT criteria and remains Australia\u2019s highest ranked university.",

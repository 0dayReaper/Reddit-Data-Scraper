    "postText": "Im doing a double degree with Arts as one of my degrees - all I have left to do is my minor. My other degree is quite hard and I am looking for the easiest possible minor to do so I can focus my efforts on my other degree/work etc.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for a minor that will use up the least of my time? Looking for easy to complete work, a small number of assignments, less classes etc. \n\nAny recommendations would be much appreciated!!",

            "comment": "My advice would be try and find a minor in a subfield of your major that you already enjoy (hopefully!) For example, my major is IR, so I might minor in Security, Peace &amp; Conflict, Human Rights, an Area Studies based course etc. Just make sure you can complete it without having a clash of courses (you can\u2019t count one course for two programs). \n\nOn programs and courses, you can see the assignments for the course. Maybe just pick ones that don\u2019t have exams. This is what I\u2019ll be doing with my 4 remaining arts electives (in addition to picking one\u2019s I think I\u2019ll enjoy - those are my two criteria). If you have 4 courses left, you don\u2019t necessarily need to do a minor - just any 4 electives will do, I was told by CASS.",

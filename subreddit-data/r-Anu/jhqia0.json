    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a Bachelor of Science student major in Computer Science in Melbourne Uni with WAM 74.6. I got offers of Master of Computing (Adv.) from ANU and  Master of IT from unimelb. I also applied Master of Computer Science from unimelb but the cut off WAM is 75. I want to wait for the result of this semester to see whether I'm eligible for master of computer science, but I need to accept ANU's offer before 6th Nov. \n\nSo I'm so confused that should I accept the Master of Computing(Adv) or wait for the result of this semester. Also, what are the differences between two courses and which uni is better in computer science?\n\nThanks everyone!",

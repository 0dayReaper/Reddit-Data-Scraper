    "postText": "I am an international student for both these UNI'S, got Bachelors in International economics and development(4Y) in Uottawa and Bachelors in Economics(3Y) in ANU.\n\nI am in a dilemma, which university should I choose, I really hope you will assist me in getting the insights/ground situation. Which university do you suggest, the fee structure is pretty similar and yea, Uottawa has CO-OP, whereas ANU doesn't have anything like this.\n\nIf you were in my situation, which UNI would you choose? I am also looking for student support, how is the faculty?",

Since ACT has a lot of national players in the league, I think you'll enjoy the challenge of competing against them!\n\nThese are games against other teams in the ACT and games are every week at Lyneham sport centre. Training is on every Thursday from 6:30-8:30. I played this year in the Blues team and enjoyed it very much (covid was a pain though)! Was very similar to what I experienced playing volleyball in highschool and was very fun training with all kinds of people.",

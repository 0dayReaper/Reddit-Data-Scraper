    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI just got accepted into the phb program through early entry but I'm really worried about the HD average. I've seen a few people saying they got kicked out of the program for not meeting the average and now I'm considering just staying here in Melbourne if I'm not going to be able to keep it up (as moving to canberra will be very expensive, and I would only really be willing to pay if I was in the phb). What are everyone's thoughts on this? I've also seen that the average you need for advanced science is only 5% lower anyway, which makes it seem like the HD should be achievable?",

            "comment": "Hey OP ex-PhB student here (views are my own but obviously biased). For your first semester (and potentially year) your marks do not count towards the PhB average because the staff understand that you're still adjusting to Uni life etc. I know students who've had rough semesters and didn't get the average, but usually if there's reasons for it (eg personal, family, illness etc) then you certainly won't get kicked out. I was really daunted about the average at first but once I got into the groove of research and coursework it made it a lot easier. If you're struggling academically (regardless of if you stay in Melbourne or come to Canberra), I strongly recommending underloading by a course - it gives you more space to focus on your remaining subjects and better work life balance, and you can catch up to your other peers by doing courses in summer/winter etc. Hope this helps! You'll smash it :)",

            "comment": "To be honest it probably heavily depends what you're studying. Take a massive grain of salt with this but I graduated BEng in 2015 with a distinction average. In getting those grades I barely attended lectures, slept through the others, and avoided tutorial wherever possible (don't let this one sentence mislead you, there was a shit load of work too). I have a few mates who graduated with HD averages. I don't think they necessarily understood the material better than me (or a lot of the cohort) , but they were definitely more organised and more invested in the grades. They would put in the extra hours to scrape those few extra marks to consistently go from a D to a HD. If you're this worried before even getting to ANU I'm sure you're the sort of person who will attend tutes, go to office hours, study productively in their own time, etc. Doing those things consistently and applying yourself to the best of your ability will almost certainly lead to a lot of HD's.",

That means you've submitted better assessment than 8/10 of your peers (on average).\n\nYou'd have to be well planned and committed throughout,  is that the uni experience you're looking for? Three or four subjects a semester,  maybe 3 pieces of assessment plus an exam depending on the course and you've got to nail them all.",

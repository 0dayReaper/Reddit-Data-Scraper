    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm an interstate student who just got offered a place at Wamburun hall for 2023. I was wondering how good the culture/ ammenities are. For reference i am someone who loves to cook and play sports. But, i am a little introverted and want to be in hall where it is easy to connect with people. I am also some who values being able to have occasional alone time\n\nAny general insight into Wamburun would be really helpful.",

            "comment": "Not a Wamba resident but here are some comments from my friends living there. Wamba isn't exactly great in terms of living conditions (meh rooms, shared kitchen/bathroom and shopping for groceries is kinda inconvenient). I visited a few times, and I'd say the Unilodge residences are much more comfortable. However, the social/culture aspect of Wamba is pretty strong with a very close-knit community, but you won't be forced to socialise if you don't want to. You will definitely find people you can play sports with, and if you are willing to cook for others you are probably going to have a good time there.",

The showers and toilets are not always clean, and the kitchen gets dirty real fast during cooking times. However, the kitchen is among the best places to chat with friends and make new ones. The community culture encourages looking out for one another as well. It's a mixed bag really.",

            "comment": "Hi, I just finished my first year and spent the whole time at Wamburun. I'm quite tall, so I requested a corner room with a king single bed (as opposed to most rooms with doubles, which are larger). The room was quite small, even cramped at times. I have friends still in the hall for another few days, so you're welcome to DM and I can arrange for photos or a video call so you can check out the rooms, bathroom and kitchen with an actual ressie. \n\nOverall, the bathrooms weren't the best (again happy to give more detail), and the kitchen could be quite uncleanly at times. \n\nThat said, I hugely enjoyed my time at Wamba, and am very grateful I went there. This year the hall had a huge international community (I would guess 65+%), and meeting people of all cultures was really cool. We also have postgrads in the hall which is really nice. They often give great advice and a cool perspective on things which I really enjoyed. I spent a huge amount of time cooking this year, and the kitchens were amazing for meeting new people. Making friends there is incredibly easy if you're willing to talk to people. I feel like I've rambled long enough, but TLDR facilities and management feel sub-par, but the community was really amazing and made up for it imo. Feel free to DM for more info and good luck!",

    "postText": "Couldn't find any info on ANU/unilodge websites so I thought I'd post here. I've received an accommodation offer for Lena Karmel, and will (hopefully) be in a shared apartment. I play bass guitar in my free time and am hoping to bring it + a small amp with me next year. Are there any specific rules/policies around keeping instruments in rooms? Are amps considered fire hazards? Mine has a headphone jack so I don't think noise would be a problem. I know LK has a music room but I'd prefer to be able to play in my room out of convenience, if possible. \n\nAlso, are record players annoying to have/bring? I know the rooms in shared apartments aren't the biggest, but I have a few records that are sentimental to me and it'd be nice to be able to play them. Thanks :)",

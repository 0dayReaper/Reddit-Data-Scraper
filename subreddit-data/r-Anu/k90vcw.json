    "postText": "I'm a year 12 who has been accepted into the NUS/ANU joint Bachelor of Philosophy (Honours) / Bachelor of Science (Honours) and looking at studying the physics major it offers. \n\nI also applied to the UNSW with the Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours)/Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) - full time as my top preference and anticipate that I will be accepted into this program. \n\nI enjoyed high school physics quite a lot but have heard that university physics is quite different, so I am looking at the possibility of studying computer science as well, hence the computer science double at UNSW. \n\nDoes anyone have any insights into which university would be better from physics or computer science? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t really compare with other unis but I took both physics and computer science courses in my first year. (I only took one course for computer science). I took physics in high school, but it was not Australian high school so my comment on how much they differ might be inaccurate. I had pretty much zero knowledge in computer science. \n \nIn the first computer science course (COMP1100 or COMP1130), you\u2019ll learn to use Haskell and since no one really uses that language, everyone starts from the same level and it\u2019s chill. I find it to be pretty fun course but assignments were so much harder than exams and lecture materials and that\u2019s the only bad thing I can remember. I can\u2019t remember exactly but from next level course, the popular language (I think it was C or Java) became the main focus and since I had no knowledge in that, I got scared so I stopped CS. \n\nThe first physics course (PHYS1101) was just a revision of high school material and getting to know how to use lab and write lab report. Then the new materials will be introduced from next course (PHYS1201 ) like Euler language.",

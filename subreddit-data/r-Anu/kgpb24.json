Thanks :)",

When applying for the JD I only had the one choice, that being the JD at ANU. \n\nMore info and entry requirements can be located here - https://law.anu.edu.au/study/study-programs/juris-doctor\n\nJust be aware that I believe the college is moving all compulsory subjects to in-person teaching only for the JD by 2024...no idea why they went down this path.",

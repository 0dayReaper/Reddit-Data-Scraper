I toured a lot of the colleges but personally I felt that B&amp;G had the best energy of all of them (except maybe Fenner). My biggest concern is that the shower cubicles don\u2019t have a bench in them to put your things on hahah. Honestly I\u2019m pretty much sold on it personally. I didn\u2019t think it seemed dead, the vibe was really good in my opinion!",

The PhB cohort is alot smaller than other degrees so it's alot easier to make a group chat compared to how many people would be doing finance or commerce. But if you want, there is an ANU student discord ([https://discord.com/invite/GwtFCap](https://discord.com/invite/GwtFCap)) that you may be able to join.",

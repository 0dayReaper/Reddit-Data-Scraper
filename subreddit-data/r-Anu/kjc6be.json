    "postText": "Hey, I received an offer for advanced science (hons) at ANU starting this February. Although I received an offer for the exact same degree at UNSW, the commute from home (central coast) borders on 2 hours of buses and trains just to get there. The tedious journey+ a relative lack of the 'uni' experience at UNSW have convinced me to choose ANU instead. \n\nHowever, I have some concerns about financial stability; is going on centrelink programs (youth+rent allowance), as well as hopefully getting a part time job enough to keep me afloat? Or will I need some other source of income / savings to survive even at the bare minimum? For reference, rent will likely be about $290 / week. I imagine a majority of undergrads at the uni don't have scholarships or external financial support, but if I'm wrong I may have to reconsider my decision to move down to Canberra. Anyways, thanks in advance for an answer :)",

My rent was obscene because I was at an expensive college but it's absolutely doable. You'll have to be organised and juggle work/uni/social life (which sometimes takes a toll because you can't do everything your friends do if your broke or busy LOL) but it's so doable. I recently moved into a sharehouse and I'm living without Centrelink! I would definitely reccomend making sure you can still get Centrelink because it's tested on your parental income when your younger than 22, even if you don't live with them!",

Why do people say it lacks the \"university experience\"?\n\nTwo hours is not a reasonable commute, if living near ANU is cheaper than living near UNSW then that is easily your best option.",

That makes sense, I'm glad regular rent isn't that high yet. \n\nI was paying $380 for a nice 2 bdr in Turner two years ago.\n\nOn campus accommodation is expensive because rich people are happy to pay it for an American-style \"college\" life and because foreigners are happy to pay it rather than navigate a Byzantine (and racist) rental market. \n\nYou'll save money moving off campus without missing much. I'd say cancel your on campus lease ASAP (after the first semester is pretty typical) and save your money. Unless of course you really love dorms, in which case knock yourself out.",

Lots of students I know take a part time load (3 courses/sem) so they can work some more hours during the week and help pay for everything. Regarding jobs, the Maccas in Braddon is 20 minutes walk from campus and ALWAYS hiring. Other restaurants/bars are good places to look too, but most people I know got their jobs through friends. It can take a few months to find something.",

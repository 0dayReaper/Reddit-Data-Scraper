    "postText": "\nHi all, I am going to join ANU, Canberra in feb 2023. I am looking for residencies on campus but I am confused as to which one to select. I am looking for someplace affordable( prolly within $330) and has good basic amenities. If anyone has gone there and has any suggestion i would be glad.",

            "comment": "Your only option at that price point is going to be BNG, possibly Wamburun, or a six share in one of the UniLodges. That means a shared kitchen, no dining hall, and a shared bathroom. Your room will have a bed, a sink, a desk and a wardrobe. All the colleges mentioned have okay culture, but be prepared because you\u2019re not paying at the $400 mark the amenities aren\u2019t going to be the best maintained and are shared. \n\nI myself am a former Bruce Hall resident, I paid roughly $430 a week in main wing for updated amenities and catering. It is going up in cost for 2024, to over $500 a week I believe. All the halls are increasing in price significantly for 2023. Good luck!",

There is a daily market in Kambri which is about five minutes walk, and a Coles in civic which is about half an hour walk or ten mins by bus and walk from ANU Barry Drive bus stop on the R2, R3, or R4 to city interchange. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s only fair to warn you that BNG is the most affordable but you definitely get what you pay for. My friend who lived in BNG had three toilets that she shared with her whole pod, one of which didn\u2019t have a seat, didn\u2019t flush and didn\u2019t ever have loo paper, and another which was designated the \u2018vomit\u2019 toilet because it was the one that didn\u2019t have a door and that all the drunk students would vomit into. There was only one working toilet effectively for her whole pod of 20 people. The rooms are really small and old, and sometimes the locks don\u2019t work so my friend had her undies stolen by a perv once. \n\nIf you\u2019re willing to spend a bit more I\u2019d recommend one of the other halls honestly, living at BNG is hard. Most people I know who\u2019ve lived there have only made it a year before moving somewhere else because BNG is so hard to live in sometimes. Not to diss BNG but I don\u2019t think I could live there.",

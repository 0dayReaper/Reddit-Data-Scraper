We have some heavyweight philosophers at ANU and it's extremely rewarding learning from them. There's a heavy analytical philosophy edge but we also have a very wide range of electives if there's certain topics that interest you: e.g. philosophy of Buddhism or philosophy of gender etc. I personally think philosophy has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my degree and would highly reccomend it! Can't really comment on maths though!",

I don't mind the maths being more rigorous/difficult so that sounds good to me.\n\nI was just wondering what you meant by catering to the PPE kids? I'm not sure what this would look like in practice. Do those students dictate which courses are run? \n\nAlso it's a little worrying to hear that analytic philosophy isn't as strong considering I'm fairly interested in the areas you mentioned. What would you say makes those lectures \"duds\"?\n\nAgain, thanks for your reply.",

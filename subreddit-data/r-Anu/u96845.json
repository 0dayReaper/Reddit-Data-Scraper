    "postText": "How is it like studying a Bachelor of Arts (majoring in Psychology) at ANU? Academic rigour, professors, career opportunities, making friends, getting into honours, anything really! Also, is a double major recommended, or a major+minor combination better? Any recommendations for majors/minors? :) \n\nAdditionally, how does housing work as a Semester 2 international student? I understand that prices differ depending on the type of residence, but do we have to pay for all 44 weeks (since a semester is only ~28 weeks and right after is a long summer break)?",

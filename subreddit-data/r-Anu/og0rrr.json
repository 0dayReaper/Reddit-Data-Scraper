                    "comment": "I think a lot of complaints about the ANU engineering program stem from the strange choices for majors, as the ANU does not offer a mechanical, civil or chemical major. Instead, they have strange choices, which often seem like inferior derivatives of other majors, for examples renewable systems vs. a standard mechanical major. Also, another thing is ANU engineering is very computer heavy, although this is favorable for mechatronics anyway.",

However, there is a lot of cool research going on if you are super interested in it. Overall, I would advise to go somewhere else. ANU has strength in research rather than teaching. That gets really annoying for shit course after shit course.",

If you want to do ADFA (assuming by that you mean defence, and not the civilian program offered at UNSW Canberra) the entry requirements are much higher as you basically need to be in perfect health.",

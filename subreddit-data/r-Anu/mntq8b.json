However I hold a firm belief that university is not the way to go if you want to learn to speak a language. University, particularly a minor will teach you all the grammar rules, which is useful if you want to become proficient in writing academia, however to converse, it is much easier and more effective to spend your own time doing it and speaking to people online in the target language. I learn far more this way",

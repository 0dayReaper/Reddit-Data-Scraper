    "postText": "I received an early entry offer from ANU for the PhB (Science) but I'm having a lot of difficulty deciding between the PhB and other courses (other research degrees/medicine). I did IB instead of VCE, so I was only able to take two sciences. I took chemistry and biology but I'm also interested in environmental and marine science and physics. Is there an opportunity to explore different majors in the PhB before deciding, or would I have to decide on a major early on?\n\nAlso, are philosophy units required or is that just the name of the course because it's a research degree?",

            "comment": "Caveat: my info may be a little out of date (I graduated 12 years ago).\n\nNo philosophy units are required; the name indicates that this is a degree with a research component (i.e. advanced studies courses), like an M.Phil. or a Ph.D.\n\nYou definitely have the opportunity to explore different majors, and plenty of students don't settle on a major until later on in their degree. The main thing is that you need to take six ASCs before the beginning of your honours year. But these don't all need to be in the same major. So you can spend your first year or two taking science courses in several different fields before settling on one subfield that you want to do an honours thesis in.",

            "comment": "3rd year in PhB science doing physics here. What they stress the most with PhB Science is your ability to be multidisciplinary, so they love when you do lots of different things, and I'm pretty sure the course doesn't even require you have a major by the end (I'm pretty sure). So it sounds like a good fit to what you want. And a correction to another comment here, you have to do 6 ASC/ASEs, at least 3 have to be ASCs. ASCs are research projects where you get a supervisor who is currently doing research and complete some research of your own with their guidance, it is very cool and you get a lot of good experience. ASEs are extensions on courses you're already doing, like some extra hard homework questions or a mini project about the course content. Hope that helps! Feel free to reach out and ask me any questions if you like.",

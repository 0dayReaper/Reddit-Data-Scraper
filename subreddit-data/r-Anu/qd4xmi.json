    "postText": "Hey I'm currently in the process of looking at degrees and I was wondering if R &amp; D would be any good. I'm super interesting in the research and development side of engineering so I would love to do this degree although I have a few concerns, what kind of jobs are available? Is it too broad as it doesn't really specialise in any field?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "It has (had? It's been a few years) a very high ATAR cutoff and you have to maintain an HD average across all your engineering courses, so it's a lot of work. Having said that, research projects are some of most interesting things I did at uni and are probably by far and away the best and most realistic engineering learning I did. \n\nThe whole engineering course has a focus on systems engineering which is kind of like 'generalised' engineering. Personally I really liked that and I've found that it's a great basis for any engineering job post-uni, but not everyone agrees.",

Unilodge is pretty dead with regards to partying unless you find a group of friends who love to party with you as well (based on experience; it\u2019s still pretty easy to find this group of friends). B&amp;G/ Ursula main wing/Wamburun. You would wanna look at basically the halls and not unilodge!",

Cost is also a big factor.\r  \nI have heard good things about BnG. Wamburun, Bruce and Wright are also common choices. You can\u2019t go too wrong tbh.",

            "comment": "OP, also give some consideration to what's important to you in accommodation.  \nFirstly, there are two kinds: catered and uncatered (technically a third kind called flexi-catered which I think Wright Hall is). Catered is good because you don't have to worry about cooking, but also consider if you eat at unusual times or have a busy schedule, you'll be paying extra for meals you can't even have. And I mean a LOT extra.  \nSecondly, do you prefer a social experience? Unilodge is good for having facilities all to yourself, but the social experience is a bit...lacking. B&amp;G, Wamburun etc have excellent resident committees which means parties and youll never be bored, but you also have to share facilities like bathrooms and kitchens which means you might not get heaps of alonetime. FWIW, I'd personally recommend B&amp;G, Fenner, or Wamburun. They're not as pricy as the rest, the communities are friendly, and you get the quintessential \"college\" experience.",

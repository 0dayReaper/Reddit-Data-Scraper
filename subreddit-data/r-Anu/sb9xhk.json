    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am a 2022 first year and I'm studying a bachelor of politics, philosophy and economics. I've been setting out my timetable on the unofficial website and I was wondering if someone could explain to me what elective course I should take? I understand I can choose either a minor, major or a specialization as my elective but I'm just confused on what to do - and whether I can change it later on? And do I have to take two majors if I was wanting to do honours etc?\n\nDoes anyone have any advice about what I should do? I'm just really overwhelmed with everything and am confused on how my elective would sit in my timetable. Any help would be much appreciated :))))",

            "comment": "Hi OP! I'm a third year PPE/Arts student. For elective courses, you can choose any course that you would like to take - anything that piques your interest, etc. You can choose a minor, major or a specialisation but you're not required to, but if you want to take a major, like just taking regular elective courses you can really choose whatever you want to study. If you're doing a single PPE degree, you have enough space in terms of your elective courses to do a single major. For example, when I was doing a single PPE degree, I chose to do a history major, because I felt that I would enjoy doing it.   \n\n\nIn terms of changing your major/minor, as long as you have space in your degree to do so, it should be able to change it on ISIS, and even if you don't declare it on ISIS, as long as you meet the requirements and have taken the necessary courses for a major/minor you should be able to graduate with one.  \n\n\nAs far as doing a PPE honours, I don't think you need to do 2 majors, but I know there are some other requirements.  \n\n\nIf you need any specific advice, it's probably best to contact your college's student office. You should be able to contact them here: [students.cass@anu.edu.au](mailto:students.cass@anu.edu.au) .  \n\n\nIf you need any more help, feel free to DM me.",

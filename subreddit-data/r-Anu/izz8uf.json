    "postText": "Hey everyone, apologies if this comes across as dumb, I have very little knowledge when it comes to university and the research I\u2019ve done online has left me with more questions then answers so I\u2019m hoping you may be able to help.\n\nI\u2019m a year 11 student and I\u2019m hoping to get into some kind of medical science and I\u2019m curious about what course I should be looking into as well as information about the bridge course and ATAR requirements.\n\nA bit of context, I dropped out at year 10, worked for a year and then came back for year 11/12 which meant that I chose my electives way after everyone else so I was unable to do some as they were full or didn\u2019t run. This meant that not only was I unable to do biology, I was also stuck with classes that I\u2019m not necessarily great at.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n\u2022How does minimum ATAR for courses work? because for medical science it said I would need 85, but the lowest they\u2019ve ever accepted was 79 and the average is 90.\n\n\u2022Would the bridge course be worthwhile? \nAs I don\u2019t do biology but I was able to do chemistry.\n\n\u2022Should I be doing a double degree?\n\n\u2022Anything about Majors and Minors and where I can find information on them?\n\n\u2022And finally is bachelor of medical science the course I should be looking at or is there something more suited?\n\nApologies again if any of these are dumb questions or if I structured this badly and any additional information would be very much appreciated.\nThank you",

            "comment": "First year student here!\nI\u2019m doing an arts degree so I can\u2019t answer everything relating to your specific degree but I\u2019ll give some general pointers.\n \nMy general understanding of ATAR acceptance is that they have the general requirement they have on the course page isn\u2019t a cut off, it says you need an 85 which I\u2019ve always assumed meant that if you get 85 you\u2019ll be accepted. 79 is the actual cut off, if you\u2019re bellow that they might not consider you for that course. Again I\u2019m not 100% sure on this, I assumed that this was true and got in but it might not be, if you have a school careers advisor they would probably have a better understanding than me.\n\nNot sure about bridge course, I\u2019d again suggest talking to a career advisor about it or emailing student enquiries.\n\nYou don\u2019t HAVE to do a double degree if you don\u2019t want to, if you\u2019re interested in studying a different topic as well as medical science then go for it.\n\nI\u2019d suggest going to the ANU degree builder website [ANU degree builder](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/degree-builder) and then going to the specific degree page that you\u2019re interested in and go into the study tab, it\u2019ll list all the courses you\u2019ll need to take in order to complete that degree. It\u2019ll also outline the majors/minors that you can do and course requirements for that, as well as a general outline of how you could structure your semesters. You don\u2019t have to follow it perfectly but it gives you a general idea of what you can do. The course study tabs have been a really helpful recourse for me personally!\n\nNot sure what you\u2019re hoping to get out of your degree and I know nothing about medical science, the degree builder lists all of the degrees offered in a specific area of interest so it might be helpful to look at all your options.\n\nNot any dumb questions! My biggest suggestions would be to use your recourses at school: advisors, teachers, etc. because they probably have a better understanding of things like ATAR requirements work. Personally I had a specific teacher help me out a lot, she helped me apply for early acceptance and gave me a lot of advice on what I should be doing to get into my degree. Maybe talk to your science teacher, they probably have experienced other students trying to get into a similar field and could give you some good advice.\n\nGood luck!",

I may also be wrong though so definitely check online or with a careers advisor.",

    "postText": "Gday\n\nDoes anyone have experience dropping from an FDD and just pursuing one of their degrees? For EG, from IR/Arts to just IR? \n\nHere\u2019s my question:\n\nSay you have an atar of 84 and you were admitted to the IR/Arts based off of bonus points, and then decided you wanted to drop the Arts and just pursue the IR, would they reject your request because your raw atar is below the 85 threshold even though you are already enrolled into that degree? I ask this because it says only your raw atar will be considered in a transfer.\n\nI would find it odd if they wouldn\u2019t allow you to pursue one of the degrees you are already in over such a technicality.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to reach out to the uni a few weeks ago but haven\u2019t heard any response yet. I\u2019m also not enrolled this sem.\n\nAny advice would be of serious help.\n\nCheers\n\nEDITED:\n\nHas anyone transferred degrees without completing any courses before?",

Assuming you get solid grades in that time it's unlikely they will knock you back. Generally within limits once you are in the system and show you can do uni study ok they will keep you and let you do what you want.\n\nIf you for sure want to drop back to just one later you just make sure that all electives you take are actually only from the single degree you want to change to later.",

I also did high scaling subjects at a well scaling school, and in y11 had 95s in NSW maths advanced and English advanced, 90 in physics and extension maths, 90 in Design Tech and 80 in English extension 1. I think a lot of people got higher y11 selection ranks than their final atar. What course are you aiming for?",

They don't actually preference applicants based on who has done \"more\" extracurricular activities. As long as you've done the bare minimum to tick the co-curricular or service box, then they don't really look at it beyond that.\n\nSorry this info isn't much use to you now, but hopefully might help any Year 12 students reading this.",

I was saying that, from memory, meeting whatever minimum requirements asked when having no warning and little expectation of what they would be was a negative experience. At the time I participated in an national level sport and also worked, and I remember still (almost) not meeting the minimum service requirements despite having a full working and training schedule. the only reason i did meet was because i\u2019d been volunteering at my school for a time and had teachers willing to sign off on it. \nhope this clears up everything! Now that the early entry system is better established I believe the process will move smoother and the requirements will be easily found and communicated to current entrants.",

About a week before ANU early entry applications closed I suddenly changed career plans and thought \u201cwhat the hell\u201d and submitted an application for bachelor of engineering, not expecting a response. My prediction ATAR was only 78 and the classes I was taking were continuing Japanese, english, specialist maths, biology and chemistry. I think ANU was desperate for more students because they didn\u2019t have many international students this year, so they accepted me, who I don\u2019t think would usually get in.\n\nEdit: I think my entry ATAR got scaled up a bit because I speak almost fluent Japanese, and I went to Canberra college if that helps.",

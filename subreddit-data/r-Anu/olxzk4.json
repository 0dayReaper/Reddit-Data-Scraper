However, it seems to be a recurring theme online that I should stay away from Engineering at ANU.\n\nI was just curious if that was true, and if so, why/why not? Is it because of the way that it is taught or that the course is not relevant to the industry/too niche?",

That being said, there's no dedicated civil engineering course at ANU. Would you say that I'd be better off studying engineering somewhere else?",

If you want to do electrical/electronics, then my impression from sitting over in the CS side of the engineering faculty was that it seemed alright.",

Also, if you are renewables and environmental systems are quite different. At the ANU at least, renewables is closer to a traditional mech degree, which environmental just seems to like a civil and environmental degree minus the civil.",

The only thing offered by ANU that is not offered by UNSW (I think) is humanitarian engineering, which is only offered as a minor anyway.",

            "comment": "As someone who is currently studying engineering at the ANU, I do agree that the program is very computer based. During the first two years of the program, you will study all the same courses independent of major, and this includes two COMP courses (or near enough), and many others containing computer simulation. Of the 4 available majors, two of them (electrical and comms. and mechatronic) are very computer based. I cannot speak of environmental as much, however, the only other major choice, being renewable energy systems, strikes me as a very strange choice. \n\nTo address your question about negative sentiment online, I think these strange major choices are the main cause, as the ANU does not even offer a proper mechanical, civil or chemical major, and recently removed the biomedical major for incoming students. Why a mechanical major is not offered with the choice of a renewable minor is imo a bad decision, and the same with a civil with environmental minor.",

Most of the courses are badly run by lecturers that really don't care eg. ENGN3331 system dynamics. There are a few exceptions, like ENGN2229 which was amazing but has recently been discontinued. I did the mechatronics major which was very computer focused, so concur with lots of the other comments. But the culling of almost all of the majors just show how very little ANU care about engineering.",

However, I\u2019ve heard the the person in charge of designing (for lack of a better term) the major is an aerodynamic researcher who had experience working with aero stuffs in F1 teams (Ferrari and Williams). I guess that implies that the people designing this major know what students will need to excel in this engineering field and how the students can achieve that as they\u2019ve been in the industry previously. \n\nI think the major will be curated by capable hands but I doubt it\u2019ll be smooth sailing for CECS, ANU, lecturers and students for the first few years",

She got A's in year 11 and was one of the highest in the cohort, however she wasn't in the top 2% as we are from a small regional school and to reach that percentile range she would have to had be the top student.",

My cohort was pretty big, I went to an inner city public high school. I highly doubt you\u2019d need to be in the top 2% overall, especially if your cohort is smaller :)",

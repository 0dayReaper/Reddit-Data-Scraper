    "postText": "Hi, so basically I'm interested in applying to medicine however, I completely bombed my UCAT. I applied to the ANU early admissions round and I got into a Bachelor of Health Science (LSR=97.25). This course only accepts 60 students, of which, up to 30 can be selected for postgrad entry into medicine without GAMSAT depending on their GPA at university. On the other hand, I can do a Bachelor of Biomed or Science at UniMelb (LSR=90.50). The ANU course sounds very tempting but Canberra is a really small and boring city and I've been there before (several times), I do not think I would enjoy living there. Whereas, Melbourne seems like a nicer city to live in, with better city life. The downside for Melbourne is I would have to do the GAMSAT which honestly sounds like a nightmare. I'm also interested in other opportunities in Melbourne such as their exchange program (I'm fluent in Japanese so I'd love to go to Japan). This is hard for me and I'm not sure which to pick. It would be great if someone could provide me with helpful insights!",

I bombed UMAT/UCAT in year 12 that obviously affected my chances that year. When I came to ANU I actually sat the UMAT again and it went much better. Pretty sure it was because of my experiences getting out of home and live with other students etc (Canberra has a solid student nightlife). Not telling you what to choose but I know you'll figure out and in the big scheme of things a few years here and there won't mean too much. Enjoy your Uni days! :)",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a NSW Year 12 student and I\u2019m interested in studying a Double Degree in Classics and Political Science at ANU next year. I was really looking forward to it because ANU has a dedicated Bachelor of Classical Studies but it will be removed from 2023. \n\nI was wondering if anyone could provide their experience/insight or advice into studying Classics at ANU, as I\u2019m also applying to the University of Sydney. I\u2019ve preferenced ANU because of the dedicated Classics course but now I\u2019ve been advised to apply for an Arts degree with a Major in Latin/Greek, which would now be the same as at Sydney.\n\nThanks!",

Still, recommend if you're interested! They also have partnerships with a lot of classics places to train with around the world.",

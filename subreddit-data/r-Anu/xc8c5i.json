    "postText": "I\u2019ve received an early offer for next year and I plan on studying science and political science. I got offered a place at Kinloch, which I\u2019m not too keen on as I\u2019d prefer some sort of catering. I had a look at Burgmann at open day and it seemed pretty good, I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with them? How true is the whole Sydney/Melbourne rich kid stereotype (bit intimidating as a regional student)?\n\nThanks in advance :)",

            "comment": "As a Lena Kamel resident I\u2019d recommend Kinloch (which is very similar to Lena as a unilodge residence) over Burgmann mostly because of the living conditions. \n1. Burgmann has no air-conditioning (only central heating), which may be very uncomfortable during summer.\n2. Communal bathroom/showers for Burgmann\n3. You pay a lot more for catering, which is probably more than what you\u2019d spend on self-catering or even eating out a few times a week. \n\nBurgmann as an academic college is a lot more close-knit than unilodge, and may provide you with a lot more social opportunities and support. So it may be the choice for you if you are a very social person and rarely stay inside your room. You still get lots of social opportunities in Kinloch, but you\u2019ll need to actively participate. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s the kind of \u201cstereotype\u201d you\u2019re talking about, but I guess that does mean it\u2019s not too big of an issue. Most people are nice regardless of where they are from and I very rarely find myself caring about what other people\u2019s status are. (But damn, some international students really are hella rich)",

Still a bit of a private school vibe but there's a lot of rural/non sydney people - would 100% recommend over kinloch where you won't meet many people. The community at burg is great and there's a ton of nice people to meet and events to go to which everyone gets around. I have heard the application process is quite competitive so give them a call and see where they're at, and check the dates for change of accom preference",

            "comment": "Hey, I'm at Burg now coming from the same sort of situation as you. I am also from a regional background but absolutely love it at Burg. Not being biased, but it has the best culture with a mix of social events, co-curricular activities, and focused study with a bunch of like-minded people in study spaces.\n\nFrom what I've heard, it is a lot harder to get these sorts of benefits from places like UniLodge but it definitely has its benefits like private bathrooms, self-catering, and stuff like that.\n\nI wouldn't be too worried about that sort of culture/stereotype stuff, genuinely that sort of cliquey dynamics are reserved for Ursies and Johns - as I've heard from friends from there - but Burg is perfect since everyone is from diverse backgrounds. While yeah, most people are stupidly rich, there are plenty of low SES people like me who have had the same struggles. The best part about Burg is the fact that it isn't cliquey and most people who brag about their wealth heaps are shunned by the majority of Burg. In fact, I have friends who actively hide how much money their family has lol.\n\nAnyway, it's totally up to you but I'll just say that Burg has been such an amazing experience. I was actually touring Open Day, so I might've seen you there or even given you a tour haha",

            "comment": "First, congrats on your offer!\n\nThe catered Halls/Colleges have a wonderful sense of tight-knit community. Kinloch / other UniLodges are good if you prefer a sense of independence (or being left alone).\n\n\\- Burgmann people are going to be mostly lovely and you'll have a great time. But of the Colleges, they are *probably* at the upper end of privilege *on average*. That means they might not need to get part-time jobs (or work as much) and can devote more time to extracurriculars, societies, sports, student politics etc. etc.\n\n\\- Because they are 'selective' and only affiliated, not owned by ANU, Burgmann and Johns definitely have the 'private school' vibe, with Johns having the sports stereotype and Burgmann the arts/law and student politics stereotype (their sports teams are called, I think, the Burgmann Black Cats, but should be called the Burgmann Barristers).\n\n\\- This is anecdotal, but I was a regional NSW kid. My closest friends from College are a mix of well-off elite Sydney and Melbourne backgrounds, other country kids from Dubbo or Orange, exchange students etc. I am not claiming that Uni access is equitable to lower SES backgrounds, but wherever you end up, your background shouldn't matter very much.",

            "comment": "UniLodges are great for building independence, and there is a vibrant community to get involved with if you desire (for Lodge, it\u2019s the person who makes the experience and you do have to make a small effort to attend events and such if you want to meet people. Otherwise it can be isolating if you choose to just stay in your room.) Lodge as a whole isn\u2019t as private school ruled as some of the other halls, and good mix of international/domestic as well as undergrad/postgrad. We also have a lot more students not from Sydney (VIC/QLD/SA especially) Wanting catering is fair enough, but in the long term, self-catering is cheaper and better for developing skills for when you move off campus. \n\nI\u2019m doing political science at a Lodge and most of my classes are less then a 10 minute walk from here. Probably be a bit further from Burg. We\u2019re also much better located to Civic for shopping and entertainment",

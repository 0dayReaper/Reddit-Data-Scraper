            "comment": "&gt; how is the comp science/it program in anu compared to unsw?\n\nThe general consensus is that ANU provides more theory and less practice. \n\nUNSW's Bachelor of Computer Science also only takes 3 years while ANU's Bachelor of Advanced Computing takes 4 years because you have to do Honours. \n\nHonours is valuable if you are thinking of grad school.\n\n&gt; are there a lot of self taught coders. already in first year?\n\nWhen I was in 1st year there were a few self taught coders. I would say the majority hadn't coded before or had very limited knowledge.\n\nThe first CS course COMP1100/1130 is in Haskell (functional programming), which is a completely different paradigm to what we normally program in and can trip up a lot of students who already know how to code.\n\n&gt; will I be at a disadvantage if I dont know how to code from before hand in anu?\n\nNo, but knowing how to code would make courses a bit easier.\n\n&gt; how are the job prospects in canberra?\n\nThere are jobs but not at the big tech companies most people think about like Atlassian, Amazon, Facebook, Google, etc. \n\nThere are a lot of companies working as government contractors, some bigger 'traditional' tech companies (Oracle, IBM, etc.) and also a few local tech companies and startups here and there - e.g. Instaclustr, Seeing Machines. I believe Palantir also has an office in Canberra.\n\nThat being said, you would have better luck finding a job in Sydney and you would get paid higher as well.",

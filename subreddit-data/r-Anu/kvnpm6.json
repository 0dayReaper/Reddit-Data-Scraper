    "postText": "When I first applied to ANU my first preference was the bachelor of philosophy (Phb), and my second was actuarial studies. I did not in any way expect to get into the phb program and had my heart set on going into actuarial... but then my results came in, my selection rank was 99.95 and I ended up getting into the phb program despite really wanting to do actuarial. Additionally because of corona the application rounds were pushed back so while I would normally get another round to apply to the course I really want this January, I do not get that opportunity. This was in large part my own fault but I really did not think I would get that high of a result. I would love to do the phb but I do not see any viable pathway to a decent paying career which makes it really unattractive for me.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1. Is there a way for me to apply for courses in my phb relevant to actuarial studies such that I can switch to actuarial studies later without having to start from scratch?\n\n2. Are there any careers that I can use the phb as a pathway too with a fairly high salary and good hiring prospects?",

But i can tell you who can\nDuring O week course advisers do open sessions, usually on tuesdays for those who need help (at least thats the way with CASS)\nTheyll tell you to fill out a rough plan, but youll probably need help with that. You can look at programs and courses for more info.\n\nAnd if youre doing a single degree I believe it should come with 8 \"electives\" and there may be one or two courses you can overlap. In the degree as well.\nIm not 100% on this part though, i never needed to change",

However, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that i can switch to act aci or any other subject. It works out well for me tho",

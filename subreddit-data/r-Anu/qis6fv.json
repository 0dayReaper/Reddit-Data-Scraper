    "postText": "Hi r/ANU! \n\nMay I ask, what are the chances for an international student to obtain a scholarship with an IB score of 42/45 (approx ATAR 99), and a strong extracurricular background (Student Government, Model United Nations, Service and Chairty organization leadership)? I've read that extracurricular's doesn't matter as much in Aus compared to the US/Canada, so I'm not very sure about how that would factor in. \n\nAdditionally, I'm thinking of applying to the PhB program in both the humanities and sciences, and would like to know if my score is competitive enough. \n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "This is just speculation so don't take it as fact:\n\nThe score should be high enough to get into the PhB program, but probably isn't for a scholarship. From what I've seen you'd need a 44+ if you don't have other socio-economic factors that could contribute (like being poor or living in a rural area).",

Living costs as well, I hope I can enter a fully or flex catered residence for my first year at least until I settle in, but if cash is tighter, I might have to settle with self catered, or find a rent asap...\n\nMy family is neither too rich to afford high end education, neither are they poor enough to be eligible for welfare programs... Just in the middle. It doesn't help that my father is not too supportive of me studying overseas, expecting me to cover most of the expenses (which I don't have much saved to cover)...\n\nIs there any plans available for a tuition grant, or financial aid provided by the Uni other than scholarships? It seems like scholarships will be very competitive and my scores aren't exactly exemplary by ANU standards...",

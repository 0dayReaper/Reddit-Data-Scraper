But the process can be long (my PhD took five years). The first couple of years may be coursework-based (depending on the university and the subject), and then you take exams before progressing to research. If you flunk out at this point, they award you a Masters.\n\nAt least for Princeton maths, there was no coursework, and you took your exam (https://web.math.princeton.edu/generals/) at the end of your first year.",

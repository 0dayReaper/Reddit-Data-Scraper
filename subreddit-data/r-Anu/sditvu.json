    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nThis is my first post on reddit so yayyyy!! Anyway, I've got an offer the Bachelor of engineering (R&amp;D)(honours) course for this year and was just seeking some advice on the following questions;\n\n1. Is it a versatile degree (i.e. if a R&amp;D career doesn't work out after graduation, can you go into mainstream engineering with this degree qualification?)\n\n2. Is it difficult to find work with this degree after graduation due to its' niche study?\n\n3. Is the cost of studying at ANU and living in Canberra much more expensive than at Sydney?\n\n3. (Opinion based) Is it better to study this R&amp;D engineering degree at ANU or a double degree of a Bachelor of engineering (honours) and Bachelor of Medical Science degree at the University of Sydney?\n\nAny answers are really appreciated. Have a good day!",

            "comment": "Hi! I was really considering doing the R&amp;D program at ANU but I ended up changing my preference and taking a different program. Here\u2019s the reasoning for my choice. I did a little more research, and ANU doesn\u2019t seem to be a good place to study engineering. The reason is that they don\u2019t really give you an opportunity to specialise: you will graduate with a degree in systems engineering. So to answer your first question, I would say it\u2019s a versatile degree since ANU has a well rounded teaching approach, but I think it would be difficult to go into mainstream engineering because of the lack of specialisation. I get the impression that systems engineering isn\u2019t the most employable. With R&amp;D especially I think it\u2019s rather risky. In my case, I decided to do a different program all together and drop the engineering idea since I wanted to stay in Canberra. I think you\u2019re much better off studying engineering at Sydney uni, where you\u2019ll be given the opportunity to specialise. You can choose electrical, mechanical, civil etc\u2026 And those courses are really good. Chances are you\u2019ll find great employment. In my case, I decided to go into the data analytics to hopefully become a data engineer. You may want to look into it. Of course these are all my subjective opinions, I may be wrong. I hope this was helpful for you in some way, best of luck :)",

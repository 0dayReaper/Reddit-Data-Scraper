(My course: Master in International Relations)\nI am asking as I recently heard that apparently only bachelor's students can do it. \nI am not sure it's true because the website doesn't indicate anything like that.\nIt would be really helpful if anyone can address this doubt. \nThank you!",

Current student here :) I strongly recommend contacting the ANU Global Programs themselves to follow up on this ([https://www.anu.edu.au/students/careers-opportunities/global-programs/understanding-overseas-study/get-in-touch-with-global](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/careers-opportunities/global-programs/understanding-overseas-study/get-in-touch-with-global) ).  I contacted them before applying (for an appointment) for exchange and they were very helpful! Hope this helps.",

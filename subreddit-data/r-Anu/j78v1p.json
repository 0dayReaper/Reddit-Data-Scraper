How easy is it to get a part-time or casual job? \n2. Any pathways from ANU to a more reputable American university?\n3. Are you guys really Australian? ( how hard do you guys party)",

Most people I know got their jobs through friends that already worked there etc. \n\n2. I\u2019m from New York, our system doesn\u2019t play nice with theirs. You\u2019ll have a very hard time transferring your credits. \n\n3. Not entirely, we\u2019re about 30% international students by total enrollment.\n\n3b. Yes. If you want to party it\u2019s not hard to find one.",

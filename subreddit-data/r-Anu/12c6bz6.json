    "postText": "Hi all, I've received an offer letter from ANU for a Master coursework program.\n\nHowever, the offer letter didn't specify when the official announcement of the Chancellor's Scholarship offers will be made. I understand that the selection process can be complex, but I was wondering if anyone has any insight into when we can expect to hear about the final decisions?\n\nI have read the condition for award and it states that the offer shall be released in the first week of the month. However, I've seen post in this subreddit that mentions the offer release can take as long as two weeks.\n\nAny information or advice on when we can expect the announcement to be made would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nEDIT: I have received the scholarship offer 3 days after the academic offer.

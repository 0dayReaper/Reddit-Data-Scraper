Have to pay my own rent and whatnot so I have obviously applied for the cheapest accommodation. Secondly, what happens in the event that I get offered a place like Johns where the rent is mind blowing? Can I beg to change it? \nLastly, my offer for accommodation comes on Jan 2nd according to the accommodation page, should I be worried about everyone seemingly already having their place through conditional offers? So many questions sorry but please help a worried first year out! Thanks :)))",

            "comment": "Welcome to the broken system that is the ANU accommodation system...\n\n1. I have not seen any solid statistics on how many people get their first preference, but anecdotally, a lot of people did not get their first preference for accommodation. For example, B&amp;G - which was my first preference, but I ended up in Fenner instead - would only have roughly 200 or 250 beds available for new residents each year (out of about 520). You can imagine a lot more than 200-250 people will apply for B&amp;G as their first preference, since it is on-campus, self-catered and dirt cheap for undergraduates compared to every other accommodation option in the ANU system, so a lot of people will not get their first preference. I've also heard of people in previous years who preferenced Bruce and were offered Fenner, another person preferenced an ANU UniLodge and was offered a UC UniLodge...\n2. If you do not receive your first preference and are unhappy with your accommodation offer, you can reject it, but it is likely you'll go on a waiting list if you still want to try and get into your first preference. You should contact Accommodation Services in this case to discuss other accommodation options, as not everyone will accept their accommodation offer (but I'm not sure how helpful begging will be). For example, Fenner last year or the year before had a handful of spare beds, since a lot of people rejected accommodation offers with them and the waiting list had been exhausted.\n3. I'm fairly sure no one would have received an accommodation offer before January 2, as some people (e.g. people who did the International Baccalaureate) have not have received their final results yet, which would affect who would receive an offer. The conditional offer process should be separate from any accommodation offers.",

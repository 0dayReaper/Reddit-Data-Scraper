    "postText": "I'm currently in NSW but thinking of making the move to Canberra. I'm hoping to apply for a PhD in the next two years and try for a scholarship. (Long story short my PhD plans got f--d over by the pandemic, so I'm deciding to wait and plan appropriately.) Are there any international students here who can give me insight into the process? :) thanks in advance!",

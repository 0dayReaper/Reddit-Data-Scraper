However if you are going to pay for it through work, off campus is tons cheaper. I started in sem 1 2021 living off campus, and my rent is only about $150 a week per person (living in a 2bed unit with a room mate), whereas on campus is minimum $220, and you\u2019ll be sharing many facilities. I\u2019ve found almost everyone loves on living on-campus though, and especially with coronavirus it\u2019s a bit harder to make friends when you don\u2019t live on-campus. \n\nOne thing to consider is off campus gives you a lot more adult freedom, easier to own a car etc, whereas on campus is a little more guided with SRs, but has more organised events",

I have mates that went to Fenner and they can\u2019t recommend it enough, buildings the in heart of the campus and good culture. BNG also has super good culture but their building is kinda old.",

            "comment": "Hey OP, I used to live at self-catered colleges at ANU for a while. These are my personal views, in general I recommend going to live on Campus for your first year of ANU. You'll meet lots of people and can engage in lots of social activities within the college/outside of class hours. I would not discount UniLodge, because it is close to the city and is self catered and has its own bathroom. In all honesty there'll be plenty of events run by the University wide Students Association and the student societies belonging to your degree discipline, so there's not too big a deal of which college you go to. You'll understand a lot more when you come here! Hope this helps! :)",

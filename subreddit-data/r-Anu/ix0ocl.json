Not so much anymore! \n\nThe ANU subreddit has been given a coat of paint and a few new pictures, as well as a new mod! Me!\n\nHowever, we can't have a successful community without moderators. If you want to moderate this subreddit please message the subreddit or me with a quick bio about you (year of study, what degree, etc) and why you would like to be mod. \n\nAlso feel free to message me or the subreddit with any improvements or any icons that you think would be nice. \n\nOtherwise get your friends involved on here, or if you have Discord join the unofficial ANU Students Discord too:  [https://discord.gg/GwtFCap](https://discord.gg/GwtFCap)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~calmelb",

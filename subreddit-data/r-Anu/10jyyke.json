I would really like to take an exchange program to Japan sometime during my time at ANU. Coming from high school most of the terminology they used on ther website was kind of confusing and I was wondering who I should contact to enquire about this stuff. I would rather sort this stuff out in person as I have had past issues with ANU when using just emails. Would there be any sort of help at the upcoming orientation week? Thanks guys :)",

    "postText": "I\u2019m in Y12 and looking at coming to ANU next year and living on campus. I was wondering which college/hall would be the best for me, I really want a party-heavy, sports, easy going orientated accommodation thats easy to make friends in. Preferably one thats large and diverse as i really want a setting with a big variety of people. I\u2019m more inclined for catered accommodation but i don\u2019t really have a preference.",

            "comment": "All halls participate in inter hall sports so that shouldn\u2019t be an issue anywhere. I\u2019ve heard that johns and wamburun have quite a bit of partying, but really you\u2019ll find the partying type and non-partying type everywhere, it\u2019s not like there is some neat segregation of that between halls. While I believe yukeembruk has the most beds, they\u2019re divided between separate towers with their own cooking facilities so there is less opportunity for intermingling, whereas catered accommodation kind of forces socialisation during the set meal times and other self catered halls usually have one massive kitchen area that everyone uses. All halls will have some level of diversity as the system that allocates accommodation tries to ensure diversity of gender, degree, home town, school, etc in each hall. Although you will see trends depending on the price of the accommodation and facilities (e.g. Wright and Bruce people are more likely to have an element of parental support/wealth/come from a private school [obviously not everyone but the higher price kind of makes it this way] whereas cheaper places might have a higher percentage of students that are solely responsible for their own finances).\n\nHonestly just think about what price you are willing to pay, what facilities are important to you, and potentially location. Wherever you go it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll be able to find your kind of people.",

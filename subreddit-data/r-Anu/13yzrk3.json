    "postText": "Hey, looking to attend ANU in 2024 (currently in Year 12).\n\nI put Wright on my early entry application a few weeks ago, but I had heard good things about multiple of the halls. I am unsure whether I would prefer self-catered/catered (which is why I mostly selected Wright). Looking for a hall that is social but not necessary full of cliquey/mean people. I'm extroverted but enjoy different activities like music (saxophone) and travel and I'm not looking for a super sporty residence per-say. Cost is not a constraint for me but given all this, which hall may I be more inclined to?\n\nThank you for helping me out!\n\nEdit: also, do you usually get the hall you apply for? Most of the people from my grade who've applied to ANU are applying to Bruce or Burgmann, so would that make me more likely to get a spot at Wright?",

            "comment": "Bruce and Wright are very similar, it\u2019s really just about which catering option will fit your needs best. Despite the food not always being the best, I\u2019m very glad to be at a catered place, it saves so much time. \n\nRegardless of where you go, there will be people into all kinds of things, with all sorts of personalities, but halls as opposed to uni lodges will generally be better for socialising. \n\nThe automatic allocation system for halls apparently tries to generate diversity by not allocating too many people from the same school to one hall so I guess it\u2019s good if you\u2019re the only one from your school that applied. Just be aware that Wright is one of the most applied to places so you may not get it and have to do a change of preference later. (Which it\u2019s possible to get an offer to W, even if you missed it in the first round.)",

            "comment": "I think most colleges are pretty similar. \n\nI would go for catered college - its more expensive but makes like so much easier. \n\nI spent 18 months at Burgmann and really enjoyed my time there - but I am sure that I would have enjoyed my time at the other colleges as well. \n\nIt's all a bit of a lucky pick what college you will get into - One college (I can't remember which one now) didn't accept me due to the degree I was studying (Forestry) - as Forestry students had a bad reputation for partying.",

            "comment": "Hey! I live in main wing bruce so I can\u2019t say much about the rooms in Packard but packard wing is able to participate in a lot of main wing events and so it\u2019s still pretty easy to socialize, but there\u2019s no requirement to attend any of the events. It also isn\u2019t a strictly postgrad wing so you\u2019ll run into some later year undergrads as well.\n\nAs for noise level- they can get loud but the overwhelming majority of the time it\u2019s pretty quiet over at packard. The issue arises when main wing brucies host parties because the noise carries over the quad. It gets loud mainly on Thursdays, Fridays or Saturdays just because it\u2019s people having pres and will be gone from the building by at latest 11pm (the noise curfew is at 10pm). It\u2019s definitely not the biggest issue, I find as long as it\u2019s not someone near you being loud it\u2019s pretty easy to ignore. \n\nI hope this helps and good luck in your search!",

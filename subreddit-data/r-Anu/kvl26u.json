Not only do I miss out on attending campus and actually feeling like a student, which I love. But the process of actually working and studying from home literally destroys my well-being. \n\nDoes anybody else feel like this?",

Unfortunately it is out of your hands and the uni\u2019s. If you have concerns about well-being, I\u2019d suggest getting in touch with the uni to see what things they can offer you as I am sure there are many things that are being organised to make this process a little easier to deal with.",

So for me, who has a 4.0 GPA after busting my ass in previous semesters, now gets the same grades as idiots that barely got Cs before.\n\nNot to mention the fact that the act of going to school, participating in class, working in the lab, talking with students and professors actually made my life enjoyable and gave me a reason to wake up in the morning. That's all gone now. Instead, I sit alone in my apartment and watch slideshows while a disembodied voice reads off the points. \n\nIt's hell. It really is hell.",

            "comment": "Obviously I don't know your circumstances, but my general take is that it isn't worth paying full price for online-only courses. \n\nUnis can't afford to discount courses that aren't being offered in person, but they should because they're an inferior product. The ANU is expensive compared to an online degree because the standard of in-person education at the ANU is very high. On the other hand the standard of online education at the ANU is poor. ANU's online courses can't compete with the best online courses (EdX...). \n\nYou are getting ripped off and you seem to recognise that, I think most students do. If you're not in a rush to graduate you can defer and come back when the ANU is offering the courses you paid for again. Working for a year (or just half a year) is not a bad idea financially if you think you can walk into a decent job. \n\nOTOH there are lots of reasons why deferring could potentially not be the best option for you. You'll be more employable after graduating than you are now, so trading a year of work post-degree for a year of work without a degree might not be a good idea (there are exceptions though). If deferring isn't right for you then you just have to suck it up, you're being asked to overpay massively for inferior versions of your courses but that's still better for you than the alternative. COVID has been a pretty tough deal for lots of people, it could be worse!",

Like being charged a gum fee or another subscription fee for a service you can't use. No other business would be allowed to get away with it but the ANU does.",

If that's the extent of your struggles then god help you when you enter the real world... and it's that lack of perspective and adaptability that remains one of the biggest gripes people have re: graduates in the workplace.",

    "postText": "\nYr12 student in the ACT. Predicted ATAR is 86-96. Seems well from that but I\u2019m having quite the crisis about what to do with my life.\n\nMy elective subjects are history, maths applications (the lowest tertiary maths, no calculus), art and a politics \u201ch\u201d course outside of school hours. I\u2019m really regretting my subject choices. I thought I was going to go into politics but now I\u2019m having an identity crisis and am considering STEM, since I like having a job and want to prove to myself that I\u2019m smart. Problem is I haven\u2019t done a science subject and haven\u2019t done calculus. The science I like the most is biology, unfortunately the easiest and least profitable science. I really don\u2019t like maths and have no coding experience so popular choices like data science or computer science are off the table. I\u2019ve also had a lot of mental health issues which have interrupted my studies and made studying and deciding what to do hard.\n\nMy options are as follows\n\n1. Follow my heart and do politics at uni, either a bachelor of polsci or a bachelor of arts. \n\n2. Challenge myself and do science at uni, I\u2019d have to find a bridging course and even then its biology so I\u2019m not guaranteed a job. If I went to ANU like I want to it would probably be a major of \u201cEvolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology\u201d\n\n3. Do a double degree in arts/science majoring in politics and biology, keeping both options open but more debt and longer.\n\n4. Take a gap year until I figure out my mental health so I\u2019m less insecure and can make a better decision.\n\n\nSo thats essentially my dilemma. I\u2019m really good at humanities but I feel dumb and now maybe want to do stem, with the science I enjoy the most being biology (I\u2019ve always loved animals)\n\n\nWhat do you think?",

You'll have a job for life, decent pay and conditions.\n\nDo the science course you don't want, spend the next decade or so of your life doing further and further study, working for peanuts and dealing with the stress of insecure funding and toxic lab environments that work you to the bone. Get sick of it, then go get a policy role in the APS. You'll have a job for life, decent pay and conditions, but you'll be starting a decade behind the rest of your peers. In other words, don't do science unless you have a passion for it.",

The APS had a great program called career starter (or HR school leavers) which you can join 1-2 years out of year 12! after 6 months of probation you will also be eligible for study leave and study assistance payments to go toward your uni! plus a very decent paying job and chance for quick promotion.",

While these motivations are understandable, you are not setting yourself up to be successful in the field. Typically STEM subjects require you to be passionate and interested for you to maintain the demanding work ethic required to do well. I suggest you take a gap year, save up some money and figure out where you want to be and what you want to be doing in the next few years. \n\nAnother thing: if you enjoy science but don\u2019t like maths you\u2019re going to have a steep learning curve at university. I know it\u2019s cliche but it\u2019s worth repeating: maths is the language of science. No matter which STEM field you end up in, you\u2019re going to be using lots of maths. Admittedly biology requires much less maths than most other STEM fields but don\u2019t assume it will be insubstantial.\n\nGood luck \ud83d\udc4d",

What you do in year 12 largely doesn't matter for uni! in my experience most first year courses are aimed at a lower level than you'd expect, and cover all the basics necessary without having to have done the courses in college",

It\u2019s walking distance to Civic (the CBD) so you don\u2019t need it for that either. \n\nIve only really used public transport to go to Canberra Raiders games, but it seems to work pretty well. Long story short, I\u2019ve never needed a car, but I haven\u2019t exactly travelled around Canberra much",

Honestly I've been outside of Australia for most of my life (lived in Canada since I was a kid) so I'm not sure what to expect of ANU or Canberra in general. The only thing I know is Perisher is semi-close for skiing?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in the med program. It feels separate to the main campus, being tucked away in a corner. One day a week is spent at a hospital during the first two years, and the whole of years 3 and 4 are spent at hospitals in Canberra and rural NSW. \n\nCampus life will probably be quite fun for you, a large proportion of students, med students included, live on campus (burgmann, Lena karmel lodge and laurus wing). Canberra is quite liveable with a car or a bike, but is actually a small city and personally being from Sydney does feel a bit small town at times. But in general it\u2019s pretty liberal and there\u2019s a lot of fun activities to do in nature. Plus if you\u2019re craving some diversity, Sydney is just a $30 bus ticket away.\n\nCulturally, Canada and Australia aren\u2019t that different. Don\u2019t expect too much from our slopes, they\u2019re probably nothing compared to Canada\u2019s. Do think about if you actually want to practice in Australia afterwards, I hear it\u2019s not super easy for foreign grads to get medical training positions in Canada.\n\nFeel free to PM or reply if you want specifics on anything in particular.",

I really enjoyed campus life at uni in Canada so that's a nice plus, especially for meeting people. I should clarify I'm and Australian citizen and I'm moving back to Australia anyways, so assuming everything worked out I'd be practicing in Australia, I've got no plans to match back in Canada. I'll PM some more questions.",

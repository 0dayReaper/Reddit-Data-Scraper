    "postText": "This is a premeditated cry for help. I\u2019m a first year, currently staying at Yukeembruk. Next year my girlfriend is moving down to Canberra and we\u2019re planning on moving in somewhere together. From talking to a bunch of people I\u2019ve realised only first years are guaranteed accomodation so I\u2019m a bit iffy on whether or not I can even assume I\u2019ll get a place to stay again. \n\nAlso, my girlfriend isn\u2019t planning on studying at ANU, so I\u2019m kinda guessing we couldn\u2019t stay on campus (or could we just get an ensuite and see if it works). I\u2019m not really sure what the rules are around having people living with you, but I know at YKB they don\u2019t seem that serious about policing it, people come and go all the time, I\u2019m just not sure if someone could stay permanently. \n\nForgetting that, where could we stay realistically for a fair amount of money. Utilities and internet stuff included would be a huge, huge bonus, which is kinda why anu accomodation appeals rn. My girlfriend will be bringing her car down too if that changes our chances.\n\nI know this is really early, I just wanna get ahead on this stuff, I\u2019ve heard a couple horror stories of people stuck with no where to go. \n\nComing from kinda small town near Brisbane, I don\u2019t rlly have any clue about either renting or Canberra so truly any advice would be amazing.\nThank you",

            "comment": "I can't help you with any of the on campus questions but in terms of living off campus you're going to need to work out what your budget is, noting that unless you get room in a share house you will need to purchase your own internet, and utilities. If that budget isn't particularly large you'll probably need to find an apartment away from a town centre, so good thing you will have a car. Then keep in mind that finding a place is both alot of work and can take alot of time as it is a competitive market and unfortunately two university students are not prime rental candidates.",

            "comment": "When you say she's not planning to study at ANU, does that mean she will be studying at another uni or not studying at all?\n\nIf its the first one, you could look into Y Suites - it's in the city, currently under construction, and offers student accommodation. It is not part of ANU, and students at any uni or CIT can apply to live there. https://canberra.ysuites.co/?gclid=CjwKCAjwrpOiBhBVEiwA_473dK_2azAFMqzZgBP9o11oRT6PC3AFRKFDkoCf7hUhbOXmR2JUUUDe_xoCD1YQAvD_BwE\n\nIf it's the second one, you are likely to be thrown into the hell that is renting in Canberra in January. It's the busiest month of the year as not only do the uni students arrive, but the APS graduates come to town to start their placements and Defence relocations happen. Demand will be high, and you should be prepared to compromise on pretty much anything including where the place is and whether it is a room in a group house instead of your own place. There's not really a lot you can do beforehand, except possibly be ahead of the game - there may be more rental stock in December, for example, if you are in a position to secure something then instead of waiting for next year.",

She is planning on studying, just hasn\u2019t decided where yet, or if online or in person. \nWe\u2019ve had a little look at Y suites, just weren\u2019t sure if it was as cheap as we could get. Sounds like we\u2019ll probably want to get this sorted before the January hell though. We\u2019ll be scrambling to figure everything out before then.",

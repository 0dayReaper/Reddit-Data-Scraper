No, but it may help you.\n\n\n&gt; if I have a below average grade but still passing all my courses will it be a problem for bachelors of it?\n\nYou need to fulfill all the requirements listed here: https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/bit\n\nHere is the grading scale at ANU: https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/grading-scale\n\n50%+ is a pass which will mean the course will count as units.\n\n&gt; do employers look at grades?\n\nAt least for your first job or internships, yes they will ask for a copy of your transcript.\nUsually yes, at least for your first graduate job.",

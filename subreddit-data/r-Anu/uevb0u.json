    "postText": "Hi, I recently got my acceptance letter and did not know about the deposit that we apparently have to pay (I currently go to uni in Europe and that's not something we do here). It doesn't say much about it in the letter, and I haven't gotten a response about it from the uni yet. \n\nSo my question is: is this deposit a one time payment meant to kinda cover my entire post graduate or is it a yearly deposit I have to pay? + when do you get the deposit back? Is it once you graduate? \n\nHelp a confused International student out \ud83d\ude05",

You can pull now.*\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.\n\n*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*",

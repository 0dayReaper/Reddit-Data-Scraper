It can be estimated through the infomation given on the uni webside there are about 4500 beds for undergraduate students. Let's say half of the undergraduate students need accomodation which should be over 5000. It is not likely for us to get into a hall at this point. We have to just wait and see I guess.\n\nMy thought is that even if you are not able to be offer an accommodation at a hall, there are other choices waiting outside (for example, Unilodges) so that you can move in for the first semester and apply for the accommodation of second semester. \n\nActually I think it is quite ridiculous that you have to apply an accommodation before you receive an offer to get a guaranteed one.",

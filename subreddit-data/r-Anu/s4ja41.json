This is the key formal communication pathway.\n\nInformally, there are many group. The main one is called \"ANU Schmidtposting\" on Facebook, and is where most student discussion happens ([https://www.facebook.com/groups/168771733252125](https://www.facebook.com/groups/168771733252125)). There's also an ANU Discord, and many FB groups depending on your degree, or if you live off or on campus. \n\nThat would be a great starting point. Hope this helps  :)",

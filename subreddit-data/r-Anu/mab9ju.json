It isn't widely recognised by employers (even within academia) but no one cares what your degree was called. It isn't mistaken for a philosophy degree. Amongst other things it's an opportunity to try post-graduate research during your undergrad degree. It's intended for students who want to do research and it's a very good option for them. As for the peer group,you get to go on a camp, make friends and feel superior to the rest of your cohort.",

I really want to do medical research in the future but this program is only offered in chem, physics and maths majors. Do you know if its possible to do my PhD on medical research and major in chem for my bachelors?",

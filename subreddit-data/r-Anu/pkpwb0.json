            "comment": "Internet in res halls are fairly stable. I use the word fairly as sometimes they can be put under a lot of stress (especially during covid when everyone is in their rooms doing lectures etc). Normally, the internet has good speeds to do anything from streaming movies to online games. Keep in mind some colleges have ethernet ports in their rooms which is quite beneficial, and others are just on wifi",

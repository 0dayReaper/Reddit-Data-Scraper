    "postText": "Hi,\nI am wanting to apply to the Bachelor of Philosophy in science to start study in Semester 1 2024. I have a few questions about the degree and the application process:\n- If you haven\u2019t done any science competitions/extracurriculars/programs outside of school, does this mean you have a far less chance of getting in even if everything else in your application is up to standard (ATAR, references, answers to supplementary questions)? I\u2019m applying through UAC as a domestic student since I\u2019m not eligible for early entry, if that changes anything.\n- Does the program allow you to be quite flexible while you figure out what subjects you are most interested/want to major in?\n- Is it worth pursuing this degree compared to a Bachelor of Science or Advanced Science?\n- If you\u2019re not 100% sure if you want to pursue further research after finishing the degree, does the PhB still offer you pathways into other jobs?\n\nThanks so much, any replies are much appreciated.",

Pretty much as long as your ATAR is high enough you\u2019ll likely get in as there isn\u2019t a cap to the amount of people that can accept.\n\n2) Yeah, the main benefit of the PhB is the flexibility, I know people taking a wide variety of courses and also some people who are just taking specific courses like purely maths and physics. You can also skip some courses as PhB - I know a guy who is doing Analysis and Quantum in the first semester so plenty of flexibility.\n\n3) If you are interested in research you may as well go with PhB, you get some nice benefits with course exemptions if you want and also get access to an academic mentor which is a bit overhyped but it\u2019s nice having an academic contact you can ask questions about research etc. You can always transfer out if you don\u2019t like it.\n\n4) Even if you aren\u2019t sure about research, it\u2019s probably still a decent idea. You will have to do at least 3 research projects in undergrad along with honours but if you find it\u2019s not your thing you can transfer. \n\nHope that helps.",

You get a nice headstart and preference for a lot of cool opportunities, and the grade average isnt toooo hard to maintain. Also you don't need any sort of majors/minors apart from those required for honours. I've done a load of random courses with like no academic consequences. Also there's a great community! I met a lot of my friends through PhB",

I've applied to do the ANU extension course in mathematics and I'll be taking the entrance exam in a couple of weeks.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone knows first or second-hand:\n\n* How well it scales?\n* What the style/form the entrance exam takes?\n* The workload?\n\nThanks!",

The mathematics required would have probably been about year 8 or 9, but there were some good problem solving type things: it wasn't easy.\n* The proof-based questions were also just simple logic puzzles like [this one](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-16-100-doors/).\n\nThe test takes 90 minutes.\n\nBest of luck.",

            "comment": "Here again, a few months later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far the workload has been very soft. We have exercise sets every week but we're allowed to do them during the lesson so if you read the material before you can get them all done early and have little to no homework (bar next week's prereading).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far the exercises have been much more difficult than the problems in the quizzes but still manageable. Our first assignment also has some nice problems but again we have heaps of time and they're not bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost topics are proof-based which you (like me) will probably enjoy if you're someone choosing to take this course but some weeks (applications of modular arithmetic or the fibbanaci sequence, for example) are quite computation heavy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost lectures involve the teacher proving important facts about the topics (some of which are quite long and take upwards of 45 minutes to explain) and if there is leftover time the instructor will walk through some of the problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT October:**\n\nI think the last update was still over zoom during covid 19, but we've been back for some time now (we were one of the first courses to be allowed back).\n\nThe content is still not exceedingly difficult, but I have seen many students score poorly and many others (perhaps even 1/3 of the class) have dropped out. I would suggest this is because of the workload at their home college more so than the contents' inherent difficulty. (Many students who are very good at mathematics at their home college struggle with the nature of the material, since unlike the slow and steady development of the topics we learn at school \\[consider that you do algebra for several years before you are generally deemed ready for a quadratic equation\\], this content is entirely new and introduced quickly, but still expects the same exemplary understanding that you have of your normal material).\n\nThe first assignment and second assignments have both contained harder material than any other we've had, but they also spanned over the school holiday period so they weren't  that time-constrained. Please remember to maintain academic integrity with these things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first examination was long and the questions on it were far more novel than those on the quizzes. But again, it was not so difficult. We had a guest lecturer on the first topic who was well qualified and entertaining.",

I'm someone who is soon going to do the entrance exam as well, and I'm completely lost on what the exam is going to be like, and what the course is going to be like. I doubt I would've been able to hear about what the ANU extension is like if it wasn't for your Reddit posts. So thank you for clearing some of my worries, and just know that you've helped someone.\n\nAlso, one thing I was wondering is do you know how many people took the entrance exam? Meaning, what would the acceptance rate be like?",

Hmm, the acceptance rate was probably somewhere around 50%, but I imagine it fluctuates a lot from year to year.\n\nI'll just add on that we had a different teacher for year 12 than we did for year 11 who was far far more qualified and a brilliant teacher with a very different teaching style. In general, he made year 12 a lot more fun (and a bit more challenging). So just as an overall comment your experience will definitely be dependent on the teachers that you get. But based on what I've heard they're swapping, so you would get my year 12 teacher when you're in year 11 and vice versa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre you applying for any of the other extensions? I know people who did most of them and could ask them questions if you want. Also, one of my friends actually started out doing two extensions (maths and physics), he dropped the physics after a while cause it was not as interesting but it is proof that they do let people do two if you ask to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck to you.",

Then again, I suppose you would be going against other high achievers to get a place. \n\nI'm also applying for Creative Computing (This is the one I'm by far most interested in), and also to physics (purely as a backup for if I don't get into computing or math). That'd be really awesome if you could get some information on Creative Computing and/or physics, because they've been extremely vague on what it's like. I'm most concerned about what the entrance process to Creative Computing is like.\n\nThank you :)",

Only about 3000 people your age are doing tertiary study in the ACT, which means 2% of the whole ACT cohort did the entrance exam just for maths.\n\nI'm afraid creative computing was only introduced this year, so no one in my grade did it. But perhaps I can ask around for you.\n\nBest of luck with your entrance exams for all 3!",

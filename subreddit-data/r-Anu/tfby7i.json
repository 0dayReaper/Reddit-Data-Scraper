Throw in the odd excursion to the library or crying in the shower for a fun time away from all that action.\n\nIt's a good time. Highly recommend.",

            "comment": "Hey! I did my honours in biology. Some research schools honours have coursework you have to complete while doing your own research. My honours in biology did not so I was able to dedicate the entire duration to developing my research, but if you do have coursework your honours can be very intense and you can end up spending less time doing your own research. because of assignments. Your honours year is likely to be super busy and full on, and often stressful, but it should also be fun and rewarding and you should learn heaps from it. It is the first time you are 100% responsible for your own time management and your own work which is both great (you finally get to research just what you are interested in) and bad (if you don't have good work habits set up). \n\nSome things I would recommend you consider: 1. If you need to support yourself make sure you plan your time very carefully, between coursework, your research and working several hours a week you may find yourself pretty stressed so it is worth thinking about and being aware of ahead of time. 2. What research question do you want to answer? If you go into your honours year with a question and a project in mind (that is achievable in an honours year) you can spend more time researching and less time working out what you want to research. 3. Choose a supervisor first. You are probably going to end up spending a lot of very stressed hours with your supervisor. You want to make sure they are someone you will get on with well and someone who is reliable. Talk to other students who have done a project with the supervisor and make sure they won't ghost you half way through and will read what you send them.",

But I can imagine how easy it could be to lose track of yourself when your studies are so independently driven. Thanks for taking time out of your day to help me, mangrove-holly :)",

            "comment": "Research is quite self-directed. You have a lot more responsibility on what your focus and topics are, and to actually do the work. It means you spend a lot more time planning and organising, and finding something worth researching. You have to be commited and ready for that jump, because it's not like a regular degree. \n\nRegardless of which discipline or area, the process will be the same. The specific degree doesn't change the general research process, just the type of work you're doing. In a science field, it could be something novel and experimental.\n\nAll that said, you have a lot of freedom to explore your interests. It's quite a valuable experience and it's one of the few times that you'll have so much choice in what you do. If that's what you want or you think you're capable then definitely consider it.",

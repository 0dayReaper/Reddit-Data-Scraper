Does ANU allow BARTs students to take on a second major such as data analytics or computer science from a different faculty? I can\u2019t seem to find any info stating so explicitly on their website. \n\nThank you for your help!",

That\u2019s why we have double degrees. \n\nI know some unis in Aus allow breadth electives outside the main college, but that\u2019s not the case at ANU. The BARTs programs and courses page is pretty specific on the majors/minors/specialisations you can do.",

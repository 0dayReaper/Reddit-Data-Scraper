There is no contradiction. 0.999... is a whole number.  \nBut of course you'll ignore this, just like you always do, because you know you're wrong, but you can't admit it, so instead you'll just repost these flawed \"proofs\" in another subreddit or comment thread and hope no one notices.  \nGo on great Magister",

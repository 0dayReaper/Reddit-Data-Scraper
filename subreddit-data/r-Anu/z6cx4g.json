    "postText": "Hi guys! I am an exchange student who will be studying at ANU shortly. I was just wondering what a typical weekly course schedule looks like? At my home university it is not uncommon for us to have entire Fridays or afternoons off, and each class only takes around 1.5 hours, twice a week. How is it at ANU?\n\nThanks :-)",

            "comment": "Depends on what you are studying. Typically for each course you need to dedicate 10 hours per week per 6 unit course over the 12 weeks of teaching. For science courses, a higher ratio of those 10 hours per week is dedicated to on campus lessons. For most humanities courses, a lower ratio of those 10 hours per week is dedicated to on campus lessons (typically, 1 x 2 hour lecture and 1 x 1 hour tutorial per teaching week per course, with the remaining 7 hours devoted towards \"independent study\").",

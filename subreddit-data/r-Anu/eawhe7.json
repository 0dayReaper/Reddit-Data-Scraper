            "comment": "Hi there, it depends on what level of study you are undertaking, either postgrad or undergraduate. I'm an undergraduate and I'll simply assume that you're undertaking both as undergraduate degrees. When taken together, the degree timeframe is 5 years, in your first year you'll mostly do mandatory first year courses for both degrees; Foundations of Australian Law, Torts, Contracts, Introduction to International Relations, etc. Most of this information is contained on [programsandcourses.anu.edu.au](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au). \n\nFor an LLB/BIR Degree Program beginning in 2020, this is the program site:  [https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2020/program/ALLB-BIR](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2020/program/ALLB-BIR)",

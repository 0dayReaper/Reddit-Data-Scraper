But I want to living with local students together to experience the Australian culture and try to get involved in Canberra local communities. \n\nI don't know how to do this, how can know about more local students and I am not sure whether they are willing to living with a international student or not.\n\nIf someone can give me some advice or suggestions that's great!\n\nThank you.",

They'd be just like you and open to meeting new people!\n\nOthers have said to look up flatmates.com.au, but id also get into contact with the student union and see if they have any advice. Very often they will have advice regarding renting/insurance costs/dealing with landlords etc, as well as a noticeboard of people looking for flatmates, or people leaving rentals and seeing if someone can take their lease.",

I would contact student services - they should be able to help you.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m currently applying to study undergrad at ANU for next year and I\u2019ve been thinking about doing a double degree. I\u2019ve always been set on doing International Relations but I understand that it\u2019s a very common degree and paring it with another degree would help a lot with job prospects, etc. \n\nCan anyone who\u2019s currently doing or has completed a double degree tell me about the workload? I\u2019d rather stick to just one if it\u2019s going to entirely drain my social life (as I\u2019ll have to work as well). \n\nAlso what are some good degrees to pair with it if I do decide to go down this path? I would do polsci but I\u2019ve heard that it overlaps a lot. \n\nAnd lastly, how would I apply for a double degree through direct apply? I\u2019ve already filled out the application, but I couldn\u2019t figure out how to choose preferences for a double degree not just a single. \n\nThank you for the help!!",

I can only speak for how my first 7 weeks have gone but I have never felt as if I have needed to sacrifice meaningful social experiences just to get work done.",

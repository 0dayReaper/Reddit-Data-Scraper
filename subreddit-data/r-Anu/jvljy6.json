Notoriously the worst food on campus.\n\nWamburun apparently goes hard. Also self-catered.\n\nBurton and Garran is very mixed, also has a fashion sense distinctly belonging to the 80s or 90s. Also self-catered.\n\nWright has culture?? Gonna be very much a party hall next year as it only has a 15% returner rate, Halls usually want about 50-65% returner rate.\n\nBruce practices secret hazing, seems pretty alright though.\n\nFenner is just more of the same as Wright, though self-catered.\n\nUniLodge, one word: prohibition. Lots of people transfer out after a semester or two or try to. Wouldn't recommend if you want to be social and not just live in your textbooks.",

The buildings for Wright/Bruce are modern and vibey. There is a cozy rooftop area on Wright (possibly Bruce too?) for parties and social gatherings, a study room (every two floors, I think) which seemed convenient, and a great dining hall (which you can tour in 3D along with the rest of the halls' facilities on their respective pages which can be found [here](https://www.anu.edu.au/study/accommodation/student-residences)). Also, the toilets are amazing, and seemed spotless when I visited.\n\nIn terms of social life, I hear that it's good from the people I know who stay there, but since it's a brand new hall, you'll be a part of shaping the culture there. They definitely seem to be hosting a fair few events (both within Wright and inter-hall) to ensure people have opportunities to find new friends.\n\nIn terms of flexi-cater, apparently its quite a lot better than full catered because the days where you wake up too late for breakfast or when you just want to order dinner because you don't want what they're making, you're fine to do so, and not missing out on a paid meal. You're given 16 catered meals per week rather than 21 so you could skip breakfast every weekday, or eat a meal out a few times a week and still get all your money's worth. So it really depends on how often you feel you will want to eat catered meals.\n\nDM me if you have other questions but I don't know how much I'll be able to answer. You can also check out the [Wright Hall website](https://wrighthallmedia.wixsite.com/website/faq).",

Will look into it.\n\nI've been at Wright all year excluding quarantine, agree with all of this. Especially re the building/facilities being fantastic.\n\nThe onus is definitely on you to make friends/engage with the hall, but you definitely get out what you put in. Also, a ton of residents (including myself) weren't accepted to return to Wright next year, so I think the hall will still feel very new next year.",

I\u2019m moving into Graduate House next year which is a bit cheaper ($280ish pw) but is for postgrads only.",

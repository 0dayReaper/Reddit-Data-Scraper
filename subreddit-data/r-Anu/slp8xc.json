    "postText": "Hi guys! I\u2019m a first year in uni doing the Bachelor of Economics and I got a bit confused while trying to enrol cause I don\u2019t know if there a distinction between enrolling in classes for the first semester, autumn session, winter session, and the other categories underneath. \n\nLike I\u2019m not sure if the the autumn session and the winter session are sub-categories of the first semester, or if I have to just enrol to different classes underneath that. \n\nIf anyone could explain that would be so super helpful!!",

    "postText": "Is anyone finding that most of the buildings on campus are super hot and stuffy? particularly the law school but also Chifley? \n\nIt is particularly uncomfortable to study or be in class. It feels as if  the air is super still and muggy, yet hotter than the outside temperatures.I suspect it may have something to do with the ACT Government's insistence of ensuring all public buildings are energy efficient at the cost of human comfort. AC exists right?",

I started in 2016 and experienced Union Court, had the pop-up in 2017, went on exchange in 2018 and came back to Kambri last year and the difference is astounding. Union Court was bustling, felt like a uni, and had a great vibe, the pop-up was decent, more modern but kept some soul, but Kambri... Fuck Kambri, it's so bougey it's not funny",

Never got to see UC and haven't found any videos or anything specifically showing it off, but Kambri doesn't seem *that* terrible (only been to ANU once for a short visit), so is it just bad in comparison UC? Has the social vibe changed a lot as well, as a result of the change of space? Also, if anyone has a video of Union Court that would be cool to see!",

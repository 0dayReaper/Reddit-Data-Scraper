            "comment": "Quality of teaching in ANU's CS department is quite variable, some lecturers excellent, some not. But exactly the same goes for UNSW.\n\nJob prospects - both ANU and UNSW are good institutions, UNSW people have more connections at some employers, ANU people are well connected with a lot of good employers too...\n\nUNSW has the better reputation for CS, but ultimately job prospects depend mostly on whether you personally perform well.\n\nWhy are you looking at a Masters degree? What's your undergraduate background? What do you hope to get out of it? Do you have a desire to be in Canberra? What kind of work are you looking for?",

So I decided to take a Master's degree (with a focus on AI) to fill in the skills I lack. I choose Canberra because my cousins are already there.",

If you're filling in skills that you didn't study as an undergraduate, this is fine.\n\nI should also add that UNSW definitely has a larger variety of courses, but of course there will only be a certain number of courses that you will want to do depending on your background and interests.\n\nI imagine having family connections will be helpful to your success when you're studying in an unfamiliar country, so that may well be a more important factor for you!",

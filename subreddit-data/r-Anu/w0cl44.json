(Two medium size universities in a town of 400k)\n\nIf you\u2019re intending to work in the private sector it might be better to go to Sydney or Melbourne, even Brisbane and go to the sandstone university in that city USyd, Melbourne or UQ - there are more/bigger offices of big4 and Banks, there are more random companies who might employ an economics grad as an \u201canalyst\u201d\n\nIt sort of depends if you are intending to do undergrad and just get a job or if you\u2019re wanting to do a PhD and become an academic economist or something In between \n\nIf it\u2019s just getting bachelor/honours and getting a job IMO ANU and Canberra is a bad choice for someone from overseas because the private sector job opportunities aren\u2019t there.",

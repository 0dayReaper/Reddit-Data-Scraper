    "postText": "Hi all,\nI have received offer for Bachelor of commerce and bachelor of law at ANU for feb 2023. I was wondering if choosing Kinloch is too far from Law building. Also what is the price for 3 way share room coz the site is showing 1 bedroom apartment for $ 305. Help me with this.( I am an international student)",

            "comment": "Congratulations on the offer! ex-Kinloch ressie here. Graduated a few years ago. Kinloch is a 2 minute walk to CBE, you\u2019ll appreciate being so close to the building as a biz student I think. Kinloch isn\u2019t really that far from the Law building. I\u2019ve definitely had to walk by the law building to get to some of my classes and have also gone there multiple times to use the law library study space as a student. I walk everywhere though in CBR so it just depends on how far is \u2018too far\u2019 for you. To me, anything that is a 15-20min walk away is nearby. The thing that I loved the most about Kinloch (all lodges apply to this) was the proximity to the city. Supermarkets like Coles &amp; Aldi is a 10min walk away. Main complaints I\u2019ve heard from my friends who lived in residential colleges at ANU was how far the supermarket was, especially if your hall/college is self-catered. You\u2019ll hear many comments about \u201cLodge culture\u201d, particularly about how it can be difficult to make friends in Lodge (i.e. lack of events, social nights etc.) Personally none of that mattered to me as I enjoyed being able to go home and not be expected to socialise.\n\nFor price of rent though, do check the unilodge website for the 3-share. Email kinloch if they offer NRAS for share rooms just to check. An NRAS studio might be more worth the money than a 3-share. Do your research, know what you\u2019re getting into and you\u2019ll be fine :)",

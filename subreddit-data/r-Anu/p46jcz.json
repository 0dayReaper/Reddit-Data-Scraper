    "postText": "hi, i\u2019m currently in year 11 but researching unis and hoping to go to ANU. i\u2019m autistic (+ adhd, depression, anxiety, all the things lol) and was wondering about the culture/attitude of lecturers + students? are people/the university itself accepting + accomodating of disabled people? is it difficult to get accomodations and are they actually helpful? i\u2019m currently not in mainstream school so i\u2019m mostly worried about the transition from being very supported + understood to possibly not being,,, (i\u2019m looking at doing history/literature/gender studies if that makes a difference) thanks :)",

            "comment": "Hey there! I don't have much to add to these responses but here's my thoughts (views are my own). I cannot recommend Access and Inclusion (A&amp;I) enough. I had a physical injury that impacted my study and I contacted them. Usually you ask a health professional/GP to fill out a brief document about how your lifestyle and study are impacted. Then you meet with a staff from A&amp;I who help you out. I know some people who've had extra support during tutorials and lecturers (eg notes were taken for them, rest time etc) and special considerations for exams. Overall in my experience ANU and ANU Disability Student Association were really helpful and supportive. I suggest you look at this page (https://www.anu.edu.au/students/health-safety-wellbeing/access-inclusion) and even give A&amp;I a call, I'm sure they'd love to talk! Hope this helps :)",

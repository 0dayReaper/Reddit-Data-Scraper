    "postText": "Hello! I'm an international student planning to enroll at an Australian Uni (ANU is one of my top choices) for my undergraduate studies for the upcoming Feb 2022 intake. I would LOVE to get some advice from students pursuing bachelor of finance in regards to social life, workload, internships(especially for international students), and anything else y'all have to share :)\n\nAlso, I have received 40/45 in my IB examinations( somewhat close to a 98 ATAR) and would like to know if I have a shot at receiving a scholarship for my course!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks alllll",

I would think this would be equivalent to 44 in IB or 3 A*'s for those doing A-Levels",

I'd say definitely be open and joining societies like AFEC will help you immensely with finding similar minded people doing the same courses as you. We also have international students societies if you want to meet people from the same country as you :)\n\nThat being said, I'd say finance is one of the easier degrees here for sure in the earlier years, as most of it is simply learning formulas and applying it. Third year comes through with way more interesting and real-world courses but obviously are significantly harder. Make sure you don't slack off in first year(like me) and as long as you have good work ethic, you should be able get a good gpa.\n\nAlso, if you wish, I recommend doubling up your degree as you open up so many more options if you choose something related like computer science, data science, maths etc. \n\nFinally, work experience helps a ton with securing graduate jobs, which may be difficult due to your visa. However, internships/work are crucial in nailing those job interviews later. This is where joining a society's committee would be good, as it helps you acquire the same experiences you get in a job environment.\n\nGood luck! Hope you enjoy it here.",

I\u2019m asking because as a VCE student, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth going to Canberra to do a finance or commerce degree when I can stay somewhat local",

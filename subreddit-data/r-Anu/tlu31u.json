    "postText": "Hi, I am currently planning to study in ANU. Therefore I was looking for the possible degrees that I could choose for my future career. I am hoping to work as a cybersecurity specialist and I'm wondering the difference between the cybersecurity major in the Bachelor of IT versus Bachelor of advanced computing. I know that the duration of studying is different, but I'm not so sure what kind of difference exists if there is a same major but in different bachelor's degree.",

            "comment": "Differences in courses are typically few but Bachelor of Advanced Computing is generally more technical and computer science heavy whereas IT will have more of a management focus. For your purposes it sounds like IT is the go especially considering it\u2019s a shorter program",

            "comment": "Im about to graduate IT with major in cyber. If I'm honest the cyber major is pretty useless, I dont feel like I have learnt much that will be useful in my career (thankfully employers dont expect you to either). \n\nIn terms of IT or adv comp, they're essentially the same for the first year and half. I thought adv comp had to do 1130 and 1140 (extension versions of 1100 and 1110) but looking at programs and courses I dont think thats the case. If you're a strong coder than you could get through adv comp, but if you have never coded before I would definitely recommend the IT program. I believe they got rid of SE degree at ANU, so adv comp is the degree that people wanting to be a SE do.",

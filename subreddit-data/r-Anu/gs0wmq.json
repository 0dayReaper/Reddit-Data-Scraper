    "postText": "Hi Guys\n\nI am thinking of applying to ANU in 2021 for Science or Science/Law, depending on if a manage to get the marks for Law. I'd be coming from Sydney. \n\nHowever, I can't find much about the accomodation online. I definitely want a catered , so would anyone be able to tell me a bit about the four catered colleges?\n\nWhat is the culture like/are they inclusive/what is the food like? Is it easy to make friends in college and do people make friends outside of college?\n\nThanks everybody.",

            "comment": "Culture - the bigger the better. There's something for everyone. The colleges have various sports/arts events and compete against eachother, in addition all colleges have Residents Association whom organise events and parties. Generally you keep to your own college, but you also make friends through uni courses.\n\nFood - was \"ok\" when i was there. If you're fussy or have dietry requirements, i generally advise against catered. i'm yet to hear of anyone dying of starvation.\n\nfriends - easy. you're in a college of several hundred students, there would be several hundred in either direction. Imo its easier to make friends at a catered college as you're forced to eat together at a standard time. not suggesting self catered is isolating, just people can cook at different times.\n\nI stayed at several colleges when i was there, and had friends at all of the others. All the colleges along daley are generally the same, with minor differences. Generally the population size makes the biggest difference.",

            "comment": "I'm at Burg currently. There is a great culture around everything in the college from parties to sports matches to the formal dinners. Everyone is very inclusive which is nice and if you are a nice person it is very easy to make close friends (people even refer to their floors as second families. The food is average but there is always the option for pizza (weekdays only)/wraps/toasted sandwichs for lunch. For me, I have a large group of friends from Burg and about 10 people I would call friends from my course. Also, burg has a large number of science and law students who usually will be happy to help you with your uni work.\n\nI would recommend trying to come and visit the colleges (if they allow it with covid restrictions) and get a feel from them yourself.\n\nHope this helps",

    "postText": "i came to uni really really excited, cause i love learning and have generally done well at school, academically and socially. but honestly so far uni has just been a drag; content is dry, assessment is badly structured, accurate and clear communication is a whole 'nother level of non-existent.\n\nalso, i'm working pretty much full time to afford life, which, combined with study, is getting kind of draining. (unlike what appears to be the rest of anu, mummy and daddy aren't paying for my university experience).\n\nall in all, i am sorely, sorely tempted to just drop out and join the afp or something (i'm ineligible for the adf because of an old injury and genetics, annoyingly).\n\ni guess what i'm asking is, does anyone else feel like this? and what is the likelihood of my life being okay even without a uni degree?",

            "comment": "aww, sorry to hear this. I don't think it's ideal to work full-time while studying, cause it'll be really tiring imo. can't you get a loan to help you pay with your degree? the FEE-Help and the other type of loan? \n\nI did my degree last year (not at ANU) and I was working more than full-time (50+ hours/week) cause I needed to pay for everything myself and It was dreadful, and I ended up didn't really experience uni entirely.  \n\nI think if you're living in Australia, you'll do fine without a degree. You can get some entry level jobs like admin/data entry or retail and work your way through it to be a manager, it's pretty easy to do that without a degree. \n\nMay I ask what do you study? and if you could tell me more about why it sucks? cause I'm planning to go to ANU next year to do a double degree (Science and psychology or music)",

Now, I'm doing part time uni and I want to change my degree, because I am not willing to drop out. I'd recommend a few things..\n\n1. Part time study is seriously god-tier. You have a lot more time and really there isn't a sacrifice (at least not for me). I don't mind doing a 6 year undergrad degree, and it allows you to get into a large variety of jobs that may actually interest you that you wouldn't be able to do if you were full time, I bring examples of ADF Reserves, AFP (as they are very flexible), and more. Also, you will probably do even better at school grade wise and you'll have more time dedicated to other activities. Genuinely, part time is amazing. Oh, and, part time study will allow you to do some great resume building.\n2. If you do drop out, make sure you know what you're doing and make sure you know you can do it. If you are absolutely not able to enlist into the Defence Force, I can't imagine the AFP is any different (Unless you are applying for specialist or support roles) - also, and you probably have done, but make sure you are actually ineligible for enlistment because there's a lot of things people think about Defence that actually aren't true (if you have any questions about this more, feel free to ask because I have a lot of experience with DFR and the process)\n3. Take next semester off to think about it more. I have changed my mind, way, way, way too much and honestly, it is important to stick with something long enough to make sure you know it's not for you. Or, conversely, try a part time job whilst studying part time? (the AFP do have really flexible roles).\n4. You have maybe completely made up your mind already?\n\nEDIT: Part time is cheaper, kind of.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nthe accom changes close today, and I was wondering if the accessible rooms (particularly in Fenner Hall) were intended for only wheelchair users? I have various physical disabilities, but I don't require a wheelchair. I wish to apply for an accessible room but I don't know how many there are, and if I would be taking one away from somebody who needs it more than me.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate:\n\nI just called and in case anybody is in the same position, an accessible room does not cost any more than a standard room, and to put in an application or inquiry, you email [accom@anu.edu.au](mailto:accom@anu.edu.au). Hope this helps someone! (I'm not sure if this changes for any other accommodations)",

Currently there aren\u2019t many residents with physical disabilities staying in the rooms so there will be plenty of availability (usually they go to Senior Residents if not taken)",

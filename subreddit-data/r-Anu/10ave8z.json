I believe you can, like an arts degree, choose what area you want to go into like science, arts, etc.. and progress yourself through the degree by research/development as opposed to simply following and completing coursework.\n\nA little bit is set coursework but I hear you can start researching earlier on in the degree like doing a PhD or research Masters. I think you get put under a supervising professor and conduct experiments or assist with them (not entirely sure). \n\nWhen you graduate, you have a custom description written on your paper because PhB is extremely vague. I believe it outlines what research you did into what area.\n\nThe nature of this degree means you must know you'll be dedicated to your selected craft for the entirety of your degree with passion and autonomy. At least that's what I hear and all my friends who do it have already been into their craft since way back when.",

            "comment": "The whole idea is to be diversified and trained in research so you can do postgrad studies.\nYou have more freedom in the courses you can choose, and don't need to pick a major per se, but still need to be specialised. For example in PhB science they encourage you to take as many courses from different fields as possible and choose to specialise in one or two as you continue your degree.\nBut this isnt mandatory, I've been following the requirements of a specific major like normal since first year.\n\nThe research aspect comes from having to do a certain number of advanced studies courses where you find a supervisor and complete a small research project during the semester. Usually producing a 10 page report by the end.\n\nYou also have to maintain a 75% weighted average in your classes which can be a killer. \n\nYou might hear the stereotype around anu that PhB students are arrogant and pretentious. Tends to be accurate lmao",

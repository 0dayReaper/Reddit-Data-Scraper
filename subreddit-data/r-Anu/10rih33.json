    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am a new transfer to ANU and have had my credit transfers approved with BIOL1003, BIOL1004, BIOL2142, and BIOL2151 marked at EXE (and all the random 1901 and 2901 courses given as STE). On ISIS, it only lists the STE courses not the EXE courses - is this an error? It's preventing me from enrolling as it says I have not met the pre-requisites. \n\nWould appreciate help if anyone else has had this experience after transferring!",

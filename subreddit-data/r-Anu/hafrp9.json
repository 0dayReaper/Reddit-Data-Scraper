    "postText": "Hi all, I'm a faculty member at ANU and stumbled on an earlier [question](https://old.reddit.com/r/Anu/comments/g4fwz2/does_anyone_know_much_about_the_master_of/) about some of the Masters programs (by /u/youonpointphife). I would be happy to try to answer questions you might have, especially about the postgraduate degrees, either here or by PM. I'd like to stress this is not in any official capacity, just trying to be helpful.",

I would like to do a postgraduate in finances (with a strong foundation in programming and maths). The program that caught my attention was the Master in Statistics. I would like to know if is a good option to study this master, and try to give it a financial focus (or application). What do you think?",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am planning to take either course in Semester 1. I looked at the Class Summaries and it seems like STAT1003 focuses more on probability and R while STAT1008 works more with data analysis techniques at least in the first weeks?\n\nSTAT1003\n\n* I am learning R and enjoy working with it.\n* STAT1003 only has exam-based assignments.\n* Has 4 probability classes. I am weak with probability (only know a little of permutations, combinations and some probability involving both) and would like to learn more as long as the lectures are manageable content-wise.\n\nSTAT1008\n\n* On the other hand, STAT1008 has 2 project-based assignments which I like.\n* I am new to most of the content and don't understand much to list any more factors that could affect my decision.\n\nCould you advise which course will be a better fit for me? What is the workload like? What are the assignments like? Are the courses fast-paced? How are the lecturer and the tutors? Tips to do well in classes?",

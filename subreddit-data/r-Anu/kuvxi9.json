    "postText": "Hi all, so I\u2019m a recently graduated high school student and will be starting a BA at ANU this year. My high school has basically taught me nothing about what to expect in uni. I have no idea what uni classes involve and how someone\u2019s supposed to go about independent living as a student. I\u2019m moving from regional Vic so this will already be a big challenge.\n\nNow, for as long as I can remember I have been working part time, saving up my money for uni and acting as frugally as a teenager can. I\u2019ve got 8g saved up, but after I received my offer for accomodation at Kinloch Lodge, I\u2019m starting to doubt I\u2019ll survive my first year. 300 a week? You\u2019re kidding. \n\nI\u2019m not from a wealthy family, and my parents are not in a position to support me despite their annual income surpassing the threshold required for financial support. I have received no scholarships nor am I eligible for any of them. My ATAR wasn\u2019t impressive but it was enough to get me an offer from ANU, my dream school. Centrelink claims that I\u2019m only eligible for 200 a fortnight. Surely that isn\u2019t right. \n\nWhat am I missing? Everyone I have spoken to claims that they get by easily just on Centrelink. But Im starting to think that\u2019s bull. How much does a student, on average, spend a week on essentials? Will my 8g last me the year or will I need to find work quick-smart? HELP. \n\nThanks :)",

            "comment": "It certainly is difficult, but can be done.  Between [Youth Allowance](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/youth-allowance-students-and-australian-apprentices) and [RentAssist](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/rent-assistance) you're looking at about $750 a fortnight til the end of March, then it drops back down to $600 a fortnight.  There's also two one-off relation payments which you may be eligible for since you're moving from Regional Victoria; the Relocation Scholarship and the Tertiary Access Payment.  Each of these is about $5000, though I suspect there's some fine=print which means you can't get both.\n\nWith the $8k you already have, you'd be able to make it to the end of the year.  However, it's probably worth also looking into doing some part-time work.  Even just retail on Sundays would give you a lot of extra wiggle-room.",

I was in a very similar position (could only get ~$500/fortnight from Centrelink) and the Relocation scholarship ($~4700 in the first year) kept my head above water whilst I was looking for work. It's hard as hell, but make sure you put your home as your parent's address and your term address as you Canberra address so you get the money, it's a big help.) Don't be afraid to take the Student start-up loan either, you need the money now (~$1050 a sem)",

            "comment": "$200 a fortnight for Centrelink sounds like the at-home rate of payment. If you\u2019re moving (especially interstate), you will get around 5-600 per fortnight depending on any part time income. COVID may mean you get more (for a little while). \n\nYou may then be eligible for a relocation scholarship, and (if it still exists) an additional loan you can put onto HELP for expenses like textbooks. I\u2019ve found textbooks aren\u2019t too common these days but in my first year textbooks cost nearly $1000 per semester sometimes. \n\nI don\u2019t know how mature and financially literate you are, but I thought I was pretty worldly (had moved out of home prior to uni, had worked since 14 and had had a gap year), but I still blew my entire relocation scholarship on nonsense. It was gone by April of my first semester. In hindsight, I would not have spent it all, or at least spent it on buying more durables for setting up a home and not alcohol. YMMV, and don\u2019t be afraid of making your own mistakes along the way. \n\nI\u2019d recommend a part-time job. I had a great time working in hospitality for most of my uni jobs, and particularly benefitted from places which had lots of staff (for friends but also atmosphere), working hours that can vary over the semester, and free food. I found Canberra fairly easy to get a job, but obviously the word has changed since I came to town. \n\nWith Centrelink, you can work around 10 hours per week without losing any welfare, and the payments decrease by around 50-60 cents on the dollar until the payment goes to zero. If you work too much to receive a Centrelink payment for 6 fortnights in a row, you may have to reapply for Centrelink. Check all this info yourself to make sure it\u2019s still accurate. \n\nI personally found myself working too much and often getting no Centrelink payment and poorer grades, and you\u2019ll have to work out a balance that suits you. \n\nMy suggestions to any first year: attend every lecture and tutorial - it\u2019s not hard and you\u2019ll rarely catch up even if you think you will. Live on campus, but only for a year or two, and then move into a share house (where the rent drops - a lot. I pay less than 180 for a bedroom in a house in the inner north. There are still plenty of houses at around that price.) Get a job to pay the bills and for drinking money, but leave enough time to make friends. Join one or two University societies on Market day(maybe a sport?). Get a job in hospitality at a good restaurant, cafe or bar, but think about what good stepping stone jobs you could work in your third+ years and what steps you need to take over the next two years to get there. \n\nI would try not to spend any of your 8 grand. Use that for holidays, emergencies and trips back home - those kinds of expenses will be hard to save for on a part time income (although you should try to save a bit of every pay check as a good habit). \n\nDon\u2019t get a credit card. I\u2019ve spent the first 4 years of my career paying off massive credit card debt. I don\u2019t regret the expenditure, I had great holidays and good times that I didn\u2019t have the money for without them, but you should try to use your current savings and some advance planning instead.\n\nThis is all pretty general information, but I\u2019m happy to give specifics. I think Canberra and ANU will be a great time for you.",

After this adjustment you should be better able to determine how much time you've got free for work. \n\n*remember to budget for the big ticket items: computers, art supplies,  car rego etc. That's what your savings might be useful for.\n\nIf you want to treat yourself look for deals like cheap ass Tuesdays. \n\nGood luck.",

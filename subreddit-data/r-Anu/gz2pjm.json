    "postText": "Hi! I'm currently deciding whether to accept my offer for the Bachelor of Arts starting this July. I am hoping to double major in either Political Science or International Relations, and Sociology. I haven't found too many student-made YouTube videos or blogs, so I thought I'd make a post here. \n\nI would love to get in touch with anyone that is either currently studying, or has already graduated, from Political Science/IR/Sociology at ANU. I'm an international student, and I'd be starting my classes online, so if any current first year Social Science students want to connect, that would be fantastic. \n\nThese are some of my main questions: \n\n\\- How large are lectures? Do teachers hold office hours? Is there a good amount of support from professors and staff for undergraduate students? \n\n\\- How flexible is the degree? I got the impression from the study plans online that one should finish one major first before using credits on a second major or minor. I am not yet sure if I would like to major in Political Science or International Relations. Is there enough flexibility in the first year to try out different programs and courses? \n\n\\- Is there a sense of community/social life on campus? Would there be any online group chats/facebook groups that I could join to meet people while I'm studying remotely? \n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "The ANU subreddit is always pretty quiet; you may be better off with the relevant facebook page.  That said, I can answer some of your questions:\n\nLectures range sigficantly in size.  Your main first-year courses in Pol Sci and IR will be huge, with hundreds of students.  Many of your latr year courses will be much much smaller, some as little as 20 or so.  Lecturers hold office hours regulalry.  These are typically very poorly attended.  I find that deeply unfortunate, since it's a service you would otherwise have to pay about $100 an hour for, and it's free, and almost no-one uses it.  Support for students will vary by discipline and lecturer.\n\nThere's a fair bit of flexibility if you're just doing a single degree (like a BA).  You do not need to follow the online study plans, they just give one path that will work to complete your degree.  In any case, there is definately enough flexibility to let you choose a major in second year.  In first year you would (typically) choose four subjects, and do one course of each in each semester.  So you would do Pol Sci, IR, Sociology, and 1 other subject in each semester of your first year.\n\nAs most people come to ANU from outside Canberra, if you stay on campus there is a good sense of community within the residential halls.  This varies a bit by hall, with the older colleges having a stronger community, and UniLodge having a weaker community.  Obviously this will not be the case next semester with Covid.",

            "comment": "Hey! I am a 2nd year Political Science/IR student. In terms of accepting your offer, it's probably good to keep in mind that ANU is using 'hybrid learning' in which tutorials may be in person and online, but lectures/workshops will remain online where possible. This means you may only be required on campus for 4 hours a week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn response to your questions:\n\n1. Lectures vary in size. Most 1st year Political Science/IR compulsory lectures are quite large and can range between 300-500 people. However, I have had more specific topics on subjects like Politics in Central Asia or Migration Studies where the lectures are under 40 people.\n2. From what I have heard, the Bachelor of Arts is very flexible. You will be able to try out subjects within these areas, and if you decide not to continue with them you may still be able to keep your units as electives.\n3. There is a great sense of community! ANU Schmidtposting on FB is the main ANU student group, and there are more specific groups and departments for the areas you're studying. I would also recommend joining the ANU student discord ([https://discord.gg/hz3Vt6](https://discord.gg/hz3Vt6)) and liking the ANUSA page on FB to keep up to date with events. \n\nHope this helps, feel free to let me know if you have any more questions.",

Are they discussion-based/do you get a chance to speak? \n\n\\- Is it confirmed that some tutorials will be on-campus? Have you (current students) already received some news about this that hasn't yet been released to new students? \n\nThanks again :)",

Most are based on participation and discussion, so part of your mark (usually around 10%) will be based on attendance and your participation in discussion.\n\nIt has been discussed in correspondence from the uni to current students, online options will still be available for those learning remotely but I\u2019d encourage you to reach out to the uni for some more information on how it will work for your specific degree :)",

            "comment": "It depends a lot on what you mean by 'maths'.  ECON1101 is designed to have very little/almost no 'mathematics' in the high-school sense of the term, but is quite heavy on 'mathematical thinking'.  As u/J0N007 says, there's significant analytic thinking and logical deduction involved at various stages. We also use a lot of graph-based models which could be described as mathematics (but also could not).\n\nSo basically, students who have a solid maths background (say 2-unit maths from NSW) say there's almost no maths in ECON1101, while students with a very thin maths background (say, just scrapped through year 10 maths and hated it and quit as soon as they could) say there's tons of maths.",

    "postText": "i\u2019m an international student commencing my first year at ANU in July. I applied for accommodation after i got an offer (i didnt know that i need to apply before) but anyway when i first applied, pretty sure there are 3 selections for me to choose from: 2022 full year, 2022 semester 2 and off-campus. I chose 2022 full year as i thought it means i will stay for a whole year at the campus until next year as well. Today i decided to check my application status but i can\u2019t see my application anymore. Currently I\u2019m panicking as I may have done something wrong during the application  because i login the portal and can\u2019t view my application at all, let alone the status. It\u2019s like my application disappeared. \n\nanyone can help me with this please! I\u2019m really nervous rn since i may not be able to get a place on campus this july\n\nAlso, when i first applied, I already got an email from ANU accomm saying that my accommodation application is now complete but i CAN\u2019T monitor my status. \n\nWas i supposed to choose 2022 sem 2 instead of 2022 full year? Why can\u2019t I find my application and its status?",

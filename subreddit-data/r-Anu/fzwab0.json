I am especially looking to hear about how the lectures and professors are (organised, unorganised, enthusiastic, etc). Other than that, if there are any things you think I should know about the course, let me know :) Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hi, I finished Advanced Computing R&amp;D recently. \n\nYour question about lectures and professors is too broad - some courses are far more organised than others, some lecturers just read off slides, others are extremely enthusiastic about teaching, etc.\n\nYou should know that R&amp;D is research intensive - you will start doing research in your 2nd year and half your time in your 4th year is dedicated to your honours research project. You need to carefully consider whether this is right for you, as some people love research some others hate it. \n\nIf your objective is solely to become a software engineer, then R&amp;D may not be the best degree for you (although it sets you up well for the future). If you want to go into research and academia, then R&amp;D would definitely help you a lot - you would be able to publish papers, go to research conferences, etc. \n\nAlso final note don't just do R&amp;D because it has a high entry requirement, as others have done...",

All I know is that many view CS at ANU as being very theoretical, which I think I would enjoy. Could you give me some examples of research projects that have been undertaken by students in the degree in the past (or direct me to a site with listings)?\n\nIs the Bachelor of Advanced Computing essentially R&amp;D without the research component? Would this still be less suited to a software engineering career than other degrees at other universities?\n\nLastly, could you elaborate a little on the \"although it sets you up well for the future\" bit?\n\nSorry for all the questions...",

Keep the location of the uni you choose in mind as that is very important as well.\n\nHere are some example student research projects: http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/CSPROJECTS/current_past_projects.html\n\nAnd a list of general projects: https://cecs.anu.edu.au/research/research-projects\n\nR&amp;D students are usually expected to research something more theoretical than practical. You have the flexibility to come up with your own project given you find a suitable supervisor.\n\nYes, in normal Advanced Computing you basically only do some research in your honours (4th) year. In your third year, you work on Techlauncher which is sort of like a group software engineering project instead of research. The intention for this is to give you experience in software engineering, but I think an internship is far more valuable than this.\n\nIn contrast, in R&amp;D your sole focus is research, which I personally found interesting and challenging.\n\nI'm of the opinion that the stuff you learn in undergrad is similar no matter what uni you go to. As a software engineer, you pick up most of the skills through work experience and not classes at uni. \n\nWhat matters more in getting your first internship/job is how the recruiting scene looks like and the connections you make. Obviously that is much more limited in Canberra that say Sydney.\n\nI know lots of R&amp;D alumni who have gone to great tech companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.), PhD programs at top unis worldwide, etc. \n\nNo worries about all the questions. Feel free to ask more - I'm happy to help.",

When you said,\n\n\"I know lots of R&amp;D alumni who have gone to great tech companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.), PhD programs at top unis worldwide, etc.\"\n\nI was wondering if R&amp;D students are at a disadvantage because their degree is focused more on research opposed to industry skills?\n\nAlso, I have heard that R&amp;D has its prestige (probably because of ATAR and GPA requirements) and so, its easier to get a good job after Uni because the employer sees 'research and development'. Is this actually true or do people just say it for the sake of it?\n\nThanks in advance :)",

If you're able to get into R&amp;D and maintain the 80% average requirement, I'd think you'd have the ability to do well in the interviews for these tech companies. \n\nSince ANU is more theoretical you'll be learning the fundamentals, which will probably help you in your career as an engineer in the long term. Doing research also helps you gain a whole lot of other skills such as working independently, learning how to communicate and write your ideas clearly and succinctly, and working under strict deadlines. (You could say normal uni courses do the same but research helps you develop these skills at another level) \n\nAlso, I would say most industry skills are learned on the job rather than at uni. I will say though that it is true other unis offer more practical courses (e.g. UNSW).\n\n&gt; Also, I have heard that R&amp;D has its prestige (probably because of ATAR and GPA requirements) and so, its easier to get a good job after Uni because the employer sees 'research and development'. Is this actually true or do people just say it for the sake of it?\n\nI personally don't think this is true - your average recruiter is not going to really notice the R&amp;D component of your degree unless you explicitly explain what it is. You'll probably have to impress them with other stuff such as your grades, projects, awards, publications, etc. Your past work experience is probably one of the most important things a recruiter is looking for in a grad job.\n\nSomething that is very important is to not focus solely on your courses at uni. Try building some side projects, getting work experience, volunteering in STEM-related activities, participating in extracurriculars, etc. This helps building your profile and also so you don't become crazy from just studying :)\n\nAlso companies really value interpersonal skills. If you're super smart but don't get along with the interviewer/coworkers, then you would likely not get the job",

The uni does offer an internship program (https://cecs.anu.edu.au/engage/computer-science-internship-program) but that's usually for more local companies than tech giants (Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc.) and it counts as coursework.\n\nYou'll need to work on your skills and projects in your own time to build your profile and become a competitive candidate for an internship.\n\n&gt; I'm also an international student so would it even be possible to get internships in Aus?\n\nI'm not very familiar with the process for international students, but it is possible. Unfortunately, being a non-citizen will likely narrow your opportunities. Many of the internship and grad job applications I filled out explicitly asked whether your are a citizen. You could also apply for jobs in your home country if that's easier.\n\nYou should probably ask someone else with more knowledge about this...",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a new student looking at taking a beginner level-language minor in Chinese, in a double degree of laws and IR. Does anyone have any experience with whether it is worth sacrificing the 24 units to it, and how doing only one component (spoken or written) per semester functions? I\u2019m unsure as to what the co-taught designation means - do I have to do both spoken and written simultaneously? If so, wouldn\u2019t this effectively preclude double degree students from the course? Seems unlikely to be the case, but just looking for information.\n\nI\u2019m also interested to hear about how people found the actual learning experience of only doing spoken or written on their own, as coming from learning French, swapping between spoken and written every semester sounds extremely inhibiting to learning the language.",

            "comment": "Im not an international relations student so i cant comment on the worth for you.\nWhat i can say is that spoken and written actually mostly happen at the same time and the courses are typically designed with the other in mind. So its not quite like swapping from spoken to written, as you tend to use both in differing amounts. \nAll in all it makes the experience pretty smooth going through at the same time, but you may notice youre learning different aspects of the same content from semester to semester.",

    "postText": "So I recently got offered early entry for ANU, and got accepted for B&amp;G Hall. Which is great, however I only realised after getting accepted that most B&amp;G rooms have no self contained bathrooms and instead there are only communal bathrooms + showers. What makes this particularly bad for me is I'm a trans woman and I don't think I'd feel particularly safe having morning showers etc. in a communal space. But I thought I'd ask, for anyone that's in B&amp;G how bad are the communal bathrooms? Like are they usually really crowded and rowdy? Also in general, how is your experience there (esp. if you're trans/queer)?\n\nThanks",

They\u2019re a tight knit group and some of my closest mates came from B&amp;G. In regards to communal showers - I haven\u2019t been in one in B&amp;G specifically but overall in my college, there was never any issues that made me feel unsafe or unwelcome.",

Other than that, above covered everything but feel free to get on the B&amp;G page on the ANU to see the 3D tours yourself. Compared to other bathrooms I've been in, it feels much safer and trust me when I say that people feel just awkward as you when you see them in there:)",

            "comment": "Hi! I know this is a super late response, but thought it might be reassuring if you're still thinking of living at B&amp;G. I'm also a trans girl and I've actually had a really nice experience with the shared bathrooms. They are all gender neutral, which has honestly made me feel safer than the vast majority of public bathrooms since I feel less worried about people being discriminatory. Everything is in cubicles, so you have complete privacy. Also, people aren't really rowdy or obnoxious and noise complaints are taken care of very quickly. Just in general, B&amp;G is a really welcoming space for LGBTIQA+ students and I've definitely never been made to feel unsafe there.",

It won't be crowded, everyone has a different timetable and lifestyle so chances are you will be the only person (or two) in the bathroom at a particular time.\n\nSpace can be limited tho, takes a few days to adapt like what to bring with you into the shower, etc. A bag or basket might come in handy for those shower stuff.",

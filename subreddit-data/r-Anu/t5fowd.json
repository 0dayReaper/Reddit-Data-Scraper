    "postText": "Hi everyone, does anyone here use any sort of academic article summarising service/software? Do you have any recommendations or insight about their effectiveness? Other than that what study hacks do you use to save on study time? I'm considering alternatives to simply reading every required reading weekly, since even through skimming it takes way, way too much time and the retention is not very good.\n\nCheers!",

I know some people call this the [Rubber Duck Technique](https://london.ac.uk/news-and-opinion/student-blog/need-help-studying-teach-a-rubber-duck).\n\nFor me, what works is pretending to 'teach' the lecture once I'd watch it/take notes, and want to see where I feel confident I understand and where I don't.\n\nBonus points if you pick a classroom and 'teach' an empty room! :D",

The course convenor usually provides all the necessary reading papers, videos etc. \nThey are both easy courses, I wouldn't do them if they weren't mandatory. \nYou will be fine if your report writing skills are decent.  I would concentrate on the other courses.",

            "comment": "I took this course in 2019 during my masters and also skipped pp1 (i did a mcomp advanced). For me the course was a complete waste of time and easily the most useless course I've ever taken. The content is more or less a meme and the delivery was done in a flipped classroom format where 99% of the class didn't bother doing any reading as they would all rather be doing another course actually useful to their degree. When I did it, it was mostly group based so make sure you get a good group. The course is not super difficult to pass but is a gpa dropper for top students as HD marking is highly subjective. I knew several people who changed degrees (from mcomp to mmlcv) after pp1 just to avoid this course.",

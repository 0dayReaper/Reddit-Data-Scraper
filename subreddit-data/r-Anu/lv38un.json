    "postText": "I enjoy track and field, (meaning running events e.g. 100m, 400m and also field, e.g. javelin, discus) and I was curious as to whether ANU has any of such events/clubs for me to participate in. I looked at the ANU Sport website, but it only mentions the sports such as badminton, soccer, even quidditch. \n\nThanks in advance!",

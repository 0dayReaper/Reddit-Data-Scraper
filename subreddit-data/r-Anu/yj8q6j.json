Can i do this after i have accepted my offer? Do i have to wait until next year? I really don't know - my parents never went to uni. Any help is appreciated!!",

            "comment": "I totally recommend doing a double degree. It does not increase your semester workload at all- same amount of courses completed each semester/year as a single degree. It only adds an extra year, which is not that much in the scheme of things and if you\u2019re a good student you can always make it even shorter. I\u2019ve managed to put my 4 year double degree to only 3.5 years by doing some summer and winter courses which have been really enjoyable!! It also gives you extra room for the other major and maybe a minor which could really help with job prospects later (much broader field you can enter) and for me I\u2019ve really enjoyed doing totally different courses rather than all similar ones- it\u2019s less draining.\n\nOther poster is right- you can add honours later, but it isn\u2019t for everyone (not for me) and can be pretty intense.\n\nAlso regarding changing it. I haven\u2019t changed it before but it\u2019s not too difficult. You could do it after semester 1 (just apply for a degree transfer, pretty easy to do) or potentially apply for offer rounds through UAC for a flexible double degree?",

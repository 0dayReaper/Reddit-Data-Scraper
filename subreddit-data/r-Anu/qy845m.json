I received the Australian National Scholarship but I barely know any of the details. If anyone else also got this scholarship please pm me!!",

You can find information on more scholarships here: \n\n[https://www.anu.edu.au/study/scholarships/find-a-scholarship](https://www.anu.edu.au/study/scholarships/find-a-scholarship)\n\nSome require you to send an application to ANU, and some are administered externally. Take your time and explore around for a bit.",

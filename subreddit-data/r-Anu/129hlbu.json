    "postText": "Hey guys, I am a year 12 student looking to study at ANU next year and I am finalising my direct application. The last thing I have to pick is accommodation. I really like the huge desks at B&amp;G and it is cheap, but an issue I have is that I am 6'5 so I don't fit in single beds, which is what I have heard B&amp;G has. So is Wamburun the only hall with either a king single or double (I would prefer a KS since I would have to sleep diagonally in a double)? I am only looking at self-catered halls as I like to prepare my own food, and everyone says the lodges are terrible for socialising. Wamburun looks fantastic as well because it is modern, I am just wondering if that is my only option?",

B&amp;G may be different since it\u2019s older, but they should be king singles?)\n\nWamburun is the only undegrad hall with a double. I\u2019ve been in both situations, and whilst I do like the double, it takes up a lot of your floor space. Wambam would probably be your best bet if your 6\u20195, but I know people taller than that who\u2019ve survived in King Singles (the other 4 lodges have king singles).",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm 6\"3, I was at Wamburun last year and BnG this year. Wamba has King Single beds for corner rooms (which I was in). Corner rooms are noticeably smaller than the rooms everyone else gets, they can also be in annoying locations  For example my room was about as far from the kitchen and elevator as possible which was just inconvenient. Wamburun also has incredibly short showers, you will have to stoop the whole time which is uncomfortable and inconvenient. Otherwise, the Wamba facilities look new but are usually cheap/low quality. Happy to talk about it much more if you DM me. I still think Wamba is a great place, it had a huge international community (65%+ of the hall) and also allowed postgrads which was super cool. It was a great place if you're sociable and like meeting people from different backgrounds. \n\nBnG has significantly better facilities from what I've seen so far. The showers are better but the beds are Single-XL (same length as king single but same width as single). BnG has better music facilities and recreation stuff in general imo. But yeah TLDR wamba is a super fun place, facilities are bad for tall people",

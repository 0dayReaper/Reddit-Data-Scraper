    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am an international applicant who received an offer for the master of statistics for semester 1, 2023, and I would like to know how is the program in terms of workload and if you think ANU is worth it? (spending two years for a master's degree at ANU). It would be helpful if I could get some reviews or feedback on this program from current or former students. I am seriously considering going to ANU, and this is gonna be life-changing for me so I hope I won't regret my decision.\n\nAlso, is anyone from Hong Kong planning to go to ANU next year?\n\nThank you!",

I think intensive coursework probably won't be a problem If the school has enough academic support for eager students.\n\nand yeah thanks for the advice about the accommodation too! I did a bit of online search about it but still have a hard time with the preference. Will look more into that:D",

    "postText": "Hi hello! :D\n\nI'm in an international student in my final semester of Bachelors at the moment from all the way in Perth, UWA. I really like life in WA, but the restructuring debacle and huge cuts to social sciences/anthropology at UWA is seriously making me reconsider pursuing a Masters of IR/Public Policy here. \n\nIn saying that though, I understand that this is a trend across universities and that ANU sees cuts as well. \n\nI guess my questions are what's the student/campus life like in Canberra, how is postgrad at ANU (does it live up to its reputation, specifically for politics/law/public policy?), would it be \"easier\" to get a job afterwards, and any other advice that'd help me make up my mind.\n\nCheers!",

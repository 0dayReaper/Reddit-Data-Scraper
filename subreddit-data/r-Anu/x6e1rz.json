I just received an offer to study at the ANU this morning for a double degree in INSS and IR (At least i\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what I put down, it says flexible double and I can\u2019t find specific degrees but am 95% certain that\u2019s it). \nThis might just be me stressing a bit but I was wondering if the offer was unconditional? I know I still need to get an ATAR but didn\u2019t know what else. Can I just accept the offer and be all good?\nCongratulations to everyone !",

ANU will honour these for study in 2023 as long as you complete Year 12 and receive an ATAR",

    "postText": "Hi there! I\u2019m a prospective student for the July intake and wondering if I should apply for on-campus accommodation or find my own rental. \n\nI have chronic insomnia and am sensitive to noises. Could you share whether the rooms at lodges/halls/colleges are reasonably sound proof so that you can\u2019t really hear your neighbours partying or fooling around?\n\nThank you for your help! Cheers.",

            "comment": "Lodge is pretty soundproof through the walls but sound definitely goes through your door. I guess it would largely depend on if your neighbours have their door open / you live near the elevator. However, there is always an SR you can call if it gets too bad as the rules state that noise should be kept down after 10pm",

You may get lucky and they give you a room they hope might work.\n\nMy big tip(s) apart from that: tell them DETAIL- example some people sleep like a baby with roads noise but one human voice outside their door will set them off, another can't stand loud aircon,  another finds hearing the lift mechanical systems working hard, another hates nature noise. Nature noise is relevant because whole of campus is one big bushland, a few km x km, there is a nature reserve on two sides, and there are very loud galas in some parts of campus.\n\nSame thing with light. Some people love a quiet dark cold room, some people need a room with sunlight in the morning to keep their circadian rhythms stable. All the new halls (the uni lodges closer to civic) have heavy artificial light all around the outside so if you don't like artificial, probably LED light seeping in your windows, you will have to cover your window in silver foil.\n\nBeing specific about temperature and what does and doesn't work is again a thing.\n\nLastly about noise coming in through your door, it would probably be possible to add a layer of sound proofing to the inside of your door as long as removing it doesn't leave any marks.",

                            "comment": "My other two ideas:\n\nAAA:\n\nAbout temperature, noise, light, dust and smell, also doors that rattle: in almost every house I ever lived in, I put a line of draft exclusion seal around the edge of the bedroom door frame (door frame not the door), in a way that would create a strong seal stoppping airflow, light, sound, dust smell and temperature moving in or out. An example, not the only one, is this: &lt;[https://www.bunnings.com.au/moroday-grey-econo-weather-seal-tape\\_p4061864](https://www.bunnings.com.au/moroday-grey-econo-weather-seal-tape_p4061864)\\&gt;\n\nI'm also not recommending Bunnings, you don't even have to buy from bunnings I recon you could buy in other shops too.\n\nI was going to explain where the tape goes but writing it was taking too long.\n\nLandlords never objected and I never had to remove the tape when I left. However if you do have to remove the tape you just do research about what solvent will remove it then start on one end of the tape, brush or spray the solvent that will dissolve the adhesive on to the edge where the tape and door frame are still together then pull a bit more up, put on more solvent, pull a bit more up repeat etc.\n\nBBB:\n\nAbout temperature, a thing about colleges (and sometimes hight rise) if you haven't experienced them before) is heat leaks out of one apartment/room into another. Say you are in an apartment with a neighbor in every single direction, both sides and top and bottom, then any one of those neighbors may just run their heating day and night at very high levels and you may never have to run yours or even may be uncomfortably warm. This epecially happens in places like college where no-one is directly paying for the energy to heat their rooms, and, there are a lot of people who aren't adjusted to Canberra temperatures yet.",

            "comment": "bng rooms vary slightly since the hall is so old, I got lucky and my room was incredibly soundproof with regards to hearing my next door neighbour (literally never heard him and he was very loud)\n\nwith the window closed i could cut out most of the noise from the courtyard/common block (i was top floor facing inwards) - with the exception of the cockatoos in the morning, they are horrible, and there is no escaping them anywhere on daley road (i thought i was used to loud birds in the morning since my parents live near an escarpment, i was wrong, this shit is another level). that being said, i would keep my window open during the day since i got all the noise from the music rooms and it was actually very nice to have in the background.\n\ni had friends who had less soundproof rooms, but even then theyd only ever complain about people having loud sex or people screaming at their computers, so like- relatively extreme levels of noise, you dont have to worry about hearing others peoples day-to-day movements in their rooms (actually, the one exception to this is people closing doors, *some* rooms have ridiculously heavy doors and they are very loud)\n\nhowever, no matter which room you have you'll be able to hear everything going on in the hallways, luckily people dont spend much time there, but you can hear everyones footsteps and conversations. since i was top floor, this wasn't a big deal for me, but now that i think about it i could see it being annoying for people who live on the bottom floor near the entrance\n\nthe hallway thing is true for just about everywhere tho",

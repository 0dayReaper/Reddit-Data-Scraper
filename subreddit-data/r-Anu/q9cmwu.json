I couldn\u2019t gauge their \u2018vibes\u2019 by visiting in person so if someone can share their experiences/advice would be great:)\n\nThe other thing is that I\u2019ve realised burgmann requires personal statement so just wondering what to include if I were to apply for it. \n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Hey OP, current ANU student here who used to live at college. My advice is to first see what type of accommodation you want first (eg Catered/Non catered, living solo/with other people). Both Bruce and Burg are catered but Burg also has self-catered rooms with their own bathrooms. In terms of options, regardless of what you choose, you have the option of transferring between residences (link: https://www.anu.edu.au/study/accommodation/accommodation-application-advice/applying-to-transfer-to-a-different-residence ). You would have a much better idea of vibes once you come here. I'd also recommend going on the College Facebook pages and asking your perspective from current students there. Hope you have a great time in college life! :)",

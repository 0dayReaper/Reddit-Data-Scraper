    "postText": "Hello, I accepted my offer two days ago and I am very excited to begin my studies at ANU in semester 1, 2022. Just wondering, does ANU send any emails after they confirm my enrollment by sending the COE? Any welcome emails/ zoom meets/ anything  at all? Do they give the student email when the course begins? I want to know what to expect from them until I reach campus for O-Week. \n\nAlso, I'm interested in a couple of clubs. Would it be fine to participate in their activities now that I am enrolled to the uni?",

You are welcome to jump onto many of the Facebook groups, discord servers, etc and start meeting people and seeing what's up. New@ANU 2022 and Schmidt posting on Facebook are a good place to start, plus the ANU students discord. Also check out the ESA or CSSA since you're in CECS by the looks of it. Beyond that, just sit tight and enjoy the spare time \ud83d\ude09",

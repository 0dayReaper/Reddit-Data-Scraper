Every class I try says I haven't completed the requisites, I'm studying a double degree in Internation Security Studies and Criminology commencing semester 1 2023 if that helps.\n\nIt says I have to have a flair so I've tagged spoiler.",

You're not able to enrol in certain courses bc you haven't completed the courses you need to before. Also worth checking the \"first year advice\" tab on your degree page to see what courses you should take first. Hope this isn't too confusing!!",

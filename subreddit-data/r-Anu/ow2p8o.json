    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nThere seems to be a group of year 12 students on this subreddit who, like me, are applying for direct entry into\nthe ANU with their year 11 results, and I was wondering if you guys could help answer my question. My\nissue is I keep on checking back on \u2018Track your application\u2019 in the online portal, and under the section listed \n\u2018qualification status\u2019 there is a greyed out box which says \u2018Results not yet available\u2019. The status explanation is kind\nof opaque, it just says that my results aren\u2019t available yet and that the university will obtain them on my behalf\nwhen they become available. I am getting worried because there is only 7 days left until the acceptance/rejections\nfor the August round are released, which is not much time for my results to become available. I contacted the\nfuture student team a few weeks ago and they still haven\u2019t responded to my email.\n\nSo basically what I\u2019m wondering is if I have missed some critical aspect of filling in my application in terms of \nproviding my year 11 grades, or if everyone else also has the \u2018results not yet available\u2019 on their application as well. \nMy understanding was that ANU would contact my school to obtain the results, but I uploaded my semester 2\nyear 11 report just in case. If anyone could provide any information about this I would appreciate it a lot :)",

            "comment": "I think the results they are referring to are your year 12 results which obviously aren't available yet. By saying they will get them on your behalf that is only if you don't get an August offer and you go into the December offers based on your atar. then they will get your atar. You will need to have your year 11 report uploaded under your year 11 qualifications.  \nI don't have the \"results not available\" message but that section on my application is highlighted in grey",

Do i still have to pay for my enrolment before February or can I pay for my enrolment in the later part of the year?",

I vaguely recall having to fill in a form (or click an option) to defer by a year. \n\nBut you won't have to pay anything. Fees are payable based on your enrolment in courses. I think the SSAF fee is also only payable if you are actively enrolled in courses.",

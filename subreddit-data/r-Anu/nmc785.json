    "postText": "Hi, I am a 22 year old female student from the UK who may be coming to Australia this summer for 1 year. My family are in Canberra so I will be living with them. While I am here, I am looking at doing a short course at ANU, mostly so that I can make friends with Australians my own age. \n\nDoes anyone have any information about short courses at the university? I have a first class degree in history from a good UK university and I also have a graduate diploma in law so I would be looking for something in the arts &amp; humanities/ law/ economics faculty.\n\nFurthermore, would I be able to get a good social experience on one of these courses? Although I see studying at ANU as a great opportunity in its own right, a major motivation is being able to meet people. Do you guys think that I would be able to meet people through these courses or would the better social opportunities come through the full courses? \n\nFinally, how would you guys describe the social experience at ANU? \n\nThanks so much!",

            "comment": "Being a humanities student myself, I've found that the longer courses have provided more opportunities for longer courses, especially given that the schools within are quite close, and you get to know the faculty and other students quite well over 3-4 years. The demographic is also generally younger.\n\nI wouldn't imagine the short courses are any less welcoming, but the time pressure and workload may not leave a whole lot of time for socializing. I've done a few units which are generally a part of the shorter courses and the demographics are largely older post graduates.\n\nEDIT: I should add this is from the perspective of a history undergrad. I know what's going on in Law as well, but I have no idea about Economics and the like.",

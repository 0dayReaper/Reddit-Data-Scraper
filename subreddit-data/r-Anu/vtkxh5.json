            "comment": "Behavioural Economics? I did this in 2021 S2 under Simon Grant. Looking at the ANU page, it seems like he is teaching again. I doubt it would change much under someone else, as my friend\u2019s experience with this subject at UC was similar to mine.\r  \n\r  \nTL;DR: The course is great, but fairly maths intensive. Pictures below. I strongly recommend taking it if you\u2019re doing economics as a major or degree, as it provides a necessary critique to regular assumptions.\r  \n\r  \nThere are no listed prerequisites, but I think this gives the wrong impression of the course. If you don\u2019t have at least some understanding of mathematical proofs or some experience with uni-level maths in general, you will struggle. Reasonably simple concepts were explained using very formal mathematics, which I found unnecessary and obfuscating. The mathematics was much heavier than other 2000-level econ courses I have done. I would have preferred they first explained simply and clearly with English, then second talk about the implications and applications, and then finally use mathematics afterwards, but this was not my experience. I struggled linking the maths to any deep understanding of the concept.\r  \n\r  \nThat said, those understandings were highly valuable. To me it seemed like two separate courses smashed together: one psychology, one mathematics. The maths made things difficult, but learning about the psychological stuff (biases, heuristics, observed decision patterns, etc) made the maths very much worth enduring. There is some pretty fascinating stuff that really breaks apart any strong claim of Rational Choice, and throws into question a lot of assumptions made in economics courses.\r  \n\r  \nBehavioural Economics is thus far the only course I have done that genuinely criticised the economic orthodoxy we have been taught. This alone makes it valuable to me, and maybe to you as well. If not, it is still good to understand the limitations and flaws of common assumptions.\r  \n\r  \nAlso, Simon will probably offer a survey before week 1 starts. I recommend participating. Try to remember your answers.\r  \n\r  \n[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/zQ29MTk)\r  \nObviously, these are taken well out of context, but it should give you an idea of the level of maths involved (this is some of the heavier stuff). You\u2019ll be eased into all this, but this is where it leads. As expected from a maths course, do not fall behind. The first slide demonstrates this with its ubiquitous technical terms. The final picture is what we covered in week 2.\r  \n\r  \nI recommend googling what we covered in wk2, or otherwise exploring behavioural economics textbooks to get an idea of what will be taught. Week2 was very psychological, rather than mathematical.",

            "comment": "If simon\u2019s teaching it stay away. My experience was impossible to understand slides, very poorly explained video lectures, but that\u2019s fine as you can always read the textbook as a backup right? The textbook only covered 50% of the lecture material so you were pretty much stuck trying to comprehend what he was talking about in the lectures. First tute Wk1 the tutors were complaining to us that they didn\u2019t understand what Simon was talking about in one of the questions. Top it off with mandatory tutes (you have to go to them to get the solutions) it makes for an unrewarding and extremely frustrating course. I took this course in S2 2021. I hadn\u2019t taken micro 2 either at the time and there was a lot of content that was just micro 2 assumed knowledge especially in wk2. It\u2019s a doable course (it\u2019s not impossible) but it\u2019s just very poorly taught. If you are willing to endure that take it, but if you want to not be frustrated next sem stay away.",

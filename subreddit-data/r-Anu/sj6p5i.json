    "postText": "Hi guys, I\u2018m starting my B of Science (Adv) (hon) on the 21st of Feb. I've already enrolled in the courses Math1013, Phys1101, Chem1101, Biol1003. Now I've just got to work out the timetabling. From what I know, in the abbreviations, LecA/01 and LecB/01 are two different lectures and cover different content.  And then LecA/01 and LecA/02 would be the same lecture, but at different times and sessions. So now I'm confused whether one week's LecA would be covering the same things as another week's LecA. So basically, Are the alphabet identifiers unique for each week? or do they carry over the semester?  \n\nAlso, does the timetabling run in weekly or fortnightly cycles, or do we have to choose which ones to attend every week? \n\nWould really appreciate it if you guys could help!",

If you're curious, here is some of my experience:\n\nMost of the time I would just watch the recordings of mine - however it can be good to go in person, especially to meet your peers. Chem lectures were especially good in person (mark is great). 1013 I found was best for me to watch recorded as often, I needed to pause to catch up.",

I'm the lead developer of [the unofficial timetable](https://timetable.cssa.club), which most people use to plan their timetables.  \n\n\nTimetabling is usually weekly, but that's not guaranteed - public holidays, tutorials starting late/ending early, some events are fortnightly, etc. You're correct that the alphabet identifiers are different content, and the numbers are different times. But a letter+number combo represents unique content, so each week's LecA/01 would have different content.",

    "postText": "I would like to follow some [non-award courses](https://www.anu.edu.au/study/apply/non-award-applications) at ANU. Since I'm not from the Commonwealth I understood that I would have to pay international student fees, but I'm unsure how much that is for a single course.\n\nI found [this document](https://www.anu.edu.au/files/advisory/Schedule%20of%20Tuition%20fees%202022%20V2.pdf).\n\n* What's the difference between UG, PG, and HDR band?\n\n* Once I know the correct band, say 4, does that mean that a 6 units course would have a tuition fee of 6,000$? That seems extreme to me.",

There\u2019s no mistake here, it\u2019s gonna be bloody expensive.",

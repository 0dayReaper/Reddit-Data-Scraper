            "comment": "Hello there,\n\nYou are free to apply to transfer into a double degree for Second Semester 2020. Your ATAR or equivalent will be the only qualification they look at. ANU GPA only becomes the deciding factor after you have completed 48 units (one year of courses).\n\nEven though the transfer may end up being successful that is only the first hurdle that you must overcome. Bach Commerce and Bach PPE do have common, non-elective compulsory courses.\n\nFor example, ECON1101 is part of the Business and Economics Essentials on the Commerce side and is under the 54 of X compulsory list of PPE. As the courses cannot be counted towards both degrees you will need to speak to both CASS and CBE (and likely the convenors of both degrees) on how to proceed. Every stakeholder must agree on the plan of action (no easy task). Perhaps they will let you take another course as substitute for the doubled-up space in the other degree.\n\nFor more general information on ANU admin, please consult my guide, [https://anucipher2020.wordpress.com](https://anucipher2020.wordpress.com) or comment below and I wil try and assist you.",

Bruce was always fun when I went there, same as Burgman, and I heard BnG was pretty fun too. Honestly I think most places you go you can find people who\u2019ll want to go out 2-3 nights a week, and the bars in Canberra are pretty good/cheap compared to syd or melb. House parties also will happen a lot after your college years if you stay friends with most of the residents around you. Obv with COVID nothing is the same Rn, but I have no doubt it\u2019ll return pretty similar in coming years.",

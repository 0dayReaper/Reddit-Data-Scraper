    "postText": "Hello all, I am an undergraduate student taking Bachelors of Economics and I have two questions, one regarding the examinations for ECON1101 and another regarding deferred exams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirstly,\n\nI was just wondering when the ECON1101 mid term exam will be. In the website, it states that it will be held on week 6/7. This is important as it relates to the next question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecondly,\n\nI am a Malaysian Muslim who celebrates Eid al-Fitr and does Ramadan and have planned to head back home on the 31st of March until the 23rd of April for the entirety of easter plus an additional week, 22nd of April being the celebration itself. I have a FINM1001 mid term on the 17th of April and an ECON1101 exam with an unknown date (which may need to be deferred). I was just wondering if having religious and cultural customs which is necessary to do back in Malaysia a valid reason to defer my tests, and what are the chances of it being deferred.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "The best way to resolve this would be to contact the lecturer/convenor about your situation, and ask for a deferred exam. It\u2019s a lot of work to create new exams, but chances are that ECON1101 will already need a deferred exam for sickness etc, and so may not care if another student has to sit that exam. If not, the lecturer may also be willing to just remove the midterm from your final grade calculations (eg so your final exam would be worth an extra 20% or whatever).\n\nYou may want to ask various student support areas for advice before talking to the lecturer, however my recommendation would be reach out to the lecturer early, and reach out to the School/college/student services if they say no. \n\nMy only other observation is that you\u2019re not going to be the only Muslim practicing Sawm or celebrating Eid, and many others will be doing it while attending campus, so what you\u2019re actually asking for is to go on an international holiday during an examination week. You have legitimate reasons for this holiday and for the inconvenient timing, and I don\u2019t think a first year Economics exam should be seen as more important, but it is worth reflecting that the uni may choose not to approve a deferred exam, and it wouldn\u2019t be unjustified. \n\nFortunately you\u2019ve asked with a few weeks before the trip.",

But there are some for certain groups (low SES, women in stem, indigenous etc) that need other requirements - 90/95. Have a look at their scholarship site, it\u2019s pretty good",

I guess what I\u2019m asking is would some kind of scholarship be fairly guaranteed with those marks? My daughter is a citizen but will be completing grade 12 in Canada. Best I can tell her mark could be an ATAR of 99.7 which could put her in the middle of the two ranges you mentioned. Too low for the one scholarship and not necessarily high enough for the other to be guaranteed one.",

            "comment": "From what ive understood they cannot issue a student ID number until you receive and accept an offer from the university since you won't have one at that point in the system. Once you accept an offer, they will gladly provide you with a student ID number. Another option is to wait until mid-June when you receive your matriculation email, which will activate your program and include your UID. During this time, you will also receive an email containing your temporary password to access our systems. Domestic students ANU offer round is the 8th of June so just wait until then! If your an international student though i think offers have started to come out and be released already! Hope that helps\n\nOnce you recieve or ask for a student ID number when you have accepted an enrolment offer, you need to email student accomdation and attatch your student ID number to your accomodation application, only then can you receive an offer!\n\nIm in the same boat as you i think, no need to stress theres nothing you can do until you have an offer!",

I dont believe you need the password yet for accomodation, just make sure you email accomodation services with your student ID number so they can update your accomodation application, other then that you just have to wait for more offeres to be released. If your still confused or worried try emailing them or giving them a call, they're normally quite helpful for this type of situation :p",

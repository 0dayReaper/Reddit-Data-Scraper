I'd like to know what people's thoughts were towards LK and if I should bother with my request to change my preference to Wright or Fenner Hall etc bc I've been told I'll regret being in a lodge over college.\n\nThanks :D",

The rooms are a shoebox and the general build quality is poor.\n\nShe's in Davey now, and whilst a lot older (opened in 2008) and no A/C, the rooms are larger and more comfortable. A/C isn't a big issue due to airflow and well designed ergonomics.\n\nThe halls tend to have more going for them than the lodges but each to their own. Really depends on the effort you put in.",

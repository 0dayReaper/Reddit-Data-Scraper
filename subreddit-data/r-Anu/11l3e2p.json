    "postText": "I\u2019m currently studying a Bachelor of Medical Science but I am thinking of transferring to a double degree program with a Bachelor of Information Technology. By doing so, I would prolong my studies for 1-2 years and waste a couple of units i studied in first year.\n\nHowever, there is also an option to do a Bachelor of Science (majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Biology). This route would only prolong my studies by 1 year and will utilise the units i studied in first year.\n\nIs it worth the extra study to have a named degree? Would employers care if i\u2019ve only majored? (instead of acquiring a whole degree)\n\nThanks",

I was told when I asked the same question before uni that if I did a major in science I would not have the right accreditation from the ACS that you get from doing information technology and that the extra year was worth it for that accreditation. Up to you but they seemed to urge me to do information technology",

            "comment": "What do you want to do after the degree?\n\nIf the answer is money, drop out and do a trade. I suggest becoming a plumber. Get a FIFO gig at some mining site for a few years. Then once you bought a house in the middle of nowhere and sold it for a loss, and spent the rest on beer, come back and finish your degree.\n\nThere's a deep need for research software peeps who understand the domain they're working in. Such people are very rare. Unfortunately, on the whole, Australia doesn't really give a shit about science, so jobs are rare as well and salary isn't competitive with the private sector. That said, the work is really interesting and you'd work with incredibly smart, dedicated people.\n\nTo me, it's more attractive than maintaining some e-commerce site.\n\nThere are corporate biotech gigs of course but I don't have any knowledge of those other than they generally pay well.\n\nEdit: Forgot to actually answer your question.\n\nDepends on what constitutes your major. CompSci is a big field. Many can't really code all that well, and what they've studied is more like theoretical math. Others pick some software engineering courses so it's more like an Engineering/applied math degree.\n\nPersonally, if I were hiring I'd be looking at what courses you did in addition to what kind of experience you have or portfolio you've built for yourself. I wouldn't care so much about what's written on your degree.\n\nSame with IT. If all you're interested in is networks/server/mainframe management then - as suggested by someone else here - accreditation and experience is seen somewhat more valuable, although the degree may be what gets your foot in the door at the start.",

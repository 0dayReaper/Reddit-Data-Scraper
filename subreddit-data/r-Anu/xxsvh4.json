            "comment": "I often see these types of questions from students and prospective students, where they ask for advice on the same program at two different universities.\n\nThe answer is going to very likely be, \"I don't know.\"\n\nYou have to be lucky enough to come across a student that has studied both the same program at different universities (very unlikely), or a staff member which has taught at both universities (or has general knowledge of both), or some recruiter that recruits students from both universities, and would also have some knowledge of each program (unlikely, as they focus on the end product, the student, and leave designing the degree to the university itself). \n\nSo try and develop a series of questions that you can take to students at each university. \n\nAsk:\n\n- what they like\n\n- dislike\n\n- difficulty\n\n- internships/careers help/how focused is the faculty on job placement etc.\n\n- do they regret going there?\n\n- how different semester systems work (i think unsw uses a trimester system, but check this).\n\n- etc.\n\nand then compare what students say. Ask here on reddit, on city subs, on whirlpool, on facebook, try and find comp sci discords, and at open days.",

UNSW students can tell you about their program. \n\nYou are **incredibly** unlikely to find a student who has studied both programs. \n\nSo write down some more direct questions you have about each program and take those to the students directly, and then compare what they say.",

From what I have heard, first-year computer science at ANU is tough. I am not sure though - I have never experienced it. Doing it at UNSW right now and it's hard, yes, but not unmanageably hard.\n\nI did maths at ANU for one sem and that was ridiculously hard. Doesn't seem nearly as hard at other unis from my experience. I wanted to know if its the same deal with comp sci\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks, though. that was helpful",

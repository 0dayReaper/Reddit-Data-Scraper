On the video it just says to put in your Anu ID and then your password but I have no idea what my password could be. I've tried all my normal passwords aswell as the one sent in the email ages ago. Am I missing something obvious? I want to be ready for when the course selections come up tommorow.   \n\n\nI've also send a ticket to the IT support for resetting my password but because it's sunday I assume nobody is working.",

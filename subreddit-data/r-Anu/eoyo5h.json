    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am just about to start at ANU and I was wondering what the workload is like. I am doing an IR/Arts double degree so I have all essays so I am more concerned about how many hours per week you spend studying. I am aiming for a distinction/high distinction average. I run my own online business part-time and I am guessing I will need to work 10-15 hours per week, spread pretty evenly through each day, so I am just wondering what I am looking at in terms of work load. With my courses added up and divided it says about 30 hours per week which obviously will fluctuate, but is this a fair estimate? Let me know",

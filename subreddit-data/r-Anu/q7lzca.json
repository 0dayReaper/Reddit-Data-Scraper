As I have no experience with the community at the accommodations, would it be recommended I change or stick with it?\n\nP.S. I like my privacy and am not really comfortable with a communal bathroom, but also like to make friends and connect with others",

            "comment": "Hey OP! I used to live at Davey Lodge. I had a fun crazy time there, although I was not a fan of no AC. I used to live in a studio (similarly I like to have my own space). My main advice is that if you do not like living there (if you decide to go with Davey) you can apply for transfers to other buildings/rooms ( https://www.anu.edu.au/study/accommodation/accommodation-application-advice/applying-to-transfer-to-a-different-residence ). Also recommend giving UniLodge a call and ask them what your options are if a spare room becomes available. I hope this helps! \r  \nFeel free to PM me for more info :)",

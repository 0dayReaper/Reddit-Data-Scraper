And we have a chance to ask questions to him.\n\n\"The address will give you a unique insight into how a modern-day leader navigates the realities of conflict and war and will give us all a moment to pause and reflect on the importance of upholding and defending the rule of law, democracy and the rules-based international order.\u202f \"",

            "comment": "Hey! I can't comment on IR at ANU but I have been at ANU since my undergrad (post grad now) and I really love it. Canberra is very small compared to Melbourne or Sydney but there are some huge upsides that come from that. You can easily walk to the CBD from ANU, its super easy to get around, there are great restaurants, cafes heaps of activities to do. Getting into nature is super easy, there are three mountains to walk up really close by and rivers to swim in in summer. It's also only a 3hr bus ride to get to Sydney. Student life is a little bit what you make of it! If you join a college it is super easy to access support, events and make friends. There are also heaps of clubs and societies and things at ANU! Feel free to DM me if you have any specific questions about Canberra/student life :)",

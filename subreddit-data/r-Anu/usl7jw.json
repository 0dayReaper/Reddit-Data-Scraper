    "postText": "Hello everyone! I'm a BA Design student from Spain and I'll (hopefully) be studying at ANU by this time next year.\n\nI wanted to know what studying for a Bachelor of Design is like at the ANU. I'll be on exchange for my final year, Semester 1, so just wanted to know what it's like in general: are there any subjects I should look into/stay away from? is the curriculum more research or practice-oriented, or does it depend on the subject? is the teaching quality good overall?\n\nI'd also love to get some insight into making friends at the ANU/Canberra in general. I've seen a lot of people saying Canberra is generally very quiet, which is no problem for me since I'm not really into partying every week and such, but what does matter to me is having a somewhat stable group of friends that I can just vibe with. I guess this question is more geared towards exchange students, but how easy/difficult is making friends at ANU?\n\nThat's all for now, any and all answers are welcome and will be of huge help :-)",

            "comment": "Hey, not an exchange student but given no one else has answered I figured I will share! I really like Canberra. It is not a big city so if you want that \"big city excitement\" then Canberra may not be it for you, but you get all the perks of a big city (food, culture etc) but the peak hour traffic lasts 15 minutes and there is an incredible amount of nature around for walks and other activities that are much harder to do somewhere like Sydney and Melbourne. We also have the museum, art galleries and Parliament House which can be fun to visit. For tourism purposes while you are here it is a very easy bus ride straight to the centre of Sydney. I found it quite easy to make friends at ANU despite being quite a quiet person, particularly if you can get a spot in one of the colleges or join some clubs/get involved in various activities, it automatically puts you in touch with other people. I hope this helps even a little!",

I'm glad it was easy for you to make friends (I'm a quiet person too so that was nice to hear). I'll keep in mind what you said about getting into colleges and clubs. Thanks a lot once again for taking the time :-)",

It's really hard to find any unbiased reviews or gauge what each place is like, what makes them different etc.\n\nI'm currently accepted into Wright Hall, but I'm looking a bit into Burgmann or Bruce as well (obviously subject to availability and getting in) - and I just wanted to know what the actual difference between these would be, which you'd recommend...\n\nThanks so much in advance, any advice is really appreciated!",

My perspective is out of date, they've replaced a few buildings since my time, but I want to reassure you anyway that while there are differences between the colleges your experience will be basically the same at any of them.",

I ran into some John's people at a club before the semester started at the start of this year, and they said they had to sneak out as John's was doing a dry O-week this year (claimed for religious reasons)\n\nOf course they might have been lying or there could have been other motivations for discouraging drinking (culture/safety seems more likely). I was at Wright and didn't know anyone at the private colleges well, so can only really go off what I was told by others",

I\u2019m biased as I lived there my first year but the facilities are brand new (much nicer!) and the flexible catering means you can skip meals without having to pay for them (Bruce does not do this). I will say that Bruce does have a subsidized bar whereas Wright does not, but unless you\u2019re a big drinker you\u2019ll save more in the long run with decreased meal expense. Wright also has (had? maybe not now) a public facing cafe in their dining hall so you can bring your mates in to eat with you during meals, which Bruce will not allow you to do. I got kicked out of Bruce like 17 times my first year, they\u2019re not fond of visitors. \n\nWright culture is still very much in its infancy, it\u2019s a bit of a chameleon and a lot more dependent on the current rescom (student leadership) than what I\u2019ve seen at other halls. This is great if you\u2019re not sure what you\u2019re looking for out of residential life, because Wright isn\u2019t sure either. If you put in a bit of effort, you\u2019ll have a great experience.",

I am think of doing nursing from uni of canberra instead of    B. Health science as nursing has many job opportunities. What are your thoughts about it?",

If you head to the bachelor of health webpage [https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/BHLTH#employment-opportunities](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/BHLTH#employment-opportunities) there is a section on employment opportunities. It is designed as a pathway into postgrad medicine. Unlike nursing which has a specific pathway into being a nurse, the bachelor of health science is more like a science degree where you have to find a career that uses the skills you have learnt (unless you want to go into medicine). You could try having a chat with the career planners at ANU [https://www.anu.edu.au/students/careers-opportunities/careers](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/careers-opportunities/careers) who may be able to help you!",

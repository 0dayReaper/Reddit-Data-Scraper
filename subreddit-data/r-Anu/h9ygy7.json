            "comment": "The system will have changed since, but I remember being involved in the selection of students to an ANU Hall about 10 years ago. Some elements of the selection process will probably remain the same. \n\nWe wanted to balance the intake and these were some of the key considerations:\n- Balance of genders (especially when combined with returning residents)\n- Balance of academic colleges (Eco, Eng, Sci, Music, Art etc). \n- No more than 2 people from the same high school, unless 3 were prime candidates (and we then allocated people from the same school on very different floors). \n- Mix of types of schools (public, private, religious &amp; international)\n- Mix of hometowns (cities, suburbs, country towns &amp; rural)\n- Mix of international country of origin\n- Consideration of extra curricular interests. Someone who played a sport (didn\u2019t matter which one) would be more likely to participate in college sport and casual games around the college grass or common room. Anyone who did drama, chess, art, musicals, played an instrument, debating or other activities is likely to contribute to cultural life around the college and bring their interests to others.\n\nATARs were not part of the application, but some people included it.\n\nThose who included their ATAR in their written application and listed no other activities was a red flag. Would they be someone who could balance their studies while contributing to the life of the college? \n\n(I remember one guy who applied who said he was hopeless at most sports but said he was a keen coach/enthusiastic supporter, and that he was good at video games, snooker and chess. He helped us win both the Chess and Pool Comps the following year; and he was a great girls softball coach, despite never watching a game before!)",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm a unilodge resident and am pretty confused about what documents I need to get to confirm my term address/rent payments on centrelink. I asked reception and they sent me a billing statement but it doesn't have the building address on it, only my room number and home address. Are there separate occupancy agreements for lodges at all? If not, can I edit the ANU occupancy agreement to replace the links to the accommodation portal with my name and address? Is there anyone else I can reach out to for help about this? Thanks!",

Any college should have a template on file they just put in your name and print.\n\nIt will say \"to whom it may concern, xyz is a resident and college from date to date\". \n\nAddress is in the letterhead.\n\nBtw, I think you might have confused them by saying Centrelink. Usually that is about proving the cost of rent.\n\nTry this. \"I'd like to move my driver's licence to ACT, can I please have a proof of residency \" see how you go",

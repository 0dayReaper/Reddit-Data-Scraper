Or in coming to Canberra itself\n\nWhat accomodation is the most,, accepting? And how's the vibes like on campus in general? \n\nSorry if this comes out as kind of rude lmao I just really don't want to get hate crimed cause that shit is scary \ud83d\ude00",

I\u2019m not going to recommend a hall for privacy reasons, but I can tell you that I\u2019ve never heard of someone having a bad experience with discrimination. If it were to happen, it\u2019d be taken very seriously and dealt with.",

I should note in not from a diverse background,  so take that with a grain of salt. \n\nSure,  there are some political fights going on between Australia and 'some nations' but that doesn't transfer down to individuals. \n\nANU is a very progressive and safe place (as is all of Canberra), I hope it you do come here you find it to be a I do.",

Those that would strike someone based on race would probably also strike people regardless, just for coming within 10m of them. You'll be fine, the majority of people aren't racists (atleast not to that extreme) and a some even step in if they saw hate crimes happening :)",

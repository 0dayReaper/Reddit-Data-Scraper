    "postText": "So I got my acceptance a few days back and am really excited about coming to ANU (international student). However I'm really confused as to what accomodation I should choose. The scholarship I'm getting isn't sufficient to cover costs of staying in the institute residential halls but as an incoming foreigner I dont have any idea about rent/living costs outside the campus either. People who've already gone through this, what's the best (cost-effective) way to handle this? \n\nI was thinking of maybe staying on-campus for the first year and then moving out to a cheaper place once I get to know the place a little?",

            "comment": "I\u2019d say on campus and then move off is a good idea, on campus is quite expensive and most people won\u2019t stay there the whole time but it\u2019s a useful tool to understanding Canberra a bit better.\nLiving off campus is a bit harder to negotiate just because you have to deal with rental contracts etc. Whereas you should be guaranteed a spot on campus in your first year.\nCongratulations though and good luck!",

    "postText": "Hello, I've just been accepted into ANU's Bachelor of Science program, and was looking into the majors that they offer (there's quite a few). I was just wondering if there's any particular branch of science that's really at ANU and should take advantage of, and any branches that I would be better off going somewhere else for???\n\nThanks!!",

            "comment": "Hey there! Former ANU Science student and current ANU postgrad (views are my own but obviously biased). I really enjoyed my time by doing as many different types of courses as possible. I ranged from medical science to climate change to policy stuff, which is a key advantages to doing a bachelor of science. The Bachelor of science is really versatile for degree majors/minors. In terms of coursework, for the first few years at least I recommend using your elective for a course that sticks out to you - ANU is particularly strong in climate science (a few of the lecturers are involved in writing THE IPCC reports), geology, and astrophysics (our VC won his Nobel prize in that haha). Personally I recommend doing first year bio or chem as they are usually requirements for a bunch of higher level courses, and utilising the drop in sessions that ANU Science offers (very useful for wrapping your head around various courses/majors/potentially interesting research projects for you). Also strongly consider doing a research project - they're more applied than coursework and you get a lot of mentoring opportunities from the lecturers who are usually very happy to help out. Feel free to PM me if you have questions etc :) !",

Thank you so much for taking the time for replying, your advice was super insightful!\n\nThe reason I chose Science was for the versatility as you mentioned above and I'm glad to hear that you had a lot of freedom within your course, but I'm often told that this broadness means that I need to do a postgrad to increase my employability. If I could ask a follow-up question: do you know how the job prospects are (especially in Canberra) with a singular B.Science degree?\n\nThanks again!",

I don't have those numbers off the top of my head (ANU Careers and ANU Science  have the real numbers associated with employment so I highly recommend talking with them too). Basically if you have a solid academic achievement with your courses WITH that broadness in undergrad (and with extra curriculars) you set yourself up well for employment (and/or postgrad depending on what you want to do). I know in my cohort there were many that went into consulting firms (Big 4 and more boutique firms), government (usually APS, but some in ACT government too), NGOs and research directly out of an undergrad degree/honours. Hope that helps!",

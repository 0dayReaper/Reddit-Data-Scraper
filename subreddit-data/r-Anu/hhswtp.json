    "postText": "Hey so I'm currently thinking about doing the International Relations Honours for post-grad (I'm currently not at ANU) and was just wondering what the admission criteria was like, I'm kind of confused by the website description (particuarly the bit in bold, do I need to have the highest marks in my uni cohort for the equivalent of these subjects???): \n\n \n\n\"AQF Level 7 Bachelor of International Relations from the ANU, or equivalent from another institution, completed within the last two years:\n\nwith a weighted average mark equivalent to an ANU 70 per cent calculated from the 36 units (i.e. 0.75 EFTSL), **excluding 1000-level courses, with the highest marks, which must include 24 units from the following courses which are compulsory in the Bachelor of International Relations:**\n\n[POLS2094](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2020/course/POLS2094) Issues in International Political Economy\n\n[POLS2133](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2020/course/POLS2133) International Organisations in World Politics\n\n[POLS3001](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2020/course/POLS3001) Foreign Policy Analysis\n\n[POLS3017](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2020/course/POLS3017) International Relations Theory\n\nand with the written approval of an identified supervisor for [THES4103](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2020/course/THES4103) Thesis\"",

            "comment": "To me it sounds like the grade is calculated based on the 36 units worth you did the best in (where 24 of the 36 must be related to those mentioned courses) but you cannot include level 1000 courses in that (mostly first year courses). \n\nBasically, they\u2019ll use your best grades you\u2019ve achieved to determine your entry grade but will exclude any level 1000 courses in determining which courses you scored best in. Best to check with ANU but this is what it sounds like to me. Hope this helps!",

HD, D, C) and calculate it from there or do they look at the actually numbers and what you have scored ( eg. 75, 68) and then get the percentage from that?",

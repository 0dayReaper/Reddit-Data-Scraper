    "postText": "G'day all, \n\nI applied for a HELP-FEE loan but have not received a Commonwealth Assitance Notice and CHESSN number. It talks about the census date being the last day an upfront payment can be made and that I need to have applied for the loan by then.\n\nNoting that course fees are due on 12 Mar 21, I'm assuming that this is the census date and at this date the loan will come into effect? The fact that it says 'due' on that date implies that I'll be penalised if I haven't paid them by then, hence the confusion.\n\nApologies if this is a dumb question - just don't want the Uni on my back and have to move money around if my assumption is wrong.",

Any fees that you haven't paid upfront by the Census Date will be deferred to your HELP loan. \n\nIf you have administration-related questions about your student account, pleeeeease contact Student Central to ensure you're given the correct advice.",

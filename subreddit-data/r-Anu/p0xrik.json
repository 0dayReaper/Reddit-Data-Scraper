    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nLike a bunch of other people posting recently, I had just gotten an early entry offer to anu but I had gotten into PhB. How?!! I put it as my first preference but didn\u2019t think I would ever possibly get it. I didn\u2019t even think they would do many early entry offers with such a high ATAR and it being such quality course. If anyone knows, do they usually give out many early entry offers or has anyone else on here gotten in?\n\nAnd yeah can\u2019t wait to see you guys there next year!",

Honestly when I started PhB I there weren't really early offers out there, so can't comment on that. But I had an amazing time during the program and it really was great for my development. \n\nIf anyone didn't get in I highly recommend contacting the school and asking about transferring options into that program in your first or second semesters. Some of my friends transferred from advanced science or general science degrees to the PhB so it is very possible to do so. All the best guys!",

                            "comment": "No worries! I'm currently a medical student at ANU - there's an official pathway to Med school from PhB (around 10 students do that). In my cohort, there were lots of people that went on to do a PhD (some went overseas like oxbridge, Ivys, Stanford etc and a good amount stay in Canberra or as a research assistant).  There were lots of students that went into consulting firms and APS departments as graduates too. I see your  concern about being too \"research focussed\" (I had that too!), but PhB is basically a really flexible science degree that requires a relatively high GPA to show for it. If you want a better picture feel free to email Science at ANU :)",

They definitely did not give out many offers for the PhB specifically, I put the PhB as my first choice and thought I was putting my best foot forward (Got a high distinction in National Physics Olympiad, topped chemistry and physics at my school, did work experience with academics at ANU in year 10 and got a really good reference from my physics teacher who was also has good credentials in academia) but still didn\u2019t get in, so definitely don\u2019t feel like they are just giving them out to anybody,  you should be very proud of getting in, I\u2019m sure you deserved it ;)",

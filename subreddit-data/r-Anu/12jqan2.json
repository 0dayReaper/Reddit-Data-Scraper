This seems to be a relatively new Degree and is being offered by very few Uni\u2019s in Australia. Is it worth and what are future prospects!\nInsights will be very helpful. Thanks.",

            "comment": "I'm doing a double major in physics and Computer science. The only difference from advanced computing and computer science from what I've heard is that computer science has less leeway in what you can do and less systems and software engineering-ish courses. The 1st year mandatory courses are programming 1, foundations of computing, and structured programming. \n\nOverall, I would say it seems less prestigious/rigorous than a traditional computer science degree. So I think if you're up for the challenge you should do a Bachelor of Science in computer science.",

I would say it is quite a good degree, it's definitely not new considering I got accepted into it in 2017 although some changes have been made to it. It has a good split of computing theory and computing practice, I'm not sure where the idea that there is no programming involved came in, but there is definitely a lot of that in many different languages. Overall you can shape it however you want, have a look at the specialisations and majors/minors available on the degree page and you'll get a feel for how you can build it.\n\nIn terms of employability I've had no problem getting a job for the most part and got my first job in computing about half way through and my first serious job in my field in my penultimate year.",

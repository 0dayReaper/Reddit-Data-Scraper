    "postText": "Hi guys, (foreword: i dont actually have my melb offer yet, it comes out on the 15th, but i got my anu offer today so its getting all in my head), do you think that the student life (beyond just studying, but clubs and stuff), as well as Canberra life is worth it/fun? Because I\u2019ve been wanting to go to Melb for a whole year because the lifestyle there just seems so great, but ANU is a much better school in terms of academics and employability rate in comparison, so I\u2019m wondering if the student life and lifestyle in Canberra will be worth the education we get? \n\nThanks guys",

            "comment": "Choosing the right location to study is really important, so if you strongly prefer Melbourne to Canberra, then you should go where your heart desires.\n\nThey are very different cities. For me, I chose Canberra over Melbourne (where I lived) primarily because Melbourne feels too crowded and too busy. I preferred quieter and smaller places to study without sacrificing convenience, so Canberra was perfect.\n\nI know Canberra has a reputation for being a \"boring\" city, but it's really not. If clubbing is your thing, a lot of my neighbours go clubbing together every Thursday. All the clubs and pubs are just a short walk away from campus. So are the cinemas and the theatre. The National Museum, Library and Gallery are just a short bus ride away.\n\nHow much you get out of student life depends on how much you decide to get involved in it. I live on campus, so it was very easy for me to get involved in my residence and in the wider ANU community. We have heaps of clubs and societies, and we compete frequently against each other in interhall sports.\n\nAnother thing you should consider is that quite a lot of people who study in Melbourne are actually from Melbourne and have established friend groups from their high schools. Most students at the ANU, on the other hand, are not from Canberra but from all over the place. I'd say it's way easier to make new friends at the ANU than in Melbourne unis.\n\nI've had loads of fun in Canberra, and I don't regret my choice of moving away from Melbourne at all.",

    "postText": "Hi there, anyone ever taken PHYS 1201(Physics 2)? I'm doing Bachelor of engineering and plan to select Electronic and Communication Systems/ Mechatronic Systems major in the third year. Now I have a slot for an elective this semester.\n\nI wonder if the physics knowledge taught in this class will be useful in engineering major course in later years? Is PHYS1101 more useful than COMP1110 (JAVA) for ENGN undergraduate students?\n\nAny advice will be appreciated, thanks!",

            "comment": "Physics is fantastically useful across all sorts of disciplines especially in engineering, and the teaching method employed at ANU for 1101/1201 is much more about teaching you methods for developing and deriving your own formulas to describe systems, rather than just having you memorise a bunch of ready-made formulas. (Source: current student, did 1101 and 1201 within the last couple of years). I can\u2019t speak to the usefulness or otherwise of COMP1110, but as I\u2019m also a working engineer I can say that no-one I know uses Java for deep engineering work. JavaScript gets used for some things, but I haven\u2019t seen Java since I studied it back in the ancient times (2012).",

I highly recommend it - I\u2019ve paired it up with public policy so I can pursue data driven policy. you\u2019re going to find yourself doing a lot of stat, sociology (but more techy than social sciency) &amp; computing courses. if any of those subjects turn you off, I wouldn\u2019t recommend the course. \n\nalso a few people pair applied data analytics with finance, and this highly appeals to advisory/account firms (pmc, deloitte) &amp; of course, to government. \n\nhope this helps &amp; happy to share more!",

I put Econ / Data Analytics as my first preference when I applied a couple of weeks ago \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e! I was wondering how big the class size is ? It doesn't seem to be a super popular course ! \nI love sociology and computing typey stuff thats really interesting to me!",

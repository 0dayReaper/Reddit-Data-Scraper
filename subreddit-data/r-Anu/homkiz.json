    "postText": "I\u2019m an international student applying to ANU(Bachelor of Pol Sci), University of Melbourne (Bachelor of Arts) and University of Sydney (Bachelor of Arts). Which university has a better PolSci program? Are any of these universities overrated and is there a marginal difference between the quality of the courses or is there a huge difference etc??\n\nI\u2019ve heard that ANU is mainly research focused (and that\u2019s also why they have a higher ranking) and because Canberra is a government city, most jobs would be in think tanks, etc. which is not what I\u2019m interested in. Would going to UniMelb or USyd help me more in terms of job search after graduation? Especially if I\u2019m interested in working in the private sector.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a current international student, here are my thoughts.\n\nThe ANU is your best bet out of all of these schools. We\u2019re ranked higher, our campus is much larger and absolutely beautiful, and our enrollment is less than 1/3rd of USyd and Unimelb. Think 20.000 people instead of 60.000 with an entire suburb of space vs maybe a few blocks for USyd. It\u2019s true that staying in Canberra after graduation will be challenging for international students since most jobs are government or gov contractors, and will therefore require a security clearance foreigners obviously can\u2019t get, but the ANU has frequent employer visits from companies all over Australia and a website where companies recruit recent ANU grads. The international students department also runs several seminars a year with lawyers and migration people specifically for how international students can get a job and stay in the country. \n\nCanberra isn\u2019t just a government town- we\u2019re also a University town. We have ANU, UC, ACU, ADFA, and a bunch of other unis, so there are tons of students from all sorts of backgrounds. It\u2019s also a great place to live with something for every preference. If you like living in big cities, you\u2019ll love Civic (the downtown right next to campus). We have the amenities of any other state capital, but we\u2019re a lot less crowded, and less expensive. Want to live in a proper house? We\u2019ve got low-density housing for days, but with great public transport links. You can have a backyard a 20 minute bus ride from campus. Prefer nature? Campus backs up to trails and the lake, the arboretum and the mountain is an easy walk, and you\u2019re a 10 minute drive from bush on all sides. You obviously make compromises by living in a small city, but it really is the best of both worlds out here. Plus, Sydney is only 3 hours away, so if there\u2019s a concert or a big game you want to go to, it\u2019s really easy to go and make a weekend of it. The bus is super convenient- there\u2019s even one that goes from the SYD international terminal right to the Jolimont Centre, a 15 minute walk from campus. \n\nThe ANU offers things that other schools don\u2019t. Consider Canberra. Life is good here.",

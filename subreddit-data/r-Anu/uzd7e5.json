    "postText": " \n\nHello!\n\nI am thinking of transferring from ANU (currently studying Bachelor of Actuarial Studies/Mathematical Sciences) to a similar degree program at UNSW for term 3. Has anyone transferred between these two universities? If so, how did you find the difference? I heard pure maths is taken at a slower pace at most other unis (compared to ANU) which would be very good for me because I like it a lot but am finding it very hard.\n\nAny advice/comments would be appreciated!",

Trimester system is hated by many as well, lots of burn out. What issues are you having at ANU?  \n  \nI transferred to UNSW (when I did my degree) but for a comp sci degree, I got only like half of my credits transferred. Consider the implications of transferring, it can be pretty tough. Do you have a support network in Sydney? I found it easy to make friends in UNSW but it helps to have family near you if possible.  \n  \nGet in touch with the uni, they can probably tell you what credits you could get if you transfer. Maybe see if there\u2019s a discord for the actuarial society at UNSW and ask people there too.",

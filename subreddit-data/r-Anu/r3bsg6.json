            "comment": "I've noticed you've asked many questions in this sub, and there's a pattern of them being extremely general. I would suggest you ask more specific questions related to your situation.  \n\n&gt; anyone who is doing comp science in anu can you tell me how hard are the assignments?are the assignments tricky and take a lot of work?\n\nVaries by the courses you choose and your personal ability. \n\nIf you choose easy courses, then the assignments would probably be easy. If you choose difficult courses, then the assignments will likely be hard.\n\nIf you go on programs and courses, each course will list the expected workload in the 'Study' tab (e.g. https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2021/course/COMP1100). However, that isn't the best indicator of how much time you will actually spend on assignments as that's based on your ability\n\n&gt; the atar is relatively less than unsw so I think it will be easier..?\n\nATAR is not a good measure of how easy the courses at a university will be. \n\n&gt; I am planning to transfer from unsw and unsw feels tough..any advice will be appreciated\n\nYou should first understand why you think UNSW is tough. Is it because you don't have enough for completing assignments, don't have a good understanding of the fundamentals, etc.?\n\nThere's no guarantee at all that transferring will make things any easier. In fact, a lot of ANU students complain about the more \"non-traditional\" approach here including learning Haskell as your first programming language, Ada for concurrency, and more.\n\nMost people I've known transfer from ANU to UNSW so they can be more exposed to industry in Sydney, not the other way around.",

Your comp elective is just a course with a COMP1\u2026 code (i assume you are first year) and university elective can just be whatever you\u2019re interested in, apart from law and some of the health ones I think. For example one of my COMP electives is COMP1710 and one of my university electives is MUSI1110 (I am also a first year). I don\u2019t know if there are \u201cgeneral\u201d electives people take since it is based on personal preference but if you don\u2019t have anything you want to explore out of the computing degree maybe pick another COMP course or INFS1001 would be of interest to you?",

I\u2019m a domestic undergraduate from Melbourne so I supposedly have a guaranteed place, and today was meant to be the day that all other accommodation offers were released but I didn\u2019t get mine. I\u2019m 100% sure I\u2019ve submitted it because I have the email and I logged onto the portal to check, is anyone else still in the same boat?",

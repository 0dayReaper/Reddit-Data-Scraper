Tell them the degree you want to study, give them your GPA and ask for your selection rank. They can\u2019t guarantee anything but should be able to tell if you have a good chance.",

I had a really high WAM but when I asked admissions before I applied they said credit WAM would give me a good chance.   It looks like Science and Commerce have the same ATAR requirements.\n   \nThis may be wrong, couldn\u2019t find the email when I was looking for it, but I think they told me credit GPA (5/7) is equivalent to like 80+ selection rank when I asked last year. So if I had to guess that will give you a good chance.",

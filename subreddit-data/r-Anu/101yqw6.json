I'm currently applying to several universities in the US but am also considering PPE at ANU. \n\nCan anyone give me a general idea of how good the course is and the opportunities you would get as a PPE student? Also what are (in general) the prospective jobs PPE students get after graduating? \n\nThanks!",

    "postText": "Lately I've been learning a bit of mathematics and it has drawn an interest out of me such that I'd like to pursue it at University, Particularly Ive gained interest in linear algebra and the intuition and basic maths of partial differential equations. Right now I'm over halfway in my Economic policy degree at the University of Canberra but the maths we use in it is rather unsophisticated compared to what I imagine might be learned in a maths degree. How difficult is it to get into the bachelor of mathematical sciences? I might be interested in doing a 2nd degree after my economics one I would like know what pathways would be available to gain entry to this one.",

            "comment": "I don't know exactly how hard it is, but I imagine if you have average grades at UC they'll let you in. Also you can have essentially the same experience and take the same classes in a bachelor of science degree so I wouldn't stress about the bachelor of mathematical sciences degree, the main difference is that the grades you have to achieve to graduate is a bit higher and you're forced to take certain courses which aren't required (only recommended) for the math major in the bachelor of science. \n\nAlso the majority of the masters students at ANU didn't actually major in math (only took the basic math courses required for engineering/science students), so you might be able to do a masters (it'll sound more impressive but be essentially a shorter bachelor's degree with less flexibility).\n\nAlso you might be interested in physics since it involves a lot of linear algebra and PDEs, and once you get to third year you can avoid the experiments. Some of the math taught at ANU is incredibly abstract, it makes PDEs look like arithmetic, so you should consider physics, which is more grounded in reality.\n\nThe hardest part about math at ANU is the math, not the admissions (speaking as a math student myself).",

Would they both be similarly abstract and very difficult? If so, yes, if i were to pursue another degree i might consider physics.",

The MathSci degree forces you to learn a little bit of both.\n\nApplied math is generally much more concrete, but the teaching is often worse. I would say pure maths requires more conceptual understanding, while applied math requires more lengthy calculations or programming.\n\nThe difficulty of a course is primarily a function of the specific course and not whether it's pure or applied, but the harder pure courses are, in the opinion of almost everyone, harder.\n\nAlso, I've heard that honours or postgrad in economics can involve a lot of math, so you might want to look into that.",

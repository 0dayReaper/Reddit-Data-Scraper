            "comment": "Speaking as an ex-PPE student, a significant portion of the cohort chooses to transfer degrees after first year. That is, very few people remain in PPE. Most find that they dislike one of the three subjects, or that the program structure is very rigid and inflexible which doesn't allow for taking electives, going on exchange or doing internships. As a result, a lot of people transfer into a Bachelor of Arts degree majoring in either politics, philosophy or economics and using their electives to explore some other fields disciplines such as languages, a social science etc.\n\nEveryone I know who does Environment and Sustainability likes it, so it's a good choice if you're interested in that field.",

I don't mind the rigidity of the degree as it helps me structure myself better. Thank you, I really appreciate it!",

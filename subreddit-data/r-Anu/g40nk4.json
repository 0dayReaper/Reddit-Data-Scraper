    "postText": "I hate using zoom and lecturers using recordings from 5 years ago. This year started off well but now i have no motivation after being stuck indoors for the past three weeks. Its not what I signed up for especially considering the eye watering HECS. I think I'm going to just switch to Open University since its cheaper and they have more experience running online courses.",

I personally wouldn't go and do Open University since I want to get my degree from ANU and idk how well any credits will transfer, but if that's going to be what keeps you sane for the next 6 months then go ahead.   \nI have a few friends who have just put their degree on pause for the rest of the semester and they'll come back once things are normal - so you're totally not the only one in that boat.",

Especially for first years, this is a hard way to begin to experience uni and it obviously makes it harder to form connections. I reckon take the semester off(if viable) and see how you feel about coming back in Semester 2. Maybe pick up an online tafe course or something to keep you busy and upskilling.",

            "comment": "I'm amazed you're the first to bring it up here. You're paying full price for a third-rate University education. It will get better eventually, but who knows when. Society isn't going to return to normal until we have a Coronavirus vaccine or COVID treatment, I've seen no indication in-person university courses are considered high priority to reopen. \n\nGiven that, I think postponing until the university is open again is very reasonable, especially if you have a job that will continue through the crisis. If you don't have a job already (or otherwise lined up) the question is a little trickier- not a great time to be applying for work. \n\nAs for alternative online learning experiences there's probably something better value than ANU out there but I don't know about OU. EdX is the best online learning platform I've used. But the trick is to get a meaningful degree out at the end of the day. 'Meaningful' is going to depend a lot on what you study and what you want to do with your life. If OU is going to get you the job you want for less than ANU then yeah, do it. If you can find a better online platform that will give you transferable credits then that seems to be a no-brainer.",

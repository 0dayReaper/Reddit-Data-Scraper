    "postText": "Hi all,\nI have recently been accepted into ANU for an advanced computing/engineering double degree. I also have received a generous scholarship for specifically an engineering single or double degree. \nI have heard many people saying to avoid engineering at ANU at all costs, however it would be very stupid for me to turn down this scholarship as it would mean I would have no student debt. I am just looking for any opinions of engineering being alright at ANU? I am planning on doing the mechatronics major, which I would choose going to any other University. \nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",

From what I've seen, a lot of people just subscribe to a grass greener on the other side fallacy when it comes to this. Also, the post that was critical of studying engineering at the ANU on this sub that you've likely seen was a direct copy-paste of a years old whirlpool post, so take that as you will. Simply, engineering is a lot of work and sucks sometimes, so some people will look for anything to blame their poor experience, whether justified or not.",

Comparing both degrees, the classes taken in both seem very similar. Both courses have you take essentially identical first year courses, with the only main difference being that statics is taken in the first year at ANU, while it is not at UNSW. A second physics class is also taken in the first year at UNSW, although based off the description all topics except optics seem to already be covered in the physics course in the ANU degree. \n\n2000 level (level 2 at UNSW) seems to be more of the same, with very similar circuits, signals and design classes taken. The main differences seem to be that mecahnics of materials and thermodynamics is studied in the second year at ANU, while this is not done at UNSW. UNSW does have more maths classes in the second year, although based off the descriptions all topics except statistics and probability are already covered in the 1000 level ANU maths course.\n\n3000 and 4000 level/ level 3 and 4 seems to be very similar again, with classes taken in controls, systems, digital signals, power systems, and general design and projects taken at both ANU and UNSW. \n\nBoth programs of course also have various spots for electives.\n\nHaving looked at that, I don't see how you can say that you have to do a masters at the ANU to get the same level of education, when largely, both programs study the same classes. It's not like the bachelor of science at uni of Melbourne, its a fully accredited engineering honours degree, the same as any other university.",

ANU has ENGN4625 and that's about it as far as I can see.\n\nThe masters has an advanced power systems course and a few renewables flavoured courses that look to be power systems oriented, so as far as I can see to signal a real specialisation in power engineering you have to do the masters at ANU whereas they're latter year undergrad subjects at UNSW.\n\nHistorically ANU didn't offer power engineering which meant it was basically railroading students toward electronics engineering if they did the pseudo-electrical major, it does look like they're sorta addressing that though they're not offering the final year subjects for students to specialise property.\n\nI dunno exactly how much of a problem that is (final year subjects) in electrical but a comparable situation for civil would be trying to get a job as a structural engineer not having done anything on prestressed concrete, or as a geotech and having done nothing on investigations/testing (not knowing what SPT or CPTu are) and not having done any of the subjects on rock behaviour, just the compulsory soils and geotech subjects.\n\nTheoretically you could, and you have an EA accredited degree but in practice you'd have a brutal learning curve. 75% of what I did in my first year as a grad required knowledge that was covered in one 4th year elective.",

That is not actually much of an exaggeration.\n\nANU has recently cut/restructured the school and cut some of the bullshit majors they used to have, and are trying to offer something closer to a normal electrical degree as a masters, but traditionally it's been focused on systems engineering and teaching a hodgepodge of subjects that mostly vaguely resembles mechatronics or electronics engineering.\n\nIt's never offered Civil, Chemical, or real Mechanical or Electrical Majors, and many people graduate and find their degree doesn't actually qualify them for many jobs in Engineering.\n\nIf mechatronics is actually what you and to do and you'd choose it over other majors even at another university, then it may be worthwhile with a scholarship, moreso if you're self driven and plan on doing extracurricular stuff that'll distinguish your more.\n\nDon't let current students blow smoke up your ass over it though, none of them have any idea about job prospects and plenty will move the goalposts to the point where simply not ending up on jobseeker counts as career success.\n\nAlso don't bank on finding a good job in Canberra upon graduation, you might find something but it's not really a place that rewards technical expertise or the sort of personalities that tend to develop it.",

If you move to a city to study there for 4 years it's a major life choice and uprooting yourself again right as you start your career is less than ideal.",

    "postText": "Hey guys I'm in Year 12 this year and I am just thinking about applying to the early admission program at ANU. I am thinking between these degrees:\n\nBachelor of Commerce/Actuarial Studies\n\nBachelor of Commerce/Law\n\nBachelor of Health Sciences\n\nI live in Melbourne and I am not quite familiar with ANU, what are the areas that ANU is usually considered 'better' at? \n\n...and is there any preference in terms of degrees taking the job opportunities in Canberra into consideration, coz I have heard that Canberra have more public service related job internships whereas Syd and Melb have more private sectors. Is that right??\n\nThanksss, any suggestions will be appreciated ;)",

            "comment": "Bachelor of Health Science offers a pathway into postgraduate medicine (Doctor of Medicine and Surgery) but you would need much higher than the advertised ATAR to have a real shot of getting in. It's a tightly capped program (limited places) and most applicants would be people trying to get into medicine, so it's very competitive. But highly recommended if you have aspirations of being a doctor.\n\nANU's law and political science programs are highly regarded.\n\nYou don't necessarily have to stay in Canberra after you graduate so don't let that decide what degree to enrol in. Apply for something you really want to do :)",

            "comment": "Textbooks in arts are pretty rare for most majors, usually it\u2019s just assigned readings and the profs upload any textbook chapters photocopied. Otherwise you could find them in the library or ask around in Schmidposting for cheaper prices. Not sure re commerce, but again most learning at the ANU is via research, not textbooks so they\u2019re pretty rare even in first year (where you do get the odd textbook). The few I\u2019ve had are online via an EBook which typically are cheaper than the physical.",

The library should have copies of the text, usually in both hard and soft copies.  For larger courses there are likely to be second-hand texts (old editions are almost always fine).  You can also sail the high seas for most first-year books.",

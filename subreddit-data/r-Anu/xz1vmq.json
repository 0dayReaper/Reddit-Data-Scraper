    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently in my final semester studying CS at unimelb. I'm interested in Master of Computing (Advanced) at ANU and have two questions to ask.\n\n1. If I apply by 15th December 2022 and get the offer for Semester 1 2023, would I be able to defer it to Semester 2 2023 instead?\n2. As an international student, my IELTS certificate would expire by 19th December 2022 which affects the application if I decide to apply for the January's deadline. Would there be any form of waiving English requirement for those completed their bachelor in Australia?\n\nThank you so much for your time.",

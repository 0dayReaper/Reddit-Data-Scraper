            "comment": "Hey! It\u2019s great to have you joining us :)) I\u2019m a 5th year at Packard (ancient) and I lived in Bruce Main Wing for 4 years. In terms of what to bring, I\u2019d focus mostly on clothing, towels and linen. It\u2019s pretty easy to buy things like groceries, toiletries and stationery when you get here and it\u2019ll just take up space in your bags. It\u2019s useful to have at least one thick, weather-resistant winter coat and enough jumpers/jackets to last you through the year. It\u2019s quite sunny for a bit when uni starts up in February, but the weather cools down pretty quickly throughout March and April. \n\nOther than that, I\u2019d say try to move in as close to the start of contract as you can. There\u2019s heaps of different activities the SRs organise each year around that time that are great for meeting other first-year Brucies, and it\u2019ll give you plenty of time to set up your room, track down textbooks, get settled in, etc before semester starts. I hope that\u2019s helpful, I\u2019d be happy to answer any other questions you had!",

            "comment": "Hey! Current student who has lived on campus for a while. I cannot add much to this conversation already but also recommend setting up backups on your laptop. As an ANU student you get 1TB of free cloud storage which you can access from your phone or another computer/tablet ([https://services.anu.edu.au/information-technology/software-systems/onedrive](https://services.anu.edu.au/information-technology/software-systems/onedrive) ) . It's a niche point but I cannot tell you how many friends I know who've lose their essays or assignments because their laptop broke down. \n\nOther than that, enjoy the ride! \u007fThere'll be lots of support from the SRs and ANU lecturers when you start here :). Best of luck!!",

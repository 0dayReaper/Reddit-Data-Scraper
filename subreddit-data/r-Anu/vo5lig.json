            "comment": "Although I did the courses in 2019, both of the psych courses are quite good. Psyc1004 was significantly better than Psyc1003 just because of the different course convenors. With Psyc1004, you don't have to deal with statistics which can be nice or not so nice depending on the type of person you are. All the topics are quite interesting, although the research participation is a bit annoying. In 2019, for the final exam, we were given 100 multiple choice questions! It was the best exam ever! \n\nPsyc1005 is a must do elective if you're doing a science degree and want an easy, fun elective. It's like a university self-help course and provides you with some real scientifically-based techniques and practices to improve your own life. Each week is taken by a different lecturer focusing on a different area of study. This means the content is quite varied and doesn't narrow down on one topic overly. From memory, it did focus very heavily on scientific studies and memorising hundreds of studies was difficult (especially since exams were closed book and in-person back then), although if exams are online then that shouldn't be too much of a problem. I would 1000% recommend this one.",

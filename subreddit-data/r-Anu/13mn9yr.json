    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am looking to apply to ANU for a computer science/engineering degree but there seems to be multiple options relating to the field so I'm having a hard time choosing one. For context, I really don't have any experience with programming and am looking for the degree that is the most well rounded and can create broader opportunities for me after I graduate.",

            "comment": "There are a few computer science degrees at ANU which are basically all the same and will get you anywhere you\u2019d like provided you do your career prep well. I would not recommend engineering at ANU if you are wanting to work as an actual engineer because their degree options do not translate well into the real world.",

            "comment": "No problem to not have experience with programming. \n\nThe computing and engineering degrees have some overlapping courses but have quite a different overall vibe, so you kind of need to decide the direction you want to go.\n\nFor computing you have to want to learn programming but also how computers work, how to handle software projects, some of the maths behind programming/computing. Then you get to choose a specialisation or major.\n\nThere\u2019s basically three undergrad computing degrees at ANU:\n\n- Bachelor of Computing (3 years)\n- Bachelor of Advanced Computing (4 years)\n- Bachelor of Advanced Computing R&amp;D (4 years)\n\nFirst one is easiest to get into and most flexible. You can add a 4th year later if you want if you get good grades.\n\nMiddle one is most popular, a bit harder to get into given the included fourth year. Still fine to not have programming experience.\n\nThe last one is designed to be a tough program for research oriented students and has a high ATAR requirement. You need excellent grades to stay in the program.\n\nI kind of like the BComp, lots of flexibility but you can take the same classes as the others. you can choose to graduate after 3 years and start working  or stay for a 4th year if you want to take more classes and do a longer project course.",

Here is the link if anyone wants to  check. [https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/BENSU](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/BENSU) \n\nFrom my understanding you pick 24 units per semester and I'm thinking about doing:  \nENVS1003  \nENVS1001  \nEMSC1006  \nDEMO1001  \n\n\nTo anyone doing the same degree or courses  does this seem reasonable? It's possible I'm completely misunderstanding the system which is why i'm checking here.",

            "comment": "So your entire degree is 24 courses\n\nIt looks like you can only do geography as a minor (4 courses) and then do 4 more courses of science electives, or do it as a second major (8 courses). This works out to 8 courses either way.\n\nThe page you linked states that you have to do an 8 course major from one of:\n\nEnvironmental Science\n\nQuantitative Environmental Modelling\n\nResource and Environmental Management\n\nSustainability Studies\n\n\nSo you would have to choose one of these 4 majors to do alongside geography\n\nAnd then you get 8 courses of entirely free electives which can be whatever you want.\n\nSo I'd choose what your first major would be, and then choose your subjects for the first semester to be from both of your majors, and maybe a free elective as well\n\nEdit: there's a course advice session for science students during O week, you could plan out your degree and go there to get advice.",

                    "comment": "Oh that makes a lot of sense. I got confused by the listing of possible majors including geography and other stuff. It looks like the reason they are listed is because you can do a a 2nd major alongside a mandatory one. In that case I\u2019ll probably do Environmental science and Geography.\n\nAs for the 48 extra units. As long as the other course requirements are met - can you just pick any classes that interest you?",

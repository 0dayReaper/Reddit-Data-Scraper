Having currently undertaking the BINSS degree, it\u2019s extremely relevant, contemporary and interesting with what\u2019s happening to the world today. IR would be a little bit more theoretical, but feel free to message me directly if you wanna know more specific details!",

            "comment": "What nang18 said summs it up pretty well, but to go into further detail, essentially the core concept explored through the core BINSS classes (and a bunch of the optional classes) is Australia's place in the Indo-Pacific amidst the rise of China. This phenomena is explored through Realist (conservative, realpolitik thinking), Liberalist (multilateral, diplomatic thinking) and occasionally Constructivist (sociological thinking) theories. I'm in my third year right now so odds are if you're looking at an individual course and want to know more, I'll either have done it or know a fair bit about it, so chuck me a message if you have any questions!",

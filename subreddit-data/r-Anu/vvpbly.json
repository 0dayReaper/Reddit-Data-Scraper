    "postText": "Hi so i\u2019m an international student commencing my first year at ANU this second semester as a comp sci major and i\u2019m having troubles with choosing the correct order of courses for second sem since most people start from first sem which makes it easier\u2026\n\nApparently COMP1600 is compulsory for second sem first year but COMP1100 is a pre requisite for that course so now I\u2019m very confused since i have never taken COMP1100 before (that\u2019s why i chose COMP1100 for 2nd sem instead but this means i won\u2019t be able to take COMP1600 anymore?). Anyone who experienced this can advise me the correct courses i should take?\n\nAlso are there any electives that have less workload but still interesting and useful cuz i gotta choose 2 science/non-science electives to add up to 24 units per sem?\n\nthanks so much!!",

I think you have to choose the courses that are available to you this semester. For 1600,  you'll need enrol it next year semester 2. The order of study will be different from those who start in semester 1. In my case, I really want to try programming as problem solving advanced (1130) but unfortunately I can't cause that subject is only available in semester 1. \n\nWhat I did is that I made a study plan that covered 2 years of courses. Deposit the order of course selection is different from semester 1 students, luckily I think I'll still be able to take the subjects I like and finish my major. My case may be different from yours depending on the major and subjects you'll choose. So basically I think you'll be fine. Just take a look at those future courses and you'll know what prerequisites you need to meet then decide which and when the foundational courses you should take.",

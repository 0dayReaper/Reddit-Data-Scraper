    "postText": "Hi Guys,\n\nMy name is Bree and I'm looking for a bunch of participants to help me with my Honours thesis study regarding how COVID-19 has dramatically changed the learning landscape for Australian University students. \n\nTo be eligible, you had to be studying on campus and then had to go online due to COVID restrictions or had to sit a proctored exam for the first time.\n\nThe survey takes about 20-25 minutes. \n\nAnd you'd be greatly helping me if you can spare the time!  And please tell your friends!\n\nThe survey is here \ud83d\udcf7\n\n[https://unesurveys.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_8dIjvMESeAbYKqO](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Funesurveys.au1.qualtrics.com%2Fjfe%2Fform%2FSV_8dIjvMESeAbYKqO&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cbdahl2%40myune.edu.au%7C8face936d02443ccc8f508d90e8f393a%7C3e104c4f8ef24d1483d8bd7d3b46b8db%7C0%7C0%7C637556830560405426%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=OCBpvekFp9ZZmfSbPohMR9rP%2BLDW6Neo541R53kch4Q%3D&amp;reserved=0)\n\nThis project has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of New England, approval #HE21-047.",

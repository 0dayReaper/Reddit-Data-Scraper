    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nHoping to go into med one day and came across the BHLTH offered at ANU. For anyone already enrolled, how are you finding the course (even if its online)? Do you think it's worth picking over B. Medical Science (that I already received an offer to, I'm wondering if I should submit another application for B. Health Sci)? \n\nAny information would be great, thanks everyone!",

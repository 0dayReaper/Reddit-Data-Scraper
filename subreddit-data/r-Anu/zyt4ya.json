If you want a social environment to transition out of home, on campus might be a good idea. If you\u2019re reasonably put together and enjoy independence, try anywhere in the Inner North or Inner South in a share house.\n\nUltimately budget is probably your deciding factor. You might need to stay very far from campus.",

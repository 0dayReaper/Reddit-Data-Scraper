    "postText": "Me and a buddy of mine are considering taking our post graduate degree in engineering at ANU. Particularluy the Machine Learning and computer vision one.  \nFrom what i can tell the accomodations seems ok. But what i REALLY want to know is how the day to day life is.  \n\n\nAre there any student organisations hosting events and stuff?  \nSuch as Toga parties, raves, disco, game nights etc..  \n\n\nAre there plenty of study spaces on campus or is it allways a crowded mess?  \n\n\nDo you need a car or is that something that is nice to have?  \n\n\nDo people throw parties in the common areas at the campus accomodations buildings?  \n\n\nAre there any clear, coincidental behavoural difference between the people from the different accomodations buildings? Like are all from Davey Lodge brats or everyone from Ursula just hippie?  \n\n\nI realize i have alot of questions, haha. Thank you for reading and thank you if you can answer any of them.",

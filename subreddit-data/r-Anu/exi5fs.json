            "comment": "Heya, recent graduate from Fenner School of Environment &amp; Society here. I've never taken any EMSC class but I can speak to ENVS courses, after 4 years of a double major in Geography and Environmental Studies. I did a double degree, declared 3 majors in the end and had room for 4 elective courses.\n\nWhat are your intended majors and minors? Programs &amp; Courses is a really really good place to help with planning. It's very clear (and I've found easier to navigate than many, many other uni websites). That's always the best first step.\n\nLet's take Resource &amp; Environmental Management ([REEN](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2020/major/REEN-MAJ)) and Water Science ([WASC](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2020/major/WASC-MAJ)) as examples. Level 1000 courses are \"first year\", 2000 \"second year\", 3000 \"third year\". Usually you take them in that order, but it depends on prerequisites.\n\n**How to pick courses**\n\nLooking at REEN, the first segment is \"*18 units from the completion of courses from the following list*\", which means all of the classes on this list are compulsory (each class is typically worth 6 units). If a list says \"*6 units from the completion of a course from the following list*\", but there are three classes listed, you have to pick one of the three. Do this for both of the degrees.\n\nSee what classes you think you will enjoy, go through the course description on Programs &amp; Courses (I'd be more than happy to tell you about some of the courses if you'd like. Bear in mind, I did start back in 2016 so some things may have changed). Take classes that you think you will enjoy and will stick with, because the workload does add up progressively through the semester. ANU academic staff in the sciences do tend to be pretty supportive, from my experience.\n\n**Planning your degree**\n\nMake sure you note which session courses are in (Semester 1, winter session, Semester 2, summer session, etc). Courses with major field trips are more likely to be outside of Semester time (ENVS2017, ENVS2005) or will eat into your mid-semester breaks if they run during normal semesters (ENVS1001, ENVS1004 are some examples).\n\nIt is recommended you take no more than four courses per semester.  You can also take courses during the mid-year winter break (in July typically), or during the year-end summer break (in December, January or early February). International students must take four courses every semester. There is a loophole to this rule, where courses taken in summer break count towards your Semester 1 course load, and courses taken in winter break count towards your Semester 2 course load. I'm an international student so I used that to my advantage.\n\nCheck the prerequisites for all classes you want to take. Some courses require you be in a later year (e.g. ENVS3004 Land and Catchement Management \"*To enrol in this course you must have successfully completed 72 units towards a degree*\"). Some courses require you to have taken some previous courses because they assume prior knowledge (e.g. ENVS3014 Ecological Assessment and Modelling \"*To enrol in this course you must have completed* *ENVS1003* *or* *STAT1003*\"). Plan your degree accordingly, to make sure that you are not left in your third year unable to enrol for a course because you don't meet the prerequisites. (You can try to request special permission, but you may not always be successful.)\n\nOne thing I found about ENVS courses was that there is a *lot* more choice in Semester 2 than in Semester 1. Maybe this is because all the lecturers are off doing research in the first half of the year. Planning in advance for this is important. Sometimes you may be stuck doing one or two classes you don't enjoy in Semester 1 in order to finish your degree on time, but maybe you can use that time to take more EMSC courses - or go on exchange and use up your electives!\n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UAgrabFXdsvwKlu0Qv8zKUjSbwVOgojKpH0NcaS5xGM/edit?usp=sharing)'s the document I used to plan my degree. The first two pages are to plan to meet the requirements my majors and minors, and the last page is to plan my semesters. I hope it helps a little.\n\n**Counting courses to your majors and minors**\n\nHere's where it may get tricky if you're declaring majors and minors that overlap. Some courses may be able to be counted to more than one major or minor. E.g. ENVS2020 Water Science can be counted to REEN or WASC. You can't double-count courses, meaning that when you choose to count it to one of your majors, you have to take another course to count to the other major to still meet the requirements in terms of total number of units taken. In WASC, ENVS2020 is a compulsory course, while in REEN it is part of a list of a few options (\"*6 units from the completion of a course from the following list*\"). You should count it towards WASC as it's compulsory there, but optional in REEN.\n\n**Meet with a coursework advisor**\n\nI'd be more than happy if you want a student perspective on some of the classes offered, but for more detailed stuff, I'd recommend contacting your academic college. Throughout my degree, I had some courses that I wanted to count to my majors that would involve bending some of the rules (e.g. exceeding the *maximum 6 units from this list* rule because I wanted to take more than one of the courses from that list). The only way around this is to seek the advice from an advisor and get approval from the Dean of the relevant academic college.\n\nI'm guessing you're taking a Science degree. The folks at the Colleges of Science are *awesome*, they'll help you with planning your degree. Get in touch with them if you want to speak to an advisor: [https://science.anu.edu.au/contacts/science-central](https://science.anu.edu.au/contacts/science-central) Even if you just want to check that you're on the right track with picking your classes, they'd be happy to help.\n\n**Education Access Plans**\n\nIf you've got a disability, chronic medical condition, mental health condition, or short-term conditions/illnesses that may affect your academic studies, consider getting an Education Access Plan. I had one during my degree, and without it, I would have flunked multiple courses. **\"**Access and Inclusion helps students to participate fully in their program of study, be academically successful and achieve their personal best through the development of an Education Access Plan.\" You'll need documentation to prove your condition. I had a pretty positive experience with them. [Here](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/contacts/access-inclusion)'s more info.\n\nOK! I hope that lot helps. Happy to answer any questions :)",

            "comment": "i totally are with /u/nang18 , focus on the courses that benefit your degree.Look at the requirements for your degree and follow the courses up the years - then work backwards to decide the courses you should do (almost like a capstone). This way you dont corner yourself in 3rd year\n\nFrom my time over there, ENVS/EMSC courses fitted into a few categories.\n\n1. Geology \n2. human geography (this is more \"arts\" than science)\n3. environmental management (more sciencey) / GIS\n4. environmental biology(?) course that were very specific, like dirt, or forestry.\n\nYou can tell which of the above categories they fall into by googling the conveners and finding out their office location. \n\nI found #2 was not for me, and way too \"arty\" than what i wanted, my \"purer\" science students also struggled too. I'm not suggesting those courses are shit, just they were not suited to me/my personality.\n\nThe course i found FASCINATING was the forestry course, that was run as a mid year course. It has nothing to do with my degree, but i learned a lot, and the field trip was great. If that's still on, i'd do it with a friend.\n\nFinally, expect certain courses to be skewed towards a particular degree. For example, the forestry course, it had management in the name, and im pretty sure it was compulsory for people doing Environmental Research Management courses. So as a result, that course is going to be packed with those kinds of students. [In the same way if you do a mineralogy course, its going to be packed with geologists). If it's a first year course, that has a heap of lecturers, then it's more broard, and catering to a wider audience. (at the time, blue planet was like this)\n\nAlso, not sure if they have it still, but at the time, you had to do courses outside your faculty. This is a good time to do something different, expand your knowledge outside the course.",

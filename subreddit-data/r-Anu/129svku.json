    "postText": "Hello. I have recently begun study at ANU this year (I come from overseas) and find ANU and especially the kids at college to be subtly racist, saying the n-word and pulling \u2018asian eyes\u2019. I have so many examples but I could not even list them all. \n\nIs anyone going through this right now? Does it get any better?",

I was at ANU for over ten years and never experienced anything like that, but I\u2019m a local kid and might\u2019ve had blinders on.\n\nThe colleges have always been problematic places. For this and other reasons.\n\nYou should report this stuff if you feel comfortable. There is zero space for it on campus or anywhere else. If you Google \u201cracism anu\u201d there are a few resources, but also consider reporting to your college. You definitely shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this where you live (if you live there).",

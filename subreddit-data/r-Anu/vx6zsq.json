They recommend either zotero or endnote.\n\nhttps://law.unimelb.edu.au/law-library/research-tools/reference-management\n\nYour biggest worry won't be what software to use, but what citation style ANU uses. \n\nGet their citation style, see what it requires, and then you can create it in your reference manager (at least you can in zotero). \n\nIf you need help, then hit the forums. \n\nImo it's worth spending the time to learn to use a referencing software now, even if it takes you a few evening works to get it set for your requirements. You can then have all your references stored in a single database throughout your degree. I have come back and used references in later subjects. It also saves you so much writing time, because you can reference as you write, rather than devoting hours to manually typing out the references. \n\nI use Zotero in the social sciences and humanities and it never goes astray. The best parts about Zotero is that it is more intuitive to use than endnote, you can tag your references, its open source so theres heaps of plugins, you can also easily add notes to your references etc. Just better in every way than endnote (i think endnote is preferred in the sciences because it connects to journal databases more easily, though im not sure because ive never had to connect to any databases in zotero).\n\nedit: so OP i've figured it out for you. ANU uses, as does all unis and the legal profession, the Australian Guide to Legal Citation 4th edition. You can download this style for Zotero, so it's a piece of cake. \n\nDownload and install zotero\n\nopen Zotero. Go edit -&gt; preferences\n\nunder 'styles', click 'get additional styles'\n\nsearch for Australia and AGLC 4th Ed will be there.",

            "comment": "I use Endnote and it works very well for me! I have used Zotero too, have not tried Mendeley. But I recommend installing all of them and seeing what works for you. You can download Endnote as an ANU student for free ([https://libguides.anu.edu.au/c.php?g=902522&amp;p=6585909](https://libguides.anu.edu.au/c.php?g=902522&amp;p=6585909) ). I recommend this hyperlink for Law Specific advice, particularly downloading the right \"Output Style\" AGLC4 ([https://web.library.uq.edu.au/research-tools-techniques/endnote-referencing-software/endnote-legal-referencing](https://web.library.uq.edu.au/research-tools-techniques/endnote-referencing-software/endnote-legal-referencing)) .\n\nI also recommend linking the actual PDF of the document of interest with the imported citation on the software. It means that you can centralise all your highlights/comments/markings on the one software rather than navigating 15 PDF tabs in Adobe.\n\nPersonally I have seen Law students manually type up their references and it being laborious and time consuming. Endnote or any other software can output most of  the citations onto Microsoft Word - if there are any mistakes in that output then you can manually edit that at the end. Hope this helps!",

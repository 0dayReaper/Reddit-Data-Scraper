    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m from the Gold Coast commencing in 2023 and currently considering options for residential halls or even colleges. Can I ask for some opinions on these two halls in case of community and social life? or maybe on other halls who do better in these areas? Thanks and much appreciated",

            "comment": "Bruce and Wright are pretty much two sides of the same coin. The rooms are the exact same except for minor cosmetic differences. Bruce has more amenities and a subsidized bar, Wright is cheaper and has a slightly more relaxed culture because there isn\u2019t an \u201cold Wright\u201d like Bruce has and thus has no traditions to carry on. \n\nHow you do socially has a lot to do with how you get on with your pod (people in rooms near yours) and your floor. Meal times make it easy to meet people in the first few weeks. Both halls tend to form cliques/groups that can be hard to break into once a routine is established. Both Bruce and Wright get a lot of first years. The good news is almost no one in the dorms is from Canberra, meaning just about everyone you meet is also new in town and wants to make friends.",

Is there a thing where they centralise all the international students because they assume that they would wanna be put together? I\u2019m technically classified as an international student but I\u2019ve spent most of my days here in Australia and hung around Aussies 98 percent of the time, I put in a special request to not be located with all the international students if ANU tend to do that? No a racist thing but just preference you know?",

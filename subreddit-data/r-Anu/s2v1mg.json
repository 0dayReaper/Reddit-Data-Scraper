Does anyone here know what exactly I need to study for and prepare for, these selection tests regarding all of, or any of three (preferably Astrophysics)?",

            "comment": "My daughter did the physics one a few years ago - she said the questions were pretty easy and were naplan style questions.   More of the problem solving or inference from data type things. I don\u2019t think you can really study for them.  \n\nIf you\u2019re already do well in these courses then you should be fine - just be aware of your time limits in the test so you don\u2019t miss questions.\n\nWith astronomy I have no experience with the tests itself but having done research in this area - if you already have a basic understanding of fundamentals you will be fine.  Swinburne University had free intro astro courses online and on demand so you could take a look at those.\n\nWhen my daughter did the extension program in Physics - it basically mirrored her year 11 and 12 Physics classes - just out of order.  So she did Electromagnetism at ANU at the end of yr 11 but did it at the start of Yr 12 Physics.  They complimented each other and she found it good to already have learned things.  However - she wasn\u2019t too impressed with the lecturer and still doesn\u2019t have her end of yr 11 exam result \u2026\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "I finished up the anu extension astrophysics course last year. The entrance test was not particularly difficult just generally science knowledge, there is very little assumed knowledge in the test. Predominately it\u2019s interpreting given information and applying to the given scenario. In terms of what to study general maths is probably all you really can study. If you have multiple test back to back you may end up being in the room for quite a while so be prepared for that",

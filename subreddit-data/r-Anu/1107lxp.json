If you can wait till the end of sem one then transfers are super common and are organised by the ANU itself. I can\u2019t remember the exact date but near the end of semester one they open a portal where you can apply to move accommodations. Last year a bunch of my friends applied and they were all able to move. If you are accepted you are given a move in date for the new accomodation. On that date you leave the old one, and stop paying for it, and you move into the new one, and start paying for it.\nIt\u2019s a little more complicated if you want to move now. You\u2019ll have to get into contact with both your head of hall and the head of the hall you are wishing to transfer to. Even then they tend not to approve a change request unless under extreme circumstances. Hope that helps!",

    "postText": "I realise I'm a little late since the guaranteed accommodation deadlines were in December for ANU residences, but I was wondering what the chances of getting a studio at Kinloch would be if I applied within the next 2-3 weeks for sem 2 2023 (or if it's possible at all). \n\nIf there are any alternatives, I'm not too worried about the social scene since I already have a social circle in Canberra thanks to a current housemate. Ideally, I'd like something in the $300-$350 range since I'm only paying $250 for my sharehouse in Melbourne, but it seems like the housing situation around ANU is a bit worse than I expected so I don't know how realistic that is, and would be willing to go higher if needed. I'm open to sharehouses as well but don't really know where to start in terms of finding them. \n\nTo clarify, I'm a current undergraduate student at UniMelb that will be graduating by the end of this semester, thanks to a bit of underloading throughout my degree. I applied to an ANU postgrad program as a bit of a last-minute option a few weeks ago and should be getting a decision soon, although I'm not 100% on accepting it if I get in until mid-late June when my UniMelb decision arrives, which is why I don't really want to apply for a place just yet.",

            "comment": "It's definitely doable to find a studio at Kinloch for Sem 2, and I would recommend getting in touch directly with Lodge or ANU accommodation soon to express your interest in a room. For share houses, it's definitely competitive in the suburbs around ANU, but websites like [flatmates.com](https://flatmates.com) will be your best shot at finding open rooms! \n\nI will say, the studios at Kinloch are around $400+ a week, so if you wanted to stick to your budget you would need to consider a 6-share or other multi-share situation at lodge.",

I\u2019m willing to go higher for a studio since that would be logical. \n\nI\u2019ll definitely go ahead and express interest at the very least. I was also wondering what the reputation of UniLodge is in Canberra? They don\u2019t have a great reputation in Melbourne, not just for the social aspects but occasionally for the living conditions too.",

                            "comment": "I've found the lodge culture ok in Canberra, partly because all the lodges are essentially on campus at ANU it still feels very much like student housing. I will say it isn't very social, a lot of students tend to keep to themselves or have already established friendship groups. It can be difficult to integrate with other residents, especially if you live in a studio, but there's definitely some culture and social aspect.\n\nThe living conditions at Kinloch are pretty good! Especially if you're in a studio and maintaining your own apartment's cleanliness. Kinloch does have the occasional random hot water shut-off or other widespread issue but it's normally resolved quickly. Reception is also generally pretty responsive to any issues, but sometimes you have to press for a while to get results. \n\nWishing you luck with your accommodation search!",

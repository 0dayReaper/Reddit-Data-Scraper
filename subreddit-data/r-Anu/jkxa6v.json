    "postText": "Hey everyone , \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was just wondering about the cost of living in Canberra.I have applied for postgrad accom. and am planning to choose Lena Kermal Lodge due to the affordability.\n\nThat said , i have around 5k in savings and will be slightly supported by my parents while studying. Centrelink also will cover 460ish worth of rent so that helps me out as well.  \n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. I applied in 22 September to get in early, how likely am i in getting that place?\n2. I'm coming from west so will  National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) help me in anyway?\n3. Cheap food i don't need to cook?\n4. Best place for part time jobs?\n5. Any scholarships i should look out for?",

Aldi, woolies or coles is your best bet for cheap food that you only have to chuck in the oven at most. If you mean no cooking at all, you might have trouble finding something cheap from restaurants. Hungry Jack\u2019s and Maccas are cheap and have good deals but they\u2019re obviously not desirable. Otherwise for a normal restaurant meal you\u2019re looking at $10-20.\n\n4. From what I\u2019ve heard, getting a job has been much harder since covid. The best place is literally any place that will take you and that you can get to. Shopping districts will have the highest concentration of jobs (ie. Kippax, Belconnen (the suburb), Civic etc.). The ANU is sort of in Civic, so you\u2019ll probably find it most convenient if you get a job there and line it up with your classes.\n\n5. For scholarships, just google them. Which one to look out for depends on a lot of personal factors as they usually target a specific audience eg. Women in tech. \u201cANU scholarships\u201d should do the trick and look for post grad ones (I think they\u2019re a lot easier to get than undergrads).",

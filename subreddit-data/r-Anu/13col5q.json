If anyone has any advice or pros cons of different accomodations that would be really helpful. \n\nThanks so much \ud83d\ude26\ud83d\ude26",

The downside is that because everyone is more insular, there\u2019s far less of a social scene. But for a lot of people that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re after.",

            "comment": "Aside from Lodge, your options (from cheapest to most expensive) are B&amp;G, Fenner, and Wamburun. \n\nB&amp;G has a great reputation and a really rich culture. It\u2019s a very popular choice, but as the cheapest hall you\u2019re not going to get any fancy facilities or rooms. A lot of people don\u2019t mind this though \n\nWamburun and Fenner are pretty similar, both in price and in that they have more modern facilities. I would say that there\u2019s not much difference between these two, except in terms of location Fenner is more central on campus which can be convenient but noise is also an issue. I think Wamburun is a bit more popular with international students.\n\nYou\u2019re probably going to have a good time at any of these halls. It\u2019s just a matter of how much you\u2019re willing to pay and to what extent you value nicer facilities.",

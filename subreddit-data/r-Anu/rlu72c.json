Science sorta requires you to do a masters to be considered for many roles.\n\nIt was difficult, and although not a direct comparison / it\u2019s anecdotal, but I felt like I had a much larger workload than my friends who studied science in the same year group as me.\n\nThe quality of teaching varied from subject to subject. Some were very good, some were awful and it all depended on the lecturer. What specific engineering are you thinking of doing?",

I'd be studying it as a double degree with PPE. \nI'd be interested in doing the Research + Development degree but would likely need to attempt to transfer after first year.",

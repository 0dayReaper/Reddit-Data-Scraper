    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI am from Perth and have been accepted into the masters of finance course atANU. However, I have a beautiful, friendly and quite large German Shepard named Wilhelm. I haven\u2019t done much research as I received the letter of acceptance only a few days ago. I have been accepted into various others programs from the university of Queensland and Macquarie as well and it seems accomodation isn\u2019t quite a problem as in Canberra but I prefer the course at ANU. So considering I don\u2019t know much about how accomodation works here and especially considering I\u2019ve got a dog that I\u2019d love to take with, what are my options? I\u2019ve seen something about accomodation being offered in acceptance letters or having the option to select when applying but I haven\u2019t seen anything of the sort. Please help!",

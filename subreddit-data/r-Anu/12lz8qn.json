    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am an undergraduate looking for a residence in the school, I have a pretty low budget so should I go for the catered/flexi-catered ones or self catering is cheaper? \n\nCan anyone suggest me one good place to live in. I like music so a music room with drums/ other instruments is prefered.\n\nThanks alot!",

No undergrad is spending $205 on groceries per week.\n\n\nOff-campus options (eg privately rented rooms in sharehouses) will be cheaper still, particularly if 20+ minutes from campus. Going rates might be between 180-250/wk depending on how nice it is and the location.\n\nThere is a trade off for making friends and social activities. Stay on campus if you can afford it. Now however that mid year options on campus may be limited as most new starters commence in February.",

I am under 18 when the semester start so the school only allow me to stay on campus so maybe I'll move out on year 2.\nAlso, are there many places that I can work in near the school and can I work with no prior experience, are the competion for those work high?",

    "postText": "Hey guys! International student here commencing from term 1 2022 in one of these uni for bachelor of computer science/ software eng and commerce. I need your opinion on which uni I should go to.\n\nI got a 50% scholarship from ANU and UTS but Probably will not get any scholarship (&gt;= 50%) from UNSW. I know that UNSW is the most reputable uni for CS but I don\u2019t know if the fee that int students have to pay is worth it. It will also be quite difficult for me and my parents to pay tuition + living expenses. I don\u2019t mind the trimester though. As for UTS, I really like its focus on practical experience but UTS is not part of Australia\u2019s go8. Whereas, ANU is very reputable and have a somewhat similar education quality with UNSW but I prefer staying in Sydney. \nIm just really lost right now and can\u2019t make a decision so please help me out!",

            "comment": "ANU is a much better uni for student experience. We have a massive campus with great facilities and lots of green space, compared to UTS and their one tall building. We also have a smaller student population, which translates into better access to tutors/professors and low wait times for services. Things are less crowded. People enjoy living and working here.\n\nCanberra is a great place to live in as well. We have all the amenities of any big city, but the access to nature is second to none. Our public transit is good and only getting better thanks to the light rail. People say it\u2019s boring, but I couldn\u2019t agree less. It\u2019s what you make of it.",

            "comment": "It all depends on what you prioritize imo. I\u2019m Japanese and in Japan, the name of the uni really matters when it comes to getting jobs so I picked ANU without really caring about the quality of the education.\n\nOne thing I can say is that Canberra is a very good place although it\u2019s not as interesting as Sydney.",

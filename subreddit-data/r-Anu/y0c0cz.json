    "postText": "So I have essentially failed a course and missed the cutoff date to withdraw without failure because the results of the assignment didn\u2019t come out until after the date.\n\nI am completing a bachelor of science which is \u2018minimum 144 units\u2019. Does this mean if I complete more units than that, they will still contribute to my GPA? I\u2019m hoping that I can offset the bad grade.",

Even if you can you definitely wouldn\u2019t qualify for CSP discount/HECS and risk paying full price for it.\n\nIf you think you have failed the course and are worried about GPA the best thing is to focus on the remainder of your courses in your program and do the best you can. \n\nUltimately it shouldn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s one course. Anecdotally I know a few people that did so and it never led to issues with employment. A GPA is just a number for 99% of graduates.\n\nRemember to take care of yourself, especially this week noting it is mental health week.",

If you fail a course you just repeat that same course or pick up another course in lieu of that one (depending on whether it's a mandatory course for your degree). So you will graduate with 144 successfully completed units and 6 units failed (150 total).",

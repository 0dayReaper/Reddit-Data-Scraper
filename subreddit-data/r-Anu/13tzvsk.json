Pursue a passion and then do something semi-related that can also land you a job that hppefully compliments your \"less-employable\" science major so that if thats what you end up doing, you are set apart from the other applicants.\n\nFor example im doing engineering (which i do like dont do anything you dont have a vague interest in) and biochemistry. Realistically the engineering career path is going to be more attractive especially in my first few years out in the workforce but the double degree lets me pursue the biochemistry aspect through things like environmental engineering, nanotechnology, biomedical engineering.",

If you're interested in Defence, perhaps look into the Defence University Sponsorship. They recruit in all types of areas, with a special emphasis on STEM. I know someone who got in but for humanities and basically they're getting part of their studies paid for, have a salary during uni and have a traineeship/grad role once they graduate their degrees. Selection process can take a long time though, so might be worth taking a look at.\n\nI'll note that there are certain commitments regarding time you serve in the role and some basic training, but seeing as they sponsor the study units that are pertinent to them, if you study in a field that they are looking for it could be worth it long term, especially seeing as studying isn't going to get cheaper anytime soon. However, this will also depend if you are willing to serve in some capacity in the ADF.\n\nNot sure what specifically you want to study science wise, but definitely keep your options open - have some mates in science who got recruited in the public but also private sector, and seem to be pretty on track to do well once they graduate. Most do double degrees, in either double STEM area or STEM/Humanities, which gave them lot more flexibility into what industries they could get into easily. I'd encourage you to go to the next ANU Open Day to sus out some options with the Science students.",

You get paid peanuts and get treated like a child. Turnover is so high, they don\u2019t care how great of a worker you are, someone with the same work ethic will replace you eventually. Most departments (histology, toxicology, biochem, etc.) won\u2019t accept you unless you have honours or better (or if you already know someone to vouch for you). A lot of people thought going from commercial to public hospital labs meant you made it. It\u2019s not. Your pay is a little better (a few $ per hour) but you\u2019re most likely going to report to someone who got the job 30 years ago and still has an old school management style. Basically what I\u2019m trying to say is you\u2019ll be doing most of the work while the more \u2018experienced\u2019 people sit back and boss you around. Where\u2019s the money in science? Clinical trials. If you land an entry role in a CRO and climb your way to project management, which can take 5 years minimum- easy $145k+ base a year. If you bounce companies with a pay rise at each jump, you\u2019re looking at $165k+ base doing the same job for 5+ years. If I could go back and redo uni, I would do IT. Everything I learned in uni I don\u2019t use at work and the more I worked in science, the more I realised I don\u2019t like it",

Occasionally you'll get a 2 hour lecture or prac. They suggest 1 hour of self study for every hour of lectures, often you'll do this just by completing the assignments / homework.",

By 4th year it was more like 3 days a week with some planning, and I personally had stopped attending any lectures and tutes that didn't require attendance.\n\nFor your first semester / year, a good habit to get into is going to uni like you would highschool / college. Get up and get in each day around the same time, leave around the same time. Use the free periods to do homework, hang out with new friends, play sport, enjoy the campus, etc.\n\nUnderstand COVID might make that impossible at the moment, but keeping a bit of a regular rythym is pretty important to stay on top of everything.",

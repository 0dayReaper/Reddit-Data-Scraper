    "postText": "I will be starting my bachelor's of advanced computing (R&amp;D) on the first semester of 2022 and I am confused about the electives. I do not know if I'm supposed to choose an elective from the same degree or if I can choose it from a different degree. It's kinda overwhelming tbh.",

            "comment": "I believe the elective courses on the BAC (R&amp;D) course page are actually university electives. Univesitiy elective courses can be any course offered by the university (i.e. not COMP specific). The BAC (R&amp;D) course page does not make this very clear. The BAC course page makes this a bit more explicit by listing computing elective slots and university elective slots. Computing electives are courses that have the COMP tag (e.g. COMP1100).\n\nHopefully this helps:)",

    "postText": "Hello everyone!\nI am planning to go for the Bachelors in IT programme offered by ANU. Regarding this I have a few questions.\n\n1. What are the job prospects for an international student as an IT major after graduating from ANU?\n\n2. What are the key differences between the Bachelors in Advanced Computing programme and the Bachelors in Information Technology programme?\n\nHave a great day!",

BAC has a few more compulsory courses and a 4th year research component. \n\nI was going BAC but just wasn\u2019t keen on the research component after learning about it so I switched to BIT. \n\nI would say both have the same job opportunities outside of research.",

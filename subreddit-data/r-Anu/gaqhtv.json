    "postText": "I'm a first year at ANU studying PPE and had been planning to pick up a Bachelor of Arts in second semester this year, majoring in French with a minor in Ancient History. I was mainly planning to do Arts for a 'fun' degree and continue PPE as my 'serious' degree.\n\nHowever, I've  been considering doing Law instead. I've never seriously considered it before, I thought it might be boring and I wouldn't have the grades for it. \n\nHowever, I haven't been enjoying the economics side of PPE as much as I thought I would, and I've always secretly wanted to do law. I'm hesitant though, as I know actual law is nothing like people think - there's only a very small percentage of lawyers who actually get to spend the majority of time in court, and a lot of the job is paperwork. \n\nI'm looking for advice on what to swap to. I'm going to end up doing a double, and it looks like my options would be.\n\nPPE/Arts\n\nPPE/Law\n\nLaw/Arts\n\nI have no idea what would be best. I want to enjoy uni, but I'm not afraid to put in the work. Thoughts?",

            "comment": "PPE is a waste of a degree (I graduated from it last year). I did very well but hated it and could have done everything in PPE in an arts degree, plus some stuff I would actually have enjoyed. PPE is taught from a very certain viewpoint - rational choice theory, neoclassical economics, and strictly analytic philosophy. \n\nI'm finishing up an LLB and its hard, but good. It goes well with philosophy IMO; the logic in thinking is similar. Whatever you do, don't do law/PPE i reckon, you get literally no electives if you do apart from PPE list courses, but your education should be a bit broader than that if you're interested in even a wider breadth of philosophy or politics.",

You learn one ideologue's view of the world who designed the degree, if you're lucky a couple of list subjects might add a little something something here and there, but not a lot. If you want to learn how to think about politics, philosophy, economics in a broad or critical way, do an arts degree.",

                            "comment": "2nd year Law/PPE here, going to be dropping PPE next semester so I can offer you some perspective:\n\nThe only courses exclusive to PPE students are \u201cPPE integration\u201d courses, of which you will do one per year. They essentially try to combine and integrate the three disciplines. They are, by all accounts, horrible courses that get terrible student reviews every year. They\u2019re run poorly, and are vague and confusing.\n\nEverything else you do in PPE can be done in an Arts degree, or a PoliSci degree, or an Economics degree. In PPE, you lose the freedom to really specialise in something because you\u2019re required to do so many different courses. There\u2019s very little freedom. \n\nEssentially, if you do PPE, you\u2019re doing it for two things:\n\n- The PPE specific courses (which are garbage)\n- The prestige of the degree. Having a degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics sounds nice on paper, the ATAR is like 96, and Oxford runs a PPE degree. But this is a pretty skin-deep appeal. I doubt future employers will be impressed by the PPE label. \n\nIf you instead do some other degree in the Arts/Humanities, like Bachelor of Arts, or PoliSci, you have freedom to do the electives that you want. After starting University you will slowly start figure out what subjects *really* interest you, and in this degrees there\u2019s more room for you to choose your specialisation. \n\nThat\u2019s my take on it, at least. If you have any other questions feel free to ask.",

That's not necessarily a bad thing though. Law is a great degree to get you into all kinds of jobs that have nothing to do with law at all. For example, the Cth public service loves putting people with law degrees into policy jobs because they value the writing/thinking skills law teaches you\n\nIf you were to do law, I'd recommend arts/law over PPE/law. You don't get much more an advantage doing two 'hard' degrees and it will be a lot less fun (although I didn't do PPE so take that with a grain of salt). Doing arts probably gives you a little more flexibility too. Also, don't make this all about getting a job. You don't have many opportunities in life to sit down for a few years and learn about the things you love. Make sure you do something fun/interesting too",

                    "comment": "Economics at ANU really helps prepare you for higher degree research. Even if you are not interested in the research side of it, it is still a worthwhile undertaking. It might seem irrelevant or impractical at first (I understand why this view resonates with so many people), but you need to be patient. What they teach you are basic components, and things will be clearer when you start applying the theories you learn from graphical and mathematical models in your areas of interest. I have worked in the field of development, and trust me, when you don't know your economics, it will be hard to constructively and objectively criticize research reports. This in turn affects the implementation and everything else down the line. Micro and Macro are complementary, and comprehending both sides of economics is crucial.\n\nThe point is you will be given the same ingredients like everyone else. How you cook is more of an art. It needs your ingenuity. It requires you to deeply grasp the subject. \n\nI say go for it.",

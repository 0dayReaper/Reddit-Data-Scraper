            "comment": "You can possess up to 50g of cannabis per person. You can grow 2 plants. Note that the 50g of cannabis also refers to the plants, so you can\u2019t grow 2 huge monsters that yield 500g each. Yes this is a catch 22 because pretty much any cannabis plant will yield more than 50g. Plants also need to be grown outdoors.\n\nIt remains illegal to purchase or sell cannabis.\n\nNow here\u2019s the tricky part: Canberra police are the AFP, and cannabis possession and cultivation remain offences under federal law. Which law (ACT or Fed) the cops choose to implement is at their discretion and they\u2019ve indicated they will be following federal law (they are federal police after all).\n\nWeed will be banned in every dorm. If you smoke it, you\u2019ll need to leave the dorm. Some students might not care, whilst others could be annoyed and report you. What happens with booze will depend on the dorm, I\u2019d imagine some are more accepting of it than others. Best to check with the one you are going to.\n\nAlso, might be best to ease off on the smoke once you\u2019re at uni. Take it from a daily stoner who ended up getting kicked out of uni, before and after semester is fine, just not during (unless you can smoke and not have your grades drop)",

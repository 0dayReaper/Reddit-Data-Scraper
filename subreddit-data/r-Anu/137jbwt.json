    "postText": "I just moved to campus. I'm an international student and been a student for about a year. Classes being online up till this semester made it virtually impossible to meet people naturally. Also, I feel like people aren't as social as pre-covid, across the globe..?\nIt doesn't help that I moved mid-semester and people at my hall don't really interact. Not even an extrovert but I enjoy some social time.\n\nThis might be a long shot but, I'd love to meet up with anyone who's in a similar situation (or not!). We could make a group chat, if anyone's interested.\n\n\nIf you'd like to hang out sometime, please hit me up :)\nEither reply here or DM me. We could chat on reddit first, what you like to do for fun, what you're studying, etc.",

That's why although I joined clubs, timing hasn't been right, but I'm hoping it will be now I'm on campus.\n\nI'll shoot you a DM.",

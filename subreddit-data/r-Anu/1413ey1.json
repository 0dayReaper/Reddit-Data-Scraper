    "postText": "If based on my Year 11 grades (WACE) I have a predicted ATAR of 99.5 (using this calculator: [https://www.tisc.edu.au/calculator/atar-calculator.tisc](https://www.tisc.edu.au/calculator/atar-calculator.tisc)), am I likely to get into FDD Law (LLB and BPPE) as an early offer? Even if I do not rank in the top 2% of my cohort at school, aren't Indigenous, and don't come from a low socio-economic school (so I would have the lowest tier of selection)? Thanks.",

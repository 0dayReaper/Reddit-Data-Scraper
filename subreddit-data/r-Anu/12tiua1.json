    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm making this post because I would like to know how Fenner Hall is. Basically, I'm underage (under 18), and, without thinking, I chose Lena Karmel lodge as accommodation because at the time I wanted my own bathroom, kitchen, and to cook my own food. Now, I realise that I may have screwed myself over in the social aspect of college.\n\nThe problems I find with LKL is that the high proportion of international students and the language barrier makes it very difficult to properly socially connect and party, especially for me as I'm in a single studio. So after consideration, I've decided to move to a student hall. Out of the few self-catered options, there is BnG, Fenner, and Wamburun.\n\nI would like a hall with a heavy party/social aspect while being comfortable to stay at. For this reason, Fenner is incredibly appealing, as I've heard BnG's rooms are old. I also visited Wamburun earlier to see a friend, but didn't like it much.\n\nHow heavy is the party culture at Fenner, and is it comfortable to stay at?\n\nAlso, how would I start making the switch? I heard you could do it in Semester 2.",

It is not a new application, but just a transfer application. I don't know a lot about Fenner, but here's the interhall transfer link:\n\nhttps://anucomb.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalX/3AD1BFA6/8/10/HOME-Home?UrlToken=03547E46\n\nHope this helps! \ud83d\ude0a",

The party culture is pretty standard for a uni college (still pretty heavy) but there's a lot of non-party activities to do if you're not into it. It's pretty comfortable IF you're willing to put up with busy kitchens that are often really gross (clogged sinks, mess everywhere) and communal showers etc. I really enjoyed Fenner because the messy communal living didn't phase me, would recommend.",

            "comment": "It's more common for PhD students to be tutors rather than lecturers. It's not impossible to keep tutoring after graduation (although most profs will want to keep tutoring slots open for their current students), or to pick up some casual lecturing as well, but it's very unstable work where you don't know whether you'll be employed from one semester to the next, and it's hard to do things like sign a rental contract if you're functionally employed 8 months a year max. The rate of pay also isn't that great if you do a good job, because universities radically under-estimate the number of hours that go into lecture prep, assignment creation and marking, course admin, and student supervision. So I wouldn't really call anything about it \"easy\"!",

These are not that well paid given the work and expertise they require.\n\nAfter finishing it is possible to keep up casual teaching, and many are forced to do so given the varied availability of full time research or teaching positions. That said, the union and staff have been pushing back against this rampant casualisation and this seems to be shifting things a little bit.\n\nYour rate as a tutor is dependant on expertise, so a PhD gets paid more after they graduate. For this reason some Schools are reluctant to hire those who have completed their doctorate... But again this varies.",

Let\u2019s say I have a lecture that finishes at 3pm, but another on the same day that starts at 3pm. \n\nIn your experience, would you say most lectures start late or finish early? Do you think it\u2019s doable for me to run 200m or so to another lecture hall and not be late?\n\nThanks everyone!!",

I normally got to the first few in person to find which are worth going to, and if they are not, just to there watch their recordings.\n\nFor lectures that are very interactive, its always worth going. But if they are just going to talk at me (different style but still cool) Id rather watch from my couch. Sometimes watching recordings can be easier, as you can pause and google if needed.",

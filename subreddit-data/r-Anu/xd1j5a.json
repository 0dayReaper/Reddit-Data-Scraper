    "postText": "Hi guys! \n\nI want to take the Flexible Double Degree option at ANU, with Comp Sci Honours and International Security. \n\nBefore I commit to anything though, I just wanted to ask if a double degree is worth it and if it is too much of a work load? Like will I be able to have a good school/social/sleep balance?",

So workload wise it\u2019s the same as everyone else, just stretched out with an additional year. I\u2019m doing a double and my stress/work load is the exact same as everyone else\u2019s.",

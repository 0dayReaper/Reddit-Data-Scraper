I just got my early offer for Data analytics in ANU and when I was applying, I really had no hope and was thinking that they would reject it anyways so I just didn't apply for accomodation. It turns out that I got the offer, but now I don't know what to do about living there. Do I call the uni? Or will have to apply with the atar? \n\nPS: if anyone studies the data analytics course, is it good?",

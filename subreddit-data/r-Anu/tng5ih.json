    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nJust thought we'd hit this place up to see if there are any bassists keen to join an originals band! \n\nWe're all in our early 20s and have been playing around Canberra for a few years now. In terms of style, we all love bands like Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, and love anything 60s/70s rock/jazz, but we pretty much have an open mind for anything at this stage.\n\nWe of course love good vibes and we hope to start gigging again soon.\n\nDrop a comment or shoot me a DM if you're interested!",

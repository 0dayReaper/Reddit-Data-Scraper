There is a difference I find between universities in what the candidates are capable of. But the ranking isn't something I would pay attention to. \n\nThe ranking may be helpful if youre staying in acadamia or looking overseas. But as others have said, the ranking is about the research output of the uni and not the quality of teaching. For some degrees at ANU, the  teaching quality is pretty trash\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Also the teaching quality can change in a subject between postgrad and undergrad too.

I wanna get a job in Australia after I study, so I'm not sure if that's a good major that will allow me to find one. I was also considering computer science too. What do you think of the CS program in ANU?",

But as an international student I'm not sure if that applies. \n\nCS - I felt the courses are geared towards doing higher research/phd/academia more than getting a job after a bachelors. That being said, I did my 4 year undergrad (with honours) and went straight to work and know plenty of people that did the same. There's definitely a good community in CS, especially if you participate in the more social things like the CSSA.\n\nThat being said, there won't be a lot of jobs in Canberra for an international student. Most jobs are government or for-government and need either security clearances/ pr/citizenship.  If a job in Australia is what you're after, I would assume Sydney and Melbourne would have more opportunities.",

Australia has several tiers of Universities though and employers will likely see a Distinction average degree from the University of Sydney as demonstrating more competence than a Distinction average degree from Southern Cross University or the University of Canberra.\n\nThis isn't so much prestige as a recognition that the lower tier Universities don't mark as hard and may have lower standards.\n\nThere is not a significant difference between Group of 8 Universities, and even between Go8 and 2nd tier Universities like UTS, Macquarie, QUT, RMIT, Curtin, etc, especially in subjects where that university is particularly strong (typically Engineering/IT for the former technical colleges).\n\nANU has no employability advantage over USyd, UNSW, Melbourne, etc.\n\nANU has certain areas of strength (arguably languages, asian studies, humanities, probably some areas of science) but the bigger employability question is where you'll get work experience and a grad job. If you're not an Australian citizen you'll typically have a hard time getting professional work in Canberra because most of it is government related.",

There are exceptions (law) but without further detail about your intended degree and the other universities you're considering I can only answer that for most fields your degree is more important than the institution that awarded it to you. To go even further, most employers are more concerned about your skills than your qualifications. Having a degree is important for lots of jobs, but once you're applying for them you might find yourself talking about your degree less than you expect.\n\nOh, I'll also add that university rankings are mostly based on research output and have little to do with the quality of teaching. ANU ranks pretty high because it is a great research university in some fields.",

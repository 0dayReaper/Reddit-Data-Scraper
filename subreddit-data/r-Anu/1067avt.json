I do a double degree so only has 2 med classes, but I had 6 one hour lectures, 1 three hour lab, 1 one lectorial per week, and every 2 or 3 weeks another three hour lab for biology. That doesn\u2019t count the other electives, which would probably be the same. I\u2019d say about 20 hours a week of in person content",

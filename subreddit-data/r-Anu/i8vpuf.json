Always worth following up with the relevant college though!",

            "comment": "For professional psychology registration, you have to do a course which is approved by APAC. Once you\u2019ve done that, you can apply and do masters or honours and some supervised work to become fully registered. The ANU bachelor of science (psychology) is essentially the same as the bachelor of psychology, and both are APAC credited meaning it doesn\u2019t matter which you do. I believe in the bachelor of science some of the electives are a little different, but otherwise it\u2019s the exact same.\nSource: also got an offer for a bachelor of science (psychology) and was stressing about it",

    "postText": "I\u2019m from Perth, and have been looking at the courses at ANU and I saw the Tuckwell scholarship. I\u2019m eligible and was thinking about applying, however I am a bit unsure about how the accomodation works. Would I get to choose which accomodation facility I would prefer, or is one randomly assigned. If I were to attend ANU I\u2019d preferably have accomodation which has self contained bathrooms but I\u2019m unsure as to whether or not I can select this myself or whether they get randomly assigned/reserved for graduates.\nSorry if this is a dumb question, I\u2019ve done a bit of research and all I could find was that if I got the scholarship I would have guaranteed accomodation but never specified what kind. Any help would be much appreciated!",

I chose lodge because I also wanted a self contained room so I'll assume you want lodge since you're after the own bedroom and bathroom so all you have to do is put down lodge for example and you'll likely get assigned to one of the four they have, unless you want another accom. Might have changed since but yeah :) tl;dr- when you apply for uni itself, there is a part where you can ask for what hall you wanna live in",

Can you only stay in one place for a year before having to move on, or is it you have to reapply to keep your room? I also saw there were some labelled \u2018studio\u2019 or \u2018apartment\u2019 as opposed to just \u2018bedroom\u2019. Does anything special come with these titles such as having to pay more for an apartment or is it just saying it\u2019s a different layout for the accomodation?",

All the Lodges have the same amenities, so trying to get one of them is a good plan - and the cheapest accom on campus (Davey/Warrumbul/Kinloch/Lena Karmel). The new Lodge property (Yukeembruk) is way more expensive then the original buildings, but without the benefit of a private studio (shared kitchens/bathrooms). Depends on your budget range, really.

Then say your reasons for wanting it if you have any, eg., physical, medical, mental health, religious reasons. \n\nThe reason for saying you specifically want your own bathroom is otherwise they may try to fulfill your overall requirements without giving you the one thing you really do want, eg., if you said IDK \"independent room\" they could give you a big room with no bathroom; and if you just said \"Lodge\" well there are rooms in Lodge without their own bathrooms.\n\nIdeas from me: be specific about which direction you want your room window to face, eg., if you like sunlight in the morning ask for north or east facing; and/or say you want a lot of windows. In the same vein, know that size, shape and location in room of windows can have a big effect, along with shape of room.This can have huge mental health benefits in winter, so you can put it in as a mental health related thing.\n\nIt is also worth saying if you like opening windows.\n\nIf you super super like quiet, then say that, and you hope they won't put your room right beside the door in to stairs or something.\n\nLastly, really good to say if you are strongly not in to getting drunk and being around drunk people.\n\nEDIT: removed a suggestion to post on r/Anu, since this is already r/Anu",

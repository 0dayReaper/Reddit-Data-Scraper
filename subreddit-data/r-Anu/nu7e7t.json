    "postText": "Hi there, I am a 22 year old female from New Zealand starting at ANU next semester for an exchange. Looking for recommendations on what accomodation to apply for. As I am a fifth year student, I'm hoping for a hall/accomodation which is social and easy to make friends in, but not full of 18 year olds who have just discovered partying. Thanks!",

Good group of people - in an academic and in a social manner.\n\nSelf catered, try Fenner or B&amp;G, staying away from Unilodge. Note that B&amp;G is the cheapest accom on campus and you get a whole variety of people - favourable and unfavourable. \n\nHappy to answer further too!",

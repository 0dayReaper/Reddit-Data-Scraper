            "comment": "ANU engineering is quite peculiar. You have to major in Mechanical Systems if you are going to be remotely close to what a typical Mechanical Engineering student is studying at other universities. I think UQ is the safest if you are just looking for a job as a Mech Eng and not going to research or further studies.",

    "postText": "Hi r/ANU,\n\nA couple of years back I was an international student studying in Unimelb and graduated in 2016. Initially, I took two majors (Econ and IR), but decided to drop econ as it dragged down my grades (my WAM was 64% to be specific). I had personal issues in my first 2 years in uni which affected my mental wellbeing, hence I didn't study as hard as I could've \u2013 also failed three econ subjects which didn't help. However, in my 3rd year (particularly final sem as I only took IR related subjects), my grades got better.\n\nLong story short, I got really lucky and got a corporate planning/finance job in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. I, however, feel like I\u2019m stuck in my current job, as it is quite different from my degree (also I don't really like working in the oil &amp; gas sector, what with global warming and all), and would like to apply for a masters course to help me start a new career. It has been 4 years since I graduated \u2013 I think I\u2019ve now grown as a person, and am now more responsible &amp; ready to get back to uni.\n\nRegarding the masters itself, I am very much into IR (particularly anything related to international political economy), however, I feel like I may need to pick a degree which offers me practical/research skills (as IR, at least when I took undergrad, was quite focused on theories)  The programs I plan to apply for are the following:\n\n\n\u2022\tMasters of Public Policy  (I think this will give me the most practical/hands-on experience compared to the other two)\n\n\u2022\tMasters of International Relations (what I love the most, but I think I\u2019d benefit from a more practical areas of study)\n\n\u2022\tMasters of International &amp; Development Economics (Funny thing, I began to love economics, particularly in the context of politics right after I graduated \u2013 I think I am more well-equipped maths-wise now to take the course. Also, understanding how the economic side of things work would greatly supplement my current understanding of political economy.) \n\n\nMy question is; what are my chances of getting accepted into one of those programs, given my low WAM?",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I accepted an offer to Bruce Hall starting this year\u2026. I was just wondering on your insights to what life is like there (I\u2019m mainly concerned with the social life as I have very basic needs accomodation wise and they all provide pretty much the same thing).\n\nAlso what is the social life/ overall experience like at other colleges/halls? I\u2019m wondering whether I should consider the other options as well (Johns, Wright, Wamburun etc)\n\nThanks for your help!!",

Hazing and peer pressuring has gotten better over the years so just speak out if you're made to do something that you're not comfortable with. \n\nBruce hall is quite diverse from my memory so if you're not into all the partying then you'll probably find some like minded mates.",

I'm sure it won't be too hard making friends cause there are a lot of moving in O week activities. Wright and Bruce have a very party/social life, i think those two halls have the most social people and aspect?\n\nIt's diverse but in 2021, which is the year I started studying, a lot of the people my friends met were from the coastal side of Sydney or City-sider Melbourne people, and often told us about how rich or athletic the people were.\n\nBut they said they were very nice people. Personally from what I heard, the food offered in the Halls aren't that great so I feel like at the same time, if you aren't gonna eat the food idk if you'll get the money back for the food, but its not great, you may as well cook for yourself and live in a lodge.",

Sure, it\u2019s an adjustment moving away from friends and taking on more everyday responsibility for yourself, but it will be like that regardless of where you go. Basically, I recommend living on campus and from what I\u2019ve heard Yukeembruk is pretty good; the facilities are brand spanking new so that\u2019s a plus.\n\nIs this your first offer? There should be a change of preference round, I recommend doing that. They allow you to put in three preferences and explain why you want a different offer. I was successful in transferring to the most applied to accommodation through this. Oh also, if you have any medical reasons why a certain accommodation is important that haven\u2019t been appropriately met by your current offer, you can voice those concerns through this channel.",

Apparently, that's not the case however, I was under the impression the lockdown would not last that long and since Canberra was my residence, it wouldn't make sense to cancel my rent contract as that would result in my homelessness. I, at one point, had negative 300 in my account because I couldn't work and kept paying 250 a week (mind you, the cheapest on campus price) in rent.\n\nI returned to Canberra in November and there was only a month left of my contract (Burton and Garran Hall). The market was extremely competitive, expensive and I lost contact with people who were going to move out. I decided it was better to go homeless and find my feet again rather than pay even more money for a roof over my head. I slept in places I shouldn't have around the University and travelled through NSW and Victoria, living out of my motorcycle.\n\nI ended up meeting many people on my trip and ended living in the Kosciusko's and now travel for work but have since moved back to Canberra (yay!).\n\nUnfortunately, my homelessness resulted in my discontinuation of University (BPPE//BADAN) but since socialising and working with many extraordinarily experienced individuals from all fronts, have been inspired and encouraged to return sooner than later.",

You can always transfer, apply for other options as soon as the application is open and you should be fine.

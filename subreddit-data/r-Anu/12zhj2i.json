The degree might be interesting as a whole but you may have to take a large number of mandatory course that you aren't interested in.\n\nResearch the professors that might be teaching your classes. There is a large number of professors at ANU some are great, some aren't. Find out what other students think about them.\n\nLook at exam structures. Do you enjoy essay writing, practical assessments or timed exams? These are things to think about when deciding on courses.",

It\u2019s fine to choose a degree and use your electives to learn outside of that field, but don\u2019t pick a degree based on employability if you can\u2019t see yourself doing that for 1. at least a decade and 2. studying it for 40 hours a week. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to stay with that choice though, lots of people start out in one degree and end up in another. But you gotta enjoy the content for its own sake or else you\u2019ll get majorly burnt out.",

There's a really nice degree called BFES which stands for Bachelor of Finance, Economics, and Statistics. The cutoff is really high so make sure you get good grades. For science, a physics degree is always nice, but once again depends on where your strengths lie. There's also computer science, which is very challenging and intense but also one of the most employable degrees.",

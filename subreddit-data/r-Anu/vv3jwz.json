            "comment": "Im an ANU masters student in FBE and we got an alias email with our name (firstname.lastname@anu) which is connected with our 'official' email, u1234567@anu.edu.au\n\nTbh the alias is a bit of a pain in the butt to use if you like using an email client like outlook or spark, because you need to use your official email (u1234567) when adding the account, and then register the alias in the client if you want to use it. And the alias is redundant, because your name is attached to any email you send using the official account. If you're just using a web browser to access email, then its best to use your u123467 email anyway because sometimes your alias email doesn't play nice with ANUs systems. So yeah, not too sure why the school bothered assigning us aliases. \n\noh and I also came from unimelb, and their IT and email system was annoying af. If you lost or damaged your phone then you were locked out because they required 2fa, which isn't necessary for undergrads imo. And I had **multiple** email aliases. Student number, firstname.lastname, firstletteroffirstname.lastname etc\n\nThe entire time I was there I was never sure which was my 'proper' email and which were the aliases, because I would use one to login to my.unimelb, another when using my email client..\n\nso count yourself lucky you only have one email address to worry about",

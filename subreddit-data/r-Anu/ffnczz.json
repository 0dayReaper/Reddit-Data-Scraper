    "postText": "As the title says, I have a few questions so I thought I\u2019d put them all in one post. \n\n1. Has anyone got experience in applying to ANU after doing year 13? I decided to do my year 12 part-time, split between this year and last year. I made this decision after having received a conditional offer last year, and when I emailed to see if I could still be accepted in future years despite not meeting the conditions they said I could still apply this year and the circumstances last year should not affect my application. Does anyone have experience doing something similar, and how was the application process for you? I don't know if I have to put in my results from last year, and I don't really want to because the report I have shows that I withdrew or got poor grades in a couple classes without mentioning that I am repeating them this year to improve those grades. \n2. Is anyone doing the bachelor of science in psychology? I was drawn to ANU because of the flexible double degree and the fact that I could combine that with a bachelor in political science. This seems perfect because as plan on going into the field of political psychology. I have heard that the bachelor of political science is really good, but haven't heard anything regarding what the psych degree mentioned is like. I am also unsure about the \"science electives\" mentioned on the course outline on the degree builder site. Do these have to be non-psychology related? Because I am more interested in the social, cognitive, and research psychology classes and don't need other sciences. This also makes me wonder if the bachelor of arts with a major in psychology would be better suited for what I want. \n3. Finally, I know this question is on this sub a lot but I haven't quite seen something that answers my concerns. Are living at the UniLodge accomodations really that bad socially? I was thinking of choosing Lena Karmel, and that is where I applied to last year. I like that it is self catered because I'm vegetarian and just prefer to cook myself to ensure that I get all the correct protein, etc. in my food. But I have heard that it is dry socially. I'm not really looking for somewhere that has too many social events and am not a big fan of the whole eating together in a hall thing, so in that regard I feel like self-catered would be better for me. But I want to make sure that I won't  be totally secluded and will still make some friends if I choose UniLodge. Ive also heard that it is more expensive, but looking at the prices my Youth Allowance should be able to cover the cost of that. I will just need a part time job to pay for food and other living expenses. \n\nSorry this is long, but I thought I should post it to try and get peace of mind about some of my concerns.",

You\u2019ll meet a LOT more people and can always move to UL for later years.\n\nBnG has self-catering, but you\u2019ll also find that there are some pretty good vegetarian options in the catered halls too.",

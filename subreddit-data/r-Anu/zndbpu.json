    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI received an offer to study PhB (Science) earlier this year, but I'm undecided on what I want to do. One of the things I am considering is going into medicine later on. I know there are 10 places reserved for PhB graduates to go into graduate medicine, but I was wondering roughly how many people apply for those reserved spots each year. \n\nAlso, if anyone could comment on what living at Warrambul Lodge is like, that'd be great, cheers.",

Here are all the pathways to med without GAMSAT \n\nhttps://medicalschool.anu.edu.au/study/doctor-medicine-surgery/pathway-programs\n\nWith the PhB, you are also being measured by your academic results and interviews much like Health science students. If you are intending to pursue research as a career then yes the PhB is great. I guess it really depends on if you want to spend 4 years doing research or not. Otherwise, the B Health Sci will be a better fit.",

The PhB medicine interview spots aren't super competitive as most people aren't doing the degree for the pathway (unlike the health science spots which are very competitive). I think last year just over 10 applied for them. But it is important to note that sitting for the interview doesn't mean you will get the spot. They give out 10 interviews, but they don't have to give out 10 spots in the medical program - they could give 0 if they so felt like it.",

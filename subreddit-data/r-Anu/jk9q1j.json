    "postText": "Hey! Kinda self-explanatory title, but I'm wondering if there's any truth to the rumour that there's a mandated allocation of grades per course? I'm asking because I'm currently taking a course in the CBE where the lecturer said he \"doesn't believe in HDs\" and only gave two students in a course of 200+ a HD grade (top mark was 82) on a report we recently handed in, and our final assessment is another report and I'm just not sure where to set my expectations? Surely such a big class can't just have two people finish the semester with a HD grade?",

The lecturer is famous for that behaviour, especially in the Systems courses he occasionally teaches. I have a few friends who did that course and just ended up teaching themselves the material in order to pass unfortunately.",

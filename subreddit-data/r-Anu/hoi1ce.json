That is enough to do a major (48 units) or a minor (24). On the wording of the degree page, it appears that you can chose any minor or major across the ANU, though it\u2019s quite an unusual page (most list the available minors/majors). If I was you, I\u2019d contact the academic contact (Matthew Kirby) and ask him to confirm. Keep in mind that if you do a double degree you won\u2019t have the electives needed to do a major nor a minor in your pols half.",

            "comment": "Fenner is a very new building (one of the three new ones last year iirc) and BnG is definitely one of if not the oldest student housing buildings on campus. Literally the opposite ends of the spectrum. Fenner\u2019s rooms and kitchens are much nicer in my experience, but BnG seems to have a more established culture bc they\u2019ve been in the same building for so long. If you have any very specific questions about a hall I\u2019d be happy to put you in touch with some current residents, shoot me a PM anytime and I\u2019ll see what I can do.",

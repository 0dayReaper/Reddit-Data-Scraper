    "postText": "Hello everyone, \n\nI am curious if anyone on here is enrolled in/has graduated ANU's Master of Professional Psychology? What was your experience of the course? Was it positive?\n\nThere is very limited information about students' experiences of the course, I guess due to it being relatively new.  \n\nSkipping/incorporating the honours year into the degree is a HUGE drawcard for me. However, do students who undertook the course feel like the Master of Professional Psychology adequately prepared them for practicing as a psychologist? Do you regret going straight to masters instead of going the traditional route of honours and then applying for masters? \n\nI am very curious to hear if students have enjoyed it and whether they would recommend it. Also, if anyone knows someone who studied it and whether or not they enjoyed it, that input would also be welcomed. Thanks!",

    "postText": "Good morning, I will (hopefully) be attending ANU with on campus accommodation. I was looking to join some of the Canberra City Band bands, hopefully both John Andrew concert band, and Prism Jazz ensemble (if it starts). I was wondering if anyone was part of these and had any advice on joining them and transport out to practice from ANU campus? Thank you\n\nEdit: punctuation ",

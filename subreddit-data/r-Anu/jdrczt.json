    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a townie student, with the good or bad connotations attached to the phrase, and I\u2019m feeling pretty much not a part of the ANU community apart from being enrolled in the courses. I live off campus and I\u2019ve been finding it difficult to meet anyone and make friends. Lots of my other townie friends who attend ANU feel this way especially given the current health crisis. Does anyone have any advice for getting integrated into the community?\n\nTLDR: Townie student seeks integration into ANU community, advice?",

Essentially it\u2019ll allow you to compete in hall competitions as well as attend social events so that way you meet other townies as well as people from other halls. All the best :)",

Some of my closest friends at uni are from group assignments &amp; tutorials",

I met people in my courses and was in a couple of clubs but the colleges were a world I just never had the opportunity to be a part of, they had inter-college sports and events as well so even people in different colleges seemed to know each other fairly well.\n\nLarge clubs are the best way to meet people outside your courses, and you can meet people with very different backgrounds an academic interests who you'd have never met otherwise.",

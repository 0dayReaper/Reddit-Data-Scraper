            "comment": "I've done the undergrad version which is the same minus some bonus questions in assignments etc.  \n\n\nThe course is pretty good, a lot more practically oriented than most Engineering classes at ANU. For example, he will show you how FEA was formulated with linear algebra but you won't ever have to crunch the math by hand except in the most basic examples.   \n\n\nThe rest is more about trying to gain intuition into why you would model certain objects in 2D, 3D, etc. and how you should optimize your analysis in certain areas like areas of stress concentration.  \n\n\nIt's how I'd imagine 3 weeks being taught by a co-worker would go, only its dragged out to 12 weeks.  \n\n\nThe final exam would have similar questions, e.g. here is a bike helmet, how would you approach modelling this and where are problems likely to arise. Short essay/answers basically.  \n\n\nThe main assignment for the course revolves around modelling various things in ANSYS and following ANSYS tutorials. Pretty handy if you want to work in FEA. How that assignment is marked though, is god awful. For example, you might have a fairly modern computer (last 3 years) that can use 20,000 elements to model an object as easily as 100 elements (i.e. within a margin of a second) but you get marked down because you could technically complete it in 100 elements well enough.  \n\n\nAs long as you know the assignment marking is ass to begin with and thus pay attention to all the little clues he gives you prior to your submission, it's absolutely fine.   \n\n\nCertainly easier than most courses. You wait for the ball to drop and crush you and it never comes.",

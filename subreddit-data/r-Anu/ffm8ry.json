    "postText": "I'm applying to ANU at present, and have reached accommodation preferences - this stage of the application process has stumped me a bit, so I'd like a bit of help from past applicants.\n\nI assumed we put down 1st, 2nd, 3rd prefs etc from our most preferred to least appropriate colleges - in line with this, I was going to put down Wright (flexicatered) then Bruce, Ursula, etc. as I would strongly prefer a catered setup next year and Wright's location is convenient for my faculty. However, we're only allowed one pref it seems, and I'm concerned that picking Wright as my first choice would make it more likely I'd get a self-catered place than if I chose Bruce or another fully catered college. Are my concerns unfounded - will it be assumed that I want some sort of catering option - or should I be careful about this? I feel like I'm massively overthinking a simple process haha",

            "comment": "I enrolled back in 2019 and I do remember it being limited to one preference. I also go to Wright Hall and can comment more on the catering situation if you\u2019d like but in terms of where they put you if you don\u2019t get your first preference, I\u2019m not too sure how they do it but I know a lot of people that applied for places like Berg and Bruce who didn\u2019t get in went to Wright, and I\u2019d assume (don\u2019t quite me on this) that if you weren\u2019t to get into Wright, they\u2019d either put you in Bruce or Unilodge. \n\nYet again I\u2019m not 100% sure about the process but I do know that all colleges have to leave a certain amount of spaces open for first years (due to the accommodation guarantee).\n\nHope this somewhat helps",

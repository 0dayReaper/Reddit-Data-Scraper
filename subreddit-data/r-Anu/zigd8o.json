It\u2019s located right next  to kambri and the on campus pub Badger &amp; Co. and is on the way back to many of the Daley Road res halls, so some undergrads, particularly drunk and rowdy first years, will make it their business to wake up the whole of Fenner on their way back from the clubs. Disgusting behaviour but there\u2019s nothing the uni can do about it. \n\nI have a friend at Fenner who wanted to transfer this semester because he did one semester there and hated every second. It\u2019s like living at BNG honestly, but at least BNG is quieter. Barely.",

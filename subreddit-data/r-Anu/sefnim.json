I\u2019ve heard from everyone who does BINSS that it\u2019s very practical and relevant, but I\u2019ve also got to take into account that political science may be more employable. Can anyone weigh in on the pros and cons on each?",

I\u2019ve enjoyed more the courses through the BPSC side of my degree, but there is A LOT of application to modern problems dealt with through BINSS. One thing I\u2019ve found, which you\u2019re right about; is that the BPLSC courses are probably more focused on theory and philosophy say than BINSS with is more practice and application. While both degrees will require you to read a lot and follow current events - certainly BPLSC is going to be more immersion in academia, scientific method, domestic policy, australian democracy, bureaucracies as well etc. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about competition/employability here. Both degrees are very relevant to our climate today and will leave you in a strong position to launch at the end. Plenty of jobs available as well (albeit, less in security, but the skills are transferable**), which always helps. Best of luck!",

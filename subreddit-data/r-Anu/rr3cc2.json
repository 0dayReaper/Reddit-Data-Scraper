    "postText": "Is anyone here doing either (or both) of the above degrees? If so:\n\n1. How much harder is the maths in each degree compared to year 12 double spec? And therefore how much more work will I have to put in?\n2. Does anyone know what the job prospects are for simply doing a bachelor's degree in maths? I've heard they're not great...\n3. Is doing both the above degrees as a double degree going to be very hard? Would I be better off doing just a single degree in actuarial, considering I only did a few hard subjects in high school so have not really prepared myself for doing quadruple maths :///. I am hesitant to do just actuarial because I'm not sure if I'll like it. I don't know anything about economics and stuff and I'm not great at statistics, but it seems to be my best bet to get a job. I also don't want to fail by overloading myself with hard subjects though...\n\nWhat was your overall experience doing either of these degrees?\n\nThanks in advance",

            "comment": "Hey mate, current actuary and past ANU actuarial student here.   \n\n\n1. I'm not sure what double spec is but maths degrees tend to have an emphasis on pure maths and is generally way harder than your high school maths (even in first year). That being said if you're super interested in that side of maths then I would encourage you to do it. For actuarial, the maths subjects aren't that much harder than what I remember from high school, but the later stats courses are pretty intense.\n2. I think people tend to pair maths degrees with other degrees (engineering, actuarial, etc.), but I would guess that those that do pure maths are looking for a career in academia. However, you can probably go for certain consulting jobs and I know for a fact that some companies do hire maths students for their actuarial jobs, although it is quite rare nowadays. Could be wrong about the above since I wasn't a maths student so if someone says something different then take their word over mine.\n3. I don't want to sugarcoat things for you so yes doing both degrees will likely be hella difficult, although I do know of a couple people that did actuarial + maths so it is possible. If you're keen/interested to do both I'd say give it a shot at the very least and you can always change your mind later down the road. Stats subjects have more calculus and linear algebra content than you would think, to the point where I reckon some stats courses are on par with maths courses, and honestly the economics and finance part of things is more peripheral than anything. All that being said, I wouldn't encourage you to do anything that you're unenthusiastic in just because there are better 'job prospects'.\n\nHopefully that helped you a bit. Flick me a message if you want more details about anything.\n\nBest of luck mate.",

I'm not really enthusiastic about pure maths either, so it wouldn't really be a compromise if I did actuarial instead. \n\nI feel like I still haven't processed how hard uni will be but if, like you're saying, first-year actuarial isn't much harder than high school I guess giving the double degree a go wouldn't hurt, seeing as I can always drop one degree if I want. We'll see I guess.\n\nthanks for taking the time to write that. It really helped &lt;3",

Luckily the mandatory 1000 stat and econ courses are fairly easy so you'll have time to work on it. The more comfortable you are with your spec/double spec integral calculus the easier the content will be.\n\nAs best I can tell, the pure maths courses are harder again. If you haven't decided, take 1115 and 1116 instead of 1113 in first year, which leaves the door open to do either degree down the track",

Would recommend taking MATH2222 at the same time as MATH1116 if you have room as its a good crash course for proofs. I read Lara Alcock's How to Think about Analysis and a bit of Anton and Rorres linear algebra before the beginning of semester and that set me up pretty well. Best of luck mate.",

In terms of actuarial and other qauntitative job prospects in Australia I have found the majority of listings require experince using dataset pogramming languages. Therefore, I believe a good combination with actuarial studies is the bachelor of applied data analytics, which also has many overlapping courses with actuarial studies, allowing you study more mathematics courses as electives and potentially allowing you to potentially major or minor in mathematics if you choose. \n\nAs far as difficulty of the courses, you can look up some of the practice tests and exam solutions. Although this probably isnt too usefull. \n\nI would love to know what you ultimately decide on.",

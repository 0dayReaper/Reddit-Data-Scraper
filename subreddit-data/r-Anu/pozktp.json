I've got a couple of questions, in terms of internships in the public service does the course give you a lot of opportunities to explore these options? And also how do find the course in general, is it engaging? I'm really interested in foreign policy so I think the course could be the right fit.",

In regards to the course itself, i love it, very practical and relevant course, teaching us about this issues in todays world (compared to IR where it would be more theory based)",

I still do four courses per semester. \n\nThe only difficult thing is trying to reconcile the requirements of the two degrees, like my timetable got a bit messed around by a course moving from sem 2 to sem 1, so I couldn't do another course until next year. Because of that, I've decided to only do courses from one degree this semester rather than using electives for the other course (if that doesn't make sense, ignore it, you sorta just figure out where everything fits like a jigsaw when you choose your courses)",

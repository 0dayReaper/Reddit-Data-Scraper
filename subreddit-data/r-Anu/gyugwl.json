    "postText": "Hi,\n\nHas anyone had much success applying for credit towards a postgraduate coursework program? \n\nI hold a bachelor's degree from ANU that I think should be eligible for credit, but looking into the nitty gritty of the course awards policy there is a 7 year limit for postgraduate credit and I graduated 9 years ago. I'll chat to the program convenor, but curious to hear other people's experiences.",

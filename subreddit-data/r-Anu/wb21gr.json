My favourite novels were \"Taras Bulba\" and \"The night before Christmas\" by Gogol, a Ukrainian. \n\nWhat's infuriating me is that instead of doing proper unbiased research and independently making conclusions people blindly follow the narrative prepared by media and emotional group sentiment. \n\nAlso, isn't university should be apart from politics? Why should I, internation student, receive political emails on my student account? If I knew it would happen, I would invest my money elsewhere.",

Deaths of civilians and soldiers are the consequences of political decisions of governments and their leaders.\n\nIn his speech in 2007 at Munich Security Conference Putin clearly expressed his stance against the expansion of NATO towards Russian border and against the unipolar world geopolitics led by the West. He has been warning about the use of power for many years. I don't support Putin and his warmongering actions. But the western support of Zelensky and his neo-nazi regime provided Putin with the excuse to use military power against a bordering nation. He clearly stated that \"the goal of this special military operation is denazification of Ukraine\". \n\nI say it again. I'm not against Ukraine. I am against this man and his neo-Nazis.",

By \"NATO expansion\" what you are referring to is countries voluntarily deciding to join a purely defensive alliance. Something they should have every right to do.\n\n2. 2022 aside, NATO hasn't expanded towards Russia since 2004 when the Baltic nations joined. Since then only been a few nations in the Balkans have joined, far from Russia's borders. This cannot be considered a plausible provocation for a conflict 18 years later.\n\n3. Russia has it has consistently invaded its neighbours. Moldova in 1992, Georgia in 2008,  Ukraine in 2014, now again in 2022. Not to mention their brutal repression of Dagestan and Chechnya. With this in mind, any claim that they're attacking a neighbouring nation for some altruistic notion of ridding the nation of Nazis is laughable. They're expansionist.\n\n4. Zelensky grew up in a Jewish, Russian speaking family. He isn't some nazi who has a race ideology around Russians being inferior. Azov having some Nazi members doesn't make the whole nation suddenly a neo-Nazi state.",

If you hamper the war effort of one side, you automatically help out that of the other. Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one.

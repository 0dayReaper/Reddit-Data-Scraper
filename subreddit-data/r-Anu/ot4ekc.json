What can they actually do?",

You're then given a deadline to pay the fine by the court. If you don't pay the fine a court date is set for you. If you don't show up in court you're held in contempt, fined more, they suspend your license and record a conviction.\n\nI know this because it happened to me! I left the country and received an ANU parking fine in my absence. I attempted to renew my license upon returning to Australia two years later and discovered it had been suspended! I had to schedule a court date and have my contempt of court conviction overturned. They dismissed the thousand dollar court fine but I did have to pay the original parking fine and a late fee.\n\nSo that is what they can do :)",

I got a fine waived semi-recently for accidentally parking in a residential space with a surface permit.  I think I was technically within the 5 years for good behaviour too (I'd gotten a ticket 4-5 years before, which was also waived for good behaviour).",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm a current year 12 student who is looking to study at ANU next year, but am really struggling to understand the admissions timeline. I am not looking to do early admission, but from my understanding of the timeline (which states that \"applications open march 1 2023 and close may 15 2023\"), there appears to be no other time period to apply. I am struggling to articulate my confusion, but I hope it makes sense.\n\nTo summarise: when would one apply to anu, without doing the early admission thing.\n\nCheers in advance!",

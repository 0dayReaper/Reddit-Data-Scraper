Try the housing group within anu (you need to verify your anu email address) or flatmates. Turn around time on them is usually only a week or so, would just get an airbnb for a couple of weeks and sort out inspections then.\n\nAlternatively, have a look at unilodge at canberra uni instead. Around 30min away by bike and a lot cheaper.",

            "comment": "When I lived at Fenner last year, rent was $231 per week and I received $294 per week from Centrelink through Youth Allowance, Rent Assistance and the Energy Supplement. I largely found that I could live off the $63 per week for essentials (e.g. groceries, mobile phone recharges, etc) if I was smart with my money, but discretionary spending (e.g. eating out with friends, purchasing a new iPad, etc) came out of my savings. Thankfully the difference between rent and Centrelink payments in previous years was large enough that I was able to save some money in prior years.\n\nIf I was living in the ANU accommodation system next year, I'd either try to move into B&amp;G or consider getting a job to cover the difference, as the costs have increased year on year without much respite. I'd even consider living off-campus too, but it depends on whether you're comfortable living with a small group of friends or random people.\n\nKeep in mind that receiving at least $1 of Youth Allowance per fortnight means you'll also be assessed for eligibility of other payments (e.g. Rent Assistance, Energy Supplement, Relocation Scholarship) as well as the Student Start-up Loan, so make sure you factor any other potential payments in your calculations.",

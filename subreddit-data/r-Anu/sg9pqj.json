If you're doing a double degree, it normally is 2 from one degree and 2 from the other. Your degree page should also show you a degree template planner which you (are recommended) to follow - just so you do all the pre-requisite/compulsory subjects in order. Here's an example of mine:\n\n[https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2022/program/BINSS-BCRIM](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2022/program/BINSS-BCRIM)\n\nThen you click the study tab, and scroll through that page. \n\nHopefully this helps!",

DEMO1001 probably makes the most sense but up to you :)) \n\nfor an IR minor: https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/minor/irel-min \nyou need to do POLS1006 in first sem and POLS1005 in second sem. \n\nfor an ancient history minor: https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/minor/anch-min\nCLAS1003 is the only one offered first semester so you\u2019d need to pick that, and you can pick either ANCH1013 or ANCH1014 second semester. \n\nso an example first semester for you might look like: DEMO1001, POLS1006, CLAS1003 and an elective of your choice or a second year demography class! \n\nhope this all helps :)) i\u2019d recommend picking your minor (or just doing both) now so you can figure this out asap!! also electives can be literally ANYTHING that interests you, have fun",

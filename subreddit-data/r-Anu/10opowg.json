Davey from a functional perspective is probably the \u201cworst\u201d \u2014 no AC &amp; and not very modern interiors (feels like a creepy Soviet prison inside, but the rooms are still nice. I say this a non-Davey resident - we do enjoy some banter between buildings, so take with a grain of salt) (LK is the newest, then Warra, then Kinloch), but it still has a great, close knit culture if you know how to get involved. Lodge is really what you make it, and if you go to events, hang out in the common areas, and learn how to cook a few meals and enjoy the benefits of not paying for a catered hall, it\u2019s great. They\u2019re all really close together, and we do a joint o week which is a massive vibe, good way to meet people across the Lodges. We\u2019re also super close to the CBD (the closest of any hall, except maybe Fenner/Toad). \n\nNone of the Lodge\u2019s have ovens (unless you\u2019re in a share), so would 100% recommend getting an air fryer. \n\nI\u2019m in one of the Lodges, feel free to PM if you have any Q\u2019s",

    "postText": "Will be starting my BA at 23 S1 and am looking for advice on course selection. I'm not sure what courses I'll take in my first semester. Many of the courses appear to have restrictions that I am unable to meet at this time, and many of the remaining introductory courses have non-take-home midterms and finals that appear to account for a significant portion of the course marks. Are they going to be difficult? Or is it simply moderate?",

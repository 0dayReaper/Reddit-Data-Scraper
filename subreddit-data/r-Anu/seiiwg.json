            "comment": "I'm in the master of economics program so I've gone through the graduate diploma year you'll be going through. This is just my own experience so you take it with a grain of salt. You don't really need a graphing calculator. Just a simple one would do; I still use the same one back from my highschool days. Reason why you don't need it so much is because you'll mostly use the built in functions/calculators in softwares or programs for your stats/econometrics classes while your micro, macro and math classes mostly involve algebra, linear algebra and calculus (some real and functional analysis will come in the second semester of your program).\n\nSo, it's not necessary to get graphing calculator. If you need to use those functions such as graphing or solvers, there are plently of tools online that you can use. Then again, most of my assessments and exams were online and this upcoming semester might be a little different. Hope it helps!",

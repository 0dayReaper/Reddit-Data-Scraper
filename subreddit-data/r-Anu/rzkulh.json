Trying to get youth allowance on top of working a job but centrelink is being a bit tricky\u2026.\n\nI was just wondering what your experiences with paying for uni (and accomodation) has been like and how you manage it. Open to any advice!\n\nThanks :)",

Luckily Canberra almost always has jobs open so as long as you get in early and are willing to work enough shifts you can survive pretty easily. (The Canberra jobs Facebook page and Seek.com are good places to look)\n\nHowever there are much much affordable on campus options, you can save a lot by going to self catered accommodation and meal prepping. \n\nAdditionally ANUSA programs like grocery grants ($50 bucks a Sem, always granted) and student bites (Weekly massive food giveaway supported by OzHarvest) are huge supports\n\nWorking enough to survive can be rough socially so if you are able make an effort to spend time with friends. Badgers and your Hall bar are great spots to have a drink on the cheap and Uni clubs are good ways to have free events to go to where you\u2019ll see the same faces",

            "comment": "As Zoltaen said, all courses will be made available online. However, whether or not in-person delivery will be offered, that depends on the course convenors.   This means that you don't have to be on campus. But, if you can afford to, it's a good idea to be on campus for the various educational facilities, the learning environment, and networking opportunities. Even if a course is offered exclusively online, there may still be offline consultation/office hours. Get to know the academic and admin staff. They will be of great assistance to you in the future.",

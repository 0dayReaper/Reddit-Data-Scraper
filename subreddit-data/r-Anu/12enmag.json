    "postText": "I was on the Tuckwell page earlier today and decided to inspect the photo of the current Tuckwell scholars to pass time, haha. I happened to notice that of the 95 or so scholars in the photo, perhaps 5 are recognisably South-East Asian and 1 or 2 at most seem to be South Asian (Indian, Sri Lankan, etc.). The rest all appear to be white (I'm aware this may not actually be the case!)\n\nRecently I've been reading some interesting articles on Woroni about the distribution of the Tuckwell Scholarship regarding location (urban/regional/etc.) and SES. That got me into the headspace of wondering whether ethnicity also unofficially comes into play when an applicant is being considered for the Tuckwell. I've seen a couple of comments joking about this on the subeddit, but it's a bit hard to tell sometimes if it's based on truth or not...\n\nI know there are many factors in play when they look at your application, and I'm in no way suggesting the current scholars don't deserve to be chosen, but now I've had the thought it won't leave my brain until I get answers \ud83d\ude05\n\nCurrent students, if you can shed more light on your take on this, that would be amazing. Thank you!",

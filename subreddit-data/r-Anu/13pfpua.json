The difference between Bachelor of Computing and a Bachelor of Science in computer science is that a BS is usually more conventional. Bachelor of Computing is rather unconventional. Especially in American universities, if you're getting a computer science degree it's usually offered as a BS.",

            "comment": "I'm taking a CS degree, mainly because I'm double majoring at it makes sense to double major under a science degree (I take physics and computer science). \n\nA Computer Science major (under a Bachelor of Science) is much more flexible than what is offered under advanced computing. Advanced computing requires you to take more compulsory courses and do extra courses such as projects and research methods courses. \n\nOther than that, a Computer Science degree offered under Bachelor of Science is more conventional than a Bachelor of Computing. Bachelor of Computing is likely to have highly applicable content. It would still have some theoretical content in it, however.",

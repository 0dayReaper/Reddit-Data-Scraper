I have been trying to work this out for the past hour and I am very confused, any help is appreciated.   \n\n\nP.s Does this mean I am postgraduate? (Sorry if this is a dumb question, im just having alot of trouble navigating this process.)",

Is this because they have not started applications for 2024 yet or because start of year applicants have to be direct applicants (Finish year 12 this year)?",

When I applied last year I did see options for starting in semester 2 2023 so I would have expected that there would be an option for applying for semester 1 2024. The good thing about UAC is that you can call them up and ask for help and they will generally be a good help, I had to do that once or twice when I applied.",

I can\u2019t quite remember the process to set up your account but it will cover it on the site. A postgrad is for someone who has already completed a Bachelor\u2019s degree. If you decided to then do a Master\u2019s degree, that\u2019s when you would be a postgrad student and apply directly through ANU instead of UAC. This is because UAC primarily manages Commonwealth supported courses (usually undergraduate degrees).",

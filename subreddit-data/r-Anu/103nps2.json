    "postText": "Hi all, last year I deferred my studies for the back half of the year. I\u2019ll be going in sem 1 this year and was a bit confused on how my compulsory program requirements line up after missing sem 2. \n\nFor example, I\u2019ve finished 1/4 of the compulsory courses last year yet the next compulsory courses are all 2nd sem courses. Do I just have to pick other 1st sem courses from the other course lists or am I screwed?",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I was just wondering, is it possible to book rooms in buildings such as Hanna Neumann (rooms like the level 4 collaboration room), or forestry building such as the conference rooms if I'm an undergrad student? I would really like to study in quieter areas such as these.\n\np.s. how does one go about getting afterhours access to buildings?\n\nThank you",

    "postText": "Hi guys!\n\nI am posting this on behalf of a friend with a physical disability studying Computer Science and Mathematics.\n\nMy friend has a physical disability, which means that he cannot type or write on his own very efficiently. He is looking for note-takers to work for him. The job would mainly involve writing down notes when he is studying at home or on campus (lectures, tutorials, labs...).\n\nMy friend would need 4 or 5 scribes available to work between 10 to 20 hours a week on a casual basis ($30/h). He would need someone with their own vehicle and relevant knowledge in a similar area (e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Data Analytics). The job would be ideal for someone studying Honours or pursuing a Master's degree/a PhD.\n\nIf you want to apply (or ask further questions), please send an email with your CV to [scribeposition@gmail.com](mailto:scribeposition@gmail.com)!",

Also, lectures are recorded anyway. \n\nWanting to pay 5 different people to do everything for you, and wanting them to have knowledge in specific areas, sounds a lot like your friend is trying to cheat...",

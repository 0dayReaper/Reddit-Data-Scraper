    "postText": "tldr; am doing a flexible engineering degree at anu, and am concerned by the course structure and lack of realistic and applicably targeted majors i.e. mechanical, civil, and the extra 2 years required for a true electrical... whether i can actually use them in a job application. Should I try for a different course or university AND HOW SOON COULD THIS BE ACCOMPLISHED, (side note, what electives do you recommend for the first semester)? \n\nSo I just about never post on reddit, sorry if its not the most clear.                I chose engineering because i loved maths in year 12 and like problem solving and wanted to learn useful skills and knowledge, not just for a career choice, but out of self-respect and a desire to become someone who has that. \n\nI was enrolled in a comp software engineering degree that was cancelled because I deferred and it was no longer offered, and so went with flexible engineering. I hail from Sydney but wanted to get away for a breath of fresh air and what with associated costs, covid and laziness didn't opt to go overseas, but rather ANU which is still a reputable university. \n\nUpon choosing my course enrollments I was investigating the degree structure further which I should have initially done, but had not expected it to be so skewed in that it was not a regular formatting. I am concerned with other peoples feedback on where engineering at anu can get you, and am figuring out what to do about this. If it is still very feasible I will proceed with probably some sort of mechatronics degree, but this had not been my intention. \n\n Should I try and transfer for a computer software degree because i would like to learn about computer software anyway, and can do it in my first semester in place of an elective, or should I do a random non-applicable elective, or else begin a minor or major in perhaps environmental engineering or something\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would be partial to an environmental degree or something alike to it, but I am concerned whether it will correlate well with future job requirements considering now how anu has structured things.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not sure what kind of degree you have chosen or the course you\u2019ve enrolled in, but the flexible double engineering is the same as a flexible double of advanced computing. If you haven\u2019t accepted your offer yet, they will give you a choice of either engineering or advanced computer science, as well as one other degree from an extensive list. You can easily start with engineering and change degrees after a semester, as many courses in first year are pretty common in many degrees. Hope this helps",

But the grad dip has very specific enrolment, which you can find here: https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/decon \n\nClick on the \u201cFirst year advice\u201d tab for what you should be doing. If you\u2019re not doing the courses they\u2019ve outlined, you won\u2019t graduate. \n\nIf you mean tutorial enrolments, check each course page here:\nhttps://wattlecourses.anu.edu.au/ \n\nEach course should have a description of what the tutorial/workshop/seminar requirements are.",

            "comment": "Not in Fenner Hall, but in the 2nd semester of the Grad Dip Econ. \n\nYour first semester is ECON7073 - Microeconomic Analysis, ECON7074- Macroeconomic Analysis, STAT7055 - Stats, and EMET7001 - Maths.\n\nIf you're studying part-time, then take ECON7073 and EMET7001 first. \n\nThe people teaching EMET7001 and ECON7073 are different from who taught me, and you'll find that the staff teach each differently, so I won't comment too much. This is especially true for ECON7073, where some jump straight into intermediate micro, while others prefer to teach a blend of intro and intermediate micro. \n\nFor EMET7001 your assigned textbook is 2016 Sydasaeter, and you can find the solutions manual for it on libgen. I'd recommend getting it, and trying to do as many practice problems as possible for each topic. Week 1 covers sets, and tbh I think Sydsaeter's coverage of it is a little shit. The first chapter of Hammock's 'Book of Proof' is, imo, a better coverage. Can get it from [https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/](this link).\n\nWatch out for the STAT7055 exam, it caught me out. The questions on it aren't too difficult, but you're under severe time constraint. If you don't finish it, as I didn't, then your final grade will take a big hit, as mine did. Oh, well, learnt my lesson there. Gen will tell you to make sure you can complete the practice exams he gives you in the time given on the cover sheet, and tbh those questions are more difficult than the ones on the exam. \n\nFor ECON7074, make sure you don't just rely on the lecture notes and actually read the textbook and do questions from the textbook. Unfortunately there's no solutions, afaik, but it will help with the final exam.",

            "comment": "1. Lock your food, room, and bike. Applies to every college, even if it is \"safe\" you just need 1 person to ruin your day.\n2. Go to every college related social event. Hang out at the common areas. Say hi to everyone.\n3. (Within the rules) decorate your door/room etc. Make it yours. I had a sign on my door in another language, and someone knocked to introduce themselves. We had a good chat because I like that country. If it was just a blank door with my name, nobody would know.\n4. Don't go nuts with buying additional shit - especially furniture. I brought speakers and a bunch of useless tech that in hindsight was cumbersome, and an annoyance to everyone else. \n5. If you don't drink, then consider joining even more clubs. Additionally, don't feel ashamed about it. If there's a sore spot, don't feel obliged to give them the real answer. \n6. I strongly recommend not wearing headphones in settings you'd like to be social in. It's just that extra barrier.\n7. Ask if there are 2nd and 3rd years doing the same subject. Chat then up. They'll give you tips. \"No you don't need that textbook\" etc",

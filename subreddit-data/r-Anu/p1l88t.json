I got accepted into a Bachelor of Health Science and offered a place at B&amp;G hall for accommodation. I\u2019m a trans guy and was wondering if any other trans students had advice or warnings about being out at the ANU. Teachers to avoid (especially if they work in STEM), dangerous places on campus, ways to navigate communal housing safely, etc. Any tips/anecdotes/whatever would be appreciated - looking forward to seeing some of you next year :)",

            "comment": "Hey- not trans (so take this with a grain of salt) but definitely an ally. If you are planning on living in B&amp;G it is a long walk across campus to the city, which can be a little dark at night if you like the drinking party scene or even the campus libraries, but I\u2019ve never heard of anything happening there. For the most part ANU is super left wing, so I\u2019d think that the culture is likely to be pretty accepting. I don\u2019t live on campus though so can\u2019t tell you much about how the communal housing works.",

If anybody in a residence or course gives you shit, the residences managers/residence queer department will be willing to happily jump on the case, and if they're bad at their job (as some are) the ANU Queer* Department will be happy to get onto it. They're a really good support network if you need it, but as someone who's quite open about their sexuality (although still cis) I've never felt particularly threatened or judged by anyone.  The one thing I'll say is that you should do a lot of homework about the general attitude of any colleges you're considering because there are some (especially Johns) that have an awful reputation for sexual assault and toxic frat-boy culture.",

I had a few trans friends there, and in general there\u2019s lots of pride events and LBGT+ social events. One friend came out as trans while we were both living there and the whole b&amp;g community seemed to be very supportive and celebrating her. As a cis person myself, of course I don\u2019t have the same experience when I was there but I think you\u2019ll definitely meet other trans students once you move who will be able to help you navigate as well. Especially at B&amp;G, I think you\u2019ll have a good time there.",

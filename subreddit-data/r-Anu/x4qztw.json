I know it's different between every student but it's fine i just want a glimpse of what i should expect. Pls, if u don't mind, share ur experience no matter wht course u take. Thanks!!\n\nIs ANU good for software engineer and marketing? I looked up google and it says ANU is good for software engineering. So i just wanted to double check from the students themselves. \n\nIs ANU heavy on green energy company?? Like developing new tech / ways to combat climate change. My goal was to work in climate energy industry, specifically solar power. \n\nIf u don't mind, pls share ur tips and tricks too for international students. Thanks a lot in advance!!!",

            "comment": "Hey, i'm not super sure about whether you can combine marketing and software engineering - but i'm fairly certain ANU is great for software engineering. There's also a terrible skill shortage for software/IT engineers in the ACT, so it will be easy to find a fairly well paying job soon after graduating.   \n\n\nI found it pretty useful to directly contact the college marketing team (not the central one) and they usually are open to putting you in touch with students directly.   \n\n\nI hope this helps. Cheers! :)",

I've been in your place before and found lots of help, so let's say i'm doing my bit to pass on the favour.  \n\n\n\\^ Not too sure what you mean by that. I'm assuming you mean research based or industry based.   \n\n\nIf that's the case, i'd say there's a fair balance between the two and you can pick and choose your own courses depending on what stream you're interested in. Students interested in doing a PhD usually end up picking courses relevant to research and the others do coursework modules. The uni provides a lot of support in deciding/sussing this out as well",

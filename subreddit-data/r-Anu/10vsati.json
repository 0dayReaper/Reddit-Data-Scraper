I\u2019m male, 6\u20192, big bloke and have a high protein diet so lots of meat, and can easily spend $150 a week, excluding eating out which could be another $50-100. \n\nJust remember your first grocery shops will be by far your most expensive, as you have to buy a lot of things that you won\u2019t have to buy again, or atleast all at one (seasonings, oils, sauces, etc). I think my first was like $250-300 and that was to just get the basic everything\u2019s.",

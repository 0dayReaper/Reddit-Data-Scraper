    "postText": "Just finished applying yesterday and my agent told me to expect the results on 1st of March. I was told that ANU gives either 50% or 25% scholarship on initial grade assessment. I did A levels and have 2 A* and 2 A. What are the chances of me getting 50%? If I somehow did not receive the scholarships, what other scholarships would be recommended for me to apply. I am planning to go double accounting and finance in BComs.",

Also in a couple of societies/clubs so there are meetups or events happening occasionally. I have a job and manage to fit in all academics + free time in my personal experience. Fair warning that some weeks can get more intense than others work-wise! Hope this helps",

If you're not keen on cooking, somewhere like Bruce/Wright or Burg is better because it's catered, altho they are quite expensive. Other self catered halls like b&amp;g and fenner also have super good social lives because everything except for your room is a shared space- in short: I personally rlly liked and recommend lodge this yr because of the studio apartment aspect but if you're still looking for that social aspect whilst still cooking for yourself then def somewhere like fenner or b&amp;g is good!",

I don't know for sure but they may only let people sign up who have tried out?\n\nInterhall Sports runs a short volleyball season in Term 1 so unfortunately you would have to wait until next year. (If you are not in a residence look up Griffin Hall)\n\nIf you decide not to go with ANUVC check out the Volleyball ACT website, it has info on the different local competitions and links to other local clubs",

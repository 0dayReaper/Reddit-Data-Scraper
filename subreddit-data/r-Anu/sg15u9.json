Just tried Chifley and couldn't get in.  \nI'm from a diff uni (interstate) and in Canberra for a few more weeks and just need a study space (the dining table and chair at the airbnb is killing me).\n\nAlso, good cheap food anywhere around Acton?\n\nTIA",

It's an awesome marinade. There's so much on there I want to eat, I'll just end up ordering too much, I can see it...\n\nEDIT: sorry I figured out the law library is called just \"Law library\"...lol",

I applied for accommodation before Dec 20th, meaning that I am guaranteed accommodation, however today is the cutoff for acceptance/payment and I still haven\u2019t received anything. Has anyone else had this experience? I\u2019ve already been accepted into my degree, I just don\u2019t have a place to live. Should I just try phone them again and hope they eventually pick up?",

Managed to get ahold of someone on the Future Student Inquiry line and she took my details and said her supervisor would escalate to the accommodations team. Nothing else to be done on my end really, just have to wait for an email. Pretty poor tbh\u2026",

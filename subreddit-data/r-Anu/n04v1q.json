Is the workload (stress) noticeably different away from campus? Is online actually any good?\n\nAny help is appreciated.",

Time zones have fucked me over, so I stay up until the early hours waiting for classes to begin, but if you dont have that problem youll be okay. Ive been really satisfied with the remote teaching this year :D workload id say is the same though",

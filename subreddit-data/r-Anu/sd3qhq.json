    "postText": "Coming from overseas and being a first year student, I had no idea there was an expectation to apply for accomodation before getting an offer from ANU. This means I only got my accomodation application in 11 days after even the **non guaranteed** applications close. \n\nRealistically, should I be searching for off-campus options? Or should I still get some sort of accomodation on campus?",

I strongly recommend contacting ANU accommodation (https://www.anu.edu.au/study/accommodation or +612 6125 1100) to explain your situation. They scan help with potentially seeing if there are other spots or the best way to search for off campus accommodation. Best of luck.",

But otherwise yes, I\u2019d suggest looking at off-campus accommodation. Get onto ANU housing and take a look around - I think the ANU housing co-op might still be taking applications too. \n\nAlso - congrats on your offer !! You\u2019ll love ANU and we\u2019ll see you soon ;)",

    "postText": "I am currently studying remotely and not on campus but I should be by next semester and I\u2019m planning to live on campus. I am looking at self catered accommodation options but idk if I want to live in a hall or a lodge. I\u2019ve heard the halls have a better social life (being an extrovert I don\u2019t want to live in an isolated building). Is that true?\nI am leaning towards B&amp;G but also looking at Fenner Hall. \nAny tips/comments/insights? \n\nThanks x",

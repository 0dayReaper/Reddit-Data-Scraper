    "postText": "Hello. I'm currently a year 12 student who just finished his HSC. I'll probably be coming to ANU next year, and I just wanted to ask how easy would it be to get a job in Canberra with no job experience, since it has a really student saturated population? I'm going overseas this holiday with family, which unfortunately rules out getting a job over the summer hols. \n\nSo how easy/hard is it to find a casual or part time job without experience in Canberra as an undergrad student?",

Furthermore, being in Canberra would that limit my avalibility to internships in the banking/finance sector",

I think there's also austudy or youth allowance but I'm not entirely sure how they work as I wasn't an Aussie citizen. \n\nIn regards to internships, there are plenty of public service internships and grad jobs in Canberra, most just require a credit average. Private sector jobs are more abundant in Sydney and Melbourne.",

    "postText": "Hi !\n\nI am posting from a friend of mine, who received an offer on the 13th of January. Most of the scholarships he was interested in didn't have a clear application process, and students were supposed to be automatically considered. He hasn't received any scholarship offer yet, and he was wondering: does that mean that he was assessed as not eligible, or do scholarship offers come out a bit later?\n\nThank you!",

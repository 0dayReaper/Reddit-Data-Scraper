Also ask what their currency conversion rates are, and then shop around. \n\nIt\u2019s dead easy to open and close a bank account here in Australia. Check here\n\nhttps://www.finder.com.au/foreigners-open-a-bank-account-in-australia\n\nYou\u2019ll likely also qualify for a student account, meaning no account fees. \n\nIf you can still use your current bank without any fees, then I can\u2019t really see the point of opening an Aussie account. But if they charge fees per transaction, or their currency conversion rates are poor, it would be worth contacting some of the Aussie banks in the link above and getting them to quote a currency conversion rate, and the you move all the money you think you\u2019ll use in one transaction.",

    "postText": "Hi !\n\nI am posting on behalf of my boyfriend, who has just submitted his application to study Engineering at ANU.\n\nHe has a physical disability and therefore requires support from scribes. He is currently trying to recruit up to five scribes to write notes during lectures/tutorials/labs/exams but above all during library/home study. He is looking for people who could also assist him with transportation to and from campus. The job is paid $30 an hour.\n\nScribes should:\n\n\\- be available between 10 and 20 hours a week.\n\n\\- have a background in Mathematics/Engineering/Physics or Computer Science\n\n\\- have their own vehicle and a driving licence \n\nTo apply, please send an email with your CV to [alpage92@gmail.com](mailto:alpage92@gmail.com). \n\nThank you :)",

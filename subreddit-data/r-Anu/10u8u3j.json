Is there a large difference between COMP1130 and COMP1100? How different is the assessment content as the assignments and weighting themselves are the same.\n\n(I have completed HSC Mathematics Advanced or ACT Methods equivalent)",

            "comment": "Ok so COMP1100 is the first sem course in Haskell and functional basics, and COMP1130 is the advanced course equivalent. COMP1110 is the second sem followup and so I'm assuming you mean COMP1100 in the title. I did the HSC last year and I would say COMP1100 is good for adv, 1130 is the ext/ext 2 equivalent. 1130 is a direct extension to the 1100 course: you learn the same things but the advanced course learns lambda calculus in separate lectures and are expected to complete harder coding exercises each week. I would say you should choose 1100 because all 1130 work is still accessible to you.",

The other assessments include these other topics so they are a bit more difficult than 1100 assessments.\n\nPersonally I'd recommend 1100 as well, I did 1100 last year and a few people I know changed degrees because of how much they hated the course. I also had no coding experience when I started uni and it was difficult but doable if you work hard enough, Haskell is just a weird language",

I did 1130 and I would say it makes them at least twice as hard. The exams also replace the easiest 1100 questions with harder problems and lambda calculus specific problems. The other comment here is saying that some people found the course to be a nightmare, but I think that was only a few. Everyone I saw who was willing to work hard and seek help when needed was fine.",

I started in 1130, and as fun as it was I was struggling to keep up with the extra lab work, extra assignment work, and extra exam questions. However, I absolutely cruised through 1100 and scored 77 despite missing the mid-term exam.\n\nIt\u2019s up to you - if you\u2019re pursuing programming I would give 1130 a good look, even if it is more difficult.",

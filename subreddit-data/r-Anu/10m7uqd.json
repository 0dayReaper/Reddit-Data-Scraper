    "postText": "Hi I'm an international student applying to ANU with the grades of 45 in IB and the scholarship team emailed me the following\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Our office has been informed by Admissions team that your unadjusted ANU selection Rank has been changed to 99.75 after your IB was successfully remarked.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We have considered your application again for the ANU Chancellor\u2019s International Scholarship with your new ANU selection rank. Unfortunately, we have received many applications with very high academic merit and your application was not academically competitive to secure the ANU Chancellor\u2019s International Scholarship.\n\nSo how tf can someone doing IB get the international scholarship if 45 isn't enough???\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: They emailed me the selection rank had changed to 99.95 and now they will give me the scholarship.",

            "comment": "They\u2019ve changed the way IB marks are converted to the ATAR. What it means is they look at how high your marks were in each subjects (e.g. was your 7 one percent over the grade boundary or 10% - how strong was each one). This means that each IB score has a range for ATAR scores - e.g. a 43 = between 99.3-99.55. This is the first year of this new system. Makes it a lot fairer mate.",

I\u2019ve just checked the conversion - obviously didn\u2019t do my due diligence - and yeah you\u2019ve been done in OP, if you got a 45 then 99.85 is the minimum.

Your IBAS score is 99.75, which is still extremely good though. I did IB and got a 41. Also, I'm pretty sure IBAS 99.75 doesn't translate to a 45 - you must've gotten a 44 IB.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m considering undertaking my masters at ANU. However, I completed my IR and politics undergrad at a lesser known uni and don\u2019t feel confident I\u2019ll fit in or be up to the expected standard of ANU. \n\nI\u2019m a distinction average student but again, at a much smaller uni. I initially got into ANU for my undergrad but decided against it because I (like now) was convinced I wouldn\u2019t be smart enough. \n\nWhat are your experiences with masters programs at ANU in terms of pressure, fitting in and culture? I.e., I don\u2019t handle competitiveness amongst students very well, is this a common experience at ANU?",

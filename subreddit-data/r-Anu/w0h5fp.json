    "postText": "I\u2019m apart of one of the colleges and going into semester 2 I\u2019m feeling extremely lonely. While I was super active and social during o-week at the start of the year I kind of shelled up hard after studies began and basically became a recluse. Now, going into next semester it feels like all the groups of my college have solidified and I\u2019m kinda fucked when it comes to making friends. Just wondering if anyone has any experience of being in a situation like this and how to escape it.",

You will make new friends at college / uni this semester, but as u/-Vuvuzela- said - you need to get out there - going out the door is 80% of making new friends.",

Obligatory 'didn't go to this school'. \n\nI was the same as you. I was super reclusive my first quarter and felt extremely lonely. My second quarter, I put my feelers out and joined a discord group for my college. Made a bunch of friends. Friends graduated, and I joined clubs.... my 3rd year of college.\n\nIt's never too late to find friends or to join a group. I'll say though, as someone who has gone through it all- try to join clubs earlier than I did! I regret not having those extra years with the people I could have met earlier. GL.",

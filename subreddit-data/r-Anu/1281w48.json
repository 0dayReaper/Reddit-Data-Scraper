    "postText": "Hi everyone I've been thinking about studying undergraduate physics at the ANU. How does it compare with something like the undergrad physics course offered at uni melb?\n\nI compared the course content but apart from that what does the whole experience look like? Comments from anyone who has studied physics and has completed it would be amazing!\n\nThank you so much for reading \ud83d\ude4f",

            "comment": "Hey! I'm in my 4th year of doing physics, I can't speak for what it's like at Melb but I can say I've loved the experience at ANU. \nAll the professors in physics are really good teachers, they're all super chill and very approachable for any issues you might come across, I've felt very well supported. The majority of the courses feel very refined and well managed too, they're enjoyable to take.\n\nIts fairly easy to get research projects as well if that's something that interests you, there's often a lot of cool stuff on offer and all it takes is asking. You can take these projects for course credit and they're good experience.\n\nHope that helps, feel free to reach out if you have any more specific questions : )",

            "comment": "I'm doing Physics 1 right now and it's basically swayed me to decide to major in physics at ANU, I love it so much. The lecturer for Physics 1 is Professor Paul Francis and he's the nicest guy and also a great teacher. \n\nAll the lectures are online and then you do practice problems in workshops and loads of practical stuff in labs. At first I was really worried about this because I did nothing in online school and didn't think I'd be able to learn much from lecture videos but they actually work really well for me. Instead of being one massive lecture video you have to watch each week, there are a few topics you cover in a week and each topic has a bunch of small videos that cover one aspect of the topic. After each video there will usually be a question covering what you just learned.\n\nThis format works really we because instead of spending loads of time sitting in a lecture then having to go home and do a bunch of work to understand it anyway (like for maths), you can just do the lecture and the processing at the same time and then head into the workshops to apply what you've learned the week before. \n\nPhysics is definetly my favorite class right now, although if you are considering taking it make sure it's PHYS1101, not PHYS1001. PHYS1001 used to be taught by this amazing person as well but he's on paternity leave and the replacement is *not so good* from what I've heard. If you've taken high school Physics you'll be ready for 1101 and it won't be a problem. However if you haven't taken high scool Physics I'd honestly consider just working really hard to understand all the content in 1101 because I've got friends in 1001 and they aren't having anywhere near as much fun I am in 1101.\n\nHope this helps!",

                    "comment": "\\^this is a really good point. A few years ago ANU physics adopted this model of watching your lectures online and spending all your class time doing hands on problems with your professors and tutors.\n\nIt's really effective and much easier to learn with so now it's the standard for most physics courses in undergrad, so this is what most of your classes will look like.",

            "comment": "ANU has one of the best *undergraduate* physics programs in the entire world. It's definitely in the top 10, and potentially in the top 3.\n\nPostgrad is also really good, but not as prestigious as places like Harvard. Definitely still the best in Australia.\n\nFun fact: ANU was founded after WWII to focus specifically on nuclear/atomic physics and Asian studies",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm an incoming International student enrolling in July, and I've been having issues choosing between which dorms to choose. Right now, I'm thinking between one of the **UniLodges** (LK or Kinloch), **Wamburun Hall**, or **Yukeembruk**. For me, I probably put cleanness as the number one priority, follow by location, and social life. \n\nFrom what I've read, there's a lot of negative reviews surrounding the **UniLodges** (no social life, high turnover rate, \"not what people are expecting\", bad services, etc.), yet some reviews tells a complete opposite story. So, I'm pretty confused. I like that it's in the city and has its own bathroom and kitchen. But I was wondering if the rooms are in a good state when we first arrive (i.e. clean, all the amenities working, etc.) and...well...is it actually *that* bad? To be honest, it's a lot of the negative reviews and uncertainties with the amenities and service that is holding me back from choosing the UniLodges. \n\nOn the other hand, Wamburun (2019) and Yukeembruk (2023) are fairly new, but expensive and far from campus. Because it's new, I believe the facilities it offers should be clean and in good condition (please correct me if I'm wrong though-) . But I also heard that the rooms are small (is it?) and its \"really far\" from the main campus and the grocery store. At first, I really wanted to go into **Yukeembruk**, but I've seen a lot of people who got an offer to stay there wanting to defer it. Is it really that bad? There's extremely limited information on Yukeembruk, so I feel like I can't judge it properly. I also saw that there's types of rooms with \"ensuite bathrooms\", so I'm assuming it's like the UniLodges where the bathroom is in your bedroom? But I haven't seen pictures. And as for **Wamburun**, other than what I've seen said about Yukeembruk (being far from campus), I heard that there's a lot of alcohol (?), drugs (?), and that the bathrooms and showers are dirty. \n\nTo be honest, I personally want to go to Yukeembruk, but I'm scared about my own transportation and safety, especially at night or during winter or rainy seasons. And also, I considered Fenner Hall at one point too...but I'm really put off by their bathroom and showers- \n\nCan someone give me an insight into the situation please...thank you ;-; I'm kinda desperate-",

            "comment": "I was a first year Kinloch student and have stayed in the same room for second year. There\u2019s a social life here if you want to be part of it, but what I love is that unlike many of the halls, you can get around it when you want to. \n\nWhat Unilodge lacks in social life though it makes up for in location. I\u2019m 10 minutes walk from the city, and I\u2019m 10 minutes walk from anywhere I\u2019d need to be on campus. Wamba and Yukeembruk are both more like half an hour\u2019s walk away, which makes a huge difference when you consider the walk back too. \n\nUnilodge is clean, everything works normally, and the maintenance team are regularly on hand in case something doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019ve got friends at both Wamba and Yukeembruk, but there\u2019s a reason this is where I stayed",

            "comment": "UniLodge (and by extension Yukeembruk &amp; Wamburun, since they\u2019re both managed by UniLodge, fun fact. The other two just aren\u2019t formally associated with the main 4 Lodges at a cultural level, bc they\u2019re far away and enjoy their Daley Rd independence. So expected the potentially bad service anywhere. Our reception level staff have always been great here at Lodge though), is a \u201cyou get what you put in out of it\u201d. There are regular events, formals &amp; balls, building dinners, common room hangouts, interhall arts &amp; sports, our own O Week/Bush week, cultural events, and so forth. All events are sent by email, so watch their so you don\u2019t miss anything. Good mix of domestic / international students, typically 50-50, as well as postgrads. \n\n\nLodge, whilst expensive, is better value for money than Yukeembruk. Here, if in a studio, you have your own rooms, bathroom, desk, bed etc. At Yukeembruk, you share everything that isn\u2019t the basics (cooking, bathrooms \ud83e\udd2e) with others. In multi shares at Lodge, you share with 5 others max and have two of everything (fridge, bathrooms, storage etc), so it\u2019s much better value for money even with a few more people. \n\nThe main thing I\u2019ve heard about Yukeembruk is that whilst it\u2019s establishing a really great early culture (currently winning interhall arts), it\u2019s super far away. Like very far. 30-40 minute walk to civic. Lodge is 10-15 max (walking pace dependent). So factor that in. \n\nI lived in Wambam for a bit, and it too, compared to Lodge, is far. Maybe 20-30 minutes from civic. Similar culture to Lodge-you get what you put in, a lot of international students. \n\nHope this helps a bit. You can always internally transfer if you\u2019re not happy with the situation.",

Wambam has shared bathrooms and let me tell you it was gross (we actually got banned from peeing in the shower-how were they going to find out who it was lol? Our floor agreed not to dob each other in lol)",

            "comment": "I currently live at Kinloch (this is my first sem) in a 3-shared. I myself was skeptical before moving here( I am an international student as well). So far from my experience I can tell you that Kinloch is clean, they give out a form at start that you need to fill and inform them if something doesn\u2019t work but I didn\u2019t face any such issue. People are nice and as for culture they do organise events and every floor has something of it\u2019s own going on. It\u2019s a maximum of 15 mins walk for everywhere. I personally feel good to have chosen this place. Plus there\u2019s a grocery store just outside where you can get stuff if you are in an emergency otherwise centre is not far.\nAs for fenner and Wamburun, my friends live there and I myself have been there. The rooms are decent sizes. Bathrooms are okay and kitchens are okay too. Depends if you are comfortable sharing a bathroom and open to cook with people around you. Fenner is at a good location but as for wamban it\u2019s really far. \nHope this helps!!\u263a\ufe0f",

            "comment": "I've visited Yukeembruk and stayed there for a weekend and the rooms are quite small, think desk, single bed and everything else is in a cupboard. There are shared bathrooms that are relatively clean though the floor is very wet. It is very far from literally everything else, if you don't have a car/don't want to pay to park it in the parking station it's not worth it in my opinion as it's kinda in the middle of nowhere. The shared kitchens, while new and well fitted out, are dirty as people don't really clean up after themselves properly (not a fault of the college themselves). The culture there is something else however, everyone I met was super friendly and they have frequent floor and college events which seem rlly fun. Yukeembruk is definitely on my preferences list, but I would rather stay somewhere closer to services such as the civic etc as my first choice :)",

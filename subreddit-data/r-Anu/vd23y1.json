    "postText": " Dear community fellows,\n\nI applied to a PhD program at the ANU (Australian National University). I received the offer letter **without** scholarship however I was being told that the outcome of the scholarship will be announced by early June.\n\nDespite being in the mid June, I didn't receive any notification and therefore I asked their admission department about the outcome recently. However, they said that the outcome is announced and for details I should contact my research applied school.\n\nI've written to the concerned school an email to obtain the outcome however their response takes at least a week and my offer letter deadline is very near.\n\nIn this regard, what should I perceive the outcome of the scholarship so that I'm mentally prepared for it? And how their scholarship selection procedure work?\n\nYour response is highly appreciated.",

I'd be pretty optimistic about getting one if i were you.   \n\n\nThe best way to know about the outcome would be to contact the college/school. For example, these guys are super responsive - https://science.anu.edu.au/contacts",

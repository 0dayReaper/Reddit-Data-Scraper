    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nI've recently received the early entry offer to the Bachelor of Visual Arts at ANU. Unfortunately, I couldn't find much information on the student experience in the course, and the information given on open day was not very detailed. Can anyone who has done or is doing this course let me know your overall experience and whether you would recommend it to someone who wants to find a career in the field of visual arts? \n\nThank you so much!",

In reality art schools are in crisis nationally and there are only really two or three worth going to on the east coast: ANU, VCA or NAS. \n\nBoth UNSW and USYD have absorbed their art schools into other faculties as a result of covid cost cutting. \n\nSo yeah, it is an excellent choice, plus the electives you can do from across ANU are pretty exceptional. The art scene in Canberra is small but supportive, as opposed to quite cut throat in Syd/Melb.",

Most courses are really interesting, and all of my teachers have been PhD or ex PhD students. They\u2019ve got some really interesting works and loads of different topics and mediums to explore. ANU has heaps of connections to art galleries and things, every week or two I get an email saying they are enlisting students to help with gallery exhibitions or street art or sculpture displays etc. so heaps of opportunities",

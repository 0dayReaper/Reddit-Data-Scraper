    "postText": "Hey all!\n\nI'm a current Year 12 VCE Student from Melbourne, Victoria. I'm planning on applying for early entry and had a few questions about the ranking system.\n\nmy subject averages are as follows (these subjects are the ones I'm also doing this year, not including subjects I've dropped):\n\nsem 1. japanese 88%\n             english 85%\n             methods 60%\n             physics 58%\n             global 83%\n\nsem 2. japanese 83%\n             english 83%\n             methods 50%\n             physics 66%\n             global politics 83%\n\ntotal japanese 85% A\n         english 84% B+\n         methods 55% D+\n         physics 62% C\n         global  politics 83% B+\n\nI really struggled with stage 4 lockdown and fell especially behind with maths and physics. would this be taken into consideration? I also go to a moderately scaled school with an average study score of 31. Would I be able to attain a predicted atar of 80 or over?\n\nMany thanks!",

    "postText": "Current PhD (first year) student here. I was in LK, Unilodge, in sem 1 but due to the whole COVID disruption I\u2019ve had to cancel my rent. I am currently in the process of going through the returner\u2019s application but it seems unlikely I\u2019ll get accepted again since I don\u2019t have coursework or a job on campus that gives me any urgency to return. However, I would like to return (at some point, just not urgent). So now I\u2019m thinking about applying to Grad House instead - I know it\u2019s usually very competitive and there\u2019s a long waitlist, but given the current situation I feel like I may get a chance? Anyone currently living at Grad House or have had experience applying there? Cheers!",

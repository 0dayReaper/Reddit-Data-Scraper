    "postText": "Currently in the Master of Computing (Coursework) program and in the Machine learning or computing foundation specialization. Going for research has always be my dream but I didn\u2019t choose the right major for my bachelor degree unfortunately. \n\nIt seems applying for a PhD is relevant area is really hard given this global circumstances, and I also don\u2019t have any research experience relating to this field. What I don\u2019t know now is that is it even possible for someone in my case to take a PhD in CS, and if yes, how can I get the research experience needed for further study from scratch? Can I rely on the research project in the course outline or should I look for my own?\n\nThanks a lot for any coming comments and help.",

You can also email professors and lecturers between semesters about research assistant work or volunteer yourself for some summer research projects for more research experience if you want. Whats more important is finding a good supervisor for your phd. The research experience is more to get past university admin in most cases.",

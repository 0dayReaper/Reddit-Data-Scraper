            "comment": "The [Bachelor of Advanced Computing](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2023/program/aacom) (BAC) is more research oriented than the [Bachelor of  Information Technology](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/bit) (BIT). BAC has an extra honours year where you have to complete a research project. So BAC is a 4 year degree and BIT is a 3 year degree. BAC has a slightly more restrictive course structure (i.e. more mandatory courses) and requires you to maintain a 70% course score average. \n\nMy suggestion: There are lots of ways to study CS at ANU. You need to decide what you are most interested it. If you are interested in doing CS research, BAC is probably better. Though, in this case, there are probably better degrees such as [BACRD](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/aacrd) and [PHB](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/aphsc). If you are not interested in research, BIT is better since it shorter and less restrictive. Alternatively, doing a [Bachelor of Science](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/bsc) with a [Computer Science Major](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/major/CSCI-MAJ) is another popular way of studying CS since it provides a lot of course freedom. \n\nHope this help!",

    "postText": "Hi, \nI am a year 12 student applying for early entry.\n\nI was wondering what the conditions on  a conditional offers are like for HSC year 12 students. \n\nDo they:\n- just require HSC completion\n- achieve a certain ATAR? If so is the ATAR higher or lower than the advertised selection rank?\n- or some other condition\n\nAsking cus I\u2019m not confident with exams at all and don\u2019t think i can meet the advertised selection rank, hence the early application.",

Not really seeing the difference between a normal entry apart from getting a reserved spot if i meet the requirements.",

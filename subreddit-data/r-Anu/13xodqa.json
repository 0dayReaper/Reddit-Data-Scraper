    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI'm 22 and am looking at undertaking my second undergrad and currently checking out different unis. At the moment I am picking between ANU and UWA. I'm hesitant to go to ANU because whenever I talk to people about it they seem to indicate it has a very dull student life and next to no social stuff in Canberra. However, I wanted to know what current and past students on this sub think, is ANU as tame as a goldfish or is there social shenanigans to be had?\n\nYour time is appreciated.",

Within a hall there are many social shenanigans to be had, both proper events and random things with friends. Depending on the societies you\u2019re interested in there will also be the opportunity for frequent events there.",

ANU is appealing because I could do 4 majors tied to a career in Environmental Science OR focus and become a specialist in intel and counter-terrorism",

If you are looking for the most affordable option bng is the cheapest in terms of fees and has a very active culture(debatably the most) but is self catered, not necessarily a con but for some it is. I\u2019d steer away from lodges as they are more independent living and lose a lot of the social aspect.",

I'm hoping to get a catered experience because my ADHD means I don't look after myself properly, if it comes down to me cooking, I just won't eat....",

Don\u2019t know anyone there personally, but it doesn\u2019t seem like Christianity is a big part of staying there (honestly it\u2019s more known for its partying). If you let the university know about your need for catering due to medical reasons then I think that helps with getting into Bruce or Wright which are catered and flexi catered respectively, but they\u2019re a bit pricier. I think Ursula is catered too actually?",

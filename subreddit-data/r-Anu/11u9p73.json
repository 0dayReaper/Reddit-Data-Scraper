            "comment": "ANU has something called the first year guarantee - which basically means you\u2019re guaranteed to get a spot at one of the colleges. It however doesn\u2019t guarantee your preference (so keep that in mind). Privately run colleges like Burg and John\u2019s have interview/application stages - so it would be a good idea to have extracurriculars (or anything that can boost ur \u201cCV\u201d ahead of others). hope this helps!\n\n[first year guarantee link](https://www.anu.edu.au/study/accommodation/accommodation-application-advice/accommodation-guarantee-at-anu)",

No one cares once you\u2019re in.",

            "comment": "I think it\u2019s important to reflect on why some selective UNIs encourage extracurricular activities. Your education in only one part of the university experience. \n\nThey normally want to know that you will be an active participant in the community and culture of the university (in a positive way). They encourage extracurricular activities that reinforce their values. It\u2019s often the non core degree education that will define your vocation and where your passions are. \n\nI would suggest don\u2019t do something just so it looks good on a CV. You will probably join a UNI or company that expects you to live that lie for the rest of your life. Do what you enjoy and then you will always be able to be yourself. Always a difficult thing during this instagram generation of perfection.",

            "comment": "It depends upon the faculty in which you intend to enroll. Entry is based on an \u2018ATAR\u2019 score - Australian Tertiary Admission Rank. This seeks to standardize examination and assessment results of final year high school students. I am not exactly certain how it is calculated but it is based on percentiles. For example, if you scored 95 then you would have scored more highly than 95% of the cohort of year 12 high school graduates.\n\nThe largest faculty at ANU is the Faculty of Arts. The minimum ATAR for entry is usually 80. The other smaller faculties typically have higher ATARS - Mathematical Science for example is at least 95.\n\nUniversities in Australia do not normally publish \u2018acceptance rates\u2019 as such, just the minimum rank required to gain entry into a given faculty. There are other pathways into universities, including ANU, other than ATAR score, (although comparatively few places compared with the conventional method). These could include mature-age entry, various diploma and associate degree courses held already by the applicant, disadvantaged students who do not meet the normal entry requirements and relevant work experience.\n\nI hope this assists.",

Your one preference will be taken into account and then factors like degree, year of study, place that you\u2019re from, high school, etc will be utilised to sort students in a way that means each residence will have diversity amongst its residents. There is a first year guarantee, so you will be offered something, even if it\u2019s not your preference.",

    "postText": "Hey all!   \nIt has been a while since I've shared the invite link for the unofficial ANU Students Discord Server.    \nThe server is a place where students can be comfortable asking for and getting immediate help from others. \n\nIf you have questions of any kind we will do our best to answer them or point you to the right ANU resources. We're an active community who enjoy putting in our time to not only create an informative and supportive environment but also a great way to meet others and form lasting relationships.    \n[Feel free to join us by following this invite link.](https://discord.gg/GwtFCap)    \n\n\nI also just want to put out a big congratulations to everyone who received an offer to study at ANU in 2020.",

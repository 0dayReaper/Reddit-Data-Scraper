    "postText": "Hi, was just wondering if anyone with experience in these areas could share some advice or personal opinion on the differences/pros and cons of these two bachelor degrees. It is to be paired with law. I've loved economics at school, but always thought commerce was a more diverse and just solid degree to do. Now I'm starting to think I should study eco further - also from what I've read seems like ANU is more known/better for economics, compared to commerce...is this correct? Any/all advice appreciated!! thanks",

            "comment": "So with commerce you major in a specific business area including accounting, business information systems, management, marketing, corporate sustainability, economics, finance or international business. If you were to do a commerce degree and decided to major in economics, your education wouldn't be that far behind if you had just done a standalone economics degree. The difference between doing a major in eco (commerce) or doing an eco degree is that these courses are not compulsory for the commerce degree:\n\n* EMET1001 Foundations of Economic and Financial Models\n* EMET2007 Econometrics I: Econometric Methods\n\nThere's also a difference in the choice of electives you can do and commerce includes the baseline compulsory units of business reporting and analysis, management, etc. \n\nSo when choosing between a commerce degree majoring in eco or doing an eco degree, you're choosing whether or not you want to be quite educated in economics with some level of proficiency in other business units or if you want to be almost entirely focused on just the economics part of your degree. \n\nYou could also choose to not do an eco major at all as part of your commerce degree in which Macro 1 and Micro 1 would be your only compulsory economics units (a major is a compulsory part of the commerce degree so you would still need to major in finance, management, information systems, etc). \n\nYou can compare the two courses with their degree pages:\n\n[Bachelor of Economics](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/BECON)\n\n[Economics Major](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/major/ECST-MAJ)\n\n[Bachelor of Commerce](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/BCOMM)\n\nIt really depends on what you would like to do. Commerce offers more diversification. Honestly a combo of eco or commerce with law both looks amazing, so just base it off what you think you'll enjoy! :)",

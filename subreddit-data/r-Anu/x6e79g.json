    "postText": "I have accepted an offer to study flexible double law starting next year. I have also been offered my preferred accomodation at Lena Karmel. My initial inclination would be to live off campus (I am an introvert who needs occasional silence), however I have two concerns regarding this:\n\n1. is it hard to make friends/meet new people if you don't live on campus? are there any significant things that off-campus students 'miss out' on? I am moving interstate from QLD so won't necessarily have many existing friends near me. \n2. a bit of googling has revealed some people complaining about parking on campus - staff only parking in main areas? generally difficult to find spaces?... are these complaints valid?\n\nWould really appreciate some advice :)  \nThanks!",

To me Unilodge just feels like living in an apartment complex, so you\u2019ll occasionally hear people talking in the hallway for a couple minutes but no loud shouting / music / party behaviour. \n\nWell I think that if you live on-campus you\u2019ll obviously have the advantage of being able to access events organised by your college / hall. In my opinion thats the big difference between living on/off campus, cause other ways to make friends (such as classes, clubs, sport etc.) can all be done if you live off-campus.",

Personally I didn\u2019t find it that bad, most of the time it was quite clean and over time you\u2019ll know when its quieter so you can be the only one using the showers etc. Although I have heard some weird stories from friends at other halls about shared bathrooms haha",

If you don't have that group of friends or hobbies that might allow you to meet people, and no drinking doesn't count, then you might become isolated. There are a bunch of clubs that you can attend to meet people on campus so that can mitigate that.\n\nIf you do end up living off campus I would recommend somewhere that is walking distance or cycling distance. I'm close enough to do both and it's fantastic as driving around ANU and the city is really bad and I would recommend against it.",

    "postText": "Looking on the ANU website, it seems that there's quite a lot of overlap and similarities between these two degrees and I'm not sure which one to choose. I'm wondering if there's anyone who studies either degree and could tell me what the key differences between the two are? (and if one's more worth doing than the other!)\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Hello OP,\n\nI'm currently doing Law/Security flexible double and find it amazing (still in first year). From what I've heard from people doing IR, BINSS is a bit more hands on, practical based, with an emphasis on conflict studies, whereas IR is a lot more focused on their general interactions, including trade, environmental policy, human rights etc. (but of course, that's a general description, you're going to end up doing both things in each course). \\\\ In terms of employability prospects, I'm not sure. BINSS is a very popular degree, but I'm 100% sure you'll enjoy IR as well if you choose it. I also recommend doing a double.",

As the above says, think of IR being more theory based compared to IS as more practical and relevant (one of the reasons why I chose it over IR) as you study the things that are happening *now*.",

            "comment": "International Relations is the parent field and is generally considered to be constituted by two major sub fields: international security studies and international political economy. I did an IR undergrad and am currently a graduate student in a major UK security studies program. IR will be a broader overview of the field and will include the duality of conflict and cooperation that underpin international relations. My only caveat would be that you may find interest areas of IR outside of ISS to be of interest and it may compliment your later work in ISS by offering a more holistic perspective of the instruments of statecraft and international issues. You can always gravitate your undergrad research toward ISS and do a more specialized path if you decide to do graduate studies. Happy to elaborate if you would like and good luck in your studies!",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm from Melbourne, and I plan to start post-grad study at ANU in 2021. \n\nUnfortunately, because of COVID, I'm unable to go to the uni and see the post-grad accom options in person. So I'm posting here in hopes that some of you may be able to give me some advice. \n\nI'd love to stay on campus and choose an accom option that will allow me to socialise, since I will be moving to Canberra alone. However, I'd still like to have some of my own space. \n\nWhat are people's experiences with post-grad on-campus accom? Are there any halls or colleges that people recommend?  If so, why? \n\nThanks in advance :)",

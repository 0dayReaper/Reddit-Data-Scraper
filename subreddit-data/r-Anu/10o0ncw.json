Overall Canberra doesn't have a huge indonesian community but there would be lots of muslim communities and halal butcheries etc if that is something you are concerned about (also there is a large Malaysian community). Also unrelated but I plan on learning Indonesian over the next few years and I'm sure there are a ton of other people interested in the culture.",

This was all in year 12 so some things may have changed but as far as I know there were a few Indonesians I talked to who plan on going into ANU. They were all very smart so I\u2019m sure they would\u2019ve made it in. I suppose I\u2019ll find out and get in contact with them once everything gets started.",

            "comment": "It can be tempting as a 4th year to rag on the ANU as a jaded uni student, but honestly it's been a real privilege and special experience coming to uni here. A beautiful and busy campus, great new facilities (i.e. the CBE, Hana Neumann building etc) and really passionate lecturers has been amazing. I don't think any other Go8 has the same culture/opportunities of student life. I wouldn't want to transfer anywhere else. Also depending on what you study, you can get a major headstart on your career by starting in specialised roles in Govt or consultancy where there is slightly less competition as other cities but pays better!",

I have felt very privileged to study at ANU in my undergrad and have access to one of the best research universities in my postgrad. Because ANU is a research university most of your lecturers will be conducting their own research so you are  (at least in science) generally learning about the newest advances in the field and hearing about current research that is happening. Because of this is it also super easy to make connections with researchers for great opportunities in undergrad (I was paid to go to far North Queensland for two weeks in my undergrad as a research assistant) and my PhD supervisor was one of my undergrad lecturers.",

But the real opportunities are in postgraduate at ANU, so a lot of students don't see all the benefits.\n\nMost of the colleges enable good opportunities if you're interested in a research career or postgrad degree (though high costs come into play).\n\nDefinitely a pristine campus and location - a lot of universities can't say the same.",

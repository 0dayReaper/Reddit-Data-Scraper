    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m currently completing my application for first semester 2023. I was wondering if anyone could give insight into how the accomodation application process works? As in, if I preference a hall (say, Bruce or Wright) on what basis will my application be assessed, how likely am I to get my first preference and, if I don\u2019t, will I haven\u2019t able to register a second preference?\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to find some details on the anu website but I\u2019ve not had luck. Any help would be much appreciated!",

    "postText": "I've done STAT1008 which was easy because it was just high school revision. I want to know how big of a jump there is in difficulty for later stat courses. Does it just immediately throw you in the deep end or is it a gradual increase in difficulty?\n\nThe ATAR requirement for Bstats is 80 which is the min for ANU, so I am hoping it will be gradual? What were your experiences?",

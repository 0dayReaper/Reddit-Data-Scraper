    "postText": "I am a prospective student at ANU\u2026. I was just wondering what your thoughts on the psychology courses they offer (undergrad).\n\nWhat are the professors like?\nWhat is the content like? Is it very science/ math and research oriented? Is it interesting/ enjoyable?\nWhat is the workload like?\nIs it extremely competitive?\n\nWould you recommend doing a double degree with a bachelor of science (psych) and something else or is just going straight for a bachelor of psychology (honours) better? \n\nI would hope to do an honours year either way, but i\u2019m just interested in some current student\u2019s perspectives.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Hi there! Late response but I hope this still helps. I am a current ANU science student and I took psychology for the first year and a half of my degree. From my experience the psychology courses are really great. The courses in first year start out pretty broad to get everyone to the same level of understanding and start to get more specific from there. Psychology in general is not very math oriented, but it is a science so you will be learning about experiments and research, and you will probably be asked to take part in research for participation in your course. Most professors lecturing at ANU are researchers themselves so they often can give super fascinating insight into the most recent developments in psychology, and are really wonderful to talk to. I had some really great research opportunities come out of talking to my professors. There is generally nothing an ANU professor loves more than students interested in their research! I found the work load very comparable to other science courses, 3 lecture hours, a few contact hours for tutorials etc and assignments. First year is generally pretty hand on in any course to make sure you have all the support you need to do well in the course! i really can't comment on the honours question. My best advice would be to talk to someone at ANU science to chat about your future and your interests. The biggest thing to consider would be if you want to study anything else while you are at ANU. Hope this helps! send me a message if you have any other questions.",

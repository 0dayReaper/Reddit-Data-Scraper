    "postText": "Note: I posted the same question to the Unimelb subreddit so that both sides can offer their perspectives.\n\nOriginal post:\n\nI apologise in advance for the wall of text, but this is an issue that is genuinely plaguing me and I don\u2019t know how to bring it up with my parents without upsetting them.\n\nIf I were to study at unimelb, it would be a Bachelor of Science with a major in Computing and Software systems, and for ANU I\u2019ve already gained early entry into a Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Honours).\n\nMy dilemma is basically this: along with gaining early entry into ANU, I have been offered a huge $40,000 scholarship which will play a major role in easing the financial burden, especially as I\u2019m a regional student and live in a lower-middle income household. However, I can\u2019t help but desire to instead go to Melbourne Uni. I\u2019m likely to get a 90-95 ATAR and get into the course, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m going to get a scholarship (or if I do, I don\u2019t know if it will come close to the value of the ANU one).\n\nMelbourne is simply a city with more opportunities in both my career and social life than Canberra. It is also a bit more prestigious than ANU (obviously not by a large margin) and I\u2019ve heard that their science and engineering areas are comparatively better. I would also have more high school friends in Melbourne compared to Canberra, where my social circle would literally be reset to 0. And for the degree itself, I kind of like the emphasis on broad study before honing in on a specialisation as offered by the Bachelor of Science. And then there are electives for ANU and breadth subjects for Melbourne uni. If anyone has knowledge of these, how do they compare (do they function in a similar way and offer a similar range/variety)? \n\nMy parents are thrilled that I made it into ANU with the scholarship, but if I tell them that I\u2019m considering giving up that scholarship to go to Melbourne Uni I honestly don\u2019t think they\u2019ll take it well. So, taking into account all these factors, should I stick with the safe option and study at ANU or should I follow my gut feeling and go to Melbourne instead? \n\nThank you all in advance",

A lot of students at ANU start from zero in this regard. You can still always stay in touch and catch up, as you should - it is what I do. Also not sure if Melbourne is more prestigious, depends on what metric you're using.\n\nIf I were you I would wait to see what sort of scholarship you get from Melbourne, especially if Melbourne is better career wise for you.",

However, ANU has made a significant effort to retain the classic campus experience which was common in the later 20th century at most universities - a very lively and involved student body. This great student body experience is largely due to ANU\u2019s colleges which line Daley Road. As a result, if you opt to go to ANU and go to one of the on campus colleges (Bruce, wright, Burgmann, John\u2019s, Ursula, etc) then I highly recommend ANU. You will very quickly meet friends if you do so and you will be living amongst hundreds of students in your age group. These colleges have a deep history, many fun traditions and an extremely strong social element. In turn, you should not worry about having no friends in Canberra if you attend one of these places, I would recommend Burgmann and Bruce at the more expensive end and bng and fennar if you are looking for somewhere cheaper. I would not recommend coming to Canberra if you were not considering going to one of these colleges as your experience would be vastly different. It is noteworthy that extroverts flourish in the college environment but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be one to enjoy your time there, I like to think of myself as a half extrovert and half introvert. It is noteworthy that your experience can depend on the college you go to. If you want more info on colleges lmk and I can give you some greater perspective.",

            "comment": "Congratulations on your scholarship, I'm really happy for you.\n\nReading your post, I think that your mind is already made up about UniMelb, which is fine - it's a great university. The $40,000 scholarship is certainly something to take into account, although you are right that Melbourne has more opportunities in your field of interest. I would say UniMelb might be the best choice for you if we exclude the ANU scholarship - as u/FinanceFormer3954 said, wait and see what scholarships you can get from Melbourne.\n\nI am not a STEM student, so I don't know how things work at CECS but if you feel that the ANU degree that you chose is a bit too specific, see if you can transfer your scholarship to another degree that you might like and that is broader.\n\nANU and UniMelb also offer cross-institutional study. You'll definitely have to research that, but if you see courses that you like at UniMelb that don't have an equivalent at ANU or vice-versa, you can apply to do a sort of exchange that lets you complete those courses at the other university and make them count towards your degree.\n\nEdit: while there is a financial burden, keep in mind that if you are a domestic student you will be able to put part (or all) of your student fees on HECS/HELP. I had the same concerns as you and while you will obviously have to pay someday, you at least won't have to pay upfront.\n\nMoving to Canberra now doesn't mean that you have to stay there for the rest of your life either. Many people come to study and then move somewhere else in Australia or internationally to do a postgrad or enter the workforce. \n\nDoes your scholarship include accommodation on campus?",

            "comment": "As someone who studied at UniMelb (on full scholarship) and now ANU (part-time hobby as an older person), I think the impact of having financial aid is huger than you can realise. You'll be able to focus more time on both studying and your student social life, knowing that your primary focus isn't working to earn $$ to pay for your uni life. Years down the track, not having a HECS debt means you'll be able to afford a property earlier. ANU CS is internationally recognised (FAANG hires have come from ANU). Also, as a Unimelb student, it depends on which circle of friends you find but participating in social activities that are expensy (without scholarship support) will need budgeting for. For that, a lot of my uni friends had rich parents and thankfully I had my scholarship. \n\nAs someone else said, studying in one uni doesn't lock you down for life. If you do great, you'll be able to move anywhere for opportunities.",

You also won't find it difficult to find friends so long as you either start in a good college or go out and find them. Joining some societies is an easy way to quickly gain some friendships. \n\nI found myself in a similar situation to you, where I kind of just wanted to stay in Tasmania and go to UTAS, but found myself with a massive scholarship. And while maybe without it, I would prefer to be studying in Tasmania, you really don't understand how much impact having that money has while you're studying until you're a few months in and feeling secure while others around you are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nAs mentioned, I'm from Tasmania, and so obviously I don't share your problem with losing opportunities in careers and social life. But I think that Canberra still has plenty of opportunity for whatever pathway you want, and it certainly still has plenty of opportunities to socialize, whether it be bars, nightclubs or societies. Honestly, coming from such a small state, Canberra is a nice in-between of not being overwhelmingly large like Melbourne, but still large enough to be relevant and have all the services you need. Just beware that all fast food places shut on the weekend except Maccas for some reason.",

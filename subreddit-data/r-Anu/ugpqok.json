    "postText": "I applied to ANU for a master on the first of April normally according to their website the offer shall be released on 1 May if I apply before 14 April. However, I have only received their preliminary assessment result and which was sent to me a few days ago, like it takes a whole month to just have an assessment result. But I also saw some people have already had an offer on 1 May...\n\nI wonder why it's so slow lol.... does that mean I have to wait for another month for the result?",

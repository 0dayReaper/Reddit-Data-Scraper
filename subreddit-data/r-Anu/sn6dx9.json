    "postText": "Hello ANU Hive Mind!\n\nI am starting a B Science (Psych) with the aim of resetting my GPA, sitting the GAMSAT, and entering postgrad med.\n\nIt's been ten years since I completed my undergrad (2012) and I am understandably excited and nervous. \n\nI'm doing the following units. If anyone has any wisdom or advice about them, I'd be hugely grateful! Particularly given I'm super focused on the GPA to get into med, but also want to do units I'm interested in (hence the two Philosophy ones). That said, if you have advice about any other units that are worth checking out and potentially changing into, I'd be very glad to receive your perspective!\n\nMy units (for the moment) are:\n\n* PSYC1003 - Psychology 1: Understanding Mind, Brain and Behaviour. (Compulsory)\n* HLTH1001 - Health in the 21st Century. (1000 level Science elective)\n* PHIL1004 - Fundamental Ideas in Philosophy: An Introduction. (Sci or non-Sci elective)\n* PHIL1008 - Introduction to Ethics. (Sci or non-Sci elective)\n\nThanks again :)",

I am a current ANU PhD student but in my undergrad I majored in science communication at ANU and found that most of those classes are not only relatively easy if you have an interest in English but also incredibly fun and can be a fantastic break from your more content heavy classes. They are also really interesting, you can tailor the content you cover to suit your own interests and you learn a lot as a bonus! Feel free to send me a message if you want to chat!",

            "comment": "Hey there - I'm not a psych/med student so I can't weigh in on that but I do PPE with a heavy Phil focus. In my view you might want to pick either 1004 OR 1008 - they're both pretty introductory. In PPE you can only pick one or the other because they give you enough of the fundamentals to jump into some other Phil course. I did 1008 in 2019 and really enjoyed it (I personally don't really enjoy continental philosophy that much) but my friends who took 1004 also enjoyed it! I think if you wanted an easy first-year course with something to take away from it I could reccomend PHIL1005 (which runs in sem2) whcih is easy to HD but still pretty engaging :)",

I was reflecting on that the last few days - it might be better to have 1004 or 1008 AND 1005 up my sleeve for 3rd year (GPA weightings for postgrad med increase, so 3rd year is quite important - having these handy for then might be a better go.)\n\nRelated - if anyone has any units they know are enjoyable/have had positive experiences with, do include them below! Thanks again!",

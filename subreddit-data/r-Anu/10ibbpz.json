This might sound very confusing so I'll try to be as clear as I can with what I'm asking but, I am doing two majors and there is a class that I am enrolled in that counts toward both of them. So, I was wondering that, if by completing this class, it counts toward BOTH majors, or only one?\n\nFor context, it is \"HIST2110 Approaches to History\" which counts towards  a History major, AND an Ancient History major, both of which I am currently doing.",

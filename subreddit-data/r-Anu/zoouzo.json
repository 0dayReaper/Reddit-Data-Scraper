    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI received an early offer into flexible double law back in September and I\u2019m aware that my application will be reassessed now that my ATAR is out. I\u2019ve scored more than enough to get into the course, but given I\u2019m a QCE student I was wondering if I have to provide the university with it? Or do they already have access to it?\n\nThanks very much for your help, and looking forward to getting this journey started!",

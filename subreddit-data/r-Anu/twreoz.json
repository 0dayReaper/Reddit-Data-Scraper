It looks like ANU does accept TPC [https://www.anu.edu.au/study/apply/preparatory-bridging-courses](https://www.anu.edu.au/study/apply/preparatory-bridging-courses) but it is not clear what age that is for. The website I have linked has instructions to get in touch with the admissions team to find out if your specific circumstance is accepted. Hope this helps!",

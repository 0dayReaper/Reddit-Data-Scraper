So if more people apply for master of finance, it would make it harder to get in. I have only credit average as well and applied master of astronomy (5.0/7.0), was admitted but ended up staying with masters at Unimelb. I think if you have something like 60 ish, there is a chance you will get admitted for 5.0/7.0 masters. If you have 70, then I can say you\u2019re pretty safe. Even if you won\u2019t, which is unlikely, there are still lots of pathway and opportunities to start your career in finance, it\u2019s not end of the world. Best of luck, OP.",

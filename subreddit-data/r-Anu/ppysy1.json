            "comment": "Hey,\n\nI had also managed to get an early entry offer through the direct entry and am heaps excited for next year. I am planning on doing courses in neuroscience with a bit of immunology if I can.\n\nIf you havent seen this guide for the students a couple years ago ([https://science.anu.edu.au/files/anu-science-phb-hitchikers-guide-2020.pdf](https://science.anu.edu.au/files/anu-science-phb-hitchikers-guide-2020.pdf)) I'd recommend running through it cause I still barely have an idea of what an ASC or ASE is and a bunch of the stuff with PhB is complicated. Just if you don't know, you don't actually have to pick a major or minor for PhB, and from what I know you really just pick particular courses so you don't have to restrict yourself just to the ones under the Psych major. I know that I'll probs do PSYC1003 and PSYC1004 for first year cause there aren't really any neuroscience first year courses, but then won't really be doing any psych for the other years.\n\nIt'll be really sick to see if there are any gatherings that all of the PhB students go to some time next year so we can meet everyone and make new friends from all around the country. There are a few other people who also got into PhB through direct entry if you go back about a month ago in the posts.\n\nHopefully all the COVID stuff is dealt with by the time we start our first year cause I know it's been really trash (especially since I'm from NSW) so we really can take advantage of meeting new people, doing physical classes, and doing all the research oppurtunities we can.\n\nNext year is gonna be great and can't wait to meet you.",

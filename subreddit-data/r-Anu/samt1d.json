    "postText": "I'm a new student this year and am planing to ride in to campus most days since it's quite convenient. However, my friend insists that bikes are often stolen or parts are taken, especially if you have a similar routine (e.g. locking up in the same location each day). Is it that bad? Do you definitely need multiple U-locks? Or is it mostly fine as long as you don't leave your bike unlocked in some alleyway.\n\nThanks for any help!",

Other than that, I\u2019ve seen bikes locked up that were missing tires, while other friends have had their bikes stolen while they were in class. Would definitely invest in a good bike chain, a proper lock, and to check on it frequently if you do get one.",

It\u2019s not uncommon to see stolen bike posts on stalkerspace and it\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m personally uncomfortable with riding my ebike on-campus. Would defiantly recommend you buy a strong U-lock and keep photos of your bike and record details including serial number, make and model of the bike. \n\nHere\u2019s a map of ANU\u2019s bike enclosures: https://imagedepot.anu.edu.au/fs/Parking/Bike_map.pdf",

It does not change the underlying problem but it should act as a deterrence. In my experience whenever I used the college specific bike cages I never had any issues. If riding to ANU I would park it closest to Kambri as it would have the most foot traffic during the day. Hope this helps.",

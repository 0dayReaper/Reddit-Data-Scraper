Will anyone check/catch me if I do stay in NZ?\n\nIf any kiwis are out the please let me know what you're doing :)",

From my understanding, the USI(\u2018unique student identifier) is what is needed on the commonwealth form to be able to get CSP (common wealth support place-which is the tuition subsidy). Now, because we are overseas NZers, we can\u2019t apply for a USI directly. Nor can we enroll in classes without the USI. So I think the USI is the key to be able to enroll in courses and pay domestic fees... I already contacted ANU to ask if they\u2019d be able to help us with getting a USI, the representative said that multiple colleges are contacting the government abt allowing for us to get a USI. I\u2019d encourage you to call ANU about this too, so there are more voices to get the ball rolling. \n\nSorry this isn\u2019t a solution, but as far as I know, this is the closest we are to one atm- basically putting all my hope in that the government will allow ANU to get overseas kiwis our USIs.",

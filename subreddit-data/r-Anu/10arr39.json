    "postText": "Hi, I had received my offer in late December and accepted it before January, around the 29th. May I ask as to why I have not gotten my Certificate of Eligibility yet? I am applying for an Australian Student Visa from Malaysia and I fear that it would take weeks and I am not even able to apply now. My education consultant has assured me that I will be in time for classes but I will definitely miss the orientation week. It has been more than 2 weeks since I have made the initial payment to ANU when accepting the offer.",

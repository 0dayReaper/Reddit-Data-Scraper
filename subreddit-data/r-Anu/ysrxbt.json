    "postText": "I received an early offer to study at the ANU and was accepted into my accommodation preference of B and G. However, I have not received any follow-up emails regarding my accommodation.  The acceptance letter just said to accept all forms of my offer which I did. Was just wondering if I missed something in regard to my accommodation. Any info would be helpful",

I also got an offer for next year, though the email said that their accommodation portal was broken and when they fix it we will be able to accept the offer. I suspect that is what is happening with you too but it is strange they didn't mention anything about it",

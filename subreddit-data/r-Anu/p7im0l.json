    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI was wondering if it is easy to defer entry at ANU as you need to provide a reason. My main reason is to gain funds for accomodation. But I also want to let this pandemic settle for a bit (if it does settle). \n\nTo anyone that has deferred entry, was it a easy process? Where any reasons not accepted? And is gaining funds for accomodation a good reason? And what are some good reasons? Lol",

The only thing is that scholarships often (if not always) require you to start straight out of school, so it would put you out of the running for those. And if u had accomodation guaranteed as part of ur early entry (for example a spot at Ursula Hall), u lose that spot when u come back that next year.",

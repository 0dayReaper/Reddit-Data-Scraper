I'm a year 12 domestic student looking to study IR/INSS at ANU next year, but I'm completely stumped with the accommodation portion of the application process - I've narrowed it down to the three in the title, but I was wondering if y'all could help me out with actual perspectives of living in any of the above, instead of just relying on google reviews.\n\nFrom what I've heard, LK is not as community focused, and unilodge is hella dodgy, but a multishare looks really cheap and I like the idea of having your own room but sharing the dorm with a few other people, as well as being quite close to city centre.\n\nWamba (on google maps) looks really isolated from the rest of campus but everyone seems to really like it, it seems like a tightknit community, looks good from reviews and seems pretty chill (also cheaper).\n\nFenner looks really good, in the middle of campus, good reviews etc etc. but it's not covered by NRAS.\n\nedit: how's the wifi + reception there?\n\nif anyone has any advice whatsoever that would be really good :))",

            "comment": "Wamba or Fenner gets my nod, avoid unilodge your first year of you can. Wamba looks more isolated than it is, you can get around pretty easily from there. Wamba really likes to party so if that\u2019s your vibe you\u2019ll be a bit more at home there than fenner. Fenner is the best on campus location wise, you\u2019re literally in the middle of it all (and less than a minute away from Kebaba!), but this can also be a downside as the noise can get pretty bad, especially when the crowds from civic are coming home thurs/fri/sat. Some have also reported that living so close to the lecture halls makes their academics feel literally inescapable.\n\nI cannot stress this enough, don\u2019t go to unilodge in your first year if you value an active social life or need to be around people. LK is technically in the city, but both your classes and shops at civic/Canberra Centre will be just far enough to make it an inconvenient and frustrating walk. If you want to keep your head down and study, and maybe brush up on your Chinese, it\u2019s really good for that. A lot of people get a lot of value from their time at lodge, and a lot of people wish they could leave but can\u2019t. It depends on what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nSome more general advice: there\u2019s a grocery store/convenience store hybrid on campus in Kambri and a SPAR not far from that, but their selection is minimal and the pricing is not that good. You\u2019re better off shopping at the ALDI/Coles in Canberra Centre. It\u2019s a 20-30 minute walk from campus and a total investment of 1.5-2 hours, but you\u2019ll save a lot of money. Once I had a group of mates at residence we all went to the shops together every few days, and it made a really fun group outing. Those memories are still some of my favorites to this day. Definitely check out the discount store across from the ALDI with some mates, it\u2019s surprisingly fun to go through and just look at all the random things they sell. ALDI spirits are indistinguishable from the more expensive stuff and ALDI wine cannot be beat, but surprisingly the Daily Market in Kambri is the best value for beer and sometimes spirits too. It\u2019s a little more expensive than the prices in civic, but it beats going there and back for a 6 pack. It\u2019s also shockingly easy (and legal) to brew your own wine/cider at home, which can be a great cheap rabbit hole to go down when you want to avoid doing coursework. When you get to college ask some of the 2nd or 3rd year students how they eat on the cheap, I learned some fun tricks this way and cut down my food bill by a good amount. Hope this helps!",

            "comment": "So I don\u2019t go to either but I am a domestic student living at one of the other self catered colleges up on Daley Road (Wright hall). From what you\u2019ve said and from what I know, in regards to LK, the social college aspect is what you make out of it. Granted it\u2019s not \u201cconnected\u201d to the rest of the uni like the other colleges are but I do have some mates whos in LK who are having a good time. Socialisation may be harder here then at a residential college but yet again that\u2019s up to who you are as a person. \n\nFenner is a really good self catered college, s you mentioned in the heart of campus so that\u2019s helpful too and the buildings in its 2nd year of operation, however, the culture there is amazing and i\u2019ve heard nothing but good things about it. \n\nWamburun is also a fantastic college, great facilities good people and great culture (from what i\u2019ve heard). Just because it\u2019s on the far end of the uni doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s isolated tho!! You shouldn\u2019t let that worry you as most of the people you\u2019ll be spending time with would be within your college, and you\u2019re not far from any of the other colleges at all!! \n\nI hope this helps and wasn\u2019t too vague, feel free to ask if you have any other questions!! In regards to money, if you are paying/supporting yourself without your parents, talk to centrelink and have a look at Youth Allowance. I know a handful of people who are dependent (don\u2019t get money from their parents for rent), and are able to live at self catered colleges from the payments they get.",

            "comment": "Wamburun is actually in a great spot on Daley Rd right amongst all the other colleges and everything on campus is a quick walk or bike ride from everywhere, so I wouldn't be worried about it being isolated. For Fenner I think it depends which way you're facing for the noise but I haven't really had any issues. Lots of false fire alarms though, you'll semi-regularly be woken up in the middle of the night and have to evacuate.\n\nI'd definitely say Wamburun's rooms are better value than Fenner - for the same price (NRAS doesn't really make a difference as they both come out to the same $295/wk at least this year) you get a double bed, TV and fridge. Fenner has hot water in the sink in your room but Wamburun doesn't, you have to go out into the hall to get hot water which is odd. The showers are better at Wamba because they're in separate sealed off rooms, whereas in Fenner they're just cubicles next to the toilets, kinda like at a community pool? But both get cleaned regularly and are usually not too gross.\n\nI think culture-wise, Fenner is the best in terms of a really kind, wholesome and inclusive community - its motto is \"Fenner looks after Fenner\" and all of the leadership are really lovely. I think Wamba is tight-knit and just as social but in a different, maybe more party-y way (not to say that Fenner doesn't also like to party, I think if you're into that you can definitely get it at both, and Fenner runs super cheap bar nights).\n\nWifi at both is pretty good! I've found it to be pretty much the same at either, sometimes it gets really slow for some reason but most of the time it's good and I wouldn't say you can really differentiate the two halls from what I've experienced.\n\nI haven't lived at LK so I can't speak for it but I think personally sharing a kitchen and bathroom in multi-share and trying to negotiate the responsibility of cleaning + maintaining it, and being in each other's space all the time could go fine or could go very bad. I think socially its better to just use the communal spaces at Wamba and Fenner, which pretty much always have people in them to chat to anyway! And you can do it on your own schedule.",

            "comment": "Hi. I lived in a single studio room at LK for 6 months. There is a Spar and an Asian supermarket both a short walk from LK. There is also a half-Asian/half-Western supermarket on campus, which is obviously close to LK. All these places are a little more expensive than Coles, though. \n\nYou know what, most people in this thread have already adequately described unilodge. I'd just like to point out, however, that unilodge is not 'hella dodgy', at least LK isn't (I'm assuming you got that from the google reviews?). The rooms are all well maintained, if you need maintenance just report it to reception and the handymen will be around in a couple of days to fix everything. I found the staff very friendly and helpful. There's a free gym there too, with cardio and resistance equipment. I don't believe your other options offer this. \n\nAltogether though it might be better to choice Wamba or Fenner just because there will be far more Aussies there. LK is mostly international students, who you can still socialise with ofc, but yeah, up to you.",

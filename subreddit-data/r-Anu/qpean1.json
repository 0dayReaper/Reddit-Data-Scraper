    "postText": "Hi ! I am writing this post on behalf of my boyfriend, who is considering moving over East to study at ANU. He has a physical disability and would need support. He has emailed A&amp;I and is waiting for an answer, but he would like to know if the university provides enough support for students with disabilities. He has had experiences in the past with disability advisors who offered great adjustments only to refuse to support him when lecturers/unit coordinators refused to implement these adjustments. Would anybody here be able/willing to share their experience as an ANU student with a disability?\n\nThanks!",

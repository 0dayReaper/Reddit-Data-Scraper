    "postText": "I'm currently applying for Bachelors of Arts where I do make the selection rank. However, I wanted to apply for a Bachelors of Political Science however admissions did a 'preliminary assessment' of my application and told me I do not make the selection rank. \n\nThat being said, I was wondering whether I am able to go into ANU doing Arts majoring in PolSci then transferring degree to a Bachelors of PolSsci. I have viewed the website and have seen the deadlines. \n\nMy main question is will my selection rank (ATAR) matter while transferring degrees since I did not make the requirement while applying or do they only look at a students WAM? \n\nThanks in advance!",

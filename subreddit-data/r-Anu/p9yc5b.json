    "postText": "I have received an offer to study engineering at ANU. Mechatronic engineering looks to be the best pick for me, so I was wondering what the opinion of this major is at ANU. I've also heard that there has been some cuts to the engineering faculty, such as withdrawing mechanical engineering (this is the degree I liked the most). So to that point, is mechatronic engineering at ANU a good choice? Or should I preserve the offer as a backup? Thanks",

            "comment": "It was atrocious before the cuts to the engineering faculty, and it could only be worse now. Study something else, or if you're set on engineering, go to another university.\n\nANU doesn't offer mechatronic or mechanical engineering degrees - only systems engineering with a (very content-thin - only a handful of specialised courses) major in a specific area. They try their best to conceal this from incoming students. You won't pick up useful technical skills that engineers from other universities gain, and IMO it's a really poor education in engineering.",

Anu isn't really known for its mechanical engineering, and with the cuts I believe it's all over. The electrical side of things seems really strong if that's your thing. Happy to answer any questions you have.",

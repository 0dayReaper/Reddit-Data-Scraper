    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI did my bachelor in Unimelb and I just received my offer for Master of Applied Finance from ANU.\n\nAfter looking at the course structure and some subject outline, I think I'm eligible for the credits of 3 to 4 subjects. I've contacted the admission team, but they say I can only apply for credits after I accept the offer (a bit unreasonable tbh). But since credits could alter my duration of studies at ANU, I'm a bit uncertain.\n\nHas anyone from Unimelb successfully applied for credits? If so, what are the subjects?",

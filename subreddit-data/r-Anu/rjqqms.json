    "postText": "Hey everyone. After taking a gap year and putting off uni for two years over family issues and covid I've finally accepted an offer to ANU for next year. I'm interested in the on-campus accommodation as a convenient way to socialise and network throughout my first year, but with being 21 was wondering if I'd look out of place and should instead look for a share house? I myself don't necessarily mind being around younger people, my friend group from work right now consists of people ranging from 18-26, but I guess I'm just curious what people have to say from their own experiences. \n\nIf anyone has suggestions for a good hall as well, I'd love to hear it. Thanks for any answers!",

    "postText": "Hi guys!\n\nI am starting my MPP at ANU in Feb 2021.\n\nCurrently sitting at home in Melbourne twiddling my thumbs in lockdown and I thought it would be a good idea to get started on some reading and to learn more about the course.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had lecture notes/materials for some of the core subjects (POGO) in the MPP or the policy analysis specialisation that they would be willing to part with - happy to compensate - just trying to stop myself from going crazy.\n\nThanks in advance and message me if you can help!\n\nCheers :))",

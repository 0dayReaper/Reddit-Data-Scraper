I am a Master of Clinical Psychology student at CDU and am seeking male-identifying Australians to participate in an anonymous online survey. By participating in this 10-minute survey, you can contribute to our understanding of the links between traditional masculinity, gender-roles, anxiety, and help-seeking intentions. I'd really appreciate your contribution if you identify as male and are 18+! Thank you!",

Females are generally more emotionally orientated than males, therefore they generally take one more social roles. These aren\u2019t norms, they are roles of best fit that paint the picture of what defines what is \u201cgeneral\u201d. If you disagree, you\u2019re either disappointed in the truth, or possess a delusion that males and females serve the exact same purpose rather than each optimally perform duties that best fit their biological/physiological utility",

They're not exactly doing the labor of a lumberjack. \n\nAre truckers male while school bus drivers are female (more often)? Hell, truckers aren't allowed to load cargo, and often have upkeep provided. School bus drivers are expected to wash and maintain the bus in the mid-day. For field trips they load all the non-student cargo. Theirs is the more labor intensive job. \n\nAre scientists, engineers, and mathematicians mostly male? Contrary to the last movie you saw those are all extremely social jobs. You aren't doing any of them without a team and a network of consultants. \n\n**Do not waive aside studies like this.** You cannot possibly summarize gender in the western world with \"Men strong, Women compassionate.\"",

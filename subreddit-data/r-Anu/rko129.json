    "postText": "hii\ni just wanted to ask if anyone has done or is currently part of the extension program? I really want to get in specially to either the chemistry or specialist maths extension and my main worry is the entrance exam. \n\nThe students in the information night said there was no way to prepare for the test except for looking through previous ICAS papers or any other tests of the sort.\n\nIs there any other thing that would be helpful for me to know in order to better prepare myself?? tyy!",

Australian Maths Competition questions) could help get you some practice :)\nThe maths entrance exam isn\u2019t super scary from memory. It\u2019s more filled with puzzling problems than a test of heavy mathematical machinery. Please try not to stress over it - especially over summer! Wishing you all the very best!",

I think ICAS/UNSW maths/chem/science tests \\[if they still do those...\\] were fairly similar to the setting of the exam. Otherwise confidence and making sure you remember to bring what you need to \\[I think I forgot an eraser or something when I sat the exam and it threw me off a little lol\\]",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm a first year bachelor of Sci student (hoping to get into post grad med), \n\nI'm only thing 3 classes this semester but after a pretty disruptive last semester, I need to focus on and do well in my core subjects (Chemistry and Biology).   \nThe elective I've currently chosen is quite interesting but just so so time consuming (specific field of study in physics) and I think it might be in my best interests to change but can't really see too many electives that I'm interested in/ many that don't have a pretty heavy workload or difficult content that requires lots of time to be put in. Today's the last day to change classes so if anyone sees this and wants to rattle off a few random elective's they enjoyed/found easy I would be eternally grateful! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers! :)",

    "postText": "Currently looking for a rundown of pros and cons of each avalible accommodation option.I have it down to Lena Karmel, Kinloch and Warrumbul, as I am looking for a studio with at minimum a stove and fridge.A lot of the discussion seems to be based on \"Are there social activities?\" instead of \"What are the amenities; is there a place I can cook?\". Is that really more important to most to have in-lodge interaction over a stove and nice room to stay in?That said I'm open to non-UniLodge places too, but I havent been able to confirm, for any other accommodation other than those I listed, if their studios have a stove and are nice to be in.\n\nEdit: Looks like places such as Graduate House and Ursula Hall Laurus Wing do also offer a self contained studio. While I will stick to requiring a private bathroom and the room to be atleast some what pleasant, if there's no cooking amenities, I realise I can just buy a portable stove and fridge should I so need to.

            "comment": "All self-catered accomodation on campus will naturally have adequate space to cook. The other self-catered halls (i.e. wamburun, fenner, B&amp;G, and Wright which is flexi-catered) that aren't 'lodge' all have communal kitchens, and people generally find that they are actually great places to hang out and get to know the people you're living with. Obviously if you really detest communal cooking then this wouldn't really be for you\n\nTo answer your question though, LK, Kinloch and Warrumbul are really the only on-campus accomodations that have cooking spaces within individual rooms\n\nEDIT: fyi Wamburun is the only hall where each room comes with a mini-fridge. For the other halls you've gotta buy the fridge and install it yourself.",

I found the on-campus accomodation was lack lustre at best for what you are paying. The studio I was in had a really poor stove and I ended up having to buy an induction hot plate anyway.",

Just to clarify the fridge thing as well: all the lodges should have normal sized fridges, it\u2019s the bar fridge in your room (Wamburun, Fenner, B&amp;G) that you need to buy individually since there are larger fridge spaces in the communal kitchens.",

The rooms themselves are adequately sized and if you keep to yourself you'll enjoy the space. However, if you care at all about social interaction (especially as a first year looking to make some long lasting friendships) I would highly recommend applying for non-Unilodge halls. The social programs of halls such as Fenner, Wamburun, Wright, and B&amp;G are far better. Lodge is really lacking in that department.",

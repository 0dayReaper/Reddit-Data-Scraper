    "postText": "Hi, I am an international student and recently I was offered a full scholarship from ANU. In order to accept my scholarship offer, I need to complete a bank account info form. Instructions were given like this:  \"Please also complete the **attached** bank account details form, nominating details of an [Australian Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI)](https://www.apra.gov.au/register-of-authorised-deposit-taking-institutions) bank account, and return to &lt;email&gt;.\" I have few concerns on this. \n\n1. Does this mean that I have to create a savings account in my home country from a bank which has branches in Australia as well? eg: HSBC\n2. Or, does this mean that I just have to give a name (bc the word nominate is there) and create the account after landing to Australia? but then again it says complete the form. Considering the layout of the form, just mentioning the name looks far from complete. \n3. In general, I really do not understand how to fill this. \n\nScholarship acceptance deadline is Nov 5th. So I need this info asap. Please help.",

A colleague, who is an Australian citizen, mentioned it might be worth my while to setup an ING online bank. My concern is ING is not available in my country, but it might available in yours.",

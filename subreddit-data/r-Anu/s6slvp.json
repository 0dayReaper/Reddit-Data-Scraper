    "postText": "Hey\nI am an international relations students. I have received an offer letter from ANU. Being an international student, the tuition is enormous. I would like to know some funding options. \n\nScholarships- Just one option. Others are not available due to Covid.\n\nPart-time Jobs- Are there good options available for international students on campus or outside which can help to atleast cover rent. \n\nOther Aids- Is ANU helpful towards its international students during times such as this and offer any financial aids? \n\nJob Prospects- I would like to know about job prospects too after the programme ends and internships during the programme. Would it be a good Return on Investment as I would like to earn well in AUD after my Studies.\nThank you!",

The only difference is that I've been a master's student for the last year, studying online. I just landed in the country and am also looking for part time jobs and such to cover my rent and living expenses.",

            "comment": "Current ANU student here. There's support options from a variety of ANU organisations. The first go to is the ANU Career's Hub ([https://careerhub.anu.edu.au/students/login?ReturnUrl=%2fstudents](https://careerhub.anu.edu.au/students/login?ReturnUrl=%2fstudents)) which have listings of part time jobs and internships, on and off campus. They also with preparing CVs/Resume and career guidance. I also would attend student organisations events during O-week, such as ANUSA and PARSA ([https://anusa.com.au/employment/](https://anusa.com.au/employment/) for example). Also, if you need immediate financial assistance, the university and student organisations offers financial bursaries ([https://parsa.anu.edu.au/studentsupport/financialsupport/](https://parsa.anu.edu.au/studentsupport/financialsupport/) or [https://www.anu.edu.au/study/accommodation/financial-support](https://www.anu.edu.au/study/accommodation/financial-support) )\n\nLastly, when it comes to employment, I would recommend contacting the lecturers of the courses you are doing as a starting point. There are many staff that are there to help you, so might as well ask! :) Hope this helps, and best of luck :)",

    "postText": "Hey, sorry if this has been asked before. I'm doing some classes next year which cite courses I've done this year as essential knowledge. I want to keep the content just in case, but I'm wondering if I'll still have access to the pages next year, or whether I should save hard copies? Also, if they do get deleted, when does that happen?\n\nThanks!!",

            "comment": "Hi OP, I'm having the same debate right now haha! I'm pretty sure that the offers are not conditional (Congrats on the offer btw!). And, if you decide to change preferences (you can do so in a few days), I'm pretty sure ANU will use whatever is highest out of your atar or selection rank. Either way, I think you should definitely feel more relaxed knowing that these coming exams won't affect whether you go to uni or not.\n\nPersonally, I'm still going to put in the work because it feels kinda dumb just to completely slack off with a month to go. That being said, I'm definitely studying less than if I hadn't applied for early entry, so feeling super lucky that I made that choice back in April. \n\nWhatever you choose to do, all the best for the next few weeks! We're almost there :D",

Thanks for your words, it's oddly comforting to know that someone else is also in a similar position\n\nAnd yeah you're right, I suppose if not for myself I'll have to try and do well for my classmates (because scaling is based off how your school does in HSC right?). \n\nCheers and thanks again. Goodluck to you too!!",

I did however set myself a goal of at least achieving the minimum ATAR required for my program as opposed to the best ATAR I could achieved. It helped me at least breathe a bit. Hope that helps and good luck with ur HSC, u got this!",

So to do the best they can but to also recognise their mental health is important.\n\nThey are still working towards their goals, but realistically their results will not be what they would have been without covid.  And they should acknowledge that and be ok with that.  My child is very much a perfectionist and has their sites set on doing their absolute best so it\u2019s tricky.  \n\nIn the long run the grades you get in high school don\u2019t matter ( as someone with a phd, etc) - but each step towards your goal does matter.   What you do now - will help you in your future study and ultimately make it easier.   But you don\u2019t have to put the pressure on yourself that normally (and in my opinion- should be abnormal) comes with being in year 12 in the quest to get into your choice at uni.   \n\nMy advice - Do still work to get your grades to fulfill the requirements and to learn what you need to to make your uni life easier.  But don\u2019t go all out.",

Personally, as a post-graduate student, I have never studied as hard as I did in year 12, but given disruptions from COVID, do the best you can! I believe in you! :)",

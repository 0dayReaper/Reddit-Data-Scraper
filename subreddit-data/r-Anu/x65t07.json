            "comment": "u/Sure_Needleworker934, its purely based on your IB scores. From what i understand, regardless of what curriculum you apply from - ANU converts your scores to an ANU GPA scale and then the top students get the scholarships. There's allocations based on countries that you come from too. So overall, it seems like a purely competitive process.   \n\n\nI gathered this from the conditions of award here - [https://www.anu.edu.au/study/scholarships/find-a-scholarship/anu-chancellors-international-scholarship](https://www.anu.edu.au/study/scholarships/find-a-scholarship/anu-chancellors-international-scholarship)   \n\n\nSo best to check with someone from the uni incase i've misinterpreted it :)",

From what I heard, it would be more competitive to get the scholarship the following semesters, but who knows you might get lucky.",

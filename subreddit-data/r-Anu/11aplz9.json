    "postText": "I am looking into applying for the Tuckwell scholarship but I am a bit sure as to what they are looking for. Is it purely academic excellence, leadership, community service, a combination, or something else?\n\nI am great on the academic side, with a 99+ predicted ATAR, and I have gotten top of many subjects such as Maths, engineering, Science, Languages and Drama while also competing internationally in academic events, receiving an award from the ADF for innovation and achieving Dux of the year for 4 straight years. I also complete 10 hours of community service per year. \n\nI am unsure as to whether only having academic achievements will be detrimental, as Ido not have any leadership roles within the college, and do not work outside of school. \n\nAre my attributes what the scholarship is looking for or should I attempt to perform more leadership roles and assist more in the community?",

You need to do 10x more to even mention it as community service. \nAdditionally, Tuckwell is littered with 99+ projected applicants, you need to have something that sets you apart in either your interests or your personality. \nThey don\u2019t have specific criteria but speak about being unique. The ATAR is seemingly irrelevant with them due to wanting people who are going to enrich more than just academics at ANU. \nMake sure that you don\u2019t hide any of your talents, quirks or hobbies as these form a picture that the panel would be able to work with.",

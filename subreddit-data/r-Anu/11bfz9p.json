The distinct difference I find between school leavers and mature aged students is that you don't share the same kind of stress. Having functioned as an adult and been in the workforce for the past 12 or so years prior to starting, you have likely have developed some sort of work ethic. You'll likely prioritise things a bit easier, and have the discipline to carry it out. \n\nIf you find you learn better with people around you, find some like minded individuals - put yourself out there. It's always good to be able to bounce ideas off of others and have a second opinion on something. I personally have found that having a good group has really helped me.

    "postText": "Following the two day strike, the sub is once again open, as people do use it to ask anonymous questions and there was a surprising amount of requests for access.  It rather sucks for us, because we're going to have to learn how to use Redreader, but there is a limited amount that can be done unless another strike of large scale is organized.  In the mean time, we do remind users that there will always be the Discord for asking questions anonymously, as well as places such as Schmidtposting.\n\n*If the sub becomes private again, please don't message us for access.  Just like last time, there will be a message displaying why.*",

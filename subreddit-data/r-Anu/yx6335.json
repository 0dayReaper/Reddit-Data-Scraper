    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI was wondering how hard it is to transfer between degrees in the ANU. I currently have an early entry offer to study political science, however I want to study law. I think it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll get the 97 ATAR needed to get in.\n\nApparently you need a 5.6GPA which is between a credit and a distinction to transfer, how hard is it to achieve this? Is it an easy process to transfer between degrees? Are applications to transfer often granted? \n\nAlso would it be easier going to Macquarie uni for law which I have an early offer for and then transferring to law at ANU or would the internal transfer be easier?\n\nThanks in advance.",

            "comment": "Hello,\n\nI transferred into law this year and it was a really easy process. You will have to complete at least a semester in your sole political science degree, maybe two. However, as long as you put in a reasonable amount of study and get above the 5.6 GPA requirement (think more like 6.0 as closer to being a guaranteed spot, higher the better), then you'll be fine. Transferring between universities will almost certainly be much more difficult than transferring internally. Personally, despite transferring into law a semester after starting uni, it won't extend the overall length of my degree at all due to some careful subject selection, so keep in mind that its a good idea to complete as many compulsory subjects for your non-law degree as soon as possible so as not to extend your degree.\n\nOf course, the choice is yours, but I would strongly recommend going to the university you want to be at first and foremost, and then consider your preferred degrees within that university. \n\nBest of luck",

I know A LOT of people who have transferred into law from another degree, and it\u2019s definitely very achievable.\n\nThere was no minimum requirement to transfer between degrees when my friend transferred between finance and economics in his first year, as I think they still only considered his ATAR at that point given he was a first year, but law might be a bit different, definitely good to look into that.\n\nBut yes internal transfer is very achievable, I would personally recommend just going to ANU!",

Last year I chatted to admissions at CoL about this kinda thing, and I believe they said the GPA requirement is lower for internal transfers (take that with a grain of salt) - so my advice would definitely be to start off at ANU.",

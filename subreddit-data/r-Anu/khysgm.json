It\u2019s unfair, immoral and borderline illegal because it infringes upon a basic constitutional right of \u201cthe presumption of innocence\u201d. The legal burden of proof should rest on the university to prove (beyond a reasonable doubt) that all 300 (or a partial) people did plagiarise. Otherwise, no penalty should be applied besides a reshuffle of distribution among the assessments of course to compensate for the fact that the assessment at hand is compromised.",

As a current ANU student, based on my own experiences, it would not be in the University\u2019s institutional character to intervene. Stuff like this happens all the time on a smaller scale and nothing gets done, ESPECIALLY with regard to excessively harsh grading. Now that it\u2019s been picked up by the media the University might step in, but ordinarily it would be very unlikely that the decision is walked back.\n\nEDIT: Just googled it and what do you know, they\u2019re walking it back in the least helpful way possible",

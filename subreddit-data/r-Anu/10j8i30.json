I can\u2019t remember the exact date but near the end of semester one they open a portal where you can apply to move accommodations. Last year a bunch of my friends applied and they were all able to move. If you are accepted you are given a move in date for the new accomodation. On that date you leave the old one, and stop paying for it, and you move into the new one, and start paying for it.",

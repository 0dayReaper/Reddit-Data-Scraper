I can\u2019t take either intro courses in sem 2 so was hoping the other courses would be fine\n\nThanks",

If the intro classes aren\u2019t stated there, then it should be fine, but intro classes are intro classes for a reason sooooo it\u2019s probably best to do them first if you can.",

They\u2019re quite different in nature (1002 is general politics &amp; sub fields overview, 1009 more on the academic side.) It may be harder to pick research topics without that background, but you can always just go where your interests take you. At the end of the day they\u2019re both intro courses, so shouldn\u2019t be too strenuous.",

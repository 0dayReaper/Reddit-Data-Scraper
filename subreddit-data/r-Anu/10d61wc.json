Due to my financial circumstances, I will not be able to afford to stay at Yukeembruk and would prefer to transfer into _________. \n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nKind regards,\n\n__________.\u201d\n\nBe kind and patient, they\u2019re currently experiencing approx 1,000 emails a week and have a brand new team of staff. If it\u2019s urgent and will lapse soon call them. \n\nJust an FYI this probably won\u2019t work for Bruce and Wright as they are pretty much at capacity so you\u2019ll probably be waitlisted and there\u2019s very little chance you\u2019ll be able to transfer to these halls.",

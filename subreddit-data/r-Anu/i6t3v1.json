It\u2019s a really frustrating asterisk to the otherwise positive early admissions process. If you\u2019re really keen on getting the transfer process done quickly, try and do 4 courses in your first semester to get that admin out of the way. But it isn\u2019t really that significant, just enrol in the courses you want to do in your future degree. Anyway, congratulations.",

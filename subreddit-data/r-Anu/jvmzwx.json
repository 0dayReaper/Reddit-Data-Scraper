In terms of courses, they're very similar - BSEng just has a few less electives.\n\nSimilar deal with BAC R&amp;D, it's more prestigious/restrictive/rigorous and has an 80% minimum average grade requirement. Other than the cooler name, I haven't seen many benefits of it over regular BAC, but I think that's probably due to COVID. I'm hoping it'll help with networking and skipping courses and though.\n\nI'm only a first-year though, so if you want other perspectives the CompSci Student Association has a [pretty active Discord server](https://discord.gg/kcnwUW9hVQ).",

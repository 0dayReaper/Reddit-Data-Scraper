So you could use as much as you wanted but you had to pay for it. Quite a lot of data was exempt (anything sourced from a .edu address, and various commonly used file mirrors etc. was free), but it still added up quickly.\n\nHaving said that, it was lightning fast. Having an effectively 100 Mbps up and down connection to the internet was amazing in a world where home broadband was typically 256 or 512 kbps, and many people were still on dialup.\n\nOf course, being on a giant LAN with the rest of the university meant that you only needed one person to grab a big download and then they could distribute it to everyone else. P2P sharing across the LAN was rampant and people set up FTP servers to host libraries of files for other people on campus to access for free.",

There is an acceptable use policy and everything you do is tied to your university ID, so theoretically you could get into trouble for violating that.\n\nAlso, all ANU internet uses 802.1x (WPA Enterprise) authentication, which many devices like gaming consoles, TVs, etc do not support. Keep that in mind when you decide what to bring with you.",

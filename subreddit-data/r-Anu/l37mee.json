    "postText": "Hey, I'll be starting at ANU in a few weeks, doing the Advanced Science ('honours') degree. I was just curious; what is the typical way to complete my 144 units? For example, is it viable to do something like a Human Biology major (48 units), a neuroscience and Physiology specialisation (24), a computer science minor (24), plus the prerequisite HPO courses for my 4th year (24), plus some miscellaneous electives (24), which would take me to the required 144 over three years? Is this a common thing, to do both a specialisation and a minor? Or is it worthwhile to just complete two majors instead? I'm unsure, but I just want to make the most of my required time. If anyone could give some advice that would be great :). For extra information, I am considering doing a PhD after my honours year.",

Not too sure if I answered ur question, but have a look at the bottom of this website. \n\n[Study Planner](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/ascad)\n\n(click the study tab)",

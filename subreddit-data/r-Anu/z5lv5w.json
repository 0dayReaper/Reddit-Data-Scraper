Generally it\u2019s been a 2-hour lecture each week per law subject, as well as what tend to be called \u2018seminars\u2019 but are really tutorials. You meet weekly in a class-size group with a teacher, and tend to go through practice questions/scenarios. It aims to encourage discussion, but obviously only a smaller number of kids tend to be forthcoming.\n\nThe lecturers and tutors do seem to care about you in general though. Most of my law lecturers have gone above and beyond in terms of supporting our learning experience. Overall whilst it\u2019s been challenging, I struggle to say bad things about the law school",

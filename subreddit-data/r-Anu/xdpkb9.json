    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am completing the HSC in NSW and ANU has always been my dream university. I didn't get an early entry offer and have been waitlisted for my year 12 results. I have been trying to study more since trials as I didn't go well in them. \n\nI am worried that I won't make in into ANU, so I have applied to UC as a backup. \n\n(I would like to do either IR or Econ. or double degree with both)\n\nQuestions:\n\nHow long will I have to wait until I am able to transfer?\n\nAre there certain marks I need to attain at UC to get into ANU? \n\nAny other info?",

My partner had a low ATAR and did a semester at UC, hated it and transferred over. He got bonus points and got in because we moved since the HSC and now in the lowest 25% socioeconomic suburbs  (Belconnen, the suburb near UC). \n\nIf the above won\u2019t apply to you you can transfer after 8 courses (usually one year full time) and that will be based on your GPA from UC. You\u2019ll have to check the GPA requirements with ANU, they might change across degrees too.",

    "postText": "ATTENTION TO DETAIL\n\nHi people! \nMy name is Momo, and I am looking for participants for my psychology honours project about attention to detail.\n\nThis study contains two parts. \n&gt; In the first session you will need to do a paper-folding task for ten minutes with a group of 4-5 other ANU students and complete a questionnaire after the task. The first session takes approximately 30 minutes. \n&gt; In session two, you will need to complete an online survey 24 hours after the first experiment, which takes about 15 minutes (you do not need to come to the lab for part 2).\n&gt; After you completed the online survey, you will receive the $15 compensation. \n\nLocation: ANU Research School of Psychology, Room 201.\n\nIf you are interested, shoot me a message or you can click the SONA link to sign up: https://anupsych.sona-systems.com/default.aspx?p_return_experiment_id=962 \n\nIf you have any questions, please contact me: u6878514@anu.edu.au \n\nThe ethical aspects of this study have been approved by the ANU Human Research Ethics Committee (Protocol No. 2022/211).",

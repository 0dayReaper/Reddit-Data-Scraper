I guess the key questions to ask are if you want to be in a studio room or in a share (1-5 others), whether the room has AC in it (all in my experience have heating, but may be really hot during summer), and what appliances come with the place (eg most have microwaves, some have ovens etc) - I suggest you check here to start off - https://www.anu.edu.au/study/accommodation/compare-residences . Also if you don't like the place there's ways to transfer to other halls Good luck! :)",

If you're in a studio, I know Warrumbul and LK have ACs, Wamburun has fans and don't know about the others. I'm pretty sure that all the common spaces in all the buildings have some form of AC though. Hope this helps!",

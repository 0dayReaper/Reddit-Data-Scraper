ANU will honour these for study in 2023 as long as you complete Year 12 and receive an ATAR.  \nIf your Year 11 results don't meet entry requirements, we will put you on our waiting list and automatically consider your application again based on your Year 12 results in the December/January offer round.  \nWe have adjusted our co-curricular or service requirement requirements due to the disruptions of COVID-19.  \n\n\nu/Rich_Swimming266 u/Illustrious_Light104",

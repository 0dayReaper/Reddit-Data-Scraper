    "postText": "Hello guys, I\u2019m planning to go to the ANU in 2021 and I\u2019ve got my mind set on the double degree of Commerce/Criminology but I was just wondering if studying two degree at once is harder than a single degree or not, especially in an academically well-regarded institution such as ANU. And is this a good degree combination?",

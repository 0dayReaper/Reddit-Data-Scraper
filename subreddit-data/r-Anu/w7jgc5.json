    "postText": "Hello,\n\nAs it turns out there's no vacancies on campus and I'm currently on the waiting list. I was wondering if anybody knows if I am likely to be accepted for Burton and Garran or Wamburun anytime soon (within a few weeks), if it's completely unknowable, or if it is a lost cause altogether.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit: Apparently overnight there were several vacancies that opened up in Wamburun! Thank you guys for your replies!",

You can find their contact details on the hall websites and i've heard of instances where it's worked before.\n\nSomething on the lines of you wanting to be part of their community, support system, how you would contribute back etc.",

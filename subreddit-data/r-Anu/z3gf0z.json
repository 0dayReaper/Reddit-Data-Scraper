UNSW Sydney's undergrad is probably the best nationally at the moment, ANU can really only compete on research options and public sector connections. They're much more CS-focused. UNSW Canberra (ADFA) also excels in some Defence-related areas, but those are usually postgrad.\n\nANU is definitely worth considering if you're not set on cybersecurity though. And honestly work/personal experience has been far more valuable for my career than uni, so the lifestyle aspects of Canberra vs Sydney are worth considering",

I haven't seen many other posts regarding international grad school applicants. Is your grad school relatively competitive? I'd love to know anyone's opinion, thank you!",

Going international is an opportunity I'd love to have, and though UIUC is a good school, I'm incredibly excited about the prospect of going somewhere else. It is admittedly a bit disappointing that you had to leave Australia to find better training in the states, but I'm more married to the idea of place and opportunity compared to optimized training. Thank you for your opinion, and interesting perspective.",

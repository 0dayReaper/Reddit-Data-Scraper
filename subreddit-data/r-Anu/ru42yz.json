The start/finish times are often emailed or posted on Wattle, and this site can help to plan: https://timetable.cssa.club",

            "comment": "**Some tips when choosing classes on the timetable:**\n\nif the letters change (eg. A, B, C) they're teaching different content so you have to attend all of them once.\n\nIf the numbers change (eg. B02, B08, etc) then its the same content being taught but at different times. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen choosing tutorials, trust me, you would want to refresh the page when they say it will come out. especially since ur doing commerce subjects, they're SUPER POPULAR cause most commerce subjects u take first sem are compulsory courses (eg. BUSN1001, ECON1101, STAT1008). They are gone within 30 seconds sometimes.",

    "postText": "Hi, I have some questions about Fenner and Wamburun - I promise I've already looked through what has been already asked and answered. Thank you in advance!\n\n1. How do bathrooms and showers at Fenner compare to that of Wamburun (I've seen Fenner's virtual tour but Wamburun doesn't have one)\n\n2. I've heard Fenner's kitchen is quite small (considering there's a lot of students), is this the same for Wamburun?  Is there a difference in storage/fridge space you get?\n\n3.  What is the difference in the culture like between Fenner and Wamburun?",

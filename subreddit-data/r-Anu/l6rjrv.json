But I think I'll have to transfer to a bachelor of business because I want to major in marketing\u2014 do you think that a degree change from commerce to business will cause a hassle in transferring credits when i move to ANU?",

When you're applying for credit, you will get all the credit points but they may not necessarily cover all the units you did at UC. If you do decide to transfer to a bachelor of business, you most likely will get credit for most of the introductory courses and electives. In my case, I did a double major in accounting and finance at UC but I only got credit for business decision making, quantitative methods in commerce and financial institutions and markets. The rest of the credit points went towards the college of business &amp; economics list 1 electives. To guarantee an offer from ANU for commerce, I would recommend maintaining a gpa above 5.0 and a wam above 70 If there's any other queries, please do not hesitate to pm me.",

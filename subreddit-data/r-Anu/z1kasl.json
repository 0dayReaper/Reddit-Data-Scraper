            "comment": "Both are excellent. I will say that UNSW is probably more famous on the software engineering, industry, side of computer science while ANU is more research (so theoretical and mathematical) and government/policy focused so things like cybersecurity and infrastructure. However, both offer options in each respective niche as well. This is largely in line with the job opprotunities for graduates. UNSW graduates tend to go to your typical technology start up or Big tech firms while ANU graduates are disproportionately represented in the public service and the like. Statistics are broadly the same across the two. There\u2019s only so many ways you can reach and learn statistics at the undergraduate level.",

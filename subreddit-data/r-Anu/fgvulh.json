I was wondering if anyone that made it through to stage 2, 3 or even got the scholarship could give me some tips/guidance in the best way to make it the furthest in the application process!",

            "comment": "My advice would be don't try to give them what you think they're looking for! Try and be completely yourself and don't think too much or too deeply about what they what to hear, because what they want to hear is you being you. \n\nFrom what I remember stage 1 is mostly just objective stuff (academics, extracurriculars?) so beef that up with pretty much every cool thing you can remember doing over your high school years. Hopefully, there's also some community-oriented stuff in that mix! They're very into that. \n\nTry and find a teacher that you know will do a great job of writing you a reference (ideally who has experience doing these kinds of things) and that will able to give a good balance of recommending you both as a person and as a student. Maybe send them some info about the scholarship and the traits if they haven't written recommendations for it before.\n\nThen in Stage 2 when they start hitting you with the more personal and weird questions, just try to be genuine and show the way you think! It's very easy to see in Stage 3 the types of people who put on a facade/pretend to be the kind of person they think will get it, and the panel does a really good job of weeding those people out, so don't do that! \n\nI hope this helps and it isn't too late, I know they've extended the deadline this year and the Stage 1 deadline is still a while away yet :)",

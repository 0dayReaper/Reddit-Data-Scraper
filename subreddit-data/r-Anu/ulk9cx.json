    "postText": "I applied for a place at Burton &amp; garran hall since it\u2019s the cheapest hall on campus but i know that i may not be guaranteed to get the hall that i want if many people apply for the same hall so i have been looking at other accommodations at unilodge as well but still can\u2019t seem to find the one within my budget ($200 a week). Anyone knows which unilodge/house sharing apartment is within that range? \n\nAlso, is it possible to apply for many unilodge accommodations at the same time? Should I wait for the accommodation offer on-campus first before finding alternatives or will that be too late to find a place to stay this july semester?\n\nLastly, if you have any valuable info/tips abt ANU/Canberra accommodations &amp; willing to share pls do! I would really appreciate your help! Thank you!",

If no other colleges are going to be within your budget it might be a good idea to start looking pretty soon for places to rent particularly if you have no rental history. It may take a few months to find a place. Try having a search on some share house sites too because people often move out around that time and houses may be looking for an extra person. Good luck!",

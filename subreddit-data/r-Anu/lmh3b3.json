Classes start on the 22nd of Feb(4 days from now).\n\nWhat do you all think I should do about Accommodations? (I am from Victoria.)\n\nIs there a way to maybe fast-track the process for accommodations?\n\nOtherwise going to have to house share and in that case where should I look location-wise?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Issue was resolved thanks for the advice.",

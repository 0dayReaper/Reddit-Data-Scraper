    "postText": "Is anyone knowledgeable on how ANU calculates their selection rank? I calculated my selection rank based on the 2020 scaling report from VCAA and predicted a much higher selection rank than I received from ANU.\n\nIs there a particular way ANU calculates the selection rank from yr 11 grades? I was under the impression they take both semesters one and two into consideration and calculate from which classes you have indicated you will be continuing in yr 12.",

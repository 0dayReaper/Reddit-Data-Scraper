    "postText": "I got Master of Business Information System by both ANU and UQ. And I compared the courses of them and I think ANU's maybe more technical oriented, while UQ's has more other business courses(e.g Accounting, Finance). I am an international student and my bachelor degree is Human Resource Management so most courses I took related to business/commerce.Are there any mates know which one is more suitable and more useful for my future career? Thanks a lot!",

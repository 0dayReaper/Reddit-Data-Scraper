I received an offer from ANU Bachelor of Advanced Computing (R&amp;D) (Honours) and UniMelb Bachelor of Science. Would anyone be kind enough to list the pros and cons of each uni/program (e.g. prestige, overseas opportunities, internships, program structure, professors, support systems, social life, etc.)? I honestly have no idea where to go. Thanks so much!",

            "comment": "Following up from your pm. In terms of research, ANU's pretty great for most of CS - I know multiple first-years who got research projects in their first semester. Even in R&amp;D it's very self-driven though, all about reaching out to researchers and networking (getting coffee is often a great start). Plenty of opportunities if you're driven, even with covid - summer research projects are very common.\n\nIn terms of coursework, it's one of the most rigorous I've seen (no MIT, but one of the best in aus). First-year is tame by default, but ANU's pretty flexible so you're able to swap out courses for more difficult alternatives. There are some limitations to this though, and top students will often transfer to a [PhB](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/aphsc). R&amp;D's been more than challenging enough for me though, even having worked in software engineering beforehand, so be prepared to swap to an easier course if needed - eg some people do MATH2222 in first semester, but it crushed me and I barely passed.\n\nThe downside of smaller-uni flexibility is there's a lot of variety in teaching quality, although CECS tutors are usually pretty great. It's worth asking past students before enrolling, usually in the CompSci Student Association (CSSA) [Discord server](http://cssa.club/discord).\n\nIn terms of employment, it's almost all public sector. If you can't get security clearance, be prepared for a tough time. That said, there's plenty of good opportunities, and far less competition than other unis, so I feel like there's better chances here. Sydney is also an option too, lots of grads move there for big tech.",

            "comment": "Hey mate,\n\nI completed my BAC R&amp;D a few years back and will be going to MIT to study a PhD soon so similar path to what you want to do.\n\nIn my opinion ANU is going to be a much stronger program than Melbourne if your objective is to go to the US to do post-grad study. \n\nThis is because R&amp;D is a research heavy program and will give you the opportunity to do significant research and publish papers. Evidence of your ability to do impactful research is probably the most important factor for a graduate application.\n\nIn terms of internships if you're looking to do industry work you will have more luck in Melbourne. Many big tech companies (Atlassian, Amazon, Canva, etc.) do not even bother going to Canberra for hiring events.\n\nFeel free to PM with any specific questions!",

I think I\u2019ll just go there for a semester until US undergrad offers are released (we already have a house down there so financially more viable) and if I\u2019m unlucky, will probs transfer to ANU. Did u do a masters degree since ANU, or is r&amp;d accepted as a masters degree for MIT?",

            "comment": "Looks like youre in a similar situation as me! I think I got a few ideas that could come in handy. So I have applied to Unimelb and ANU under BSC and BAC R&amp;D (and MIT in the states cuz I felt like it) and I have looked into all of their courses.  \n\nLong story short, I'm not a big fan of Unimelb style cuz they have their own thing called 'Unimelb model' where they encourage you to do 3 years of Undergrad and 2 years of post grad, total 5 years and you graduate with a masters degree.\n\nUnimelb encourages students to enrol in more diverse papers in the first year so your expertise isn't just your own major/degree. So for CS in first year at unimelb it's gonna be like for sem1; one CS paper, one calculus paper and 2 science electives. When I say science electives they can be anything under BSC degree. same with Sem 2. As you progress their are more CS papers in second and third year. They aren't that advanced though. \n\nOne important thing is that Unimelb has discrete maths in the third year so I'm not really sure what's happening there. \n\nOn the other hand, ANU (just like all the other unis) only specialise in one degree/major you want to do and stay on that path the whole time till you graduate (4 year course). Definitely more advanced and more papers available to you that is to do with CS and SE and CE. They also have discrete maths as their first year paper. More similar to MIT I would say.\n\nI've been looking at US postgrad stuff as well but there has been a rumour where they prefer 4 year undergrad graudates than 3 year, but at the end I don't think it matters unless you have good grades, good transcript and a good recommendation letter from your professor. \n\nSome reason even thought I don't really like unimelb I'm still going to it lmao and apparently there was a guy who got google internship in his second year through unimelb so at the end it's that bad at all. But if you're a Science person rather than engineering person, it shouldn't matter too much.\n\nFeel free to ask me questions I think I know quite a bit about this topic aha. Good luck!",

                    "comment": "A 4 year degree should be honours which is essentially a big research project you spend a whole year on.\n\nThis is definitely important if you are looking to do post-grad since ability to do research is one of the most important components of your application.\n\nUnless you are a genius with lots of published papers by your 3rd year, I would say it's difficult when you're competing against other international students with 4 year degrees\n\nI think most US unis expect a 4 year undergraduate degree if you want to apply to a PhD. Note undergrad degrees take 4 years in the US.\n\nIf you're looking to do a master's then maybe the story is different.",

Unimelb has ~25k undergrads as opposed to ANU's ~10k. I'd also agree that FAANG have less of a presence here (although growing), it's mostly public sector and smaller tech.",

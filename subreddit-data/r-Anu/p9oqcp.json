    "postText": "I've been given an offer for the Bachelor of Philosophy - Science program, which I understand to be a somewhat prestigious, research intensive course. However, having an interest in neuroscience, it has been a toss-up between UniMelb/UniSyd, where the neuroscience courses are better, and ANU, where I would have great research opportunities.\n\nI have heard from ANU graduates that neuroscience is a low priority for ANU, and the decision to cut the Neuroscience research department (Although it has been cancelled), is indicative of this.\n\nFurthermore, while ANU ranks as some of the best in the world in the humanities - science, including neuroscience do not do as well. I am aware of the popularity of astrophysics are ANU, but I have heard little, other than the Eccles, about neuroscience. \n\nOn the other hand, every academic researcher I have spoken to have suggested I do ANU, as the practical research experience is invaluable compared to any coursework that I could do. I tend to agree with this, and that is why I am leaning towards ANU.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, just to know what I am getting myself into, I ask:\n\n**Just how bad (or not good) is science at ANU?**\n\n**How much will I be disadvantaged compared to other universities 'better' for neuroscience such as UniSyd or UniMelb?**",

Also the labs here and the research department are something you can utilise very early on, so I would recommend that if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. Also a tonne of post grads doing research, some of which help with classes",

I agree with your academic mentors that the research experience was really useful, and was a great foundation for me. It is easy to do research projects at ANU (in particular medical science fields such as Neuroscience for the next few years) as a PhB student which is why I think it'll be more beneficial to you as an undergrad than other unis. If want to see other research institutes it's not uncommon for ANU students to do Summer/Winter Internships in other places (eg I got a paid research opportunity at a Sydney Hospital tied in with USYD even as an ANU student) - lecturers at ANU are reputed so you'll have opportunities for them to suggest Research Group Leaders that are right for you and even contact them on your behalf!\r  \n\r  \nUnis everywhere are taking a hit unfortunately - bigger universities are having some of the most staff cuts in them. As a student you can learn to be an advocate for your education and ultimately the importance of Science - there'll be plenty of opportunities to do this at ANU. \n\nMany of my cohort from PhB did  amazing things with their research projects and beyond - feel free to DM me and I'm happy to give a run down!",

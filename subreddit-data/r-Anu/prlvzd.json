            "comment": "Summer break begins at the end of semester two exams (normally mid-November) and goes through to mid-late February (normally around the 20th of Feb). Semester one will then run through to late May, then a roughly two month break till the end of July. The uni also follows public holidays, so there's usually no live classes on those days. Each semester has a two week break after week six. Here's the university calendar for exact dates: https://www.anu.edu.au/directories/university-calendar",

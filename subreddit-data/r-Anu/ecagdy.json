            "comment": "Always a good idea to start early, I personally started at around this time last year as well. Ensure that you have the things required to start your HECS application (including TFN etc). Doing it now would be perfect so that you can get through your ANU application without any delay. In regards with your timetable, now is perfect (just ensure you know what subjects you\u2019re doing but assuming you\u2019re entering to become a first year student, you know what classes you need to get through). The ANU Official timetable scheduler is hard and complicated to understand. I highly recommend the \u2018Unofficial ANU timetables\u2019 - link (www.anutimetable.com). It\u2019s simple and very easy to use. Any issues, feel free to DM or comment.",

            "comment": "Hi! My experience is a bit different to your every day JD, I was in the online program (when it was still available) and worked full time while pulling a 50% load (2 units a semester). Although it changes a bit for each unit, generally you'll get a class structure of (per week):\n\n* 2 hours lectures\n* 1-2 hours tutorial\n\nReadings are, as you'd expect for a law course, consistently high load. They are manageable though if you remain consistent and thorough in your reading (and get very good at austlii searches for judgment summaries). \n\nFor more core courses (the Priestley 11 + International Law) your assignments will be:\n\n* Essay (mid-sem)\n* Exam (we seem to have done away with invigilated exams, now online and open book largely). \n* Some other form of small weight assignment: quizzes/participation/short form assignment\n\nElectives, which will kick in during the second half of your degree change up the assignment structure a bit more. You're less likely to see exams, more likely to get a practical assignment mid-sem and a large essay at the end of semester. \n\nI am a HD student though and I will say that law doesn't hand them out easily, but they're pretty achievable if you work consistently and diligently from Week 1.  It's easy to fall behind, and very hard to catch up. But if you're building a strong note set from Day 1, keeping on top of your readings and starting assignments NOT two days before they're due - you'll do fine. If you can write well and build a logical argument that's frankly most of the skill behind it. I'm hardly the brightest bulb in the pack, but hard work gets me through. \n\nWhatever you decide, I wish you the best of luck!",

            "comment": "G'day! So for starters, I'm an fifth year LLB/PPE and not a HD student. However, from what I've seen, the major difference between LLB and JD has often manifested in changes to word limits, weightings and due dates of assessments rather than anything fundamentally different in the course load or content.\n\nSo, point by point as you raised them from what I know/have experienced:\n\n**Readings**\n\nThere are, as noted above here, substantial quantities of readings for all of your law courses, and you'll struggle to consistently get HDs/Ds without doing at least the core readings. For reference, LAWS2205 Equity and Trusts (likely either the last or second last core core you'll do) has a 19 page reading guide chock full of cases, casebook references and hyperlinks to dusty cases from 1615. I've found a useful way to get around the volume of reading is to get a group of friends together and, having done the core case readings yourself, split the optional cases between you, though I've lucked out with an awesome group of friends whose case summaries I trust. Overall, readings can be a bit of a slog, but it comes with the territory. \n\n**Assessment**\n\nWhilst CoL has tried to be a little more creative with assessments (especially last sem, lots of choice between essays, exams and short answer stuff), most of the Priestley's will fall into a pattern of: Mid-Sem (somewhere between 20-40%) and Final (somewhere between 60-80%) with another small online quiz or short answer making up any difference and marks deductible but not gainable for tutorial attendance. Electives can be more fun, with everything from mock court appearances, online blog posts, mock submissions to the AAT and, what I'm currently procrastinating right now, using policy modelling software to design a 'questionnaire' for a piece of legislation. Overall, CoL seems to favour large, summative assessment over small, piecemeal stuff but that can very slightly course to course. \n\n**Essays**\n\nPlenty of them. AGLC is a nightmare but, overall, usually between 1500 and 4000 words (though later year essays usually sit around 2500-3000 words) They have their preferred ways and styles (especially subheadings, they love subheadings), but normally CoL is pretty good at setting expectations for essays out pretty early and, as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, you can HD them.\n\n**Coursework**\n\nDon't fall behind. Simple advice, but seriously, looking up at even two weeks of content can be daunting, let alone 4 or 5. Stay on top and you'll be able to manage it, though a full course load of pure LAWS coded courses can be brutal, so may be worth looking for one that interests you or which has assessments which suit your style to give you one course worth of 'breathing room'.\n\n**Advice**\n\nLaw school is great. We all complain about it but seriously, I've made some great friends, learned a lot (but forgotten plenty too), been able to challenge myself and actually find a couple of niches which might interest me as a career. Been plenty of downs over time, been tempted to drop the degree more than once (I'm looking at you P in torts after an 80% exam), but overall a great experience. \n\nBest of luck with your JD, I'm sure it'll be a great adventure for you!",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! I have recently been looking into accomodation, and I\u2019ve narrowed it down to these two options. First of all from what I\u2019ve read uni-lodge doesn\u2019t seem like the best option judging by their complaints, so could someone please tell me if that has changed in the recent years?\n\nFor me there is two big factors that have been playing on my mind, one is the bathrooms, the other is community life. Having my own personal bathroom is something that I really want to prioritise considering that I\u2019m a bit squeamish, can anyone that lives that Wamburun (or has encounter the bathrooms there) please tell me what the bathrooms are like? Because I\u2019ve heard that the community life in Wamburun is really amazing.\n\nLena Karmel is kind of the opposite, it has its own bathrooms but apparently it has a lot of maintenance and isolation issues.\n\nCould someone please recommend something to me?\n\nThank you so much for all your help!",

            "comment": "Community at Wamburun is very welcoming option compared to Lena Karmel. However, hygiene isn't always up to snuff. There are plenty of toilet stalls. However, they are not always clean. Depends on the day. Usually it's perfectly fine. Sometimes it isn't. Bathrooms are rarely dirty as the water usually washes everything away.\n\n-Edit: oh and kitchen is also not always clean. On a packed day, you'll likely have to clean the kitchen counters\n\nCan't say for Lena as I've never been.\n\nHope that helps!",

Maintenance isn\u2019t the best, but usually you can expect about a week to have something fixed if it isn\u2019t urgent. However, you will not have a social life there, it\u2019s mainly for people who want to exist by themselves. You can invite friends over, but it\u2019ll be extremely difficult making friends there in comparison to wambam. It worked out fine for me because I prefer being alone rather than having to interact with people every time I\u2019m hungry or wanting to go to the bathroom. But it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea.",

In terms of community feeling, its really up to the individual themselves, there are often events so I guess you could meet people there, but its not like other residential halls where you\u2019re practically forced to meet people. Lemme know if you have any questions",

How often are they and are they much of an opportunity to meet new people? \n\nCurrently LK is my best option since I will have to pay for my own accommodation and its pricing is a bit nicer in comparison to some other places. Plus the kitchenette and the bathroom in each room sounds great. \n\nAt the moment I just want to know every little reason why I shouldn\u2019t choose it so that I can make a good decision.",

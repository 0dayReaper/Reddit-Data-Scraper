I\u2019ve been attending heaps of social events within the lodge but tbh I haven\u2019t found anyone that I really click with - and LK is pretty deserted. At this point I\u2019ve honestly started freaking out that I\u2019ll never make friends so hey if anyone is in the same boat just dm me :)",

Otherwise, don't worry, there are plenty of icebreaker activities during your first tutes and lectures when classes start. Just give it some time! :)",

Thank you so much!",

And you will have to keep reaching out, but it is worth it to have those people in your life. Just keep showing up, saying hi to the familiar (and unfamiliar) faces, and go from there",

Most people haven\u2019t been on campus at all yet bc they live off campus so you\u2019ll have a pool of non-ressie people to befriend, as well as people in your courses etc. I know lodge is a bit different to other halls but maybe try do the inter hall arts/sports stuff and get involved in that side of things. IAC (interhall arts committee) and ISO (interhall sports organisation) are both great places to meet more people (full disclosure here I\u2019m on IAC and live it and have been in ISO in the past), and also just people within unilodge on the whole. Also join a club! Do a revue or something or just join a society or something that does weekly meetings and find people that way, but you have heaps of options. What you put in is what you\u2019ll get out of friends at uni so don\u2019t give up yet! Keep putting in the effort to meet new people, apply for stuff, become a course rep, put yourself out there, chat to people in tutes or actively sit try and sit near-ish to people in lectures so you can chat to them, ask for help or offer help. You\u2019ll get there and find your crowd eventually - I promise \ud83d\ude42",

I have contacted the administrations office, but was wondering if anybody has/had a similar problem to me?\n\nCheers",

Don't quote me on this because I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure one of the criteria for direct applications is that you need to be completing your Year 12 or IB studies within Australia, which possibly explains why they have specified that you need to be part of the November graduating cohort.\n\nStudent Central will be able to give you a definite answer as to whether that is the case.\n\nGood luck with your application!",

A lot of International Relations grads work in positions where you need to be a citizen.\n\nHaving said that, there are plenty of jobs where 'has a degree' matters more than the specific qualification. An IR degree will tick that box, but I wouldn't recommend it on that basis unless you're very passionate about studying IR.",

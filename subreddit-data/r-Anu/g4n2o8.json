Also I plan on studying law and environment &amp; sustainability if that\u2019s at all relevant.",

Yes, there are some minor problems (far less than most of the other colleges), but we've done a pretty fucking good job at building a great, tight-knit community with a really strong in-hall culture. \n\nThe actual facilities here are definitely some of the best looking on campus, and 99% of the people you meet here are hella wholesome or just super fun to be around (don't worry, the other 1% keep to the shadows). And in this particularly tough time with so many lockdown laws in place, Wamburun has done a fantastic job at keeping the remaining community together, while the other ressies here have been coming up with online events to keep the fun rolling. \n\nRooms are decently big, kitchen is a nice space, quad is always pumping (maybe not right now), nest has got a good view, decent quality pool and table tennis tables, and the best goddamn receptionist in the goddamn universe.\n\nRent is obviously a big factor for most, but we are one the cheapest halls on campus (top 3 I think), but we're definitely Number 1 for value. clean and modern toilets, showers, and rooms, TV's already installed in each room, plus it's one of the best looking buildings at ANU.\n\nNot sure if you can tell, but I definitely have a little bit of a bias. That said, I guarantee you ask any ressie here and they'll sell the place like Phil Swift sells FlexTape.\n\n  \n\n\n.....oh, did I mention we're the only undergrads with double beds?",

Every bedroom on all 5 floors of short wing has a double bed, and all but about 10 rooms on each floor of long wing have doubles too. And as someone who copped a king single last year (still bigger than a normal single), I can confirm it's not actually that bad. That said, you'll likely cop a double, the single rooms typically go to any postgrads",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a new student starting my first year at ANU this semester. Though I have applied for accommodation back in November last year, I have yet to receive an offer for accommodation (my application is still pending as 'Application Received'). \n\nIs anybody experiencing the same issue? I'm kinda worried since it's less than two weeks till the expected arrival date (though I believe that accommodation is guaranteed for first year students).\n\nThanks all!",

I'm currently employed with a full-time job, and well, need to continue to be employed to support myself and the family.\n\nDoes any of you have experience doing both at the same time? Have you done part-time? How hectic is it?\n\nThanks in advance for any answers.",

A few of my classmates dropped down to part time study before the census date as the combined pressure of work/uni/family was just not realistic (understandably). \n\nI think it\u2019s also worth considering what your goals are at uni - are you happy with credits or are you aiming for distinctions and high distinctions? That should help you figure out how many hours you can put into uni.",

That equates to two courses, right?\n\nDo you know if the classes are all mandatory to attend in person? Are there any night classes? Weekends? \n\nI've heard also the remote/online is an option for at least semester 1- any experience on that?",

I believe most schools will stay online or at least offer remote options into next semester. We did not have many night class options although it\u2019s worth emailing your head of school directly to find out before you make any decisions!",

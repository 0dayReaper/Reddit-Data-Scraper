    "postText": "Hello, Does anyone know how WD (Withdrawal Without Failure) grades are perceived? I want to do honours after my degree and further postgraduate research study, but I now have a couple of WD grades on my transcript. They don't count towards my GPA or anything, so they haven't brought my marks down. But I'm worried how bad WD grades look on transcripts. Does anyone have any insight?\n\nThank you very much for your help!",

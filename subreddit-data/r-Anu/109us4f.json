    "postText": "Hey everyone, im a graduating with a Bs in Electrical engineering from oversea. I want to change to Computer science and move to australia so im planning on studying Ms in computing at ANU. I have some questions i would like to ask:\n\n1. Is getting this degree good for software engineering jobs ?\n\n2.Is there any prerequisite subjects i need to take before enrolling ?\n\n3. Should i maybe look at other uni like adelaide, uts ,\u2026 (i heard that anu is more focused on research instead of for jobs ) ?\n\n Thanks for reading this. Please excuse my writting, its my 2nd language :))",

Schools like UNSW or UTS seems hard to get in already and doesn\u2019t give out that much scholarships :(",

What are the academic and social cultures like at ANU?\n\nPlease answer as you feel capable.\n\nI appreciate your time!",

The nightlife is there if you go looking for it, and the culture feels nice. ANU students I\u2019ve met like to talk Canberra down and complain here and there, but I think that\u2019s something people do no matter where they live. I really truly like it",

It is not a big city so if you want that \"big city excitement\" then Canberra may not be it for you, but you get all the perks of a big city (food, culture etc) but the peak hour traffic lasts 15 minutes and there is an incredible amount of nature around for walks and other activities that are much harder to do somewhere like Sydney and Melbourne. I had a really good experience overall at ANU and found that the culture is generally pretty welcoming and accepting, you study hard but you should have heaps of time to do fun things you enjoy :)",

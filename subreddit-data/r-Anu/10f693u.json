    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m curious as to how much students in Canberra spend per month (excluding rent). I\u2019ve budgeted to spend around $500 per month but I\u2019m not sure if that would be able to cover groceries, food, leisure, etc. Would anyone be able to advise me on whether this is enough or should I budget for more? Thanks!",

            "comment": "living fairly comfortably (cooking nice-ish meals for myself, eating out one/twice a week), I'd say I spend about 600 dollars a month. That's including things like public transport &amp; the occasional 3 pack of socks &amp; the like. I do drink alcohol and coffee semi-regularly. Just be sure to budget for a big initial move-in shopping trip (to buy things like oil, spices, pots and pans etc.)",

The main reason I was able to do this is I cooked really great meals and bought groceries: I rarely ate out because I didn't have the time and ensured my meals were high quality. I also don't drink alcohol or coffee. If you are planning to eat out 1-2+ times a week, or drink coffee alcohol it's probably going to be much higher",

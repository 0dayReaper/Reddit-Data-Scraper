    "postText": "I've got an offer to study Masters in Astronomy and Astrophysics from Australian National university. However I haven't received any scholarship for the same.(I have applied for the MSc. in Astrophysics scholarship but I'm not too sure if I'll get it. Also it's just 5000 AUD per semester) \n\n Is the course worth it? \n\nAnd since it is one year of coursework and one year research work, do students get paid in their second year for research?\n\nThanks in advance!",

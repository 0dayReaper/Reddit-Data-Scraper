    "postText": "Hi all.\n\nI've accepted a PPE offer at ANU to start in February and still no accommodation offer. Although technically I am a domestic student, I currently living back home out of Australia so flights and plans have to be made which is making this a bigger and bigger problem.\n\nI submitted my accommodation application way back in September so I thought I should have definitely heard back from them by now. I applied for Bruce and Wright as top choices.\n\nIs anyone else in the same boat and is there anything I should do about it? Like emailing uni accoms ( [uni.accom@anu.edu.au](mailto:uni.accom@anu.edu.au) )?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Got an offer from Yukeembruk, the new massive on-campus accommodation, and well... kind of wanted catered for the first semester at least while I figure out my courses and work load.

I believe they only started the accommodation offers for applications through the star-rez portal yesterday, so we should hopefully get out offers within the next few days. If you don't get anything by Friday I would probably email uni accom, they usually take about a day or two to respond from experience. Also, slightly curious how you applied for both Bruce and Wright, thought we only got one preference?",

    "postText": "I know that ANU has access to this journal \"[Law Society of South Australia](https://search.informit.org/journal/bullsa)\". I am based in Europe and unfortunately my university does not have access to this journal. I am looking specifically for this paper:\n\n**Davies, P. (2005). Parliamentary privileges. Bulletin (Law Society of South Australia), 27(5), 18\u201320.**\n\nLink: [https://search.informit.org/doi/10.3316/IELAPA.200508465](https://search.informit.org/doi/10.3316/IELAPA.200508465)\n\nTried asking on [r/scholar](https://www.reddit.com/r/scholar/) already but no luck. I also could not identify the author, as \"Paula Davies\" is a common name. Can someone be kind enough to obtain this papers and pm me?\n\nThanks in advance to whoever can help me!",

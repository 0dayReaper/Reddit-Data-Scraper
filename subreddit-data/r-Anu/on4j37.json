    "postText": "Hello there,\n\nI am currently finishing up my master's at UNSW and might be interested in applying for a Phd at ANU. \n\nDoes anyone know what types of scholarships, top ups, and other financial support are available for phd students. From my understanding, the stipend is around 28k (tax free - which is similar to UNSW). I found some information about supplementary scholarships but it would be very helpful if someone with experience can chime in. Also, I read that you could work for maximum of 10 hours/week, does anyone know how much do they pay tutors? \n\nI already secured a job for 2022, so I just want to compare the overall financial support/salary I could get for a phd vs my post-tax salary.\n\nFinally, I know that Canberra is cheaper and maybe less interesting than Sydney but what are the living expenses (generally speaking) and how bad/good is the social/nightlife?\n\nI really appreciate any input. \n\nCheers!",

            "comment": "There are standard top-up scholarships (~8k/year last I knew) awarded automatically to the strongest applications, but also you could be offered a top-up by a particular research group or partner institution (amount varies).\n\nTutoring is definitely a great way to supplement your income - casual rate is currently $48/hr: https://services.anu.edu.au/human-resources/salaries-benefits/academic-casual-sessional-rates\n\nSince the scholarships are tax free, tutoring income should stay under the tax free threshold.\n\nLiving expenses depends on your standards - you can get a room in a sharehouse near ANU for $200/week, but if you want a studio apartment you're probably looking at more like $400. Maybe check out Graduate House - it's not the nicest building but you can get a studio for $300/week last I knew.\n\nOther expenses are probably pretty comparable to Sydney.",

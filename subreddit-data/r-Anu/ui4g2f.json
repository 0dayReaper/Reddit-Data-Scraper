    "postText": "i got an offer for bachelor of science from ANU today. I know that ANU is second in australia when it comes to comp science and it ranks 27th in the world as well but i\u2019m not sure whether the internships are great.\nanyone with advice pls help! thank you so much. \n\np/s: im an international student and havent been to australia b4, let alone canberra.  I applied and got accepted to other top 8 unis (except for UofMelb who rejected me and i didnt apply for UNSW) so ive been considering other unis as well but so far i have been leaning towards ANU. However there r lots of things i dont know abt ANU comp science so im scared of making rash decisions in accepting their offer. i would appreciate it if anyone can tell me more abt ANU cs. Thank you!",

If you want to be a run of the mill Java/C# developer where you can get a job anywhere, I wouldn\u2019t bother. I feel like ANU\u2019s broad range of courses is what\u2019s allowed me to end up in many interesting jobs since graduating. Canberra is also a great place to live, but I\u2019m from Canberra so can\u2019t comment too much on what it\u2019s like for someone coming from overseas. r/Canberra is a good place to ask about what it\u2019s like to live here.",

            "comment": "I agree with the other post. Only having some CS electives under my belt, I cant say too much. From what I have heard from CS majors, the program is really good. As for Canberra and ANU in general; you should note that they are quite small. ANU\u2019s under grad population is about 10 K. Usyd for example has a population greater than 3 times this. This small size is good for having a closer nit community and relatively small class sizes, however the clubs and societies scene is pretty small. In addition, some specialisations within your major may not be offered. You should check this before you enroll. The other thing to remember is that transferring between unis is not hard. If you get in to CS here at ANU but find there is a specialisation that they don\u2019t offer, you can transfer easily.",

Go to usyd or uts or wherever you got into - i\u2019d recommend anywhere that is the cheapest - but not ANU. The courses are so poorly managed, there are not enough tutors, but more importantly, most of the jobs here requires background checks, which means you should be a citizen here or have a PR. I do love living in Canberra, but i don\u2019t enjoy at all studying compsci in ANU",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, hoping someone can help me out with this situation. I'm currently having 2 problems with my conditional offer. \n\n1. I submitted my final transcript (which I was supposed to do before 31 Dec), and the admissions office has just told me I need a degree certificate too (assuming they meant a completion letter). However, my current university has informed me they would only be releasing these in late Jan 2023. Is it possible for me to just use my final transcript (obtained from my current uni through MyEquals) as evidence that I've finished my degree? \n2. I need to submit a screening and vaccination booklet as part of the offer too (this is due on 30 Jan). Everything else is fine except I need to take 2 boosters for varicella. I took my first booster on 9 Dec, and the second one is supposed to be on 20 Jan. I would only be able to take another blood test for this 4-6 weeks after the second booster. Can I just submit evidence for the boosters as part of my vaccination requirements? \n\nI'm so stressed about this so any help is appreciated. Thanks!",

I completed an honours degree and the USYD website specifically says that courses with honours would take a longer time to receive a completion letter. I have put in a request to get it sooner but I haven't received any response yet.",

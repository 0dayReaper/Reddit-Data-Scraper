    "postText": "I received an early entry offer for commerce at anu, but i forgot to add law on the application form since at the time i thought it was impossible, so I put lower atar requirement courses.\n\nHowever it turned out my year 11 results yielded me a 98.5 selection rank, which would have made me into double law. \n\nI am currently doing really shit in year 12 and think my hsc isn't going too well. If I were to accept the commerce offer, and try transfer into a law/commerce double degree, what are the expected scores and how long will it take? (eg. 1st year comm result sacrifices one year of my studies.)",

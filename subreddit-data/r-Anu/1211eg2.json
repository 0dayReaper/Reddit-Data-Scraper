I mean as a prerequisite -- knowledge you'd need already\\* to take the course.\n\nThinking of enrolling next semester and wondering what I need to learn/revise. Thanks! :)\n\n\\*Including things covered in the course but quickly enough that realistically you'd need to already have a decent grasp of them.",

            "comment": "The maths isn't difficult at all. Really, it's high school level math. Some double summations in there, but you aren't expected to know difficult algebra. There's zero calculus. \n\nI did it last semester and smashed the assignment portion (HD) but then flunked the exam. Watch out for the exam. Gen (who I assume will be teaching it next semester, as he did mine) will give you 4 practice exams and say that you should be able to complete them in the time alotted. Each prac exam should take 3 hours to complete, and the exam is 2 hours, so really the exam is like a truncated version of the practice exams. I didn't attempt two questions due to running out of time, so they really design the exam to test your ability to answer the questions swiftly.",

Sounds like this subject will be a good way to get back into formally studying maths-related topics. Thanks for the insights.",

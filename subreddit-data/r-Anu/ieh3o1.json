But definitely give them a call to check! \n\nIf you're looking for a quiet and studious environment I recommend Lena Karmel lodge. It's not a party college/lodge like some of the others, and it was always quiet and chill while I lived there. But might not be the best place to make friends because most people keep to themselves. I've heard Warrumbul lodge is similar. \n\nShare housing could also be a good option! Much cheaper than student accommodation",

    "postText": "As a 3rd year I am happy to share my humble, subjective, not-at-all authoritative conclusions about the vibes and merits and deficiencies of each ANU study space:\n\n**Chifley:** Floor 1 is for people who are only half-studying and would rather be on TikTok. Avoid. Floor 2 is okay, this is kind of the bread and butter study space of campus. Librarians here are the nicest of all. Really helpful. Floor 4 is really where its at. Only the most dedicated go here. Dead silent. Massive collection of books. Nice views. Best rooms.\n\n**Hancock:** Hit or miss. The  vibes can be way off, with yelling ex-private school rugby boys decking the halls, or it can be extremely monastic and studious. Floor 3 tends to be better. Hancock's  Basement is ANUs best kept secret study space. I won't give directions to it because I like how empty it usually is. \n\n**Marie Reay:** Do NOT come here if you want to actually  get anything done. This is the temple of distraction. Fumes of share-house concocted microwave food, heaps of bustle , tutes pouring in and out constantly, mostly 1st years everywhere. Not ideal. \n\n**Menzies:** Serene, poised, classical. Pretty small though. Upper floors are a bit ugly. Hard work is done in Menzies though. It closes at 5 however which is pretty lame to be honest.\n\n**Research school of social sciences:** really intimidatingly pretty. being around all the academics will inspire you to work hard. difficult to get a seat sometimes. \n\n**Biology building:** really nice arcitecture and some cute little nooks. theres a piano though and the postgrads like to play it. this is fair becuase its their building but it can be hard getting anything done with fur elise blasting in the background.\n\n**Llewelyn Hall:** go to the top floor near the cafe. Incredible study space. very very beautiful and spacious with views of whole campus. Usually empty. Be warned: music students are afoot\n\n**Law library:** never been because law students give me palpitations and I don't like to associate with those people. Not prejudiced, theyre just smarter than me and it hurts my ego :/",

            "comment": "&gt; law students give me palpitations\n\nAs a law student, agreed.\n\nMy thoughts are though that it's really good for heavy study; clean, comfortable, and generally almost silent. Very small though so can be hard to find a seat at peak periods.\n\nBroadly agree with everything else except that Chifley is a 0/10 and I never go there if I can help it.",

            "comment": "Nothing on the art &amp; music library? \n\nIt's small size and location must be hiding it from those who never trespass into the domain of the visual arts students. \n\nThat said, no reason to really come here unless you are said art or music student. Comfy, warm and welcoming but very limited seats and hours. \nPerfect place for art students needing last minute printing to pad out their visual diaries or refuge from the cold halls of a 1940s era building.",

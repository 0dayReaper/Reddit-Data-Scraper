    "postText": "Hey! I got accepted into a Bachelor of International Relations thanks to the early admissions (I'm planning on deferring for a year if that's possible). I spent around half of my life in Tuggeranong, so getting familiar with a new city isn't the issue. I currently live in North Queensland and I'm worried about transitioning back to a larger city, especially dealing with the higher cost of living and being unable to share common ground with other students. Will there be any support to make the transition easier?",

Luckily Canberra is very small/chill compared to most other major cities - and, if you live on campus, you will have no trouble getting to know other students. I def. have no expertise on this but hope it gives you some peace of mind!",

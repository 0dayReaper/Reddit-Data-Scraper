I don't have any experience with either degrees but from reading other posts about PPE and double degrees I think it's generally recommended that you double with something interdisciplinary. As in PPE and Criminology are both social sciences, maybe you wanna try criminology with only economics instead to give you a quantitative edge? ANU is great for economics (while PPE has a bad rep here onreddit) and I believe it gives you more specialisation than a fancy yet vague PPE degree:) Personally, I'm looking at combinations between Public Policy and Economics or Law at ANU. Hope this helps.",

I have many friends who have done a double degree of psychology and criminology, both of which are social sciences but also synergise well. I think the things to consider are what your interests are and what could potentially complement the other degree.\n\n  \nI would also support the idea of specialising rather than doing PPE. Most people usually dislike one of the subjects, whether it is politics, philosophy or economics, and ultimately you graduate as a jack of all trades and master of none. That's just my opinion though - you can always specialise later down the track with a masters.",

It's a common misconception that they have different workloads, but the double degree is more about which units you take rather than how many units you take at a given time. Whether in a double degree or single degree, a full-time student takes 4 units per semester, but in a double degree you sacrifice some of your electives and add an extra year in order to gain another degree in another area.",

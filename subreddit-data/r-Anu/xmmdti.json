    "postText": "Hi! I have planned to apply to ANU in the future and had a few questions that I hope can be answered!\n\n- when applying for a Flexible Double, do you receive a Bachelor of A and a Bachelor of B upon graduation or do you graduate with a Flexible Double?\n\n- what accommodations have your best recommendations and why?, and\n\n- what shops and cafes nearby (in walkable distance) are the cheapest/best to use?!\n\nThankyou so much! I appreciate any information! \ud83d\ude03",

Otherwise, the halls of residences typically are catered.\n* There\u2019s a couple of cafes on campus that serve great coffee (but not sure if this has changed after the Kambri project) - one near the ANU gym and one in Union Court. Back in 2017, a cup of coffee costed roughly $3 (not sure what\u2019s the price now with the effect of high inflation).\n\nHope that helps.",

    "postText": "I am currently holding both UNSW Computer Science offers and ANU Bachelor of IT offers. I have done CIE A-levels and am an international student going to Australia for the first time. Therefore, the location would not be a major factor to consider unless I need to do an intern.\n\nI am having a hard time picking between these two offers. Both of them seems to be similar but different. I would be glad to hear any sort of opinion from someone who has done this course.",

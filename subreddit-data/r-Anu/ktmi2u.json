I'm from victoria so I'm trying to decide between monash, melbourne or anu (I'd have to move to canberra but that's alright). \n\nAlso, I've heard of the PhB program - is it worth it? What other experiences are there if you're looking to get into research?",

The physics department from my first year experience has been great though. Can speak past that since I\u2019m just starting my second year.",

I went to Clayton some time back in the Cretaceous period (I\u2019m 42, undergrad) and it wasn\u2019t a good fit for me, though I suspect I also wasn\u2019t a good fit for much back then. Certainly I\u2019m enjoying every aspect of it more this time than last time.",

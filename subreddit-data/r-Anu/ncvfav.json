Whom is looking for someone with a Bachelor of Philosophy anyway?\n\nhttps://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/aphsc\n\n&gt; Employment Opportunities\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of our graduates have used the PhB program as a pathway to completing PhDs in some of the best universities around the world, such as Cambridge, Oxford, Yale, UC Berkley and, of course, ANU.\n&gt; \n&gt; The PhB can also provide a pathway to the Doctor of Medicine and Surgery (MChD) without having to sit the GAMSAT. Each year, 10 places are reserved in our medicine program for students who successfully graduate from the PhB program and undertake a successful interview.\n\nEven the website doesnt actually say there are any employment opportunities available, its just a stepping stone for further research",

Like maybe if you wanted to go into working in the public sector or for a tech company etc. I know there are degrees more suited for those fields, but I was under the impression you don\u2019t need those degrees to get your foot in the door",

If you do a PhB majoring in chemistry you have a chemistry degree and that's all that matters to someone hiring a chemist. There is some recognition of the PhB within Australian academia, but obviously none overseas. Even within the academic research track that the PhB is intended for, the associated scholarship is more prestigious than the name itself.",

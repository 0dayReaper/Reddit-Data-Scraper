It was also a very enjoyable course - Adam is great!\n\n There are not many options for first-year COMP courses anyways. So I don't see the harm in taking another math course. If you are math-inclined, you could take MATH2222 instead of MATH1005. I have not taken the course myself, but I have been told that it is extremely challenging and rewarding. \n\nHope this helps!",

            "comment": "I believe math1005 occasionally appears as a pre req in later 2000/3000 level courses (especially AI/ML/Systems courses). I do believe that it's content and focus is fundamentally different to 1013 so take it if you want to follow the COMP Sci major. For reference: BIT (soon to be BCOMP) lists 1005 as mandatory, while you don't even need to take 1013",

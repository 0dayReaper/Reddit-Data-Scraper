    "postText": "My sister is an EE major and earlier mentioned her interest in investing in a mechanical keyboard. I want to gift her a Keychron K8 and a similarly priced mouse. I\u2019m planning on going for non hot swappable blue switches (don\u2019t really know what non hot swappable means, it\u2019s just the option that confuses me less \ud83d\ude05). Blue switches are better for typists I\u2019ve heard, but are loud but that shouldn\u2019t be a problem as she has her own bedroom in unilodge. Firstly I\u2019d like some mouse suggestions around the 50USD mark, and secondly I\u2019d like to know the logistics behind carrying this out. Here are some of my priorities, and my situation as well. \n\n1) I wish to keep it as a surprise \n2) I\u2019ll be ordering and paying from the US, please recommend which Australian retailer (other than the obvious Amazon) would you recommend ordering from \n3) i want the items to be delivered to her in the same package, if not atleast the same delivery. Really don\u2019t want two deliveries, ruins the surprise of the gift imo.\n\nAlso I\u2019m really sorry if this is the wrong sub",

They're responsible for the residents on their floor and usually more than happy to help with this kinda stuff.   \n\n\nI hope this helps. Cheers :)",

I recommend getting hot swappable one in case she\u2019s latter. \n\nAs far as retailers go I can only think of two places which sell both mouse and keyboard. Mwave and Amazon.",

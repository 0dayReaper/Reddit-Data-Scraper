    "postText": "I'm a new undergrad student and i'm currently enrolling into my courses. I'm confused why there is an \"Autumn session\", and a\"Winter session\". What is the difference between these sessions and my semesters? Do i have to enrol for these sessions?\n\nAlso, do you guys normally enrol for both semesters simultaneously or just one semester at a time??\n\nThanks, cheers!",

These exist so that people can choose to fast-track their progress through their degree by doing extra course load instead of taking holidays. You know, lunatics :-)\nPerhaps these are also available so people can repeat a unit if they fail something, so they don\u2019t fall behind their cohort.\nNot sure how everyone else handles enrolment, but I only do one semester at a time.",

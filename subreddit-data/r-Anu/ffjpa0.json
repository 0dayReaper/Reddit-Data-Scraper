It is an older building, but I found the college atmosphere to be the best of the non-catered colleges.\n\nWhen I went there, it has the most eclectic group of people, as it was cheap, self-catered and on campus (at the time I think it may have been the only such option) - and so it attracted all the short-term exchange students, which was really fun.\n\nAlso had an artsy and sub-culture vibe",

            "comment": "Hey OP, I'm a current Wright resident, and if you're at all interested in making your own food, the flexi-catered system will likely not work out for you. There is one kitchen area that is barely functional, and the purpose of providing only 16 meals is more about people sleeping through meals or skipping lunch than it is about allowing residents to cook for themselves. \n\nThat aside, Wright is a great place to live, but maybe not what you're looking for in terms of catering. If you're interested in a fully self-catered experience, Fenner or Burton &amp; Garran Hall are the way to go. \n\nFeel free to PM me if you've got any other questions!",

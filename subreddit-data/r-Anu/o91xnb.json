    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI want to enrol in the diploma of languages, but can it be enrolled as a stand alone course or do I have to do a degree there to be enrolled? Also what if my ATAR is lower then the 80 ATAR that is needed? Do I still have a chance of getting in or should I not apply at all.\n\nThank you :)",

Also you\u2019re prolly not gonna get in with an atar below the required but you may as well apply since with the covid situation they aren\u2019t getting as many students as expected so they might let you in. \n\nApplying through the UAC costs around $70 in admin but I recommend it cuz it handles everything for you and lets you easily apply for multiple unis.",

Ik I wasn\u2019t when I was applying. You can always apply to other unis at the same time and accept the one you want and decline the others. \n\nDon\u2019t tell anyone I said this but UC (uni of Canberra) is a decent regional uni and has very low ATAR requirements (50-60).",

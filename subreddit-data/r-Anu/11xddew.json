    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am considering coming to ANU for exchange, and would like to ask about the following\n\n1. How easy / difficult is it for exchange students to get housing on campus? I am hoping to stay at any of the UniLodges, preferably a single studio.\n2. What is the student demographic like in the social sciences? e.g. International Relations, Global Security, Development Studies, Anthropology, Sociology\n3. How rigorous are your classes? (e.g. how many hours do you spend doing readings and class preparation, and class itself)\n\nThank you!",

India, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia figure highly. Also possible- from a lot of other places. Pre-covid international students made up 2/3 or more of some student acommodation colleges; and at least 1/3 of all students.\n\nEDIT: I'm not sure if it's true or not but pre- COVID a Europen friend commented they were surprised so many \"Asians\" (he meant Asian looking people of all sorts regardless of international student or Australian) were here. Well we are in the middle of Asia not some other place there have been many successfully immigrants to Australia through the whole of short recorded history when Europeans (also immigrants) have been here. So particularly if you come from Scandinavia or something it may be a thing you notice.",

    "postText": "Hi all. I'm an international student who will be starting my Masters program in Science Communication next year. I was wondering if anyone had experience getting work on or around campus, especially folks on a visa since it only allows us to work 20hrs/week. In my undergrad, I did a work study on campus and I would love to work on campus again if that's an option at ANU.",

I've also seen the academic skills centre (and specifically the writing centre) looking for people to do regular casual work. Could suit as a scicom master's student! I don't know how best to find those jobs, but worst case scenario emailing them to check could be worth it.",

Rod Lavers who runs SCOM1001 is often looking for tutors and other SCOM courses will probably be looking for tutors and markers. Its very good pay and usually only as many hours as you want. Lots of other places on campus are often looking for workers for example there is the phone call donations program that hires every year. If you keep a look out there should be lots of opportunities. You can also register yourself here [https://www.anu.edu.au/jobs/casual-employment-for-job-seekers](https://www.anu.edu.au/jobs/casual-employment-for-job-seekers) which might be helpful.",

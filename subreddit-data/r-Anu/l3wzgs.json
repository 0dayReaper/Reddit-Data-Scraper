I even heard the news that one of them fc the security guard during isolation. Why cant we uni students get back earlier? We come and make consumption of Australian products. We help revive Australian economics. Tell me why cant we get back until 2022? Yes, I apologize for my inappropriate words. But I wanna know YYYYYyyyy",

    "postText": "Heya, so I got accepted for early entry into b/econ and ANU gave me a selection rank of 94.3. I would've liked to have gotten into b/laws and econ instead, but I put it as my second preference and econ as my first because I was worried that I wouldn't be able to get in, so I'm going to change my preferences. I know ANU will compare my selection rank and final atar when it comes out to make the final decision but I just wanted to know in advanced if a 94.3 selection rank is good enough? Because law is a 98 atar (I think), and I know it's a very competitive course as well, so I'm not sure if it'll be good enough. Also, I am in no way getting an atar in the 90s and I'll be lucky to get a mid-80 atar, so I'm pretty much relying on my SR to get me through. \n\nI'm asking in advanced because I got accepted into b/laws, econ and finance and b/laws and arts at UoW and I'm a bit torn between where to go, and if I'm correct, I'll only have like 1 day to decide my final uni preference. I know that even if I don't get into b/laws and econ at ANU straight away I can still try and transfer in my second year, but I'm just worried because of the grades and competitiveness of the course. \n\ntldr: Will a selection rank of 94.3 get me into b/laws and econ?\n\n(lmao sorry if this sounds stupid I'm bad at explaining and worry over everything)",

            "comment": "No, the listed 97 requirement on the ANU website means you must achieve that as a SR. The only way would be if you got 3 extra adjustment point, but even then it is unlikely as it seems to be quite competitive.",

            "comment": "I know a lot of people who transferred into high ATAR programs their second year, it\u2019s 100% doable if you hit the ground running in your first year. Anecdotally, I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s easier to transfer in partway through than it is to start there from the beginning, I have a few friends that did their first year at different schools and transferred in too.\n\nAlso keep in mind re:competition, the fact that you\u2019re coming in during COVID means much fewer international students are coming in and programmes are less competitive as a result. I\u2019ve also heard, anecdotally, that people get accepted to programmes with ATARs as much as 5 points below the advertised cutoff due to vacancies even before COVID.",

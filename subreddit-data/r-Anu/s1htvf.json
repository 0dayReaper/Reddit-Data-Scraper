    "postText": "Is there anyone who is pursuing masters in International Relations at Australian National University? I would like to know about your experience and how competitive was the application process for you? I got in but didn't get any scholarship. I have reapplied. \nAnd what level of employment opportunities it opens for international students?\nAlso, I want to take up an exchange semester in Europe. How does that work? Do I need to indicate it before hand or can I apply for an exchange programme once I start studying?\nThank you!",

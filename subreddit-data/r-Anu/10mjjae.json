I can only find 6 and not really sure what I should be doing because of this. Any help would be appreciated!\n\nCheers",

            "comment": "Hey, congrats on your entry at ANU! \n\nThis depends on the FDD. What degrees are you undertaking? Furthermore, how evenly split are the 6 courses throughout the year? Is it 3 for each semester? ANU counts 3 to 4 courses per semester as full time, so even if you did 3 you would be counted as such.\n\nHave a look at what second year courses are available and if there are pre-requisites for that - I will note that this would have to probably be for non core courses (compulsory) and I do not recommend doing this, more like as a last resort. Ultimately it depends on how much work you're willing to put in and if you're confident to throw yourself into the (mildly) deep end in your first semester.\n\nI would otherwise suggest you go on a part time load, assuming you're not on a scholarship or agreement that requires you to be full time. You can take the time to work, or find an internship in second semester.\n\nKeep in mind that first year does not mean that you need to do all 1000 level courses - obviously it depends on the courses but for me (BINSS) I did 1000 and 2000 level courses in my first year. I'm not sure about STEM subjects but for some areas it could be a bit like that.",

There\u2019s also an optional minor for the BINSS and I would be up to 8 1000 level courses if I did that but to my knowledge it isn\u2019t compulsory, but I guess maybe it is then? I\u2019m not sure. It definitely doesn\u2019t say I have to do it from what I can see.\n\nWhen you say first year means you have to do all 1000 level courses, does that mean all compulsory 1000 level courses or all available ones? Can I just move on to 2000 level courses once all the compulsory 1000 level courses are done or is there a minimum amount I have to do regardless?\n\nFrom what I can see across the FDD there are 5x compulsory 1000 level courses for me, and 1 optional one and so I\u2019m currently enrolled in 2 of them in semester 1 and 3 for semester 2.",

It will be a mix of 1000, 2000 and 3000 courses. \n\n&gt;When you say first year means you have to do all 1000 level courses, does that mean all compulsory 1000 level courses or all available ones?

If you want to get all of your 1000 courses done in your first year (depending on if they are available), then you are welcome to do so. However, you do have a cap on the amount of 1000 level courses that you can do due to how easy they are compared to 2000 and 3000 level courses. For BINSS, this will be 'A maximum of 60 units may come from completion of 1000-level courses' - assuming the 1000 courses you take give you 6 units each (some at ANU give you 12 but for BINSS that is rare) you will only be able to do 10 1000 level courses. I would strongly encourage you to check for BPPOL, as well as if that changed for FDD. For this, the CAP Student Services will be able to help you on this one.\n\nI should clarify that you are not obliged to do all 1000 level courses in your first year. It is usually encouraged for students to at least do the 1000 level compulsory ones as they tend to be pre-requisites for either other compulsory courses or courses that you might find interesting. If you already have some 2000 and 3000 courses that you are interested in, it would be a good move to start planning a little bit in terms of seeing when they are available and what the pre-requisites are (if any).\n\nIf you're a bit hesitant on doing a 2000 level course but don't have enough 1000 level ones for the year, try out a 2000 in your second semester and see how it goes. Due to COVID, STST2001 was running in the second semester of my first year, and since STST1001 and 1003 had somehow both run in semester 1, I was able to take it (despite being advised not to do so) and did pretty well in it. It's all about how confident you feel about tackling it. \n\nProbanly should give you this advice since I wish I had gotten it, but it's not a race. I transferred from a BINSS, to a FDD in BINSS/BPLSC last year to back to a BINSS this year and wished I had looked at my degree plan and how everything was going to play out if I decided to transfer. Do give yourself some leeway in terms of credits, you never know what is going to happen. Also, ANU gives you the opportunity to go on exchange from your second year. If that's something that you are interested in, do leave some credits in your degree. Universities usually ask for 24, but check with ANU Global Programs. Luckily I knew I already wanted to do one so I left a gap in my program but once the year kicks off and people are choosing their courses they forget that they need to set credits aside.\n\nI understand that BPPL has some courses in common with BPLSC (students from those degrees usually shared a lot of classes - 4 of your 6 core courses are in the BPLSC degree), so feel free to shoot me a PM if you have a question one of them or if you have questions about BINSS. \n\nFor BPPL, concentrate on doing well in POLS1009 - this will be probably rather boring but will give you the tolls to understand later content like in POLS2044 (not compulsory for BPPL) or any course that involves polsci methods. \n\nThis might have been a bit of a ramble, so I do apologise but don't hesitate to shoot me a DM or if you have any significant admin questions, contact CAP or CASS. In my experience CAP will be a lot more efficient in dealing with student enquiries although this might due to its much smaller size as a college, so for BPPL enquiries you might need to wait more as well as go through the whole bureaucratic machine (just think of it as training for POLS2009).  Make the most of the services the univeristy can give you in advising you with your degree! The ANU student discord can also be pretty useful too.",

Just be sure to email the convenor of each course to see if its first year friendly. The first year course caps are also changed in a FDD. Its 'A maximum of 36 units may come from completion of 1000-level courses' on both sides of the degree and a single course can only count towards one side.",

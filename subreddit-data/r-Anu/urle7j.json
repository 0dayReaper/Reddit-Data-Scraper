    "postText": "I'm applying for the PhB - Humanities and Social Science, and I need to \"provide details of any relevant experience or study\" in my application. Does anyone know what kind of experience or study they'd be looking for? Obviously being in high school I haven't really had the chance to do any high-level research, but things like general employment wouldn't really be useful, I imagine.\n\nThanks!",

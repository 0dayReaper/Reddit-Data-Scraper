Im considering the option of taking Bachelors in IT(majoring data science/software dev/cybersecurity) and Bachelors of Finance(major in quantitative analysis), so i was wondering how are the quality of these courses and also job prospects in canberra as I have heard it is harder to find a job in canberra(more government ones?) and also get PR in australia ? Thanks in advance!!",

I have seen a table(forgot the name) under visa 189 which had like job titles that are in demand, im guessing i gotta refer to this table?",

It really wasn\u2019t for me because it went far beyond the skill set that economists need, but it was fascinating for the students who are into that type of thing. \n\nI believe the quality of ANU courses to be very good - lots of students move here from Sydney and Melbourne to study.",

But having been here for a year now I\u2019ve realised that people just like to complain about whatever situation they\u2019re in. I\u2019m sure USyd students complain about their courses just as much as ANU ones. Either way, there\u2019s tons of international students here, and this part of Canberra has gained a real \u2018university town\u2019 vibe, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019d really like it here.",

Yeah it is harder to find internships than it is for domestic students but not impossible, you\u2019ll just have to spend more time researching which places dont need the security clearance.",

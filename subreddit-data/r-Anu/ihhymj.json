    "postText": "Hey everyone\n\nThinking about transferring to ANU internationally from Semester 1 (or 2, given light of the situation we're in) , 2021. I'm interested in pursuing a LLB/BSc, however I'm not sure how cross-crediting works for the Law department (it was a bit confusing having the customer rep lady explain it to me over the phone.) Just wondering if anyone has successfully cross-credited any of their law (or other faculty papers) having come from a non-Australian university and how difficult the process was.\n\nCheers.",

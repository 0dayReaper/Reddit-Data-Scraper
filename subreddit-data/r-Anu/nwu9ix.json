    "postText": "So I've had a pretty unpleasant experience with applying to ANU as an (postgrad) international student. Everything has been super slow, I'm kept out of the loop, and even though borders are closed, deferrals have to be 'assessed' and take much longer than the usual timeframe. Inquiries  take up to 10 days for a reply. Is the admission usually this unresponsive or is it the pandemic? I've read some complaints before on this.\n\nI've been asking myself if it's all worth it, it's been a year now in the process and I feel like I've been wasting too much time. Will borders even be open by early 2022?",

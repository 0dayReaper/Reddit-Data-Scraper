            "comment": "&gt; How is the program? What we learn in the courses, how relevant is it to building projects?\n\nYou learn theoretical and some practical CS. It really depends on what courses you choose.\n\nUniversity is about learning the fundamentals of CS/software engineering. \n\n&gt; How relevant is it to the industry?\n\nTheoretical CS is not really related to industry. You will find this the same at the majority of other univerisities. \n\nThe TechLauncher courses are related to building actual software which will be related to industry if you wanted to take that. \n\n&gt; Do everyone in this course know how to code beforehand? I am not much into self learning..\n\nNo. You should note that self-learning is very important for any engineer. After you graduate and enter industry, you will need to continuously learn new technologies and best practices for software engineering.\n\n&gt; how are the internship opportunities?\n\nIf you are an international student it may be difficult to find an internship due to visa issues. \n\nOtherwise, there are opportunities available if you look for them. Being in Canberra doesn't help too much as many tech companies only visit universities in Sydney, for example.\n\n&gt; Do we have to learn skills outside from the courses to get a good grad job? I will put all my efforts in the courses but how relevant is it to the industry..\n\nYou should learn skills outside the class if you want to get a good job. This is the same at any university. \n\nYou may have heard that people have side projects - this is important to demonstrate your competence and that you actually know how to code.",

            "comment": "When I was hiring software devs .. I tended to whittle the pile down first by asking : Do they have a plausible degree with some math/science content ? .. then what projects did they do on the side ?  \n\nCapable developers will invariably have a couple of projects up on github, and I would browse their code.\n\nSo.. I highly recommend learning the fundamental theory at uni AND doing practical programming projects in addition - even if its a mini game or animation in javascript or python.\n\nAll the best devs Ive worked with have done a lot of self-learning / self-driven side projects... if you like to build things in software you will have done that, if you dont.. it may not be the right career choice ?\n\n\nIf you have done a degree and are job-hunting, I would look at the job descriptions.. see what tech they mention - eg javascript/node.js or react or postgresql or numpy - then I would spend a couple weeks studying that tech and making a side project as evidence that I know it .. then apply.\n\nI once read a job description that asked for 10 yrs experience in node.js .. when node.js was only 7 years old.. so take it with a grain of salt.  otoh. make sure you can do the stuff before applying, ideally provide evidence.\n\nbest of luck with your studies and future career !",

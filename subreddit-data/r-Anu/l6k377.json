            "comment": "hey so usually its per course and first or second week of semester. once you enrol i think this year is 8th feb, the course will show up on your wattle. wattle contains all your course info, lectures etc and the info on tutorials will be posted there. it is usually done where the link to register the tute opens on a certain day + time and its first in first served so tute spaces can run out quickly (esp in first year courses). idk if this is confusing so:\n\n- 8th feb (i think): wattle \u201copens\u201d with your enrolled courses\n- wattle has a link to tutorial registration (each course has its own link), link usually opens first or second week of semester \n- choose your tutorial\n\nDM me for any other questions if you need im in my sixth year \nalso if anyone else has any less complicated way of explaining pls do",

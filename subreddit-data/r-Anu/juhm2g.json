    "postText": "Hi! I'll be part of the class of 2021 and I'm looking at applying for ANU for the PPE and maybe PPE/Laws but I wanted some opinions on a few topics before I seriously consider it. \n\n1. I just know I won't be able to afford a college accommodation (300 a week?!), so is there any sort of alternative accommodation I should be looking at?\n2. Has anyone transferred from a Sydney university? Is ANU that much better?\n3. Am I at a disadvantage if I am away form the opportunities that Sydney unis can offer? I guess for my course I'll be near Parliament...\n\nThanks yall :)",

I just changed my preferences in UAC and took a later round offer for second semester. ANU Economics is unmatched in Australia (maybe UQ is comparable). \n3. Doesn\u2019t matter where you live. When you go for a grad job, the recruiters don\u2019t care where you\u2019re based, only that you\u2019re prepared to move if required. Being from Sydney, you just apply for Summer internships in Sydney and Canberra. \n\nI am doing econ honours next year.",

Most of the chemical engineering positions I see advertised want a \"Bachelor of Chemical Engineering\" like UNSW offers:  \n[https://www.unsw.edu.au/study/undergraduate/bachelor-of-engineering-honours-chemical?studentType=Domestic](https://www.unsw.edu.au/study/undergraduate/bachelor-of-engineering-honours-chemical?studentType=Domestic)  \n\n\nIf you're in doubt, I would contact the School of Engineering at ANU and see what they say.",

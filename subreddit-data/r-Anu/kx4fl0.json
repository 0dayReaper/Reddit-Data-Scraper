    "postText": "Hi, so I am going to be relocating from Western Australia to Canberra to stud at ANU. I have a vague idea of what I\u2019d like to pursue. I have been offered a spot doing a Bachelor of Arts yet have to chose my course . I know I want to get into politics somehow. I was thinking of doing a double major in Political Science and a international Relations yet I also want to do German culture and language as a course. \n\nI want to help forge in countries with policies and human rights issues. Am I choosing the right courses? Is there any advice anyone could give as to what would be the best choice for what I\u2019d like to pursue? \n\nThank you!",

    "postText": "I'm an international student and I took my bachelor degree, BSc Mathematics in the UK early this year. My knowledge of Computer Science is next to nothing but since I don't want to do pure math anymore and I'm still considering doing a PhD in the future, not necessarily in Australia, I want to transfer to another program.\n\nI was first admitted by Master of Statistics, but now I've noticed it is possible for me to do CS master degree at ANU. I'm planning to transfer to one of the two programs mentioned above in my second semester. \n\nHere is the question. Which program is more suitable for me to start from a math student to a CS student?",

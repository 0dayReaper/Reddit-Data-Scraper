There's a handful of decent electives you can do through PPE as well, but most are fairly... meh. Some excellent lecturers though, I saw another post here mentioned Bronwyn and I second that, I'd also add Katie Steele and Lachlan Walmsley into the mix as a brilliant lecturer and tutor respectively.",

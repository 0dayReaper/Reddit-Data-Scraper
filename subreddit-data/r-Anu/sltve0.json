    "postText": "Hey guys, I am a first year student this year and i\u2019m hoping someone can please answer these questions for me?\n\n1. Do you have to enrol in the exact tutorial/lectures you want to attend,  because I noticed there\u2019s multiple time slots for the same tutorial (as in they cover the same content)?\n\n2. What are the dates for each break? the uni calendar is so confusing!\n\n3. is O week important?\n\nThank you so much!",

            "comment": "1. Depends on the lecturer. Some insist on attendance in the tutorial that you put down, others are more flexible. \n\n2. Sem 1 classes run 21/2/22 - 27/5/25, exams start 2/6/22 and finish, at latest, 18/6/22. \n\n3. Depends. Some days, like market day, help to get a good survey of the clubs and societies the uni has to offer, and some good social events. If you aren\u2019t interested in those aspects of uni life, then likely not.",

            "comment": "1. Best way to keep up to date about tutorials is to constantly check the wattle pages. Each lecturer will have different sign up times, info and way of doing it. \n\n2. Answered above \n\n3. Really depends on what you want to get out of uni. There are some helpful seminars like time management and research papers. Market day is definitely a good one to check out. If you\u2019re down to meet new people I recommend going to any events you find interesting and just having some fun :) \n\nAlso if you\u2019re on campus check if your accommodation has any events, they can be a funky way to meet people in your residence. (If you\u2019re in unilodge you might see me around)",

            "comment": "If you are starting at a college I would say O-week is pretty important. Not only is it a great opportunity to make friends, get familiar with Canberra and the ANU campus if you have only just moved here, and have some fun before the stress of classes start, but the senior residents of your college run some important information sessions that establish what sort of support is available to you, what sort of behaviour is acceptable etc. As a past senior resident I did notice that students tended to have a harder time making friends at their college if they missed o-week. Hope this helps!",

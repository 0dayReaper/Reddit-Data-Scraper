    "postText": "Hi! I'm a student at bocconi university in milan italy, still considering whether or not I should go on a study abroad to the ANU, in Canberra. I'm a pretty social person who enjoys meeting new people. I enjoy some nightlife but I'm not a party monster at all. I have 24 hours to decide whether or not I should go, so I would like you to tell me what you think. I'm a bit scared of the 30 hours flight, and heard that Canberra is very boring and lifeless. I also heard that ANU only has 50% student satisfaction... \n\nis it easy to make friends?",

I think any travel will broaden your horizons, but think about what you want.  30 hours is long but time will pass anyway I'd think about the cost more than the time.",

I would think of it more as a regional town than a city per se. It's certainly not \"lifeless\" but it is a much smaller place than Sydney or Melbourne, for example. If you'd prefer the hustle and bustle of a big city, maybe look into exchange opportunities in those places.",

            "comment": "I would recommend coming to ANU for an exchange. The university is really excellent in terms of academics and students hail from all over Australia/internationally which is an interesting characteristic of ANU compared to other Australian universities. The fact that most students are not local to Canberra gives the uni a really social atmosphere -not necessarily big on partying per se- but I\u2019ve found that students in general are more open to making friends because they are not coming in with a big group of high school friends (that was way more common at Melbourne Uni where I did my undergrad - also extremely prestigious uni with good academics, but I found a key difference was students might be more cliquey there). So despite the somewhat subpar reputation of Canberra as a \u2018boring\u2019 city, actually campus life at ANU is a lot more livelier than other Australian unis in my personal experience - especially at night when more ANU students live on campus compared to in Melbourne for example.\n\nThere\u2019s also nothing stopping you from taking trips to Sydney and Melbourne on the weekends which are more quintessential Aussie experiences with more touristy things to see and stuff going on. Flights are reasonably priced if you book early enough and there\u2019s also cheap coaches going to Sydney.",

Either Melbourne or Sydney.\n\nAnd remember that unis in these cities are commuter schools, so the culture can be a bit of a shock if you're used to studying at a residential university. To get the best experience really throw yourself into student clubs and societies as much as possible. Seek help from the student union to help you get the best experience. You gotta be proactive, rather than passively waiting for fun to come to you.\n\nANU is more of a residential uni, but canberra is a small, expensive city filled with public servants. For a student looking for fun and diverse experiences, go with one of the big state capitals.",

Unfortunately a lot of students who live on campus never make it out to explore, which I feel like is a big part of the issue. Public transport is functional, but a bit slow, which I think puts people off. Befriend someone with a car or buy a cheap shitbox when you get here.\n\nCanberra has the highest number of restaurants per capita, everyone is super educated, high percentage of uni students and foreign visitors/immigrants, pretty much completely fuelled by green energy, big cycling community, running community, dancing community and a bunch of awesome venues for music and shows.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t sound great, also remember Canberra is only 2 hours from the jaw-droppingly beautiful Jervis Bay, 3 hours from Sydney, 3 hours from the snowy mountains and Kosciusko, and it is in the bush surrounded by national park. \n\nYou won\u2019t be bored if you put in the effort, but even if you are bored of Canberra the ANU is a fantastic place to study with a beautiful campus. You\u2019ll have fun, I promise. It\u2019s nothing like Milan, I\u2019ll say that \ud83d\ude0e",

However, I do not go to clubs every week because I don't like drinking much haha. And that totally works for me! I was never pressured to go outside my comfort zone to meet people and was able to make amazing friendships regardless. As others mentioned, some people love going out every weekend, but there are many others that aren't as active and that's totally fine as well. I was able to make some great friendships last year just by putting myself out there. I talked a lot while cooking, shared kitchens are always a great place to meet people and make new friends. \n\nI also went to events on campus, there are lots of fun things to do. On top of my mind are: gardening, arts and crafts, social sports, drama, TV, radio, media, clubs and so much more. Again, I know so many people who are super engaged in clubs and societies but I was still able to have so much fun without having to join or be active in clubs. Sometimes club events are open to the public and free, definitely take advantage of those. Back to making and building, there is Makerspace on campus and they have many activities going on through the semester. \n\nThe city also has been getting livelier. I am a huge fan of city festivals and events as such - Canberra has quite a few going on. Some events I have been to are the Multicultural festival, Enlighten, Night Markets, Floriade (my friends had been, it wasn't so fun but oh well haha). Coming up are the National Folk Festival and Innovation Festival. I'd say do not count on these festivals as huge events, but probably a nice and different thing to do during the weekend. \n\nI wish I could engage more in what's happening around me, but I study comp sci at uni. As a result, sometimes, I am really stuck in the libraries or at home working on them. ANU is the only higher ed experience that I have so far, but I think academics is quite intense and if you are determined to do extremely well here, sometimes, you might have to make a compromise between fun stuff and studies. However, if your grades do not get transferred to your home uni, by all means, get involved as much as you can.\n\nThere are also some nice hiking spots in Canberra. I have previously been to Black Mountain (which I consider is on campus because it is so close to where I stay), and Mt Ainslie. There are many other great places to explore in and around Canberra. You could also go on a few days' trips to Melbourne and Sydney. I saw someone else shared their perspective on that - and their answer was quite comprehensive, so I will not touch on that.\n\nA friend of mine who was doing her exchange here last semester did the Australian National Internships Program (ANIP) for 12 credits. She enjoyed it thoroughly and I thought of bringing it up just in case you would be interested in it as well.\n\nFinally, I have had a lot of friends who came here on exchange. Many of them admitted that ANU was not their first choice, and neither were they so keen on Canberra. But having lived here for 4 or so months, all of them had agreed that it was one of the best experiences they had.",

I didn\u2019t know much about Canberra before going, and I wouldn\u2019t have even looked there if I didn\u2019t have any other choice, but I would do it again in a heartbeat. \n\nAlso people at ANU are from all over the country, not many people are from there originally, and they all go back to their home cities in holidays. If you get the chance to stay after your semester exchange, this means you can go visit them all in different areas and get the best tips of where to visit. \n\nIf you have already decided, I hope you chose to go!",

Canberra is also very large, as big as a European city but without the infrastructure. without a car, your gonna be sitting on buses for hours.\n\nCanberra is a great place for hikes if you like going bush but you'll need a car.\n\nI never studied at the anu but its a nice place. if you come in the winter expect it to be as cold as a Milano winter without the snow. Sydney, an interesting place in aus, is 3 hour's drive away and is the closest city by far, the train takes 5 hours.\n\nI've travelled Aus - Europe many times, you can get the total travel time down to about 24 hours (by paying more) and if you are over 25 it's worth the money to do so. 30 hours on a plane/airport is not fun and gets worse the older you get.",

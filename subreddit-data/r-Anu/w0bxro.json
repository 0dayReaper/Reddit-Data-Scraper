Is it worth it for international students like me in respect to jobs etc? \n(I would consider a job in finance, be it in Australia or outside Australia. Just wanted to know whether I'm doing the right thing)",

Or do you want to work in consulting? Study economics.\n\nWant to instead work in corporate finance, such as working in an accounting department (where you can get a CPA license), or work in financial advising (where you can get a financial planning license), then you would want to study finance and choose the appropriate subjects. \n\nYou may also be able to study a double degree, if you would want to pursue that option.",

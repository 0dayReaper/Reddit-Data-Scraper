    "postText": "I was accepted to ANU recently to a bachelor of science adv honors program, planning on majoring astrophysics. I was pretty sure that along with offer I\u2019ll get a scholarship (cause my selection rank was 99/99,5). However didn\u2019t receive any scholarship, especially that chancellor\u2019s one. Is there anyone who received any scholarships? I\u2019m also interested about those who got chancellor\u2019s scholarship. Current international students, if you\u2019re are from low income family and can\u2019t afford anu education, how are you paying tuition fees? I really want to attend anu, but I simply don\u2019t have money, pls give some advice!!!",

Many science/health related honours thesis have partial scholarships to cover living costs - on the scholarships page I linked above look at the \"Honours\" Study level to reveal a list of them :) Hope this helps!",

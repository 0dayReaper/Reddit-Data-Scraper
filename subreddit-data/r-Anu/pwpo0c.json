If you're ready to begin then I wouldn't allow your concern over remote research stop you. \n\nUnless as you say it's essential for your field, but I can't really tell specifically what you're doing until you reveal it. Maybe that might clarify the situation more.",

Personally, I always recommend living on-campus in your first year of Uni, you get to meet lots of new people and you are close to campus facilities, which helps for longer/overnight experiments. I suspect that next year things will open up a lot more so remote work would be less likely. To be honest, I strongly recommend contacting your supervisor or your Research School and ask if they can refer you to someone who has been in your situation and can provide better insight. I hope this helps!",

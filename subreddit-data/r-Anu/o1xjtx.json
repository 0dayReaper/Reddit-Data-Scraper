I'd also love to hear from anyone else that has done the transfer as well and their process.",

            "comment": "I transferred to law after a year and have found it a really great experience. Law courses do often require more work than other courses in my experience but if you\u2019re on top of the readings, go to lectures and go to tutorials, you should have no issues. I\u2019m still able to maintain a good uni life balance pretty well (except during exams)",

            "comment": "I transferred from PPE into a double PPE/Law. It\u2019s an increase in workload, but as above, if you are able to stay on top of your readings and think you may have an interest in law it\u2019s worth a go. The process of transfer itself was easy; apply, wait, accept and transfer your previous course credits over (if applicable)",

As for costs, that sadly comes with the territory in law. It\u2019s an expensive degree, which sucks, and I know I\u2019m not looking forward to paying off my HECS. As for time requirements I\u2019m not certain, however I\u2019d say it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019d let you transfer to a double mid semester on pure practicality grounds, i.e. you won\u2019t be able to pick up a course 6 weeks into sem. I suggest you get in touch with student services, they\u2019re great at helping plan out degrees and giving you pathways to follow, good luck!",

There's a space for each course.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ouehyoj1s7481.png?width=1720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8a10da6458f85a246c3cdefa82890c8e40e15774",

                            "comment": "Hello!\n\nI do have a few impressions after using the website that I\u2019d like to share. :) First, I like the design, although I haven\u2019t done much in UX - so take my opinion with a grain of salt - I think the website has a clean design and isn\u2019t overwhelming to use. One thing that I\u2019d like to be added to the website is a calendar that members could add events to. It would be so nice and convenient if events across all clubs and the Uni could be found at a centralised location. To ensure that the events are genuine and not the result of someone trolling, fb/ uni links could be added as descriptions to the event. Otherwise, users could submit a club-related event which can be reviewed by the mods before publishing that event onto the calendar. More work, but more secure.\n\nAbout the interface, it would be nice if we could type the specific course code instead of having to scroll through the huge list when I click New Post &gt; huge dropdown. Some courses seem to not follow the order, for instance, RUSS1004 and RUSS1003. RUSS1004 comes before RUSS1003 in the dropdown although it\u2019s a higher-level course. I'm planning to take Russian during my time at Uni, that's why this caught my eye. :)\n\nDoes the system also check in the students database when someone registers with a uID? Haven\u2019t tried it but a person not affiliated with ANU could easily access the forums if there\u2019s no check. I understand if this isn\u2019t an immediate necessity/ if it isn\u2019t tricky to implement a check program due to privacy reasons, but if your intention is to build an ANU students-only community, it would kinda defeat the purpose IMO.\n\nLastly, not sure if it\u2019s just me but I cannot access your website using the link in the post. I need to remove the [www](http://www). from the url for it to work. You might want to check if others have been facing this issue as well.\n\nI would be happy to help with this if there are any relevant opportunities. :)",

It really means a lot.\n\nMy numbering below corresponds to each paragraph you raised.\n\n1) I would love to add events/webinars straight from the platform, it is something I have in mind however as the amount of users is very small at the moment my immediate efforts are on actually getting people on board to discuss things. As /if stuvoo grows I'd love for the platform to be more sophisticated and meet various social needs. Thank you for validating that this would indeed be useful.  \n\n\n2) Noted! I will fix this.  \n3) We are not linked to the ANU database as this is not an ANU-owned platform. I intend on adding an email confirmation that way you can only log in once you have verified your email via your ANU inbox. Hopefully, this will address the issue. I did have this initially but wasn't sure if the confirmation link was working as there was no way for me to personally check. :(  \n4) Thank you for raising this, I will look into it!  \n\n\nDo you mind emailing [hello@stuvoo.com](mailto:hello@stuvoo.com), I'd love to have a Zoom call with you. :)",

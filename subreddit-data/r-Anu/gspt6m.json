    "postText": "Hey all!\n\nI'm looking to study a double degree in International Relations and Security Studies next year here, but I can't find anywhere that states how much this will cost me, or explains clearly how I can work it out. As you may be able to tell from this post, math is by no means my forte, so I find myself completely lost. \n\nWould anyone here be able to give me an estimation of the annual cost? Or direct me to a place that explains how to calculate my tuition?\n\nThanks!",

The International Security degree is covered by 144 units worth of classes (36 subjects), each having their own tuition value. If you want to see the cost for the class, pick a subject from the BINSS list and then select the \u2018fees\u2019 tab. That\u2019ll give you a rough estimate of the total price per subject. \n\nIf you\u2019re a domestic student, you\u2019ll be eligible for HECS and the government would cover your tuition fees, in which you\u2019ll pay over time when you start earning an income.\n\nThe \u2018fees\u2019 tab has a domestic and international tab, so that\u2019s how you\u2019ll see the cost.",

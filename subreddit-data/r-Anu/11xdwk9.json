    "postText": "First question is self explanatory.\n\nBut my second one, I'm doing IB tryna apply for LLB early entry (because why not). My year 11 grades amount to 35, except my coordinator hasnt given any TOK/EE grade, so theoretically this could be 37/38 depending on how well i do. First, ik that this isnt really up to scratch for an LLB but I'm gonna apply regardless. Second, am I supposed to include a TOK grade? Or will ANU figure out that TOK is subject to change and factor this in. I say this because my results from year 11 only add up to 35 without considering a potential tok grade.\n\nLet me know thanks in advance",

I\u2019d speak to your coordinator and explain the situation, because everyone else doing the IB in your school would be in the same boat. If the coordinator won\u2019t do anything, make it as clear as you possibly can in your application that your predicted grade doesn\u2019t include TOK/EE. Absolutely DO NOT hope that the Uni will realise that for themselves",

Consider looking into any adjustment factors that may be applicable to you and that can bump up your grade. Regardless, it\u2019s worth applying even if your grades aren\u2019t quite there yet, you can always transfer in to law (which is easier to do within the same uni than between unis).",

    "postText": "# What's Going On?\n\nA recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader to Sync.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the [old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com) desktop interface .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What's The Plan?\n\nOn June 12th, many subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe two-day blackout isn't the goal, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you wish to still talk about ANU please come join us on the Discord ([https://discord.gg/GwtFCap](https://discord.gg/GwtFCap)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUs moderators all use third party reddit apps, removing access will harm our ability to moderate this community, even if you don't see it there are actions taken every week to remove bots and clean up posts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What can you do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComplain. Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a support request: comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as this one, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpread the word. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord \\- but please don't pester mods you don't know by simply spamming their modmail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't be a jerk. As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.",

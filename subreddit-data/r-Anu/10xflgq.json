    "postText": "Hey guys, I was booking my classes on the MyTimetable website. The courses I'm taking this semester are COMP1130, COMP1730, MATH1115, and PHYS1101. The problems I'm having is the fact that I can't do my Physics practical on any day without a clash. Also, there are two more clashes: one with COMP1130 and COMP1730, and one with MATH1115 and COMP1130. I don't know how to resolve these clashes. How should I resolve timetable clashes?\n\nShould I drop COMP1730 as I'm already taking COMP 1130? How do people take 4 courses a semester without clashes?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9bxkj9422ha1.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c6d2888c581fe48e16b3bde991a269fe1f192006",

Typically attendance is not necessary (unless specified as assessed) so pick one to go to and watch the recording for the other one later. \n\nIf it's two practicals/compulsory classes clashing (e.g. tutes) and you missed signing up for your preferred time you can speak to your course convenor to be placed in another time block.\n\nLooks like your prac is only clashing with a lecture as is. So you'll just have to attend the prac and watch the lecture recording instead.\n\nIts somewhat impossible to avoid clashes when you've got multiple classes and long sessions involved.",

I didn't know all lectures are recorded, but now that I do I'm relieved. Is clashing like this normal or is it a bit too much? Also is 4 classes a semester overkill? Is it difficult to manage?",

There are definitely more challenging data science courses like comp2420 or comp2400 that you may end up doing anyway.\n\nIf you just want easy maybe math1013 instead of math1115, or comp1100 instead of comp1130 might make more sense? I think you can always drop down during the semester though.\n\nAlso you could always do comp1730 in a later semester if it's clashing?",

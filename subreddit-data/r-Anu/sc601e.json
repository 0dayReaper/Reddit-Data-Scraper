I accepted my offer yesterday but still haven't heard a single thing about accommodation. \nI'm concerned I won't have anywhere to live if I don't hear anything. \n\nI also tried contacting them via email (Unilodge) two weeks ago and never heard anything back so don't know whether they bookmarked it or not. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

If you\u2019ve accepted your offer on the ANU application, then I think that means you have a place and that they should send you that email soon. If not, the deadline for acceptance and fee payments is 31 January, so you\u2019ve still got time.",

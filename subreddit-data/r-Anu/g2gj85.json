There are plenty of people who got put in a different college to the one they applied for, but for the most part people go where they've asked to go. \n\nAnother thing to note is that once you're at college, the preference you had just sort of goes away, and it becomes less about the building itself and more about the people you meet.",

I\u2019ve heard really good things from friends about Ursies in particular in terms of being a good catered college specifically. If you have Q\u2019s about the colleges in terms of cultural differences between each I\u2019m happy to answer \ud83d\ude42",

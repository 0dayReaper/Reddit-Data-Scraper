I'm starting to doubt if this is a good combination since my friends have better combinations (e.g law/commerce, econ/ir etc). I'm thinking of dropping commerce after this semester depending on how my grades are. What are your thoughts? Should I continue doing a double degree or should I drop commerce?\n\nAnd before you ask, yes I will talk to student services at cbe after I finish my exams.",

Also the biggest issue I have is the wait time between appointments. Especially near exam time. But I would still recommend trying it.",

If you think you need to speak with someone, then the best option is to book it in and do that: if you're on the fence, worst that can happen is you have a chat. I only ever had very positive, constructive working relationships with my counsellors at the ANU. \n\nANU Counselling still lists \"Next Day Appointments\" they're shorter, but with a little persistence you could speak to someone in the coming days. I'd recommend calling them pretty early once they're open to enquire about one of these on  02 6178 0455. You'd get a chance to sus out quickly whether a longer course of counselling is best.\n\nDepending on the nature of what you'd like to discuss (and if you're perhaps unsure of the best counsellor to see) you could make an appointment with a Student Advisor at ANUSA. They are NOT counsellors, but it's a free, confidential service and they are familiar with all the counsellors (Emily, one of the advisors, is particularly across ANU Counselling services). You would also be able to speak to a Student Advisor relatively quickly and they can advise you of options available to you (even academic support you should avail yourself of if you need).\n\nAll the best!",

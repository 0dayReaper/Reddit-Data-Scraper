            "comment": "Hi there, \n\nThe ANU has a few different support paths. Some are formally managed by the anu (access and inclusion is the main university contact for students with disabilities to receive an educational access plan for learning accomodations (extra exam time, easier extensions, note taker, etc). \n\nThere is also a strong presence of student let support. The student Union has an autonomous students department (the disabilities student association (DSA)). I volunteered with this group this year, and they basically host various different (autonomous) social events and are a point of contact if you have a bad experience with your disability at any point during the anu. They can refer you to different services etc. we have a Facebook page (ANU Disabilities Students Association) &amp; a group (won\u2019t share it here, but similar sort of name). You can ask questions, &amp; for help in the group etc. it\u2019s autonomous and has current and past students. There\u2019s also an ADHD collective &amp; a mental health collective. There is an ASD group as well, but it\u2019s a bit dead (lots of us just use the main group, we make up a good majority of conditions (and ADHD is quite common too). You can join these groups before you come (I\u2019m admin and can accept you). \n\n\nIf you\u2019re on campus, each res hall has its own student rep body, and each hall has an officer dedicated to disability/wellbeing matters. these are great if you\u2019re having issues living wise. \n\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not perfect, but if you need to reach out for help / support, there are access points available.",

Have a look in the groups section and you should fine the Facebook group. \n\nThere\u2019s no membership fee or anything, all autonomous members are automatically members",

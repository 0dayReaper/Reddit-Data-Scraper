I\u2019d go with what content your prefer the look of. \n\nIn terms of which one runs better, they\u2019re first year courses, and first year courses are universally hard to run due to class sizes. We had so many admin issues in intro to politics, but amazing tutors who worked to keep things as fair as possible. These things naturally happen in large class sizes/courses. So I\u2019d only go with the content/assessment format you like the look of more (altho assessment in first year courses tends to be similar)",

    "postText": "I'm the writer of [the Hype Train](https://www.hypetrainnews.com/) \\- an Australian finance and business newsletter written for university students. \n\nThe aim is to provide interesting Australian finance news in 5 minutes or less along with some links to cool stock research I find online and hot-takes. \n\nBeing a graduate and university tutor in Finance/ Economics I see the value for this newsletter to university students to (1) keep on top of business news in a casual format and (2) start getting some basic insights into different companies, valuation methods, and other finance concepts early on. I would have really wanted something like this at university when I was a student, which is my motivation for starting this in the first place.\n\nIf anyone is interested you can subscribe at [https://thehypetrain.substack.com/subscribe](https://thehypetrain.substack.com/subscribe), or you can view past editions [here](https://www.hypetrainnews.com/). \n\nOn this note, if anyone has any questions about finance/ management consulting/ data analytics careers or general uni advice PM on Reddit and I'll try my best to answer anything!\n\nCheers and sorry for the plug... *it'll be worth your time (if anything for the interesting read).*",

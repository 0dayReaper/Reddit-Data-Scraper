    "postText": "Hey guys I'm doing some recreational map work and I wanted to see if any of you guys would mind sharing the SVG on this page:\n\nhttps://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/mapsonline/base-maps/pacific-eez-zones-ll\n\nhttps://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/mapsonline/base-maps/pacific-eez-zones\n\nAn SVG is just a different type of image format like a PNG except it has layers and vectors so it is easy to edit the text unlike a PNG where you can't click on the text to edit it. [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Australia_with_AAT_(orthographic_projection).svg You can see the difference here if you click the main image it is SVG but PNG image is down the bottom]\n\nIf one of you guys could share the SVGs with me I'd be very grateful. Appreciate it thanks",

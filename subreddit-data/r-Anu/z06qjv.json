    "postText": "Hello, I am a student looking forward to applying for a degree in Computer Science. I want to get into research, specifically Artificial Intelligence. I used the ANU degree builder and now I am confused between  Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Research and Development)(Honours) and Bachelor of Science (Advance)(Honors).   \nI feel that a BSc might give me better exposure to other sciences so I could look into the possible applications of AI. But I am extremely confused between the 2 can someone help?",

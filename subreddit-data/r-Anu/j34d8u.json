    "postText": "I got early entry into the BACR&amp;DH for 2021 and it sounds like a great course, but I just want to have an idea of how difficult it is to maintain the 80% required to stay in the course.\n\n\"Students must maintain a minimum 80% weighted average mark across all courses that contribute to the final Honours grade calculation in order to continue in the Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Research and Development) (Honours).\u00a0Students who do not maintain a minimum of 80% weighted average mark will be transferred to the Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Honours) single degree.\"\n\nI also noticed that anything above 80% is considered a HD by ANU, which makes me think it's pretty tough. I have no trouble getting 80% at high school level, but I really have no frame of reference to decide whether this is doable at uni, or whether the stress would be too much.",

They didn't work at the same time though and consistently spent at least 6 hours a day doing uni work 7 days a week. Thats 6 hours not including procrastination but effective study (watching lectures, doing all problem sets, catching up on readings).\n\nAlso, its not particularly stressful because you can always transfer into the normal stream if it becomes too much, no one will view you differently.",

I assume that since you were able to get into R&amp;D that you have a good work ethic.\n\nIf you get under 80% average for a semester it's fine. You're given the chance to improve. \n\nThe most important grade is your overall honours score which is based mostly off your honours thesis but also your course grades. This must be above 80% otherwise you do not get to graduate with a R&amp;D degree.\n\nI did BAC R&amp;D and averaged around 90% over my whole degree. I didn't do much studying or work unless I had exams or assignments, so my workload was pretty manageable",

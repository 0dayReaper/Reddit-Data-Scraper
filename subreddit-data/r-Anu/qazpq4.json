    "postText": "Hey I'm currently completing the HSC and am wanting do do a double degree at ANU. I think I'm going to do arts majoring in sociology and a psychology degree however I'm a little confused (and regretting not going for early entry)\n\nWhat is the difference between a bachelor of science (psychology), a bachelor of arts majoring in psychology or a bachelor of psychology (honours) or any other at ANU?\n\nThank you so much :)",

            "comment": "**Disclaimer:** this info is based on my own experience, which is from a few years ago. I'd be surprised if it's changed much, but please **check the ANU website** too.\n\nWhen I did a Bachelor of Science (Psychology) a few years ago, there wasn't a huge difference between that degree and a Bachelor of Psychology (Honours). Back then, the Bachelor of Psychology (Honours) assumed you were going to do the standard three years plus an honours year - this requires you to maintain a certain average grade, but means you are automatically offered a spot in the honours program (I think). You can get into the honours program after completing the standard Bachelor of Science (Psychology), but the admission process is competitive, and therefore depends on your cohort and the number of BPsych (Honours) students. I believe the same process applies to arts students who major in psychology. The required grade for students to be accepted into the program this way is, on average, lower than the grades that BPsych (Honours) students have to maintain, but this can vary, in theory.\n\nBoth BSc and BPsych are \"science degrees\", and may require you to do some science courses (although these can be psychology courses, rather than other sciences). They are run by the College of Health and Medicine, whereas a Bachelor of Arts would be coordinated by the College of Arts and Social Sciences. \n\nYou might want to consider how the degree will look on your CV - is a Bachelor of Arts more relevant to your career goals, or would a Bachelor of Science be more useful? Tbh, I've found my Bachelor of Science (Psychology) pretty versatile, allows you to consider job applications to graduate programs that specify science graduates.",

I think I'll probably do the latter then just due to guaranteed entry to the honours program rather than hoping I get in later.\n\nCheers!",

Views are totally my own but I honestly recommend contacting ANU Science to follow up with this (they'll know specifics or redirect you to the go-to person). Here's a link: https://science.anu.edu.au/contacts/future-students-enquiries. Best of luck! :)",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI\u2019m a new student moving to Canberra from Vic, and I\u2019ve got one or two simple questions.\n\nFirstly, what are the costs of keeping a car with you in Canberra? Is it even worth it with all the great bike riding opportunities?\n\nFinally, when is a good time to move out there after the 1st of Feb? I\u2019ve got money to make down here until O week, so I\u2019d probably not want to move in on the 1st. \n\nThanks.\n\n:)",

            "comment": "In terms of costs of keeping a car with you, assuming you\u2019re living on campus (college), you\u2019d be paying ANU for a parking permit [fees for parking on anu](https://services.anu.edu.au/campus-environment/transport-parking/parking-options-on-acton-campus). Then there\u2019s petrol. I personally found myself using the car only when i know I was buying more things than I could carry, but most of the time, the city centre is a 10 min bike ride away. It\u2019s generally really easy to get anywhere in the city from uni - especially with the introduction of electric scooters. \n\nIn terms of moving down, colleges usually have M &amp; N week - 2 weeks before \u2018O\u2019 week. I\u2019d encourage you to go then instead of right before O Week starts as it gives you a chance to settle into uni and make some friends within college before the hustle and bustle of O week.",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nFor some reasons I will leave the States and go to ANU to study actuary and then come back so I need your advice on degrees that help me the most to prepare for SoA exams.\n\nI am torn between bachelor of Actuarial Sciences and Bechelor of Science (major in Mathematics). My friends at ANU told me that I should study Bachelor of Actuarial Sciences rather than Bachelor of Science major in Mathematics as it won\u2019t help me to self-study and pass the exams of SOA. \n\nWhich degree do you guys think I should opt for? Any advice is much appreciated.\n\nThank you xoxo",

            "comment": "The ANU actuarial science degree prepares you for the Australian set of Actuarial exams. This will be different from those in the states. If your intended path is to qualify as an actuary, studying actuarial science here may be challenging as you either have to relearn stuff for the American system, or qualify as an actuary here then convert when you go back. Both of these are time consuming. The Maths program will be a bit more general in terms of career. You can still become an actuary either by working for a firm or competing a postgraduate degree. Either way, the end goal is to complete your exams and become certified in your intended place of work. \n\nSo really, unless you are going to work as an actuary here in Australia, both options will involve a fair amount of self study and time commitment.",

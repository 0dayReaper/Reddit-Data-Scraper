I'm a 2nd year law student and every job I've seen advertised requires you to be in your second year AT LEAST (and have prior office experience, etc etc) . The only people I know who got paralegal jobs as a first year happened to know someone in the firm or something along those lines. Hope this helps! Also very happy to answer/give advice on any other law qu's!",

I got a job at a firm at the end of first year, but that isn't super common.\n\nIt's a better idea to either go all out for study or do customer service roles (which is the main reason why people in earlier years get jobs similar to the one you're looking for)",

    "postText": "Questions about which uni to go\n\nI\u2019m just about to finish my bachelor degree at unimelb(actuarial science). \n\nAnd I have recently received offer(master of actuarial studies) from ANU, and the program is 2 year, but after contact with school, they can offer 24 units of credits, so the program could be shorten to 1.5 years, but I may still need 2 years to complete due to the course limits it can not be completed in 3 consecutive semesters. \n\nAnd the other option I got is to continue my master degree at unimelb. It\u2019s a 1.5 year program, and through the practice pathway we will do 3 research projects that relates to the the real life problem of insurance which is really attracting me.(I do not know if ANU offer this kind of projects as well)\n\nAnd other background is that: \n1, I got my rent contract in Melbourne for another 9 months. \n2, My friends are in Melbourne. But they may leave in July 2023. And I know nobody in ANU.\n3, I have almost no internship experience, so I wanna take the 2 years in ANU to find have some internship, to build up my experience.(it will be semesters that I do not have a full time load)\n4, I have been in Melbourne for less than half a year.\n5, I\u2019m familiar with the teaching way in unimelb.\n\n\nReally struggling these time, since I have to accept offer from ANU before October first.\nIf you have any recommendations, please let me know.\nAnd if you could give some more information about the program in ANU that will also be great.",

It will expose you to new lecturers who have different experience to those that trained you during your bachelor's degree.",

            "comment": "I'm incredibly biased since I'm an ANU alum so I have to say got with ANU. But if you're basing your choice off of internship or job prospects then either works in my opinion. There are very few actuarial internships in Melbourne from what I've heard and even less in canberra. Most of the jobs are in sydney, especially the insurance ones (I'd recommend EY, even though I hate the consulting lifestyle, I can't deny that you learn heaps from there). \n\nCanberra actuarial jobs are more focused around the government, especially the health system. I'm not sure what jobs are in Melbourne except for WorkCover and some big 4 consulting jobs (maybe finity or Taylor fry have some work down there). Quantium has a chunk of their people in melbourne but their insurance teams are in sydney. However the corporate insurer jobs are in sydney (iag, suncorp, allianz, qbe, tal, mlc and so on). Most of the people I meet during my years of work have been from Sydney unis, the next popular is probably ANU but there's quite a few unimelb alumni as well.\n\nIn terms of the coursework, I'm assuming you didn't do an actuarial undergrad degree. In that case, the majority of the ANU courses is just your normal statistics and finance courses aligned with the Part I program (I think they call it student program now?). There is one course called Actuarial Techniques where you do project work that's pretty interesting but that's about it.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about the social side of things. Just rock up to class or the student societies and you'll probs make a few mates. Undergrad and postgrad students go to the same classes for coursework so you can also meet a wide range of people (I had quite a few postgrad mates when I was studying as an undergrad). The community for actuarial is tiny, not just in uni but when you work as well.\n\nSource: if it isn't clear, I work in the actuarial field and studied at ANU several years ago\n\nFeel free to dm if you want to ask qs",

                    "comment": "So, actually I do had my bachelor degree majored in Actuarial studies in unimelb. That\u2019s why I may have a 1.5 year courses at ANU in two years, and almost got full part 1 exemptions. If you are working now, can I ask, in real working time, is there like bias between unimelb and ANU? Like which uni will be preferred in job finding perspective:-D. And the most important reason that I would like to go to ANU is because I think my oral English is pretty poor as well as my writing, so I would like to spend more time in school, (I should complete my master in 1.5 year in unimelb but 2 years in ANU). But I have thought about it last night, that would it be worth it to spend half a year in school just for practicing my English. And one of my friend has told me that to learn English it\u2019s not about time, but to push yourself using English in daily life.",

The actuarial job market is generally always looking for more suitable analysts and will consider almost anyone. The interviews are really where the difference is made. It just so happens that not a lot of students from unimelb apply for sydney jobs for whatever reason.\n\nI don't know what the best way to practise English for you is but I would expect that getting work experience or going to social events would help a lot. Every city has language exchange events as well from what I've been told. Using this as the sole reason for extending your time in uni is not productive.",

I would search for the language exchange events you\u2019ve mentioned. And try harder to practice my English. Again, thanks a lot for your time. Having someone giving some more information that I never thought before is really helping. Sometimes I struggle a lot to choose in between, always having thoughts that every choice have their own advantages, and forgot to think about what do I really want. So my next step would be finding a internship or part time job in my summer break~If possible can I ask questions about having an internship in insurance company?",

    "postText": "Hello everyone. I'm an international student who has received an offer to study bachelor of finance at ANU in feb 2022. (super super excited for it!) \n\nI'm on the verge of accepting my offer and had a few doubts related to accommodation. Since the borders will start to open up in Nov and most likely students will be allowed in the near future, are there any international students who've applied/received offers for accommodation on campus?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I'm looking at one of the catered/ Flexi catered colleges( bruce and wright being one of my top choices) How hard is it to get accepted at one of those and by when should I ideally apply?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks all :)",

I will be joining ANU winter session 2022 too as a postgraduate student in CASS school. \n\nAs far as I know ANU gives ACC priority for undergraduate students to live in on-campus acc but the offer might not correspond with your preference. \nHowever in order to get an offer you have to register first on ANU ACC website first where you can indicate your preferred dorm. \n\nSince you will commence on semester 1 2022 \nI think you should start applying now.",

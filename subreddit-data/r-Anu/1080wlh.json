    "postText": "Hey guys\n\nLooking at transferring to ANU for CSU Albury in Environment and Sustainability for semester 1 or maybe 2.\nWondering how Anu is socially and overall if it would be worth making the switch because it's pretty boring here and I want to get a bit more out of uni.\n\nCheers",

            "comment": "1. College life (like anywhere) is pretty good. However, everything else isn't. Canberra is often described as 'soulless' and 'quiet'. Almost everyone in college goes home to their parents during the break which means all the partying and social events happen when school is on. College is also particularly expensive so unless you find a way into a college circle, it's unlikely you'll find a parallel social life.\n\n2. If you went to Albury to study and grew up in the rural country, you'll find the kids here a shocker. The difference between country and city (Canberra is more a regional centre) culture will be pretty hard to adjust to. I also knew a few people from Albury and I think just about half of them transferred back.",

            "comment": "I disagree with the last guy, although im local born and bred. Canberra has a lot of stuff on offer, you have just got to know where to look. Our bars, for example, are so much better than our night clubs. Canberra is also a relatively young territory in medium age, so there are a lot of locals who are here year round. When uni is on, it's much more vibrant though.\n\nRegarding the country vs city divide, Canberra is, again, a hodge podge. We're a rich larger regional hub, however it's much less than most parts of Sydney and Melbourne in reality. If you're local, you'll always run into someone and everyone knows someone else sort of thing. Its quiet, and the Brindies are only 30 minutes away to go dirt bike riding, 4x4 offroading, shit like that. Rural NSW is only 30 minutes away from ANU campus for example.\n\nRegarding ANU exactly, the people are hit and miss. There's a lot of rich old money from Sydney Northshore that come here for the prestige but didn't make it into UniMelb or they want into the APS or the political scene. I find good people in that crowd hard to find. If you don't live on campus as well, the experience is dead. You basically go for classes and any clubs you're involved in, and that's it. Besides maybe studying at one of the four libraries or chilling with the friends you have made.",

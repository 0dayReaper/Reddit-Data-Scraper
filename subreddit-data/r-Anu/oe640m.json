If it\u2019s a mandatory course then you\u2019ll have to wait til the next time it is offered and complete it that way. In some instances this may put you back up to a year if it is only offered once per year.\n\nIf it is an elective, you may be able to find a suitable winter/summer course to take to make up the units.\n\nThe best thing you can do is book in to your college\u2019s student-help team and look at your study plan. Even if it\u2019s a mandatory course that\u2019s only offered one a year you may be able to finish your degree on time, depending on the units you have completed so far and the units you still need to complete.",

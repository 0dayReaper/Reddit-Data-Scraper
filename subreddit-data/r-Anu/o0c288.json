    "postText": "Hi, I'm starting my first year IT course from the next semester and wondering what I can prepare before I kick start the course. I'm slightly confused if I will be taking Semester 1 compulsory modules when I start in Semester 2 or Semester 2 compulsory modules with the other Year 1 students who started in February. Also I would very much appreciate it if any IT students on here can kindly enlighten me with useful study information to know. E.g. any good discrete maths workbooks available online and so on?... Cheers.",

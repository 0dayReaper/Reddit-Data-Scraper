    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI got an early offer to commence ANU in 2022 but I am a little stuck. A lot of factors are stopping me from going, but in the end it is my dream university within Australia and I am fleshing out my options. I was thinking of deferring my offer for a semester in order to work and make sure this is really what I want to do, if anyone has done this, it it worth it? I don't want to miss out on the activities in the beginning of the year when everyone gets to know each other, but it would be smarter to work and save up for that coming semester - right? \n\nUltimately I am considering other options for my family, who don't want me to move from Sydney. I will be going at some point, the question is when and if there are any other options available to me.\n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated, don't be afraid to be harsh.",

You\u2019ll find that every course you meet different people, so don\u2019t worry about everyone knowing each other or anything. Better to be prepared when you first come than run out of money or struggle through.",

Some of the compulsory courses only run in Semester 1, and you need to do those before doing the ones offered in Semester 2. But for commerce, it should be fine. Take your time, no need to rush if you don't feel ready for uni just yet.",

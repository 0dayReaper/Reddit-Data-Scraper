And if it is, will ANU let me switch/which college/lodge should I try to get into?",

Staying on campus has its own benefits. One is social life. If you are an extrovert and like hanging out with people I'd say staying on campus is worth it. Cos you can hangout in the libraries if you want some cool air and wifi \ud83d\ude09",

No air con but there is definitely wifi for mobile devices just some devices like IOT devices don't support the wifi security protocol that requires username and password (forget what it's called). \n\nIn terms of being in a 5 share, it really depends on who you get assigned with, can be great if you like the other people and they understand shared responsibilities. But it can also be absolute hell if you get bad people. Also unilodge is pretty terrible at administration and their management are pretty sexist.\n\nI'm not sure about your options in terms of switching before you arrive but I think you should send and email Anu accommodation and ask them. It's incredibly difficult to leave a contract once you're locked into one and if they do let you out, they'll try to get as much money out of you as possible through bogus fees (fairly sure lots of the stuff unilodge does is illegal)\n\nHopefully there's some useful information in that post lol",

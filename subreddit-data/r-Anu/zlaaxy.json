    "postText": "Hello Student ~~Borg~~ Hivemind!\n\nI'm starting second year of B.Sci (Psych) and I have quite a few electives up my sleeve. I'm doing this degree to get a better GPA to get into medicine, so the GPA rules for the med schools are generally that your final year is weighted most heavily, second last (this year for me) x2, and first year x1\n\nI do have a few interesting and very straightforward subjects to enrol in, but I also want to potentially save some of them for my final year.\n\nSo! Does anyone know of any very HD-doable subjects they'd like to share? Thanks so much :-D",

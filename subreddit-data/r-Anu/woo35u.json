In general most of the first two years is on the ANU Acton campus rather than in Canberra Hospital, so I'd suggest look into accommodation on campus (https://www.anu.edu.au/study/accommodation/compare-residences - good website to compare what you're looking for in terms of catering style etc) . In general Laurus Wing and Post-Graduate Burgmann Village are common for incoming Medical Students so it's a good chance to make friends with your cohort, you could also consider Packard Wing, UniLodge, Graduate House. Plus those colleges are a 10 minute walk to the lecture halls. Hope this helps!",

I can\u2019t seem to get a clear picture as to how big it really would be from the pics and 3d tours so I was wondering if you\u2019d know how laurus wing is in terms of space?",

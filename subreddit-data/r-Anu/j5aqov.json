From what I found online a lot of stuff is supposed to be focused around PBLs to sort of tie everything together for that week? At least in the first years, do you find that to be the case or is it more just traditional lectures which you'd review AND also PBLs? I'm also curious how many hours you guys spend in different settings each week, like how much time is spent in lectures, clinical, tutorial, etc. each week?",

Probably about 3 hours of lectures and 3 hours of skills but it varies a lot.\n\nThe other four days we typically have 2 hours of practical anatomy/pathology, about 4 hours of PBL spread over a few sessions and about 10-15 hours of lectures. There are even fewer lectures in second year because you also have every Monday off for research project work.\n\nI don\u2019t think quality would be an issue at any of the medical schools in the non-clinical years - simple because there is so much depth and complexity in medicine that you could, for example, likely spend a whole career studying a single transporter. The role of medical school in the early years is just to provide the key parts of each topic which is very hard to do poorly. A good rule of thumb is that the important parts to know are the overlap between lectures, textbooks and other online resources (basically the Venn diagram of what you should actually study). There are of course random terrible lectures by random clinicians or weird scheduling stuff ups where material is out of order but in general it is pretty good.",

Often medicine is conceptually simple and just high volume and you don\u2019t need to do much extra reading - just synthesise the information into something you can easily structure and recall. However, we just did haematology which has a few more complex areas and for that I found a textbook I liked and it was useful to read about some of the detail to really understand it.",

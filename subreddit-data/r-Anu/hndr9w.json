            "comment": "DEMO1001 is mostly conceptual and theory-based from what I understand. There will probably be some light data analysis, but I really doubt you\u2019ll need anything like stats or calculus. I took a very similar course last year (POLS1009) and we had a massive Excel database to use for various assignments. Lots of numbers, not a lot of math. I ended up learning more about Excel shortcuts than I did about essay writing, which is what the course is theoretically about. I didn\u2019t enjoy it, but that had a lot more to do with me than the course itself.\n\nEither way, a 1000-level course is designed to be an easy introduction. They\u2019re as much for finding out what you want to learn as they are for teaching you. If it\u2019s not your thing, just drop before the census date and it won\u2019t even show up on your transcript. I\u2019d also suggest looking at SELT surveys to get a feel for the course content, and searching ANU Confessions (no @anu.edu.au  address required) to see what other people have said about it.",

There are tonnes of good learning materials available for free nowadays. The point is you will need to use it eventually. It's better to start early. Talking from experience. I'm a PhD student btw.",

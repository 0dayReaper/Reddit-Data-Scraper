    "postText": "What are the chances of obtaining a scholarship at Anu? (for undergrad!! i\u2019m currently in year 12 planning to apply for early access). \nI am not applicable for any of the adjustment factors (financial hardship, etc.) \nI am located in Sydney (near the city),though I don\u2019t think the scholarship take into account the fact that I have to move interstate. \nAlso, for courses like Mathematical Science that offer 10 scholarships and have a low number of people applying, would that increase my chances? \nAlso, to be applicable for scholarships such as that mentioned above, do I need to include the course in my 5 chosen courses? (like for the math science scholarship, theyd only consider me if i put it in my 5 preferences right?) Does it have to be the number 1 preference? \n\nLastly, anyone who\u2019s received a scholarship and is in a similar (even if only slightly) position to me, pls message me so I can ask more questions! Thanks for your all your help guys! :(",

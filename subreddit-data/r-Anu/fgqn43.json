    "postText": "I\u2019m looking at doing post grad at ANU and have a few questions:\n\n1. What are people\u2019s experiences with IR and strategic studies? Is one more interesting/varied/practical/employable than the other? I\u2019ve heard mixed reviews so far.\n\n2. I know there aren\u2019t prerequisite undergrad degrees for these programs, but is it unrealistic for someone with a different degree background (journalism) to apply? Is there too much assumed knowledge? Is there any reading I could do to make up for this?",

            "comment": "If you're wondering what's more employable, IR definitely is. Strategic Studies is very practical and case study based, which IR has as well but there is a emphasis on theory as well in IR. IR is a more universal degree, and could have you put honestly in any field. Strategic Studies locks you into government or security. Rest assured, ANU is the best place to study either in Australia and arguably one of the top places in the Pacific, so you'd be good whichever you picked. There are heaps of opportunities to meet influential people; I've met the former American DNI and 2 PM's, amongst others.\n\nThere is a lot of assumed knowledge, but nothing that couldn't be learned yourself. A lot of IR and strategic studies revolves around 3 theories in particular. A grasp of those, along with a basic overview of the global system and common sense regarding how countries behave is all you really need. I don't have any books off the top of my head that would be best, but i think the work of John Mearsheimer and Samuel Huntington is the best place to start. They have some pretty famous articles and books that are well written and don't assume a huge amount. I know a few different people whose degrees weren't in the field who ended up studying it as a masters, including one's with a bachelor of journalism.",

Realism and Liberalism are the main focus of any sort of study in the field, constructivism is a relatively new theoretical approach that's taught quite heavily at ANU. It is less actively applied, but is becoming more popular.  It's less rules based than the other two, and focuses more on how culture and norms shape how countries behave.",

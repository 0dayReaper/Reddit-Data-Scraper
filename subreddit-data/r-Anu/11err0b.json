    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nJust wondering if anybody lived at Yukeembruk? It seems very new and so there is not a lot of information out about it but it certainly looks peaceful and modern. \n\nWhat is it like? How are the studio rooms? Are the kitchens good? How competitive is the application?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Many had doubts before moving in as many were just dumped there after everywhere else was full. I voluntarily wanted to go and it now seems to have been the best decision as it is a very fun place to live on campus. \n\nThe main detractors are the price and location but most of my friends I gave tours to after moving in want to transfer here next sem. \n\nGiven how close a lot of us are here and like to get involved in the inter hall arts / sports / hobbies, I imagine after first sem, the reputation it will have across campus will be greatly preferred to other residences.\n\nStandard Rooms are a little smaller than I expected with not much storage space compared to lodge, but I am here for one year until I graduate and am very happy I got selected to be here",

            "comment": "Just and fyi, i don\u2019t live there, but i have many friends who live there so went for a tour/visit quite often.\nIf you can afford it (and if there\u2019s a spot left), pay some extra and get the bigger sized room. I personally feel like the standard rooms are too small, especially compared to other residents like the lodges, Fenner, etc. \nKitchen itself is nice but again, storage space is small. Especially fridge/freezer space is insanely small. I\u2019ve heard that they are bringing in more fridges but not too sure how it went eventually.\nOther than that, it\u2019s modern, brand new, has lots of common spaces (music rooms, art room, lounge, cafe/bar etc) and has a good community spirit as they are a new hall so the SRs and the execs are trying to make it as lively and engaging as possible.",

The community here is so inclusive and welcoming- we have our own cafe space/village hall and it is honestly such a lovely place to hang out and chat with friends. I also love our huge study room. \n\nThe only downside is probably how far you have to walk to get to the middle of campus, but honestly, it is probably good exercise and it's a beautiful walk anyway! \n\nHappy to answer any other questions you have!",

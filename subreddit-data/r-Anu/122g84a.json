The kitchen is one gigantic room, so keep in mind that you'll need to cook with/in front of quite a few people at meal time, that was the only issue I had living there.",

            "comment": "Burton and Garren hall would be just as nice as any of the others on the list, only difference is that it is older so appliances and stuff is older I believe. I would probably say it would have the best culture out of all of them because of its age. At the end of the day, what will matter more than which hall you pick will be how much effort you put in to meeting people and becoming friends, you will have a bad time if you aren\u2019t open to meeting new people and don\u2019t force yourself to meet new people in uncomfortable positions, everyone is in the same position and you only get out of the college experience what you take out",

            "comment": "I'm a first year student from QLD and I am at Wamburun Hall and I am loving it. Everyone is really nice and there is a good community if thats what you're into. The facilities are good and the whole place still feels very new (built 2019). The kitchen is great and unless it's peak time you can find a spot to cook and even if it is peak hour you should only have to wait 15 minutes before a space opens up. The toilets and showers are good but some floors are better than others, I haven't had any problems yet but apparently some floors are better at clogging toilets than others haha. \n\nIt's also one of the cheaper residences which is great because it doesn't feel cheap at all. The location is good but it is a bit of a walk to kambri but honestly I like it because I get good exercise every day I've got classes because of it. There's music rooms, a theatre, two pool tables, a ping pong table, an arts and crafts room and a computer room which are all pretty good. There's also study rooms and common rooms on every floor but honestly the study rooms are mostly used as a second fridge for when the mini fridge in your room breaks down and for the microwave and very few people actually study in them. The fifth floor is half rooms and half a sort of common area with a balcony, Cafe and nice places to study but I actually haven't been up there yet although I've heard it's really nice.",

From the people I know, wamburun seems good for party people and seems to have more people that are responsible for their own finances. Fenner is very central. Odds are, wherever you go, you\u2019ll be able to make friends, just take a good look at the location and facilities to find what is best for you.",

            "comment": "If you are looking for hall I would suggest Fenner. It is at a really great space close to city and other places as well. Great culture, polite people and clean facilities, some of my friends live there and I often visit it. It is the same as wamburun hall except you have to pay for laundry at wamburun but at fenner it\u2019s free. Also, one of the biggest drawback I would say of wamburun is that it\u2019s too far even if you like walking it gets really dark around there and if you are out late it\u2019s pretty scary tbh (I am saying from my personal experience) some people don\u2019t mind it though. \nI myself live at Unilodge (KL) and since I like my own space it is really nice for me and I have made quite great friends here since every floor has its meeting, cookups and if you go to common room you can talk to people there(you will always find people there to make friends).\nAs for friends , everywhere it\u2019s the same you have to meet people and talk to them. It really depends that if you don\u2019t mind sharing with the facilities with other people you can go for halls.",

    "postText": "Hi I'm a 23m and was looking to study at ANU for a Bachelor of International Security Studies, however on the 25th of I received at email saying my application had \"been considered and has not been successful in this offer round\". I was wondering fi there would still be a chance to be accepted at a later offer round or if not, any advice you guys had, If I had my heart set on this course, about alternative pathways or suggestions.",

            "comment": "I don't know about the application process but consider this pathway. Apply and accept an offer for a Bach Arts degree. Pick the Global Security or Asia-Pacific Security major. Most (not all) courses you can do in those two majors are directly creditable to BINSS. After two semesters (48 units) worth of study your ANU GPA would be considered instead of your ATAR (or equivalent) for a degree transfer into BINSS. BINSS is just a name degree; all the courses in it can be done under BA (somehow).",

            "comment": "I believe there are only two more offer rounds (Feb Round 1 &amp; 2). There is a chance that your application could be re-considered in those rounds if ANU is participating. However, according to UAC, anything after the Jan round is just purely for filling vacancies. So if you were unsuccessful in Jan with your ISS degree, you are likely to still be unsuccessful in Feb. So if I were you, I'd put your Bachelor of ISS first in the UAC preferences, and then put a Bachelor of Arts second. If you are not eligible for ISS, you may be eligible for the Arts degree and that way, even if you miss out on ISS, you can transfer into it (per other comment on this thread). Hope this helps!",

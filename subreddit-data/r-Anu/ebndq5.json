    "postText": "I am a Victorian year 12 student planning to study a double degree of commerce and PPE next year. I like the idea of working in government and I figured that studying in Canberra would make it easier for me to do so. I was just wondering if internships in government were common among ANU students? Also, if there is anyone who has undertaken one of these internships, are you given particularly interesting or enriching work? (I would most like to work around economics and management)",

            "comment": "There is an internship program run by the College of Business and Economics (where your commerce degree is located).  Full details are at: https://www.cbe.anu.edu.au/study/internship/\n\nIt's a fairly competitive entry process, so the program is done by a relatively small number of students each year.  I was the academic supervisor for a student this year (you have an academic supervisor from the uni, and a supervisor at your workplace).  My student seemed to enjoy the experience, and my understanding is that in most cases students enjoy the program.",

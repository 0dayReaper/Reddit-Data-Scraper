    "postText": "I am keen in learning Bachelor of Science, computer science major in 2023 in ANU. I am slightly confused about the university's language pre-requisite. As I am not sure if i will be getting a scaled 30+ in EAL, does ANU require me to get a scaled 30+ in EAL study score (EAL scales down by like 1 or 2) or I only have to get an \"unscaled\" raw 30, which scales down to 28-29 to get into the university? Assuming I get 80+ ATAR.",

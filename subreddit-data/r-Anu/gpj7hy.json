    "postText": "Hey guys, \n\nSo basically next year starting semester two, I\u2019ll begin studying the bachelor of criminology. However I have a few questions;\n\nFirstly, I\u2019ll be living on campus in a one bedroom/studio (would prefer privacy over living with randoms). Is there any particular lodge/hall/college you\u2019d recommend for someone who wants to socialise? How would I even go about making friends if I don\u2019t know anyone in ANU to begin with? I\u2019m 19 &amp; aussie if that helps. \n\nSecondly, I heard ANU is a relatively large university. Does anyone know which accomodation on campus is closest to where I\u2019d be studying criminology or are they all similar in distance? \n\nI guess what I\u2019m asking is, considering I\u2019m someone moving on their own with no family or connections in Canberra, what accom would be my best bet for study convenience &amp; making friends? \n\nThanks,\nJaizaya.",

I've written many times before that i believe i think the colleges with communal dining are much easier (formaking friends), as you're all sitting together at the same time. Just dont have dietary requirements.\n\n\nAnything on campus will be fine. All undergrad is in the same area anyway",

            "comment": "Hey Jaizaya!\n\nFirst of all, good degree choice, I myself am studying a double in International Security and Criminology so I'm sure you'll have a blast. In regards to you living on campus, every college on campus (except for Uniloge accommodation like LK) has your own individual room, bed, table etc. The only main difference is whether or not you want to attend a catered or non-catered college (the difference is around $200 per week). Don't worry about the fact that you won't know anyone, that's honestly like 90% of the people that join anyways. Hopefully, this COVID mess goes away by next year because right now everything is on lockdown. \n\nAnd yes, ANU is a large university (coming from what I thought was a relatively large high school in Sydney). Any on-campus accommodation will be close to your classes (Criminology classes are spread out because in the first two years you'd be studying subjects from psychology to sociology), so there's really no need to stress over that. \n\nFor the social part, honestly, every college has its own unique traits. Really depends on your personality and how much of an introvert/extrovert you are.",

            "comment": "Hey Jaizaya, The question is do you want to cook for yourself? ANU is pretty big but I ride from end to end essentially to get to class and it takes less than 10 min. If you don't want to cook Burg is really great for socialising and a great social culture (may have a slight bias) but my mates at Bruce say it's OK as well (In both of these colleges you will have your own small room but not a private social area). If not Wright or Fenner I've heard are pretty good. (Same sort of setup but have a communal kitchen)",

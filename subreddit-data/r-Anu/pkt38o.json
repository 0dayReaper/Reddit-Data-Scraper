    "postText": "Hi guys I\u2019ve been accepted into a master degree of Digital humanities and Public culture at ANU. Planning to start my study next year in July. (25 July 2022) Winter session I guess.\n\nLately, I\u2019ve been researching about compulsory courses for my first enrollment. I came across a bit of unpleasant experience while doing my academic preparation. Why (the hell) most of the interesting courses units are available only in Semester 1.\n\nIt\u2019s required for me to do 4 introductory courses out of 10 following choices. However when it comes to program start date that is compatible to mine, there are only 2 I can enroll. \n\nSo It becomes doubtful even more what\u2019s the difference between those two intakes.\n\n\nThanksss",

It is going to be a colossal waste of time.",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI'm a postgraduate transferring to ANU in Semester 2 :)\n\nI'm looking for accommodation in either the halls or unilodges. \n\nWould appreciate any suggestions/advice for accommodation recommendations for a postgrad! Would be ideal to be in a social environment as I'm also new to the city and would love to make new friends !\n\nOn another note, would it be trickier for me to get uni accom as I'm starting mid-year?\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

Unilodges are great if you like having your own personal space but not really a great place to make friends(they do host events and nights where you can talk to other people but it\u2019s not that effective).",

Dimensions of room in all dimensions, location of sink if there is one, location and shape of built in storage space and lastly especially window size shape and location in room, and, can the bed be moved around are all important variables.\n\nThank you for the insight ! I think I will definatley go for a hall :)",

From what I saw in wamba, one of my friend had bigger room and bed and another one has a really small bed and room. \nIf you are looking someplace near to the city you can choose fenner(a lot of drunk students goes from there and you will be disturbed if there\u2019s an event happening in uni ave) or toad (though it has less facilities) both these are closer to city and uni but other ones aren\u2019t.",

But I think it has self contained kitchen and bathroom which might not really a great place to meet new friends if that\u2019s what are looking for. Most of my friends where they have to share a kitchen with the hall which tbh sometimes can be not great(some people don\u2019t clean up after themselves and if you hungry midnight you\u2019ll have to go downstairs to make food).",

If you look back through the last few months you will find a lot of ideas.\n\nMy two cents- the room shape, window arrangement and set up in each residence/hall are quite different, and there is often wide variations between parts of the same residence/hall. This is due to different architectural ideas and times of build. If possible make them tell you about this. Dimensions of room in all dimensions, location of sink if there is one, location and shape of built in storage space and lastly especially window size shape and location in room, and, can the bed be moved around are all important variables.\n\nSecond 2c is arrangement of groups of rooms can make a big difference, example having a group of rooms with a shared kitchen and dining attached locally that they only use will make a strong social unit, a group of rooms with no attached kitchen not so much.",

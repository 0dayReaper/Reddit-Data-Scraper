    "postText": "Since we can choose to take a CRS grade (due to covid and only for this semester as it stands), which doesn\u2019t affect our GPA, and let\u2019s say it\u2019s available for both semesters. If I were to only opt in classes where I didn\u2019t get HDs, does that mean my GPA for that year would be 7?\n\nI must be missing something because I could just pass all my classes (and opt in) but HD in one and I\u2019ve positively skewed my GPA.",

You might be able to protect your GPA by doing that, but your score will still be there.",

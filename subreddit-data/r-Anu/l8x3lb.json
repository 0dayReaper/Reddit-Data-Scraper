    "postText": "Hi all, my situation is that I began my first year undergrad at anu last year and deferred before the census date to sem 2 where I undertook study at part time. I\u2019m going back to full time this year but will obviously be behind the usual units completed. I have asked my college if I am able to undertake autumn or winter sessions to make up for my missed units, they say yes but I am then unable to find them via the programs and courses website.\n\nHas anyone been in this situation or have any advice? \nAnything would be much appreciated!!",

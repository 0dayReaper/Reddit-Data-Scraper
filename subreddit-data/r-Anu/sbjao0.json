I have a psychology sciences degree from UQ and the difference was that those just completing a science degree majoring in psychology only had to complete a certain amount of credits in psychology, while those who were enrolled in the psychology sciences degree had a list of elective and compulsory subjects. By completing these subject you ensured that your degree would be APS (Australian psychology society) accredited. Finally it made the pathway to psychology honours easier (lower GPA  / no GPA requirements). May also help with enrollments in subjects.\n\nPlease just call the psychology school at anu, they will give you the best answer. Congratulations remember to have fun and study hard.",

            "comment": "Sorry for late response. \n\nThe bachelor of science (psych) is basically a science degree majoring in psychology. It's pretty much just a psychology degree. You have some electives which have to be science electives, so you do end up doing 2-4 subjects of non psychological subjects. Everything else is psychology. First year, you do your introductory psychology courses and some science electives. Then in your second and third year you do more in depth psychology subjects like cognitive psychology, social psychology, psych stats, etc. You also get some psychology electives to choose from in your second and third year. \n\nSo where the b of science (psych) majors in psychology, the bachelor of science allows for majoring in lots of things. You get a major and a minor and can pick to major in about 25 different options. You could major in chemistry or agriculture or computer science or biology, you get the idea. For a list of majors for b of science use this [Link](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/bsc). Make sure you click on the study tab and scroll down to view your choices of majors and minors.",

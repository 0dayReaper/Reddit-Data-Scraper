    "postText": "i\u2019m a first year bachelor of arts student (history &amp; archaeology) and have a number of disabilities, both physical and cognitive, &amp; mental illnesses. this semester i\u2019ve done 3 courses, which has been easier than 4 (which i started with), especially with an EAP. however i\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s sustainable especially as i have things other than uni that i want to do which i haven\u2019t been able to engage in as much as i\u2019d like so far. so i\u2019m considering only doing 2 courses next semester. are there any downsides to this (other than obviously graduating later, which is something I\u2019m considering a significant con as i\u2019d like to do postgrad soonish)? and possibly more importantly have any of you (esp if you\u2019re disabled too) done part time and benefitted from it?",

I don't see either of these as major negatives. \n\nYou won't be eligible for Austudy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiven that you want to do other things, and your medical conditions, I don't see any reason why you wouldn't drop back to part time. Don't forget that you can always change back to full time any time you want.",

If you can, 3 is a great balance between having time to live and finishing your degree almost as soon. Intensives are also good if they\u2019re on offer and manageable with your disabilities, especially if you\u2019re switching to 2 courses during the semester. \n\nI was handicapped for most of last semester and took 2 courses and found it great. \n\nAlso - you have your whole life to do postgrad. Take at least 4 years to get this degree, if not longer. It\u2019s better to take 2 courses at a time than to take 3 courses, burn out, and have to take the next sem off.",

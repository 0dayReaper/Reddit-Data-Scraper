    "postText": "I am transferring to Emory as a junior, planning to major in Psych while on the pre-med track. However, I had just noticed Emory has a much different Chemistry curriculum than most schools. While I took Gen Chem 1+2 and Orgo 1, I only received credit for CHM 150. That said, since I took Orgo-1 most recently, credit has yet to be evaluated for that class. That would mean I need to take CHM 202, 203, and 204 which is annoying since I already took 3 of the 4 required Chem classes at my CC. I have a few questions regarding my sticky situation I hope to receive some insight on. \n\n1. Can I appeal and try to get credit for CHM 202 since I already took Orgo-1? \n2. If I am unsuccessful in my attempt to receive credit for CHM 202, would I be able to take it in my first semester there, even though it is reserved for AP/IB freshmen? \n3. How much of a red flag will it be for me to finish UG in 5 years to Med School AdCom Officers? I did my first 2 at CC and realized many of my credits transferred to electives I don't need and am doubtful I can finish in 4 years flat, especially since I wish to major in a social science and take the Pre-Med Reqs on the side. \n\nThanks a lot. I would appreciate any insight on how to navigate my sticky situation.",

            "comment": "I don't think adcoms care when you finish (as long as it is reasonable-I mean so many people take gap years and have all types of pathways/journeys to med. school) so long as you finish with a strong GPA wise and get a strong MCAT indicating that Emory's curriculum and your preparation probably helped.  Talk to PHA or someone else about that to make sure though.\n\nWhat I will say is that exceptions are made where transfers ARE allowed to take chem 202-Z.  You should probably contact Dr. Kindt and Dr. Soria to express interest in this option and note that 202-Z will be quite challenging, HOWEVER, if you sit out and take standard 202 then you would merely be delaying the intensity to 203 where almost (or every if the lineup ends up identical to or similiar to fall 2023) every instructor will most likely be significantly more rigorous than your CC (unless you had an unusually rigorous instructor there) as it is even more complex than ochem 1/2 analogs at most similiar tier privates and publics.  If you take 202-Z, you'll be challenged, but you'll also be somewhat advantaged because you will have \"some\" content familiarity from the ochem 1 course you took.  The only difference may be: A) If your CC course was like most ochem 1 courses elsewhere, it was probably focused more on nomenclature, basic stereochemistry, and some reactivity, somewhat simple reaction mechanisms associated with those.  Soria will push you to do much higher level applications and mechanism style problems.  This will be great for MCAT prep and whatnot, but you should prepare for that if it wasn't how your CC  class was run (unlike most, I do not stereotype all CCs as \"easy\".  Some instructors may be, but often courses are much smaller so you may actually end up taking an \"abberation\" that intentionally challenges students in the way I describe Dr. Soria as doing, even if not quite as intensely, you at least know how to problem solve at a decent level if exposed to anything similiar.  Often it is actually research universities that default to memorization oriented ochem courses because with large class sizes, tests and problems that mainly require drill and memory are easier to grade).\n\nThe upside to this is that you will kind of stay on \"track\" with chemistry (you can actually take something like biochem in the biol dept WITH chem 203-Z) and taking Soria will make Liotta's (or whoever's) 203-Z  much easier (Liotta has some problem solving style emphasis, but it is significantly less intensive than Soria) and then you can take a fall version of chem 204 which in the hands of Lynn is more like a problem/project based course than a test based course.  Apparently the relatively loose structure of his 204 frustrates some, but I think it is ultimately a better way to learn 204 material in legit contexts that mirror how that sort of material may be tested on the MCAT.  In addition, the smaller fall 204-L is probably still not great but is much better than the large enrollment spring 204-L.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother option that I do NOT recommend is that you can complete ochem 2 somewhere else and probably dodge Emory's chem curriculum altogether, but this could cause some problems with biochem (but they may allow it understanding you are a transfer and ochem 1/2 is more than enough for biol 301) and it'll count for med. school.  I do have this feeling that they'd want to see some solid performances in Emory (4 year university) chemistry/STEM courses and honestly a lot of Emory's are taught quite well(again, to have added value even if it does delay or off-set your MCAT a little) and have a lot of support even when they are very \"pushy\" in terms of workload or intellectual complexity.  They have a lot of added value.\n\n\\*Also, hopefully your CC credits get around Emory's weird psyche curric. where the intro is a 2 semester sequence where whatever intro course you bring in is most likely to fullfill 111 and not 110 and some electives and depth courses may require 110 and not just 111.  Emory actually has oddities in a lot of unexpected places and that is what makes some departments great in terms of added value but not that friendly to transfers unfortunately.  You may want to try to say your ochem 1 gives you enough to handle standard 203, but the issue is that recent 202 students may still be advantaged versus you because 202 covers some reactions (in conceptual depth) typically covered in ochem 2 courses at most schools and they will very quickly refresh that in 203 so the first exam ends up like an application level assessment of a mixture of typical ochem 2 and ochem 1 topics (with the ochem 1 topics being stuff typically covered maybe like in the middle of a standard ochem 1 course) coupled with a serious emphasis on MO theory.  Much like 202-Z with Soria, you need to be ready for that reality if you somehow get placed into 203 with any instructor (I get this feeling all 3 instructors will have a similiar style and level of challenge which means they will require a lot of thought and effort).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:  I found this:[http://chemistry.emory.edu/home/documents/undergraduate/transfer\\_guide\\_sp22.pdf](http://chemistry.emory.edu/home/documents/undergraduate/transfer_guide_sp22.pdf)\n\nI would try to place into 203(tell the appropriate office about your ochem 1 credit when complete) and beg for Weinschenk's section(maybe they'll make an exception because as a transfer you were not allowed to compete in initial rounds of enrollment so they may overload you or something) or go to McDonald.  I know for sure that either will be at a good level and will teach the content well.  McGill is known as a great instructor for 150 and 202 but has not taught 203 (or really any ochem with a serious MO emphasis) before, so that can end up like a wildcard which given the intentional rigor of 203 in the hands of any fulltime faculty member could be risky.  Note that guide also confirms that Z is on the table (and I know Soria has taken transfers and even Oxford continuees before).",

A 5 or 4.5 year timeline is common, especially for transfers at Emory who are pre-med, and even more so for those who are NBB majors where lack of 202 credit may bar access to NBB 301.  I've seen your situation before and you'll be fine.  Also remember that med. schools take some folks from big engineering schools like Georgia Tech where a 4.5-5 year timeline for a BME major or something is quite common especially if they do the recommended co-op experience. If you can't place into 203, then express interest in Soria's class and he and Kindt will likely hook you up.",

            "comment": "The other comment here already gives a really comprehensive description of your different chem options, so I don't have much to add beyond a little more insight into z-track chem courses (202z/203z). For reference, I am pre-med, and took z-track orgo + Lynn's funky 204. However, I am also very familiar with regular 202/203/204 course content and how it differs from the z-track, which is why I want to get my two cents in. \n\n* I think content wise, z-track courses will be better suited to someone in your position that did not take CHEM 150 at Emory, since the regular 202/203/204 track really builds off of content that was theoretically learned in previous semesters (not many folks at Emory veer off the traditional pathway unless they have 150 credit and opt for z-track their freshman year). In 202z, Soria starts with the very, very basic stuff to make sure that everyone is on an even playing field, and that content builds on itself and is very connected to the material that is covered in 203z (Soria has a very heavy hand in z-track's course design). 202z is probably the best course to start with when comparing it to regular 202.\n* In general, 202 and 203 are really difficult courses, even for the students who manage to take them with the best professors. Orgo is probably going to be hard anywhere, but in MY opinion, 202z is probably made easier than 202 by the fact that Soria is able to control what goes onto exams based on what's specifically covered in class, due to the small class size. The small class size also just helps a lot with building a community where you can help each other, and he offers ample (and i mean AMPLE) bonus points. Orgo experience depends a lot on the professor, and Soria is a tough, but good one. \n* Do you have lab credit? 202L and 203L are a LOT more work (especially 203L with Mulford- that final exam is killer) than the z-track equivalents. Seriously. I had almost no outside work (lab reports, etc) for 202zL and 203zL, but a lot 203L students in particular have complained that had did more work for the 2-credit lab than 4-credit lecture courses.\n* In the event that you do end up getting 202 credit, I would consider carefully whether or not you want to jump straight into 203 in the fall. I can't at all speak to your chemistry background, so maybe the courses you have taken gave you all of the information you need to know. However, through TAing and tutoring and whatnot, I've become pretty familiar with 203 curriculum (particularly Weinschenk's version - I wanna say he's universally considered the best orgo prof), and it's tough. Even for kids that thought 202 was a breeze. MO stuff is trickier than people expect it to be, especially if it wasn't taught in depth by previous professors, and the problems posed on exams demand that you have a solid understanding of how and why everything works (\"why would this mechanism occur this way and not that way\" or \"where would the site of attack be and why\" -- this is where a lot of people would get tripped up). I don't recommend jumping straight into 203 unless you're really confident about your background, since it will likely be difficult even if your background is strong? Not to mention 203L being a nuisance in its own right. \n\nI guess I had a lot more to say than I thought I did, oops. Sorry this was so unnecessarily long. Bottom line, I think z-track is a great option, though you'd also probably come out alright if you took regular 202 in the spring. Since you- understandably- want to start chem in the fall though, 202z would be the much easier option compared to regular 203. If you do go for 202z, you might have to push Soria a little (he can be. Stubborn sometimes), but if you explain the extenuating circumstances of you being a transfer with 150 credit, he'd get it. All that being said, the chem department at Emory is pretty awesome, and regardless of how you choose to do things, you'll be well prepared for MCAT / med school stuff. Best of luck, and feel free to pm if you want elaboration about anything i said:)",

Interesting to say the least. i personally hated it. it was project based, so yay no exams, but i honestly would have taken the normal exam-based class instead of it. i genuinely feel like i learned nothing, and it was also 1) crazy disorganized 2) unclear grading scheme 3) all graded assignments were big, GROUP-BASED projects (i had the worst possible group, so that didn't help). meanwhile at least normal 204  emphasizes biochem stuff that shows up on the mcat. just mentioning it because it may help with planning down the line",

That's honestly the part that I think is very useful if you can motivate yourself(I think Lynn's curriculum is what 204 is SUPPOSED to be but the spring versions pivot to more biochem and raw bio-organic vs. Material sciences/assembly stuff because that is closer to their training).  The \"biochem\" stuff/can can be made up with 340 which I hear is taught very well (content and context emphasized) by both Salaita and Raj.  If he doesn't have that anymore and just throws projects at folks, then maybe the standard version of 204 (especially Weinschenk) is much better.  I dunno, 204 seems tricky.  It's either Lynn's disorganization/scattered brainedness (he tries to mimick Eisen it seems but Eisen is way more organized and has way more resources to maintain the flow of his course, grade/give feedback in a way that makes sense, etc)and a smaller lab(so less chaotic when stuff fails) and maybe more interesting content in lecture if you can focus enough to teach yourself or it's Spring 204 lecture's hyper organization test based environment (and I think W is the only one that assesses 204 worth a damn in a way that promotes retention and deeper understanding even if it is dialed back vs his 203) and the large labs which can apparently be terrible depending on who is teaching",

And y'all goin' a little ham over this \"she should be fired and the administration should get involved\". Just drips entitlement.  As awful as she was from what I heard, that lady ain't been there for that long (and has maybe run this lab for 1.5 semesters in a dept not well equipped to run that type of lab without collaboration from another dept like bio.  She was also apparently decent for lecture). \n\n There was also some weird stuff about her \"designing\" the lab which is not true.  Lynn and Heemstra (Jen) did and then left folks like Soria, McKnelly, and McCormick(McCormick got lucky and dodged the bio experiments because COVID hit the semester he tried.  Soria had like 20+ years experience and runs his own teaching lab like every semester) with the bag of dealing with that crazy lab.  To me it looks like she has something goin' on and needs intervention going forward and that'll be for the chemistry department to figure out (the \"university\" or \"administration\" ain't gettin' involved in nothing and a bunch of seasoned sophomores and upper classmen should know it).  There were also comments about her PhD. Let me assure you that most STEM PhD programs do NOT focus on teaching whatsoever and she is fresh out of grad. School.\n\nI get folks being super upset but damn some problematic traits of people are being unmasked in some of those comments!  I don't know about 50 being taken down/flag but I saw like 10 that were a little off the wall.  Like go back and try to trash her in a way that doesn't involve sexist stuff.  There is apparently plenty to legit complain about without needing to do that",

I had every single one of my labs fail because of the disorganization on the part of the people in charge. We had every lab be a fighting ground for the equipment needed, so people who got it first finished up to 2 hours before other groups. Experiments were changed the morning of certain labs without the the students knowing, so people who followed their lab procedure they made earlier in the week were set up for failure. She never walked into the lecture hall or the lab the entire semester. I didn\u2019t even know what she looked like till I saw a picture of her in the chem 204 GroupMe about the award ceremony like week. She promised to give us material to study for our exam but she ghosted us. People signed up for office hours and 1 on 1 meetings and she did not show up. Yeah the sexist and weird comments were out of hand, but no one is gonna listen to students and she will continue to teach the same way she did during both the spring and fall semesters. There was material on the exam that was so completely simple that it took 5 minutes to google and be able to answer the exact same question on a different test, but everyone is doing awful on them, which I heard from TAs going over the exams. A paper should not be able to drop your grade to a C if you don\u2019t get about an 85%. An exam should not drop you to a B if you get below a high 80. That grading scale is not balanced. Students are not the only ones reporting her to the chemistry department, TAs and GSIs are doing the same thing. Why is she teaching a lot where she is allergic to the chemical we use, which was also heard directly from a TA.",

A faculty member told me it was like that last semester so I predicted the large enrollment labs to be a disaster.  But I personally just think the lab ain't right (concept is neat but can chem execute now? NO! IMO) Add that to something clearly being off with her and this lab this year and you get this semester.  I just don't know if a replacement could succeed in the spring. McCormick has never done the whole thing and Soria has successfully done the smaller fall lab and he said things failed there but he could convince and work in extra time for students to repeat(he had the frosh ochem kids who were a little more motivated or aquainted with him so he could negotiate stuff like that with them) experiments.  Either way I don't know what should happen to McKnelly or that lab but she isn't the only problem and she also doesn't warrant any sexist comments or stuff asking how she got a PhD because it didn't involved running a lab destined to fail.  I know all of what you said is true but people should just say that in the comments instead of going buckwild with some strange sexism and other stuff.\n\n*On the old credit system I think basically all 2 hour labs met twice a week.  That is the only way a lab that involves cloning and stuff in the chem department can succeed with anyone really.  Without that they need to replace her (or get her whatever help she needs to get the thing to make sense or whatever is necessary to make her show up) and give her something else to do (maybe lecture or an upper division lab would make sense.  I mean Emory chem is still having to bring in people like Gabriel from outside of Emory because of staffing shortages.  They are also using tenured inorganic and physical chemists to teach things like 150 and 202 including people like Hill who are generally known to be terrible at teaching their own upper division course. What a mess?!). A lot of things don't add up but once it gets as bad as this McKnelly thing, people notice that and only use their energy on it (makes sense because it is currently affecting them) but there should be other bigger picture questions to ask like why Kindt, Hill, and Heaven are teaching gen. Chem? And why is Gabriel there?",

What I am trying to figure out is this Weinschenk thing.  Did he go to 202 to escape 204 which is a weird class (but I'm sure Weinschenk.would.just tailor it to the bio content) or is he up to something.  Or worse, is the chem dept that stretched? I kind of felt that maybe they could relieve enrollment pressures by finding a way of at least offering standard 202(AP credit folks could do that or go z-track vs.  Choosing between z-track, 150, and getting rusty sitting out chem for 1 semester before taking 202) and 203 every semester.",

My problem is that I think 204/204L have the potential to be the most useful classes within the chemistry curriculum in terms of high yield content and exposing folks to the types of issued they encounter in experimentally focused passages.  It's one thing for less useful classes to be easy and poorly run but when it could be useful to pre-meds and pre-grads considering chemical biology and the life sciences, then it probably needs to be at least decently run.\n\n\nNote that I think 202 (and maybe even 203) can be high potential as well but it seems like students can only(sometimes barely) tolerate learning and being tested on the simplest case studies (I heard they changed the lab so I don't know how 202 lab is).  Seems+ like the least important course, 203  is still the most well run (even if Mulford is a bit too intense for people's tastes).",

Also, I think the quality may have been lower than you thought to begin with except for 203 which is apparently decently run no matter who you take (I hear folks complain about Mulford's lab killing their time and being way too intense but apparently it makes sense for the most part).  And I think the quality of certain other STEM courses inside and outside of chem should be questioned but probably don't because most first years(which is what many/most were when taking gen. Bio and gen. Chem, and then recent cohorts before 2025 took COVID versions which were more \"happy go lucky\" due to deweighted things like exams were despite exams being easier) don't have a legit benchmark to compare against.\n\n So if the instructor sounds good/enthusiastic, can answer questions, and gives ultra predictable exams/assessments that is the benchmark for high quality. People like Weinschenk are admittedly exceptional talents because they can challenge students in different, less predictable ways and still get mostly high praise.  \n\nAnd the whole chem dept needs to figure out 204L because I heard there was one lab this semester where none of the needed equipment was working.  McKnelly needed to be there when that happened but what could she do other than calm folks down?  Bio is much better equipped to handle these scenarios (probably wouldn't happen because they have working equipment).\n\nEither way I need this energy and a more scrutinizing eye for more classes/experiences lol.  It needs to be spread around.  It's okay to trash lazy or irresponsible teachers even if you made an easy A (and when classes like bio 2 are too easy it is honestly probably doing more harm than good but oh well) or even if you think they lecture well but aren't really promoting learning (that actually does happen and when it does it usually has to do with how they design assessments but usually they are the assessment types that many students prefer where an easily earned high raw score really convinces a student that they learned in a meaningful way)  Don't wait until a McKnelly or Berland to go ham and demand better.",

I'm glad I had good SI leaders (LAs today I guess) for the problem solving session.\n\nEither way I think I was lucky and was able to discern because I had good 1st year courses that were a little pushy standards wise so I was primed not to judge as much by how easy/smooth that aspect was.  If I learned and the grading was transparent, I'd be satisfied.  It just wasn't easy to frustrate me with challenging or semi-challenging exams after taking Soria's ochem finals as a 1st year lol.  After him you know how to deal with that or you shrug your shoulders if a low mean assessment doesn't go so hot [because usually that means there is oppurtunity for improvement vs. Easier exams where you need to be consistently near perfect to make an A).  Instead of \"how dare you even put extension items on this test versus just slightly adjusted practice problems. Me screwing up means I didn't learn at all and it's your fault\"  the disposition changes to:\"I won't go crazy if, in retrospect, there was a legit pathway of study that would have helped me make a dent in those harder problems and get a higher grade\".  Hopefully Co25 gen. Chemmers toughen up and go into 203(which has intentionally challenging assessments vs. \"Oops we thought y'all would get a 75 and y'all got a 65\") with that attitude since they experienced lower mean exams.",

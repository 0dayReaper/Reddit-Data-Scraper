I feel this moment should teach folks lessons about highered (and how tuition dependent and expensive it is) in the U.S. and things may need rethinking.   You have this on top of the enrollment crisis that was killing off not so wealth LACs and whatnot.  I personally want Emory to start pivoting in terms of what career paths its students feed into. The new economy will not be friendly to some paths. Like pre-med, Emory may have to consider recruiting less of those because it is awful to have like 60% gain admission because they allow so many to apply regardless of if the app. is competitive. That type of stuff won't cut it in this economy.  People can't be graduated to it with only a powered down bio degree(because they avoided useful classes that built employable skills due to some perceived GPA penalty that often isn't real) that doesn't make them competitive for employment. Advising needs to get stronger or...people will need to be as aggressively weeded from tracks like that as our peers unfortunately.  I feel as if they should be hyping up the natural sciences QTM concentrations in admissions and elsewhere to recruit more students interested in those.  Those folks will be employable no matter what happens with something as risky and selective as medical school.  \n\n These are some interesting times.  I hope the new president thinks of some way through this moment and forward into the future.",

Things like law have been going downhill for a while and I'm sure this will exacerbate it, but to tell the truth I really don't know yet and no one can.  We just know that certain businesses and corporations are others going under and will probably do austerity and automation as a result.  The reason I brought up the standard pre-med bio major is because it is one of the few majors you can arise from with no real employable skills even if you were pre-health, because many do try to take the easy way out and fail and leave with grades and/or test scores not competitive enough for med. school, and many of their research backgrounds are not sufficient for grad. school (nor are they interested in research).  Meanwhile I suspect that more quantitative and computationally focused jobs will remain solid so from a place like Emory, you'll see many social science QTM majors even with mediocre grades better able to leverage their degrees for multiple paths vs. a less engaged STEM major (I expect an \"engineering effect\" from QTM over time as it becomes more established and if it keeps or brings back its capstone course and expands access to the capstone).   \n\nNot to mention that QTM generally is just more interdisciplinary training and thinking.  I feel that some STEM majors like biology may want to seriously rethink requirements to ensure that graduates have relevant math, research, and computational skills that can be applied to real problems and projects.  \n\nLike they are required to take calc. 2 for life sciences or whatever but that isn't project based and they aren't made to build upon it with a computationally or math intensive biology or other courses when those skills could greatly help students later on.  Chemistry could have the same problems but they require students to take so many labs that if done well, they can end up in industry even without formal research experience.  But somehow the university should start thinking of the jobs of the future or about what types of jobs will be more stable that Emory students could access with ease if they are trained and advised well on their options (and if the U establishes good relationships with key companies and sectors). And I'd honestly want entrepreneurialism to take off more among undergrads but lack of engineering sort of puts a ceiling on that energy.  I feel the only way to inspire more of it is to wholesale redesign curricula to have students tackle open ended problems or expanding community based learning and social entrepreneurship based options.  Atlanta is no silicon valley but not the worst place to promote that \n\n*Oddly enough, human health and environmental science have been known to feed students into solid areas that deviate from the standard big 3 (medicine, law, \"business\"(finance/consulting).  It may also be time for Emory to get CS fully in shape when it can.",

And generally many people would agree that students on a track that risky shouldn't put all their eggs in that basket from the get go but that should definitely change by time their GPA is not where it should be and certainly by time they realize they are struggling during their MCAT prep.  Emory certainly has way too many students applying way too early.   The discrepancy between it and other peers' placement rates (including JHU which isn't as high as other elites but still higher than Emory's) suggests something isn't right and I suspect that many of the students applying from Emory are not ready yet (and considering how costly applying and testing is, students need to apply when they for sure have a solid shot) and are going out on a limb because they didn't have a legit plan B or gap year plan so feel \"I just have to try even if the odds are very low or else I don't think I'll be able to do much with my degree or level of training\".  There can be some borderline cases that should maybe try but I doubt with a 50% 1st time placement rate that most of the group that fails are borderline.\n\nAlso I do think other schools set thresholds or more hoops for committee letter support. So.people can do whatever they want but not necessarily with committee letter support from their pre-health office. I don't know what Emory should do, but it should be doing better than what it is with regards to placement and needs to figure that out even if it involves recruiting less pre-med interested cohorts. And no, I have really no idea how to do that other than having more robust special programs hosted by STEM depts that tend to attract the non-premed types at other elites that offer such programs. I mean those numbers haven't moved since I've gone there and they, since then, have supposedly revamped the pre-health office so I am not inclined to only blame them (though I do have my issues as there advising seems more generic and less honest than other elite peers that have higher rates.  Like many Emory students seem to try weird short cuts or strategies that those peers explicitly advise against whereas Emory never even mentions these pitfalls on its website. These other schools have whole 10+ page booklets for pre-healths).",

                                            "comment": "None, I think the average MCAT scores at Emory suffer because of the multi-section systems for the intros. minus physics (it creates a two tier system where like 50-60% of the students who can keep a competitive or even borderline GPA are positioned to kill the MCAT, but the other 40-50%...you have to wonder at times).  The fact is, other schools had similar rate differences from Emory back when they graded more similar.  VU (I'll admit here that VU pre-meds may be less heavily clustered in hardcore STEM majors, so they get a marginal GPA bump that may explain the relatively small, like 10-15% gap) and Hopkins (now they have a 10-15% gap with clustering in STEM majors) have had a similar spread over Emory and they grade STEM similarly.  Northwesten and Penn do too. I don't think GPA is the problem.\n\nEmory needs to find a way to ensure that ALL students are getting a high level training throughout intro. STEM sequences but the lack of standardization in the multi-section system prevents that.  If you could perhaps standardize against the most analytical and problem solving focused intro. instructors , and THEN do your suggestion and relax the B range (or incentivized...say..your Weinschenks and Sorias to relax grading to encourage more students to take them), then you would likely end up with a WUSTL scenario which is very successful because their core pre-med classes afford a huge MCAT bump while also not being too punitive in grading.  Like at Emory, it seems the biggest problems are discrepancies in bio tests and teaching (not content really) which is really important for the MCAT, and having even a couple of joke\"ish\" (especially if the enrollment between or within such a section is 100+) chem sections doesn't help either.  It would also help Emory to get a life sciences (calc. based or not) physics class because the MCAT physics passages apparently use biologically relevant scenarios in passage and free standing. Many schools (even some closer ranked peers) have implemented such a class to target the pre-health crowd.  \n\nI have nothing against math 116 and support it in principle, but calculus ain't on the MCAT.  The pre-med STEM cores should be as analytical and as interdisciplinary as possible in EVERY section for medium/large class.  Also, some depts just need to bring back honors courses. I worry that many AP students come in excited and with advantages, but then things like biol 142 and chem 150 dumb them down over time and make them weaker/complacent instead of being pushed to do higher level problem solving (nothing extreme but more provocative than biol 141/2 and chem 150/202 in its current state) early on.  If you wanna see some students underperform in \"basic\"/\"easy\" classes, bore them to death. Places that can serve their most well-prepped students well seem to place VERY well.\n\nFor example, Stanford's chem 150 caliber gchem 1 actually prevents students with higher than a 3 (or maybe 4) from taking it without special permission (they lock those out of initial enrollment to prioritize those that don't have it, and then make accommodations with the remaining spots. AP credit folks are sent to an accelerated gchem course or intro ochem)!And I think Duke is similar (it has alternative entry pathways for bio and chem and they get really good enrollment by what are obviously mostly pre-meds).  They don't want their students being softer or more poorly trained than they need to be. Emory just lets students do whatever and creates pathways(by letting faculty do whatever, even the lecture track ones which supposedly specialize in teaching and should be able to allot time to challenge AND support that class to help them meet the standards) that allow for students to get poor training (the most elite schools clearly have a lot of oversight so if a faculty runs a serious intro/intermediate STEM course, the dept watches the faculty like a hawk and seems to demand that it remain at a certain caliber no matter who teaches. Emory is like you can have a standard level GSU class and a Harvard class offered in the same semester and that is okay. Most schools don't offer over 1-2 sections of these courses. It is the double-edged sword of smaller class sizes with little quality control).  That is a big problem. If Emory wants to claim \"elite\" and be \"elite\" then its faculty and students should do that. And it actually is for many things, but I always found the way pre-med functions at Emory out of step with most more successful pre-med programs. Fixing grading won't be sufficient to close those gaps. It'll have to get more serious and encourage students to take it more serious and know what an elite caliber pre-med training is and actually have the guts to pursue that.",

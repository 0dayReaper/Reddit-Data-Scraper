Do Emory students (including those at Oxford) only get assigned a major after their 2nd year? How do I know I got into my desired major?\n\n\\- Do the research opportunities differ much from Oxford and the main campus? How quickly can I get involved in the research field?\n\n\\- Oxford's main attraction(IMO) is its small population. Does the small setting really make a difference? What are your experiences?\n\n\\- Can you transfer to Emory between your first and second year if you wanted to?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much!",

I was fortunate to start research about a month into freshman year, but I would recommend you look at NBB projects at Ox and see if anything interests you.\n\nThe small setting makes a huge difference when it comes to both socialization and classes. There are positives and negatives to both, but what matters most to you depends on what you value. For classes/research it means very close connections to professors who genuinely care about supporting students. All of my professors at Oxford have been especially understanding and supportive even more so than my teachers from high school. On that note though the smaller size can definitely give the college high school part 2 vibes.\n\nYou cannot transfer to Emory between 1st/2nd yr but you can graduate early after 3 semesters with a little planning. Lots of people do it and there\u2019s plenty of reasons to do it and not to do it.",

It doesn't really matter anyway as many schools Emory competes with are already in that territory. What matters is if Emory can improve its programs and fin. aid enough to better yield those who are cross-admitted with peers.  Simply having a lower admit rate won't facilitate that since competitors have that as well.  Emory has to compete based upon its \"product\" and not superficial incoming stats.  Those are also converging across top schools. The question is whether or not Emory is getting \"better\" students beyond what GPA and scores can measure. That's the only way of measuring real advancement in the prestige or perceived quality.",

STEMs. At one point ECAS was so stretched that chem actually had to bring in complete outsiders to teach a section and they were awful because there wasn't even time to prep or train them. The recession days were terrible).\n\n When Emory decided to.increase enrollment for the recession period, it made sure to.make room for extra freshmen by say, letting them live in traditionally sophomore dorms.   And eventually Cmont tower was given to sophomores (a significant chunk at least).  What ultimately happened was that room for upper classmen went down. \n\nSelective colleges and universities will go out of their way to cater to first years (again that retention number is important) even if it causes problems down the line (like Emory is so obviously having housing issues which is why the campus master planning framework renderings probably places new housing in the Greekrow area). I imagine public schools (especially less selective ones not as wed to a residential model) are a bit more creative in responding to that. Like many don't offer guaranteed 1st year housing. It all depends I guess.",

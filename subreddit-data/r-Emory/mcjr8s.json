Atlanta campus classes are nice when you want to blend in since their sizes are so large whereas Oxford classes feel more personal as they're smaller so they're nicer for getting more individualized attention and sort of standing out more. There's not really a difference in student quality either, both campuses everyone I've talked to is really chill and helpful. At both students were always willing to explain a concept further I didn't get it the first time and I was always willing to explain stuff they didn't get the first time.",

If my son doesn't like it and transfers to another school, it seems like it would be bad to be from a junior college. Can you clear it up for me?",

Basically Atlanta campus students would get their registration days first then you'd put in a request for a class if it's open after that and wait for it to get approved. With larger class sizes at least for this year they were likely to have space, though it's obviously not guaranteed. Shuttles go back and forth between campuses. Though you are on Oxford campus for only two years and do get an extra graduation as you'd get an associate's degree that those who start on the Atlanta campus don't get, I wouldn't think it would reflect poorly if he was going to transfer later. Since, Oxford and Atlanta campus classes are academically equal. They have to be considering that you both end up at Atlanta campus for junior and senior years either in the regular college, nursing school, or Goizueta.\n\nEdit: Forgot to say congrats to your son!",

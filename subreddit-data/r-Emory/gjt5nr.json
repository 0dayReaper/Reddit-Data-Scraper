Emory has said for months now they\u2019re trying to find a system that allows them to do in person classes\n\nThe NESCAC model is one they should consider. Converting the academic year into 3 trimesters, with students attending 2/3 trimesters to make social distancing easier. Of course, any plans made now are heavily dependent on the virus\u2019s (highly likely) mutation and resurgence in the fall.",

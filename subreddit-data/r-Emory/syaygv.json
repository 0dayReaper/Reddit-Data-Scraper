But it is remiss of any academic institution to not acknowledge a death of a current student, regardless of circumstances.\n\nIf past student deaths are taken into consideration, Emory tends to avoid making a statement unless it is unavoidable. I have no doubt that there may have been on-campus deaths that were not addressed internally (with regards to the student body being informed) because they were able to \"sweep things under the rug\".  The few during my time at Emory -that I was aware of-  all received outside news coverage (local and/or national) and acknowledgment.",

Everyone is criticizing the admin right now, but I'm sure they are talking to the students parents and working out how they want it to be handled, which needs to be a slow process out of respect.\n\n I do wish they had said something already though - even just that a student had passed and not name names. I heard another student (also in greek life) also attempted today, but that is just rumour so please don't take it as fact. whether or not it is true, this is a heartbreaking time for our campus and students need resources, NOW. that's the least they can do.",

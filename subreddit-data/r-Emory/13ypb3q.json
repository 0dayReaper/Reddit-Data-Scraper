    "postText": "So my younger sister got into Emory, one of her top-choice schools \ud83e\udd79 I\u2019m a proud older sister, so I want to surprise her with a little booklet that\u2019s like \u201cEmory On and Off the pamphlet\u201d or like \u201cABCs of Emory,\u201d because my university has a book like that with traditions, lore, etc. Ik I can look up a lot of things like local vegetarian options, but I\u2019d love some more intimate info about the school, local area, fun things to know, places to avoid, best smoke shops lol or whatever you\u2019d like to share. Anything is appreciated \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9b",

    "postText": "As many of you on Reddit may already know, Oxford College has decided to offer a small number of its admitted students spring admission. More details can be found on its [website](https://oxford.emory.edu/springadmit/index.html). Basically, these students are being offered to start their college experience at Oxford in  Spring 2022, despite applying for Fall 2021 admission. The website\u2019s FAQ page states that they cannot begin their first semester of college in Fall 2021, nor can they defer their enrollment to Fall 2022. \n\nAs a graduate from Oxford, however, I strongly recommend NOT accepting this offer for social, financial, and academic reasons. Although Oxford\u2019s website makes the Spring Start appear like a beneficial, well organized program, it\u2019s nothing more than a barely strung together plan that disregards students\u2019 mental health and Oxford\u2019s dynamics as a whole. \n\n**1.  Students admitted under the Spring Start plan are NOT guaranteed to graduate on time.**\n\nOn the Spring Start website, Oxford avoids directly answering the question as to whether or not the Spring Start students will graduate on time. This is because they will NOT graduate in May 2025 with the Class of 2025\u2014unless they bring in AP credits, overload on credits during the school year, and/or take summer classes with Emory. \n\nThis brings an unnecessary amount of stress to these students, especially due to the classes at Oxford being very interactive and having demanding workloads as a result of their small size. A regular semester load is already challenging enough, but can you imagine overloading every semester just to fulfill the bare minimum of graduating on time? Graduating on time is a given at any university, but the Spring Start admittees will have to work much harder than their peers admitted to Oxford for Fall 2021 to achieve that. \n\nAdditionally, despite recommending the Spring Start admittees to take classes during the summer to graduate on time, [\u201cOxford College does not award financial aid for summer term to current Oxford College students.\u201d](https://summerprograms.emory.edu/tuition/index.html) Therefore, you will have to pay out of pocket for summer classes. They are not covered by tuition.\n\n**2. You will be missing out on friendships that have mostly been formed in Fall 2021.** \n\nAccording to the FAQ page on the Spring Start website, \u201capproximately 30 students enroll each year in the Spring Admit cohort.\u201d This is a *really* small number of students when you consider that each first-year class at Oxford has around 500 students. \n\nNeedless to say, the Spring Start admittees will constitute a tiny minority of the first-year student body at Oxford, and this will have social repercussions for them. To begin with, most friendships will have already been formed by the time they arrive on campus, especially since both Emory and Oxford plan to bring everyone back this fall. \n\nSpeaking from personal experience, the people who you interact with online or in-person when you\u2019re first admitted to the school versus once you\u2019re settled in will be different. Friendships drastically change and ultimately become set in stone once the first-year students actually arrive on campus in the fall, which you will be missing out on by not physically being there. You will also miss out on the unique activities that constitute the Oxford experience, such as participating in orientation events and having a PAL (Peer Assistance Leader).\n\nLeadership positions and research opportunities will have already been claimed by the time the Spring Start admittees arrive on campus, as well. There will be opportunities available, but not nearly as many than there are in the beginning of the school year. \n\nHaving a decent social life is vital to enjoying Oxford, as it is located in a rural area with not much to \u201cescape\u201d to. Your social life will make or break your experience there, and it will undoubtedly be compromised if you break into a small, tight-knit community like Oxford late in the school year. \n\n**3. Students majoring in something that requires a sequence of classes will be behind their peers.** \n\nThis includes foreign languages and anything STEM, such as biology, chemistry, and computer science. Introductory classes aren\u2019t always offered during the spring semester, so you definitely have to plan out your class schedule more carefully as a Spring Start admittee. \n\n**4. The Spring Start plan creates unnecessary division within a student body that\u2019s already so small.** \n\nSince its beginning, Oxford has prided itself on having a small but intimately close student body. Oxford has such a tiny yet tight-knit student body to the point where they actually [don\u2019t accept any transfer students](https://apply.emory.edu/apply/transfer.html) (who aren\u2019t much different from the Spring Start admittees) out of the belief that they won\u2019t enjoy the Oxford experience to its fullest. \n\nOxford\u2019s size is what differentiates it from other equally selective and well respected institutions. Needless to say, the entire concept of dividing students into Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 cohorts contradicts Oxford\u2019s philosophy of fostering community and togetherness. Given the stigma of attending Oxford versus Emory, I would expect Oxford to make better, more inclusive decisions regarding its student body. \n\nThe only logic behind their decision to develop the Spring Start plan is that **they want to fill up empty space.** \n\nThis is my theory. A lot of people graduate early from Oxford (many people have talked about this in other threads) for different reasons. It\u2019s a phenomenon that has taken place for several years now. And it has normally caused many dorm rooms to become empty and unused during the spring semester. Therefore, I have reasons to believe that Oxford wants to maximize its profits by having the Spring Start admittees fill up these spaces that the early graduates leave behind. Why else would they not permit the Spring Start admittees to begin their college experience in Fall 2021 or postpone it to Fall 2022, even if they have extenuating circumstances? Gap years are completely normal for students admitted to any university to take, so why is Oxford not giving the Spring Start admittees similarly flexible options? Because they want to make more money. This is their priority, and it shows. \n\nWhat should students admitted under the Spring Plan do then? **They should just commit to another school.** As a former Oxford student, the Spring Plan comes off as a quick money grab, and it becomes evident when they fail to provide transparency about what the admittees\u2019 experiences will be like. This is just my opinion. To the Spring Plan admittees\u2014do with this information what you will!",

            "comment": "Also an Oxford alum, and I work in university admissions at another elite private university. \n\nYou\u2019re exactly right about why schools offer spring admission, but it\u2019s silly to call it a \u201cmoney-grab\u201d or \u201cgreedy\u201d. The school has capacity in the spring to take more students, so it makes sense to do so. If this also gives some students (who wouldn\u2019t have been admitted otherwise) the opportunity to attend Oxford/Emory then that can be a win-win for both the school and those students.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t disagree with what you\u2019ve said about the quality of this student experience vs. starting in the fall. I think there plenty of drawbacks. But again, if it\u2019s this or not get into Emory at all, I would have taken the spring start option. I think it\u2019s important for students to know what differences to expect in starting in the spring, and you\u2019ve brought up some great points about how the school might be failing at conveying that. The school should make that more clear, and ultimately that\u2019s up to the students to make an informed choice about what\u2019s best for them.\n\nFor what\u2019s it worth. I made most of my closest, longest lasting friendships at Oxford sophomore year. Spring starts shouldn\u2019t expect to be pariahs if they start a semester later, though yes it won\u2019t be as easy to jump in and make friends as if they\u2019d started in the fall.",

I know there isn't much information online about Oxford, so I wanted to provide my honest thoughts on this new plan they're implementing.\n\nI call it a \"money-grab\" because Oxford, in my opinion, isn't suited for this sort of thing at all. It's too small and tight-knit of a campus to justify having students arrive in the middle of the school year. It makes more sense for larger institutions where spring admission is normalized and consequently more well structured. But I respect your opinion and am glad you shared it.\n\nOxford is also a fairly selective institution. Many of the students they admit have competitive test scores, extracurriculars, and GPAs (including the Spring Start admittees), so I'm sure they have better options than to begin Oxford in the spring\u2014whether they've been admitted to equally prestigious universities or received scholarships/honors program invites at their state schools.",

If someone is in a position where it is actually good for them to take it and they can manage their schedule, let'm I guess.  I feel like Oxford is likely gonna raise revenue through the need aware aid and then through the upcoming capital campaign",

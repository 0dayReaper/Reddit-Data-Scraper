A few days later, the financial aid office sent out an announcement that they will be reassessing financial aid awards. They took my existing package and simply decreased the grant aid by ~$2400; I saved a copy of my old award to compare because I knew they were gonna pull this shit. I was not at all surprised when they made us opt in to the tuition agreement for access to OPUS.\n\nI\u2019m glad I\u2019m going into my final year at Emory.",

But really I think it\u2019s to goad students into accepting their terms without argument. \n\nFor us nursing students who are finishing summer semester today, our final grades will be released this upcoming week. But we won\u2019t be able to see them unless we say we\u2019re okay with Emory taking all our money no matter what happens Fall semester. That means they could cancel classes, move in-person classes to online, really - whatever they want - and we can\u2019t complain or get any kind of refund.\n\nSpecifically for nursing students, I worry it means that even if those who are supposed to graduate in December are unable to be placed in clinical and graduate, they\u2019ll still charge full price to attend and then make them extend the program and pay even more later on. \n\nI can\u2019t even get in to pay for Fall semester without first agreeing that Emory gets to keep all the money, even if they end up screwing everyone over. I\u2019m hoping for the best, but doing virtual clinicals for the past two semesters has been... not ideal. They promised in-person clinical but haven\u2019t placed us yet and won\u2019t until a few days before the semester starts. I\u2019ll have to hit Agree on OPUS before then to make my schedule is set to graduate. It\u2019s shady.",

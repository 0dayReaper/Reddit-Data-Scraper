    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm currently a research technician and lab manager at Emory. I was recently accepted into Emory's GMB PhD program (super excited!). Because of this, I'm leaving my current position in order to focus on school full time. Because school starts soon, we are desperate to find my replacement so I have time to train them properly to take over my role. As such, my PI has given me permission to post this on the Emory (and GA State, and GA tech) subreddit in hopes that we can get more applicants quicker.\n\nHere are the basic qualifications for the position:\n\n1. Have a bachelor's degree in science, preferably biology.\n\n2. PREFERRED 1-2 years of prior research/laboratory experience.\n\n3. Experienced with PCR and qPCR is a must. A huge plus is experience in cell culture, MICE WORK, and spectrophotometry, although these are not required.\n\n4. Be able to work full time or close to.\n\nIf you feel confident in your basic lab skills (aseptic technique, pipetting, taking good notes) feel free to apply as well!\n\nAs for the workload:\n1. Your main job will be to manage our mice colonies. We have approximately 6-7 mice colonies. For this, you will need to build breeder cages, wean from parents, clip and genotype, as well as euthanize. This is by far the most important aspect of the job. If you haven't worked with animals but are open to the idea, please apply! (I didn't have any experience when I joined either!). This will take up approximately 35% of your time.\n\n2. As mentioned above, you will also need to genotype the mice. This includes PCR with gel electrophoresis as well as qPCR. This is another 35% of your time.\n\n3. The other 30% of your time will be spent helping others with their experiments, ordering supplies, and general upkeep to keep the lab running smoothly. This varies from week to week.\n\nThis job is great to dip your toes into research and to get some experience for future jobs, especially in research and industry. If you think you'd be a good fit, please feel free to DM me. I'll collect your resume and if you're a good fit, my PI and I will reach out for an interview very soon. I can also provide proof that this is a legit offer if needed. \n\nThank you for reading this and I look forward to hearing from yall!\n\nEDIT TO ADD: Also, if you don't think this is a good position for you but know someone who may be, please send them my way. I'm serious, we're desperate \ud83d\ude2d",

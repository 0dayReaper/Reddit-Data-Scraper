    "postText": "Recently, one of the candidates for SGA president was disqualified for not being an enrolled student, while it is unfortunate I do not believe it is unfair. Being an active member on campus and its community is a reasonable qualification. She is now petitioning people to vote no confidence in protest. \n\nBut, voting no confidence takes away presidency opportunity for the other candidates, both of which are also women of color.  They have been present on campus and have more than 2 full years of experience at Emory, which makes them good candidates. A gap year during your sophomore, whether voluntary or not, makes you a technical freshmen, which would also be a disqualification. While it sincerely sucks that this happened and Emory should have made it clear from the beginning, I do believe that they are within their rights to disqualify the candidate. They can run again next year in which I will gladly vote in their favor.\n\nDo not take the opportunity away from the other candidates.",

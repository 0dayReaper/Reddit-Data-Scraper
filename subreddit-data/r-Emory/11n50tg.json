    "postText": "It\u2019s that time of year again when Fresh Prints campus apparel company starts recruiting their next batch of \u201cCampus Managers.\u201d Don\u2019t fall for the scam. \n\nHere are just a few of their misleading claims: \n\n**\u201cThe average Campus Managers earn $8K a school year. Top CMs earn $40K+.\u201d**\n\n*Reality: Mean, median, mode. With 250 campus managers, that could mean the top 10% make $40k, the next 15% make $25k, and the vast majority earn $270. Ask them how much the median CM earns? Or how many CM\u2019s are within one or two standard deviations of the $8k mean?*\n\n**\u201cWe cover all of the costs involved in training you.\u201d**\n\n*Reality: Training is unpaid.*\n\n**\u201cGain entrepreneurial experience.\u201d**\n\n*Reality: An entrepreneur develops/patents a product, forms a business around it, secures investment, hires &amp; fires employees, and is in control of setting the prices and sales territories. Campus Managers do none of those things. This job is like to being a Sales Rep where you sell $x and are paid a % of $x. However, legitimate sales reps usually have exclusive territories or industries, so that reps are not competing with each other. That\u2019s not the case here. You\u2019re competing with multiple other Campus Managers, sometimes in your own organization.*\n\n*You are not running a business, you are not getting entrepreneurial experience. You \u201cmanage\u201d nothing.*\n\n**Don\u2019t fall for it.**",

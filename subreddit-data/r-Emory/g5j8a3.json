People are complaining about how Emory handled this, which may be problematic, but boy some of these other T20/T25s are up to some weird stuff).  They may also be hoping that some of those peers speculate about this issue or make a decision.  My guess is that they can maybe say \"online unless things change significantly\" and then just let recruitment work out however it does (probably won't go well, but time for schools to start considering smaller enrollments anyway because that is probably the future. They'll have to concoct other revenue sources).  \n\n*What I don't understand is why not move the enrollment deposit deadline to a later date to give themselves more time to get enough information to make this determination and give students more time to think.",

The other options for the student include deferring or committing to somewhere that provided no such information.  You could end up with a more \"committed\" bunch who is actually open to taking the L/online stuff at Emory for a semester (and hopefully only a semester).",

Go back and look....just compared to what I'm reading from other peers' student papers and beyond, it does almost appear that Emory did the best it could minus some bad miscommunications.  Some students at peers have had to lobby for (and haven't done so successfully yet) refunds.  One school changed its study away policy for summer courses to all but prevent it...likely as a revenue protection strategy.  It didn't look as bad and desperate as other places to both mitigate the problems, do right by students, and be transparent about what is happening.",

The kinks should already be worked out, and the message to profs should be \"hope for the best but prepare for the worst.\" The issue with declaring Emory will be online this early isn't one of preparation, its of backing themselves into a corner by making the decision so early? What if an effective drug combination is found? a vaccine? What if there is a way to effectively social distance with in person classes? There are far too many variables to make a definitive decision to close this early.",

Oxford would be fine but I think ECAS would be in trouble.  For things like physics and chem, inserting a summer vs. winter break between the first and 2nd half of the sequence could cause content retention issues AND enrollment/staffing problems as they will have to offer both portions of a sequence simultaneously at least temporarily.",

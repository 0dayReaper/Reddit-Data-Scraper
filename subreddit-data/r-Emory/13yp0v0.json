    "postText": "Hello! I'm moving to Atlanta this fall with my boyfriend and cat to start law school at Emory this summer (whoo)! Does anyone have any apartment complexes that they'd recommend? We're looking for a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom unit relatively close to Emory (or on the bus line) that allows pets and has an in-unit washer and dryer (hopefully for $1,500 a month or less although that might be impossible lol)!",

I go to Emory law (2L) but live in Sandy Springs with my SO and dog. I don\u2019t recommend it tho. The drive is brutal. Stay as close to Emory as possible. Good luck.",

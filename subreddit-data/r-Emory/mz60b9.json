I assume the people writing vent posts are mainly searching for solidarity in their bad experiences. Personally, I'm not having the best time right now, but I would still choose Emory again if given the chance. Despite everything else going on, the professors are very good at teaching.",

The school culture is surprisingly deep for such a small campus. On the other hand, Emory ATL felt like it was just work and less about the people around you, so it kinda sucked at first but I got used to it. Oxford was also alot of work, but it felt like you had more of a support system than at Emory ATL, although it was still fine.\n\nThis sub complains alot, I would definitely choose Emory - Oxford route again",

I honestly think my gut was right. I chose Emory over Northwestern, UF, UVA, and UT Austin, just because the vibe of this place really suits me. \n\nThe campus is beautiful (which shouldn't be important but it makes a big difference in my mood), the weather is beautiful, the student body size is a great medium. I haven't had a bad professor yet. They've all been either great or completely fine. Yeah, classes can be hard sometimes, and finals can be anxiety inducing, but that's true anywhere. \n\nI'm not a very picky eater, but I find the food perfectly passable even with my vegetarian restrictions. \n\nWhile covid made the year weird, Emory did a great job handling it and freshman got to have a pretty good experience. Plus, they did an amazing job of getting students access to the vaccine. \n\nI made a lot of great friends first semester, probably the best friends I've ever had in my life. I can't wait for next year when campus life will be normal, because I honestly believe it's going to be so much fun. I already had a great time even with covid. \n\nI know my experience doesn't reflect everyone's, but neither do those incredibly negative posts from earlier in this week.",

I was waffling between Emory and Rochester, though I was leaning so heavily towards Emory that \"waffling\" isn't really the right word. But I've since thought about how different my life would be if I'd gone the other way.\n\nIn short, probably not much. I think I still would have been exposed to a great variety of research, made good friends, and gone to grad school. The only difference is the location, and Atlanta &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rochester.\n\nTo be honest, you'll be probably be fine no matter where you go. A big part of college is trying new things and exploring interests you may not have considered. So long as you find a school that accommodates that, you'll be just fine.\n\nThere's definitely a selection bias on this sub, given that it's mainly people with something to gripe about that post. It's fine that there's a place to anonymously vent, but just take what you see here with a grain of salt. I had a fantastic time at Emory and I was set up very well for my post-grad plans. Couldn't have asked for more.",

Personally I\u2019ve had a great time at Emory so far. All of my peers seem like they work hard and are pretty smart, and that environment helps me want to work to be better myself. It helps that everyone I meet is more often than not kind and genuine. The education is great, too. A lot of people, this year in particular, will rag on the education experience. Any complaint made about education over zoom needs to be taken with a grain of salt, however\u2014I sincerely doubt ANY college has a \u201cgood\u201d education over zoom. Classes offline were some of the best and most engaging I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nAll and all, your college experience is actually just gonna be what YOU make of it. If you make friends and take classes you\u2019re passionate about, you\u2019re gonna have a good time.\n\nEdit: If it wasn\u2019t clear, my answer would be yes I\u2019m picking Emory 100 out of 100 times.",

Even though I\u2019ve always felt \u201cmeh\u201d about being here, I still believe I made the correct decision. Try not to stress about it before you\u2019ve experienced it for yourself!",

Hopefully you enjoy your university experience, especially since you get to be on campus this semester!",

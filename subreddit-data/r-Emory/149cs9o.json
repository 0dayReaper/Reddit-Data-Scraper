    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm a CS student at WashU\n\nThis summer I'm interning with a startup  that's democratizing entrepreneurship \u2014 we're building a platform for like-minded programmers, designers, &amp; founders to build, distribute resources, and collaborate. **The mission is making the competitive advantages of places like MIT and Harvard significantly more obsolete.**\n\nI'm reaching out because we need a few pilot users from Emory University to give our Collegiate Community a test run. If goals are met, we'll acquire 1M users by the end of the year. Pre-scale, we need to test the efficacy of our college network. This entails UX, resources, &amp; support making entrepreneurship a realistic, viable career option, as well as a network of founders, designers, and programmers. \n\nIf you're interested,  leave a comment on this post, or dm this account, and I'll shoot out an invite link so you can see everything for yourself.\n\nThanks!",

Part of the 1M user growth strategy is literally going to be a \"growth hackathon\" with 100k in prizes for whomever grows the largest community.\n\nStarting anything in this space when you're not an existing tech-giant like Twitter or Reddit is supremely difficult. The reason I'm happy to contribute towards this effort is (aside from personal benefit) that the platform genuinely enables people to rapidly build, collab, &amp; scale their startups in a much easier fashion.\n\nPM if you'd like a spot in the trial-run.",

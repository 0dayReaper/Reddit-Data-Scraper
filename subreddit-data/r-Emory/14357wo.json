    "postText": "Hello!   \nI am a transfer student coming in as a Junior and I have questions regarding dorming. \n\n1) Is it recommended to dorm on campus or off campus? I want to make friends and have easy access to campus. Additionally, I've never dormed in a school before so I don't mind it, for the experience. \n\n2) Which dorm is recommended for junior transfer students? \n\n3) If I dorm on the Clairmont campus, will I be able to conveniently bike to campus? \n\n4) Is it difficult to get the transfer housing on eagle row? \n\nThat's all! Thank you! :)",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m trying to find someone to take over my 12-month lease at Campus Crossings Briarcliff (CCB) that starts in August 2023. The rent is $935 per month.\n\nThe apartment is a 3b3b apartment with a common room and a kitchen, comes fully furnished, and has access to the Emory B route shuttle. It is also located walking distance to the nearby Kroger.\n\nThe leasing system at CCB is per-individual instead of per-apartment, so you would only be responsible for the 1b1b portion of the apartment.\n\nIf you are interested or have any questions, please dm me!",

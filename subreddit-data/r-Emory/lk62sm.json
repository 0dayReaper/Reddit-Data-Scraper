My guess is that it would kill the amount of teaching space available (that plan seems super housing and research space heavy).  Schools need at least one token ugly building anyway and Emory hardly has any.  That's white Hall's 2ndary role; to be the out of place brutalist building (Atwood got partly covered up by the new fascade so gets to hid its ugly face)",

Does seem that they are willing to entertain completely gutting Greekrow for housing, redesigning the area around the Woodpec, and adding some new academic buildings across from theology and chem (That would be a good place for a new life sciences building to put it in close proximity to other STEM buildings). Who knows?  If I had to guess, the housing concerns will be addressed first/in the near future and that other stuff will come later (like with research, you'd have to create demand for those buildings which would likely involve developing new areas of research interest followed by recruitment and whatnot). One of the renderings has a \"proposed building\" where bio is (and not the new public health building..good lord Rollins is doing well!) and some don't is so I can't tell.",

From what ik it\u2019s not against the rules for a prof to date their student if their student is not in any class with them. I think they\u2019re already married but i believe we have a real spark and think she might leave her husband for me. Thoughts anyone please? Anyone else tried to date their prof? How was it?\n\nreal advice only",

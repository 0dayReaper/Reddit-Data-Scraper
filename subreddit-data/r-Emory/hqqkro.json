The third paragraph states Emory has no idea wtf is going on/going to happen.",

If there's no in-person classes I feel like tuition should be decreased (not gonna happen in a million years tho). We're paying for access to all the facilities and resources on campus, all things we wouldn't get.",

If I can\u2019t use the libraries and facilities then why am I paying. At the end of the day college is a business and they\u2019re gonna pull every penny from us while they can.",

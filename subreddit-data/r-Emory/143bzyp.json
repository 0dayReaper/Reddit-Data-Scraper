    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI\u2019m an incoming junior transfer student who was admitted into the college but has just become curious about the BBA program. I spoke with someone from the admissions team in Goizueta and they told me that I would be able to enroll in the program next spring but I\u2019d graduate later as I\u2019d be forced to stay for an extra semester. If I don\u2019t do the BBA I just plan on majoring in economics\u2026 as I wanna go into consulting maybe. Do you guys think the BBA Is worth an extra semester at Emory or should I just stick with Economics and graduate on time? \n\n(Also are there any other low income students who are also on full financial aid that have lived off-campus that I can message as I have some questions) Thanks y\u2019all!!!\n\nEdit: These are some very interesting perspectives that I will be taking further into consideration prior to meeting with my advisor soon. Thank you guys so much for taking the time to respond to me and I appreciate any further thoughts. \u263a\ufe0f",

Emory is still trying to fight its way out of \"everywhere else\" level) at Emory for an elite and doesn't have the super concentrated career coaching and professional development infrastructure of GBS. \n\nI think GBS will get you much further unless that extra semester will put you in dire financial straits.  And if you do choose econ, you will need to be a go getter in terms of exploiting whatever it does offer for career coaching an prep so be ready for that.  You will not basically be constantly advertised and coronated with oppurtunities like GBS whose almost sole focus is career development prep vs. theory.",

At Goizueta, they will literally spoon feed you what you need to get a good career. They don\u2019t want you to mess up their statistics of 99% employed after graduating. If you make it into the business school, it\u2019s a no brainer. If not, do Econ.",

It\u2019s pretty easy to just use the internet to help you learn what you need to know and then doing the basics like research, reaching out to people, and being in clubs are outside factors. A business education is completely useless. Goizueta isn\u2019t some great brand by itself or program that stands out at Emory. The Emory name by itself is reasonably strong and will be decently helpful but beyond that Goizueta adds no brand value as say Stern would to NYU.",

What Stunning is saying is correct though. If you want to put in all that individual work, you don\u2019t have to go to Goizueta. I would just rather be taught/ provided that info in a structured and practical way. And be surrounded by other people trying to do the same thing/ get the same jobs as me. I think it helps, but it\u2019s just my opinion \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.",

I imagine there is a paywall but here is this notorious article about UG business education generally:https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/education/edlife/edl-17business-t.html\n\nThe curriculum is not known to be anything inspiring and many faculty from a range of schools (in terms of selectivity and \"prestige\") would even admit it.  What makes schools perform well vs. others is mainly networking and concentrated resources within a career center and perhaps access to certain companies that could recruit students or interface with the curriculum/extracurricula activities. For a few already well connected and super ambitious students, this may add very little value, but it adds an awful lot of value and help for others.\n I don't think many have the delusion that undergraduate business \"education\" is anything special at really anywhere.  It's mainly just a specialized pipeline whose outcomes can be enhanced based upon the relationships (and infiltration) the school and programs have with different employers and institutions.  I am all for the more intellectual aspect of education but I assume the OP is more worried about ROI in which case GBS \"may\" have an advantage in some key areas for most students even if you account for the extra semester.  \n\nI can criticize GBS and business all day long, but it isn't the curriculum or even \"brand\" driving their what I think is actually overpowered placement (I don't think a 2ish year program is supposed to do as well as Emory does) in some areas.",

The fact is, some departments and programs have more robust career coaching and professional development oppurtunities. YOU may have done \"everything\" by yourself but for many, GBS's resources are very helpful and are far more robust than what ECAS's economics department offers, and arguably ECAS career center though apparently the \"Pathways\" thing has quickly begun to improve its functionality.  \n\nGiven the fact that OP is a junior, it may be much harder to make the relationships(professors and otherwise) needed to take advantage of anything that economics offers whereas GBS borderline pushes students into relationships and career prep/coaching via its different events and curricula quite frankly.  One is just more focused on career outcomes than the other and that helps a lot of people, especially a new comer.  Not everything is about \"prestige\".  Some things are about how a speciifc program is run and focused.  Econ is very \"sink and swim\" and hands off on the career development aspect in comparison to a GBS.",

Everyone else was bio/some life sciences major or engineering like biomedical engineering or bioengineering. Most people Ik going to McKinsey from Emory are from ECAS. Goizueta is better for IB/finance related careers/ general business thinks like business analytics or Accounting(Big4).",

Some people I know are into bschool very early but then drop the idea, because if you\u2019re already very comfortable and natural with networking/ job finding then there\u2019s no point going to bschool. On the other hand, people like me who do well on academics but have no clue and kinda need to get spoon fed in terms of networking/ job finding then it\u2019s totally worth it. Overall consider how much the financial pain it\u2019s gonna be for you to take an extra semester and reflect on yourself. Definitely not doing a business minor tho it\u2019s kinda worthless if you can\u2019t utilize the BBA career center.",

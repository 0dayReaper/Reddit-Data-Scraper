This is a high traffic intersection and it almost always has a queue of cars waiting. I also think that Atlanta drivers are too aggressive to be slowed down by narrower roads or other design elements anything short of speed bumps. They currently go 45mph down the 25mph road like it\u2019s nothing.",

There's nothing uniquely bad about Atlanta drivers, as opposed to drivers from other large cities. All are simply products of their environment.\n\nNarrower roads and other non-speed bump design elements \\*do\\* work to slow down traffic. I'm notably a fan of chicanes. Other elements include sharply angled curb cuts and bulbouts.\n\nIt's absolutely possible to give pedestrians the freedom to cross at any time, by programming the traffic light to prioritize pedestrian crossings; set it to instantly start a yellow&gt;red cycle when somebody begs to cross if it's been 60s since the last crossing. (or something similar).\n\nPedestrian bridges are designed to allow designers to keep cars moving quickly while touting that they are helping pedestrians, without taking any actual steps to make it friendlier to pedestrians.\n\n[https://usa.streetsblog.org/2020/09/07/op-ed-why-most-pedestrian-infrastructure-is-really-for-drivers/](https://www.itdp.org/2019/10/01/pedestrian-bridges-make-cities-less-walkable-why-do-cities-keep-building-them/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaking the road safer is definitely harder to do than simply building a pedestrian bridge. But it's absolutely needed.\n\nI also did not address the accessibility issues of pedestrian bridges. Beyond being longer/far harder to use than simply crossing the street if they use stairs like in your pic many of those who can't use them them (people with a broken leg, using crutches, wheelchairs, etc.) are the ones who need safe crossings the most, since they spend the longest time in those.",

I think what\u2019s not clear is that this overpass takes you from outside woodruff residential center to Micheal Street, which has a sidewalk that goes straight to the other already existing bridge that goes from the Bio building to LSM residence hall. this overpass is helpful because there\u2019s no crosswalk that takes you to micheal street or to the bridge, so pedestrians would have to either take a major detour or take the dangerous sidewalk path. Thanks so much for replying with constructive criticism, i\u2019m doing my best to refine my ideas before i propose them officially!",

Memorial Drive to the south in Atlanta was redesigned with many features to make it safer, and it worked. Traffic volume didn't decrease, speeds did. (Travel time increased).\n\nBut good luck. When Emory redesigned the other side of Clifton rd, they prioritized making traffic flow faster rather than safer - with a corresponding increase in crashes from it.

I don't know why those conversations died down) work in the Atlanta area and of course those get limited to residential areas.  People have actually attempted to measure aggressive driving and Atlanta ends up very close to the top and being from GA, I just know that many of the roads in metro Atlanta are already much narrower than most large metros, yet I can tell you that people race down them especially if they are not in residential areas (and even if they are, if there is a two lane road...people are gonna speed no matter how narrow, hilly, and curvy the road is).  You would think the narrower roads and topography in North Georgia would make people drive safer but we know that is not the case (I think the area in and off of expressways/Interstates often has an unusual amount of car accidents).  People basically drive Atlanta roads (even narrow ones with ditches on either side and no guardrails) like they are damned roller coasters or something (part of this might be because the area is relatively low density so people sort of go on a joy ride when there seems to be less traffic. Folks get a little too comfortable because many drives even in relatively high density areas of ATL and Dekalb appear suburban or almost even rural in comparison to similarly situated places in other metro areas.  There are plenty of beautiful drives in N. Ga and Atlanta metro and there is sort of a culture of racing and whatnot in the south).\n\nNext they know it, they are going over a hill or around a curve and some car(or a pedestrian) jumps out of no where coming out of a driveway or something.  Atlanta inner city and inner ring burbs have no grid or serious street plan which adds more danger IMO.  And I think even by other metrics, NJ, NY, and Georgia drivers have been measured as particularly \"not good\" and Georgia would be among those even well before you started getting a lot of transplants from up north.\n\nI'm not saying all these metrics are neccessarily the best or most accurate, but when GA and metro Atlanta constantly come up with \"not good\" rankings, there may be something to it.",

Students will definitely enjoy that...a nice break from \"Kaldi's fascist expansion\" (I actually do kind of agree with that characterization.  Does Emory really need 3 Kaldi's all clustered in the same exact area of campus?) lol",

Agreed with you on Kaldi\u2019s. When they took away Zaya\u2019s for one we were unanimously mad, those 1am chicken tenders were probably half the reason I survived my freshman/sophomore years on the row.",

I am old enough to have witnessed the switch to Zayas and they had a flat out fast food/junk food joint that had amazing tenders (which they could toss in sauce) but also had wings, served a legit breakfast, and delivered to dorms late night.  It was good times.  I know everyone at Emory is obsessed with \"healthy\" and \"fancy\" food, but sometimes a basic old late night fast food option is a classic college experience.  Woodruff would count, but its food selection is relatively bland.\n\nAnd the 4 65 is my favorite as well.",

It should be placed distally from the freshman quad, not only to be outside of Kaldi's sphere of influence, but to make it more inconvenient for most freshmen lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast word:  The original, hilarious, alarmist piece ended up being the right approach as...they ended up trying (now this is great use of hyperbole lol) to poison y'all.

According to the course atlas, ~70% of the ~ 1000 classes at Emory College (exluding Oxford, Goizueta, etc) are online. As long as we\u2019re speculating, I bet they just made the last 30% in-person to get on-campus housing rolling.",

I definitely would not be surprised if this is true though.",

I can't say for sure, but I highly doubt the music department agreed to online lessons/ensembles unless the university gave them no choice. There's too much value in meeting in person for them to do that. In addition, it could mean nothing at all, but chem 150 labs were recently changed from in person to online on OPUS. I wouldn't be surprised if the all online announcement is pending.",

He did not specify if receiving the vaccine will be a requirement for students returning to campus. He noted that the Emory community will still be expected to follow COVID-19 safety protocols from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the fall, including guidelines for masking, social distancing and testing.",

Especially since during our first two years on campus the DUC was under construction, it just feels like our class was at Emory during the worst time :(. I miss my friends and knowing I will probably only get to see them for the first time in a year at graduation and it will be to say goodbye hurts.",

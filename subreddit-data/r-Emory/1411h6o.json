I enjoy applied math more than QSS but I feel like going with QSS will give me more job opportunities. Any advice on potential jobs or advantages for either major?",

Bonus: you can see what kind of companies/internships they were able to work for.\n\nAlso, just do what you like. You\u2019ll be learning it for 4 years. And, Applied Math and QSS are two sides of the same coin. With QSS, you might learn some R and Python, but you don\u2019t need that in your finance job.",

If you\u2019re going for more of a traditional finance career or trajectory, b-school is probably worth it, otherwise it\u2019s more up to discretion.\n\nFWIW, I was a QSS/NBB major who has now worked for two prominent HFs and I have a friend who was a AMS major who worked for a MBB and now works in PE. \n\nBoth Goizueta (and obviously more so) and QSS both have excellent preprofessional guidance and resources, unlike most of the ECAS departments at Emory, so also take that for what you will.",

            "comment": "Why not JUST QSS or AMS.  The QTM dept now has some electives that emphasize quantitative finance and I should also remind you that many top finance feeder schools offer no such major and no UG business degree. They tend to send a lot of math majors, math oriented majors, and more quantitatively trained economics majors. I kind of question the need of having the finance when you can just get the strong QSS or AMS training and leverage resources in QTM to get helpful internships.  \n\nMaybe a business minor?  I don't know. Maybe a finance major with a QTM minor and engagement with many upper division maths?  Really, anything combo or path that will make your Emory experience better because there are multiple ways to get finance jobs that don't involve double majoring in 2 heavy areas that reduce flexibility in your schedule to explore.\n\n  This reduced flexibility may also compromise quality of your training as you'd want to be able to take advantage of having multiple professors offering sections of certain courses and being able to choose the BEST to offer the course in as many scenarios as possible. With those two, your training may be reduced to checking off requirements by taking any old faculty that fits your schedule vs. getting good experiences with strong instruction.  College is really different from HS in how much choice you have per course and how different instructors who teach the same course can be.  There is often only very loose recommendations that only have to do with content and even those are just recommendations.  You'll want to keep that in mind if aiming for post-grad opps that really screen for specific skills and ability to engage certain scenarios and tasks at the interview stage.  \n\nChoose a path(s) that optimizes the amount of quality control you can do with the level of training you get via instructor along with the intensity of your overall courseload to ensure that you can put up solid performances in what may be challenging schedules.  Also consider your work-life balance of course.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone:)\n\nI\u2019m an international student from Korea who will be going on a clinical internship at Emory hospital from July 1st \\~ August 2nd. I'll be going to both the Emory campus (Egleston) and the Grady campus (Hughes Spalding) during my 4 weeks elective.\n\nI was wondering if anyone can point me towards where a visiting student like me can find a place to stay. So far AirBnb and [hotels.com](https://hotels.com) have both been prohibitively expensive (over 4000 USD / 30 days).  \n\nI hope to find a studio or a shared house that I could rent short term(32 days) that is under 1800 USD but max 2500 USD (I'm not super familiar with the housing prices around here). I'm willing to rent a car so I guess it can be a bit far away from the campus. I also wouldn't mind having roommates but I don't think the school program lets me stay at school-run Emory student dormitories. \n\n[offcampushousing.emory.edu/](https://offcampushousing.emory.edu/) has better options but I'm lost with which area is the most suitable for students &amp; if they even accept short term(32 days) applicants. I'm also considering homestay and I wonder if anyone has any experience/advice for this?\n\nAny kind of help &amp; advice would be greatly appreciated, and thank you in advance!!",

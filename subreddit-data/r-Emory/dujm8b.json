Many of us come to study in absolute silence because our dorms/apartments are constantly loud as fuck, and it's insanely distracting/disrespectful when people decide to strike up a loud ass \"whispering\" convo or giggle incessantly for hours on end. There are TWO MASSIVE FLOORS in libs completely dedicated to group work + gossip, so why feel the need to come chit chat in the ONE PLACE where many people can actually be productive for once???? come on y'all this is basic human decency and self-awareness, it shouldn't be this hard.\n\n/rant",

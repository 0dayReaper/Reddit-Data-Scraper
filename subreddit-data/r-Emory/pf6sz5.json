They work so well because you end up seeing the same sets of people repeatedly and you already know there's a common interest to build from. You can find a list of orgs  [here](https://lead.emory.edu/involvement/student_orgs.html) and see if any appeal to you. Best of luck!",

The other person will forget what happened completely &amp; you have so much to gain. You might gain a potential friend AND you get better at talking to people. So worth it imo.\n\nSo yeah, really anywhere. If you see someone sitting next to you in class say hi. If you\u2019re on a long line at a campus event talk to the person behind you if they don\u2019t seem busy. If you see someone sitting by themselves and you\u2019re bored, ask them what they\u2019re doing or if they\u2019d be up for having a random convo. Go to a dining hall and try asking one or more random people if you can join them for breakfast/lunch/dinner. There\u2019s way too much to list and there\u2019s a TON of opportunities where you can talk with people.\n\nBut honestly yeah, just saying hi and introducing yourself when you can does wonders. If you vibe with someone it\u2019s really easy to get their snap/number and ask them to get lunch or to study too. I get that it\u2019s hard for everyone to do this but you don\u2019t have to do this at an extreme. Just be social in whatever way is comfortable \u2014 so long as you\u2019re putting in *some* effort something will happen.",

The clubs seem to be really structure-oriented and people are kinda there for resume building. I\u2019m in the same boat pretty much and lol am just looking forward to going home",

                                    "comment": "Look the first week or 2 of college can be rough and I feel like too many have been sold these often false narratives of instant gratification when it comes to friend and network building that often don't come through. So you need to give it time and avoid first generalizing in a problematic way and then backing off when people point out how certain things worked for them saying:\"I was just  stating my scenario\".  When you open up \"this seems like a whole lot of theory and not application\", that sounds like you're speaking for other people like it isn't working for anyone.   As for clubs, that is a cynical take.\n\n  Naturally some people are trying to build their resume (consider how many students get into these elite schools. It is sort of idealism to assume \"a bunch of just super perfect and passionate people who don't respond to perverse incentive systems go to the most selective universities\"....no they tend to attract those who may be passionate but are the best at playing games that don't necessarily promote pursuing things \"just cause\" and a lot of students' EC profiles were strongly guided or full-fledged engineered by parental figures so you'll have a lot who start off just resume building until they develop and \"find\" their own way in college. College is a development process for most) as well as continue something that they may have enjoyed or excelled at in HS so it'll be a mixture of enjoyment and skill/resume building depending on the type of club. \n\n Like at Emory, obviously clubs (and there are a lot) heavily affiliated with service or specific preprofessional or professional tracks may attract a good share of resume builders. You may want to definitely try something outside of that realm as well as some that are more tied to specific academic areas and departments if you're that type (a person that may appreciate intellectual community) because they tend to attract more intrinsically passionate people.  \n\nAside from clubs, having academic course work outside of standard large lecture (especially the easier/simpler classes among them usually offered as intros for first years) often helps build community or allow for a social component of learning and what others described with meeting good friends in coursework was very much a thing for me and it is more likely to happen if the instructor promotes group work and social interaction in and out of class and is challenging enough to basically force people towards banding together to help each other.  If you view even challenging courses as merely an individual endeavor or a competitive process and don't seek out peers, tutors, etc for assistance then the opportunity to connect to others that way will be minimal\n\nYou may want to go for things that aren't the most popular and you may find a better fit.  Either way it is too soon to make any sweeping generalizations or determinations about what does and doesn't work.  You need to hang in there and stay positive while not expecting immediate gratification. It has only been about 2 weeks.  Some of the things described by others will likely come to fruition for you if you keep an open mind and avoid a overly negative attitude and misplaced cynicism.  It's okay to be sad, homesick, or a little negative for now, but it can't be a constant thing if you want any of the suggestions people are giving to work.",

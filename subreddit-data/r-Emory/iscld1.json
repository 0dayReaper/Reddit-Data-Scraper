The metrics that need to have changed (for the ranking but regardless of the ranking as well) to make it more like the T20 group of privates again have not.   Even if it \"got it\" this time, it would be meaningless and based upon some miraculous methodology change(which it seems like it did actually. Emory suddenly gaining 5 points on a score within a year is weird!) that doesn't involve Emory improving yield, retention, or grad rate which are all supposedly important things if you want to measure popularity and surface level outcomes of the schools.  The addition of graduate in debtedness rank is also a good one and one where I suspect Emory also needs to work on.\n\n Stop expecting anything unless those increase to levels comparable to the other T20s.  USNWR shouldn't even be doing these rankings every year given the volatility we are seeing in some of them(which they seem to create).  You can't really capture what is truly happening to the most important metrics over a year of time.   It'll just have to be 21 for a while while it sucks up the benefits of the 13-25 group of privates in terms of reputation(as reflected in external fellowship/scholarship success). That is just how this stuff works.",

Graduate indebtness is not something we are great at but our retention rate, endowment ranking, and test scores increased so it was likely if the formula stayed the same we would have tied UCLA or moved ahead. Emory has made some very good improvements, you can see it in the undergrad business school ranking increase.",

It suddenly put Emory in striking distance of those others which was lesser so the case.  Just because it helped excellent publics(which always deserved better in rankings for having really strong UG programs, being affordable, while also maintaining ultra strong research infrastructure.  This is impressive considering how much stronger their grad. programs and research is in lots of areas vs. most top privates below 10.  Of course their reputation has always been above their rank for this UG stuff where they were just punished for being big) doesn't mean it harmed Emory. A sudden 5 point shift for Emory is an awful lot and is beneficial.\n\nThat UG business thing has nothing to do with this ranking. The business school is like a silo. Those things you speak of barely increased and are still behind Emory's peers.  Retention and grad. rates have been roughly the same for the past 5 or so years.",

The improvements we made were countered by the change in formula. Us news is optimizing the ranking to help public schools. Us news gives UCLA and UCB their highest ranking. The highest ranking public school on timeswsj ranking is again UCLA at 25. Public schools have a hard time competing with privates across the board. Even when decreasing the percentage of alumi giving, and test scores things that help privates; and increasing debt burden metrics and pell grant metrics, things that help publics, the best they can do is 20. That says a whole lot. There's not much else Us news can do to help publics that wont make the ranking meaningless.",

Before they even moved UCLA into the T20 category, Emory had a rating of 78 and was like 2-3 off from whatever was the 19 or 20 ranked school. Now it's a point away and like 2 points away from private peer. Whatever these metrics are doing, they are helping Emory and UCLA in more ways than harming them.   Really UCB should technically be doing better than either (and really many other privates) but again, that isn't how these new rankings and the metrics work. They still are designed such that it tells these schools \"it is okay to remain the same\" (they just throw in new stuff to shift the scores, keep some afloat, and move others every year to sell magazines).  And fools will take these things as an \"improvement\" or claim that Duke and Caltech are deteriorating or something when none of it is true.   It is all BS and I wouldn't worry who benefits on a year to year basis within this range of schools as it seems to have little effect on their overall reputations and who they attract. Barring some huge shifts in marketing that is beneficial or a Covid based implosion, nothing is rapidly changing to justify any changes we see in the scores or ranks of the schools and Emory probably won't change rank rank in a sustainable way anytime soon, but it CAN fix its financial aid, make the first year experience better, improve academics, grad rate, starting salary, and improve the God awful pre-med entry success numbers.  Only some of these will help the ranking but all are important.",

Cornell fell some spots, WUSTL leaped over them and somehow NU jumped over Duke (which fell out of the top 10 for the first time in a while.  My guess is because they stopped playing the stats whoring games in the same way peers around and below them did. Same with Stanford) and they are still doing some funny stuff with Chicago, Columbia, Caltech. and much of that top 10-12 group (Tech because of stupid stuff and ties went from 28 to 35 in one year!).  Looks like Emory and other schools are better off working on themselves than this damned ranking because it doesn't seem to care about the relative caliber of the undergraduate programs (among top tiers, especially below 10-12, it's a marketing/beauty/admissions momentum contest that has nothing to do with the undergraduate experience and certainly not the caliber of academics at these schools).  A lot of bull is happening.\n\nOther than one school being more \"fun\" and maybe getting more apps than the other, the UCLA and UCB ranking also makes little sense.  I honestly thought Emory would get unlucky and fall a spot or something but I think lately its matriculated student stats have been a tad better than Berkeley (and much better than UCLA overall), so it gets a slight edge. It should be up there with WUSTL, VU, and them but Emory has to work on yield and definitely grad/retention rate a little (a tiny difference in the latter two has a huge effect especially since Emory stats whores less). Until then, it is forever 21 regardless of what it deserves/can be!",

With that being said, can current Emory students give me a rundown as to what they like and dislike about Emory as well as other information that would be helpful for students who are in similar positions as me? Thanks!",

            "comment": "I like the idea of this post.\n\nI\u2019ll start with the good. Almost every single Emory student I\u2019ve met has a great story they\u2019re enthusiastic to share. Emory doesn\u2019t give acceptances to average joe students who just happen to get good grades. There\u2019s an X factor with the students here that\u2019s a lot of fun to uncover. Whether it\u2019s starting a business at a young age, having to serve in mandatory military service abroad, or a rise from a childhood of poverty, everyone seems to have a great story and that\u2019s something that\u2019s incredibly valuable. Emory\u2019s also pretty diverse in terms of thought and background which makes discussion based classes fascinating. Generally, students tend to hold moderate political opinions and are more than willing to hear the other sides (with exceptions with different rival clubs). I find myself learning from passionate students just as much as the professor, and that\u2019s a good thing. In the same vein, most of the professors here care a lot about their students and want them to better themselves academically. They won\u2019t baby you, but they won\u2019t leave you stranded either, forcing you to do the work that will make you a better student and more competent professionally. Additionally, the housing for first and second years is great (except maybe Dobbs) and the food is of objectively good quality *for college food*. Atlanta is an extremely fun city to be a college student in too, there\u2019s always a ton to do and explore. Lastly, Greek life is *relatively* healthy here if you know where to avoid. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t have too many complaints about Emory, one issue I\u2019ve seen is the administration treats Emory like more of a business and less like a college. They do offer lots of services that are helpful to students and improve student life in a lot of ways, but there seems to be a pretty obvious separation between the admin and the students, but hopefully that changes when we have a new president next year. The second biggest con would have to be athletics and school spirit. Students at Emory love Emory, you\u2019ll see that on a tour (if we ever get done with this virus) with so many students wearing Emory gear. That being said, athletic events have pretty low attendance. I love sports and grew up going to every sports game at my high school because that was the culture, but now I really only go to games I have close friends playing in, and that\u2019s just the way it is here. \n\nI should say all of this is incredibly subjective to my own experience and observations. A few commenters on this post may have had radically different experiences, and that\u2019s just how it is. If you have any other questions about Emory feel free to PM.",

Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s for mental or physical health, if it\u2019s worse than homesickness or the flu don\u2019t waste your time walking out there because they\u2019re not equipped for it. \n\n- Very, very pre-professional and the resources reflect this. If you\u2019re not premed (not just pre-health, premed) or pre-business you\u2019re shit out of luck for career advising. \n\n- Hard to get around Atlanta unless you\u2019re willing to spend a lot on rideshare or have a car of your own. Parking passes are expensive here. \n\n- People can be really immature/naive. I don\u2019t know how much of this is from being academically focused or just being sheltered.\n\nIn the middle/YMMV:\n\n- People vape. A lot. Tobacco free campus my ass\n\n- All the humanities departments except for foreign languages are pretty small so you can get to know your professors better. \n\n- Not much of a party school.",

There is a lot of internal pressure to do really well, so you may need help or support. It is not really a \"school spirit!!\" type of place so while people do party and have events, we don't have huge gatherings and varsity sports don't really draw a crowd.\n\nHowever, it does have a TON of resources (if you know where to find them and who to ask), and many wonderful students and professors who are kind and passionate about their subjects and about being helpful. There is a wide variety of events and organizations for you to join, and the size of the school is really nice for always seeing familiar faces, but having privacy.",

Try to join clubs or get like a faculty mentor that helps you navigate college and the \"hidden curriculum\" that many upper middle and wealthy students will know and expect to have to go after oppurtunities and not have them come to you.

                            "comment": "Yes, \"pre-health\" encompasses all the healthcare professions including medicine.   Interesting that you'll be NBB (great choice actually).  Fillipinos, I'm not sure would be treated like say..black students (me and a lot of my friends when I was there) where they (the PHA) would try to steer some of them away from majors like NBB because they were supposedly \"too rigorous\" (NBB does have some challenging courses, but it is a \"good\" challenge.  It isn't like useless rigor.  At least 2-3 of the core courses are trying to teach students to do more than just memorize details about the brain and how it functions.  One is a neurophysiology oriented course that has a decent amount of problem solving, and one focuses on reading scientific literature and writing reviews on the publications.  And there are of course a range of electives distributed across many departments and how they are run/what they emphasize depends on the teacher).  Hopefully they don't try to do that with you.  Also, please don't take any of their advice on course instructors.  Pick the best (ones that provide the best training) course instructors for those pre-med cores. Period.  Outside of physics (and maybe math 111), there will be some variation.  Also, if you are prepared (via AP/IB credit/experience) to double in sciences and have a schedule that makes that feasible, don't be steered away.\n\nWith that said, since you are first gen, Emory has some cool programs for you.  This one prefers pre-PhD/MDPhD students but will take first gen. pre-meds and will set you up with a good network of faculty and student mentors: [http://imsd.emory.edu/undergraduate-scholars/index.html](http://imsd.emory.edu/undergraduate-scholars/index.html)\n\nEmory is one of the few places to have an undergraduate branch of this (most only do it for graduate student mentoring if they have IMSD at all), so if you enroll, do take advantage of it.\n\nIf you decided to attend, the STEM Pathways pre-orientation program is also really helpful and you should consider it (back in the dinosaur ages when I attended it was called HUES lol): [http://college.emory.edu/orientation/orientation/pre-orientation/stem.html](http://college.emory.edu/orientation/orientation/pre-orientation/stem.html)\n\nHere is a little article on it (it extends beyond the little summer program and manifests itself into additional services and a student/faculty network to support URM and first. gen. students): [https://news.emory.edu/stories/2017/05/er\\_initative\\_maximize\\_student\\_development/campus.html](https://news.emory.edu/stories/2017/05/er_initative_maximize_student_development/campus.html)\n\nIn some years, the program actually expands into the curriculum where an instructor from chemistry and an instructor from biology will participate in it to create like a little STEM community for those first gen. and URM students doubling up in chem and bio.  However, I don't know if I'd recommend that over taking say McGill and De Roode for chem and bio respectively.  You can do the latter and still have access to the networks and resources and events (apparently, they sometimes have special study and e-pass sessions for example.  I know we had that sort of thing when the HUEs program existed, and this program is just it reincarnated) associated with both of the programs.  Basically, you don't have to go into Emory cold.  It's definitely one of the areas I applaud Emory's efforts to improve (mainly because I am in STEM so that is what I know about).\n\nSTEM at Emory seems a bit more supportive than a lot of places it seems and programs like this definitely help.  And also having a pretty strong Undergrad TA network probably helps (because upper classmen can end up as mentors to younger students in and out of the classroom.  Usually most schools will only use graduate TAs for things like problem solving sessions).  Probably why students complain less about the pre-med \"weeder\" STEM courses at Emory even though they're, for the most part, are as challenging as many other top 20 or so schools. Relatively small section sizes and more active learning stuff also probably helps more students feel less like it's a competition.\n\nOnly thing I tend to disagree with is the \"one size fits all\" mode of introductory STEM education.  There are no real honors courses outside of math (and chemistry if you wanna count freshman ochem), so what happens for the \"weeders\" is that you end up throwing those with AP and IB credit into the same class with those that have no experience.  That makes no sense to me. The most well-prepared students go unchallenged, and the less prepared students could find it quite challenging, but get hurt by relatively high averages (77-83 or so) due to all the AP/IB students (and there are a lot) pulling up the test/quiz averages and ultimately masking any challenges others may have.  It seems many elite privates below 12 in USNWR have this same issue, whereas those above it do tend to tier their intro. STEM courses well enough to cater to a range of ability levels and needs.  You can sort of circumvent this at Emory via professor selection since there is no standardization among most of the pre-med STEM class sections.",

It was REALLY good and they even let you preview what the type of work/problems were like in the key STEM courses (via like pre-course lectures) meet all the professors, do some professional development events (including seminars and sessions on how to get involved in research). I think Pathways just condenses this programming into less time. And I know there are some on here who did Pathways.  But point is, you get a good slate of programming, and go into Emory with friends and likely some upper classmen student mentors/friends.\n\nAnd yes, there is an application on the IMSD site(http://imsd.emory.edu/undergraduate-scholars/IMSD-UG-Application-2020-cycle1.pdf) Dr. Marsteller is still at Emory and people like Dr. Abreu in bio should also be very familiar with IMSD if you enrolled and wanted to inquire. I think younger students can start off as \"associates\" or \"pre-scholars\" (I do think they offer NBB 299 every year so that is an expression of interest apparently).\n\n*Note that I was also part of a non-defunct program called INSPIRE(allowed us to take more advanced courses and exposed us to research as freshmen and sophomores. Back then, there WERE honors courses.  They need to bring them back) so I had that coming in too.   Something similar to it today is the following, but it targets upper classmen:https://housing.emory.edu/reslife/communities/themed.html\n\nIt is the Undergraduate research and mentorship themed housing.

Following the investigation, the individuals responsible for the misreportings were fired or resigned and the university issued a public apology.[114] The university made several corrective actions in 2012 and 2013, including the hiring of independent data advisers, to ensure accurate data collection and reporting in the future.[115] In April 2019, Emory engendered controversy by allowing a student organization, Emory's Students for Justice in Palestine, to post \"eviction notices\" in residence halls and off-campus housing.[116]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University\n\nRead up on that eviction notice shit.

                    "comment": "Well, welcome to elite schools.  \"Controversies\" (like that type of protest-it was indeed a controversy.  And some didn't like the way the administration handled it, others thought that club should have been able to do it.  Some thought the Jewish students should have reacted the way they did) aren't neccessarily \"wild\".  As for that stats thing....wouldn't be surprised if a bunch of non-top 10s were doing it.  Emory is always just the stupid one that tells on itself and pretends to be ethical.  Even when it was cheating with its stats, it gave itself stats significantly behind most of its peers, which is where it remained after the real ones came out (and it has since picked up ground versus them).  But yeah, these places are desperate for higher rankings. Emory was no different under Wagner and now looks desperate to do so again: [https://emorywheel.com/office-of-the-provost-hones-in-on-boosting-retention-rate/](https://emorywheel.com/office-of-the-provost-hones-in-on-boosting-retention-rate/)\n\nAnd I have a problem with this and how I think it is about to try to get the 1-2% on its retention rate.  I think they are about to invest in a bunch of superficial stuff.\n\n\\*Emory does not have a very wealthy student body compared to many of its public and private peer institutions (even non-peers like Georgia Tech and UGA have comparable incomes and Emory's may be lower than Tech's today, versus this study, since it has gone so hard after low income/QB students since then:\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/emory-university](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/emory-university)\n\nGo compare that to most of the private peers and those LACs.\n\n[https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools)\n\nStill pathethic for all of the elites, but Emory edges most of the privates out by a little bit (it was more significant an edge out 2 years ago when USNWR started doing the ranking and incorporated it into the overall ranking.  Since then, it appears other schools have changed their admissions to try harder to go after relatively low income students. Lots didn't even have over 10%, like WUSTL, VU, and several others didn't have it).\n\nSo try to imagine what they are like.   This argument ends up basically saying \"there are cons going to an elite school if you aren't an elite\" and I agree, but these aren't unique to Emory though.  With drug and party culture: Even at less wealthy schools, drug and party culture is MUCH bigger.  Emory is joke in comparison to its peers and regular degular public schools in that arena.  At this point, that just seems like a stereotype that lacks truth relative to elsewhere (maybe besides a lot of those top tier public and private STEM institutes/Technological universities)",

There are some unique cons to EMORY. Clout chasing, some administrative corruption, and political controversies, and rich kids partying just ain't it.  Most would agree with things like \"Emory has no school spirit and it means you can't have the type of social scene you see at other schools\".\n\nAnd I have some academic critiques myself, but what you put could be said about almost any elite (things like manipulating admissions is more common among selective schools) school or any school school period.  There have been books written about party pathways among more well of students at less wealthy public schools.",

In fact, Emory is relatively tame with regards to that vs. its peers.

And sadly it manifests itself as you describe almost everywhere.  What you (and I) saw was nothing new for Emory or really any college (especially the private schools).

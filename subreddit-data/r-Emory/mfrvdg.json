I totally get that time is finite and that everything should count for something but also there\u2019s a lack of lightheartedness and wacky traditions that I think would boost school morale more than sports or anything else. We take things a bit too seriously I think and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a byproduct of the times or admissions or what but we could really use a campus culture shakeup in some regards.",

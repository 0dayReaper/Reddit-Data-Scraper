Look up chem 150, chem 203 (or 202-Z because Z uses same book as 203), and biol 141, choose a section, look/scroll and click on \"books\" and if there is a book that has been selected, it will display.  Most likely gen. chem will not have one or will not display it because they haven't decided whether or not to have one this upcoming year and if they have decided to have one, they haven't decided on which book.",

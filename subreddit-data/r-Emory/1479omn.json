    "postText": "I\u2019m hoping to transfer to Emory from a CC after I earn my AS. I talked to my current advisor about transfer credits and she told me to contact Emory directly to find out so I looked all over Emory\u2019s website regarding credits. Unfortunately, I\u2019m still confused about acceptance of online courses, I have a few classes that are asynchronous at my current school and I\u2019m not sure if they would make me retake them. I\u2019d like to know what I should avoid to increase my chances of having as many credit\u2019s accepted as possible. \n\nI\u2019m going to reach out to advising tomorrow morning but I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with transferring from a CC with some online courses?",

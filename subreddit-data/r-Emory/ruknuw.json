    "postText": "Was debating whether to post but had to get it off my chest. A while ago, I had a very uncomfortable situation with one of the shuttle bus drivers. Normally, they are all very nice, but I don't know what happened that day. The weather was really bad, and the shuttle had just stopped by CCB. I was going on a grocery run. I asked the driver if I could get in. She said she wasn't moving for another 30 minutes and tells me to leave. I said I didn't mind the wait and asked if I could could sit in the shuttle in the meanwhile to take shelter? She shouted she wasn't going for another 30 minutes, asked if I spoke English (I did and wasn't sure why'd she say that other than that she thought I was an international student), and closed the bus door on me. I stood outside the shuttle kinda awkwardly and she proceeds to ignore me to play on her smartphone. A second shuttle comes by and I walk over to that one, but the guy says it's the lady's shuttle I should get on and he was also confused why she wasn't letting me in/not moving. I continue to stand there awkwardly by the lady's shuttle (doors shut) and maybe 5-10 minutes later, someone else shows up. She immediately opens the door for them, and I walk in too. Next thing I know we're driving off. It was just so uncomfortable. I just felt like shit.",

She dropped me and a friend off in the middle of nowhere because she was tired, didn\u2019t want to drive, and just said her shift was almost over.",

We had to walk to our dorms after that. I do wish Emory had a better way of reporting things like this.",

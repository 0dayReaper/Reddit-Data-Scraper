    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI am /u/PetrosAC and I'm standing for the Liberal Democrats in the South London constituency on /r/MHOC.\n\n/r/MHOC is a simulation of the British Government and we are currently holding an election. The election is essentially us asking reddit users to vote for us on /r/MHOC.\n\nWe introduced Universal Basic Income, a policy which has meant that no one is left too poor in our society. We introduced the Digital Bill of Rights, to ensure that our privacy is respected and not violated and we lowered the voting age to 16, so that a voice is given to those who deserve it.\n\nOur Policies relevant especially to University students includes protecting free speech in Universities and especially protecting research funding.\n\nWe have a strong past record, and I ask you to help me continue it. We need you to vote for us so that we can continue doing the good work that we have been doing.\n\nPlease vote Liberal Democrat here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/4zr812/general_election_vi_megathread/\n\nI also recommend you come join our party here if you're interested!\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/4qf3gl/join_a_party/?sort=new\n\nAnd our manifesto can be found here:\nhttp://mhoclibdems.com/votelibdem2016\n\nI thank you for your time and apologise for the advert - it'll be the only one.",

    "postText": "In the UK Unis thread Dragir had the idea of a kingston meetup.\n\nMy idea was pub and then a comedy night at a local pub (namely Outside the box at the Fighting Cocks).\n\nThe comedy night has won lots of awards, has a student discount and gets lots of big names (One night i was there Michael McIntyre 'dropped in' unannounced to try out 5 minutes of new stuff for a TV charity show he was doing 2 days later). the host is good friends with the mock the week team so they are always on.\n\nAny other ideas post them here, also I don't know when the first years start (I know there is a redditor about to start) so we need to arrange a date.\n\n[Outside the box](http://www.outsidetheboxcomedy.co.uk/)\n\n[Fighting Cocks](http://www.the-fighting-cocks.co.uk/)",

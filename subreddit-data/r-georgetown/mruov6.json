    "postText": "I am going to be taking physics 1 (Prof Doughty) and 2 (Prof Johnson) with lab as a rising sophomore this summer, and I was wondering what kind of experience I should expect? Is it manageable? Is the grading harsh? I took Calc AB and BC in HS, but I only remember some basic calculus. I have also had some experience with algebra-based physics in the past. Is there anything I can do to prepare for the class?\n\nPlease feel free to comment or pm me!",

            "comment": "First, go on Google and search \"Georgetown undergraduate courses.\" Scroll down to Principles of Physics I and II. Download the syllabus and familiarize yourself with the categories, schedule, and etc.  I took it in the summer last year. If it is virtual, the labs and recitations are free As because its just worksheets that guide you through the recitation/lab. When you meet your group in lab/recitation, don't be shy and stay muted/off screen for five minutes until someone decides to say hi. It is a waste of  time and when you are taking such an intense summer course, there is no time to waste on being shy. You are all in the trenches and in order to survive, you better make the most out of your time. In terms of lecture, Professor Doughty is a good person but not a good professor at all. Lectures are 90 minutes and she mixes concepts with theoretical examples and its just confusing asf. Sometimes she doesn't even get to cover everything so you have to spend some off time listening to the rest of the lecture. There are these weekly problem sets she expects you to do but there's no clear instructions, a lot of the questions are theoretical or up to interpretation and if you get it wrong, you get it wrong which is bs. There is a website that comes with the textbook that you have to buy. Every week there will be problems that you have to complete for a grade. It is good practice but sometimes the system wants a specific answer Ex. 50.1 instead of 50 some bs like that. Sometimes problems will feel impossible so get a Chegg. Don't spend hours being stuck on one problem, its not worth it. Just know that it is a grade at the end. In terms of grades, your decider will really be your exam grades, they are a big chunk. Exams are 90 minutes, 5 scenarios but each scenario has like a.b.c.d.e.f. questions. It is open everything except classmates. You can choose to take it in the morning or afternoon in the pre-course survey. For semester 1, the exams did not reflect her examples in class and she showed no empathy towards test corrections or anything of that sort. For semester 2, its the same thing in terms of exam style but the exams are more reflective of what is taught by professor Johnson. He is one of the most caring and helpful professors during class and office hours truly. The way he does lecture is that there are recorded lectures that go over content/fundamentals of a problem and then during class time, he will go over scenarios where you apply the concept. Lecture time is only like 40-50 minutes which is great but thats also because you have to spend time watching pre-recorded lectures. In my opinion, if you want to do well for physics over the summer, you have to dedicate each day to physics. You can't get a part time job, take other classes, or do research. Your summer is for physics and physics only. Because you are taking lecture and lab, that's already like 2-3 hours of your day gone not including sleep, eating, and w/e else goes on in your life. Between the end of finals this semester and the start of summer classes, there is probably a good 2 weeks in between. You can decide what to do with it. If you feel burnt out by this semester, take some time off and do w/e helps you relax but don't take the two weeks unless you really have to. In terms of getting a head start, remember to download the syllabus so you know what topics are covered week 1,2,3,4 etc and daily. Watch the organic chemistry tutor on youtube, goto this website called [chadsprep.com](https://chadsprep.com). Purchase the entire 2 semesters because the guy gets to the point in each topic, theres tons of practice after each lesson for active learning purposes and there are even practice exams, what else can you ask for? Of course, if you don't want to spend money, you can just watch the videos for free. Oh btw, if you find yourself in a situation where its 2:00 am in the morning, you're not getting the material, the exam is in a few hours, and you know a friend in the class and you want to work together on the exam. I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU DON'T DO THAT. If you get honor counciled, everything you worked for will be gone if they find you in violation. Even if in the end you don't get found guilty, the entire process takes like 3-4 months from the day you get an email saying \"you got reported\" and the day where the hearing takes place and they decide your fate. In between that time in the fall, you're not gonna be in a good mental state because you know you've just jeopardized your entire future over one exam grade. Anyways, thats all I can say about the course. Whatever you choose to do in the end, make sure you do it with no regret and just remember that actions have consequences and however you decide to utilize your time in the summer, time only moves forward.",

I just want to make sure the exams aren't extremely difficult even after using all the resources you mentioned. How does the exam difficulty relative to the lecture content compare to other science class ( I taken gen chem 1 and 2 and Human Bio 1 and 2 and found both to be easy)? I",

For physics 1, it might be harder but like I said, reviewing the topics according to the syllabus on [chadsprep.com](https://chadsprep.com) and the organic chemistry tutor online should give you strong fundamentals going into the class. I would not say its impossible to get an A, and based on how you did in the other general science courses, I am confident you can do well in physics 1. If your exam scores are maybe a bit lower than average or someone aces it every time, it can be a little bit discouraging but just know that you actually know the content and are not collaborating on the exams. Yes, the averages are gonna be inflated due to cheating and there's nothing she can do about it since its probably gonna be online. If you end up with a B first semester, don't get discouraged. Its not you, its just the professor. As long as you do well in second semester which I'm sure you will, it will be fine since med schools want to see improvements overall.",

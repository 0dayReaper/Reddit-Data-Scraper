    "postText": "Hi! I also got some questions but the word count has exceeded the maximum so I start a new post here:\n\n1. I know Georgetown does not allow a double major across school so it's impossible for me to get a MSB degree. Does that greatly limit your access to banking (especially the top IB and BBs) ? I saw on LinkedIn that there are quite a few non-MSB graduates now working for top BBs like Goldman Sachs but it seems that we don't have that much in recent years.\n2. How hard is it to double major/minor in other disciplines at GC? I may want to pursue a CS/Maths double major later on? Do they also require an application or it's just finishing the form and everything's done?\n\nAll information/help/advice provided are greatly appreciated!! :)",

I don\u2019t think it will limit your access but you should prepare for interviews with a good reason (i.e. not money) for why you want to work in finance but not major in it. Interviewers will probably quiz you on basic finance/accounting concepts so take some of those classes if you can and make sure to study before the interview. \n\n2. No application afaik just take the right classes",

            "comment": "It's still definitely possible to break into IB if you aren't in the MSB, but will require more self-studying in order to learn basic accounting and finance concepts that are usually covered in interviews. Sometimes, having a non-traditional major (i.e. not a business or econ major) can help you stand out. If you are really set on IB, you could also apply for an internal transfer to the MSB. That's what I did my sophomore year and it definitely made the recruiting process easier because I felt more comfortable with my business knowledge. As for double majoring, definitely possible if you know early on that that is what you want to do. Not sure if there's a specific application/permission you need to double major, but assuming it's the same process as declaring a single major, you basically just fill out a google form, no questions asked.",

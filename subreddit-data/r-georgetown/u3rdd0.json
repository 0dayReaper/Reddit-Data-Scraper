    "postText": "I'm a rising sophomore and have a couple questions.\n\nWhy is SWQ considered better than Village C? I would expect in-room bathrooms to be a major plus, especially after being renovated. \n\nAlso, are there any notable differences between the SWQ halls? And out of the VCs, VCE is definetely the best, right?\n\nAny extra advice is welcomed.",

            "comment": "Southwest Quad is newer and cleaner, I can\u2019t speak to any renovations that have taken place. But either way, the VCW/VCE rooms are tiny. There\u2019s also probably still a stigma from when VCW was a freshman dorm and VCE was freshman overflow and sophomores who never got their shit together to get a better place.",

VCE is better than VCW (bc elevator and overall jankiness, plus laundry is in the same building). i heard that in SWQ, there can be vomit in the bathrooms after the weekend and to me, private bathroom is better than space (average is 200 sq ft)\n\nalso to the comment where they felt their room was draining, my roommate and i have our beds bunked together, and it really brightens up the room and makes studying inside better",

            "comment": "Current VCE resident here. The room size is the big factor. You have so little space that spending time in your room starts to become draining. You will almost certainly come to resent your roommate. Hosting? Forget about it. The bathroom is a plus but the downsides are sizable.",

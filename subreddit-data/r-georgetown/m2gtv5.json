This isn't news, it has been happening in top tier law schools and undergraduate programs for a decades.  \n\nI recall Yale Law School had a big on campus demonstration back in the early 90's when the admissions office mistakenly provide a student doing a research paper the GPA and LSAT scores broken down by race, and the student leaked them to others.  It showed that the university was significantly dropping the bar for black applicants.  Hell go look at the Asian students lawsuit against Harvard University where Harvard was forced to provide GPA/SAT scores by race.  The blacks admitted were significantly down compared to other races.  \n\nThe simple fact is you would expect to see what the professor claimed was happening to be true.  When you let in people that are below the same standard as other students you can't expect those students to magically start performing at a much higher level.   Frankly I hope the professor sues the university and uses discovery to shine a light on just how much the admission office has lowered the bar.  \n\nPeople may not want to know the truth, but that doesn't change the truth.",

As I recall in law school we put a number that we had been assigned on exams so no professor knew who wrote what when they were graded.  And it is an open secret that GPA and LSAT scores for blacks are much lower than for other racial groups.  In most highly competitive schools the Asians are the top performers in GPA/LSAT, whites in below that native Americans and hispanic below that, and then at the bottom the African Americans.  It is what it is and so long as law schools operate on their diversity/inclusion quota systems where you generally see the same demographic profile or each years class mirroring the one before, you will have this happening.  It would be quite an eye opener if the law schools would start doing blind admissions with only the GPA/LSAT, essay questions used and not interviews, and someone to kick out any application that tried to provide insight into the applicants race.  I wonder how many law schools would suddenly have a much different demographic profile.  And wouldn't it be for the best to have the most deserving students in those elite schools instead of the ones that were simply born with the right color skin?",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm considering applying for transfer this upcoming cycle.\n\nOne thing I can't find is whether or not Georgetown has accepted nontraditional students. From my research, it appears that some colleges look for older students to add diversity to their campus, but other colleges find that nontrads would not be a good fit for their student body, accepting virtually zero. If there are no nontraditional students at Georgetown, I don't think it would be worth my time to heavily research the school and write essays.\n\n**TL;DR:** Have you ever met an undergraduate student over 25? I found one article about a 63-year-old undergraduate, but nothing beyond that. \n\nThanks!",

When I was in undergrad 9 years ago, I was majoring in International Relations and will be coming in with 117 credits (for which GU will only accept 60). This time I will be studying Computer Science. I am still in shock. The point is apply 'cause you just may be exactly what they're looking for. Good luck!",

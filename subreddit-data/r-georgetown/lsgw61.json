The hybrid experiment this winter isn't going well, and even without classes being offered in person numerous students on campus (eg athletes) are testing positive. I teach 80 undergrads online right now, most of which are off campus, and I already have had 2 students in quarantine because of infection. Grad experiment with hybrid is going much better, though students take a lot less advantage of the in person option than expected. \n\nWe all have our preferences. I'm a professor and I'm getting vaccinated Monday. Even then, I would not be comfortable going to a physical classroom at least until the fall. But then, my classes are going pretty well online and I have risk factors at home to consider (ie being vaccinated doesn't mean you can't carry the virus home to someone who isn't vaccinated). \n\nI can't wait for this to be over!\n\nEdit: 3 out of 80",

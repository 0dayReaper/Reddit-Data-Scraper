It is good for the conference for the other teams to do well but Hoya fans should be upset at the idea of Nova or UCONN winning a title. Do you think Yankees fans root for the Red Sox in the World Series or Redskins fans root for the Cowboys in the Super Bowl out of loyalty to their division?   \n\n\nAfter the Hoyas, my second favorite team is whoever is playing against Syracuse. Whoever is playing against Nova and USUCK also rank amongst my top 20 favorite teams. \n\nIt would be different if it were Marquette, Creighton or almost anyone else in the conference.",

I don't feel the same way about St. Johns, or UConn or Seton Hall.  I am rooting for the Big East.",

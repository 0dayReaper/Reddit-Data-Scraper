It\u2019s even weirder because I\u2019m not even Catholic or Jesuit. \n\nI grew up edgy and athiest though I felt like I grew into religion as I was part of an all-girls Jesuit Catholic high school. It was such a great experience and I just know that schools with Catholic affiliations just have great support, vibes, empathy and values. \n\nI know the urbanism of DC and the demographics of polsci students might just have diluted these values? What do you think?",

I was in the large majority of students.\n\nTo have a religious experience at GTown, you need to search it out.",

            "comment": "Yes, you will hear some references to \"Jesuit values\" as it seems you have at your high school and I do think a good number of people exemplify them in reality. There are also a good number of Jesuit chaplains on campus although many from other denominations as well. Georgetown was the first in the country to hire a full time Rabbi and later a full time Imam. There are also Hindu and Buddhist chaplains: my point is that religious diversity is a thing, and there are doubtless plenty of agnostic/atheist students and faculty on campus too. As you probably know, you also have to take two theology classes.\n\nAll of that said, most days I forget I'm at a Jesuit school. It's not like Catholic U across town where there are guards preventing men and women from entering each others' dorms. If you want religion (any religion) to be a big part of your experience it can be, but for most students it probably isn't.",

Want to major in theology and get super involved with campus ministry? Dope you do you. Want to take your 2 required theology classes and never deal with religion again? Also very fine. I did the latter but I know people who did the former and it\u2019s totally chill either way. In other words it\u2019s there if you want it, and if you want it it\u2019s a very robust Jesuit/Catholic/religious experience",

            "comment": "You might know this already, but the Jesuits are the least catholic of the catholic orders and lean extremely liberal in their values. This is reflected in a lot of student life at Georgetown. There is really nothing in Georgetown\u2019s student life or rules that suggest religious values or catholic dogma influenced them in any way. Perfect example - dorms. Notre Dame has single sex dorm buildings and limitations on opposite sex visitors after certain hours (yes they seem oblivious to the fact they have LGBT students who are unhindered by this rule). Boston College dorms all have single sex floors. Georgetown has all coed dorms with coed floors (excepting a couple of self-selected single-sex floors), and no limitations on visiting hours. The only thing I can think of where religious values impact student life is that the university does not offer students contraceptives (condoms, birth control, plan B) in university owned stores or university run services. Given there\u2019s a drug store 6 blocks from campus this amounts to more of an inconvenience than anything, and there\u2019s also a pro-choice student group that offers free condoms and Plan B.\n\nJesuit values show up in more secular ways - it\u2019s less about imposing religion on people or pushing a catholic dogmatic agenda and more about emphasizing Jesuit values of empathy, service, intellectual pursuit, etc. in whatever it is you are doing in school or in life.",

                    "comment": "Well, except that no student organization can advocate for pro-choice, which is why it\u2019s called H * yas for Choice, not Hoyas for Choice, cuz that org isn\u2019t registered at Gtown and can\u2019t use the word \u201cHoya\u201d. You also can\u2019t buy or find condoms at stores and the health center on campus, although H * yas for Choice always has a table set up in Red Square and has some free ones for you to take. And then there\u2019s also this student org called Love Saxa that says it advocates for traditional Catholic family values. What that means is that it\u2019s effectively an anti-LGBTQ student organization. There was a big controversy with the Student Activities Council about canceling school funding for the org (every student org receives funding from the school while the school gets that money from the \u201cActivities Fee\u201d that students pay as part of their tuition). I don\u2019t think Love Saxa got its funding stripped, last time I checked, although I could be wrong.\n\nBut these matters aside, I agree with another comment here that says it\u2019s as religious as you want it to be. The school doesn\u2019t shove religion down your throat AT ALL. And the theology classes they make you take are all very liberal, as in the professors will encourage you to come to your own conclusions like any good professor should. Given how important religion is in our world today, it\u2019s honestly quite nice imo that Gtown requires these theology classes cuz otherwise I don\u2019t think most students would have taken them, instead they\u2019d miss out on some very good lectures.",

Like everyone has said religion is as much a part of your experience as you want it to be.  \n\nI personally think the catholic community is wonderful. The Jesuit chaplains are all awesome, Sunday mass in dahlgren chapel always made me feel energized for the week ahead and the whole community is really welcoming. There are a bunch of ways to get involved with Catholic ministry and some very close knit Catholic student organizations as well. \n\nI don\u2019t think the catholic nature of the school is \u201cdiluted\u201d because of DC. I will say Georgetown and the Jesuits are very liberal and social justice oriented so if you\u2019re looking for something more conservative then Georgetown might not be the Catholic school for you.",

I just graduated Georgetown and I would say that if you want to have a religious experience, it's incredibly easy to, but it's not something that is just present for you. The Catholicism at Georgetown is more hands-off with the exception of the Jesuit values (which are pretty universal) so you do have to put in a modicum of effort to be religious. \n\nCatholics are the largest religious group on Campus so there will be more events and organizations related to Catholicism on campus. Sunday Mass is always well attended at Georgetown. I went through RCIA at Georgetown and that was an incredibly positive and fulfilling experience for me. There are also smaller student groups for Catholic students to hone in on more specific religious needs like Faith Discussion groups which I thoroughly enjoyed.",

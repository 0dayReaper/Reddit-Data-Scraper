Realized I didn\u2019t have any interest in politics after an internship on the hill and now am pursuing a career in natural resources. Georgetown is a great school and DC is an awesome city but I am definitely happiest in a rural area",

The type of people attending our 70k/year private Catholic university are far different from those I've met when I've been to state schools (70% of the population isn't from NH, CT, or NY). If you didn't grow up in the Northeast, aren't an athlete, and are introverted/socially awkward, it is far harder to find friends here than at some other university.",

I'm wondering if anyone here is currently enrolled and/or completed the degree and can speak to their experience + how it's helped them in their careers. It seems like a degree right up my alley coming from someone who studied business analytics in undergrad. Any input helps. Thank you!!",

The School of Nursing &amp; Health Sciences was the basis for all of Georgetown's online programs. All of the lectures were prerecorded, and I could go at my own pace. In-person class time was used for discussion and questions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour program is not the same. But I found that I could digest the information more thoroughly than in-person listening to a lecture live.",

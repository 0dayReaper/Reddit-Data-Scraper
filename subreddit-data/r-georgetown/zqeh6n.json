Seems like they gravitated here for a reason; Gtown seems to treat veterans well.\n\nSearching on LinkedIn for Georgetown students or alums with military experience in their profiles/resumes might be a good venture to explore. Hoyas are usually pretty responsive to networking on there and answering questions.\n\nGood luck!",

Historically there has been a disproportionate # of Gtown MBA vets from SOF that it has been joked at SOF U, but I think it has evened out lately. As for outcomes, it\u2019s interesting. I would say vets generally occupy the top of the most competitive jobs. That being said, I would also say 20% also hit the bottom of the competitive job curve, and they are the ones that didn\u2019t take advantage of their grad school opportunities well.\n\nDM me.

                            "comment": "Let's break this down:\n\na. Half of this 20% elected to seek the least competitive job for work life balance reasons, this included some academic/resume studs. They just wanted a 9 to 5 and a decent income to take care of their family with no real ambition to make big bucks or get a C-Suite title. I kind of respect this group actually.\n\nb. The other half of this 20% is what is really concerning. These are vets who shot really high (some even got the Goldman or BCG interview), but weren't able to land the the job offer. I would say everyone in this group came in with a pretty rock star military resume - including SOF guys, top block on fit reports, highly competitive premier billets, service academy grads, and etc. However even if they were nice guys (and some of them are my good friends and some would later rebound post MBA), during MBA, they didn't take the program and recruiting seriously. They had the attitude that their awesome military record would speak for itself, and they didn't need to do the hard work to prove themselves after XYZ hard military experiences. So they didn't pay attention to class, prep for interviews, or modify their language to a civilian audience, and/or fix their weaknesses in general. Their ass just got bitten with rejection after rejection and they had no choice but to take the bottom of the barrel job available to them. By bottom of the barrel, I mean one of three things:a. Under leveling in general (so starting off at a lower level than typical for post-MBA)\n\nb. A non MBA seeking role (so a role that isn't an MBA pathway role or MBA preferred)\n\nc. Uncompetitive roles (sometimes these can pay well and level well, but its by companies that aren't exactly the hot brands - as in your friends and family have Google what the company does)",

Now the increasing cost of tuition might of dulled that effect a bit. The VA yellow ribbon website for McDonough (the business school) you tell you how much Yellow Ribbon and you can do the math.\n\nI will say that most veterans paid 0 tuition because back when I went when yellow ribbon didn\u2019t cover up to 100%, they would give some minor scholarships to cover the difference. Those who did pay paid like $10k a year or so, and they did so because they were academically on the lower ends of competitiveness.",

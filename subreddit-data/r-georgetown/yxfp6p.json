My question is if anyone has any thoughts on the reputation of the program and is it connected to the main campus? I know it\u2019s a relatively new program so I just want to know if it\u2019s legit or a money grab",

The School of Continuing Studies is just a separate school/college from the McDonough School of Business or any of the other schools/college on campus. I don't remember what the political science department/school is called at Gtown, but there basically are two parallel groups of students studying what you want to study -- some of them are in the political science department or whatever, and others are in the School of Continuing Studies. \n\nI think there might be different professors teaching in SCS vs other other Gtown political science department. Other than that, there's little/no practical difference between SCS and everything else. I wouldn't worry about it too much.",

But if you have a passion for the material, who am I to judge. I enjoyed the few courses I took here, but pound for pound, it made no sense.",

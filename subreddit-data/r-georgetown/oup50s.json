Obviously, I realize that they\u2019re harder than the standard language class, but I\u2019m a freshman this year and really have no context or clue. \n\nCould somebody describe or give me an example of the rigor that one of these courses exhibits?",

You spend so much time with your professors and classmates I found I picked up new vocabulary and skills really easily. So it\u2019s definitely more intense, but no more than taking the equivalent of two other classes (which is what it is really).",

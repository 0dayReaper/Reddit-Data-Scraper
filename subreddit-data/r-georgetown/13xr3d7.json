Should I take my gen ed's first? If so, which qualify? I'm a prospective political econ major, and want to know how I should format my years coming into Georgetown. Thanks a bunch :)",

            "comment": "I would reach out to your dean for more specific advice but generally speaking it's good to take maybe 2-3ish core classes a semester + the rest exploring potential major/minors esp as a prospective PECO major! You can see on the Georgetown schedule any restrictions (pretty much all of the introductory gen-eds should let you enroll, though some may be already filled up by upperclassmen)!",

Feel free to PM me with questions about specific classes, I happen to be a gov major with all my close friends in the SFS :)",

            "comment": "Yeah it\u2019s a good idea to start early! you don\u2019t want to be a senior stuck in problem of god. Something I wish I knew was they save a bunch of seats in Science for All classes, so you don\u2019t have to struggle to get into a class for that credit (unless you\u2019re in the last registration haha). I would recommend taking a Theology (problem of god or intro to bib lit) and/or science for all credit to get some core requirements done. I very much recommend doing a language class unless you think you have proficiency already. Consider an intensive course if you know you need language credits and aren\u2019t sure what other courses to take. Don\u2019t take too many credits! 15 is good\u2014 then you can still drop one if you hate it haha. With your remaining open credits take a class to explore what you\u2019re interested in. If that\u2019s political economy take a govt or Econ class. I will tell you intro to micro/macro econ are big lecture classes that are easy to get into so if you have a early sign up maybe look into govt and if you don\u2019t then you can bet on taking econ. Hoya saxa!",

Check ratemyprofessor and don't take a gen-ed with a shitty one to just \"get-over it.\" Gen eds can be easy As if you take the right class.\n\nAs a current econ major, I would recommend you get started on the major requirements (ie Principles of Micro or Macro).\n\nOh and, like another user mentioned, get started on your language credit unless you are able to test out.",

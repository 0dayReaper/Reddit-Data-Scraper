    "postText": "Hello! My friends and I (all seniors) are looking to get a Vil A this school year. My roommates are a little concerned that noise from the rooftop parties will be very bothersome, however. Since my memories of Vil A parties is from over two years ago now, I don't really remember how rowdy the parties got.\n\nI am fully expecting the party noise to be very audible throughout the whole complex, especially if you are outdoors or you have a window open. Can anyone speak to how loud the noise got in the bedrooms in the past, particularly the ones in the second floor units nearer Prospect and farther from Library Walk?",

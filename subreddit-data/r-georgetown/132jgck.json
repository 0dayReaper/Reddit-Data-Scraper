    "postText": "okay so right now, i'm a freshman at the university of iowa, and i hated it so much the first semester that i applied a bunch of places to transfer that were closer to my home, georgetown being one of them. a bit into the second semester i started getting close to some people here and enjoying it a bit more, and i figured it wouldn't be an issue because there was a pretty low chance of me getting into georgetown which was the only school that i'd transfer for. well, flash forward to a few days ago, and i got accepted into the school of foreign service as a transfer!! which is so great!! so very exciting!!! except now i'm struggling to decide what to do.\n\nbasically, i now have a strong friend group at iowa, i'm part of the mock trial team, and i'm in the middle of creating a disability cultural space here (it just got approved). i already have my roommate for next year lined up and i don't want to disappoint her. i've also got another year in my internship (although this is less of a big deal since i was only initially hired on for two semesters). i volunteer at the salvation army here and it's some of the most amazing people i've ever met. i'm really struggling with justifying leaving all this behind. how am i just going to drop the very projects that got me into georgetown in the first place?\n\ni'm also worried, coming from a state school in the midwest into a prestigious private school in dc, that i'm going to be crushed under the weight of my imposter syndrome, or that i'm not going to fit in, or that i'm going to hate everyone, that i won't be able to stand out, that i won't be able to shape up to everyone around me, or that it'll end up costing too much.\n\nso i guess my questions are as follows: is georgetown worth it? how have your experiences on campus been? if anyone else is a transfer student, how was the transition? is the campus filled with rich, white, power-hungry assholes? am i going to be able to make friends? is it very competitive?\n\nalso just generally, what are your favorite and least favorite aspects of attending georgetown?\n\nif you've made it this far, thanks for reading!",

You can find other people but that is the majority of the school. People tend to be a little \u201crougher around the edges\u201d in my experience.\n\nOne thing to consider is field of study. SFS would be very advantageous to be in DC. Grad school would be very advantageous you started your own club and volunteered etc.",

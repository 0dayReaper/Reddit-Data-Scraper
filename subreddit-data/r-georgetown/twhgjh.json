Then, you can coordinate with him/her. about splitting what you want to bring. GU used to have vendors on campus during New Student Orientation with room-sized rugs, posters, mini-fridge rentals, Visa/MC, banks...pretty much an open-air market for all you need! and the prices were fair. I have no idea if this is still available, but you might wait and check it out with Housing or NSO. You'll be hearing from a number of on-campus offices, so be assured you do not have to \"guess\" about all you need to know or have on campus.",

You might want to ask current students on the r/georgetown thread. Their info will be much fresher and candid! And, some you'll just have to Breathe!\n\nEDIT: Crazy person here didn't realize we were on the GU thread! It's late!",

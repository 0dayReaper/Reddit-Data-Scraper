Crystal City has a bit of a reputation of being kind of dead on the weekends as well or at least it used to.\n\nTo get to the main campus from Crystal City you would need to get to the Metro and take it for a few stops to Rosslyn, then walk a mile or 2 across they key bridge, or catch the georgetown shuttle from Rosslyn.",

It takes 15-20 additional minutes to get from Crystal City to Rosslyn by Metro and then it takes 10-20 minutes to get to campus by the free GUTS shuttle or around 30 minutes by walking from Rosslyn. So Crystal City is double the commute compared to Rosslyn and the prices are fairly similar. North of campus tends to be popular as well, especially Burleith/Glover Park.",

Forget driving - there is no parking.  Walking across Key Bridge in the winter sucks donkey balls.  \n\nI can't speak to the area in terms of livability (pentagon city was not bad), CC has changed a lot (probably for the better), but the commute is going to make you miserable.   As other people have pointed out, Rosslyn or north of campus would be better.",

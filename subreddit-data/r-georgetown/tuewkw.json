    "postText": "Hello!\n\nA couple of days ago I got an offer for SFS at Georgetown and I'm really excited! I'm looking to major in International Political Economy.\n\nI've read and heard that there are abundant internship opportunities for SFS students in different fields, but I'm really interested in exploring internships at the governmental/public level in places like The World Bank / IMF / State Dept down the line since my rather ambitious goal atm is to work in the UN (don't shit on me lol it might change down the line).\n\nThe thing is, I'm an international student with an Indian passport. Would this be a disadvantage in terms of  internship opportunities in the areas I mentioned before?\n\nWould really appreciate your guys' inputs :)",

Even if it\u2019s technically allowed for you to apply, which it may not be, the security clearance would be very difficult.",

            "comment": "As an international student, presumably on an F1 visa, it's normally against visa conditions to work or intern off-campus for the first full school year. There's some special permission thing that you can get in some cases, but afaik it's pretty difficult to get. After that, you should be able to work and intern with these for the rest of your Georgetown time.",

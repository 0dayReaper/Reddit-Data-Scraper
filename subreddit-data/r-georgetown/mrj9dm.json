Our gradual return is beginning this summer, with a full return of our community for the fall.\n\nI write today to share an important update on vaccines, which will play a significant role in enabling our return. Following the guidance of our Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Ranit Mishori, and our Public Health Advisory group, and in consultation with student, staff, and faculty leaders, we will require undergraduate and graduate students at the Main Campus, Medical Center, and Law Center to receive a COVID-19 vaccination for the fall semester.\n\nMore than 75 million people in the United States have been vaccinated, and beginning on Monday, April 19, vaccines will be available to all adults in the U.S. Vaccination rates have already begun to have an impact in decreasing the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.\n\nFor international students and students living abroad, we will be providing additional information in the coming weeks\u2014recognizing that there are different vaccines and differing levels of access to vaccines for those living outside the United States.\n\nOur COVID-19 [Vaccines web page](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v2/9bvWB6DVDaFq/V3E1NkFyMFNVa05pVzNjenBzaERFZTBoSExmZGFicWtIVmYvUVRBV3lDQUpvUDFUVGhnWjBjdU5GZWNKQ2pGY0hDRzBiUEo1ckwzckg4dEhVSGhYK253dmtySG5nTHFmWlFvaEJjNXdlVXM9S0/UnF5d00vRmc0NWdyd3NCZDBGbTZOVmthN2hNaDVON2FtUUtZWG1MSnlNV1JweG1tZG9xd1B0eGVTVHRzNDg1OAS2) and [FAQs](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v2/x4pjcR0708B~/V3E1NkFyMFNVa05pVzNjenBzaERFZTBoSExmZGFicWtIVmYvUVRBV3lDQUpvUDFUVGhnWjBjdU5GZWNKQ2pGY0hDRzBiUEo1ckwzckg4dEhVSGhYK253dmtySG5nTHFmWlFvaEJjNXdlVXM9S0/UnF5d00vRmc0NWdyd3NCZDBGbTZOVmthN2hNaDVON2FtUUtZWG1MSnlNV1JweG1tZG9xd1B0eGVTVHRzNDg1OAS2) provide some additional details on our approach. We will provide updated information on issues such as timing, verification process, and exemptions, once it becomes available. As with all of our existing vaccination requirements for students, medical and religious exemptions will be granted in accordance with federal and local law.\n\nAs we look at the additional public health measures that will enable our safe return this fall, we are closely reviewing whether we will establish a vaccine requirement for faculty and staff. We are consulting with our faculty and staff leadership bodies as we consider this decision.\n\nThank you for your continuing efforts to protect the health and safety of our community. We will share additional updates in the coming weeks.\n\nYou have my very best wishes.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn J. DeGioia",

That being said, and I am extremely pro-vax, finished up last week, I do think they may not be able to \"require\" people to get vaccinated due mainly to the EUA designation. Also you will still have folks claiming religious exemption. It was the right decision because it provides the uni's firm stance, but I foresee implementation being another question for the fringe people.",

            "comment": "I know this is an old post but I figured I\u2019d comment on it anyways (I\u2019m bored on a long bus ride lmao).\n\nParty: I\u2019d say it\u2019s a lot less of a party school than a typical state school, but we do have fun. Social life is really what you make of it. Some people party 3x/week+, others don\u2019t. Some people go to all the basketball games, others don\u2019t. Between DC, the basketball games, and campus parties, there\u2019s plenty to do. Also- Because Georgetown doesn\u2019t recognize Greek life, Party/social life revolves around the clubs you choose to join. There are frats if that\u2019s your thing, but they don\u2019t dominate the social scene. Most of them aren\u2019t officially recognized by the school (except for the community service/religious frats). \n\nHooking up: I\u2019d say the hookup/dating scene isn\u2019t as prevalent as in other schools. Being that Georgetown is catholic, some of the students (more-so the girls) are averse to one night stands. But there are also plenty of people that do hook up a lot, so it\u2019s all up to you. People won\u2019t judge you for whatever you end up choosing, as long as you don\u2019t hurt anyone in the process. \n\nDating: people date. With the caveat that a lot of people are very school/career focused, so they sometimes prioritize that ahead of dating. Dating apps are common, and people do sometimes date people from other schools (GW, American, Catholic U).",

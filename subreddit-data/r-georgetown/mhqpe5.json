    "postText": "Hey everyone! I just got accepted last week and am going to attend (just waiting on my financial aid offer). \n\nI know you can dual major but what exactly does that look like? Can you dual major between different colleges or does it have to be in the same college? What does it look like on your degree? Do you get two separate degrees or just two majors listed on one degree? \n\nAnd do you declare that you want to dual major at the end of sophomore year (I\u2019m accepted into the college for government so that\u2019s when I would declare my first major if I understand things correctly). \n\nSo I think a dual major like government and history would be possible right? But would a dual major of government and something in the sfs still be possible or would it just be a certificate? \n\nThanks! :)",

I was able to add a second major within the college just by emailing my advisor and someone at the department and telling them I\u2019ve taken X number of classes and will take Y more before I graduate to meet the requirement.\n\nTo add a minor I just looked at the requirements halfway thru my senior year and realized I was going to meet them, emailed my advisor and they added the minor, totally painless.",

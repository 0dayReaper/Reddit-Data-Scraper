    "postText": "I am an incoming transfer to Georgetown and I fly back home from Newark/JFK usually. I typically have a lot of luggage on me, and just wanted to check if there\u2019s any bus (or train) service from Georgetown or DC to either of the NY airports. I tried searching online and it seems like there are some services available for Newark, but not for JFK. Could someone advise?",

    "postText": "Hi, both my partner and I make sufficient income that would make my son not eligible to get any loans from FAFSA. However, due to a number of reasons, I.e.:  we have 3 other children and elderly parents who we are taking care of, we would like him to foot at least a portion of the tuition. \n\nDoes anyone of any strategies we should employ to qualify for FAFSA?",

My parents made too much for me to qualify for anything but still barely enough to afford a car payment and mortgage. I had to get a full ride in order to even be able to afford college....

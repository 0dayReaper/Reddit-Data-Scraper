            "comment": "ngl, its just a milking scheme to get your money. They canceled all study abroad programs for spring and summer and even for senior graduation pretty much yet they want this \"freshman sumemr program\" to happen this summer. If you really think about it, georgetown is just capitalizing on the fact that most freshmen have not been on campus so they are throwing out this freshman summer program. Its basically just paying tens of thousands to walk around campus, get some decent instagram pics, do some awkward icebreakers, eat some mediocre dining hall food for the summer. Too sus in my opinion and yeah I agree with everyone else, its much livelier in the fall anyways and you will save tens of thousands. But of course, if you or your parents have the money to spare, you don't have anything better to do this summer, or you want to take some summer classes to free up your schedule then go for it.",

There will be hundreds of other newly-on-campus sophomores just like you. You'll also be able to join lots of clubs/organizations to get to know people",

Plus, going there and then packing up and coming back entails a lot of logistics. It was tough to decide to hold our breath for just a bit longer, but soon she will be on campus and we can collectively exhale.",

You can learn the fundamentals at gtown but there isnt good classes for learning modern technologies like cloud stuff, different kinds of databases, etc. if youre interested in tech policy or civic tech, gtown can be good but if what you are trying to get is a SWE job in big tech, i would go to a state school with a dope cs program. Its not impossible to do it, but its not the optimal route",

Some professors don\u2019t teach anything at all and assign homework assignments that are practically undoable even if you attend and listen to all their lectures. The selection of classes is rather limited. Of course, coding is something in which regardless of school you\u2019ll have to put in your own time to learn, but if you want to do anything stem, I\u2019d say Georgetown is not a good fit. Additionally Georgetown has a stupid rule that you\u2019re not allowed to take more than one class of computer science per semester until your 4th semester there.",

Not every professor is great and you can\u2019t avoid some because the program small and they teach required classes, but some of the profs are really good and because the program is so small you get to know them well and can take their electives, do research with them, TA their classes, etc which is an experience you may not get in a bigger program with more clout. If you are engaged and put in the work you\u2019ll get a fine technical education and the ability to apply it on modern technologies even if you aren\u2019t exposed to them directly in your coursework. \n\nA lot of grads go into government or public sector consulting jobs which are mainly what recruit on campus. I ended up at Amazon just by applying and doing well on the interviews. Now I am at a smaller company and and the other parts of my required Gtown education (mainly being an effective writer) have helped me excel in both Staff levels and management jobs that are highly cross functional and collaborative.",

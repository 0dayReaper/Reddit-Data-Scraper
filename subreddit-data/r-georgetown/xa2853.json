I was curious about the prerequisite courses for the government major in the Georgetown college are they like anthropology , a foreign language , lab science and etc. Also curious about the main core classes where they like ( intro to American gov, international politics, &amp; comparative govt, &amp; etc). Also curious as to how was your experience personally if you don\u2019t mind me asking.",

You have 4 core classes all gov students have to take: US Political Systems, Comparative Political Systems, International Relations, and Elements of Political Theory (personally my least favorite out of the 4 lol). Some students can get out of USPS with a good AP US Gov score, and as a transfer you might get credit if you\u2019ve taken a college course in US Government, but I can\u2019t speak to those myself. \n\nBeyond that, you have all the leeway you want to decide the rest of your 6+ electives for your degree. You can take any Government class or Government cross-list (courses in other departments like Int\u2019l Affairs, Int\u2019l Economy, Sociology, Jewish Studies, etc. that have been preapproved to count as Government electives) you want on any topic. The only requirements are:\n1) One course must be marked as a Political Theory elective.\n2) One course must be a Department Seminar, a small-group, writing intensive course that is also specially marked.\n\nThose two requirements can be filled with one class if you find a DepSem that is also marked as Political Theory. Overall, it\u2019s 10 courses minimum; a lot of students end up taking more depending upon their interest, though I didn\u2019t.",

They can be hard to get into since they\u2019re so small, but there are a lot of them so my advice would be to find one that seems like a subject you\u2019d enjoy, because that\u2019s what you\u2019re eventually gonna be writing about. You\u2019ll probably have some latitude to choose the topic, but within the constraints of the class.",

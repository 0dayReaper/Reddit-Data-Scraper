Call your mother for some of the best bagels around. Levain Bakery for the best cookies. If you\u2019re feeling fancy, The Sovereign has great Belgian food, and I hear Martins Tavern has great food as well. I don\u2019t highly recommend T-Sweet(overly sweetened to the point where it hurts your stomach), but if you\u2019re hankering for ice cream go for it. Hope this helped!",

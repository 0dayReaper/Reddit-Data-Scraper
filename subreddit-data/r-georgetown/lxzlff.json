I\u2019m not thrilled about it being in the middle of the summer, because we\u2019ll have to leave campus for this weird, liminal space of time before the fall semester actually starts. I would also feel guilty spending extra tuition money to take credits that I don\u2019t technically need to graduate. I appreciate the gesture tho",

I was recently accepted for fall 2023 transfer and was wondering if any transfers could share about their experience/insights specifically as a transfer student. \n\nAlso more indecisive about this than I thought I\u2019d be\u2014how did you make the decision to transfer and was it ultimately worth it? Specifically about your thought process etc (feel free to PM if you want to not comment publicly)",

The only negative thing I\u2019ve heard from transfers is pre-med/health people not having enough time in 3 years to complete requirements for a specific path? I\u2019m in the humanities so I\u2019m not really sure haha but I feel like the large majority of transfers are to the SFS and they seem to like it! Hoya saxa and good luck",

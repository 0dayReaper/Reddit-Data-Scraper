    "postText": "Hello! I am hoping to overload for the next semester, but there seems to be pretty strict policy about overloading in georgetown\n\nAccording to the undergraduate bulletin:\n\n&gt;Ordinarily, students are limited to a maximum of five courses of three credits or more per semester. The five-course limit safeguards time required for study, encourages intellectual seriousness and depth, and protects student wellness. Students wishing to take a sixth course (of three credits or more) must petition their advising dean to do so; they should have a sound academic reason for requesting the overload and a demonstrated record of success in previous full-time semesters. \n\nDoes anyone here have experience requesting for overloading? Would greatly appreciate any sharing! Thank you :)",

That being said, I'm doing an intensive language, so that (and insane pre-med lab requirements) make the approval process much easier. They should approve you if you communicate with your dean beforehand and demonstrate that you can successfully handle it. \n\nIt seems strict, but it's really not. Don't worry about it.",

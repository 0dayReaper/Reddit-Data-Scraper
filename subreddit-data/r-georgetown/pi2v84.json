However, it sort of feels like I\u2019m late to the party, so to speak. People already mostly know each other and I\u2019m still doing intros. I\u2019m expecting the beginning of clubs to narrow that gap, but I just wanted to know if anyone else is feeling the same.",

            "comment": "As a senior who felt like this a lot during my first year, here is my advice to you guys:\n\n1. To the sophomores who were not here last year or over the summer, it might be better to look at yourselves as freshman (in a social way).  You have literally been here for 1.5 weeks! You cannot compare yourself to people who were in the DC area last year, or even those who were at SHIP over the summer.  That's just unrealistic and setting yourself up for failure.  \n2. Friendship is not a race or a competition.  Some people are perfectly content with a few friends, while others have so many friends and still feel depressed and lonely.  Some people have an easier time adjusting to college than others (especially boarding school kids who have lived on their own previously), and that's perfectly normal!  \n3. In my experience, a lot of the 'friend groups' that I saw early on in freshman year are not still close now as seniors.  While I have had a lot of great friends, the degree at which I hang out with certain people fluctuates by the semester, and even by the year.  You never know who you will get close with.  There are some guys I saw a lot in my first semester who I don't even talk to now.  On the other hand, some guys I talk to a lot now I didn't even know my first semester.\n4. Spend less time in your room! Many things (eating, studying, just 'chilling out') can be done in communal spaces which can facilitate more social interaction. It's strange to say this, but some of my closest friends here have came from watching football games in HFSC or studying with friends in Lau 2. One of my friend groups freshman year formed because I and these other guys kept seeing each other in the HFSC TV room during Thursday night football games.  \n5. Talk to people.  It disturbs me how much people are glued to their phones.  That person in line at Leo's with you- say hi! That kid sitting next to you in class- say hi! A friend of mine is in a serious relationship that started from a \"nice cat\" zoom DM.  lmao\n6. Join social clubs.  While many clubs here are cut throat and pre professional, so many clubs on campus are designed to help students meet each other.  Religious clubs, the grilling society, the Voice, many of the music groups, frisbee, dance, etc... are some  clubs that I have heard people having fun and meeting friends in.  Try new things because honestly you never know where it will take you.  \n7. You will be fine!!! Yo u're not alone.  Everyone is feeling like this.  \n\nI know this is a lot to take in, but I really do feel for you guys! \n\nHoya Saxa!",

And yeah, I agree with everything you\u2019ve said; I\u2019ve been doing everything you said and I\u2019ll admit it helps a lot. I guess the most important thing is that concept of being a social freshman. Sophomores are kinda in a weird spot if they didn\u2019t do ship; they feel like freshman but interact with other sophomores who seem like seniors. If you view yourself as a social freshman at first, it helps make that gap seem less unnatural and easier to cross!",

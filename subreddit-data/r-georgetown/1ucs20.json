Buildings like this are so beautiful and historic, but look to the right of it and you have these cheap brick looking buildings that just look like they were made to be made. Places like UofR have really stuck with one design for all of campus and it gets it's rewards for it... Why hasn't Georgetown done this? Everyone told me how pretty it is up there, and it is, but only a few buildings. Maybe in context to being in a dc city it brings some beauty?",

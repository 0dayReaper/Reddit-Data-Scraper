    "postText": "Hi everyone. New to this sub. I\u2019m pursuing my undergraduate right now and should be done in a year or two. I\u2019m wanting to pursue a career in real estate and noticed Georgetown offers a masters program in real estate. Has anyone on this sub gone through the program? How did you like it? Do you feel like it helped you land a job related to real estate? What job were you able to land because of the program? Was the cost manageable? Would love to hear feedback.",

For our MBAs, great placement in DC and the program does provide unique connections to firms that prioritize Georgetown grads over others. Contact Matt Cypher if interested in more information",

My friend had a party shut down last halloween by some Georgetown faculty people who were patrolling the neighborhood for Georgetown students who were throwing parties. That was somewhere north of Georgetown (between GU and Glover Park). Apparently they spewed some BS about not allowing parties because as a Georgetown student you represent Georgetown or something. I think she also had some disciplinary action too. Mind you none of the party was too rowdy or overly loud, but they mentioned something about the front door being open. Anyway I don\u2019t remember much because I was drunk but you might wanna look out for that kind of crap.",

            "comment": "Georgetown has a neighborhood watch called SNAPS that patrols regularly. Non-official rules are you should try to wrap up large parties by around 12, keep your doors shut, keep people inside, and if you can hear the party from the street pavement then it is too loud. In my experience, West Georgetown (Saxby's, near front gates, etc...) is a lot more lax than Burleith SNAPS.\n\nOfficial rules are below, Georgetown's rules are stricter than DC laws, which state you can't have excessive noise between 10 pm and 7 am.\n\n[https://neighborhood.georgetown.edu/georgetown-students/living-in-your-home/](https://neighborhood.georgetown.edu/georgetown-students/living-in-your-home/)",

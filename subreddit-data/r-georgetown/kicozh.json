    "postText": "Georgetown has been one of my top schools since tenth grade. I want to go into politics and love DC, so it seems like a perfect choice for me. But I think I might be being idealistic. I really want to have a fun college experience- I want to be able to party, and take part in greek life too. I would be applying regular (Applied to UPenn ED, got rejected) but I'm starting to wonder if it's even worth it. \n\nAre teachers understanding/willing to work with students? Are the dorms and food really that bad? Do people go to sports games? Is there school spirit? These are all super important to me, but I'm starting to wonder whether I'm going to find them at Georgetown...",

We work hard and play hard and do so in one of the coolest cities in this country",

Have parties and full blown out games right now is irresponsible.",

            "comment": "People really overexaggerate the state of the facilities at Gtown. Yes, there are bad incidents from time to time, but during my time there I've never run into any one of them in my living space. It shouldn't be much of a problem, especially with the new dorm renovations this year. The teachers have been some of the best part about Gtown for me. Sure, you have one or two profs who suck, but what school doesn't? Gtown profs for the most part have been nothing but kind and willing to help. Even though Gtown food may be bad, you have so many (cheap!) options within the area that it doesn't even matter after a year or two. Soooo many people go to sports games, and when we won the Big East soccer championship, it was wild. There was a whole watch party going on in the social floor of our library. There are frats that, while unofficial, provide everything a regular greek life experience at another school would. If the social aspect is what you're worried about--like at any school, it's what you make of it. Don't let those fears hold you back from what is one of the top schools to study politics in. (And experience DC as a whole, because man did I fall in love with DC during my time here.) Happy to answer any other questions you have.",

There are also two bus stops on campus if you wanna learn the bus system. Or you can Uber, scooter, bike (there\u2019s two capital bike share stations), etc",

Most people don\u2019t leave the Georgetown neighborhood too often and when you do you can walk to the mall in like 45 minutes if you\u2019d rather not Uber. If you really need to use the metro you just walk like 20 minutes to the metro in Rosslyn. Def a super silly reason to choose GW over GU IMO (considering GU is ranked #23 and GW is #66)",

I would even say that as long as you resist the temptation to apply to the hyper competitive clubs that have apps (GUAFSCU, IRC, Hoya, etc) in the beginning, it's really easy to avoid that mindset. Joining those clubs can really get you entrenched in the hyper competitive atmosphere. The best thing you can do is make yourself some upperclassmen friends (by joining more social, less pre professional clubs like the school frats) who have a good head on their shoulders and will give you a different perspective.",

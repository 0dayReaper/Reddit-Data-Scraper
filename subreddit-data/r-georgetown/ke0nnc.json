I was wondering what the atmosphere is like surrounding them from current members.\n\nI'm a senior applying this year and I've seen conflicting info so I came here for clarification",

I highly recommend if we\u2019re back in person next year, got to know some really great people by doing it. Jawani and Zaarish are actual dance teams (follow them on ig for more info) so if you have the time/skill to do that then go for it",

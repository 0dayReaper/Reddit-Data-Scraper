    "postText": "Hello Hoyas!\n\nI am an incoming master's student at GU and am super excited about becoming a part of the GU community. I've never been to DC before and can't visit the school before I start, so I was hoping to get some inputs on vegetarian food options in and around the Hilltop and the rest of DC proper. What are some of your go-to places with good vegetarian options? I want to explore all kinds of food and especially enjoy Mexican and Indian food!\n\n\nTIA!",

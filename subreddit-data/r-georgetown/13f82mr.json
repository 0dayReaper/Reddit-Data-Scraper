    "postText": "Hi all!! I was accepted to both Barnard and Gtown as a transfer and am currently split btw the two. For reference I grew up in NYC and currently attend college in DC so I am familiar with both cities. I\u2019m wary of Gtown\u2019s \u201cboarding school-esque\u201d school culture and lack of diversity. I grew up in a preppy bubble which was very elitist and I don\u2019t want to hop right back in one. I am excited about SFS but not 100% sure I want to go down the foreign policy route (why I wanted to potentially double major in Govt but I can\u2019t do that across colleges). One of my core reasons for transferring was to study South Asian Studies. Columbia\u2019s program is fantastic whereas Georgetown\u2019s certificate was just introduced this year and has limited Hindi proficiency. I know the opportunities of studying politics in DC are endless but NYC has plenty of them as well. \n\nI attended all-girls school in HS (and loved it) but I still feel slightly apprehensive about 3 years in a historically women\u2019s college. Growing up in NYC too I worry Barnard\u2019s too familiar for me. I really do believe that you can never get tired of NYC but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s enough of a shift I need for college. I also don\u2019t know if Barnard/Columbia has that much school spirit and \u201cra-ra\u201d(for lack of better word) compared to Gtown. Also Barnard transfer housing isn\u2019t guaranteed.\n \nWould love any insight!! I feel like I could see myself thriving in both environments and I am torn.",

            "comment": "I think Georgetown's \"boarding school culture\" and lack of diversity are grossly overstated. It depends a lot on the circles you embed yourself within, and you will certainly be able to find spaces that aren't dominated by rich frat bros. SFS is pretty flexible and a lot of people don't end up going into international affairs per se, but you're correct that South Asia isn't one of their strongest departments (there's some really great professors, so I'm really just speaking in a relative sense.)",

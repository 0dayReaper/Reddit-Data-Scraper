    "postText": " I dont know if this is something that shouldn\u2019t be posted here but now im conflicted. Im planning on studying business and I really dont know which one I should go to. For context I already live in new york so i do like the idead of getting away but i feel like columbia my be better in terms of prestige or connections? Idk? The bummy thing about it is right now im at a georgetown event and its really good so far, but i know at these afmitted student events its their job to convince you. And lets face it columbia is an Ivy League school and im trying not to let that impact my decision but passing it up is unsettling. I dont have any programming for columbia scheduled do you guys have any suggestions on how to make the decision. Should i even worry about prestige. Im currently at the hoya saxa weekend and i like it so far is this consistent with how it will actually be on campus.  How did you guys make your decisions? Anything helps",

            "comment": "Both Columbia and gtown business schools have incredible job placement and both schools will give you a great education. Columbia is obviously a little more prestigious, but not that much more. If I were you, id go where you think you\u2019d be the best fit and where you\u2019d enjoy college more. For my two cents, Georgetown neighborhood &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; west Harlem",

            "comment": "Columbia is def more prestigious. But that really doesn\u2019t matter. The reality is that in life your success is more individually driven than anything else.\n\nIf you want IB/MBB/PE whatever, ur gonna have no problem getting looks for those opps at gtown.\n\nIf you like gtown more come here. I think the main thing to consider though is how sure you are of what u want to do. If its just pre preprofessional, ur set here. If you don\u2019t know fs, columbia def has a way broader range of academic strengths which is rly nice to have. Also in general the interests/areas of study of gtown students are way more homogenized than at columbia. If u want to be in a community where ppl have more diverse interests and talents, columbia will better cater to that. And maybe in general the bar of columbia students will be ever so slightly higher but yeah whatever - top gtown students r weapons dude. Ur good either way",

I went to the Georgetown neighborhood and really liked the cuteness and change of pace. I also went to the event and now am committed. I thought the event they put on was really nice and the people were all cool.",

Just go to the school you like the most, because they are both different in terms of student experience and culture. \n\nThey are both great schools in big cities, but other than that there's a lot that's different:\n\nGeorgetown- DC location, Catholic/Jesuit school, D1 sports (notable basketball team), 'club culture'\n\nColumbia (I don't know too much about Columbia)- NYC location, ivy league, definitely more academic than Georgetown",

Ended up picking gtown for the SFS program, but I'm currently in grad school at columbia, and I could not be happier to have picked georgetown for undergrad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it's really up to your personal preferences (the type of people attracted to each school, campus culture, and school campuses/vibe are extremely different), but if you feel called more to georgetown over columbia, then I wouldn't worry at all about passing up an ivy, prestige, etc. They're both great schools. Do well in school and you'll have the same job and grad school options from both. It really just comes down to where you feel like you fit best.",

Most people pick up either finance, math, or econ if they are looking to go into that field. Everyone (who is on top of their shit and tries) gets good business/finance/consulting/whatever internships at Columbia. Hope that helps",

    "postText": "hi all! i got accepted as a transfer student for fall 2023 in the school of foreign service, and i am super super excited, but i\u2019m debating not going because of the cost. i\u2019m the oldest of four kids in a middle class family, and as appreciative as i am of the privileges that has afforded me, georgetown gave me no aid whatsoever (which i\u2019m confused about because my state school gave me aid), and my family can\u2019t afford to pay for three years at georgetown and then and additional 12 years at whatever schools my siblings choose in the future. \n\nso, for those who were in a similar situation to me, how did you afford georgetown? is it mostly just about filling out as many scholarship applications as possible? is the debt worth the education? how much would the debt affect my future? is it even worth trying?",

Mention any scholarships you have at other schools and ask them to match them. Make sure you show that you really want to attend and will do so if they can match your other aid/scholarships. I got offered $0 and was able to negotiate $60k just by sending a couple emails.",

Being a transfer probably exacerbates this, as financial aid for transfers tends to be limited compared to that for first years.",

    "postText": "I'm interested in applying for the MSN program specializing in AGACNP. I'm very much not a traditional student and wondering if it will hurt my chances at all? Bachelors &amp; Masters in other areas (MPS from GU's SCS), went back to school for nursing (ASN program) in my mid-30s, currently working on a BSN while working as an ICU nurse and also part-time staff tutor at my ASN alma mater. \n\nCan anyone out in reddit land offer any guidance? How competitive are the NP programs? Any suggestions on how to boost my chances for getting in?",

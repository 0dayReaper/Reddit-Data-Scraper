It's kind of far \u2014 take the shuttle to dupont and walk about 5 minutes \u2014 but it's quiet, long hours, has indoor seating, relatively cheap (~$3-4), and doesn't have a no-laptop policy. Pretty quiet during the weekdays. Wifi is fast but sometimes cuts out during long videos/recordings, though. There's East West Coffee in Clarendon too (take the 38B) but that's really far. \n\nMost cafes in the district are still takeout only unfortunately, and the few that *are* open (tryst, kramer's, open city i think etc.) seem to be outdoor dining only (and thus noisy) or fail one of the things above. Other suggestions appreciated",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a first year in the MSB and I\u2019m interested in minoring in two subjects. My major is unclear atm (either Business and Global Affairs or one/two majors) but I\u2019m curious if it\u2019s realistic to double minor. The minors (language and liberal arts) both require 6-7 three credit courses.\n\nAt the same time, is it possible to both double minor and double major? With the exception of this year, I rather not take summer courses. I\u2019ve also already taken 2 courses for the language minor and plan to take 2 courses for the liberal arts in summer and in fall.\n\nWould love to hear from upper years who have double minored/majored. Thank you!",

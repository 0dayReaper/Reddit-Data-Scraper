I am posting here because I live across the key bridge in Rosslyn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in search of a tutor / babysitter for my 2.5 year old. I have not been sending him to daycare but want him to progress in his milestones. We are thinking of a M-F 8 AM - 12 PM type schedule, but are very flexible. Somewhere in the range of $20/hour.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Super professional and qualified tutors, most are current/retired teachers so they know what they are doing plus they send you updates of what they cover each day so that you can keep track and supplement what they\u2019re teaching. I think they do have a waitlist so message me if you want a referral!",

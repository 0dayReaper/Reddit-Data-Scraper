    "postText": "As we embark on this exciting journey together, it would be great to have a platform where we can share information, discuss any concerns, and foster a sense of camaraderie even before we meet in person. This group could be a place to discuss practical matters like move-in arrangements, class schedules, and university-related updates. Additionally, we can use it to get to know each other better, share our interests, and plan activities or outings. It will also be a valuable resource for any questions or challenges we may encounter throughout the year.\n\nI invite all of you to join me in creating this WhatsApp group. Please share your details with me (in the google form), and I will take the initiative to set up the group and add everyone.\n\nI look forward to connecting with each of you and creating a supportive and enjoyable living environment. Together, we can make our time at Georgetown University a memorable and rewarding experience.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwS3Vn4oOLjNc55HcEwMN5uPtTbAM\\_JRN8qUgwbjx1cyLooA/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwS3Vn4oOLjNc55HcEwMN5uPtTbAM_JRN8qUgwbjx1cyLooA/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

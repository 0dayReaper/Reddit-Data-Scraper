    "postText": "Hi,\n\nMy sister is going to be touring Georgetown this week. We're spending the weekend there and I would love to take her to a local student lunch spot near campus for lunch. What are some good restaurants that are popular amongst students here? She loves sushi, Pho / Vietnamese, Thai cuisine, but I just want to take her to a popular spot so she can get a real feel of what living there is like. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hey there!\n\nWent to Gtown, lived in DC/NOVA for years afterward. Here's a bunch of places I'd recommend:\n\n**Right Off-Campus:**\n\nThe Tombs: **The** Georgetown Bar. If your sister ends up at Georgetown, she will definitely go here often - both for lunches with professors and for partying with friends (after she's 21). Standard American-fare food, but everything is sourced really well and the food is a great bang for your buck.\n\nWisey's (Wisemillers): Just as Tombs is **the** bar, Wisey's is **the** sandwich shop. A hole in the wall for sandwiches, quick eats, and some small groceries, it is a Gtown institution. I am partial to the Hot Chick w/ Avocado, but many people like the Burger/Chicken Madnesses.\n\nJetties: On the other side of campus there's a Jetties. I personally was never a big fan, but a bunch of people swear by it. I'd say it's like, a slightly nicer Wisey's alternative.\n\n**M Street:**\n\nPizza Paradiso: Popular spot for slightly nicer pizza and drinks just on M St., the main commercial corridor of the area. There will be lots of options if you walk down either M St. or Wisconsin Ave.\n\nFilomena: Expensive, but some of the best Italian food you will ever have. Filomena is also an institution, often booked for graduations, anniversaries, or other fancier events.\n\nChaia: A great place to pop into if you're into eco-friendly/vegetarian food. They make tacos that are completely veggie friendly, and actually taste good too!\n\nKintaro: A decent sushi place just off M St. Fair prices, okay selection, decent service. I went to better places in VA, but options around campus are a tad limited.\n\nDas Ethiopian: If you've never had Ethiopian food, now is the time to try! Das is great, and the experience itself is worth it. Highly recommend stopping in.\n\nFarmers Fishers Bakers (Waterfront): Became very popular a few years back, and now has a bunch of off-shoots around the city. Definitely not bad, but definitely overpriced considering you can get American-fare just as good as Clyde's of Georgetown.\n\n**Wisconsin Ave:**\n\nThe Sovereign: Decent, American-style food with a huge selection of beer.\n\nEl Centro: The go-to Mexican-style restaurant for students. Also big for margaritas, and at night it turns into a dance floor bumping latin vibes.\n\nMai Thai: As mentioned already, Mai Thai is a popular restaurant for students on birthdays, or big get-togethers. I always found it a bit overpriced for what it was, not to say that it's bad just a tad expensive.\n\nPeacock Cafe: Another alternative for nicer celebratory events like birthdays or get-togethers.\n\nLos Cuates: The cheaper, but still go-to student Mexican restaurant. Had a reputation for serving underage during my time, so it was big to go for pitchers of sangria.\n\nJaco: A taco and juice bar. If that sounds weird, you're not wrong. But the food is good, albeit a bit overpriced.\n\nSimply Banh Mi: Great Banh Mi and alternatives, and not too far from campus (don't be intimidated, walking this far up Wisconsin is super normal for students).\n\nPho Asian Bistro: Not the best Pho you've ever had, but not bad honestly. If you're looking for Pho it's probably the best in a close radius.\n\nWingos: Had a fire and had to move way up Wisconsin. That said, prior to the move it was an institution for Georgetown students. They used to do half off on Wednesdays and it's no exaggeration to say the entire campus would pick up dinner from them Wednesday night.\n\n**Further Away but an Easy Drive:**\n\nThe Hamilton (DC): The largest restaurant in DC. It has American fare, a sushi bar, multiple full service bars, and an entire concert venue inside. It's a cool place and worth a trip if you have time.\n\nPho75 (VA): Easily the best Pho in the area can be found in Northern Virginia. It's an easy enough trip through the metro as long as you don't mind walking over to Rosslyn. But if you have a car, **definitely** drive over.\n\nSushi Rock (VA): Definitely my favorite sushi place in the region. They have live bands often, and a selection of Asian inspired cocktails.\n\nThai Select (VA): A decent Thai place that also has some Japanese cuisine. Again, you'll find better 'asian' food in NoVA if you have access to a car or are willing to take the metro.\n\nTacos El Chilango (VA): A taco truck that's super tucked away but also really easy to find on Maps. Look for the \"14th St. Location\" on Google Maps, it's literally just a food truck that never moves. Easily the best tacos in the region, hands down. The guys who run the truck are super nice too. Cash only!\n\nIron Age (MD): I think they opened one in DC, but I always went to the original in MD. You will 100% want a car for this (it is metro-accessible, just far). Best Korean BBQ in the region IMO. And it had the best pricing structure, as it was cheaper and a better spread than most other places.\n\n\nHope this was helpful! I tried to make sure to include Sushi/Thai/Pho places, but your options will be a tad limited - and there's some really great places to try that serve American or Mexican. Out of the whole list, you should 100% go to Wisey's and/or the Tombs at least once, since they are student staples for undergraduates. Enjoy your trip, and good luck to your sister!!",

            "comment": "The best Thai/sushi place near campus is Mai Thai on Prospect Street. It\u2019s kinda pricy so it\u2019s usually reserved for special occasions and parents visiting (at least for me). Booeymonger is a sandwich place next door that some students are into. On campus you can try Epi (the epicurean). It\u2019s a restaurant attached to Darnell and across from medstar. Students, staff, and healthcare workers all eat there. \n\nI hope you have a good visit!",

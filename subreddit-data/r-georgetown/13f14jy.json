    "postText": " Hi, I'm a sophomore transfer who just got into Georgetown and got a question about the BA minor. I see on the website that the BA minor is open for students at the spring semester of sophomore year. Is it only open to MSB students? If so, how competitive is the app?\n\nThanks so much for your replies!!!",

If you are thinking of applying, taking an econ course (micro or macro) as well as a stats course is required to apply (meaning you have to complete these by the end of the fall of your sophomore year). it is fairly competitive since the minor is capped at 50 students per class. to improve your application, the more quant-focused classes you can take the better and focus on getting strong grades in these ofc. also spend some time thinking about the written prompt for the application. best of luck!",

It might be easier than getting into the minor and would give you much greater exposure to fundamental business concepts than the minor will.",

Yes, MSB is always my dream place and I am planning on an internal transfer but heard my friend in Georgetown saying it's almost impossible for transfer applicants to get in another school through internal transfer again (Otherwise, the AO would wonder why didn't u just directly apply to their school when you were transferring from an external school). For that reason I'm planning to possess a BA minor and Econ major trying to make myself looks more \"relevant\" when pursuing a career after graduate.",

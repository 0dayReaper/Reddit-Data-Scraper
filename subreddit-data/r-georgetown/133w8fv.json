    "postText": "Hi friends. I\u2019m planning on moving in a few months from SF to Washington DC to attend GULC and am really struggling to figure out where to live! \n\nIn SF, I live in Pac Heights and love that it\u2019s a little more low-key and has access to great parks (Lafayette, Alta Plaza, Presidio). I have a dog and am a runner, so access to green space and trails is a huuuge plus for me. I also like proximity to places that have a little more going on\u2026 my current spot is only a few blocks from Polk street, which has my favorite bars, and it\u2019s also super easy to get to Union St and Fillmore St (which are both very much my speed). \n\nAny recommendations for neighborhoods like this in DC? I\u2019m a little older than the average law student: female, 30, single. Needs to be safe enough to run early in the morning solo, have proximity to good trails (ideally with good greenery), and proximity to fun areas with great bars/restaurants/nightlife. My weekly commute will be to Georgetown Law School (so a few blocks from Union Station) and I\u2019d rather not have to drive. \n\nThanks everyone in advance \ud83e\udd70 This move is really stressing me out, haha, so your advice will be so helpful!",

            "comment": "If you want access to green space and safety, northwest DC might be promising. But those neighborhoods also tend to be less \u201chappening\u201d and are located further from the law school. Woodley Park might be a good compromise? You\u2019d be along the Red Line, so the commute wouldn\u2019t be too bad. And you wouldn\u2019t be too far from bars, restaurants, or grocery stores, while also having easier access to the lower portion of Rock Creek Park",

            "comment": "Woodley Park. There are a few apartment buildings to choose from. You literally go straight down the hill into Rock Creek Park to the running and cycling trails (they are all well-populated but not crowded, which I enjoy for safety), the red line metro will take you straight to Union Station, and you're a 10-minute walk from bars at Adams Morgan.\n\nWoodley Park has it's own strip of restaurants that satisfy that quick meal or drink need as well. I'm a grad student at Georgetown now, Female, mid-20s and I moved from another neighborhood of DC to Woodley Park earlier this year for all the reasons you listed. I love it so far and my friends are more than happy to come hang in the area. DM me if you would like more advice on specific buildings or my opinion on some of the other neighborhoods people have mentioned here. I grew up in the DC burbs and have lived in DC since graduating undergrad so I'm familiar with most areas.",

Before starting at GULC, I lived 5 minutes from the Silver Spring stop on the Red Line and really enjoyed that neighborhood.  More crime than Pentagon/Pentagon City, but I stayed alert and was comfortable walking to/from stores, the Metro, and going running even after dark.",

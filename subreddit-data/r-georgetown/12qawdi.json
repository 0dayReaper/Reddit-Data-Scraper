Sorry if this has already been asked but I couldn't find any recent posts (within the past couple years) on it.\n\nAlso if people have thoughts on the culture within SFS for people who aren't interested in consulting and private sphere work. Is it less competitive, and is it hard to resist getting sucked into that stress culture?\n\nThank you!",

Dorms can be bad sometimes, but that\u2019s pretty typical for all universities too - stuff like people pulling fire alarms just because, flooding, ac issues etc. I would say that georgetown seems to be a little worse than average, but I haven\u2019t found that an issue. Personally, I think the food options are great. Leo\u2019s the dining hall can be hit or miss, but there are so many other great options - crop chop (salad place,) epis (American style buffet,) etc, all on the meal plan. Personally, I think the qol is great",

Junior year there was an issue with the fire alarms that lasted several days, and hot water has been finicky in some of the dorms.  None of that severely impacted my qol at the time tho.\n\nThe food options are great imo, the worst part being the limited hours of the food locations on campus.  By 11pm pretty much everything is closed, which wouldn't be an issue if this weren't a college campus tbh.  Only the student grocery store is open later (until 1am).",

If you're generally a happy and optimistic person, Georgetown isn't going to suck the life out of you. Yes, there will be stressful times--it is college at a top 20 school after all--but this is a given. Georgetown gives you all the resources you need to succeed and part of the growing experience in college is learning how to balance different things and prioritize your needs so that you can have a high QoL. It isn't just something that's a given, no matter where you go. You have to work for it.\n\nOn the other hand, I think Georgetown is very conducive to a high QoL. There are so many great features about Gtown and I think the things it gets a bad rep for (dorms, food, competitive environment) are slightly exaggerated and aren't exclusive to Georgetown. \n\nThe school has put millions into renovating the dorms in recent years and they're really not that bad. It won't be the Four Seasons, but many of the dorms are the same/nicer than those I've seen at other schools (especially those for sophomores/juniors--just look at the new Henle).\n\nFood quality can be hit or miss imo, but there's an abundance of options. You can find just about any type of food you're craving somewhere on campus. I personally love the meal plan and how convenient it is.\n\nI'm not in the SFS so can't speak directly on the culture, but I've met so many people who aren't interested in consulting and private sphere work that I'm confident you could find your people. I think it will still be competitive, as that's the nature of the school, but the thing about Georgetown vs. other top schools imo is that the competitive culture is one marked by collaboration instead of tearing others down to push yourself forward. Yes, there's a pressure to perform, but its a place where everyone wants everyone to succeed and achieve great things because they know this is what they are capable of. Very different from some other schools where I've noticed a culture of tearing others apart just to get ahead/make yourself look better. Also, it's very possible to avoid getting sucked into the stress culture. Just remember to focus on yourself and achieving your goals, instead of allowing other peoples' goals to get conflated with your own.\n\nHope this helps.",

For reference, I'm choosing between GU and Pomona (which is known for having a really high quality of life and for having generally happy and relaxed students). This is definitely very reassuring and I like the competitive/collaborative mix you described.",

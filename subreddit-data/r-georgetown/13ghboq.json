I'm a medical student who will be renting out a home right off Georgetown's campus next year (like two blocks away, can send more details + pics privately). $1175/mo for the room, and there will be four tenants total. No cats or dogs allowed, and three are already signed on\u2014one being me.\n\nIf you're interested, please DM me! The landlord's saying I need to move quickly on this. All I need is one last person to sign onto the lease and we're good to go :)",

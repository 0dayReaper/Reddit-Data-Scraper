Seriously, it must be the language equivalent of \u201cRocks for Jocks\u201d.\n\nAnd with streaming today coming with dubs and subtitles, learning French is even easier than piss. Most of the Hollywood blockbusters on Disney+ have VFST options, so you can listen to and read French at the same time.",

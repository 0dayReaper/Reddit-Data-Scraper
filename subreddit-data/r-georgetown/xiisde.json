The classes were fine and I still think I got a good education but I was a lot less impressed than I was by my bio classes and I wouldn't recommend majoring or minoring in chem at Georgetown. \n\nGeorgetown is a large research university with an attached hospital so there's tons of opportunities for research if that's your thing (it wasn't mine). Being located in DC you also have access to a bunch of other hospitals, the NIH, and endless governmental/scientific organizations.",

            "comment": "Bio program at Georgetown is relatively large compared to other college majors (especially STEM), is about 100-110 students per year in a school of about 875 for the college (per class year). That being said, it is probably harder to get into than other majors due to large amounts of premed applications focused on biology and the fact that they don't let you join the major (if applying within Georgetown) until after the first year (mayber 2nd semester, I can't remember).\n\nAs far as the program, its pretty standard, you take you gen bios and chem for the majority of your coursework first year and then sophomore year you can differentiate into one of the subtype majors within bio or stick with general. You end up taking your higher level bios at this point, which are generally lower credit/time intensive. Profs have changed a bit since I went here but generally pretty good department, you have your great, bad, and average. Research is highly encouraged, probably 80% of people engage in research at either medcenter or undergrad campus, the remainder generally TA (not to say you can't do both). Lmk if you have questions.",

            "comment": "Class of 2020 here. \n\nI definitely wouldn\u2019t be bearish about our future. In fact, I\u2019m very bullish. Yes, we are lacking in the hard sciences, but that is only a small/niche group of people. Our premed/natural sciences (bio, human science, etc) programs are very strong and will continue to attract great candidates. Our business/Econ programs will continue to feed into great finance jobs. Our location in DC will always be a pull, and given gen z\u2019s growing interest in politics, will be even more of a factor in the future. As an elite Jesuit school, we will still attract people who are interested in religion/spirituality/theology/philosophy (and I think Georgetown needs to grow this more). And our name is elite. While we are only ranked ~22 or whatever, our name has a lot of history/status behind it. Try to count how many US presidents have came to campus and how many elite speakers we get (we literally had pence and Hillary Clinton in the same semester)!\n\nAlso, think about this- our basketball team was literally 0-20, we were just online/masked for 1.5+ years, and our facilities are/were absolute trash. Despite this, we literally got the most applicants we\u2019ve ever gotten! Once Ewing is fired and we get a real coach and our team does ~decent, that will add another aspect to this school. \n\nGeorgetown is a great place!",

                    "comment": "As to the most applicants we ever gotten, most top 30 schools got the most applicants ever due to an abnormally large number of high school students taking a gap year during COVID to start later, and students transferring for a post-COVID experience. That is a short term post COVID bump, and I wouldn\u2019t exactly call it a indicator of success.",

I had the choice to go to UCSB as an environmental biology major (one of the absolute best schools in the country for that subject) or Georgetown, where I'm one of about a dozen (?) EBIO majors in my year. I ended up going to Georgetown for the name recognition, but it's definitely nowhere near the quality of STEM education I could get elsewhere. Georgetown urgently needs to invest in expanding its STEM horizons.",

            "comment": "Georgetown definitely has a reputation for social science but I think the bio department is really underrated! I'm a bio major on a pre-med track and love my classes and the experience! There is plenty of support available and most professors are extremely understanding and accommodating. Just as a warning though, the pre-med course load is a lot of work and, on top of Georgetown requirements, there isn't as much flexibility in my schedule as I would have liked. Still, I'm planning on studying abroad and pursuing a phil minor. Also, if you are not pre med your schedule and requirements will be different from mine and you should have more space.\n\nGeorgetown also has a lot of biology faculty doing research who are always looking for students. I found that a lot of people are afraid to ask or reach out, but my advice is to just email as many professors as possible! I'm a freshman and am currently working in a research lab under a Graduate school professor. I have a summer research lined up under said professor and am working on my own project towards a possible publication! The size of the student body interested in biology research is less than other larger research universities and so I have found that there are a lot of opportunities available to those who look for them.\n\nCongrats on you acceptance! Definitely reach out of you have any more questions :)",

In terms of opportunities, it depends on what you\u2019re into, but it\u2019s super easy for undergrads to get involved in research and find mentors.",

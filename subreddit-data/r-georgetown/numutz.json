Our alumni network in real estate is quite extensive and students place very well. Look up the Steers Center if you're interested and feel free to shoot me a DM if you want to know more.",

The Real Estate program can also be completed fully online if that\u2019s of interest at all either. \n\nObviously, you have a lot of time to consider all of your options both academic and career wise, but if you did want to get into real estate - you could certainly do that in a variety of ways at Georgetown.",

Although I\u2019m not sure of your budget, I highly recommend you stay there bc it\u2019s right in the center of Georgetown and walking distance from campus. But you can always get an air bnb or stay in a hotel farther out (further into dc or in Rosslyn VA). \n\nFor restaurants and bars it all depends on who you are/what you\u2019re looking for. Are you a prospective student? Or just an adult visiting the area?",

Since you are actually an adult you probably don\u2019t want to go to the college bars that the students go to. If you want good beer, I\u2019d try the soveirgn (right next to el centro). But nightlife wise it might be better to go into DC (Navy yard comes to mind as a neighborhood to go to).\n\nTbh I don\u2019t really know too much about the non-student nightlife here.",

            "comment": "Posting my reply from the now deleted thread. \n\nMy only piece of advice for hotels is to look on a map before booking. Some hotels have \u201cGeorgetown\u201d in the name, but are really in the next neighborhood over. Not a bad walk, but also not Georgetown.\n\nIf you\u2019ll want to walk to see other neighborhoods, I suggest staying in East Village (east of Wisconsin avenue). West Village is just that much further from nearby neighborhoods and metro (Dupont and Foggy Bottom). If your priority is being near the university campus, you\u2019ll want West Village.\n\nBoulangerie Christophe for French pastries, delicious quiche, and sandwiches. \n\nBlue Bottle or Compass for coffee. Baked and Wired also does good coffee, but the cupcake line is often daunting. If you go there, there is usually a separate line for coffee, that splits to the right. Unless you want a cupcake, don\u2019t waste your time standing in the cupcake line. You can get banana bread, zucchini bread, and usually a cake slice option in the coffee line. They also have great almond croissants and savory biscuits, if there are any left by the time you get there.\n\nGreen Almond Pantry for lunch. I\u2019ve never had something here I didn\u2019t love.\n\nChaia Tacos for vegetarian tacos. The sweet potato nachos are my favorite.\n\n90second Pizza is actually very decent pizza for the price and speed. Check them out if you\u2019re looking for quick and casual. \n\nReren has unique Chinese dishes and is quite good.\n\nYellow Cafe is great for lunch as well. This place is very popular, especially on nice weekends, so be prepared for a line. Try the baklava croissant.\n\nEnjoy your time in Georgetown!",

    "postText": "Hello!   \n\n\nI am an incoming graduate student struggling to find sub-1.2k housing within 30 mins walking distance to the university. I've been considering some basements, but since I am unable to tour in-person, I'm finding it hard to determine whether I am ok with the environment. Thus, I'm hoping to get some honest opinions from basement-dwellers in the Georgetown area: what are some pros and cons? What should I watch out for when renting a basement?\n\n  \nThanks in advance!",

                    "comment": "Thank you for bringing rats to my attention. My previous basement living experience only consisted of dead crickets, so I definitely overlooked that. Considering how many rat references I've been seeing on this sub I'm kind of concerned at this point... If you have time, would you mind talking about the rat experience a bit more? I should be able to sleep through scratching in the vents or whatever, but I'm not sure how I feel about having to constantly guard my food or being aware that rats might decide to check if I'm edible in the middle of the night etc.  \n\n\nAlso, are there particularly rat-infested areas that people inexperienced with coexisting with rats should absolutely avoid?",

Is there some way to estimate who's charging a reasonable price for a basement, or some way to estimate basement quality based on price? For example, what's would be the difference between a 850$/mo basement and a 1000$/mo basement if one of them is only 0.2 miles farther from the university?",

We loved it because of the space and we had access to the backyard (we were more ground level than underground) \n\nWe did not have vermin or bug issues and our apartment got pretty good light. The biggest issue is that it was always cold!",

Half of our apartment was tied to the third floor and half was tied to the second. If you have your own thermostat I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be okay",

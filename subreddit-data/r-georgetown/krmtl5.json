            "comment": "From the Office of Student Financial Services:\n\n&gt;Financial aid for international students is extremely limited. To be considered for one of these awards, you must indicate your interest on your application for undergraduate admission and complete the CSS PROFILE. If you do not receive a scholarship in your first year, you will not be offered a scholarship in future years and you should plan your finances accordingly. If you were offered financial aid your first year, you must reapply for financial aid every year and will be re-evaluated based on the information on your financial aid application.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily count on major financial aid as an international student.  Having said that, I wouldn't let this keep you from applying.",

Idk if application strength plays into it, because I\u2019d consider myself a pretty decent applicant too, but I\u2019d be cautiously optimistic.",

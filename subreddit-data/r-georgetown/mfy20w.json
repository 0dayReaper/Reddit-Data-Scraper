You can choose to go into Phase 1 as a group of 4, then you can have a chance at selecting a suite in Copley or Arrupe (2 doubles + bathroom), or you can skip Phase 1. If you skip Phase 1, or there are no suites left, you form a group of 2 for Phase 2. You and your roommate can then select a double room. \n\nAs a sophomore, singles and apartments are unlikely unless, again, special circumstances.",

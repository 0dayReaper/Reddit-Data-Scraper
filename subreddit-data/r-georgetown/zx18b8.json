    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all. While I\u2019m thrilled that I got into Georgetown, I\u2019m pretty worried about affordability. The Net Price Calculator currently estimates an annual payment of $20k, which I\u2019m willing to work with, but I\u2019ve read stories about people getting no aid despite their EFC being 0.\n\nDoes Georgetown give good financial aid? For those that ran the Net Price Calculator, how accurate was it?",

            "comment": "Hello! I transferred to Georgetown and enrolled in the undergrad CS program. Talking about the government opportunities that Georgetown affords its students would be great to addition to your essay. If you can be specific about how Georgetown can facilitate these opportunities, that would be even better. For instance, if you\u2019re interested in cyber security, you can talk about how you\u2019re interested in the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service program: https://cyberfellows.georgetown.edu/\n\nI hope this helps! Good luck!",

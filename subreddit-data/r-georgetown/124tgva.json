    "postText": "What's up y'all? I am a college student at WashU who got lucky enough to find an internship in DC for the summer. I am looking for a place to live during my time there and was wondering if anyone had a space they would be willing to sublease to me? I am super flexible but would need the space from the beginning of June until at least the end of July, but being able to stay the first two weeks of August would be ideal. Let me know! I'm happy to provide any other information needed! Thank you! Best of luck to you all as the semester winds down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn another note, y'all mad or happy about Ewing being fired?",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman and will be in the last registration block for fall 2021 rip so id appreciate some tips. Is it worth it to make super detailed multiple back up plans or will most classes be filled by the last group? What\u2019s the best way to prepare for worst case scenarios?\n\nAnd also for some classes like WRIT 015 that have a capacity of 15, I see that there are already 7 \u2018Actual\u2019 and 8 \u2018Remaining\u2019. Is this because some seats are reserved for upperclassmen?",

Waitlists do move and it's best to be on them as soon as possible to increase your odds.",

[schedule.georgetown.edu](https://schedule.georgetown.edu) will update all day on registration day so you can see as classes fill up and adjust your plans accordingly. All upperclassmen have already registered, so \"actual\" is those people (or sometimes I think they reserve spots for athletes) and \"remaining\" is open spots. Hope this helps, good luck!",

Also be sure to have some sticky note with the class codes so you can either copy and paste or see them during registration. Coursicle is a great website to see if a class fits in ur schedule or not and it apparently tells you if a class has open seats.",

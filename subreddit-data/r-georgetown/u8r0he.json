            "comment": "IPOL has a required stats class, CULP does not. CULP will require you to take some classes with a humanities angle but you have overall more flexibility to count courses for that major (you choose your specific theme of study and can argue for any course to fit within it).\n\nBut you have a year and a half or so to decide. Focus on your core classes first and that should give you a sense of what major to do. Who knows, you might discover a love of econ or history or business and go that route instead.",

            "comment": "CULP is very flexible, whereas IPOL is very rigid. Some people prefer having a firm structure to their major, whereas some people prefer being able to take whatever classes they want. You don't need to worry about it now, since you don't need to declare a major until your sophomore spring, and your declaration will be informed a lot by your experience taking classes and navigating the core.",

            "comment": "Hi, the comment the other person made about the course numbers will be pretty effective in sorting out graduate vs undergraduate courses for you.\n\nAs to the other parts of your question, BADM seems to be short for Business Administration. Georgetown\u2019s business school department (the MSB) divides its classes into these subject areas: ACCT, BADM, FINC, MARK, MGMT, OPIM, and STRT.\n\nLooking at the Coursicle summaries of the BADM vs MGMT course lists, the registrar seems to be using BADM as a somewhat miscellaneous subject area. Many of the BADM classes could be reclassified into one of the other areas\u2014sometimes it can even be just for practical budgetary, educational accreditation/ reporting, or other internal registrar office reasons that they needed to make a new, miscellaneous category. I used to work for a university registrar and yeah\u2014they do all kinds of reporting and statistical studying on class outcomes, and I think they probably created the BADM category for some budgetary or reporting reason. No functional difference for the student.\n\nMGMT is classes associated with the philosophy of management and business psychology (like the advice in the book \u201c7 Habits of Highly Effective People.\u201d) And you can browse the Coursicle to get a sense of what\u2019s to be found in the other business categories: ACCT, FINC, MARK, OPIM, and STRT.\n\nHere\u2019s the link to Georgetown\u2019s Coursicle: https://www.coursicle.com/georgetown/courses/\n\nAnd the website actually has a spot where you can see, class by class, what is required for each undergraduate business major or graduate business degree. Browse through the blue box near the top of the page here. Click on the program you want, then click on the links that say \"Curriculum\" on the following page. https://msb.georgetown.edu/\n\nGood luck! I\u2019m sure you would make a great Hoya.",

Classes within the 0-499 range are usually available for everyone, but not always. But in those higher level classes, you\u2019ll often have phd candidates, masters students and underclassmen.",

I also recorded a video of the bus arriving and leaving with no issue lol. The nurse parked on the other side of the street and is obviously working long shifts at the hospital was told to kick rocks and \u201cobserve the signs\u201d during our appeal. I was let off the hook. \n\nIt still cost me $25 to find parking at the courthouse lmao.",

    "postText": "I was really worried throughout this year because I\u2019m an international freshman that\u2019s attending classes asynchronously, so I was never going to have that same degree of interaction that other people would be having in classes and clubs and stuff. I was really worried that I\u2019d pull up in august and everyone else would have friend groups and I\u2019d be stuck on my own, especially because I know very little about the US college system \n\nBut that changed! I started talking to people through stuff like cornerstone, talked to a few people from my classes and sent some emails to some kind looking people in the recordings, and now I\u2019ve got a bit of a friend group going! I\u2019m feeling really lucky that people at Georgetown are so open and lovely, I just wanted to make that known xo",

We usually don\u2019t get the first set of interviewees until early October, so probably just haven\u2019t got out yet. \n\nTo the comment saying you won\u2019t get an interview, while I don\u2019t know for sure that EVERY applicant gets an interview, I\u2019ve interviewed people with no chance of getting in.",

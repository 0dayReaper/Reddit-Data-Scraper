    "postText": "Standup Comedy Wrestling is a comedy competition where WWE meets humor. There'll be roasts, jokes, and an expensive grand prize for the funniest comedian of the night. The comics come from all over the world and the winner will be judged by a secret committee and the audience's reaction.\n\nDoing the announcing is Angel Penn, one of the most talented, good looking, and disrespectful comedians you'll ever meet. Your other announcer is some nerd not worth further acknowledgement, Michael something or other.\n\nAt SCW the competition is real, the grand prize is real, and we only keep it real\u2026 real mean.",

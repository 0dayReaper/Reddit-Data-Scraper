    "postText": "I was accepted into the SFS and am thinking about attending in the fall. I love Georgetown, but my concern is that I will feel a severe sense of imposter syndrome because I never did MUN and am not so well-versed in international affairs (not really at all). I'm also borderline fluent in a language other than English. My question is: are all SFS students crazy smart and know everything about everything going on in the world? Will it be difficult for me to keep up with the curriculum alongside such peers? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Here's the deal: the SFS has a spectrum of students. Some think they're the next Jason Bourne, but they can't run a mile. Others think they'll be Mother Teresa or the next Hillary Clinton but have never worked in a soup kitchen or volunteered in their free time. Most will end up riding a desk in an uninteresting State Department role or some unimportant hill staffing position (after landing a \"competitive\" internship there) or doing some weird consulting for a government adjacent company. All will make sure that you know that they were \"SFS\" kids. \n\nThe *really* hot shit SFS kids apply for a 5 year masters program after their freshman/sophomore years, don't know if they do it  for juniors   \n too. Think undergrad SFS then a masters in security/ msfs or something. They also take science courses or get additional languages. Sorry but it's easier to teach mathematics major water security policy in idlib province Syria than it is to teach a peace and justice major organic chemistry 1&amp;2.\n\nMy advice to you: don't ***ever*** let anyone at Georgetown or wherever make you feel inferior, especially in the foreign service realm. First year classes are all about writing and reading skills -&gt; go to  the writing tutor center in Lau library if you need  guidance. First year classes (some) are also designed to humble kids, so cut yourself a break if you don't crush it from day 1. Map of the Modern world is a great time to make friends, actually very useful class. Diversify your course-load (see sciences above, consider going STIA)",

Although there\u2019s a certain intimidation of getting involved with SFS students, one has to remember that we\u2019re a much more tight knit community than it appears.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you in the fall!",

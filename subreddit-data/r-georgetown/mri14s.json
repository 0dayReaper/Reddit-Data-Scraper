    "postText": "Ok so I'm seeing in Georgetown's health insurance policy that they don't do birth control so - where do people go for it? Aside from the obvious reason I have pretty debilitating menstrual pain that's helped by birth control, so I really don't want to have to stop taking it while I wait for their people to decide it's medically necessary. Any tips? What have other people done for this?",

You will probably need a note from your doctor, and it's kind of annoying but they have committed to covering it.",

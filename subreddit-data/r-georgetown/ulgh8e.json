Some people opt for Intro to Logic as their second philosophy. But again, your LSAT, GPA, essays, and resume are all factors as well! You could also do a lot of public service internships that prepare you for law. Im graduating this month and will be headed to Tulane Law, and was able to intern for the DOJ. Something to consider also is the Pre-Law CALL (Capitol applied learning lab). This is new but you would do a pre-law internship and take two electives while living in downtown DC!",

Is anyone familiar with the best commuting options to get to Georgetown from McLean. \n\nI know commuter grad students can park after 5pm for $5, but I'm wondering what the best course of option metro-wise would be. \n\nAnyone have experience commuting from the NoVa suburbs into gtown for classes?",

I could get from there to/from main campus via kirby, chain bridge then canal in 20 minutes or less if between 8:30am-4:00pm or after 7:30pm. Peak rush hour could be 50 minutes, but most often 30-35 minutes. Going through Arlington and Rosslyn works fine, but that anyways was a solid 20 min + waiting for bus + bridge traffic. \n\nSo, it depends on how much your time is worth to you and whether you could find something very near campus. Personally, I'd use some of the saved money from not paying rent for private parking on DC side, either in burleigh or Georgetown.",

I definitely don't expect that to be the case for commuting so the additional input helps. I might try to see if I can out a parking spot from someone else near campus. I'm just admittedly crap at parallel parking and I currently drive a somewhat large SUV so the idea of street parking scares me lol.",

In 2017, Georgetown received top honors as the most environmentally sustainable university. The Princeton Review offers a comprehensive perspective on the top green colleges, which weighs factors such as sustainable food sources, waste management and campus recycling, environmental study opportunities, greenhouse gas emissions, sustainability committees and officers, and more.*",

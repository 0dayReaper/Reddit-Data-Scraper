    "postText": "Hi, I'm a pre-frosh and I'm interested in taking the intensive Japanese class but it seems there's only 9 spots left between both of the level 1 classes right now. Worst case scenario, if it does fill up by the time I get to sign up, what are the odds of getting into the class from the waitlist? I really want to take Japanese for my language requirement since I plan on majoring in International Business so I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about this, any advice would be appreciated :)",

There's a form and if you ask your professor if they can take one more person in the class they might sign the form and you then can take it. So if you don't get in think about asking the prof for a write-in.",

I'm a Japanese minor myself and spots don't tend to go by *that* quickly, but even if they do, the deans make getting people into the language classes they need a very high priority. If you do end up on the waitlist, I'd reach out to your professor (if it's Sato-sensei she's a queen btw) and/or your dean.",

Even if the spots fill up, you can just write the professor (I'm assuming Sato-Sensei) and after about a week of class, you can get officially registered. I would know - I did that exact same thing myself last year!\n\n\u304c\u3093\u3070\u3063\u3066\uff01:D",

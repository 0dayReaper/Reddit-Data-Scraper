I also feel like I've met some people that act like a politician in that every interaction with you has a greater purpose/motive besides hanging out.

As a former staff member as well, I can vouch that they do not give two shits about the student body or the staff; it is all about the bottom line for them.\n\nThat said, the deans and (most of) the support staff are hardworking. IMO, we have a fairly solid faculty as well.",

If any lgbtq students or anyone at all can weigh in on queer culture at Georgetown for me that would be awesome, thanks.",

I recommend you take a look at [Georgetown\u2019s LGBTQ Resource Center website](https://lgbtq.georgetown.edu/). When I was coming to terms with my sexuality, I went there and found it to be very useful!",

Being the snobby private dc school is not the easiest cultural legacy to get rid of, but for every conservative group there are 5 LGBT Hoya groups.\n\nAnd speaking for my department, we do not take any bullying/bigotry lightly.\n\nGeorgetown (especially if you're going for gov or foreign service) does have a lot of type A weirdos, but look in between them and you can always find your people :)",

Even in the republican club, campus ministry, and ROTC there are a few openly gay guys.\n\nAnd yes Georgetown is a catholic school, but it is nothing like one of those insane hardcore catholic schools such as Benedictine college in Kansas. Most of the catholics here are liberal/moderate catholics who may be more conservative on a few niche issues such as abortion.",

    "postText": "Hi y'all,\n\nAlthough I am not a GU student, I am a student from a Midwestern school looking for summer 2023 housing in the GU/DC/DMV area for my internship! I will be living with two other roommates, and we will be commuting to our respective jobs that are about an hour's train ride outside of DC (we do not have cars).\n\nBesides FB groups and AirBnB, what would be some recommendations on finding a sublet? One of my GU friends mentioned it'd be most likely that we find a junior/senior who's looking to sublease, so I thought I could expand the search here. Please DM if you're interested in additional details about our summer living preferences! Thanks y'all :)",

If you would be okay with living in a dorm (a really good option because guaranteed furniture) both colleges do summer housing for interns even if you don't go there. AU does too, and they have a summer housing building right next to the red line metro if thats something you'd be interested in. I've also interned with people who lived in a very big intern house without knowing each other beforehand. You should check and see if any housing like that exists in an area you are interested in. There should be some by the Hill.",

Harbin has a central location, Darnall is a little far away from things but they're otherwise unremarkable. Copley is becoming a freshman dorm this year and will be nice (historic building recently renovated, suites of two rooms connected by a private bathroom). \n\nRoommate wise, you can look in the groupmes/social media pages, but Georgetown also offers a matching services known as CHARMS where it gives you a suggested list of people to chat with based on your living preferences. \n\nRealize that the dorms are not fancy, but they're really fine.",

            "comment": "\"best dorms\" is really subjective because it is based on what you are looking for in your freshman dorm. Imo, the best thing you can do is give yourself as much options as you can. So I suggest posting yourself on the Class of 2025 fb page and see who is interested in rooming with you. Also, consider applying to living learning communities since you might have a chance to be with people who share the same interests as you. That's about it.",

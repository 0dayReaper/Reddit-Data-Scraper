    "postText": "just out of curiosity, how difficult would it be to transfer from the college to the sfs sophomore year? could you still graduate on time? i know there\u2019s a more intensive language req but i\u2019m fluent in the language i take so i think that would be ok\u2026 it\u2019s just the other parts of the respective cores for each school that could be more challenging to get done. has anyone done that before?? how was it??",

            "comment": "Talk to your academic advisor - intra-transfer is not uncommon. Basically, you would need to have a 3.0 GPA and above for serious consideration. It also helps if you have some overlapping requirements already. That said, the SFS general education reqs are a bit more specific than the College, as a heads up.\n\nAs mentioned, your academic advisor or dean would be able to map out this process for you.\n\nSource: I used to work in the College Dean\u2019s office and was directly involved in this procedure each term.",

The other poster is basically correct - get solid grades and take language (if you\u2019re fluent at reading and speaking, maybe you don\u2019t need to, but make sure to note this at each step in the process) and Econ. \n\nDefinitely tell your dean as soon as possible so they can advise you.",

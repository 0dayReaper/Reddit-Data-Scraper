I am trying to get a parking permit so I can park in 2E (zone for Georgetown) but it seems like I would have to register the car in DC, which would be fine, but the excise tax is pretty hefty based on what I looked at. Has anyone had any luck getting parking permits as a student in Georgetown? Any advice would be helpful.",

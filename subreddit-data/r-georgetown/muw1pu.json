Basically all the dorms that are not apartments and not freshman dorms. Be aware that housing is going to be a little weird this year though with no/less study abroad and more seniors applying to live on campus, so some dorms might be tighter than usual, and the Leavey Hotel will also be converted into a dorm.\n\nEdit: Looks like no Copley for sophomores this year, and all of Village C for sophomores.",

    "postText": "Hey Hoyas,\nI've just been accepted to the MA in PM on site program and I'm trying make an informed decision.\n\nI know classes are adjusted to typical working hours, but what does this mean exactly? What's the time frame you usually spend sitting in class?\n\nAnother question I have is, what on campus jobs are available, what would you recommend? I'm an international graduate student and I'll be allowed to work 20hs on campus per my visa.\n\nThanks a lot!",

    "postText": "I\u2019m thinking about applying to several consulting clubs (innovo, hilltop, DCivitas) and was wondering how competitive these clubs actually are. I\u2019ve heard mixed things about them, but is it true that the acceptance rate for these clubs is &lt;10%? If so, what are some good alternatives if and when I get utterly rejected by all three clubs?",

            "comment": "Clubs on campus, especially pre-professional clubs like the ones you listed, can be very competitive. I don\u2019t have specific numbers, but it can be very difficult. People tend to apply multiple times over multiple semesters, and eventually find one. \nThese clubs are cool if you have your heart set on consulting. If you want to spend your college career heavily invested in what you might do afterwards, then great. I know multiple people who find it exhilarating and fun to run nearly full-time financial analysis clubs. However, it isn\u2019t for everybody. There are plenty of clubs that cater to all interests, and even more interesting people who you can have grow, develop and learn with. If you, as you say, get utterly rejected by all three, use it as an opportunity to try something new or something that you really care about. Perhaps you have a class you\u2019re really interested in, get to know the professor and try to really excel. You can also just spend one semester or 10 finding yourself, even if everyone else around you seems to have it all figured out (Georgetown is extraordinarily this way). \n\nSo, essentially, if you want to get a super head start and jump into a professional practice, keep trying, networking and searching to get a spot. If not, find something that makes you happy, gives you quality time with good friends, and distracts you from the at times overwhelming environment that is Georgetown University.",

            "comment": "its good that you understand the possibility of being rejected and are planning for it. most freshman dont tbh. one thing you could do is look for interesting clubs that have roles that allow you to explore your interest. for example, if youre into finance but dont get any finc clubs, the lecture fund has finance-oriented roles that are fairly easy to get (if you get in of course) but yeah try to see if theres a cool club that could still give u good experience. also, you could try to find something unique ie sports or other club. lots of my interviews have been with ex club basketball kids just by chance. by doing something niche, at worst you have a really cool talking point",

            "comment": "One thing you have to understand is that people want to be in clubs with their friends. Pretty much everyone applying to the clubs are going to be qualified and competitive for admission to them. If you want to join the clubs you need to actively participate in their events and get to know the members and leadership. If all you do is fill out an application, you are not going to be admitted. You must demonstrate that you are committed and that you get along with the group.",

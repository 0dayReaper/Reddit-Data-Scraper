                            "comment": "Absolutely. My professors ranged from:\n\n1. General Counsel (attorney) for CISA\n\n2. Career Army Signal Officer, Lieutenant Colonel, who\u2019s now a CISO for a Cybersecurity company.\n\n3. Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for Dell/also worked on the IETF and created the TLS 1.3 encryption protocol standard.\n\n4. MSNBC Cybersecurity Subject Matter Expert\n\n5. Principle Cybersecurity Engineer for the MITRE Corporation and Director of the Cybersecurity Department at the National Defense University.\n\nIt was very rigorous program. I\u2019m a veteran and the VA paid for my degree, but mandated I take 2-3 classes a semester. Working full-time and doing that was really rough the last two years. I\u2019m looking forward to sleeping once I graduate.\n\nI was accepted into a doctoral program (EdD) at a state school. Normally, the program is 61 credits, however due to the prestige of Georgetown\u2019s name and being known for their quality, and rigorous, programs, they\u2019re giving me 27-30 credit hours due to my masters. Great program. The people who diss the SCS are usually undergrads, who haven\u2019t even graduated college yet, and are just upset we don\u2019t fall under their \u201ceducational institutional elitism\u201d theory of paying $200K+ in tuition for a degree.",

They are CEO\u2019s, lawyers, business  executives: all people who are teaching us real business skills. You will see in a lot of programs that the professors are just academics. Though a lot of classes are online I feel extremely connected not only to my class, but the school. Also the program has really great job placement. 10/10 would recommend! Let me know if you have any other questions. I hear that program is fun. Maybe check out George Mason too. They have an amazing cyber security program.",

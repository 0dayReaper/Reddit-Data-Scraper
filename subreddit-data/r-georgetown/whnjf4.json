I found an apartment in Rosslyn, Arlington VA, but it's unfurnished, and I have no experience with furnishing a place and was wondering if anyone can give me some advice considering I don't drive and this is very new to me.\n\nCould you recommend places or get furniture or best ways to actually furnish the apartment? It's ground floor. \n\nThank you all in advance!",

Back in my grad school days (and on a grad student budget) we usually bought from ikea. Their delivery fees are modest, but you will need to spend a day assembling your furniture. Amazon also has a wide selection of budget furniture and their delivery is faster than ikea, normally. For beds in particular, you might look at some of the direct to consumer brands like nectar/Casper/etc., they all ship directly to your apartment and are relatively inexpensive. \nHabitat for humanity restores are a charity furniture reseller that would be a low budget option if you could find a driver and truck to pick up your furniture (you can rent trucks from uhaul, or lowes, but would need a driver/someone to help you move your furniture). Finally, it might be worth posting for moving assistance on your department\u2019s listserv, a lot of grad students might help out for a case of beer and it would be a good way to meet people in your department!",

For the rest of the stuff, if money is a concern, browse Facebook for people trying to give stuff away. When I tried to sell furniture on Facebook in Georgetown, it was a huge buyers\u2019 market in that nobody would buy stuff unless it was free or very cheap. Issue is you often have to drive to pick it up so if you have a drivers\u2019 license then you can maybe rent a moving car for the day. If not, then something like ikea might be the move.",

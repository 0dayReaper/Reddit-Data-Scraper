    "postText": "Im a rising senior and I wanna major in IR/poli sci wherever I go in college, and I realized that gtown has no \u201cpoli sci\u201d major, just gov(?) and that it\u2019s not in the college where IR adjacent majors are in SFS\ud83d\ude2d. Is double majoring out of the question since they\u2019re in diff schools? I couldn\u2019t find a clear answer on their website. What other major combos would y\u2019all recommend (either within the college or SFS) to get a similar experience? Kinda lost rn so anything will help :)",

If you want to study domestic politics in any capacity I\u2019d recommend doing IPOL in the SFS and a minor in Gov. but really I thinking picking a school and taking the subsequent major (IPOL or Gov) then a minor across the schools",

Since you're interested in IR it's definitely the route to go. Plus there are disciplines related to local government and you can elect courses from different core concentrations.",

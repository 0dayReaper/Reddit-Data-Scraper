I took a call from one of the program advisors and they walked me through how it works and it seems like an awesome program so I signed up for the summer. Basically, you watch video lessons in Canvas before the twice a week zoom sessions they call livelab. Seems like a great networking opportunity since you're talking to people and professionals in interesting jobs from all over the country multiple times a week, which was honestly a big selling point for me. And i liked how i could add whatever i work on to my portfolio/resume. There aren't any tests either so like...I was happy about that lol. I think it's worth it and the program advisor guy answered all my questions. :)",

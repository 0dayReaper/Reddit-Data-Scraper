    "postText": "Hey guys, One day I would like to attend this university but I am not at the stage where applying to college is in the near future. Currently I am a sophomore at a Jesuit highschool and would like to apply to the Summer Law Academy program. I am pretty good at English the honors course at my highschool is pretty difficult but I get As in most of my papers. However I am having trouble writing the personal statement for my application. The prompt is a simple : upload a 300-500 word essay addressing why you want to attend a summer program at Georgetown. I would like to be a lawyer one day and as you all know the campus is gorgeous but I\u2019ve never really written anything like this before so I\u2019m kind of stuck. I know you are supposed to make it about YOU and why you\u2019re unique and deserve to go but still I\u2019m stuck. (Side notes: my dad is an ap lang teacher so he can take a look and my freshman English teacher who will be my junior ap teacher is an alum and loves so I could get a great rec if I apply)",

(Talk about clubs and communities and surrounding DC area in this case, and how YOU will specifically use them for your own benefit)\n\nWhy this program at Georgetown? (What are you hoping to do with this program? Transition from what you\u2019ve been doing before this program, and what you hope to do after. Essentially a past present future type of format)\n\nWho you are as a person (talk about who you are, and how these programs support your personality/beliefs. Integrate this throughout your essay but don\u2019t make it one separate paragraph)\n\nGood luck!",

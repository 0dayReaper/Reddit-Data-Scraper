    "postText": "I know Georgetown has become a lot more lgbtq friendly in the past couple of years (even more so than a lot of nonsectarian colleges), but what is queer student life like? \n\nI'm guessing (but not sure) that there are a lot of the normal queer clubs and groups, however, what is the general attitude and environment like for a queer student. For context, I was planning on going to Reed where a HUGE portion of the student body identifies as lgbtq (their unofficial moto ls communism, atheism, and free love lmao), but am a bit scared that I won't find the environment I want at Georgetown. Is the student body typically pretty accepting or does the stereotype of preppy conservative private school kids hold up? \n\nDo you think that I'll be able to find some people and an environment that I would have gotten at a liberal arts college that has a more established queer community?",

            "comment": "Georgetown is a pretty queer school. I graduated more than 5 years ago, and there was a lot of queer life. Drag balls, coming out day celebration in Red Square, lots of other events, big Westboro Baptist Church counter protest, etc. Since I\u2019ve graduated, I believe there are even more queer student groups focused on the business school, QPOC, and maybe others. A lot of the queer culture was split up by other clubs (e.g., Corp, theater, GU Pride, LEAD, etc.) so it\u2019s not just one culture. I think that\u2019s probably good because you can choose the way you want to be queer. DC in general is also a very queer city, though some of the 18+ nightlife has closed in the last several years. \n\nQueer culture may not be the core GU culture the way it is at some secular liberal arts schools, but it is very present and active.\n\nEdit: Just noting that while I did know trans and non-binary folks as an undergrad, I can\u2019t really speak to their experience, as a cis gay man myself.",

Just before we went off campus last Spring GU Pride/Hoyas for Choice led a protest of the Cardinal O\u2019Connor Conference, and we were pretty compatible in size to the conference itself. To be sure there are some preppy, conservative kids, but that really depends on what kinda social circles you find yourself falling into, and I would say the overall environment is very progressive and accepting.",

It may be less liberal than Reed or Berkeley, but it is certainly more liberal than it is conservative, and it\u2019s a diverse campus with tons of people with a wide variety of identities.",

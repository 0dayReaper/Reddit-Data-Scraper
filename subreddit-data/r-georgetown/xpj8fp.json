            "comment": "that's typically not how interviews are assigned. Usually you submit the application (or perhaps a partial application) and you are matched with an alumni interviewer. You then both get an email with each other's contact info. You (the applicant) are supposed to reach out to the alumni to schedule an interview. If the interviewer doesn't hear from you 2 weeks after the email goes out, they reach out to you -- but they never schedule an interview without contacting you first.\n\nAs far as whether you have to submit an application first: yes, I don't think you can see the supplemental questions without paying the fee, but I am very surprised that they matched you with an interview without you submitting anything. Have not heard of that happening, but I suppose it's possible.",

But you could reach out and ask them to schedule it for several weeks from now, if you aren't applying early. \n\nI misunderstood - I thought you were saying they had already scheduled it for you and it was in the coming week.",

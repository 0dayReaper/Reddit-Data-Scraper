    "postText": "I got placed in Darnall Hall for my freshman year and I'm wondering what it's like. I've heard that it's the worst (?) freshman dorm but does it deserve that reputation? Are there any tips or advice to know about the dorm?\n\nI'll be taking BIOL-103 and I'm not sure if I should buy the print or digital version of the textbook (Biology: How Life Works by James Morris). Also, for anyone who's taken MATH-035, are the bookstore recommended Calculus: Early Transcendentals (Looseleaf) - With Access resources needed or helpful?",

            "comment": "Darnall is the worst because they\u2019re the smallest rooms with no sink (like new south) and no bathroom (like Village C), and it\u2019s on the far north side of campus far from everything, opposite corner of campus as the dining hall which freshman clearly rely on.\n\nFor Foundations 1, you don\u2019t have to buy the book if you want to. I would recommend showing up and see how you do with the lectures and stuff and if you\u2019re not doing well enough then look into the book and see if you would use it a lot if you bought it.",

On the other hand, the textbook for MATH-035 was a great resource for studying for exams + the department-wide final, though its in-class use kinda depends on which prof you have.\n\nYou might need the Pearson access for your course homework (all my calc courses at gtown have used pearson for hw assignments), but if you need to save a little money you can buy the access separately and DM me to get the textbook pdf.",

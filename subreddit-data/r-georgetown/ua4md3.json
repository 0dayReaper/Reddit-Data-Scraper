My daughter will be a grad student at GU and also a TA for night classes. We found the perfect place. There are  some other places that aren\u2019t nearly as  nice but  do  not require a walk through the park. I really appreciate it. We\u2019re going to look at  places today so your timing was perfect.",

Do you Uber to and from Trader Joe\u2019s or Safeway? I was very surprised at the dearth  the grocery stores in the immediate area.  Thanks again!",

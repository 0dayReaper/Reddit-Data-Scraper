I\u2019m currently a junior in Dubai and am coming this summer for the 2 week entrepreneurship course. Just wanted to see if there\u2019s people who have done the course before and share their experiences.",

I met some cool people that ended up coming to school here too but that\u2019s about it. Maybe it was the specific program that I did but I learned nothing. Just spent a couple of weeks in DC during the worst time of the year to be in DC. I say if you\u2019re really looking for something to do over the summer and want to see what the school is like, go for it, but otherwise there are better ways to spend your summer.",

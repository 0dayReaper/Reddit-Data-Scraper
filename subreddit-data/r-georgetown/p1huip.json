I'm an incoming freshman and I don't have much past job experience.\n\nAlso, I'm wondering how intensive are the front-desk jobs? Are they super busy? If not, can you like, do your readings or homework while you're there? \n\nAny info would be appreciated, thanks. :)",

As with any opportunity, the workload varies per office. For instance, if you are stationed to swipe dorm IDs, you can expect a steady flow of work (albeit straightforward work). You could get away with studying, reading, or working on assignments at the desk, etc.\n\nIf you are an administrative assistant for an academic or program office, you may be assigned other tasks and projects as necessary. As an incoming first year, most on-campus employers will work with you to determine what works best for both parties and won't overwhelm you from day one.\n\nTo be clear, I would not ask your employer directly if you could multitask while performing your job. It is more or less implied (and understood) that the less labor intensive jobs enable students to do other work. Opportunities can be competitive, so take any and all that are available to you and then discern where you can gauge your schedule and work around that context.\n\nSource: I was a work-study student and later a manager of student employees.",

If you\u2019re eligible, I think we have work/study too? Not totally sure, but it\u2019s worth a shot.",

More jobs will be posted in the coming weeks so don\u2019t freak out if you don\u2019t see what you want right now.\n\nFront desk jobs can vary but I think most have some spare time.",

Anyone have any recommendations from past experiences or general advice?\n\nI would love the warm weather in Sydney but Prague/Europe just seems more enjoyable as a study abroad site and the college experience. Would love to hear any thoughts",

            "comment": "Current junior in the MSB studying abroad in Dublin. Europe is definitely fun if you want to travel around since everything is accessible and cheap\\* (if you're willing to do the hostel lifestyle and travel at *ungodly* hours on Ryanair). However, I think it really depends on what you want out of a study abroad experience. For me, I did a bit of traveling at first but then realized how exhausted I was just jetting around to a new city for 48 hrs. I decided after my first few weeks here to not travel as much and really spend my time getting to know Dublin and Ireland, which I think has been a really cool experience in its own right because I now feel so comfortable here. I have friends studying abroad in other places who have literally spent every weekend traveling and barely know the city they're studying abroad in. I totally get the desire to see the world and \"make the most\" of your study abroad experience in that way, but just wanted to highlight that that is not the only way to do study abroad. The trips I went on were fun, but I've had a greater time making friends and hanging around Dublin . \n\nJust a reminder that there's no \"right\" way to do study abroad :) Both Prague and Sydney are great options and you really can't go wrong. Prague would be fun but Sydney could be such a unique experience where you really get to know the city and Australia.",

Ideally though not necessarily of your host country, but if not, at least of one of the majors - German, French, Spanish etc. Point being is that it can make mixing with the exchange students from other European countries all that more easier and fun. I\u2019d also resist the temptation to socialise more than necessary with other Anglophones, \u2018else you\u2019d might as well have done study abroad in an Anglophone country.",

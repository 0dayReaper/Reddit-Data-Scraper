            "comment": "Hi! I'm living in a McCarthy single this year. I have to say I'm fairly pleased with the size. My rough estimation is it's about 20' by 35'? I'm bad with distances, but either way, I have never wanted for more space. I even bought two extra small pieces of furniture for a more comfortable feeling, and I have never felt like I needed more room. The furnishings provided are pretty much just the ones you get in any Georgetown dorm room. You do have to share a bathroom and everything, which can suck sometimes, but that's just dorm life, I think. Anyway, I hope that helps! Lmk if you have any other questions.",

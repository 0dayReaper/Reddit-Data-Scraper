New South has the largest floors, so you're less likely to have a \"floor group,\" but that varies so much floor-by-floor every year anyway. \n\nAmenities: Village C has bathrooms in-room, New South sinks in-room, otherwise they're the same.\n\nYou don't get to choose in any case, unless you apply for an LLC or need medical housing.",

The university apparently renovated a lot of them but they are still freshmen dorms. Location-wise, Darnall is the worse I guess because it is literally in some isolated corner of the university. Unless you are NHS and you have classes at St. Mary, it will be leg day everyday for you to go anywhere. Harbin, VCW are kinda like in the center of the university so going to Leo's will be convenient and just better. In terms of people, its not like specific people are going to be in certain dorms. Your experience with people on your floor all depends on if you attend the events hosted by the RAs or if they even do anything.",

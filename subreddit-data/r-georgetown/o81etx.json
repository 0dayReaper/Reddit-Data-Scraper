    "postText": "I\u2019m going to be a MPP grad student in the fall and was interested if anyone would want to create a leftist book club with me. I was imagining a place to discuss theory and educate ourselves and those who want to know more, as well as doing some direct action (soup kitchens, supplying striking workers, organizing workplaces) on the side. All of this is extremely preliminary and off the cuff, but if any of this interests you, feel free to PM me. Open to undergrads and grads alike.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone I'm a prospective transfer student to Georgetown. I know the school isn't entirely a STEM school but I came across the Columbia Combined Program (CCP) \u2013 Preparation for Engineering Education. Is there anyone currently on track for this program? I'd love to talk about it with a current or former student about this. Thanks ahead of time",

It's more difficult than doing the traditional engineering route at a school with an engineering program and takes an extra year. A lot of the courses in the program are not really engineering focused, which is not necessarily bad. I think it's best suited for people who want the best of both worlds in terms of getting a degree in something else like economics plus engineering, especially because there are GPA requirements for being able to go through with it, or at least there were when I was still in college",

Do you think you want to be an engineer for your entire career? If so, go a more traditional route. If you want to expand beyond whatever engineering field, I'd say broaden your horizons. You'll find that as you grow in your career, it's important to be knowledgeable about more than a few topics so learning as many different, useful things in undergrad is super important. Highly recommend accounting, finance, and financial statement analysis classes - this stuff is the language of business and you will have to know it or else you will never get that far in your career. If you can afford to take on the extra year without paralyzing debt, I would also encourage that, too. \n\nJust my .02",

SWQ is where most sophomores are and you can find some larger rooms there, plus you have communal bathrooms, so you don't have to clean (or this can be your vice). All are pretty close to each-other, with SWQ being slightly closer to Leos and being a walk away from Yates.",

Note, those buildings have been renovated this past summer - something to keep in mind.",

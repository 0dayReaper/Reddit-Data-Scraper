    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI got a seat off the waitlist for Global Pathways with Prof. Marilyn McMorrow, while I'm already enrolled in Pandemic Responses with Prof. Katherine Marshall. Overall I prefer Prof. McMorrow's course's time, while I'm worried because the comments on Rate My Professor say she's a tough grader and somewhat pushy. Prof. McMorrow's overall rating was higher by only a bit, but the two ratings for the proseminar were quite good and say the work isn't overwhelming.\n\nA bit more info on my schedule this semester: I already have Econ 101 and Phil 099, which I heard are pretty hard.Should I just go with the \"easier\" seminar instead or is there little difference?\n\nIf you have taken any of these two, could you tell me if the comments are true? If you haven't, any suggestions for which to choose? I got until 3PM EST to choose!\n\nMany many thanks!",

If you\u2019re doing an intensive language, it could be a lot. Otherwise, you should be fine.",

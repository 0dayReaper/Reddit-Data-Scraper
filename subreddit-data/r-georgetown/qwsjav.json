    "postText": "hi there! was just wondering if anyone here knows of international students who have received finaid? the pool of money is super small and only given to a few of the int\u2019ls who apply for it, so i\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s distributed based on merit/ hooks/ extreme need/ something else.\n\nthank you!",

Without sounding too callous, at the end of the day, earning a degree abroad is a luxury for most.\n\nYour best bet is to contact the Office of Student Financial Services (the university\u2019s confusing label for finaid - check the sidebar) and speak with their counseling staff for more information.\n\nFrom what I recall, there are very few merit based scholarships for international students. Most of Georgetown\u2019s finaid is need-based aid.\n\nSource: I used to work in the finaid office.",

That one I\u2019m foggier on. It very well could have been in June.\n\nFor housing, I\u2019d just say pay attention to the updates and see if anyone you know coming/have met since being accepted would be interested in rooming (if you\u2019re interested as well). Pay attention when CHARMS comes out, fill out the preference section if they still do that, but I went random and my roommate ended up being one of my best friends here. I know not everyone is that lucky, but that\u2019s my experience.\n\nFor course registration, basically make sure you have Plan B, C, D, and E, because unless you\u2019re in the first slot, the classes you want to take can and will get filled up by other freshmen. Good luck!",

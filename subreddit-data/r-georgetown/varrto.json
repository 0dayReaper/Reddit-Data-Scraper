    "postText": "Hello! As the title states, I was hoping to hear directly from current Georgetown students. Do you feel like you made the right choice by attending Georgetown? Are there any cool traditions/events/favorite memories?\n\nTo current McDonough/SFS students, what have you grown to appreciate most about Georgetown, and what specifically about the Core Curriculum, class, professors, etc. have resonated with you the most?\n\nI would be grateful for any tips/advice:)",

            "comment": "Current rising junior in the MSB here. Have to say, the alumni network is absolutely amazing, especially if you want to do ibanking/consulting. Everyone\u2019s always willing to help you land that internship, as long as you\u2019re a nice person who\u2019s easy to talk to.\n\nAs for coursework, MSB classes are absolutely trivial and are a complete joke, except for the accounting sequence of the business core. For the interesting classes, SFS courses (I\u2019m in a joint MSB/SFS program) and College econ/philosophy/theology are way more intellectually stimulating. Can confirm that \u2018map of the modern world\u2019 is a good class as well as \u2018energy: players, markets, and project finance\u2019. CS courses are shit, except those taught by Cal Newport/Clay Shields. \u2018Problem of God\u2019 is a must take for your theology requirement, but it\u2019s a hit or miss depending on the prof.",

            "comment": "SFS alum here but hopefully some of the traditions from when I attended have persisted. The Tombs (study snacks, trivia nights, 80s nights or whatever decade is celebrated now, 99 days club), Wisey's cookies, snack runs at Vital Vittles, M Street, the Waterfront, Jettie's for lunch, walking over the Key Bridge for weekend dim sum. Harmony Cafe is a gem too. Ah this is turning into a list of my favorite dining spots. \n\n\nOverall, I felt there was a good balance between fun/interesting things to do both on and off campus. \n\n\nMost memorable courses: Map of the modern world, Fundamentals of Finance (Prof Ryan), and Intro to databases.",

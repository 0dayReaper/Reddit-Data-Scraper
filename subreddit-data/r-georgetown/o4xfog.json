    "postText": "Hey everyone! My best friend is an incoming freshman to the College and she is utterly confused on placement tests and when to take them. She doesn\u2019t have reddit so I\u2019m posting on her behalf.\n\nThere seems to be no good website or blurb about when placement tests are taken, when and for which subjects. If there\u2019s anyone more knowledgeable on the matter, please let us know.",

            "comment": "It depends on her school or program. For the College, there is a math placement test and a language placement test. For the latter, the student chooses which language. She may take them online or opt to take them in-person during New Student Orientation. She may take a test online and later opt to re-do it during NSO, too, I believe.\n\nYour friend\u2019s peer advisor or academic advisor would be able to provide more insight into the placement tests and expectations. Essentially, they are meant to guide new students in engaging with appropriate coursework.",

A lot of political clubs have pretty open memberships, or non-political clubs like GPB (program board) or GIVES.\n\nAs a freshman, I\u2019d try to go to CAB fair, pick a bunch of clubs to try, and then stick with 2-3 of them. Feel free to dm me with q\u2019s",

You'll be in a lot of the same classes going forward as the people in your major, so it's easy to build ties there. Clubs are also fun, and easy to make friends in with club/intramural sports!",

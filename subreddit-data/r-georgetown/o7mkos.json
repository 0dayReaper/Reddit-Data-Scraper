            "comment": "An appointment with the school will give you a more structured tour that will ensure you see every part of campus, but will be very curated and dependent on the student that gives you the tour. I would recommend doing one if you can, but I also think it\u2019s just as important to reach out to any current students you know at Georgetown. You will get a more personal and \u201creal\u201d perspective that can be very helpful in ultimately making your college decision. Definitely walk around the Georgetown neighborhood (O St and Prospect St down to Wisconsin Ave) as your tour won\u2019t go there, but it\u2019s a huge part of campus life.",

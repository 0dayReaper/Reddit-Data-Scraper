From what I remember, it was a standard amount that was something like $2-$3k. So, if your EFC was $15k, something like $2k would be student and $13k would be parent.",

So instead of having 100% of the outside money go towards your contribution, maybe 20% of it will (in my experience). This is BS, but it\u2019s how they do it. \n\nIf you\u2019re not on financial aid, then yes I would imagine outside scholarships would be very helpful.",

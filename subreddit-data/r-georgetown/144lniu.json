            "comment": "EDIT: I forgot to warn you yesterday, but as another commenter pointed out, Georgetown is not super accessible. I have trouble navigating the campus, and I'm still able to walk unassisted most of the time. The elevators are unreliable, there are hills and uneven ground everywhere, and not every building is up to code (they'll tell you they are but it's obvious they're not lmao). \n\n\nShort answer: no. \n\nLong answer: it depends on your dean, who you know, and how you prepare in advance for requesting accommodations. I would apply now, as I think the priority deadline for first-years and transfers is coming up. Housing and Academic accommodations are under different things, but that should all be on the ARC website (lmk if it's not and I will find it for you). You will want some sort of letter from your previous uni stating what accommodations you had there, as well as updated notes from your medical professionals reaffirming your diagnosis and reasoning for said accommodations. The same is true for both medical housing and academic accommodations. \n\nThe community is pretty small, and, from what I gathered as a first-year last year, it used to be worse. The university (under pressure from disabled students) recently hired Dr. Amy Kenny (she's awesome) as the inaugural director for the DCI (Disability Cultural Initiative) last year, and she's already made important changes for our community, including fostering a greater connection among disabled students. \nIf you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them! Also, if you want to meet up next semester as you start your time at the hilltop, I'm down for that too \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "Go for it. Undergraduate or graduate?\n\nI think my tip would be to be aware that there are different types of finance job outcomes. You could end up being anything from an investment advisor or private banker, which is more of a sales and customer service type of thing, to a Wall Street type investment banking (IB) analyst, to a quant, to working in crypto, to other things.\n\nHere is a page listing out all the divisions in Goldman Sachs. Maybe consider reading through each one and figure out which 2 or 3 sound like the best fit to you and why. When I was in college they actually had a whole personality test on the Goldman Sachs website matching you to your best fit department ([link](https://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-personality-hiring-interview-quiz-2011-6#if-you-want-to-be-a-trader-select-math-not-artshumanities-1)). That test is gone now, but you can accomplish the same thing by looking at the Goldman Sachs divisions yourself.\n\n[https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/divisions/index.html](https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/divisions/index.html)\n\nFinance is a big spectrum of outcomes, so yeah overall I recommend you learn more about the industry and learn more about yourself and figure out exactly what kind of finance job you're interested in.\n\nGood luck and Hoya Saxa",

I couldn\u2019t find a better fit for that than Georgetown. In general I wish to work on large scale asset management like taking clients investing their money and making a profit. I\u2019m pretty new to this stuff so any advice would be liquid gold to me.\n\nI should probably mention that I am applying for undergrad.",

They can help w resume building, networking, looking for jobs/internships, interview prep, etc. Also, many of the business clubs on campus have a recruiting division that can help w career opportunities. Saw you were interested in politics as well and I would definitely look into the Global Business major (integrated degree between the SFS and MSB) or the International Political Economy &amp; Business major in the MSB. Those are probably your best options if you want both the business and politics knowledge-base. As an aside, lots of ppl major in Finance bc they think they need to in order to get the Wall Street job--you don't. At gtown, the nice thing is we have a rly strong &amp; comprehensive MSB core curriculum, so you will learn everything you need to know for entry-level stuff thru that. Majors are more like concentrations (only 5-6 classes). Focus on creating your \"narrative\"--that will matter much more to employers. How do I know? Current IPEB major who did an internal transfer from the College my sophomore spring (so only had 1 sem of business classes under my belt) and still got an investment banking internship in NYC. Best of luck!",

    "postText": "Hi everyone :)\n\nI'm an incoming freshman at gtown and am looking forward to taking an Ignatius seminar. I know they have changed some of the classes, but other ones are the same. I was thinking about taking Human Flourishing in the East and West with professor cline. I wanted to look at other options too, so if you have any good experiences with the other teachers or classes please let me know! Looking forward to seeing you all on the hilltop next year",

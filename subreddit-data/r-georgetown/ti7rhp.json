I heard a lot about the new grad student housing 55H St, and was wondering if anyone knew how to lease from there/when that process starts. I really just want to get into that building and save myself the hassle of finding housing in DC lol.",

            "comment": "I'd recommend not living there if you're going to be attending SSP. It's going to take you minimum 45 minutes to get from H St. to Georgetown via public transit. I'd also guess that securing your own housing might be cheaper -- I don't know the student housing prices though.",

I had no clue honestly lol, I've been looking on FB and a lot of people are only doing summer subleases/it seems really difficult to find a place near the area. But I'm not from the area so I have no clue as to where to start in housing",

Georgetown people please help us newbies to make a decision around housing options (grad student dorm vs other options) \ud83d\ude4f Is it really too bad to travel from 55 H St to Georgetown main area? How much better is it living in other places? Thanks!!",

Alternatively, you could live farther out and take a either the Circulator or the G2 direct bus to the university. That said, I don't think the areas along those lines are much cheaper than Burleith. \n\nI wouldn't live in student housing. Knowing Georgetown, they're going to upcharge you (worth verifying though, since I'm not familiar with graduate residences).",

            "comment": "Hey! Fellow newly admitted SSP here. My partner and I went to the area this past week to look for housing. We have a cat so 55 H was not only out of our price range, it wasn\u2019t doable. We decided on a place out at Fairfax because the metro line goes to Rosslyn where the GUTS bus picks up. It is also a really nice neighborhood. You\u2019re probably going to have a commute any where you live because everything close is extremely expensive. Just be prepared for that and know what you are willing to compromise on. Love to chat more if you want! Feel free to message me :)\n\n(EDIT: We are moving in May when we graduate. You can only really find availability 2 months out from your move date.)",

            "comment": "My daughter rented a room in a dupont circle row house and we went to move her in last week only to find it was absolutely disgusting. Carpets had never been cleaned, kitchen overflowing with dishes in the sink and down the counter it was horrible. We ended up reserving a room at 55 H St. Not what we had planned until we discovered they had dropped their price from $1,826 to $1,500 utilities included, no deposit and it's brand new. It may not be the most convenient but almost every option is going to require a commute. Best thing about this one is the GUTS bus will drop you off at your apartment. She would have had to walk 2+ blocks in the dark had she stayed at dupont circle. Much safer and in the winter being dropped off at your doorstep is hard to beat.",

    "postText": "\nHey everyone! I\u2019m an international student who will soon be the first in my family to study in the US. My parents know that living expenses and such in the US are far more expensive. We\u2019re looking for a good estimate of how much we will be spending in total, including stuff like tuition, accommodation, food (which I know is on the website), but also expenses for stuff like going out, buying stuff to maintain your dorm, etc. For anyone willing to shell out the numbers, how much do you guys spend a year? How much should I expect to? I know this depends on personal fiscal habits, so I\u2019m looking to hear from a variety of perspectives. Thanks \ud83d\ude04",

Your personal income, your own spending habits (I don\u2019t like going out too much, so I don\u2019t have the same food and drink bill as the people that party at clubs day in day out), and where you live. That being said, expect to pay close to full tuition as an international student. I\u2019ve heard from a couple international students, and I hear that most of them do not get aid. I\u2019m an American, so I don\u2019t know how true that is, but I would assume you are paying the full tuition.",

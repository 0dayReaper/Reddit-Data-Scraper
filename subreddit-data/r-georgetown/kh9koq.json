And do you guys have any thoughts or advice on how to structure it/say in it? \n\nAdditionally, the deferral letter asks for my semester grades to be sent in when they\u2019re available. Does my counselor automatically get an email/link to do that or do I send them in myself? How do I proceed about doing that?\n\nAnd if you guys have any advice or any thoughts please tell me!\n\nThank you all and again please don\u2019t delete this lol",

            "comment": "Didn't have to write any LOCIs for college admissions (thank god), but had to write plenty for med schools (RIP), and here's my 2 cents:\n\nThere's really no trick to it. \n\nStart by briefly introducing yourself: \"I'm X and was just deferred blah blah blah...\"\n\nNext, plainly state the main point of the message: Either \"Georgetown is absolutely my top choice and I would attend without question if admitted\" or \"I am still very interested in attending Georgetown and would like to remain under consideration\" or whatever you want your message to be (obviously written in your own words and your own voice).\n\nFinally, give your reasoning: Explain why you want to attend Georgetown so much/more than other schools. Nothing crazy - a well-edited, succinct paragraph or two is probably sufficient here. If you've had any new developments (EC involvement, awards, etc.) since you submitted your app you can also include them here.\n\nI'm sure there a billion guides to how to do it online, but I wouldn't worry too much about the specifics. Just be genuine, humble, and show your excitement about Georgetown. Shoot me a PM if you have questions or want more detailed examples. \n\nAlso, just wanted to let you know I'm rooting for you. I truly hope you get into Georgetown, but if you don't, just know it will work out and you'll end up where you belong. I was convinced I was supposed to go to Yale, applied early, got deferred, then got rejected. Was super bummed for a while but looking back I can't imagine having gone anywhere other than Georgetown. Moral of the story: there are lots of great schools and you never really know what will be the best place for you. But again, hoping you get a nice Georgetown acceptance in the near future so you don't have to stress about that :)",

When I was accepted my counselor took her time with sending in my final transcripts and Georgetown did not like that. But since you got a deferral, don\u2019t give Georgetown any opportunity to get annoyed with you. \n\nRegarding a LOCI, I would highly recommend emailing some actual human contacts along with the guadmiss email. Google the Georgetown directory and find some contacts in admissions. Don\u2019t bombard, but an email to your regional/local admissions officer, an admissions contact you find on the directory, and the guadmiss will be more than enough. \n\nShort and sweet LOCI. Demonstrating interest is good, but try not to sound desperate or superficial. Inquire about anything you can do on YOUR END with regards to increasing your chances. (There\u2019s nothing you can do on your end, but it shows you\u2019re willing to work for what you want). Good luck.",

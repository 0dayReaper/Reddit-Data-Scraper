I have no idea why, but it's not uncommon for someone whose name is John to be referred to as Jack. My grandfather was named John, but was often referred to as Jack. Same with JFK. He was often called Jack Kennedy. i don't think it goes both ways though. If you are named Jack, I don't think people will call you John.",

    "postText": "I am planning on taking organic chemistry over the summer at Georgetown and it is probably going to be online once again. I was wondering how it was like taking Orgo1+2 Lecture and Lab with Oscar Zimmerman in the summer. What was your daily schedule like and what did you think of the experience? What should I do to really prepare for this class since it will be very intense and fast-paced?",

            "comment": "I would strongly recommend against taking both sections of orgo in one semester, or, for that matter, during one summer. Orgo is notoriously difficult. If you think you can handle the intensity, or you need it as some sort of requirement to graduate, go ahead. However I\u2019m also curious if it would be beneficial to take orgo 2 without having taken orgo 1 previously.\n\nAs for the schedule, unless someone else responds with their experience, you can find a class schedule from previous summers on myaccess, if there is not one already up for summer 2021",

            "comment": "I took Orgo 1 and 2 lectures over the summer with Zimmerman pre-Covid and it was not the best experience. You have class five days a week (it might have been four if I'm confusing it with the lab) and you go over a chapter a day. You have a test every week over the chapters you went over the week before. He goes quickly through the material and sometimes what he says is unclear, but he is available every day for office hours and is more helpful then. If you have the time to dedicate to Orgo for two months, then you can do it, but it won't be easy. I also took the lab during those two months. You have to write two full lab reports every week, which can be time-consuming. The labs were long, too. I was lucky to have great TAs both months who were helpful with questions and clearly pointing out where lab reports can be improved. To prepare for the class, I would expose myself to the functional units and nomenclature/naming of compounds. Zimmerman tested a lot on that. Also! Zimmerman provides practice exams from past years which he bases some of the questions off  (maybe 50%...the other half being questions from the textbook practice Q's). In my experience, the final exam is primarily a mixture of the exams he gives you. \n\nMy response is kinda jumbled, but feel free to ask me anything else :)",

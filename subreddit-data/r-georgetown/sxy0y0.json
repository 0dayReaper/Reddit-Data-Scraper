            "comment": "Extensions mean nothing, buyout clauses and the costs associated with them do and that will never be made public. From what I\u2019m hearing he doesn\u2019t exactly want to step down but there are also some conflicting opinions on this so your guess is as good as mine. I\u2019ve been going back and forth on this but I\u2019d say it\u2019s 60/40 on him staying. Of course my opinion doesn\u2019t mean anything, though. \n\nIf he does step down, then the administration has a huge task of finding the right coach. They have two options here. First find a young coach who can inject some energy into the program. Something like what Shaka Smart is doing at Marquette. This kind of move would have an extremely high ceiling but also a low floor. In my opinion the name to look out for is Dennis Gates at Cleveland State - it would be a massive jump for him but Lee Reed has ties to Cleveland State and we\u2019ve clearly taken risks before. The other option is to go for an older, established guy who will cost a boatload of money. Think of this as more of a higher floor, lower ceiling kind of move. Right now Steve Forbes at Wake Forest is my top choice but you will have to PAY for him. If  any of this does happen, we NEED to move away from the Thompson era. We can embrace history without trying to live in it, but this would be the official start to a new era of Georgetown Basketball so we\u2019d have to treat it as such. Tbh I don\u2019t think DeGioia has it in him though\u2026\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t step down, which again is a very likely possibility, he MUST rework his staff in some way. Replace Louis Orr, Kirby, and Waheed. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re great guys but something needs to change because clearly it\u2019s not working. The only person I\u2019d keep is Crouch because hes a boy but right now he isn\u2019t even a coach. Bring in some new faces, some young X\u2019s and O\u2019s guys and someone who knows how to build a program, not just coach. It is not far fetched to sayPatrick Ewing knows how to coach and develop players, but he definitely does not how to manage a college program and that\u2019s what\u2019s led to the lack continuity among his best players. Look for a Phil Martelli at Michigan type of coach who has had success elsewhere in college as a head coach and was then brought on to Juwan Howard\u2019s staff to be the lead assistant and manager of sorts. Sadly I don\u2019t see this happening because since when does Georgetown make the right decisions? but if he doesn\u2019t step down this is the only way we truly see progress. \n\nEither way shit must change because we suck. We can get out of this with or without Pat, but if it doesn\u2019t change, we will always suck. We\u2019re a soccer school I guess.\n\nBy the way I\u2019m not some HoyaTalk bullshitter. This is a quasi-connected student who is just going off of conversations with people who actually know a thing or two around here. I want to make that extremely clear.",

I'm told the feeling within athletics is that Ewing is safe, but some of those washed up assistant coaches making $1 million+ per year are gonna have to go.",

I especially like the way your statement addressed Coach Ewing's inability to run a program. Change of some kind has to happen otherwise this terrible situation turns into insanity and could cripple the Hoya Brand long-term.",

            "comment": "Ewing\u2019s problem is continuity. I think he asks his players to play complex systems that take a long time to fully click and can go out as soon as one guy over rotates/hedges/takes a mistimed breath on defense. Asking college players to implement it was always going to be a stretch, but asking a team of new guys and underclassmen every year to master this thing is too much. Transfers are up generally but nowhere more than Georgetown, and they\u2019d never break Hoya paranoia to give any clues why it\u2019s been so serious year after year. If he keeps this team together (besides graduates and maybe Mohammed to the draft) they will be much improved. Which isn\u2019t saying much by the wins and losses this year, I know. \n\nI don\u2019t think they ever fire Ewing but some transfers could prompt them to secure his resignation, like with JT III after tremont waters decommitted. I also think fans are probably way more convinced that it\u2019s time for a parting of ways than the administration is.",

    "postText": "For context, I transferred as a junior and my order of courses at my old school is different from Georgetown\u2019s progression\n\nI am trying to take 2 OPIM courses (241,242) this spring but both require OPIM 220 as a prerequisite. I have credit for 230 (which also requires 220 at Georgetown) from my old school.\n\nBecause of the Georgetown sequencing, I was unable to take OPIM 220 this fall and would ideally be taking it concurrently with 241,242 this spring. \n\nUnfortunately my dean wont make any exceptions for this and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any way I would be able to take a prerequisite concurrently. I know I am able to handle taking them concurrently but just need to figure out how I can.",

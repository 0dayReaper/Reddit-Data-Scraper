Here's what some reverse image searching came up with:\n\n&gt; Present site: White Gravenor Hall, Copley Lawn\n\n&gt; 37th and 0 Streets, N.W.\n\n&gt; Opened: ~1870\n\n&gt; Closed: 1893\n\n&gt; Turf: Grass\n\n&gt; Capacity: ~1,000\n\n&gt; Largest Crowd: Unknown\n\n&gt; The first two seasons of Georgetown varsity football do not list any home field; it can be presumed that games were held on campus but the game accounts located do not, as yet, confirm this. Games were confirmed at the old college baseball field (which lacked permanent seating) in the 1889 and 1890 seasons. The field was eventually razed to construct the \"new\" Georgetown Field in 1894.

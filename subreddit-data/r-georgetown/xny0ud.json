ANYTHING that Georgetown is remotely trying to improve \n\nSorry but Its a genuine, please forgive me, if in any ways it offended you. I have greatest of the respect for the institutions and what they are doing. \n\nAgain, I was just curious, In no way, I am trying to do ANYTHING remote to offending anyone.",

No place is perfect, and a lot of the \u2018weaknesses\u2019 are a side effect of some of Georgetown\u2019s biggest strengths.",

I'm politically active in one of the two parties but had no trouble making friends across the political spectrum (although of course there are more Ds than Rs on the whole)",

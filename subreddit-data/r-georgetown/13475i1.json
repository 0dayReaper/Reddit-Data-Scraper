            "comment": "Honestly, if you're a grad student and will not be in the undergrad or grad student housing, or in a student dorm and as such have access to a kitchen and such, which I presume you will, meal planning is cheaper. The university food is overpriced and not that good honestly. \n\nLike get a friend that has a Cosco membership and a car and do a shopping trip and stock up for cheap, Trader Joes is a great option, and most grad student centers have a fridge, and microwave so bring lunch, and a coffee/tea machine with creamers and shit.\n\nI can send you some cheap and easy nutritious meals depending on your dietary preferences. \n\nRent is expensive but you can save on food if you are willing to meal plan or cook yourself, and as I said if you're not in a dorm and have a kitchen, it's the better option.",

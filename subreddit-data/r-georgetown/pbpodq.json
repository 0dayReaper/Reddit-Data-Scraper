    "postText": "So, I am a nondenominational christian at georgetown and am a bit confused at where I fit in. Obviously there are many catholic services as well as orthodox christian and Protestant events. I am none of those and I feel awkward trying to participate in those events, almost feeling a bit fraudulent about my faith because how I practice is different than them. Are there any nondenominational groups on campus? How did other nondenominational christians explore their faith and practice fellowship on campus? To be honest, I'm used to casual churches with jeans and coffee. I don't really know how to act around other, more \"formal\" types of christian.",

That said, I found a church off campus that I enjoyed attending and caught the bus there many Sundays. I\u2019m sure you will be able to find your place - on or off campus!",

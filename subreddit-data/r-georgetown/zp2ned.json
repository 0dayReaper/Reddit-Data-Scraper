    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI am a high school senior applying to Georgetown for the fall of 2023. I would like to submit an optional teacher report, but this teacher now teaches at a different high school, holds a different position, and thus has a different school email. When filling out her contact information, should I write her old position pertaining to my high school, or should I use her current position? If the latter, is there any place in my application where I am expected to explain the difference in high school name?\n\nTIA :)",

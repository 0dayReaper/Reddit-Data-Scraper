            "comment": "-Not that catholic (but significant community if you search them out) \n- Most people are not very religious/conservative, it\u2019s less liberal than your average college campus but still not conservative by any means\n- People try very hard and are competitive in terms of trying to rack up accomplishments for themselves, but no one tries to tear others down and people cooperate in classes\n- Big gov/business/humanities/social sciences vibe on campus, few students are pure STEM or creative arts majors\n- Professors are overwhelmingly approachable and care about their classes and students, a few less so but generally they are great\n- Clubs are very big on campus especially sophomore and junior year, they can suck up a lot of time but there\u2019s cool stuff going on and a good way to meet people. Many clubs but the most prominent are the newspapers, pre-professional business clubs, the student-run business on campus called the Corp, and student government. \n- Sports are very separate from the rest of campus, they have their own little cliques but don\u2019t dominate anything. Most students don\u2019t care much about sports, even basketball\n- Greek life is tiny and unofficial, few people care\n- Living in DC is awesome, Georgetown is a beautiful and exciting neighborhood that is easily walkable, and catching an uber/the bus to the rest of the city is pretty easy too. Only bad thing is the price of transportation, housing and food especially are quite expensive if you go off campus\n- Overall, students are ambitious and care about their work, extracurriculars and career, people really like to have fun and most people are extroverted/social but are too busy to care about greek life/sports and instead focus on hanging out with their friends. It\u2019s honestly great, pushes you to keep active and be ambitious but everyone tries to have a good time and keep an active social life at the same time.",

From my experience, parties aren\u2019t as big or frequent (we still go off during Homecoming, St Patty\u2019s, and Georgetown Day) and people tend to study more but the party scene is still pretty good if you know where to go.",

            "comment": "Most of the time, Georgetown does not feel all that Catholic, you'll only remember when you happen to see the wooden crosses in certain classrooms or when it comes time for Easter break. If you want Catholic you can find it but otherwise it's almost a non-factor.\n\nDC is a great place to go to school and there are lots of social and professional opportunities. What's nice about Georgetown is you do have a true college campus, but you also have the city right there next to it, so in that sense it's the best of both worlds.\n\nGeorgetown is high-achieving, but it is much more of a collaborative community than a competitive one. Students will help each other get where they want to be, professionally and academically.\n\nSocial life is what you make of it, most people will party on weekends but not weekdays, and especially for underclassmen the social scene is more oriented toward being on campus, although there are some groups of people who will go out in DC if that's what you're looking for. Clubs in some ways serve the role that frats otherwise would of creating larger social communities, and pretty much every club has some alcoholic and/or sober social component.\n\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean by faculty relations, but while you may not have the natural bond with professors you would at a small liberal arts college, if you want to get to your professors you can 95% of your time. Overall most professors are good but there is a mixture of true star teachers and others who just get the job done.\n\nOverall Georgetown is a place where it feels like nearly anything is possible if you want it and try hard enough. There is a strong and supportive campus community, and while there are certainly sub-groups the school is small enough that you will run into people multiple places and there's a lot of overlap between those groups.",

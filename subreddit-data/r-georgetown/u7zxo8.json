If you don\u2019t want to party, there are plenty of ways to have friends and fun without partying. The neighborhood of Georgetown will not have the same college town vibes of Ann Arbor as it\u2019s very residential; however, there are plenty of parties on campus or off campus in townhouses every weekend.",

The first month or two has lots of parties which are more open to anyone who hears about them, but after a while, most of them are dependent upon whether or not a particular club/society wants to hold them(and some of these tend to have entrance fees as well. The main exception is Vil A which has parties anytime for anyone who can get in, as well as smaller parties that go on in your dorm. Overall, it all depends on how good your network of friends is to discover these parties\u2014they\u2019re everywhere, you just have to know where to be and when.",

    "postText": "I was accepted to do my MA in the department of government last March however because of financial reasons I had to defer my acceptance for 2023. \n\nI wanted to know is it worth it? I will be an international student from Canada and the price tag on the degree is a lot compared to my MA degree in doing rn in Canada which is free. What are you thoughts in it and is it really worth it (eg will I find a job after?) thanks \ud83d\ude2d",

Everybody\u2019s worried about whether they can find a job, but my sense is you can network and intern while in your MA program and set yourself up for one.",

You are right, the network opportunities at Georgetown compared to my uni in Canada are not even comparable,  mainly cause of the location! However thx so much for you advice",

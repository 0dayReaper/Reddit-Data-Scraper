            "comment": "SFS students, like any other GU students, apply for and get almost every type of internship you can imagine. Government (Capitol Hill or government agency/department), finance/banking, and consulting internships are some of the most talked about but that doesn\u2019t make them the best, and you can intern with pretty much any form of government, nonprofit, or business you can imagine. \n\nPretty much every internship is at least slightly competitive, but the degree of competitiveness varies. Yes, you will have formal guidance from the career centers and informal guidance from older students and alumni who have applied for and gotten similar internships in the past.",

I've done Capitol Hill twice (both House and Senate; tbh not that hard to get especially if the member is from your state/district because they give their constituents a preference). I've interned with DOJ as well as a nonprofit. Getting internships is pretty easy, the harder thing is finding one that is paid.",

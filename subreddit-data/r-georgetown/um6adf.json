With hard languages you\u2019ll be taking 6 credit classes (3 credits is normal) for at least 2-3 years and doing hours of homework per night, but you\u2019ll learn a valuable language that\u2019s especially useful if you want to do foreign service/intel work. Don\u2019t underestimate the difficulty but if you are fully committed to putting in the effort it can be worth it. \n\nWhereas knowing Latin, learning a Romance language would be more of a breeze. Having the Latin background also makes this fall back plan easier if you start with a hard language.\n\nAs for the specifics, choose languages from places you are interested in learning about, but also just what seems fun!",

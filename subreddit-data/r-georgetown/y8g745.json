            "comment": "when i toured georgetown, my tour guide was on the premed track and specifically emphasized how Georgetown profs are especially open to undergrads doing research (my tour guide herself was doing cancer research at the georgetown medical school nearby) and how there's so many federal agencies in the DC area who provide stem internships, etc (ex: national institute of health, etc). also the early-assurance program for georgetown school of medicine, which is offered to undergrads/premeds at georgetown and she said something about skipping the mcat or whatever. honesty just do ur research, it seems like georgetown has lots of opportunities for premeds even tho it has the reputation of being a humanities/politics/etc-focused school!!! good luckkk",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t really speak for psych or bioC, but as a pre-med student I would say it depends on the course and the professor. General chemistry was especially tough for a bunch of people for the first exam but that might have just been a scare tactic to weed out some people. And I wouldn\u2019t say there has been any grade inflation or deflation for any of the pre-med classes I\u2019ve had so far. There isn\u2019t a ranked grading system where only a few people can get A\u2019s. However, I would say the classes are generally tough so it may be more difficult just to maintain a high grade simply from the amount of content you cover.",

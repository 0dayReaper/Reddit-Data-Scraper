    "postText": "Hi Everyone, \n\nI am a student at UNC-Chapel Hill, and I am interning in Georgetown this summer! I am interested in finding a potential sublet rather than living in a dorm for the summer. I don't really know anyone in the area, so I would love any input on where to look for sublets (besides the Facebook groups), if someone is in need of one, and recommendations on which of the dorms (Vil A, Nevils, and Alumni) is best for someone who hasn't lived in a dorm in two years. Thank you all for your help, Go Hoyas!",

Sublets, the best way is honestly just word of mouth, so ask anyone you know with a Georgetown connection.",

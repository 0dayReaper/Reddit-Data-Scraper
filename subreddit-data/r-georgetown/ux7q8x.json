    "postText": "I am starting my PhD at Georgetown this fall and am thinking of creating a new bank account (I currently use a regional account, so I can't withdraw cash from ATMs without paying a transactional fee).\n\nI am thinking of living in the Arlington/Rosslyn area. Please let me know if you have any suggestions for good brick and mortar banks in this area. \nI'm not the biggest fan of national banks, but none of the regional/local banks stand out to me either. Should I join a credit union instead? Any banks specifically beneficial for Georgetown students? Thanks in advance!",

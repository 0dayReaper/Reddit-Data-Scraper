Pretty much no one is going to care that you're a transfer--once you're there, you're there and we're all Hoyas.\n\nFrom a classes/credits perspective, what I would recommend is really comparing what you've taking to the degree requirements. Some classes (say Intro to International Relations) are going to be pretty common and will easily transfer 1:1. For some others, you may have to have a meeting to get the credit applied to your major or to show it satisfied a requirement for your major. For example, I was a gov major and had to meet with some counselor or assistant dean to show them how a few of my political science classes matched up with a few Georgetown Govt. required classes because it wasn't necessarily intuitive from the name.",

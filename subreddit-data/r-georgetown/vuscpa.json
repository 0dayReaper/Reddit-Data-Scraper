    "postText": "Hi Hoyas! Incoming freshman here, new to this subreddit. I'm entering as an SFS student, but have a feeling that might change after first year. I was originally admitted to the College undeclared, then made an impulsive decision to make a school change request to the SFS and was approved (not gonna lie, the perception of prestige influenced this decision). I'm definitely interested in economics &amp; politics (though I hate Model UN with a passion, it has always felt like a popularity contest and a bunch of talk w/o action to me). I also like science, but didn't have relevant high school extracurriculars, so didn't apply as a science major. This summer, I've been doing some soul-searching about my eventual career. Medicine seems like a straightforward (albeit long) path that I know well having a parent who's a physician, while the careers that SFS typically leads to (consulting, ibanking) seem more vague and unknown to me. \n\nMy question is, how feasible is being pre-med while in the SFS (majoring in STIA)? I've heard it's been done, but it's difficult. I'm already finding that it's almost impossible to fit the usual premed first-year courses into an SFS schedule. I'm presumably taking Prosem, Map, Problem of God, Econ, and a foreign language. That leaves incredibly tight room for a lab science. But I'll have to choose between Gen Chem and Foundations of Bio. If I do Bio, I won't have the prereq for Orgo next year. And if I do Chem, I won't be able to get acquainted with the Bio department until later, thus limiting research opportunities. It's all making my head spin a bit, so any advice/thoughts would be appreciated! \n\nOn another note, can being in the SFS and disliking Model UN be reconciled? If the SFS is mainly ambitious MUN kids, I don't know how well I'll fit in.\n\ntldr: am I crazy for attempting SFS + premed? Should I just run to the College as soon as humanly possible (likely not until after freshman year though)? Or is there something truly special about SFS?  \n\nIn the College, btw, I'm eyeing Biology of Global Health. Is it possible to switch into that major in soph year despite not starting out as a Bio major?",

            "comment": "Hey there,\n\nFinished undergraduate a few years back, but the advice should still be timely enough.\n\nI have a good friend who did Pre-Med/STIA, so I didn't experience it directly. I will say this friend of mine is probably the hardest working person I know, so keep that in mind.\n\nThe double SFS/Pre-Med path is doable, but it will require a lot of work. My recommendation would be to open a discussion with your Dean/Academic Advisor if this is something you're really interested in. That will be the best person to work with to design your schedule and to mitigate potential problems down the line.\n\nThat said, I don't think you should have too much of an issue switching back to the college if you wanted to go the traditional Pre-Med path. But that will definitely require working with the Dean's office.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you. I know people who majored in non-science classes and either did postbacks before med school, or their med school offered the foundational science courses itself for non-pre-med students; and I know people who were Pre-Med their entire undergraduate career and then never went to med school.\n\nKeep in mind: you don't need to design your entire life before your freshman year. You'll have flexibility for a little while in regards to all the important stuff. Talk with your Dean, talk with your family/friends, and then carve out whichever path you're most comfortable with. \n\nBest of luck, and of course: Hoya Saxa!",

It's about engaging in conversation with folks you trust and determining what would be the best option for you overall.\n\nAnd yes, my friend did go to Med School! He just graduated a year or two back.",

You should only be in the SFS if you\u2019re genuinely interested in most of the material and OK with the core (IR, history, government, econ, etc). I will say, though, that you can definitely be in the SFS without being part of the MUN squad. \n\nI know a few pre-med SFS people. Anecdotally, I know that a few of them regretted the SFS as it didn\u2019t help with their GPA (which is really important for med schools) nor contribute to their overall academic goals. If you can offset the cons, though (as in, you believe you will not be sacrificing your GPA too much and you genuinely are interested in the intersection between global affairs and medicine), then I think it\u2019s a valid path to pursue.",

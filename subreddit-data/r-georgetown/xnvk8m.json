    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m a current first year at a mid-tier UC and I\u2019m going to apply to Georgetown when the application opens up for Fall 2023.\n\nWondering if anyone in a similar position has any tips or advice for me? Ideally I\u2019m applying to SFS\u2014but to me getting into Georgetown as a whole is more important than getting into any specific program cause I really love the school (applied in high school too, got waitlisted). I really like Econ but I\u2019m currently a microbio major, so I don\u2019t really have space to add Econ classes\u2026",

I'm a veteran and threw in a letter of recommendation from one of my former commanders, even though you're not supposed too. :)  \nHere's my advice:\n\nMy best advice, is be detailed on your application, be creative on your application letter -- talk about who YOU ARE and how that makes you a solid citizen and future alumni.  Don't just write about your accomplishments -- 4.0 student, AP classes, sports, volunteer work..etch....blah, blah, blah.  Every application has that and it's repetitive -- I'm not saying downplay those, just don't make it your focus.  Also, state somewhere WHY you chose G-town and why it fits you the most.  \n\n\nBest of luck.",

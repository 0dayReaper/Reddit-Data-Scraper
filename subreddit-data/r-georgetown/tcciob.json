    "postText": "Just received an admission letter from Georgetown\u2019s Communication, Culture, Technology program and wanted to hear about students\u2019 general experiences &amp; non-academic career outcomes in the program. I\u2019ve read the stories on the CCT website, but I\u2019d really be grateful to hear more, especially from people currently in the program or recent alums.\n\nI am also interested to learn about the new graduate housing (and what should be my steps to secure affordable and quality housing with other people? I don\u2019t have anyone in DC or don\u2019t know anyone in the program) and whether the program is implementing online or offline instruction format now &amp; going forward. \n\nThank you so much in advance, I am an international student, so I\u2019m sorry if these sound like dumb questions \ud83d\ude43 and yes, I\u2019m going to contact the current students directly too.",

Overall it was probably my favorite class last semester.",

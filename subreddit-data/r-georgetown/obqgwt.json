    "postText": "As a freshman student, I am currently trying to decide if I should register for a freshman seminar. I was wondering if anybody has taken a freshman seminar and if so what was your experience? Would you recommend\u00a0it to someone who plans on double majoring in Global Health of Biology and International Business? I am only asking this because I am worried that it will be a waste of a class that won't help me fulfill\u00a0my requirements and that it will make it harder for me to pick my classes since students have to schedule around their freshman seminar.",

            "comment": "Do you mean Biology of Global Health (in the College) or Global Health (in the NHS)? And what school is International Business in? Because you cannot double major across schools.\n\nI did not take a freshman seminar, and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. The people I know who took them ended up doing 10x the amount of work that should have been required of them and for very little benefit (if any at all).",

But ik plenty of people who didnt take a FYS and they were fine, it depends on if you\u2019re interested in the subject enough to take it, plus you can always drop within the add/drop period.",

    "postText": "Hey all. I\u2019m a freshman in the MSB and I\u2019m wondering about what I should do next summer before sophomore year. I\u2019ve been trying to find internships but every single place I reached out has either rejected me or failed to respond. Is this normal and will this set me back in terms of recruitment? My resume is basically blank since it has nothing but my part time job at gtown law. I know this is not Wall Street Oasis, but I\u2019d like to see a few Hoya perspectives.",

            "comment": "Look at smaller companies or organizations that might just hire an intern or two instead of a whole formalized program targeted mostly at juniors who can accept a job the next year. They tend to be more flexible and willing to give people who are passionate but less \"experienced\" a chance. And, if things are less rigid, they may give you more high-level work to do if you're good. Many of these won't be posted/hiring until the spring anyway because, unlike larger companies/orgs, they can't predict their hiring needs nearly a year in advance.",

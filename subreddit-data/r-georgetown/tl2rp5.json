    "postText": "Hi all, I'm planning on turning in my app to the MURP program this week and I'm super pumped about it. However, I've been having a hard time figuring out the requirements of the program. A lot of other universities will list things like \"400 internship hours with X type of company\" or \"group project with other students doing XYZ in the second year\" (just laying out the specifics) on the curriculum or program requirements website pages, but Georgetown doesn't really do that. It hints at what the program includes but is pretty vague. Any current or affiliated students know anything about the program with relation to that?",

Through a combination of academic theory and applied studio work, you\u2019ll develop the skills and analytic insights needed for success in the urban planning industry.\"  \n\"In the classroom, you\u2019ll learn from scholars and practitioners, who introduce the tools and methods associated with complex urban analysis. In the field, you'll have opportunities to apply our skills through urban studios, international travel, independent research, and professional networking.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yea, kinda tells a bit but also not really? lol\n\nI just want to make sure I'm applying to a program that's aligned with that I want for my masters education!",

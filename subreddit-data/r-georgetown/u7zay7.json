    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI had a question about intro to Econ Principles Micro ECON-001-10. I am interested in taking the microeconomics class. Has anyone taken the Intro to Microeconomics class that is offered over the summer? What was your experience of it considering it is a semester worth of content in a month? Was the work load manageable?\n\nFor those who have taken the regular class during the semester what has your experience been? How intense was the class and any particular standout professors that you found helpful?\n\nThanks so much for the help!",

Yes it\u2019s manageable over the summer, probably one of the more manageable summer classes in fact because there\u2019s not really any reading.\n\nThe regular class is going to be a mega lecture with optional discussion sections as opposed to the summer small class environment. There\u2019s only one prof per semester so you don\u2019t really get to choose.",

It\u2019s a pretty laidback class, with optional zoom meetings(which I highly recommend not skipping) and optional recitations(very helpful for midterms and confusing problem sets). Homework was less than 1.5 hours weekly, but midterms were definitely much harder. The class was taught really well; I just wish there wasn\u2019t a sudden spike in difficulty when it came to exams",

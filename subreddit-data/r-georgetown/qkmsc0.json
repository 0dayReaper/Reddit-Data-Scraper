There aren\u2019t a lot of rangers with hundreds of people because there are no houses that large. Also it\u2019s true that many (not all) parties have a lot more talking than dancing. No it\u2019s not a party school but if you want to go to parties they will be there.",

                            "comment": "I'm bored in a painfully boring class, so here's my input as a senior:\n\nLike the other posters, most parties are hosted by student organizations or student's birthday parties.  The parties are small/medium sized, except for Homecoming and Georgetown day (last Friday of classes in spring semester), where Georgetown turns into a state school for the day.   A lot of freshman guys have a tough time because a lot of parties only let in people who are in their club/friend group, and nobody wants a bunch of random guys at the house.  But as a senior guy, between the bars and the clubs I'm in, I have no shortage of things to do, albeit it is nothing like the state school \"frat house\" experience.\n\nA lot of students go out to clubs in DC (18+ clubs like Decades or Ultra for underclassmen) or use a fake to get into other bars (although majority of people don't have fakes).  \n\nOne thing I will add is that social life shifts as you get older, in that 21+ students often go out to bars in Georgetown (Tombs comes to mind) or in DC (Adam's Morgan and Dupont Circle are pretty hopping Friday/Saturday night with Georgetown/GW/American/Howard students and other young adults).\n\n**In summary/TLDR:**  \nGeorgetown lacks the state school \"frat house\" vibe; most of the parties are small/medium sized and hosted primarily by clubs on campus.  However, the DC location makes up for this due to the relevance of clubs and bars, which is amplified as you become an upperclassmen.",

    "postText": "I am a transfer student starting my 2nd semester in the College this fall, and my core language requirement is the only one left to complete.  I am considering minoring in Modern Greek since I have been speaking Greek since childhood (though I suck) , and I will start with Intensive 1st Level Modern Greek 1. It's a 5 credit course so I'm wondering would it be too much mental strain to do 4 other courses if they are all 3 credits? Should I just sign up for everything else (Government major requirements and electives) and drop a class if necessary? I know this is subjective for everyone but what have your experiences been with intensive language classes? I appreciate your advice! (-:",

Having some background in the language will undoubtedly help you, though.\n\nAs you allude, you can always adjust accordingly during add/drop or even withdraw (note: there is  a deadline if you want a full or partial refund).",

            "comment": "It's not impossible, but they are daily work and it can be non-trivial. I don't know how Modern Greek (especially for a heritage speaker, I assume) would compare to, say, Arabic or Chinese, which are intensive languages I know people have found rather demanding.\n\nIf I were in your shoes as a transfer, I'd consider dropping down to the intensive language at 5 credits plus 3 other courses. If you feel like it goes well in the fall, then bump up to four courses plus a level 2 intensive language in the spring. It's better to ace fewer courses and feel in control than to take a heavier load and feel like you're scrambling in your first semester. (I experienced and regret the latter!)\n\nIf you're motivated to do the four courses plus intensive language in the fall to get through a few extra credits in a year, consider adding a compacted summer course (like a pre-session course) after the spring semester. You'll get the same credit over the year, but with less risk of getting stretched too thin.",

But it is double the time in class. So if you would rather not have to do 3 more hours in classrooms, I'd take three other classes instead of four. But it is doable to take four in additional, mostly the difference is just more time in classroom space.",

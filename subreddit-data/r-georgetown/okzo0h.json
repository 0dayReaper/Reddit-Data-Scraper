    "postText": "For the past year I have enjoyed jogging Georgetown campus at ALLLLLLL hours of the day and night without having to maneuver through crowds of students. \n\nI\u2019m wondering how much more time I have until students begin to become a regular thing in and around the campus? I just jogged there a few hours ago and sure there are more ppl around the university hospital roundabout and the bookstore than there were a year ago but I know it\u2019s gonna be nothing compared to once the university is back up and running at 1000%. Honestly I\u2019ve even enjoyed being able to park my car closer to the campus with ease. Just wondering when all that is considered normal is suppose to begin. \n\n(Like for example I am completely avoiding Disneyland now seeing how packed it is)",

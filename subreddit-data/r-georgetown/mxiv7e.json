They are CEO\u2019s, lawyers, business  executives: all people who are teaching us real business skills. You will see in a lot of programs that the professors are just academics. Though a lot of classes are online I feel extremely connected not only to my class, but the school. Also the program has really great job placement. 10/10 would recommend! Let me know if you have any other questions",

I am curious whether or not it is possible to work full time while taking classes, the videos about Georgetown SCS say the courses are in the evening which is good, are they asynchronous? Sorry for all the questions haha",

            "comment": "I know some of my friends who moved from the West Coast to the East Coast were surprised by preppiness and/or the level of put-togetherness in the way that people dress. But that's not too big of a deal and you can dress however you want to of course. \n\nGeorgetown is a pretty respectable and respected name, so a lot of what you're paying for in the tuition is the benefits that that name may or may not bring to you in your job search. They usually do a pretty good job at recruiting an interesting combination of people, so your classmates will probably be interesting and may become close colleagues. \n\nThere's a decent smattering of alumni benefits which I guess you'll find out more about when you get closer to that point. Things like discounts on certain kinds of car insurance, or membership to certain kinds of alumni clubs (for example, the Cornell Club of New York City used to be one of them; I haven't looked recently at what the offerings are out west).\n\nOverall it's a great school, so if you look at your life and your budget and you think the investment of the tuition is worth it, then go for it. Bioinformatics especially is one of the more financially lucrative career paths, so you're probably not in too much danger of being trapped by debt. There's a hospital on campus, which means there's probably some level of opportunity for interning or collaborating with medical professionals there.\n\nIt is just a school, and no school is perfect, so keep that in mind. I know on TikTok recently I saw there were a bunch of student protests earlier this month about something having to do with race on campus. I don't know how much that stuff would really affect you at a graduate level.\n\nGood luck, and Hoya Saxa.",

            "comment": "as someone living there, i like it so far! i would recommend still looking around to see if you can find a better deal, but i think it\u2019s worth it! i really enjoy having the bus that goes directly from the apartment to campus. \n\ni will warn that i do find the area to be a bit sketchy (people on the dc subreddit complain about the walmart that\u2019s located at the other end of the block), but overall it\u2019s fine. they added a shuttle that will take you to a few key places nearby the apartment, like union station, which is super convenient. there\u2019s a few grocery stores nearby, and others are pretty easily accessible via bus or metro. \n\nif you have any more questions, feel free to message me!",

            "comment": "A friend in my grad program is living there this year but isn't going to live there again next year. She said it would be better for someone who is a recent undergraduate grad, but if you're a little older it's not as ideal and is expensive. But she said the bus is convenient and it's a good location if you want to be more in the city and not tucked away in Georgetown. I live north of Georgetown in Glover Park which is a quiet neighborhood where you can find reasonable rent if you have roomates",

Is it due to long walking distances? I'm considering living in this housing or going to Georgetown. But its, being tucked away there in Georgetown, leaves you out of networking events and job opportunities nearby (?)",

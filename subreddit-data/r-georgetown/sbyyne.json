    "postText": "I was just admitted to the online MS in Business Analytics. I\u2019m very likely going to attend, mainly because I\u2019m based in DC and they have a couple of in-person residencies throughout the program. Anyone else here admitted or a prospective student? Would love to make some connections ahead of the program starting.",

If you can't compromise, then I would get in touch with your RF. I definitely know that housing admins will move students under certain conditions, I've heard at least three stories of people being moved around. All of the rooms here aren't occupied, I think this is especially true for female suites.",

Whenever it's late and someone is loud, we just ask them to quiet down/if they could move to the floor common area. Although it's never been a problem where people were inside of their bedrooms and noisy.\n\nOverall, I like the rooms. The bedrooms are sufficiently large for my taste, I don't have a lot of extra things nor do I decorate because I don't care. The common area/kitchen is good too, I feel like my suite has been lucky in comparison to others because we haven't had any appliance issues (which I heard has especially been a problem on the lower floors). The only complaint I guess is that you can hear everything in the common area from the bedroom (but somehow the bedrooms next to each other are mostly soundproof).",

I got A/A- In the pre med classes I took (ended up switching out of it), and I never thought it was unfair. Almost everyone I know who works hard and is good at the subject will end up in med school.\n\nAnd if you struggle to get a B in intro chem, I wouldn\u2019t want you as my doctor lol. So there\u2019s a reason premed isn\u2019t easy.",

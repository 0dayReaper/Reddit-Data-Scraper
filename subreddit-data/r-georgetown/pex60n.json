    "postText": "I'm a second-year grad student but spent the first year abroad doing online classes due to Covid so only just came to the university physically. As a grad student, I'm a bit disconnected from campus culture, but I'm very curious about university lore - what are some cool/weird/funny/traditional/otherwise interesting practices/stories/myths/rituals/whatever else that exist at GU? I'm not that interested in the official university-sanctioned history, but more so what goes down between students.",

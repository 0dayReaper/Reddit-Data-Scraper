    "postText": "How safe is Georgetown, especially after dark? Is it safe for a female to walk to/from class alone for graduate night classes? \n\nVisited the town today and there was a creepy guy following me and my mom on Wisconsin Ave near O st and it was 11 am broad daylight. We walked into compass coffee to get away and he waited outside the cafe but eventually walked away. Long hair and bearded dude\n\nThinking I may have to Uber to night classes if I end up committing to this grad program at GU.",

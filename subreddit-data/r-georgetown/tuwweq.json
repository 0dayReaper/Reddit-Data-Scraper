The only real crime is the occasional theft, and in the emails GUPD sends reporting those, there is inevitably a line saying \"there were no signs of forced entry,\" which means someone didn't lock their house or office.  In other words, the campus and neighborhood is so safe that the only source of crime is people being so so confident in the safety of the area.  Lock your door and you're fine.",

It\u2019s isolated by the quiet Georgetown from downtown. \n\nThe police are very active patrolling and are hiring up their force. \n\nYou can view crime logs on the GUPD website. \n\nWith health, there\u2019s on campus EMS and hospital. The free covid testing is genuinely great with tests in 5 min and same day results.",

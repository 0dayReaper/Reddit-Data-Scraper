The humanities just publish less research papers, and those research papers contain less cross-reference than science-based ones. Those factors both impact the ranking.\n\nThe reality is that as an adult people come to their own determination about school quality. I don\u2019t think anyone would reasonably hold Geoegetown in lower regard than Vanderbilt. WashU is on the same level as Georgetown.\n\nThe second layer of truth to this is that smart and dumb people graduate from every school, and the name on your degree is about as important as determining your intelligence as what you had for breakfast",

If you are referring to Georgetown\u2019s ranking relative to the Ivy League Schools, or MIT/Chicago/Stanford, then there is no ambiguity because that\u2019s simply how good Georgetown is relative to those schools. \n\nGeorgetown is roughly on par with the lower ranked Ivy League schools Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth and UPenn (not counting Wharton) for undergrad, and many grad programs. That\u2019s nothing to sneeze at at all\u2026it\u2019s nothing to complain about. Georgetown is on the easier end of the hardest schools to get into, you could say. It\u2019s the bottom of the very top. \n\nNot many people apply to WashingtonU because it\u2019s not close to a major city like Georgetown. Georgetown\u2019s location is a major reason people typically know about the school. When you tour DC, it\u2019s hard to miss the beautiful Hogwarts\u2019esque gothic architecture of Georgetown. Georgetown also has a rich sense of culture\u2014lots of cool shops, restaurants and the waterfront make it an attractive tourist destination. \n\nWashington University St. Louis nonetheless is a very good school, and for undergrad it\u2019s in the same league as Georgetown (Top 20ish). Same with Vanderbilt. I would say Vanderbilt is much closer in quality to Georgetown because it\u2019s in Nashville, which is an awesome city.",

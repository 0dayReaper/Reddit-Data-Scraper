I know many other schools allow you to graduate in 3 years (and save a years worth of tuition). Is this possible at Georgetown?",

This would let you have the full \"four-year experience\" but still ultimately shave a year off tuition in the long-run (if you're assuming you'd do a master's degree in a field anyway). To do this, as I recall when I did it a long time ago, you basically end up completing your undergrad requirements in 3-3.5 years or so. See https://grad.georgetown.edu/accel-prog/",

I also really futzed about with my classes, so it\u2019s more than possible to do in 3 (as long as you don\u2019t study abroad). Highly recommend graduating early and job hunting or working at an internship a few days a week.",

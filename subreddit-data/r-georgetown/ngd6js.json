However, you may incur fees from your institution to send Georgetown your transcripts.\n\nCredits have to be reviewed and approved by your dean or academic advisor; there is no payment component nor any guarantee that all of your credits will be accepted.",

Six credits is roughly two courses - it depends on your degree program.\n\n&gt; 30- and 33-credit graduate degree programs can allow a maximum of 6 total transfer credits. The 42-credit URP degree can allow a maximum of 9 total credits. In some cases, 3 credits may be awarded for a 4-credit course to remain within these limits. Executive MPS programs do not allow transfer credits.",

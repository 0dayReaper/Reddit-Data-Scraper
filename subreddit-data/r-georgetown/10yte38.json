    "postText": "Hey guys! So I\u2019ve been recently thinking about transferring to a different college and Georgetown is one of them! I\u2019m currently a freshmen (2nd semester) majoring in biology (pre dent) track. I\u2019ve heard colleges in dc are more humanities focused so I\u2019m not too sure as a stem major if it\u2019s a good idea to transfer or not. Do they have good resources for pre-health students? As well as the academics, are the profs decent and how rigorous is it? Any feedback or input would be very helpful! Thank you :)",

What\u2019s good, what\u2019s bad idk. \n\nFreshman: how are you guys like getting involved with the community? \n\nSo far everything has felt like virtual high school senior year and since I\u2019m on zoom all the time for work I\u2019ve struggled to connect with other students. \n\nJust thought I\u2019d see what\u2019s up with you all.\n\nEdit: lmao it\u2019s comforting at least that everyone is in a similar garbage situation.",

I am having a terrible terrible time. Joining clubs was basically impossible because I am pretty sure people just picked people they already knew/were established at Georgetown. I know like no professors, have made almost no meaningful connections and I hate it!!! I moved to DC because I thought we would be back to normal-ish by spring. I mean, also living at home was insufferable. Im not trying to argue with my father about washing the dishes while I'm trying to learn upper division philosophy. The plan comes out today but I have like no hope. My plan is to get a full time service job to pay my rent for spring and just hang in there.",

            "comment": "There\u2019s a couple options, either a Facebook group or Georgetown has a website dedicated to off campus housing where you can set up a profile depending on your campus. I\u2019m at the SCS campus so I\u2019m lumped in with law (that side of town). The profiles can kinda be similar to like a dating profile, you write down if you\u2019re clean, If you\u2019re a morning person, a party person, etc. and you can find people that way. Some of which already have an apartment and are looking for an extra roommate or you can find a brand new group of people to go in on an apartment with (which is what I did back in 2019). I found two other grad students and we all found an apartment together. \n\nThat being said, the DMV housing Facebook page is huge, and people are always looking for roommates if you\u2019d like to do it that way as well or don\u2019t necessarily need to live with other grad students",

Don\u2019t always look for something right by campus because those places probably have leases in them for next year already - and if not they\u2019ll be expensive. Look instead at the Georgetown shuttle routes (GUTS) that go to Arlington (loop), Dupont, Rosslyn, and up Wisconsin Ave. Those shuttles run regularly and a ton of grad students use them from across the city.\n\nRosslyn, Glover Park, Adams Morgan, Dupont Circle, Foxhall, and Burleith are among some of the most typical neighborhoods for grad students.",

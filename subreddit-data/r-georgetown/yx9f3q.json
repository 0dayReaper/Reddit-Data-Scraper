All it means is that by the time you matriculate into medical school, you must have completed that school\u2019s pre-requisite coursework (usually meaning C/C+ or better in those classes for it to count). There are pre-meds in the college, NHS, SFS, and yes, even in the MSB.",

The way the application is set up makes it seem like I have to pick the Sciences track in the College at application time.  But sounds like picking Undecided is fine and still will allow me to do premed if I want to?",

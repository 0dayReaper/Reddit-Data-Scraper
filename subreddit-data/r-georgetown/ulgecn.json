Will living in one of these LLCs mean that she\u2019ll be pressured to spend more than average on transportation, eating out, and show tickets? Or is it moderate? She\u2019ll have some spending money, but not a huge amount.",

The only time I had to \u201cspend\u201d money was when I had to put down a deposit for some tickets, which I of course got back after.",

The way it worked when I was there was that a lot of events, like cultural dinners, were open to the entire floor and held in the common room, so you could just show up to those. For the off campus events such as shows or special restaurants you usually had to reserve your spot since there were limited seats offered, sometimes with a deposit, but there was never any actual cost to going to those events either.",

            "comment": "The LLCs are great. No, you're not pressured into spending \"more than average\" to participate in activities. The LLC will host, sponsor, or coordinate events/dining (which may or may not be free to your child) events, but your child is not required to participate in order to live in the LLC. I lived in the Culture &amp; Performance LLC my freshman year (then it was hosted in Reynolds Hall in the Southwest Quad), and it was a great way to meet upperclassmen and be introduced to various clubs; overall, it helped me build community. However, the LLC will also mean that your child will not be able to bond with their freshman floor the way many other students do. It's a bit of a tradeoff. I would choose the LLC again, but I know other freshmen on my floor wouldn't. Keep that in mind! Good luck!",

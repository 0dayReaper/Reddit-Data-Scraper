    "postText": "Hi all! I am considering majoring in Global Business through the School of Foreign Service and was wondering if anyone has had experience in the major.\n\nAre students in the SFS equally as competitive when it comes to recruiting for MBB consulting, investment banking, wall street, etc.?\n\nAlso, could anyone speak to the level of proficiency needed to meet the language requirement for Spanish/Mandarin? What is taking the proficiency test like?",

[Here is a screenshot of the Class of 2021's employment for Global Business majors](https://imgur.com/a/FdEaJWY). As you can see, it is a very competitive major in the finance industry.",

Also I took the proficiency exam for Spanish and you don\u2019t need to be fluent but you do need to be able to speak very well and be well versed conversationally / in current events",

SFS language proficiency is designed to be the same level of proficiency a high school graduate from a country where that language is the native language would have. This way you should be able to speak, write, listen, and read well enough to conduct basic academic research in that language.\n\nMy Mandarin proficiency test consisted of reading a short news article of sorts (selected by the Chinese language faculty) on the day of the test, then having a short face-to-face discussion with a member of the Chinese language faculty about that article.",

    "postText": "Hi, applying fall 2023 to SFS.  \nI heard a rumor that there's not much space to take electives doing the International Affairs majors. Is this true? I want to do the Global Business double major (although i'm more passionate about the IR than about the business - still unsure if i want to do GBUS or IHIS or IPOL). and I am also considering a classics major.  \njust wondering if you guys don't actually get to do electives or if that's not true.\n\nAlso, i saw on a recent comment that the GBUS is harder to get into from SFS than MSB, is that true? and overall just like thoughts on GBUS vs IHIS/IPOL?  \nthanks!",

            "comment": "there\u2019s plenty of time for electives, the school wants you to be involved in extracurriculars. also just fyi you can\u2019t double major between schools, so a major in the sfs and a classics major in the college won\u2019t work. the application doesn\u2019t really ask you what major you\u2019re applying for; you don\u2019t declare your major until your second year. not sure abt the bsbga dual degree though, that was different for my year.",

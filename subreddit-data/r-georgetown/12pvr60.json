I was wondering if anyone lives or has lived in a single efficiency unit and has pictures of the room that you could share with me. TIA!!",

Quieter than undergrad dorms and nicer, in my opinion, if no-frills.  It was well-maintained and clean and hopefully still is. Not the greatest neighborhood (do NOT leave anything visible in your car - people would break in for small change, and there were a few violent crimes in the area) but an unbeatable commute to campus (5 minutes walk max even when limping on a sprained ankle).  Sadly, I don't have any pictures.",

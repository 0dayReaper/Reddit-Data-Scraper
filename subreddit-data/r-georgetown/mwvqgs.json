Our ceremonies will take place in two parts, with a ceremony for undergraduate students in the morning and a ceremony for graduate and professional students in the afternoon.\n\nCeremonies will be broadcast virtually for graduates, families, friends, and members of our community who are unable to attend in person.\n\nGraduates attending the ceremony in-person are invited to bring two guests. All attendees will be expected to adhere to Washington, D.C.\u2019s public health and travel guidance.\n\nWhile there are many details forthcoming, I wanted to share this news with our community as soon as possible and will continue to update our community as additional details become available. Specific information on timing, registration, seating, and additional aspects such as faculty participation will be announced soon. We are also developing contingency plans should it become necessary for us to adjust for public health or other reasons. A schedule of Commencement activities and frequently asked questions is available on our [Commencement website](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v2/0LZqc6mVv-hN/NlM5eWhqVFFIcG4zR0cyU1YwMlJ1YUdIdUZnQWllSThxZUYwbjdHazF2aENuY2hRUnRWY2NFcGhJQ1B4V0FhYzB0OEljR2hGZjVUUlhBWUF2cnQ5anZvR01vN1JiSE9OR3ZzKy9GYmxyWms9S0/NzRxSmFqMnRIK0Z3a0lQdkFxUDNZRTc3OXZVWGJacDV6NHNiMXdKOUhLL21jbFlZTmJ3R2M3bDl6VCtEczFkbUxKY1dYOVhtYlJBPQS2).\n\nOur plan was submitted to the D.C. Government and was approved earlier today. I wish to express my deep appreciation to the Nationals and Mayor Bowser for working so quickly with us on this new plan, which has enabled us to adjust plans based on the D.C. Government\u2019s new guidance on gatherings and transition from small in-person gatherings to a large in-person Commencement ceremony. This is a special opportunity for us to celebrate the Class of 2021.\n\nWe made a commitment to the Class of 2020 and the Class of 2021 that we would provide an opportunity to gather on campus and celebrate graduation with family and friends. As we see the possibility for large gatherings emerging, we are beginning to plan for these events in 2022 and are thinking creatively about how we can make these moments most special for the Class of 2020 and the Class of 2021, in recognition of the unique and challenging circumstances of their final years at Georgetown.\n\nI look forward to sharing more details with you in the coming days.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn J. DeGioia",

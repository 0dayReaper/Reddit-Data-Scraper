    "postText": "I have a freshman at GU. I am wondering why these jobs are so competitive. Bank teller and server jobs seem like minimum wage jobs for high schoolers, yet at GU, they make you write 7 essays and go through several rounds of interviews because so many people apply. So why do so many people apply? I discouraged my freshman from applying... what am I missing?",

The clubs\u2019 social and networking perks are the primary prizes, while the job opportunities therein are ancillary.\n\nIf you are seeking an on campus job, go through the Student Employment Office instead. You can find a job fairly easily without needing to work through the competitive club framework.",

I bet plenty of people would take minimum wage jobs it they knew their coworkers had a good chance of gaining high level positions in business and finance one day.\n\nAs with many things at Georgetown, the prestige of institutions is self perpetuating. People leave the Corp and Guasfcu and go on to do important things, so that incentivizes people with similar ambition to apply, creating more competition.\n\nPlenty of people get into a Georgetown program because they're willing to \"pay for the network\". With that as your baseline expectation, getting a minimum wage \\*and\\* the network starts to sound like an enticing proposition.",

But I think all clubs, even the ones that accept everyone and have no essays and interviews, provide social and leadership opportunities. So I am asking about pay because clubs don't generally pay their members and if The Corp and Guasfcu do, then that's a distinct advantage and I can see why so many kids want to write those 7 essays.",

That being said, Corpies can enjoy the social scene within club life as well as having an on-campus job with flexible hours. But unfortunately, that means membership is competitive.",

After that you matriculate into core departments and take on more complex, real-world-applicable work. Both the Corp and the Credit Union have routes into upper management. There's some appeal in running institutions worth 10+ million before you turn 21.\n\nBeyond that, most of the people I know in managerial positions in both orgs. find it a very rewarding experience. Both the Corp and GUASFCU ultimately exist to better the Georgetown community, after all, which is another reason many apply. \n\nBtw, a lot of the above doesn't apply only to The Corp or GUASFCU. There's a (slightly disturbing) amount of clubs at GU with lottery ticket acceptance rates which offer similar benefits.",

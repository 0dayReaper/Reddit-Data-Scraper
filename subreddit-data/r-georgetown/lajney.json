Meanwhile, I got rejected from all the consulting clubs despite knowing some board members.\n\nYes, knowing people plays some factor. But your qualifications/enthusiasm/excitement to learn are the most important things imho. I really do think that these clubs do their best to maintain a meritocracy, though of course it\u2019s not always perfect as with any application process.",

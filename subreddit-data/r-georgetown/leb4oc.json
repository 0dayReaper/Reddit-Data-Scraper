    "postText": "So I am looking to register for summer courses but it will be my first time registering right when it is open. I started in Spring 2021 and registered very late because my acceptance was just before the deadline.\n\nI know how registration is done at a basic level, but I was curious if you can have class registrations pre-loaded and ready to click \"submit\" right at 9am when they open. Or, does everyone have to go through the manual process of logging in right at 9am, going through and adding courses, then hitting submit.\n\nObviously, I want to secure the courses I want as I could not get them in Spring. Figured some of you might have pointers for registration and securing the classes you want.",

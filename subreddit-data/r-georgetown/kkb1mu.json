    "postText": "Hey gtown! \n\nSo I was lucky enough to be accepted early into Georgetown and I was wondering about the LLCs...\n\nI act have a few questions if any students could answer!\n\nSo I am French (from Paris) and I was thinking abt joining French LLC to see if there was a kinda french community where there are people from france as that would be super cool! obviously i would be super happy to help non-francophones with their french, but I was just wondering if it was more of an international thing or a local thing!\n\nThe other question regards LLC as Freshmen! If anyone has/knows someone who went into one as a freshman: would you say that kinda limits your ability to social (because you\u2019re around less freshmen), or do you make more upperclassmen friends, or does it not change anything?\n\nThank you in advance for any replies! If you\u2019re French/ in Paris rn and coming into GTown def hit me up..! Also merry xmas everyone :)",

            "comment": "Hi! Just wanted to let you know that most LLCs are only for upperclassmen, including the French LLC. If you click this link [here](https://residentialliving.georgetown.edu/leadership/llc/) you can see which LLCs you can apply to as a first year student (I believe there are 4 or 5 of them).\n\nAlso, just an additional note-- I lived on the French floor my sophomore year, and from what I remember it was mostly comprised of students learning French and not students from France. However, the floor below (the Global Living LLC) had a lot of international students, including quite a few French students, so that may be more of what you are looking for.\n\nHope this helps!",

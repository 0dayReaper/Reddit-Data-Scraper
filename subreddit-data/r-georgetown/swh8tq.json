            "comment": "At my internship I worked with a few students from that program. They all spoke highly of it, and it seemed like it was a mix of comp sci, statistics, and pure math classes. One of the data analytics alumni I knew is now working as a data scientist at capital one, which according to Glassdoor pats in the low/mid 6-figure range (I\u2019m not implying that money is everything but still good to know that you can have a solid outcome from that program). I would definitely do it if you want to Peruse a more data-heavy career path.",

If you ever come across a Big Data class by Jose Luis Guerrero, deffy take that. Worth researching your local Georgetown Club (an alumni club basically) and getting into socializing there. Highly recommend that. Get a Georgetown sweatshirt. Enjoy DC, explore M Street (or is it N Street?--the street with J. Crew and all the stores on it). Have dinner at the Tombs, a classic Georgetown hangout spot. Explore the library. Challenge yourself to become an expert on data science--join Reddits, Discords, follow Twitter acccounts.",

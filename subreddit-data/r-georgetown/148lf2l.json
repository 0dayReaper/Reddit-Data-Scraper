    "postText": "Hi all! I'm sure that this is a question that has been asked before, so if there is a post I should be redirected to then feel free to comment that, but I am wondering about whether or not I should apply to the Walsh School of Foreign Service this year. I'm definitely interested in going into international relations, but in terms of my high school extracurriculars, my school doesn't have a Model UN or anything of the sort, so I don't have anything that is specifically oriented towards international relations. I'm captain of our speech and debate teach, as well as a founder for a local politics journal, and have leadership roles in multiple nonprofits and political organizations, but I'm wondering if this just means I should apply for the College of Arts and Sciences for something such as a Government Major and then try to internally transfer (if I even got in), or of I should apply to the Walsh School of Foreign service and try my best to write a great essay for the Foreign Service Prompt. I guess my question just boils down to is it possible to be accepted into the Walsh School of Foreign service without having extracurriculars like Model UN that are specific to IR. Also, all of this is hypothetical and assuming I could get into Georgetown in the first place, which is obviously not guaranteed. Any advice is appreciated, thank you!",

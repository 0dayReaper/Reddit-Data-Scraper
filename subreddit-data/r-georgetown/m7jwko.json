            "comment": "OK, I'll be the bearer of bad news: Georgetown is almost uniquely positioned to be difficult to reach from affordable housing.  The [University runs its own bus shuttle service](https://transportation.georgetown.edu/guts/), because [very few Metro buses go to campus](https://www.wmata.com/schedules/maps/).  Some people solve this problem by [living close to campus](https://ochlistings.georgetown.edu/), but this only works if you're the sort of person who is willing to pay more to live in a city -- the neighborhood around Georgetown is very, very nice and very, very expensive.  Those who use the shuttles tend to live either in the apartment complexes on Wisconsin Ave, or around the Orange Line stations (Rosslyn outward).\n\nMany grad students prefer to instead take classes at the \"Continuing Education\" buildings, as these are much easier to reach from cheap housing: the Clarendon building is very easy to reach from most of Arlington/Fairfax and even some parts of DC/MD, and the Chinatown building is within a couple blocks of every rail line and about a dozen major bus lines.",

I cannot express how sad and appalled most of us are by the recent hate crimes against people of Asian descent. \n\nSecond, the answer is \u2018low\u2019. In the whole of DC there were approximately 3 hate crimes in all of the city. \n\nThird, DC is a really culturally diverse place but still has crime like any big city. Fortunately, the campus does a really good job (especially the surrounding neighborhoods) of creating a really safe space. \n\nHave you visited the campus? I hope you felt that same vibe I did in undergrad. \n\nTake care.",

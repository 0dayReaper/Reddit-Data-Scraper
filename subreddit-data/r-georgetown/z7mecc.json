College life on campus is non-existent, aside from a few events here and there. People just go out with their friends or chill in their houses/dorms, which is fun ig. Dating is present but heavily stigmatized as the culture is very conservative. If you come from a liberal/Western background, avoid, avoid, avoid.",

English shouldn't be a benchmark. Quality of assignments, post-graduation destinations, etc... also factors. Although they do have a large pool of internationals, who are definitely of higher caliber.",

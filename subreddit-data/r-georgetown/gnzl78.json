            "comment": "The MSB has a curve, so in your MSB classes you are competing with your classmates for a good grade. This isn\u2019t the case in non-MSB classes though. \n\nThe other competitiveness you\u2019ll hear about is the club culture. There are some clubs on campus that are pretty tough to get into, but there are plenty more that are not competitive and/or allow anyone to join. \n\nThe overall campus vibe is not competitive imo. People are friendly and collaborative in my experience.\n\nThe MSB is one of the best business schools in the country. I\u2019m not sure what your other option is, but all of my MSB friends have enjoyed their time here and have gotten really solid jobs right out of the gate.",

Definitely recommend attending, the alumni network is very strong and there are amazing opportunities you won\u2019t get elsewhere. There is a huge emphasis on group projects and I would say that people somewhat competitive when it comes to certain things but it\u2019s not cutthroat or anything. Some classes have participation grades but quality was emphasized over quantity. \n\nKeep in mind that you\u2019ll take classes in the other schools and join clubs, 99% of which don\u2019t have a low acceptance rates. This will give you some perspective of life outside the MSB and potentially boost your GPA if you\u2019re worried about that. I met some of my best friends at GU in both the MSB and in the other schools. Feel free to PM me with other questions.",

There are a lot of people who are \"competitive\" in the sense that they have strong personal ambition-but competitive isn't necessarily the right word for that since most people are \\*not\\* aiming to knock others down on their way up. Georgetown as a whole is more collaborative than competitive, and I've found that the vibe on college admissions forums/among incoming students makes the school seem more competitive than it really is.\n\nCurrent student.",

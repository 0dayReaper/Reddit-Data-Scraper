    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a prospective student (annoying I know), and I was curious if there are any jazz enthusiasts who could tell me a little bit about any groups, concerts, or anything else related (on or off-campus) that relates to jazz. I\u2019m guessing this year is a bit *different,* but I\u2019d love to get a better idea than what the website tells me (not much). Thanks!",

            "comment": "It\u2019s not a huge program, but there definitely is jazz on campus. You can audition for the big band or form your own combo, which is what I did. This year obviously the program was kinda dead, but I assume it\u2019ll start up again next year. When I was a freshman they offered a jazz pre-O to play at convocation, which was a good experience and a nice way to get introduced to the program, so hopefully they\u2019ll offer that again. \n\nAs far as off-campus stuff, Blues Alley is a really cool venue that\u2019s just a few blocks away if you\u2019re looking for a little more traditional stuff, and then U-Street Music Hall has a lot of more modern gigs. There\u2019s definitely Jazz in the city if you\u2019re looking for it . \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",

It was taught by Will Layman and falls under the INAF course listing. It was a one-credit and might not be offered this year but if they bring it back it\u2019d be a great course to take!",

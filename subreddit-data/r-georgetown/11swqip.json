    "postText": "I\u2019m waiting to hear back from Penn still, but my top choices are Georgetown and Brandeis. Brandeis offered me 50% off tuition and a spot for their 2024 PhD program. It seems to really want me. Georgetown accepted me but hasn\u2019t given me info on financial aid, however they have a much higher ranking than Brandeis. I\u2019ve spoken with some Brandeis students and they\u2019ve had nothing but amazing things to say about the program, but I haven\u2019t had a chance to speak with any Georgetown students. I\u2019m worried that it may be a toxic environment and come with a lot of the difficulties associated with prestigious high ranked school. Would any grad students, specifically grad students in the humanities/English program be willing to share their experiences?",

Gtown humanities professors are amazing when it comes to supporting students, too. During my undergrad years here, I did feel the toxic pressure among students a bit, but that completely changed when I went to grad school - it's a completely different world - I've truly never seen/experienced this much support from peers, whether it be academic or social.",

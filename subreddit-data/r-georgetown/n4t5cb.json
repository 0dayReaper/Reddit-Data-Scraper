            "comment": "In the Georgetown neighborhood you can \"rent\" a parking permit from students who have houses off campus in Burleith or West Georgetown. Usually runs in the range of 200-250 a month and you usually find one by word of mouth. This is not technically allowed, but in practice works fine. Otherwise, yeah there's Rosslyn or free parking on streets further out.\n\n I'd avoid relying on GUTS Arlington which is infrequent/limited hours, but GUTS Rosslyn is frequent on the weekdays (no weekend service though, but you can park on campus on weekends).",

Parking permits cannot be obtained very easily for gtown undergrads from personal experience so idk what you're talking about with \"renting\" a parking permit from off campus students. You end up having to register the car with the city, doing vehicle inspection, etc and have to have a paid off car with an out of state title if you want to avoid excise taxes.\n\nMy advice is to just find off campus parking through facebook or other network. Or you could go through the hassle of trying to get a DC parking permit, but that's a super long process since we aren't eligible for reciprocity.",

You just have to seek them out on facebook, craigslist and such, there's no real one direct source. 200 isn't terrible, but I definitely think your could work that down a bit. Often nurses, med students, grad students and senior undergrads sell off spots in the burleith and west georgetown areas, you just need to kind of search around.",

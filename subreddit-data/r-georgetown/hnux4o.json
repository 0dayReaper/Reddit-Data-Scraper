Very creepy. \n\nFor bonus points, go to the tunnels underneath the building. The entrance is on the ground floor, you just have to snoop around to find it. It giant, pitch black, and probably filled w/ asbestos so you\u2019ll need a respirator. The tunnel used to connect into the old medical center, and led through a old graveyard from Gtown\u2019s slaveholding days. From what I hear though, it no longer connects, and is a dead end.",

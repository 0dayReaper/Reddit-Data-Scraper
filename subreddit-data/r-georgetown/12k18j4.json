            "comment": "Less specific but more of a general piece of advice I wish I\u2019d had when I joined. When looking at ticking off core requirements, try and find classes with multiple attributes. That way you can tick off multiple requirements in a single class (I\u2019ve taken a class which fulfilled 3 core requirements attributes in 1 class for example). You can do this by narrowing down by attribute when looking at registration on MyAccess.\n\nJust in general I\u2019ve found the most interesting ones are also the ones with the most reading/toughest grading. So it\u2019s a trade off between easy &amp; interesting most of the time. \n\nOh and whatever you do don\u2019t take GOV-2400 with Joel Simmons. Avoid it like the plague. Take anyone else for CPS.",

                                    "comment": "Depends. \n\nLarge generalised classes which everyone has to take are taught by a number of professors who each have an expertise but will teach general classes as well. For example ISec is taught by Prof Kroenig who is an expert in nuclear strategy. So if you want to take a class specifically in nuclear strategy you\u2019ll take it with him, but he\u2019ll also teach the general one as an expert in the overall field of international security. \n\nMost classes are taught by the specific experts though. So if you take a class in International Trade Law and the WTO you\u2019ll get Busch who\u2019s an expert in that. Or immigration and conflict you\u2019ll get Brown who\u2019s an expert on that field etc etc.",

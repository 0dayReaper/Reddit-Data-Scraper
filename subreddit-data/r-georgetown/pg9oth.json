    "postText": "Hello! I have been looking into both the SSP masters program and masters in applied intelligence but I cannot tell whether the Applied intelligence masters is a subdivision of the SSP program or completely different entirely. Does anyone know what the interplay is between these two masters programs, if any? Which do you think is more useful in pursuing a DOJ/government intelligence position? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Background- I am an attorney (25f) looking to get into a legal job with FBI, DOJ, intelligence agencies, etc.)",

            "comment": "They are mostly separate, as SSP is housed under the School of Foreign Service (SFS) while Master's in Applied Intelligence is under the School of Continuing Studies (SCS). \n\nSSP is definitely more selective and more integrated into the main campus of Georgetown, while the SCS programs are in a separate part of DC. I can't tell you for sure which would be better for job prospects, but I can't imagine SSP would be worse. SSP/SFS students can also access the SFS graduate career center, which is well-established and known for being effective.",

            "comment": "Both will be helpful, SSP definitely has more prestige being in SFS, but I don't think that you could go wrong given the robust adjunct faculty in both programs. Both are flexible and have part-time options, but SSP will give you a more traditional college experience as it's hosted on the main campus.\n\nSSP has 5 concentrations for the M.A. in Security Studies, one of which is intelligence. The M.P.S. in applied intelligence is a stand-alone degree without concentrations.\n\nThe WalshWorks network of jobs is incredibly valuable as it's a job board specifically for SFS students (read: SCS doesn't have this). SSP has it's own job group as well where every job posted comes with a referral for the position, the fact you completed the program is enough for them to vouch for you.\n\nNot sure how applicable this is since you're already an attorney but SSP also has a Joint J.D./MA in Security Studies Program. \n\nAdditionally, if you're interested in the IC and want to develop language skills, programs under the Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences also offer unlimited language scholarships for courses below the 350 level, (I took a few courses of intensive Russian), this is not offered to SCS students. It's not a competitive scholarship application process, it's literally a Google Form you fill out in order to be reimbursed for the cost of tuition.\n\nPersonally, I think SSP will give you a bit more clout in the IC space if that's what you're looking for, and since they're comparable in cost, I'd just advise to go with whichever gives you more financial assistance or what feels right. Look at the course catalogs for both programs. I found the Applied Intelligence's course list to be much more limited than what is offered in SSP. Do your diligence and attend some info sessions, talk to alumni of both programs, and determine where you would be a better fit for. Admission to SSP is fairly competitive (&lt;25% of applicants get admitted, and this gets worse each year. The Applied Intelligence program on the other hand doesn't publish acceptance rates so it's somewhat of a shot in the dark.",

I am so eager to get into Georgetown under one of these programs or Johns Hopkins' similar programs, but they both have such low acceptance rates and my law school performance was just average. To say I am nervous to see what I get accepted into is an understatement ! \n\nI will certainly do some research in the meantime to see which program is a better fit !",

I feel like admissions candidates go into 2 buckets: Fresh out of undergrad, hyper-competitive IR majors from prestigious universities, and then the rest of us. There are a good bit of Ivy League graduates in my classes, but there are also a lot of military veterans, full-time professionals who are transitioning from different careers. You never know if you don't try and the fact that you're a practicing attorney is a good thing to separate you from the hordes of applicants. I think with a strong SOP you'd be a good candidate.",

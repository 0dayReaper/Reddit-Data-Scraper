The roommate finder is open and you can message people but I\u2019m not sure who / when to message. I\u2019m just looking for a normal roommate in a dorm without all the extra stuff like quads etc. Anyone have experience with this?",

Using the search function does not lock you into a certain type of room don\u2019t worry. \n\nAlso this year probably less than 10% of sophomores at the most will be in anything other than a standard dorm room based on the halls available.",

I really don\u2019t mind staying masked and outside as long as my family and I (all vaccinated) get to see this professor (also vaccinated) even at a safe social distance. College campuses present a really unique challenge during pandemics (my parents teach at a different university, so they TOTALLY get it too), so the most important thing IMO is keeping the campus safe. This particular professor does live full time on campus, so that\u2019s another reason why I\u2019m asking. Thanks for the info!",

Even during the height of the pandemic, campus did not formally close (i.e. the public could wander around as they please, as usual).\n\nHowever, in the past year, building access has been severed limited to protect students, faculty, and staff. At this time, building access is still restricted.\n\nThe mask mandate is still active for those living or working on campus, while inside campus facilities.",

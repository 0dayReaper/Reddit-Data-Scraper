    "postText": "I\u2019m a premed and was wondering if I could get any input. \n\nShaun Brinsmade is the only Professor for Biological Chemistry but it seems like rate my professor is yelling not to take his class. I can either do bio chem / genetics (seems like the genetics professor and class is much better and although I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to take genetics I might like biochemistry better)\n\nDoes anyone who has taken any of these classes / know these professors have any input? It would help a lot thanks :)\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the input, decided it would be best to take genetics!",

Brinsmade is a nicer human, but he can't teach and is a very harsh grader. Rosenwald is a bit colder but is a genius, extremely good teacher, and a fair grader.\n\nRonda Rolfes usually teaches genetics, she's an average prof, no major complaints, but she's very lenient and extremely approachable during OH's. If you take Genetics, take section I for lab, if it is the same as when I took it, you get to experience professor Choi who is the literal gem of the bio department.",

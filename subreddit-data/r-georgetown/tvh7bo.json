    "postText": "hi, i was admitted to the SFS for undergrad but am also really interested in studying physics and had a few questions about the physics program/in general:\n\n1. how ample are research opps to non-physics majors?\n2. how are the physics professors? supportive?\n3. how rigorous is the physics curriculum? is there a certain type of physics that georgetown tends to focus on or is it quite broad?\n4. would you say most people are nerdy?\n5. how is the music scene? is the orchestra good?\n6. is club tennis competitive?",

            "comment": "6) Club tennis is as competitive as one makes it. They have tournament teams that are opt-in or occasionally utilize tryouts (mostly for limited slots). However, the everyday practices are open to all interested players, regardless of skill level - akin to intramural tennis. A lot of the matches are based on general interest rather than ability.\n\nSource: I am a former VP.",

            "comment": "no, not everyone's nerdy. people can be really intense about school sometimes, a lot of people you meet can be pretty stressed out. but that comes with any smaller elite school i think. but there are some dope people here, if you come you will find some people you think are cool, no matter your tastes... the thing is that georgetown is a SMALL place, physically and just in terms of undergrad population. if you join a club or a certain scene on campus its usually tight group of people in the sense that you can become sort of closed in the bubble of that certain group of people. \n\nhowever dc is a cool ass place to live, if you find yourself getting suffocated by georgetown and feel like youre living so deep in it, making an effort to get to know different parts of the city will be really fun, freeing, useful etc \n\ndont know too much about physics at georgetown, stem is smaller here for obvious reasons. you could look up the physics department and read descriptions of professors and staff in general for a better idea to see if youre intrigued. are you familiar with stia ? its science tech and intl affairs, a major in the sfs where you pick a science and then take mainly sfs courses, so u could pick physics, comsci, bio, etc and take those classes adn then get a degree with an intl affairs vibe to it.",

The physics curriculum is not at all rigorous and basically all professors only do soft matter research.",

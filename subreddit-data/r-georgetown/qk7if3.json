    "postText": "Hey all! I'm considering applying for the Master's in CCT. Has anyone does this program? I'd be curious to hear about your experience.\n\n1. What are your opinions about it? Was/Is it worth it? Is the CCT program looked down upon by other Georgetown students? I know other schools have \"cash cow\" programs that are treated noticeable different from their more-recognized programs.\n2. How is being a grad student at Georgetown? I'm very worried about the cost. I will definitely have to get a job. How has your experience/post-graduate career confirmed that, even with the cost, this was the right move?\n3. Is there a hierarchy or noticeable difference in those who choose to go the Coursework route vs those that take the Thesis route? Are those who choose not to write a thesis looked down upon in networking or post-grad situations?\n4. How is it being with a cohort? That was one of the most important aspects in choosing a graduate program...I want to attend somewhere that has a social aspect as well and isn't all just online.\n\nSorry if the questions are open-ended. I am open to anything anyone can share. :) Thanks so much!",

He said the program was fun but not practical. Also, the interdisciplinary aspect made it hard for him to have specialized skills.",

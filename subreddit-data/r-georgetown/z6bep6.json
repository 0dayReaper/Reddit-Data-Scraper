Could I ask if someone could help direct me to STM 120 or at least what STM means? Is it short for St. Mary's Hall by chance - saw that on a map but wanted to check. Thanks!",

The easiest way to get there is to enter campus from Reservoir Road at the entrance slightly beyond 37th St if you\u2019re going in the direction of ascending numerical order.  The entrance is on the left side of the street.  You should see some wooden barriers there.  Continue down the path from the entrance, and St. Mary\u2019s is the first building on the right.  It\u2019s the building that has wooden stairs and a ramp in front of it.",

    "postText": "Hello incoming Georgetown graduate student here. I\u2019m trying to find an apartment to live and I was really interested in the welive crystal city apartments. However I won\u2019t have a car and google maps is showing that by bus or train it takes 30-40 minutes to get to Georgetown. Anyone live or knows someone that lives there that can shed some light on the public transport from there to Georgetown? Thanks!!",

That said, campus is notoriously inaccessible by public transport so keep that in mind.",

Transit vehicles in general are rarely on time all of the time. However, the Rosslyn GUTS loop is popular so they typically adhere to the schedule, particularly in the mornings and evenings to accommodate commuting students and staff.\n\nTake a look at \u201c**Campus Resources**\u201d in the sidebar for more information on GUTS, including routes and schedules.",

Two notes:\n\n1- I get to campus really easily using the Arlington Transit bus ART43 (5 min walk from weLive) that takes you to Rosslyn, and then the Rosslyn GUTS bus. Overall if you time it right it\u2019s like a 15-20 minute commute which is really good!\n\n2- Technically it is no longer a WeLive! The building is now being operated as a regular apartment building by JBG Smith, which owns most of crystal city. I think the wonderful staff is staying and not much has changed though! \n\nHope this helps!",

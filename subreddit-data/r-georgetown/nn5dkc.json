Otherwise there\u2019s a Facebook page for housing in the DMV with about 50,000 people in it - you can either find roommates or find a place yourself if that\u2019s more your style. \n\nTiming at SCS might be more of a concern for you, some classes end at 10:30/11 at night which makes commuting back late at night also a pain since the metro closes at 11 during the week. Not always, and there\u2019s ways around it, but was one of my issues my first year before I got used to it.",

Being in a relationship doesn't really matter if you commute back by yourself anyway. I ended up living very close to SCS my first year when classes were still in person, so I could walk home. Now I live a few metro stops away but I'm used to the city and the metro and would have no problem commuting home by myself, but I understand others might not have the same security/safety concerns that I do. Happy to answer any other questions you might have!",

I don't mean to sound full of myself at all but I am a very good writer (or so I'm told), so I'm sure that's part of the reason my turnaround time was so quick for acceptance.\n\nThat being said, the prompt I had was very close to a supplemental essay I wrote for a different school, so I basically just copied and pasted that. I had gotten into that other school so I assumed the essay was at least halfway decent lol.",

            "comment": "when i toured georgetown, my tour guide was on the premed track and specifically emphasized how Georgetown profs are especially open to undergrads doing research (my tour  guide herself was doing cancer research at the georgetown medical school nearby) and how there's so many federal agencies in the DC area who provide stem internships, etc (ex: national institute of health, etc). also the early-assurance program for georgetown school of medicine, which is offered to undergrads/premeds at georgetown and she said something about skipping the mcat or whatever. honesty just do ur research, it seems like georgetown has lots of opportunities for premeds even tho it has the reputation of being a humanities/politics/etc-focused school!!! good luckkk",

            "comment": "Besides what was already said about the abundant undergraduate research opportunities and the early assurance program to med school (both of which are great opportunities), I would say it depends on your major. If you\u2019re in the school of health or school of nursing, then you\u2019ll enjoy relatively small class sizes (with the exception of some general pre-med requirements, like general Chemistry lecture). I can\u2019t really attest to what it\u2019s like in the College but I would assume it\u2019s more or less the same. I think one difference though is that college pre-meds take regular bio while pre-meds in the health schools take human bio. And yea feel free to ask me any more questions (dms are fine).",

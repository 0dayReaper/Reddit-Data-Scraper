Having said that, the applicant pool is extremely self-selecting because you generally need at least a 3.8 GPA to be competitive for admission, so that stat is a little misleading on face value. Highly recommend talking to the prelaw advisor to get advice on the other factors like your personal statement! They'll probably be able to give you some idea of whether you'll be a competitive applicant as well.",

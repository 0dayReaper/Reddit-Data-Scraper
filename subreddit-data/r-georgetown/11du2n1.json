    "postText": "A friend was dropping some food off and their car was parked halfway off of the arrow for the allowed street parking area without their hazards. They literally were there for about 15 minutes and came back to a $125 ticket owed to GU. It says that eventually the citation will be forwarded to the Citation Processing Center. Could they possibly just ignore this or will there be legal/license complications in the future?",

If you have or plan on having a DC license or Registration, it could become a problem, but rn DC is notorious for having a lot of people with unpaid tickets so not really sure how much of a barrier that actually is",

His car had Utah plates, and the dude writing the ticket had shitty handwriting..so all the tickets looked like VT instead of UT.  Never paid a cent...",

            "comment": "I was FLL, and at the time I was there (mid-2000s), we had some additional requirements that we had to fulfill in addition to our College requirements. The one I remember for sure was that we had to focus on a main language (or linguistics), and also study another language up to a certain level. For this reason, many FLL students either double-majored in linguistics and a language or two languages, or minored in another language. There may have also been a requirement to study abroad, or maybe it was just that it was highly encouraged\u2014I can\u2019t remember, unfortunately. However, every FLL student I knew studied abroad. It\u2019s safe to say there\u2019s a big culture of all GU students attending study abroad programs among the four colleges.",

They basically elected to absorb the language majors. If you are a language major, you are a College student, not an FLL student.\n\nThere are not separate requirements for language programs; instead, you would want to look at the College\u2019s graduate requirements for reference.",

I studied abroad in Nice, France my junior year. I went on the get a JD/MBA from Berkeley. Loved my time at Georgetown. Globalism permeates the entire university!",

But with the dorm reshuffle this year, and more students living on campus, the numbers will be a little different than usual so who knows. \n\nMost sophomores this year are going to be in a. Southwest Quad (Kennedy/McCarthy) b. Village C and c. LXR. Do not expect to get anything other than one of those, but there's a tiny chance you could get lucky.",

This year, they\u2019re turning Copley and Reynolds(?) into freshman dorms and Village C West and East will be sophomores #Whack. \n\nYour only real chance at getting Henle is by living with juniors and/or seniors to put your housing group ahead of all the sophomores.",

I\u2019m an exchange student joining Georgetown Uni this coming Fall semester (Aug-Dec).\n\nBeen trying to hunt for housing on Facebook groups and the GU housing rental platform, but have not found any luck :( hence reaching out here on Reddit! \n\nPlease let me know if you are looking to sublet your place or know of any places I could look into! \n\nSpecifically, I am looking for a 3-people off-campus housing near GU.\n\nThank you \ud83d\ude4f",

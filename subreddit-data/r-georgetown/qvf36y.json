As an international, most of the bars that I frequented were those showing football (\u201csoccer\u201d) games: ECL matches at The Lucky Bar in Dupont Circle or Flanagan\u2019s in Bethesda for Celtic FC\u2019s weekend fixtures (hosted by the DC CSC). I also often went to the legendary Brickskeller in Dupont (sadly long defunct) which was at that time probably the only watering hole in DC with a truly global range of beers.",

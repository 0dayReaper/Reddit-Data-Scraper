I have personally enrolled in several 18-credit semesters (same as you are proposing: five courses total, one intensive language course and the rest as three-credit courses). It is a lot of work.\n\nHowever, I want to reassure you that it is a viable schedule. Use the Add/Drop period to figure out if you can handle the workload and go from there. Worst case, you can withdraw, get a W, and move on. One of two Ws will not hurt you unless you plan to go to medical school or another competitive graduate field (and even then, one or two is alright).",

Yes, you can add or drop any courses you would like during the A/D period.\n\nYou may want to reach out to your academic advisor or peer advisor - they are readily equipped to answer these types of questions. You would get more reliable responses than from a bunch of Redditors. A lot of your inquiries are subjective, but they would be able to help you map out a plan that works best for you.",

Are you an incoming freshman? If so, I would ease up and take fewer courses your first semester (aim for 15 credits) and see how well you can manage that and take some time to adjust to college coursework. It also depends on what your other classes are, if you placed out of intro Micro/Macro and you're taking intermediate or itrade/ifinance, or if you're taking a hard science or something, that might be more difficult to manage than if your other classes will be easy. \n\nAlso it's been 5 years since I was a freshman but don't you have to take both PoG and Writ-015 your freshman year? I had to take PoG in the Fall and Writ-015 in the spring because of where my name fell in the alphabet, but maybe that's just an SFS thing. If you don't take either this semester are you going to take both next semester?",

For a first year, first semester student, 18 credits is a lot.\n\n&gt; Also it's been 5 years since I was a freshman but don't you have to take both PoG and Writ-015 your freshman year? \n\nWRIT-015 is mandatory for first years; PoG is not.\n\nAdvisors typically encourage students to take PoG early, but you can fulfill your theology requirements whenever. I took BibLit as the lone senior in my class lol.",

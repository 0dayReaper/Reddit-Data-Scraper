It\u2019s a lot of reading of historical texts and applying it to modern day issues you would experience in your career. It goes over Greek philosophers, Kant, utilitarianism, and religious teachings like the Jesuit teachings. I barely scrapped by with an A. It was very hard I couldn\u2019t imagine getting a bachelors in the subject. I\u2019m assuming that would be like 30-40 credits worth of deep philosophical thinking. The class was rewarding and I do feel better for it.",

Not sure what your question about grading means, every professor is different, there is no departmental policy that is different about grades. Some classes have been very difficult some easier, just like any other major. Joel Reynolds and Quill kuckla (not sure if I spelled those right) are the people who do lots with bioethics in the Phil department. I would encourage you to take a class with Lydia X Z Brown though, or at least look into them. They are a lawyer in the disability studies department and quite frankly a genius.",

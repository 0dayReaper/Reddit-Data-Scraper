It's not necessary so if you would just be reiterating extracurriculars, no need to include one. \n\nIf you attach a resume (and this is just true in general), it should highlight work, significant volunteer, or internship experiences. There are a lot of templates online, just make it one easy-to-read page.",

You don\u2019t have to create one solely for apps, but just know that lots of club applications and every internship/job opportunity you will get will always ask for one, so keep that in mind when deciding whether or not to make one. As for templates, there are plenty of professional ones to be found online, so customize them to your needs",

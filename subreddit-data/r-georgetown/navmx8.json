Please see the details below. I also am sharing the message below that was sent to students today, which contains additional information about their COVID-19 vaccination requirement.\n\n**On-Campus Vaccination**\n\nWe are now able to vaccinate students, faculty and staff on campus, at no cost to community members. Vaccines will be available on a rolling basis. \n\nAt this time, the vaccine that will be administered is the two-dose COVID-19 vaccine produced by Moderna. After receiving your first vaccine, you can make an appointment for the second vaccine for 28 days later. You must receive both shots to be fully vaccinated.\n\nIf you are interested in getting vaccinated on campus, please email chiefpublichealthofficer@georgetown.edu to indicate your interest, and we will follow up to provide additional details.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to our partners at the DC Department of Health for enabling us to offer this opportunity to our community.\n\nWe will provide more details about future clinics throughout the summer.\n\n**Vaccination Documentation**\n\nIf you have already been vaccinated, please submit documentation of your COVID-19 vaccination through the GU360 mobile app or [GU360 website](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v2/WeKNHK2PR0H7/YVZkZWlUQ0VaTW5GcEYyQWNQeDFXbmx4SnVmZkFEakh3MEdTNko4ZmpiYzhreWdCazFxK0wzaDN4NHNPbzdUYlJhNXdlcUNqSHRFTHQ1Q2hnbUxaZG11dCs5ZUVwek10dFVaRDVSUXJoTzA9S0/NXhvZmVqRkxtOFlEOThyV21qSWdCcWVJdVhJRkUwNWZpVFlUTDFXWnB3aGhVeDZpaEJoT3M5QUpvNjg3S2g3cmRzcUdXZmNjQ2lrSDVoWi9DU1JKc0FsejRyK2lzYWQxS0).

I am also very happy to announce that students, faculty and staff are now able to get vaccinated on campus, at no cost. Please see the details below.\n\n**COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement**\n\nAs President DeGioia shared in his April 14 message, we will require undergraduate, graduate and professional students to be fully immunized prior to the Fall 2021 semester. Students enrolled in online programs that do not have any on-campus components are exempt from this requirement.\n\n**Accepted Vaccines**\n\n**To meet this requirement, students will need to be fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorized by the [Food and Drug Administration](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v2/LE0yQx6ePpcv/YVZkZWlUQ0VaTW5GcEYyQWNQeDFXbmx4SnVmZkFEakh3MEdTNko4ZmpiYzhreWdCazFxK0wzaDN4NHNPbzdUYlJhNXdlcUNqSHRFTHQ1Q2hnbUxaZG11dCs5ZUVwek10dFVaRDVSUXJoTzA9S0/) or the [World Health Organization](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v2/34Lmc4_grxMG/YVZkZWlUQ0VaTW5GcEYyQWNQeDFXbmx4SnVmZkFEakh3MEdTNko4ZmpiYzhreWdCazFxK0wzaDN4NHNPbzdUYlJhNXdlcUNqSHRFTHQ1Q2hnbUxaZG11dCs5ZUVwek10dFVaRDVSUXJoTzA9S0/).** Currently, this combined list includes Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen), AstraZeneca, COVISHIELD and Sinopharm. The FDA and WHO may authorize additional vaccines in the coming weeks and months.\n\nIf you are not able to receive one of these vaccines at this time, we encourage you to receive the vaccine that is available to you at the earliest opportunity in order to protect yourselves, your family and others. We will help students who have not been vaccinated or who have received a vaccine that has not been authorized by the FDA or WHO to get an authorized vaccine on campus upon arrival. Please refer to this [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v2/KaZvTxGYPDc8/YVZkZWlUQ0VaTW5GcEYyQWNQeDFXbmx4SnVmZkFEakh3MEdTNko4ZmpiYzhreWdCazFxK0wzaDN4NHNPbzdUYlJhNXdlcUNqSHRFTHQ1Q2hnbUxaZG11dCs5ZUVwek10dFVaRDVSUXJoTzA9S0/) for more information.\n\nWe recognize our international students face unique challenges and uncertainties caused by the pandemic. Please review the CDC\u2019s [international travel guidelines](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v2/2W4mTgbAV7ha/YVZkZWlUQ0VaTW5GcEYyQWNQeDFXbmx4SnVmZkFEakh3MEdTNko4ZmpiYzhreWdCazFxK0wzaDN4NHNPbzdUYlJhNXdlcUNqSHRFTHQ1Q2hnbUxaZG11dCs5ZUVwek10dFVaRDVSUXJoTzA9S0/). We will provide updated information about traveling to DC, including testing and quarantine requirements, as it becomes available closer to the Fall semester. \n\n**Vaccination Documentation**\n\nIf you have not already done so, please submit your COVID-19 vaccination documentation through the GU360 mobile app or GU360 website.\n\nPlease also make sure your health information and other immunization records are up-to-date in the [Georgetown University Immunization and Health Information Database Portal](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v2/9bvWB62mK~CX/YVZkZWlUQ0VaTW5GcEYyQWNQeDFXbmx4SnVmZkFEakh3MEdTNko4ZmpiYzhreWdCazFxK0wzaDN4NHNPbzdUYlJhNXdlcUNqSHRFTHQ1Q2hnbUxaZG11dCs5ZUVwek10dFVaRDVSUXJoTzA9S0/).\n\n**Medical and Religious Exemptions**\nAs with all of our existing vaccination requirements for students, medical and religious exemptions will be granted in accordance with federal and local law.\n\nStudents may request a medical or religious exemption from the COVID-19 vaccination requirement by completing the [exemption request form](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v2/d3wrhWy8j9SE/YVZkZWlUQ0VaTW5GcEYyQWNQeDFXbmx4SnVmZkFEakh3MEdTNko4ZmpiYzhreWdCazFxK0wzaDN4NHNPbzdUYlJhNXdlcUNqSHRFTHQ1Q2hnbUxaZG11dCs5ZUVwek10dFVaRDVSUXJoTzA9S0/) and submitting the information required.\n\n**On-Campus Vaccination Clinic**\n\nWe are now able to vaccinate students, faculty and staff on campus, at no cost to community members. Vaccines will be available on a rolling basis. \n\nAt this time, the vaccine that will be administered is the two-dose COVID-19 vaccine produced by Moderna. After receiving your first vaccine, you can make an appointment for the second vaccine for 28 days later. You must receive both shots to be fully vaccinated.\n\nIf you are interested in getting vaccinated on campus, please email chiefpublichealthofficer@georgetown.edu to indicate your interest, and we will follow up to provide additional details.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to our partners at the DC Department of Health for enabling us to offer this opportunity to our community.\n\nWe will provide more details about future clinics throughout the summer.\n\nPlease refer to the University\u2019s [COVID-19 Vaccines web page](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v2/8Ed7QAxK62SW/YVZkZWlUQ0VaTW5GcEYyQWNQeDFXbmx4SnVmZkFEakh3MEdTNko4ZmpiYzhreWdCazFxK0wzaDN4NHNPbzdUYlJhNXdlcUNqSHRFTHQ1Q2hnbUxaZG11dCs5ZUVwek10dFVaRDVSUXJoTzA9S0/NXhvZmVqRkxtOFlEOThyV21qSWdCcWVJdVhJRkUwNWZpVFlUTDFXWnB3aGhVeDZpaEJoT3M5QUpvNjg3S2g3cmRzcUdXZmNjQ2lrSDVoWi9DU1JKc0FsejRyK2lzYWQxS0) and [answers to frequently asked questions](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v2/gp0KBPve2pT~/YVZkZWlUQ0VaTW5GcEYyQWNQeDFXbmx4SnVmZkFEakh3MEdTNko4ZmpiYzhreWdCazFxK0wzaDN4NHNPbzdUYlJhNXdlcUNqSHRFTHQ1Q2hnbUxaZG11dCs5ZUVwek10dFVaRDVSUXJoTzA9S0/NXhvZmVqRkxtOFlEOThyV21qSWdCcWVJdVhJRkUwNWZpVFlUTDFXWnB3aGhVeDZpaEJoT3M5QUpvNjg3S2g3cmRzcUdXZmNjQ2lrSDVoWi9DU1JKc0FsejRyK2lzYWQxS0) for more information.

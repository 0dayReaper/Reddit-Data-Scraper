    "postText": "Hi - are there any SFS undergrads or current students that can help answer these questions?  my son got accepted into the SFS program.  Since our household income doesn't qualify him to get any sort of grant, we'll likely be paying the full price, which can be closer to $80/year. It's a lot of money for us, but if he can recoup the money I am all good. \n\nCan someone tell me what is the starting salary for SFS grads and what roles do they typically apply for?  Also, I know not all fields will pay big bucks right after graduation, which is fine  if there are growth opportunities and one can recoup the investment in a few years time, that's fine as well. I know education is all about self growth, but as someone who has to pay the full fee, I  am also concerned he may need another Master's degree to really make it.",

Each are tried and true methodologies to make over $100k &lt;3 years after graduation.\n\nI know of at least one datapoint of people that make &gt;$300k &lt;5 years after graduation.\n\nWhat will determine ROI is your ability to guide your child into a lucrative profession.",

Because of my ex husband\u2019s assets my D did not qualify for any aid (only about 6500 in sub\u2019d loan + work study.) Like you, we are looking at over 80K/yr. My D would have to take out loans to cover the balance of her father\u2019s EFC and it will be a real stretch (likely second job or parent loan) for me to cover my EFC x 4 years. She was offered a full ride at another Jesuit university, but her career goal is foreign policy/foreign service in some form, which makes it very difficult to turn away from SFS which affords so many unique learning opportunities that either don\u2019t exist or are less regular/routine elsewhere.\nThese reports might be useful to you: https://careercenter.georgetown.edu/about-us/senior-survey-outcomes/",

I know a few that work for the big 4s, all of them consultant in either accounting or IT related (cloud transformation) or healthcare related area.  None in foreign services/policy related area.  Are you saying to make more money you will need to pivot from your area of study?",

These are super common in DC. \n\nThere\u2019s also the federal government, namely State and various security focused agencies. Congress would likely have opportunity as well.",

Furnishings are pretty cheap but not too bad. Each bedroom has full size bed. Bedrooms in 4 bedroom unit pretty small. All utilities plus internet included. Shuttle to main campus takes about 30 minutes. Another shuttle for grocery shopping and rides to union station. Shuttle for campus stops at downtown campus. Communal kitchen on each floor for get togethers. Study areas and gym. Secure building with security desk in front of main door. 55 H Street NW. It's not ideal but it's not bad either.\n\nI should mention grocery shuttle runs only on weekends I believe. Shuttle to union Station stops running at 10pm but it's on demand when it's running. Call them and they will come to union station and pick you up.\n\nAlso 4 bedroom rent is $1500 and you don't have to deal with a separate landlord.",

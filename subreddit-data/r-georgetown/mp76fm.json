    "postText": "RD admit here and Georgetown is one of my top choices along with PPE at Penn CAS. I was wondering what the general culture is like amongst SFS students and I guess Georgetown in general \u2014 is it cutthroat, competitive, and/or pre professional? Also, how does SFS stack up against the Ivies in terms of jobs and opportunities in consulting or finance? What have y'all enjoyed most about your SFS education? Thanks so much!",

The recruitment for those fields, from what I\u2019ve read, is a step below penn but on par with or even above many of the Ivies.  I\u2019m not an SFS student but have heaps of friends through the IRC which has been a real blast and really been enjoying it.",

Just mildly disinterested in each other maybe.\n\nI think the existence of the curve might alter people\u2019s perceptions of each other, but if they weren\u2019t heartless going in they won\u2019t change overnight lol.",

It can get competitive when it comes to specific programmes or internships. But overall it is a combination of specialisation and a culture of extremely high amounts of work",

Check Cawley's website for the employment data and you'll see year over year where they end up. Deloitte hires the most, followed by McKinsey, BCG, then Bain. Last year was a little lower in consulting overall because not being on campus lessened the peer pressure and FOMO that typically comes from seeing your friends get sucked into the consulting recruitment cycle and some of the firms (Bain and BCG specifically) reported about 42% fewer applications for summer 2021 internships from Georgetown.",

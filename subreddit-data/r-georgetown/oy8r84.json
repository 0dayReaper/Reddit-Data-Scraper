    "postText": "Saw my dorm assignment just now, Harbin. But I saw from room tours that the rooms are super small. Can't even put the two beds farther from each other. You have to put them either closely side by side or bunked. The other dorms seem bigger (eg. New South). So why do many say Harbin's the best?",

            "comment": "I have never heard of Harbin being the best, it is definitely at par for the freshmen dorms (traditionally). Darnall was regarded as the worst and New South was the best, then VCW was about the same tier as Harbin, but you got your own bathrooms. With Copley and Reynolds in play now, I would say Copley is pretty high up because of the jack and jill bathroom concept and Reynolds due to largest actual rooms. But you will be fine wherever you end up and you'll make friends regardless. Fun fact is that Bill Clinton was in Harbin!",

            "comment": "Because it\u2019s not Darnall. \n\nShower drains = aren\u2019t even screwed in. \n\nBathroom and shower floors = covered in tissues, fiber, gum, snot, and god knows what else I saw. \n\nShowers = ancient as hell; whenever someone flushed genuinely hot SCOLDING hot and then ICE cold... I literally have physical scars from this. \n\nToilet paper holder slidey thing (to displace to reveal second roll in holder) = gets STUCK af... pushed with all my night trying to get some damn TP and it snaps and it\u2019s plastic but SHARP cause I got a huge gash about a full CM in width down the entire length of my arm and got blood everywhere. Oh, and a scar. LOL. \n\nBathroom cleaning = once a WEEK. That is just unacceptable. \n\nStalls = dirty as hell; pubes everywhere; vomiting past 12 am commonplace. \n\nBathroom cleaning staff = RUDE as hell, literally almost pissed my pants because one wouldn\u2019t let me use the bathroom while she cleaned other stalls AFTER she had already cleaned a bunch. Had to go down a floor and was in a rush... The floor plan is inverted so I went the same way as I normally would but ended up in the women\u2019s restroom (I\u2019m a guy). Once I realized what the tampon disposal things were and the differently colored floor, it hit me. No sign at the time telling me! Exited the other side and saw one. Got red. Thankfully no one saw me. \n\nJanitors = live in the closet (literally, Darnall 6 maintenance closet across 618, comes out at ~4-5 am to call his mother or SO or something). \n\nWashing machines = LOCK no matter WHAT you do (unplug, pull HARD, kick the shit out of, etc.). Amateur at doing laundry, I fill it too much. Door half closes, but still locks. Floods everywhere (it was 3 am when I did this too btw). Kick the shit out of the machine, no dice. I almost smashed it with a rod so I could get my clothes out before unplugging the machine to stop the water flow. Another time, i forgot the detergent. Yep... had to wait 60 mins just to redo it. \n\nElevator on 6th floor = literally take SIX full minutes (timed) before classes, meaning countless people were late due to second guessing taking the stairs or waiting. \n\nI think there was a flooding in the bathroom upstrairs before, but this was before my time there. \n\nGrand finale:  \nWindows = tamper proof. Yet they turn the AC off in like a MONTH after school starts; it was still hot AF! I broke the window tamper (it\u2019s a tamper-proof Torx, I broke with a flathead). Window has no safety mechanism. Opened toward me like a hatch. Nice and cool... Need to pee, so I put the window up. Come back from bathroom, shut door. Vibrations cause window to open and SMASH!!! Glass EVERYWHERE! This was at like 3 am. Genuinely thought security would come investigate because it was so LOUD. Luckily no one seemed to notice minus a few people woken up. Thankfully they happened to be changing all the windows on that floor that week, so I didn\u2019t have to pay anything LOL. This one was def my fault unlike the others here but just needed to say.\n\nThere are some even worse things I did I\u2019m not proud of, but that\u2019s where I\u2019ll cut my losses.",

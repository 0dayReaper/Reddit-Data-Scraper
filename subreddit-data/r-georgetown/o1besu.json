    "postText": "My son is interested in exploring Georgetown however the on campus tours being offered (due to CoVID) are super limited.  Our family is fully vaccinated and I'm looking to \"life hack\" this  a bit.  I do **not** want to violate any rules... my thinking is that having someone to just point out buildings and talk a bit about your experience would be really helpful.\n\nIf you are a current (or recent) undergrad who's interested in being hired for a couple of hours + lunch would you kindly PM me?  We will be in DC roughly July 3-5th.\n\nThanks!",

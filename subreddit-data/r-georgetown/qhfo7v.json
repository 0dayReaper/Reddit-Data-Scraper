    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m in the process of applying for the Masters in Applied Intelligence at SCS. I have a few questions:\n\n1. For those currently (or previously) in the program, what are your honest opinions on it? \n\n2. How are the job prospects after completing the program? For those who have done the program, did it help you in getting a position within the federal government (IC, national security related, defense etc.) or private companies (Accenture, Booze Allen, Deloitte, etc)?\n\n3. How did you pay the tuition for the program? Loans? Scholarships? Out-of-pocket? Did Georgetown provide any merit scholarships?\n\n4. Is the course load manageable while working a full time job?\n\n5. Were you able to network with professors and students? For those who did it online, was it difficult to form connections and network with other students and faculty?\n\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "Ok, I'm in the program right now. \n\n1. I think it's decent, but I don't have much to compare it to. I'm sure you've noticed like I did that there aren't a *ton* of intelligence master's programs out there. So GT is probably the premier in terms of reputation.\n2. I'm still mid way though the program, I'm already in the IC  so I don't know how much value the program has on its own.\n3. I fortunate that I have the ability to pay out of pocket. I will use my GI bill for the second half of the program.\n4. The program offers courses in 15 week online formats, and 7 week accelerated formats. Taking accelerated courses on either end of each semester I am able to take two classes a semester while only technically taking one at a time. It's manageable working a 40+ hour per week job. I typically have 1-2 hours of work per night.\n5. You can network. My experience has been fully online though, you'd get a lot more from being in person. Each class starts out with video introductions, but you can only get some much out of an online format.  For me it's definitely hard to see other students in the online classes as anything other than faces I have to post responses to, to get a good grade.\n\nPM me with any specific questions.",

I\u2019m paying out of pocket but scholarships and financial aid may be available to you.\n\n4. Work load is flexible and manageable. Lots of people have demanding full time jobs. \n\n5.

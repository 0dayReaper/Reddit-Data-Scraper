    "postText": "Hello! I'm an aspiring undergrad applicant to Georgetown. I appreciate the statistics I've seen about the racial diversity at GU, but I am a little concerned about the supposed wealth divide. I attend a public high school in a fairly impoverished city, and I work a job to help support myself. Do you think I'll feel ostracized in a community where a lot of students come from private schools or well-established families? Thank you!",

            "comment": "I didn\u2019t come from an impoverished city, but I did go to a public high school and was in a lower middle class situation for most of my childhood and I have a split family. It was a bit of a culture shock for me to see how many extremely wealthy people are at Georgetown. Many of the students paid more for their private high school educations than I can even afford to pay for my undergraduate education without going into considerable debt. \n\nBefore transferring to Georgetown, I was warned that all these rich kids would be snobby and I might not have a good time. Thus far, I can say that is absolutely not the case. I attended 3 very different colleges in 2 years before finally attending Georgetown (long story lol), and I can say with certainty that Georgetown has the nicest and most genuine people out of any college I\u2019ve attended. I may not relate much with some of their upbringings, but the community is truly fantastic. I\u2019ve made many great friends in the short time that I\u2019ve had on campus thus far. While there can be a bit of elitism in the culture, snobbishness is widely the exception and not the norm. The only times it\u2019s been awkward for me so far is with food. Some of my wealthier friends eat out a lot, often at expensive restaurants, and I\u2019ll have to make up an excuse because I know I just can\u2019t afford it. Besides that, I\u2019ve had an awesome experience and am very happy with my decision to go to Georgetown, online education aside. Hope this helps!",

                    "comment": "Adding on to this, the nature of being in college at a place like Georgetown is somewhat, though not completely, equalizing. Everyone lives in the same dorms, at least for 3/4 years, access to university resources tends to be either open to all or merit-based, many organizations and departments have additional scholarships to pay for certain costs. Yes, you can see who tends to have a bit more or less money, but the playing field is a little bit less unlevel.",

I should have clarified that I don't believe that how much money you have determines how good of a person you are, I was more just scared of not feeling like I fit in. That's a really helpful answer though, I'm getting more and more excited about applying EA!",

To give you the complete and honest truth it really depends who you surround yourself around. I have made friends from a wide array of socioeconomic, ethnic, and religious backgrounds. I\u2019m not going to lie, I a have definitely made friends with the douchebags you fret, however, I truly believe that there is so much diversity and a place for everyone on the hilltop. Transferring to Georgetown has undoubtedly been the best decision of my entire life",

I transferred from a prominent state school where everyone seemed to have an ego to themselves. Ive been talking to people just like I would back home and come to find out a month later their dad owns some billion dollar company and I am quickly brought back to the reality of who makes up the student body. They're normal people just like me and you, you'll have some people that are privileged for sure but I felt like everyone so far has been outstanding",

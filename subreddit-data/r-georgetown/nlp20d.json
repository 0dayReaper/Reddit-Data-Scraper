The things they go after are jokes at our culture and shouldn't be taken so seriously like \"Don't use the S-word\" for stuffed. That's funny, move on with yourself if you get so worked up over a trivial joke.\n\nI also don't *generally* find demographic inequality arguments too convincing for stuff like this. The Chunky Panda group was probably started by a group friends, you can't always generate friend groups that represent the proportion of the student body. Also, people may just have different interests. The Hoya is like 80% white women for god's sake, idk about the Voice, this doesn't make any of them racist. Guarantee if you did an audit of all clubs at Georgetown they the vast majority wouldn't fit the demographic representation just due to different interests. \n\nAs for the Autism Speaks, I can understand some frustration there, but at the end of the day it isn't like a \"killing puppies\" org, just preference for charity and orientation of support. I think the sentiment is probably genuinely positive. \n\nChunky is fine, I don't really care one way or another about him, but these are arguments just for argument sake and lack much substance.

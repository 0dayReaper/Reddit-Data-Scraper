I'm a lot busier than I was in undergrad, and I rarely have time to take a day off (not even weekends!). \n\nYou're able to get involved on campus if you'd like, but the onus for doing so is on you. Everyone else around you is just as busy as you are, so the graduate student organizations are far less engaged with the campus community than undergrad orgs are. \n\nPersonally, I don't feel super connected to campus due to how busy I am, but that's because I live in the grad student housing in NoMa that u/dolphinsonsaturn mentioned. It's a 30-minute commute because the school provides a GUTS bus, though, so it's easy enough to get there.\n\nIt depends so much on your program and your reasons for coming to grad school. It's definitely a different experience than if you were an undergrad at Georgetown, though.",

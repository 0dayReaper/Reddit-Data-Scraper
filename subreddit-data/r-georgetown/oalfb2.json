    "postText": "Incoming grad student here. I am moving from Minneapolis to DC at the end of July, and am looking for a place to stay near the medical campus. I have been looking on Craigslist and Georgetown's housing page for possible places, but just wanted to hear from students directly.\n\nWhat are some good neighborhoods to live in that are within 2 miles or so of campus (I plan to mostly bike to/from class)? Are there any areas/neighborhoods to specifically avoid? I would ideally be looking for a studio less than $1,400/month. Any input is appreciated!",

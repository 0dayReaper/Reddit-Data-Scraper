    "postText": "I am a rising senior and am currently crafting my college list. Georgetown has been my top choice for awhile, but do any current students know of any big pros and cons I should know about before applying? I would be applying as an English lit or a psych major and going either pre med or pre law.",

            "comment": "I can't speak for psych or pre law, but the English program is one of the most highly regarded in the country and the pre med courses are well structured and well taught. I was not premed but was a biology major so I took most of them. However, academics are good across the board and, like anywhere else, Georgetown has some professors you should try to take and some you should avoid. So you should think more about factors outside of the classroom imo, especially if you are not dead-set on one path. \n\nFor me the biggest pros were that Georgetown is in a major city but has an actual campus, several different libraries/study spaces, a lot of different clubs and outlets to explore new interests, a D1 basketball team that finally seems to be on the up (we sucked during my 4 yers:/), and a lot of interesting opportunities to do service and social justice work. The core requirements can be a bit much, but I also got to take some really cool art and music classes that I would have ignored otherwise and I am really glad I did\n\nThe cons for me were that while in a major city, its location is somewhat inconvenient to get to the metro and a lot of students end up not leaving the \"georgetown bubble\" much. I also had somewhat of a culture shock and felt out of place for a while coming from a pretty modest background. This one is a nitpick but it always annoyed me that the basketball games are kinda far from campus which leaves stands kinda empty for weekday games or lower profile ones. Sometimes it also felt like the general attitude valued being busy and involved with a bunch of stuff over enjoying what you were interested in and some of the bigger clubs/organizations were weirdly insular. Also a lot of people complain about the dorms and dining hall but I thought they were fine.\n\nI don't know what you value or what you are looking for and this is just my subjective, PERSONAL experience and it is not universal. My outlook on my time there is positive but a mixed bag so take it with a grain of salt if the cons sound too bad or the pros don't sound good enough. I will say that if you are either somewhat outgoing or very passionate about a few things and the idea of having a more classic campus life while still being in a city sounds appealing to you, then you will probably like it overall. DC is also very cool in general and I am glad I was there as opposed to a bigger city or a small college city.",

Overall I would try to get scholarships or have a way for your schooling to be paid for if you choose Georgetown.",

It feels like if you want something enough coming from Georgetown, you can go get it. Since it seems like you're still deciding on your academic and career goals, that would be a good thing.",

If GU med or law is your dream school and you'd never go anywhere else though they're great. \n\nTo be fair med school is probably a bit more of a plus given how tough that application process is.",

Also the area the campus is in is beautiful. Cons - probably going to have to uber everywhere if you want to get off campus bc no metro.\n\nReally great school and worth it.",

There was a huge line to see Hilary Clinton the other day. If you're in certain clubs you may get reserved seats at the event (e.g. if you're on the board for Georgetown Democrats you may not have to wait in line to see Elizabeth Warren).",

People belonging to the boards of certain clubs(College Democrats/Republicans and GU Politics) get priority access, are the ones who ask the most questions, and also get a higher chance of obtaining photos with the speakers though.",

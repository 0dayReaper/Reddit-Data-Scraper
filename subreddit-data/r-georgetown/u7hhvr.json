Every freshman not in Darnall(the farthest removed one) brags about their rooms regularly, and all(except Darnall) have great locations. \nDining is a pretty contested topic; downstairs Leo\u2019s will generally have something or the other to get you to your next meal, but you also always have other options like Royal Jacket or upstairs Leo\u2019s. People tend to be cynical about it due to some past incidents, but I think the food isn\u2019t always so bad except on holidays when most people go away anyway",

It\u2019s really close to the Leavey center and since freshmen are required to use the meal plan it\u2019s super convenient since I think the salads at Crop Chop in Leavey are significantly better than an Leo\u2019s. Also! Living in Darnall, you\u2019re a 10 minute walk from Trader Joe\u2019s AND you\u2019re really close to the nature trail in the residential neighborhood if you like going for walks. However, the lunch and din we food at Leo\u2019s is, in my opinion, nutritionally abysmal (breakfast isn\u2019t bad). Also the bathroom situation in Darnall isn\u2019t great but you get used to it after a while and it\u2019s stopped bothering me (honestly same w the food quality at Leo\u2019s).",

I\u2019d say they\u2019re about average as far as college goes, and not nearly as bad as everyone seems to make them out to be. \n\nFood is alright, too. Downstairs Leo\u2019s will generally have at least something you\u2019ll like on a day-to-day basis, and there are more than enough spots on or near campus (big Wisemiller\u2019s fan myself) to keep you from going hungry.",

The freshman dorms can be questionable and have facility problems depending on which one you live in... I'd personally recommend selecting a \"single gender floor\" housing since single gender floors are only in the nicer housing buildings. Dining is pretty meh tbh, I'd avoid the downstairs all you can eat and get food from the other locations on campus.",

Maybe there was some mandatory stuff you had to do but I don't remember exactly...if anything, you get to live in a decent upperclassman dorm.\nIt can also be a good way to make new friends cause all the people in a LLC live on the same floor and hang out together a lot.",

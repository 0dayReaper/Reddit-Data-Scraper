    "postText": "I am a visiting student taking summer classes in person. On GU's official website only the law route has summer-specific information, but I am curious about the Arlington and Rosslyn routes. As far as I could gather, they operate on weekdays but there is also a statement on how \"normal schedule returns on August 2nd\". I'm just not sure what that refers to and if I need to find an alternative transportation method - looking into this right now because I somehow have been assuming that they do operate as normal but am not so sure anymore judging by the wording. \n\nOn that note, if they do operate to any extent, is there a way to track the shuttles? \n\nThanks!",

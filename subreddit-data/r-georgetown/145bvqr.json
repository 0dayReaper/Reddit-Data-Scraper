Look, I get that the way we teach these things sometimes really sucks, but do yourself a favor and try to unfix some biases. If you\u2019ve decided part of your personality is that you \u201cheavily dislike STEM\u201d before being exposed to any college level STEM, it\u2019s going to be a rough lifetime for you.",

But please DM me if you have any desire to discuss this more. I really just wish that more people had fewer biases against STEM coming into the University setting for the first time, and I really have a tough time understanding why people decide they don\u2019t like the technical study of the world. If we want to save our planet, this is important.",

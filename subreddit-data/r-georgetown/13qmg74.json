I really have no clue what I want to do and that\u2019s probably okay right now, but I want to keep my options open between policy, pre-med, and pre-law! Yeah I suck lol I\u2019m indecisive, but wondering how doable the HCMP track with premed classes like gen/org chem, bio, biochem as core/electives throughout will be. Otherwise, I could attempt to transfer into the SFS with STIA as my major and still take pre-med classes. Alternative is human sciences but take the policy classes as electives, but I heard human science is notoriously difficult compared to anything else at GU. If anyone has done smth like this before, please give feedback!",

            "comment": "Hi there! I'm a rising Human Science senior and I think I can give you a bit of insight into what you're asking.   \n\n\nIf you're leaning towards pre-med, I would 100% recommend majoring in Human Science. The major is really well designed for pre-med students, covering all the core classes you'll need. However, it's worth noting that it is indeed quite heavy on the sciences, as you've heard.Avoiding the language requirement and less focus on ecology are some perks, not to mention the smaller class sizes which offer a lot of one-on-one interaction with professors and lots of research opportunities.   \n\n\nHowever, if you're interested in keeping the door open to policy or pre-law, it might be worth exploring options that allow you to balance a mix of courses.The HCMP and Global Health majors within the SOH, for instance, might give you a slightly less science-heavy schedule per semester, which could free up room to take electives in areas like policy or law, depending on your interests.  \n\n\nOn the other hand, if you're considering transferring into SFS with STIA, remember to assess the requirements and the workload of the program too. Remember, it's all about finding the balance that works for you and your future goals.  \n\n\nNo matter what, though, being indecisive is perfectly okay at this stage! College is a time for exploration, and you're thinking about your options, which is the most important thing. Best of luck!",

I\u2019m leaning into starting my first year with HCMP and taking gen chem and physics the whole year as elective slots, since I just finished those. That way I can switch into human sciences if premed is still viable by sophomore year. It\u2019s super helpful to hear from someone who\u2019s done the exact thing I\u2019m looking into",

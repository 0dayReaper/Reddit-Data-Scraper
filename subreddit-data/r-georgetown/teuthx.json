Some people do it in the school year, some people do it in the summer. In the school year, you\u2019ll need to arrange your class schedule carefully to make time for an internship.\n\nYes you are allowed to do it freshman year, but I would suggest waiting till at least the Spring to have time to adjust to college.\n\nThis applies to everyone at Georgetown, regardless of major.",

I didn\u2019t go to Georgetown for undergrad but at my undergrad the biology major had an internship course for 3 credit hours. At my school you just had to talk with the department and get your internship approved then make sure your supervisor has a way to sign off on your hours that would verify the time spent.\n\nI don\u2019t see why a school like Georgetown would not have the same. It could be major specific but uhh you must certainly can get an internship to count for some credit. Not always but also it isn\u2019t a never. Also sometimes there are on campus Internships that can count for credit \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

The majority of internships at GU undergrad, at least in the Gov program, will not result in college credit and even those that do will only result in 1 credit regardless of whether it is 15,20,25+ hours a week you are working.",

It\u2019s good for freshman to know that if they plan to do an internship anyway they can also use it to have one less credit hour to worry about. Your never know could save them from taking a dumb seminar class to fill up time",

    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming student planning to be a pre-med in the college. I was wondering if it would be too difficult to take both foundation courses for biology and chemistry in addition to three core requirement classes, or if I should stick to two core classes so as not to overwhelm myself? For biochem majors, the website states that taking a fifth class is really optional, but am worried if I don't I will not have a rigorous enough schedule. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!",

You will want time to make relationships with peers and professors, pursue extracurriculars, etc. When it comes to your success after graduation your personal network and resume of jobs/internships/clubs/anything will be really important.",

They are time consuming not just assignment-wise or content-wise, but adjustment-wise in new ways of learning and studying. If you want to take 5 courses, do it spring semester after you\u2019ve adjusted a bit and made friends (esp from these courses).",

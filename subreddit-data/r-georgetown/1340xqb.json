I am currently wrapping up my undergraduate studies, no professional industry experience - is anyone else pursuing an MPS in this school straight out of undergrad, if so how has it helped you launch your career? Do most mps students also work full-time while pursuing their masters?",

            "comment": "I did my MPS at georgetown after having been working full time for like 4 years. But there were always people in my classes who were in the program straight out of undergrad. Honestly I don't think SCS programs are meant for folks who aren't simultaneously working, or at least most people in my program were still working full time jobs including myself. I knew like 2 people that were only working part time jobs and only maybe another 2 or 3 that were doing the program full time. \n\nAll my classmates who I connected with found some really nice jobs around or shortly after graduating. For me, it was a necessary step to move out of the coordinator level in my career, and you have to have a masters degree to do so, so it really helped me. I wouldn't be in my current job without it.",

I graduated last year with a minor in Cybersecurity and wanted to expand my career into this field through this degree. I currently work full time in IT but not related to a cyber security role. Many of my classmates are also working as well with various types of backgrounds, some very technical and others who are trying to make a career switch.",

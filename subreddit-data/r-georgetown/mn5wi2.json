    "postText": "I\u2019m a RD admit and am seriously considering attending Georgetown. I originally applied to the college but have always had a flare for foreign policy and am considering switching to SFS. However, I have very minimal experience with foreign policy (I\u2019m in a high level Spanish course and have taken only one high-school class that was related to foreign policy) and my family is not super political. Subsequently, I\u2019m not sure I want to 100% commit to something I don\u2019t know that much about. \n\nSo, here\u2019s my question: Does attending SFS lead to very specific, specialized jobs (an analogy is like a how the nursing school only produces nurses or ppl in the medical field) or are the degrees earned from SFS a bit more versatile?\n\nAlso, what kind of experience/knowledge base do students at SFS usually have? Would I be a fish out of water considering I don\u2019t know a whole lot? Or is everyone kind of clueless and starting from scratch?",

Although most of my friends who graduated from SFS still went into either law or management consulting, some of them are doing some really cool-ass shit, like microfinance in LatAm and diplomacy in Turkey.  \n\n2) Inevitably, there will be a few Model UN kids who know an absolute shitload about world affairs the moment they step foot on campus. Don't be intimidated. First, that knowledge is generally pretty superficial and not super useful in the classroom. Second, you can pick it up pretty quickly by reading the international sections of The Economist magazine, which Georgetown should have a subscription to.",

Most consider it as a stepping stone to going into the Foreign Service itself, though no level of College is required and the education you get wont necessarily make the process for that any easier.  the major benefit is the connections adn resources you make that can help you prepare for the FSOT, the PEQ and the FSOA.\n\nOther related fields that the SFS and MSFS degree's can help you with are places like NGO's, and other international businesses like the World bank, Goldman Sachs etc.\n\nUnderstanding how to negotiate and work with international entities both government and business is a critical skill for many international corporations.\n\nat the end of the day a degree in SFS or MSFS is much the same as any other degree.  is it your passcode into the field you want?  no, but it can prepare you and give you the tools you need to get into those fields.",

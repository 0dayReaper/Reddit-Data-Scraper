However, the law school provides a lot of funds overall - depending on your financial picture, you may qualify for some form of aid.\n\nTo be frank, the cost of living in DC is high and the law school is expensive. If you are looking for value, you may want look elsewhere. While we host a premiere law school, the price tag is also premium.",

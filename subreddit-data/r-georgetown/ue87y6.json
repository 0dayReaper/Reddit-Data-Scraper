    "postText": "Has anyone lived (or know someone who lived) at the Gewirz dorm on the law campus? It seems to be pretty cheap compared to most DC apartments, but I'm a little apprehensive about living in a dorm again after undergrad. I've found very little honest info about it online so any thoughts would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "I lived in Gewirz 1L. Its not cheap definitely, but for the area it's a competitive price. I lived on the fourth floor in an efficiency double. Overall I would say it was a great place to live 1L. Being so close to class buildings removed a lot of stress and allowed me to focus more on studying because I didn't have a commute to worry about. That said, I will warn you that the building is quite old and has some issues. Though I never experienced it myself, some people were without hot water for a while and recently there has been some pest problems. \n\nDespite some issues, I dont regret living in Gewirz. I am not someone who is very picky about living conditions and having my own bedroom was a luxury I did not have in undergrad. Although some of my friends who have much higher standards for housing found it lacking.\n\nIt's about the same price as all the apartments on Mass ave that a lot of people live at, and you only make rent payments once a semester. Capital Plaza is the only building in the area that I would say is cheaper while still being very close to campus, but Ive heard that building has its own problems.\n\nHope this helps",

This makes a lot more sense when I hear that you can find cheaper options off campus. I've mostly been using apartments.com and the Georgetown housing portal for finding places, if you (or anyone) has any other tips for finding relatively affordable housing in the area I'd love to hear them!",

Currently Im in a row house in Truxton Circle, which is probably one of the more affordable neighborhoods near GULC, but I wouldn't recommend it for 1L just because you wont be as familiar with the area.",

    "postText": "Honestly, I didn't expect to feel bad about this, but I kind of do, especially hearing my friends get in. It feels a bit like college admissions all over again lol. Any words of advice? Also I got a 2nd interview w the Blue and Gray but was then cut (just got the notification). Has anyone ever gotten in their freshman spring? If so, what changed? Thanks you guys.",

Most clubs don\u2019t have strict entry requirements or interview processes - just because you didn\u2019t get into one of the Big Four doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have fun and make an impact on campus (or have something to write on your resume). \n\nAlso, remember you\u2019ve got four years in college. The people you hang out with in freshman fall likely won\u2019t remain your only or even closest friend group all the way until graduation. Keep your head up and keep trying - it\u2019s difficult for everyone to break into new things right now.",

As you noted, it really doesn\u2019t matter and you can absolutely enjoy a vibrant social life at Georgetown without ever knowing or caring about this stuff. Affinity groups like BSU, AASA, and LASA, or interest-based groups like GUGS, GU Running Club, or the club sports are often good places to start. SAC organizations in general tend to be much more laid-back and comfortable social spaces anyway (at least in my experience). Good luck, OP.",

There are literally hundreds of clubs that reject no one, and that you can definitely still join *right now*! \n\nThis is not like college admissions. College admissions determines where you will get to live for 4 years and the diploma afterwards, and you mostly only get one shot. Clubs determine a handful of your hours each week and you can apply every semester in most if you want to, and you can still be friends with people even if you're not in that club. \n\nYes you can absolutely re apply to clubs that rejected you as well - it gets easier since older students will only apply to clubs they really want to be in rather than just shooting their shot at everything their friends are. Also, you'll know people in those clubs who can help you out.",

Outside of that, there is an expectation of coming in about another 3-4 hours a week to make sure you finish your projects on time",

It takes six courses to minor in art, and ten to major in art. \nMy Design 1 Professor sucked, but that was luck of the draw. I love my graphic design Professor. Honestly, rate my professor will be your daughter\u2019s best friend for her four years at any school",

            "comment": "It depends on what you want to get a PhD for. We are strong in three general areas:\n1) Data centric computing (AI/Machine learning/Information Retrieval)\n2) Security and Privacy\n3) Theory \nand there is some overlap between areas, for example we are strong in cryptography, which is the intersection of privacy and theory.\n\nGeorgetown as an institution funds PhD students. You get tuition and a stipend guaranteed for five years, I believe, if you are accepted. Currently you don't have to TA as a new PhD student, but that might be changing.\n\nOur PhD students seem to do well. We haven't placed many in academic tenure track positions but many go to industry and make more money than most of the professors.\n\nThe department is growing stronger all the time - we have been hiring many excellent faculty and continue to do so. We have not only the moral support of the administration, but financial support as well.",

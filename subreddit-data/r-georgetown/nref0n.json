    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an incoming freshman who is currently in the process of applying for first year housing.  In the emails I\u2019ve received, one of the housing options mentioned was \u201cLiving Learning Communities.\u201d  I went to the website to learn more about them, but I still have some questions.  Has anyone on this subreddit lived in one of these communities?  If so, did you have a positive or negative experience with them?  Are their dorms supposed to be nicer than normal dorms?  Are there any other benefits or drawbacks to living in these communities?  Thanks for your help!",

Some are mixed grade, which could be a drawback if you want to be around lots of first years. Overall there not that big of a deal other way, you can maybe enjoy somewhat of a community from the better ones but you can definitely have friends outside them.",

    "postText": "Hi! I am an incoming exchange student at GU Law and i am looking for housing. I have some questions:\n\n1. is off-campus or student accommodation recommended? (and why?)\n2. \\^ personally, i am leaning towards looking for off campus housing because it might be more economical. is anyone else looking for flat/room-mates? (or is there a platform where i can find other potential flat/roommates?)\n3. what are the recommended neighbourhoods?\n\nthanks!",

I've never seen dorms closer to the classrooms at any other school I've attended or visited. If being close to class is important to you, I'd go on campus.\n\nIf you are looking off campus, DC housing can be pretty expensive. When I was looking into a place in the city in 2018, I was looking at $2k for a studio apartment. If saving money is important to you, I would try to find a place off campus and outside of downtown DC, but close to a metro line. The law center is right on the red line and right by union station.",

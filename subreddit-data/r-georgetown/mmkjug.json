    "postText": "hi everyone! i\u2019ve recently been admitted to the college as undeclared, but am heavily thinking about declaring an environmental biology major later on. can anyone describe what their experience with this major has been like? for example, how big is the department, what have you been able to specialize in over time, what opportunities unique to georgetown have you gotten to take advantage of, what are the faculty like, what is it like being a part of a smaller major (i\u2019m assuming), study abroad, etc.? \n\nim really having a hard time deciding between georgetown and a school known for its agricultural/environmental work. the only thing really holding me back from georgetown is the fact that they only offer one environment-related major. \n\nthank you so much for your time! i hope this obeys the subreddit guidelines, idk if this counts as talking about admissions.",

            "comment": "You would actually be a biology major entering. Then sophomore year you choose among the four bio majors: biology, biology of global health, environmental biology, and neurobiology. \n\nBGH is the biggest, followed by bio. EBio and Neuro are both very small.\n\nThe bio department as a whole is very wholesome. Professors are very friendly and approachable, and there are lots of great opportunities for research.\n\nThere are lots of opportunities for study abroad at Georgetown. Also, many bio professors do research abroad (e.g. dolphin ecology research in Australia or something) and undergrads can spend the summer abroad doing research like that if you find the right lab to join.",

                            "comment": "There are a good group of Ebio profs, but by far Ebio is the least popular biology major. Many biology students are premeds and don't want to study ecology in depth or you have people interested in health policy, grad school in more molecular/cellular biology, or neuro. Coming into the university, you will have nearly 100 biology majors in your class. This stays the same for all of freshman year, but this breaks down as you join your respective biology sub-majors as you enter your first and second semesters of sophomore year. \n\nI think the smaller classes and closer relationships with profs at higher levels is super appealing. Great way to get to know profs in joining their labs, getting recommendations, etc... and as the person said above, there are a lot of cool study abroads and field work you can do. You are going to a small school and this is actually one of the benefits of a small school.",

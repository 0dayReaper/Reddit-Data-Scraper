Everyone is not vaccinated - there are medical and religious exemptions allowed. So, it is up to those individuals to follow protocol, mask up, and get tested regularly. The framework is in place for this to happen, though, and people seem to be abiding by those guidelines.\n\nThe larger concern, IMO, is wild card factor of the delta variant and other variants that could render the vaccines ineffective. It is a dynamic situation, so campus status may change accordingly. If infection rates skyrocket, it would not make sense to keep everyone around to fester and spread the virus.",

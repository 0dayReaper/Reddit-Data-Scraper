You have to live on campus (or be abroad) for 3 years, senior year you can go off campus. What makes the dorms worth it are not the facilities but the people who live in them, who you'll get to know better because you're...living on campus.",

Columbia and U Chicago are similarly dense, but it's common for people on non-University business to just be driving through campus.  At UNC, UMD, and the like, you'll find closed-off spots that are are big as Georgetown, but not as dense --   they're so sprawling that you can go 4 years without ever setting foot on certain parts of campus.  Georgetown's layout makes the whole campus feel like a single community.",

            "comment": "dorms suck everywhere. i will say campus food isnt good straight up, but the price per meal is about the same as eating out (13 bucks im p sure) so once u get rly bored of campus food (end of freshman year) youll be a sophomore and you can just eat out and stuff and it wont uniquely hurt your wallet. its all fine though its not like uniquely worse than other schools. that said, i imagine the only schools that can compete with us academically on international relations are princeton, harvard, yale, and stanford and other than harvard all of their dorms and stuff are insanely nice lol. i guess my point is if the best school you get is georgetown (no hyps), the dorms will prob be comparable to other schools you get into. if you get into hyps, i imagine youll take em over gu and their dorms happen to be better anyways lol.",

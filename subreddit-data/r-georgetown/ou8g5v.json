    "postText": "Hi everyone! As the title states, I have been on the job hunt for a few months now without success landing a job. I'm looking for your advice and thoughts.\n\nI\u2019ve been focused on the consulting, think tank, and government fields, applying to jobs throughout the academic year (and weathering consulting recruitment in the fall). I have been to interviews, particularly in consulting, but I have been unable to reach the final stage in many cases (even this summer). I\u2019ve maintained communication with the career center for resume/cover letter/application assistance; at one point I was told that it would take as long as six months to receive an offer. I\u2019ve been applying to jobs on platforms like Handshake, USAjobs, Daybook, and Linkedin, and I\u2019ve been trying to network with alumni on Linkedin.\n\nIf I may ask, do any alums have any advice for me? What should I expect in terms of the job hunt right now? Anecdotally, I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s been quite difficult for new grads to land jobs in D.C. right now.\n\nFor reference, I graduated from the SFS in May, having studied IPEC/IECO with a 3.5+ GPA. I have primarily government internship experience and campus consulting (GGC, Innovo, etc.) experience featured on my resume.",

            "comment": "LinkedIn is good but in my experience the best networking comes through people you already know. Call/email/grab coffee with alumni you knew who are now 1-3 years out of school, past internship supervisors, family friends, that kind of thing. \n\nI think there are statistics along the lines of 80% of jobs are found through personal networks.",

I've hesitated reaching out to many in my circles because they didn't quite have the same academic background as I or weren't quite interested in the same industries. Nonetheless, I see the benefits of what you're saying. Thank you for the advice and I'll definitely reach out to more people I knew!",

    "postText": "I was accepted into UChicago's MScA program (online) but came across Georgetown's MS Data Science program. I like the fact that it is in person and part time (I wasn't interested in living in Chicago which is why I chose online for UChicago) but I'm not sure which program I should choose. I think having in person classes and being able to collaborate with classmates is valuable, but I wonder if Chicago's name makes it a stronger option. Any thoughts?",

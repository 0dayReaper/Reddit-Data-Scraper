Village A is decent quality, everything has private bathrooms kitchens and living rooms, interiors were renovated a couple years ago, but the exact amount of space you have will depend on specific unit. IDK about AU. \n\n2. Georgetown is a mix of college students and old rich people so make of that what you will. There's a mix of local restaurants at all price points, search for past reddit posts on this. \n\n3. Yes, it's one of the safest areas of DC. Petty property theft is the most common crime. Use standard precautions.",

I\u2019m not sure what the right hourly amount would be at the university level in a niche subject. I obviously don\u2019t want to gouge them, but I also want to make it worth my while. I\u2019ve heard everything from $25/hr, which seems too low to $100/hr which seems way too high. Does anybody know where the happy medium lies?",

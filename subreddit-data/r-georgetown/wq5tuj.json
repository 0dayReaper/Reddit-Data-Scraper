I am a data science masters student and only study the language in my free time, so I am unsure if I could participate in activities the school has for those majoring in Italian.  But i\u2019d love to get some practice in for CILS in the fall!",

I did this all four semesters I was a graduate student at Georgetown and got to take undergrad-level language courses \u201cfor research purposes.\u201d There were always at least 2-3 other grad students in all of my language classes and it was a good way to meet people outside my department (this might be too big of a time commitment for you, but it\u2019s an option).",

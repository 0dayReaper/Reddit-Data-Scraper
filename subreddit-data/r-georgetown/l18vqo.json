I was thinking of getting a bachelors of science in Foreign service with a major in international economics. \n\nI\u2019m an international student so what kind of career prospects can I expect from this degree? if anyone here has taken such a path or know someone who has please let me know it went. \n\nI am also interested in the law school assured admittance program so how are the career prospects for Georgetown Law school?\n\nThanks!",

(yes I'm old), JP Morgan, McKinsey, Bain, Blackstone, KKR, etc.\n\nMost of folks I know who were IPOL at SFS (myself included) went on to top-10 law schools; I'd say most of us went to top-5 law schools (myself included).  I see no reason why an international econ major with a decent GPA wouldn't have the same opportunities open to them.\n\nNot to be a snob, but frankly if you get a 3.5 or above in SFS Int'l Economics, Georgetown Law is basically a safety school for you.  You'll have ZERO problem getting in, assuming you don't shit the bed on the LSATs.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any questions about SFS --&gt; law school.",

Just absolutely do a Princeton Review/Kaplan/whatever course, and take it seriously. Do tons of timed practice exams (and even more run-throughs of any sections you struggle with, e.g. those tricky ass logic games).\n\nIncidentally, fuck the LSAT. I scraped by with what I\u2019d say was about the lowest score I could get and still get into top-5 schools. Yet I did well in law school, awesome on the bar exam, and I like to think I\u2019m a good lawyer. So like, maybe the lsat isn\u2019t all that great as a measure of success in law school. But it is what it is.",

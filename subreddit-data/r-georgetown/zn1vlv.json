            "comment": "There's no student parking at Georgetown. If you choose to live in Georgetown, they don't do reciprocal street parking, so you'd have to title/register your car with the city for a parking pass (expensive). If she commutes and drives, she might have to pay for a parking spot near the school (less, but also expensive). If she commutes via metro, she'll have to take the GUTS bus from Rosslyn (slow).\n\nIt all sucks, honestly.",

            "comment": "A lot of grad students live in NOVA. Most people I know live in the general Rosslyn/Arlington radius and use the GUTS service to get to campus. It\u2019s not perfect but it gets the job done.\n\nI commute from a little further into NoVa, it\u2019s not too bad. That\u2019s where you\u2019re going to find a little more affordable housing, but that\u2019s offset some by cost of commuting. If that\u2019s not a big deal and you don\u2019t mind a ling commute, you could live deeper into Fairfax county and use the Orange metro line. \n\nI think it really comes down to the balance between housing cost, convenience of being close to campus, and commute time/cost.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m doing undergrad PH and live in NOVA. options here are GUTS bus or city busses. \nthe problem people aren\u2019t getting on this thread is that the GUTS bus drops you nowhere near public health classes. Whichever route you take you\u2019ll have to walk minimum 15 mins, usually i walk 25 and take city bus bc GUTS bus is slow. In the rain and cold this is ass. It also means I leave an hour before class every day. \n\nThe other option is car + parking. She can ask in any group chats if anyone is renting out a spot near St Mary\u2019s or the hospital. I got mine for $175/month. She can also check in City Girls Who Walk DC. \n\nDon\u2019t try to street park, you will hate yourself and the world. (I\u2019ve been hit (&amp;run) twice and it can take me up to 20 mins to find a spot. Plus, most of the parking is 2 hour and some of her classes will be 2h 30m)\n\nOkay my other option is this: the D6 stops near St. Mary\u2019s Hall (the entire PH department works here). If you can find a place along the D6 route, youre golden.\nyou could also try to find a place within walking distance of St Mary\u2019s Hall. That would be in burleith. affordable? lolololol \n\nsorry for the brain dump. hope it\u2019s helpful. feel free to PM.",

            "comment": "Your best options are Burleith, Glover Park, and Northern Virginia. \n\nNoVA is the closest to the metro, but it\u2019s not within reasonable walking distance of Georgetown so you\u2019d have to bike/drive/take the bus. \nA lot of upperclassmen and graduate students live in Burleith because it\u2019s in walking distance of campus, however it has fewer public transport options compared to NoVA. It\u2019s also convenient because it\u2019s closest to the part of campus where the public health classes are held. \nGlover Park is a little farther away than Burleith, but it\u2019s near grocery stores and restaurants. It\u2019s about a 15 minute walk from campus, but you can easily bike in 5 minutes to campus because it\u2019s all downhill. There are capital bike share racks in glover park and on 38th and reservoir, so your Fianc\u00e9 would have that option if she doesn\u2019t want to purchase her own bike.",

            "comment": "All of the aforementioned are great advice. I\u2019ll add my two cents by saying I found success in Cardozo (south of Columbia Heights) with a place for a decent amount when shared with my partner. The public transportation is also workable, though it is inconsistent and you should leave with plenty buffer. Driving in DC, and specifically parking near Georgetown, will be a crapshoot and stressful. You can pay for the parking near St Mary\u2019s or the hospital, but as all things GU - it\u2019ll cost you an arm and a leg.",

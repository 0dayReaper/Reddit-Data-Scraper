    "postText": "Hey guys, I am a student in KCL and i am applying for the spring 2024 term in Georgetown. Part of my application is to list 8 courses i would like to take at Georgetown but i am struggling to grasp which to which courses i am eligible to join, i will be a second year student at that point. So far i have used the 'browse course catalog' but had a hard time understanding the level of each courses. \n\nThus, if anyone can assist me with some questions about the course selection and maybe additional information i might use before sending my application would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks!!!",

            "comment": "The browse courses button is pretty intuitive\u2014filter by the subject(s) that interest you and make sure the level is set to undergraduate. The lower the course number (aka the higher up on the page) the \u2018easier\u2019 the course may be/less requirements and prior knowledge necessary to enroll. I know KCL does a level system 1-7; though we don\u2019t do that over here, anything with a course number 1000-1200 shouldn\u2019t be difficult to enroll in regardless of subject",

Thus, considering that the number of the courses are at the thousands how can i figure out the scope of my eligibility. It is even more bewildering considering this page: [https://studyabroad.georgetown.edu/exchange/exchange-apply/exchange-programs/](https://studyabroad.georgetown.edu/exchange/exchange-apply/exchange-programs/) which explains the appropriate courses by the hundreds not the thousands. Another question that arises is if the year of study is irrelevant when signing to courses at Georgetown?",

If you search up courses under a subject, the first courses you see are the ones that are easiest to register for; just check for course titles that interest you and make sure they don\u2019t have pre-reqs.\nAlso year of study mostly isn\u2019t relevant so long as the course you\u2019re taking does not have any pre-reqs.",

Thanks so much for clarifying this, I hope I haven't misunderstood you. Another question, what are the best courses to take if I plan to go to a law school in the US after completing my degree?",

For example, look into courses like Constitutional Law I or II (GOVT 2231 or 2232), or the First Amendment (GOVT 2233). I would also recommend the intro govt courses if you are unfamiliar with the US legal/political system, as a comprehensive understanding of these is essential for any US law student. These would be GOVT 1200, 1400, 1600, or 1800. You could also look into Business Law (ACCT 1181), although I think this might be restricted to students in the business school and I'm not sure what your major is.",

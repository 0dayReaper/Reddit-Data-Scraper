If you use Google Tasks to keep track of assignments, adding deadlines add this to your calendar :)\n\nYou DO NOT need to join every organization!\n\nDon\u2019t worry about not getting the classes you want, focus on fulfilling your pre-requisites! If you plan to take ECON beyond principles, you need Calculus!\n\nI know college can be a freeing experience and independence is a great feeling, but choose your friends wisely AND definitely ask for help when you need it.",

Clubs are how you get to know most of the on-campus events, besides through your friends!\n- Know your meal plan and options; both downstairs and upstairs Leo\u2019s are always included, as is Royal Jacket in Leavey. The included flex dollars can cover more than you think, from coffees at one of 6 spots on campus to groceries/snacks from Vittles/Bodega/Hoya Snaxa to better food at Epi\u2019s.\n- If you\u2019re planning on getting stuff mailed to campus in the early weeks of move in, it\u2019ll save you some time if you mail it to either a hotel or to a friend in the area; the packaging center gets overwhelmed, and even if your stuff arrives, it can be as much as 2 weeks before you can pick it up (I personally had to wait over 10 days for each of my packages, after they arrived, during the first month of school). If this isn\u2019t an option, make sure you get your student address correct, as this can reduce the chance of your package being lost/delayed!\n- Every students says you should attend office hours; I think you should definitely do it as much as you justifiably can. Any question or concern you have are easily addressed since so many people seem to skip out on them.\n- Adding onto the previous, if a class has recitations, even if you feel confident, always attend them! You\u2019ll find a lot of useful info being disposed eg. What is relevant, what you should focus on, and what the midterm will cover!\nI don\u2019t wanna bore you so I\u2019ll cut it at that. Best of luck, and Hoya Saxa!",

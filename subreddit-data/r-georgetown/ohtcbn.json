Anyone has any questions I'll try and pay attention this time around.\n\nWe are a smaller department that values undergraduate teaching. You can learn a lot here and get a good education. We are different than engineering schools in that you still have to do the liberal arts curriculum, but that is in many ways an advantage.",

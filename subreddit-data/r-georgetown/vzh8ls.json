    "postText": "Hi all! As a freshman who has never taken Econ in high school, I'm trying to decide between ECON 001/002, which are respectively principles micro/macro, versus ECON 003 which seems like a combination of the two. I was wondering if anyone who has taken one of these classes have any comments on their difficulties :)\n\nWhile I haven't taken Econ, I've taken many other AP's and I'm pretty sure I'll do fine in the class if I grind enough (plus, I'm always down for a challenging class, as long as the class itself is good and doesn't become unmanageable.) I'm just curious to know the level of difficulty so I can consider it along with the rest of my classes (or, whether or not it's worth the grind). I'll really appreciate any help!",

            "comment": "I'm also an incoming freshman, and based on my research I think ECON 003 is basically ECON 001 and 002 covered in 1 semester instead of 2. The content will probably be the same, just taught much faster with assumptions that you already have some prior knowledge. Please correct me if I'm wrong!",

It is definitely doable, but when I did it I really struggled with the pace, especially because there is also the freshman proseminar, Problem of God and getting into clubs. Freshman fall is really busy and tbh wonderful, I would suggest that it isn\u2019t worth the effort.",

    "postText": "Hello,\nI recently got admitted into the PR masters program. It\u2019s the first school I heard back from, and honestly because it\u2019s essentially the top program in the country I didn\u2019t really expect to get in. The program seems amazing but I do have a little bit anxiety moving to a place where I don\u2019t know anyone during a pandemic. For context, I\u2019d be coming from Canada. I have lived in DC for four months before during undergrad and loved it but I feel like everything is a little different now. I know having a good support system will be essential for my mental health (since I won\u2019t be able to get a job unless it\u2019s on campus) and I do worry about how easy it will be to meet people. However, would people say the program is worth the risk?",

            "comment": "The only piece of advice I have is that time won't wait for you. The 'pandemic' isn't going anywhere anytime soon. You said this is a top program and you didn't expect to get in so this sounds like your first choice. So, you can go to your first choice during the pandemic, or you can go to another program at a less desirable school during the pandemic. Your social situation and job prospects probably won't be any different at another school or program, unless of course you are considering stuff close to you in Canada. \n\nI'd say do it.",

The courseload is relatively balanced but you will have A LOT of reading, specially since full-time (&amp; international) students need to take 9 credits. The courses are amazing and very interesting. If you want, I could send you my Syllabus of my classes and you can have an idea.",

But I think the program is worth the risk of moving to DC and not knowing anyone.\nI\u2019m not really sure how to meet people, but there is a graduate Facebook page that has a lot of new admits as well that have been nice to talk to",

I just found out today I also got accepted into University of Denver. I have quite a few friends who live in Colorado and I\u2019d love to be near the mountains but I think I probably will have regrets if I didn\u2019t go to Georgetown since it really seems like such an amazing program with excellent professors. I want to make sure I make the right overall decision.",

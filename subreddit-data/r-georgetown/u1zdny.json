    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI'm moving to Georgetown over the summer to start a Master's for the fall. I've been looking for an apartment and found a place in Burleith at a decent price. I won't be able to view it in person (I know that it's recommended to always go in-person, but it's just not logistically possible for me), but I am doing a virtual viewing. Is there any way to double-check that it's legit? Like a DC or Georgetown registry of some sort? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help at all is appreciated!",

That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nWhat I would suggest is seeing if you can either find the student who lives there now and ask them about the place, or find someone else you know in DC to look at it as a proxy for you.",

I am going through a housing management company so it\u2019s very legit but if it goes well and I end up signing tomorrow I\u2019ll shoot you their details. They have properties all over the dc area for varying prices\ud83d\ude0a",

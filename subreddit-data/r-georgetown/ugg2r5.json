    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI'm a incoming freshman to the college and am wondering how hard it is to do the pre-med track if you're majoring in a completely different field. In specific, what courses would you recommend taking freshman year if you're planning to fulfill the pre-med requisites?\n\nAdvice or experiences?",

I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s easy, but it\u2019s doable and it\u2019s possible to do very well if you have good time management and study efficiently.\n\nWhat are you planning on majoring in?",

If you have an idea of what you want to major in, you should also take a intro course in that major. I know many people who are not stem majors and are still pursuing pre-med, so it\u2019s definitely possible. But some factors will make it more difficult. Are you able to come into college with foreign language proficiency?",

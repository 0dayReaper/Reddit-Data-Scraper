            "comment": "Yes, Georgetown uses legacy as a factor during admissions, but only during regular decision round. According to the Wall Street Journal, 30% of accepted students to the Gtown Class of 2021 were legacies. At that time, they only made up 5% of total applicants. This is somewhat contradicted by College Transitions, which says that \u201cThe percentage of legacy admits\u2014children/grandchildren of alumni\u2014was 9% [in 2020], lower than many other comparably prestigious universities. It was 8.7% in 2019. It is estimated that only 2.5% of the 3,202 students admitted into the Class of 2023 benefited from a \u201clegacy tip\u201d; most legacy students were admitted on their own merits.\u201d According to my calculations, 2.5% is roughly 80 students.",

Compared to the general admission rate that's larger, but they don't make up 30% of the accepted class.",

But I'm wondering if the reputation is both the same for both schools.\n\n\nNot trying to blow 50k on a Master's from the SCS if the reputation is not the same as having it come from McDonough. \n\n\nCan someone assist? Would love both objective and subjective feedback, all is appreciated!",

            "comment": "To be honest, the SCS is not \"integral to Georgetown.\" It exists as the money making school, mostly offering masters degrees and summer programs. \n\nThat's not to say a SCS masters could never be worth it, if you know what you wanted to get out of it, but it would not carry quite the same weight as a MBA from the MSB, for instance. This also depends on who's looking. If it's an academic, a SCS masters will mean very little, if it's a random person who sees \"Masters from Georgetown University,\" your degree being from the SCS vs any other Georgetown school will be impressive all the same.",

The school is designed for working professionals with years of working experience, not some kid that went into a MBA program fresh out of undergrad. \n\nMy SCS degree in Cybersecurity Risk Management has opened plenty of doors for me. It also allowed me to credit 30 out of 61 credits in my doctorates program due to the quality of program and institution. \n\nOh, all schools exist to make money. Law school is a great example.",

    "postText": "Hey guys\nAs a freshman who missed the club fair this fall and wasn\u2019t really that involved this fall, is it too late for me to sign up this spring? Will there be a similar event this semester? I am mainly interested in the preprofessional clubs ie the business/consulting clubs on campus and would like to get more chances to meet other students virtually.",

    "postText": "I will now review the secrets hidden among the banners gleaming in Georgetown's blue and gray. This arcane knowledge took me two years to collect. I share it with you in hopes that a) you become the coolest person in your NSO group and b) all of you pursue new secrets and don't keep discovering the same things. I am leaving out a few details to protect the guilty.\n\nat GUPD: my knowledge of these locations is completely secondhand and not a confession that I have been to all of them.\n\nsub-Healy Tunnels: The first stop on a tour of the Georgetown obscure is the tunnels under Healy. They are accessible through the \"Rain Door,\" which is accessed by opening a gate next to a tunnel near Dahlgren. The door is only unlocked after a heavy rain. Entering leads you to the university's steam pipe distribution venue. If you crawl through a hole in the wall, you'll end up in a series of pitch black and piping hot tunnels, from which you can access the Davis Performing Arts Center and the front of Healy Hall. Painted on the walls are sentimental recollections of secret societies of Georgetown yore, most prominently the knives and fives, Crux Orbis, and SigEp (not really a secret but they did a nice paint job). Allegedly one part of the tunnel used to lead to Walsh, but it has since been bricked up. Many workers have been reported entering and exiting the tunnels. It is likely the makeup has changed fundamentally over the last few months. The university has ambitions to convert this glitter-covered cave (and short list candidate for Exorcist locations) into more offices. Approach with caution. One note: there is a strange broken ladder that would theoretically go up the north Healy tower. Let me know if anyone wants to climb it.\n\nThe Russian Door: Not as fun as the Tunnels. Climb the Healy stairs nearest to VilA and you'll find a severely damaged door with Russian writing over the door. I had someone translate it for me once but I forget what it said. I heard rumors my first year of somebody getting through, but they wouldn't say what is behind it. Pretty boring, but worth a look.\n\nHealy Tower: The Holy Grail of Georgetown spelunking is getting up into the clock tower. Security is extremely heavy. I'm work-study, so I've never tried. Admin took a friend of mine up and she said the security is heavier than they let on. And Gruber's fingerprint thing is BS.\n\nReiss Tunnels: In a classroom on the main floor of Reiss there is a door. That door leads into an impossibly long hallway filled with rusted pipes and random household objects. Looks like something from House of Leaves. Follow the tunnel, and you'll find yourself in Kober-Cogan, MedStar's abandoned psychiatric unit.\n\nKober-Cogan (home to MK-ULTRA): Kober-Cogan is a six floor abandoned office facility that the university doesn't have the cash to knock down. Ignorant people enter through a window. Smart people go through Reiss. It's creepy. On the lower levels, you'll find rooms with restraints and gurneys and writing on the walls. On the upper floors you'll find plenty of office supplies. K-C was allegedly abandoned midday due to an asbestos assessment. Last time some folks tried to go there GUPD was monitoring the Reiss entrance. Rumor has it admin is getting ready to demolish the building.\n\n.#BirdsChirpingManiacally: Alas, #BirdsChirpingManically is no longer with us. If you entered a particular door of Leavey and climbed the stairs, you found yourself in a room with #BirdsChirpingManically painted on a wall. On the wall there was a tac board. Remove the board and you could enter an abandoned elevator shaft covered in -- frankly -- disturbing drawings. I went there last year for auld lang syne and the university had bricked up my elevator shaft.\n\nThe Observatory: Use this one sparingly. Up on the far side of campus next to Kehoe Field there is an almost-abandoned observatory and a nice garden with a few discrete benches. Respect the garden. Everybody is always trying to break into the observatory. Wonder no longer. Join the Astronomy Club. They have the key to the observatory and go there Tuesday nights. Join us in leeching off their free food and enjoying the view from the tower.\n\nKey Bridge: Allegedly one of the secret societies has a tunnel to the base of Key Bridge. If you look at the base of Key Bridge, there are a series of doors. I've never been inside to find out what's there.\n\nWalsh Tunnels: Go into the men's restroom at the bottom of the stairs in Walsh. There is a door. It's locked now but it used to not be. It leads to an extensive tunnel network that is much creepier and much more dangerous than the one under Healy. One might burn one's hand on an exposed pipe.\n\nBonus - Stewards Clock: Want to impress your NSO group with your knowledge of our dysfunctional, factionalized secret society? Look at the base of the misplaced clock in Red Square. The brass plaque memorializes some guy, says he's a *Steward* and has two keys (their symbol). \n\nDouble Bonus - at one point someone mentioned a secret room in New South. That would require going in New South, so I haven't been.\n\nFeel free to comment with stuff I've missed.",

It was typically locked - you could see the opening but it had a gate of sorts - but I remember this not always being the case. I think maintenance may use the opening area as a temporary storage.",

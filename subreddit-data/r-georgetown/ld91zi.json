            "comment": "Even as a tenured faculty, I can say I have no insight into how the University decided on the 5% vs. 10%. Nor on whether they plan or even consider matching now that hybrid is gone. I also totally agree that I wish more information was given... to everyone. \n\n I do know very well, however, that the University is under tremendous financial pressure as Georgetown is heavily tuition (and student services, eg housing) driven, with loss of revenue much being tuition without a proportional  reduction in spending. The University is turning everywhere to cut costs, and the measures undertaken are pretty drastic and yet it's stuff that students don't see. \n\nTo students who feel that the University can pony up the money without affecting faculty and staff: think again. We've already had the equivalent of a 10% salary cut (no more contribution to our retirement programs, with no end in sight, and research budgets cut by 40%, accelerated retirements, increases in costs of our healthcare coverage) and there isn't a low hanging fruit. Many top administrators have even taken voluntary pay cuts. At this point, any further cut is going straight into the tree's trunk. \n\nAgain, that's not to say that I agree with the difference in % given. I am just saying that I wish I had more information to judge the financial implications as the proposed solution of cutting into \"bloated programs\" is naive.",

I was noting that two of the arguments given in the letter are incorrect: \n1) that it can be easily gotten from bloated sports or administrative programs,\n2) that such reduction could come without impacting staff and faculty.\n\n You have every right to inquire about the discrepancy, but the ability of the letter to have impact depends on its arguments and they are misinformed. \n\nI completely agree with you with the business model not being suited to the situation.  The most effective solution is to increase endowment, which would have generated passive income to help us weather the storm. We're very low of endowment for an institution this size. But that doesn't depend only on the institution, as it also depends on fundraising success and donor alums.",

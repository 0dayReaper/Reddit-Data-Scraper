    "postText": "Hi Im an incoming student in gtown. I want to continue doing workout/weightlifting, and i heard gtown has its own gym(yates) and provides personal training even. Can anyone who used the gym before tell me about the experience? \n\nI'malso curious about gyms near gtown. If possible, could you recommend me some good ones??",

            "comment": "Haven\u2019t used it in probably 5 years, but it is big and has most of what you would find in a full service gym albeit the equipment is old. Basketball courts, all types of cardio machines, ergs, free weights, dumbbells, racks, etc. and the gym is built with D1 athletes in mind (although they have their own gym now), so the weights all go pretty high. Personal training is probably a bit lackluster. I wouldn\u2019t see a reason for joining an off campus gym unless you were really keen on high end classes or lived off campus (I joined an off campus gym senior year because I was far from Yates).",

I believe they replaced a lot of the equipment recently as well during the pandemic closure. I cannot speak to the personal training options, though.\n\nIt is an old facility, but the floor is cleaned and updated each summer. I recommend it wholeheartedly, but please fucking re-rack your weights. So many people do not and it is honestly so easy and simple to do.",

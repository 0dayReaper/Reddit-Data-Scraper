    "postText": "hello!\n\nI got admitted to a Masters program in Georgetown's SCS for Fall 2021 semester. I've been pretty jazzed about it. I'm still waiting to hear back from other schools, but GTown is high enough in my priority that I'm starting to do more research and due diligence of what my life would be like if I were to choose the school. \n\nAt this moment, I'm curious if anyone in this subreddit is in the SCS, know what it's like to attend a campus that's away from the main one, know what the building is like, etc. just anything that would be very helpful. Thanks!",

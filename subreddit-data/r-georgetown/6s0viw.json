I was too preoccupied with getting home a few minutes earlier to notice the car barreling towards me, and I almost paid for that silly mistake with my life.\n\nI deserved all the shit you and my dad gave me. Judging by your t shirt, I think you're in a sorority? Alpha chi omega? Please contact me and let me give you my thanks. Not all traffic is nice and slow as it is in Williamsburg, and this was almost the worst way to learn that lesson. \n\nTl;dr please look both ways, I will every time from now",

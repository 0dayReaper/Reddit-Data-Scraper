Intro government courses have a top 40% get As/A-s rule and econ generally top 40-50%. I'd check each department's website for clarity! Most 'bigger' classes are graded on a curve (whether that be GOVT 1600 or Econometrics, an upper-level econ course).  \n\n\nGenerally I'd say going the extra step of not missing recitations &amp; going to office hours (even when you may not have initial questions at first) will generally push you above the B+ range into A-/A territory, but YMMV.",

Best professors, small involved classes, wide range of class options to fulfill the major. You can do classical studies (any classes) or classical languages (Greek or Latin focus plus studies classes). The language classes are awesome because they\u2019re usually fairly small at the upper level and you can really dive in depth into the material.",

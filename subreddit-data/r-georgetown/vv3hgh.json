    "postText": "Hello, I am going to be attending Georgetown for my Masters next year and I want to get an idea of how much housing might cost.\n\nWhat would you say is a reasonable amount to budget for housing per month, i am okay with lots of roomates. \n\nWhere would you suggest looking for housing? Which neighborhoods etc?\n\nAny Facebook groups or stuff like that I can join to find roomates?",

            "comment": "Georgetown has a roommate page for grad students; it\u2019s how I found my roommates before my masters degree started in 2019. You can scroll through and read a bit about people in a bio, their preferences, etc. it was helpful to me because I was specifically looking for other students to live with. I had 2 roommates, my rent at the time was $1220 plus utilities. I now pay $2200 to live by myself (yes I have a better paying job). \n\nOtherwise, there is a massive DMV housing Facebook page where you can find places to live, roommates, people subleasing, etc. you should just be able to search DMV housing and find it. The page has like 50,000 people in it.",

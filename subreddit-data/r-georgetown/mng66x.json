    "postText": "Basically the title. I\u2019m an international rising sophomore so I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to check out campus yet, but I was wondering how housing worked. Are there any upperclassmen dorms where there is one bed to a room? I don\u2019t mind sharing a suite with others but would prefer to have a room for myself, but idk what dorms are like in the US/Georgetown so I\u2019m not sure what my expectations should be. \n\nIs it just apartments that can have single bedrooms?",

            "comment": "It is ~~rare~~ less common to find a single bedroom in university sponsored housing (with the exception of the townhouses, arguably). There are a few singles, but they are highly coveted and some are blocked off for those with religious or medical considerations.\n\nMost of the apartments feature two or three \"double\" bedrooms not dissimilar to a traditional dorm room. One community, Henle Village, features apartments with a single bedroom and two doubles (thanks u/Ccvl09).\n\nPractically speaking, a single bedroom is a luxury on campus. This obviously changed during the pandemic for safety protocols, but I imagine that those conditions may revert with the fall campus operation plan.",

                    "comment": "That's not fully true. If you're a junior or senior and you'd rather have a single dorm room than a double bedroom in an apartment, you can usually get one. Also, one of the apartment complexes (Henle) has a single bedroom in every apartment (along with two doubles).",

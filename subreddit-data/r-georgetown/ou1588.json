    "postText": "Long story short I threw away my wife\u2019s favorite sweatpants. They were navy and had Georgetown Medical/Medicine or something like that on the upper thigh. I haven\u2019t been able to find them, which makes sense because she got them while she was in med school from 2011-2014. But I\u2019m wondering if there is any chance someone else has them and can send me a picture of the text so I can have them recreated by some custom screen printing company on Etsy or something. I just need to know what the words are exactly and to try to match the font. \n\nI realize this is a HUGE long shot, but it would mean so much to her and somewhat less importantly, maybe get me out of the doghouse!",

            "comment": "If you can't find it online or at the bookstore, then here are some things that might help you in trying to recreate it.\n\nGeorgetown has [a guide to visual identity here](https://www.georgetown.edu/visual-identity/), which includes typefaces/fonts, colors, and logos. \n\nFor the logotype, you can use Adobe Caslon bold and italic with some swash alternates (indicated between the &lt;&gt; brackets: &lt;G&gt;EORGETOW&lt;N&gt; &lt;U&gt;NIVERSITY; these are not always used consistently, even on official documents, and sometimes the middle \"G\" in \"GEORGETOWN\" and the \"Y\" in \"UNIVERSITY\" are also set in swash lettering). If you have the .otf files, which you can buy or download from various places on the web, you can access these swash alternates in any standard design program like Photoshop.\n\nThe School of Medicine uses the same Adobe Caslon typeface. When \"School of Medicine\" is set below the logotype, \"School\" and \"Medicine\" are both bold (or semi-bold, I'm not sure) and \"of\" is in non-bold italics (this is generally how schools within the university style their names). See [here for an example](https://d3bnk79bkod1sv.cloudfront.net/Organization/ace9a970-318e-4465-b6b0-a95e010d683a/Images/b02271de-1ada-49e7-ba9a-8e2aa8ddc0f3.jpg).\n\nUniversity apparel often comes in different typefaces, too. You can see plenty of examples at [the bookstore's online apparel shop](https://georgetown.bncollege.com/shop/georgetown/products/apparel). A common one is a serif block typeface. I'm not 100% sure which typeface that is, but it may be [Collegeblock 2 Regular](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sharkshock/collegeblock-2/regular/) or perhaps [Winner Compressed Medium](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sportsfonts/winner/compressed-medium/) (or perhaps another font within the Winner typeface).\n\nFor images, these shouldn't be too hard to find with a Google Image Search. For example, if you need the school seal, download it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_University_School_of_Medicine#/media/File:Georgetown_University_seal.svg) and I found the image of the bulldog [here](https://www.ultimatedonations.org/lp/GeorgetownAthletics-1-1.png). There are a few alternate bulldogs and so you may ask if it's the correct one if you need a bulldog.\n\nAlthough I didn't go to the medical school, I do know that they will sometimes do various custom logos with a circle around the bulldog and various illustrations (like [this one for the school itself](https://www.emblanka.com/product/logos/georgetown-university-school-of-medicine-logo-embroidery-design/), [this one for ER](https://som.georgetown.edu/studentservices/groups/attachment/er-bulldog-2/#), [orthopaedics](https://fastly.4sqi.net/img/general/width960/458608284_pKfDcIxeHtMVB1Ixau2u__9XAEg3YXYcTS247GmsruU.jpg), [family medicine](https://fastly.4sqi.net/img/general/width960/260391_Y_XplooiJ2Y_Fe3554hLV96__mkb6pz0kyy3CLZtmGE.jpg), and others.) If the sweatpants had one of those images, you may get lucky and find it through some some online searching or you may need to have an artist recreate it.",

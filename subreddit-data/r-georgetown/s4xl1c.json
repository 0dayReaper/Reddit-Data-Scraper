            "comment": "Lise Howard is great! Focus on the one or two main ideas of each reading and how they fit into the big 3 IR theories. She will expand on this in lecture too. On exams and the paper she really want people to cite authors by name, other than that she gives you a question bank in advance so you know what to prepare for. Even though it\u2019s a big class, she makes note of who asks questions in lecture so those may help you.\n\nThe class is not an easy A; only 40% of students can get an A or A-, but the key is to understand the authors, their main ideas, and the grand theories and apply them. If you can do that you\u2019ll do well.",

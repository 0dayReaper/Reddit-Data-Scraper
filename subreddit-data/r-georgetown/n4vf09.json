It\u2019s def not sth to worry about at all. I think people in the MSB print for free (2000 pages?) and if you\u2019re in the college you have $20 budget already on your gocard. If you run out, it\u2019s 3 cents a page b&amp;w, 6 for color",

I\u2019d expect it to be back to normal by the time fall starts. Also printing is free for everyone during finals.",

You do have to pay to print but it comes off your debit dollars and they technically give you a printing/laundry stipend type thing every semester/year.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the MSB, you get free printing in the MSB because some rich dude a while back wanted all the MSB kids (and nobody else) to have free printing.",

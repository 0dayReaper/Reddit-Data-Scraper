    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m a junior in hs and I recently went on a Gtown campus tour and absolutely loved the experience. Really liked the architecture of the campus and the surrounding area of D.C. (I\u2019m an international student).\n\nI did have one concern though: given that Gtown is predominantly known for gov/poly sci (or generally anything in the humanities) how much different is the academic culture for STEM majors? \n\nFor context, I\u2019m interested in eventually majoring in the biological sciences, (most likely biochem or something of that nature, and, to clarify, likely not going to consider premed). \n\nI was hoping someone could shed light on their personal experience. Did you feel you got enough guidance from professors, sufficient research/internship/work opportunities through the university or did you have to just seek out more opportunities independently? Is it quite common for students to do a STEM-related masters at another university after graduation or is the atmosphere more pre-professional?\n\nThanks",

The others being ecology or molecular/cellular.\n\nThere\u2019s three other different specialized bio majors with its own curriculum: biochem, environmental, neuro, biology of global health",

A lot of medical research is done at these two schools, and at least for WUSTL it's not that hard to get a position in a research lab (especially if you build a relationship with the professor)\n\nSource: I went to WUSTL for undergrad and had a pre-med/engineering friend group, and Johns Hopkins is our \"rival\" due to their similar STEM specialization.",

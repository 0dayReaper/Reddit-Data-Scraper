    "postText": "Hello! I am an admitted student who just got accepted to Georgetown yesterday. In a normal year, I'd like to visit campus and get a guided tour, but with the pandemic that is obviously not possible. Would it be possible for me to take a \"self-guided\" tour\u2013basically just walking around campus myself to get a feel for the place? I will be wearing a mask and won't be going inside any buildings. Is the campus closed/will I be allowed to enter/do I need a visitor pass of any kind, or can I just walk right in?\n\nAlso, I hear that the week of 3/29 is spring break\u2013I assume the place will be pretty empty. Is it still worth it to visit this week?\n\nWould appreciate any guidance. Thanks everyone!",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! I am currently a college student outside the US. I heard about the Carroll round conference held annually by Georgetown university and found it interesting, but I could only know about it through my institution\u2019s email and its website while there is limited information on the internet and the socials. So I want to ask is it really a chance to improve knowledge and acquire valuable connections?",

    "postText": "Hello, Georgetown! \n\nI was deferred during the EA round. Georgetown has been my dream school for over five years, and I believe I have the stats, accomplishments, ECs, essays, etc. to back up my application (i.e. to get closer to an acceptance :) ). Was anyone here deferred EA and then accepted? I\u2019d love to ask for advice regarding how to write a good LOCI and other steps to take. Thanks in advance!",

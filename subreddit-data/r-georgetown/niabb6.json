I grew up in Jersey and spent undergrad in PA, and DC winters are generally \u201cnicer\u201d. More freezing rain than snow, but also not as depressingly gray all season. \n\nAssuming you\u2019re moving to the area soon, you\u2019re coming at a great time. The canal is back up and running after years of repair, with a new canal boat coming soon. Local attractions are reopening from Covid restrictions. The waterfront is buzzing, and we just got some great news re: popular restaurants coming to the neighborhood (specifically Green Almond Pantry on Grace Street and an Italian concept from Starr Restaurant Group on M). The business district has gone full bore on their sidewalk extension program, which has doubled the width of pedestrian space down most of both M and Wisconsin. There hasn\u2019t been this much going on in G\u2019town since the late \u201890s.\n\nWelcome to the neighborhood!",

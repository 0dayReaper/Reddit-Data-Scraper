You can try to get housing points / get into a larger housing group to get a combined 4 person living area, 2 doubles and shared bathroom in Copley. Other housing is hard to get but you can try to get upper class men in your housing group to help you get into apartments like henle, Vil B or A",

If you\u2019re lucky, you can get Copley which is four-person suites (two doubles connected by a shared bathroom). \n\nIf you have some special circumstance (medical housing, living with upperclassmen), you may get even luckier with an apartment.",

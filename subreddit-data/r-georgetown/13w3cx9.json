For those who have done it in the past, what was your experience like? Also, how have your experiences been in the department of performing arts? How does one get into the choirs and other programs from a different department?",

You do a few rehearsals ahead of and during orientation but that's about it. It's all together a low-stress easy to way to get to move in early.\n\nI didn't do a ton in the music department/department of performing arts but a lot of people major and study something else and do something in the DPA for fun. Don't worry about figuring it all out now either - the choir director will do his best to sell the department and the choir classes during NSO Choir - it's how I ended up doing a semester of choir before deciding I wanted to spend my extracurricular time doing something else.",

It was a good way to meet people in the performing arts scene and it\u2019s really nice to be able to move in early and avoid the huge rush. For the choirs there are a lot of different options, Concert Choir is run by the department and is open to everyone, Chamber Singers is also run by the department but requires an audition. You can sign up for of these groups in the first few weeks of class. There\u2019s also Chapel Choir which is run by campus ministries and does not require an audition. In addition to all of these groups run by the department there are countless student-run groups, including like 7 different a capella groups, student-led bands, and musical theater. Feel free to DM if you have any further questions!",

            "comment": "My daughter did NSO choir for class of 2025 and returns to sing with the choir with the next New Student convocation (experienced singers sing with the new ones). She auditioned for the Georgetown Concert Choir after that and was selected; has been in it for two years now. It\u2019s about 50-60 voices maybe, they do some pieces with orchestras or just organ. I attended the recent spring concert and it was an all French lineup, Durufle, Poulenc and Faure. They also do Messiah at Christmastime and perform at the tree-lighting in December, as well as other important events on campus. She likes it. They rehearse twice a week at night. One credit class; pass-fail. She also auditioned for the chamber singers but was not selected. Those are better singers, a small ensemble, maybe 15 voices or so. She likes Professor Binkholder and he makes it enjoyable. They also do a fall concert in late November. If you audition for the Concert Choir, you will see her there (S2!)! As others have mentioned, if nothing else, you will get to move in early and you will likely be the first person in your dorm who knows the Alma Mater! (It\u2019s beautiful).",

            "comment": "Hi! I do theatre at Georgetown, but mostly in production. There are essentially 2 types of theatre: departmental and co-curricular. In the department, it\u2019s difficult to get a tech role, but acting is less competitive. It\u2019s the opposite in co-curricular theatre. I\u2019m a bit biased because I mostly do co-curricular, but the social aspect of it is really welcoming. In terms of classes, the department\u2019s acting classes are quite good, from what I\u2019ve heard. I also take a lot of music classes, and I\u2019d say the department is good, but not very prestigious. It\u2019s what you make of it. If you have any questions, just shoot me a DM! Also, make sure to check out O-show during orientation. It\u2019s essentially theatre\u2019s pitch to the freshmen.",

It's absolutely amazing to sing with a group of people who love choir! We put together a mini concert (based on the number of songs) in one day and then performed at convocation the next ~ it was awesome! I totally recommend joining \ud83d\ude0a. Prof. Binkholder is great and so are the choir kids. I also participate in our concert choir, and it's super fun and low stress.",

I\u2019m still friends with a few from that initial meeting and there\u2019s others I realized later I had already met at NSO! Prof Binkholder is a great man and prof, I didn\u2019t have room in my schedule otherwise I would\u2019ve already taken choir with him. I\u2019m planning on doing so next semester! Moving in early was also a nice benefit. I will randomly warn you, he relaxed the dress code day of so don\u2019t be stuck in a white collared shirt and long dress pants like I was, have a back up! Good luck, congratulations, and hoya saxa!",

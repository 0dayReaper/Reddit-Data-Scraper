It is generally very collaboratively and isn\u2019t like the SFS where many classes are graded on a bell curve (you compete against other student). That being said, if you choose to go premed, it is arguably one of the most difficult paths to go on academically. Nursing degrees will soon no longer be in the NHS so please plan that accordingly if it applies to you.",

    "postText": "I'm graduating soon and figured I'd share a comprehensive list of my favorite lesser-known study spaces now that you all won't be competing with me for them. Enjoy! \n\n**On Campus \u2013 Indoors **\n \n * DML (Med Library)\n\n\tThis place is a ghost town during finals season and weekends. It has upwards of 50 group study rooms with conference tables, whiteboards and HDMI display monitors. It's open 24 hours and, during the day, there's a convenience store (run by Aramark but still at least as good as Vittles) right outside the library in Med-Dent. Your gocard will get you in anytime, room-reservations are same-day, food is allowed on all floors, hot water dispenser on the 3rd floor for making tea. Dead silent - especially late nights and mornings. \n\n\n * ICC Seminar Rooms\n\n\tWindowlessness aside, there are a handful of excellent conference rooms on the 2nd floor of the ICC \u2013 including a relatively unknown one immediately across from the ICC Auditorium entrance. These have large tables, plenty of board space and \u2013 as far as I can tell \u2013 the building never closes up at night. On the second floor facing Copley lawn there is one seminar room which has both tables and enormous windows \u2013 you\u2019ll need to get up early or have enormous luck to secure it but it\u2019s one of the best ICC spots. If you\u2019re feeling super-lucky, there are some extremely nice board rooms at the either end of the building on the 4th \u2013 6th floors. These are almost always locked as they are embroiled in some hyper-aggressive interdepartmental turf wars but they have large windows, balconies (!) and ergonomic chairs.\n\n\tBONUS: Don\u2019t forget that the elevator lounges on each floor still exist (and are rarely occupied after 8:00 PM).\n\n * WGR Fourth Floor\n\n\tTwo excellent rooms at the top floor of White Gravenor on the side facing towards the North East Triangle (Arupe). WGR locks randomly on weekends and in the evenings so it\u2019s a bit of a crapshoot as to if you\u2019ll be able to get in but well worth a check. Both rooms have large tables, lots of board space, and great views. It\u2019s the perfect place to watch snowfall and study before winter finals. There\u2019s also an excellent conference room hiding in the middle of the second floor but it\u2019s locked 90% of the time.\n\n * Walsh 3rd floor\n\n\tWalsh generally sucks for late night studying despite being open around the clock. Most of the classroom lights are on motion-timers which means unless you like standing up and waving your arms wildly every couple of minutes studying here will get frustrating quickly. However, there are three rooms in Walsh which do not have timer-lights and which are excellent (if you don\u2019t mind a little bit of noise from Tombs). Two of these are at the end of the hallway on the third floor on the right side and have decent board space, large windows, and tables instead of desks. There\u2019s also a room behind a door with a one-way mirror instead of a window around the middle of the fourth floor \u2013 it has theater-style seats which aren\u2019t great but a solid teacher\u2019s desk and lots of board space. Great room to pace and think aloud / talk to yourself.\n\nPS: The late-night custodial staff in Walsh are great guys \u2013 rivaled only by the ones who work in Reiss \u2013 extremely friendly and nice about studying in the classrooms at 3:00am or later. They start cleaning around 12:00am most nights.\n\n * St. Mary's Conference Room + Lecture Hall \n\n\tSt. Mary's doesn't have many great study spots unless you have access to the NHS-only quiet study room on the main floor. Still, in addition to the well-known lounge area in the center of the building you can find two top-notch study spaces that are generally available after classes let out in the evenings. If conference tables are your thing, the best conference-room study space is located on the right just before you get to the main lobby of St. Mary's. (Pro-Tip: rather than awkwardly opening the door to see if anyone is in there, climb up the central steps a little bit - there's a slit in the frosted glass windows that surround the room about 7ft up which you can peer through). If the conference room is taken, your journey out to STM wasn't for naught - walk to the end of the main hallway to find a large seminar room with an abundance of power outlets, whiteboard space, and table-sized desks. \n\n * Car Barn 3rd floor\n\t\n\tAll of the Car Barn seminar rooms are decent but the Grad School has this place defended like Fort Knox. It closes early on weeknights, locks on weekends (even if you have a go card), and the security / custodial staff will kick you out maybe 30% of the time if you\u2019re there studying after 11:00PM. Still, a few excellent rooms including three \u201chidden\u201d seminar rooms with large conference tables in the corner of the third floor closest to Lau.\n\n * Reiss\n\n\tReiss is a study-building of last resort. It\u2019s open late, which is nice, but it only has one really good seminar room (second floor, left side of the hallway, on the end nearest the Leavey Center bridge). The custodial team that works here has some of the nicest folks I\u2019ve met a Georgetown, be sure to say hello and chat with them when they come around to clean the rooms around 11:00PM. There\u2019s a physics study lounge on the fifth floor and some tables outside of blommer that also hold their own as late-night study spots but aren\u2019t as nice as anything else on this list.\n\n * DPAC\n\n\tThere are three tables outside the Gonda that are generally open and quiet. You get windows but you don\u2019t get good power outlets and the tables are metal which can screw with your wifi. Still a solid space for during the day when classes are going on and classroom buildings are harder to find a spot in.\n \n\n * Lau\n\n\tI\u2019ll leave the general knowledge info to whoever writes those banal \u201cfreshman study guides\u201d at The Voice and stick to lesser-known spaces. \n\n\tIf you need a study room, large HDMI screens, whiteboards, nice chairs and quiet but you forgot to reserve the room a week in advance do not despair. Simply walk up to the circulation desk and say \u201cI\u2019d like to check out the key to room 307A.\u201d Early in the semester this will result in bewildered muttering followed by \u201clet me get my supervisor.\u201d Late in the semester you will get the sort of look you\u2019d expect to receive after using a racial slur at a dinner party. In either case, however, a few minutes later you will be handed a large envelope with a remote control and a key and told to return it in two hours. Proceed to the back of the third floor behind the reference desk and next to the ILL window to find a gorgeous group collaboration room with two HDMI screens, a video conference system, whiteboards, and comfy rolling chairs. This is a study room intended for students but, like many nice things at Georgetown, buried under a mountain of administrative politicking. If you use it - please keep it clean, keep noise down, and be polite to the whichever passive-aggressive librarian begrudgingly passes over the key \u2013 there are powerful forces looking for an excuse to reclaim this space.\n\n\tNote: Blommer and the biomedical library are fine but they\u2019re going to give you the same experience as studying on Lau 4 \u2013 no special tips for either.\n\n * Regents 5th floor\n\n\tNo tables up here and a distinct lack of power-outlets but it\u2019s quiet and there are nice couches and good views. Sometime the classrooms will also be unlocked but only rarely.\n\n * Healey + Maguire\n\n\tThis building has gotten worse for studying in recent years as the university has, for whatever reason, ramped up security quite a bit. In the past it was possible to even luck out and snag the big round table in Riggs but now getting up to the fourth floor at all is difficult. If you luck out and get up there you\u2019ll find two comfy chairs next to a power outlet right in front of the stairwell. There\u2019s also a very official-looking conference room up there after you take a left but it\u2019s almost always locked and doesn\u2019t feel intended for students.\n\n * Reynolds\n\n\tThere are three seminar rooms by the music practice rooms in Reynolds. You can get to them through the entrance directly across from Wolfington Hall. These are open late, have large tables and have whiteboards. You may have to deal with noise bleeding in from assorted musical group rehearsals however and (recently) there seem to be a group of folks who get together there to watch movies on the projectors on weekends.\n\n * Kober-Cogan\n\n\tJust don\u2019t. Despite all of the \u201chaunted psychiatric ward\u201d rumors that go around each Halloween and the alluring looking rooftop, this is not a building you want to spend time in. The building was evacuated on account of toxic black mold which has been allowed to thrive over the past 5 years and you will get sick if you spend any extended amount of time here. Entrances are of course locked and trespassing will likely get you in trouble since the only way in \u2013 through the tunnels \u2013 is not one you\u2019d take accidentally.\n\n * Bonus \u2013 Stairwells \n\n\tIf you need a quiet place during the day where there are classes everywhere and the libraries are packed your best bet will be the roof access stairwells. Someone, god bless their souls, seems to have placed chairs and sometimes even desks at the top of nearly every stairwell on campus. These are absolutely silent locations to sit undisturbed and cram or think or just get away from everything down below for a bit. Some stairwells also offer phenomenal views of campus (Leavey Center in particular has nice windows). \n\n\tWARNING: **Don\u2019t go on the rooves.** I know you want to, really, but it\u2019s dangerous. Georgetown has started allowing ATT &amp; Verizon to put powerful cell antennae on the roof of most buildings (those towers by the esplanade have some, for example). If you walk too close to these without proper protective gear you can suffer serious internal burns from the radiation and you may get nauseated/disoriented and fall off the roof to your death. Some of the antennae are super-close to the roof access doorways (e.g. Reiss) and would be quite easy to accidentally bump into.\n\n**On-Campus Outdoors**\n\n * Observatory\n\n\tThere\u2019s a beautiful garden behind the observatory next to yates with a koi pond, benches, and lots of sunlight. No power outlets, but a great place to read or just look at clouds while you should be studying. The sports fields used to make noise but now people don\u2019t use them as much so the area is pretty quiet.\n\n * Glover Park\n\n\tThis is technically off-campus but so near it\u2019d make more sense here. Follow the trail through the tall grass west of the observatory to enter the park and take your first left inside the park to find a secluded bench atop a small hill. Another great place to read a book and get away from everything. There will be lots of yuppies running along the main trails with their packs of poodles but there are smaller paths that branch away to quieter places.\n\n\tWARNING: The national parks service has been known to shoot deer in these woods. Wear bright clothing and look human if it\u2019s summer at dusk and you\u2019re not on a main trail.\n\n * Esplanade\n\n\tThis is getting renovated soon and may not be as nice as it once was once Uncommon Grounds moves up there and brings more foot-traffic. However, there\u2019s a secluded section most people don\u2019t know about behind the bookstore in the direction of Kober-Cogan and the hospital that\u2019s worth checking out if you want to be outside but don\u2019t want to see other people. The esplanade is one of the few outside places where you can find a decent number of power outlets, just beware the ants and bees.\n\n * Medical School Courtyard\n\n\tIf you like flowers, large tables, being surrounded by people who look sadder than you, and relative tranquility, the courtyard in the center of the med school is great. As with DML you also have access to a convenience store down below in Med-Dent so it\u2019s quite easy to camp here an entire day.\n\n**Off-Campus**\n\nI\u2019ll keep this section brief since off campus studying can encompass a huge variety of places depending on how far you\u2019re willing to go.\nSome favorite spots of mine include:\n\n * Georgetown Public Library (good on week days, more crowded on weekends)\n * National Gallery of Art (good for books, some foyers where laptops don\u2019t look out of place)\n * Portrait Gallery Courtyard (like being outside minus the temperatures / rain)\n * Roosevelt Island (just across the river, quiet and beautiful)\n * Dolceza (gelato, power outlets, coffee)\n * Old Stone House (nice park behind it, on M street, Baked &amp; Wired close enough to seduce you)\n * Holy Rood Cemetery (near safeway, amazing views of DC skyline, cool old gravestones)\n * Library of Congress (bring your driver\u2019s license to get a reader card and then you can study there)\n\n**Parting Advice**\n\nYou can study much earlier on weeknights than you realize if you plan things right. Check out the [Eventspace Calendar]( https://eventspace.georgetown.edu/VirtualEMS/) which lists all of the room reservations for almost every room on campus. This is also a great way to find additional spaces you didn\u2019t know about \u2013 with pictures!\n\nBest of luck Reddit Hoyas and hopefully this comprehensive guide helps!\n",

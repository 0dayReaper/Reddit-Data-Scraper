I and others I know specifically picked a double in SWQ over the other sophomore dorms.  If it\u2019s the same as other floors in the SWQ, most rooms on that floor are doubles, but some are singles, and there might be the rare triple.  So I suppose it\u2019s possible you\u2019d get your own room, but don\u2019t count on it unless you submit a request for medical accommodation.",

If they won\u2019t, keep showing up to the class every day during the add drop period. Eventually, other people on the WL will stop showing up and by the end there will be a few of you left, if the prof is feeling generous they will just sign the add drop form for anyone still showing up.  \n\nThis works most of the time but depends on the class and department.",

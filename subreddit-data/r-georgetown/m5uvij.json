    "postText": "I am going to work as a post-doc at Georgetown University starting this Summer. In the current situation, I will work remotely. However, I am told that my current location (Wyoming) is not in the list of states that are approved for remote working. I found the policy (FA-623) at [https://georgetown.app.box.com/s/xwfamzoib4yxe1rwixv4](https://georgetown.app.box.com/s/xwfamzoib4yxe1rwixv4). However, the accompanying document (FA-623-P1) that have the list of approved states is not accessible for me.\n\nCould somebody help me know which are the states from which GU employees are approved for teleworking? I plan to move to DMV area so that it may be convenient in case I need to do some work at the campus. However, I would like to know other residency options just in case I am not able to find a housing option in DMV area that is suitable for my budget in this Summer.\n\nBtw, I am looking for an apartment (for myself only -- my family are not going with me -- and I do not any requirements. I just need a place to live and work remotely and am willing to share with roommates) in the range $500-700 in DMV area. Is that practical? Also, I am grateful for any recommendations about housing (company, landlord, website, location, transportation, etc.) in DMV area.\n\nMany thanks in advance!",

If you are trying to find a studio or one-bed unit with your budget, you are going to have a bad time.",

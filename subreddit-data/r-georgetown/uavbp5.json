    "postText": "Hey there! Current GU grad student looking to sublet or have someone take over the lease for my super cute apartment in waterfront. It is a 30 min metro or a 10 min drive to GU main campus and even closer to the law campus. \n\nThe sublease would be for 1b with attached bathroom in a 2b/2b apartment. \nLots of light with big windows and a parking garage under the building (separate fee but easy to arrange). \n\nRoommate is a late 20s female professional. She is quiet, clean, and communicates extremely well!",

Is it easy to make friends?\n\nFor reference I'm deciding between these programs:\n\n* Georgia Tech MS Analytics\n\n* IUB MSDS\n\n* Uc Irvine MSDS\n\n* Georgetown University MSDSA (with 7.5k scholarship)\n\n* UW Madison MSDS",

I'd argue Georgetown would be better than some of the other schools if you wanted to do any kind of work for the Government/Government contractors given how connected the school it. But UW Madison and Georgia Tech would carry more weight if you're targeting tech companies. Still wouldn't hurt you for government there, I just think GU has a distinct advantage in the DC market",

    "postText": "I'm currently planning to attend a two-week academy at Georgetown Uni and I doubt anyone will have answers/went through a program themselves, but I'm hoping to receive some insight. First of all I'm terribly directionally confused - if I get lost and ask for help are people usually willing? How is the laundry/shower situation handled? (Assuming it's co-ed) And are there any friends out there open to connecting or saying hello?",

Hence, currently, enrolled students will be housed in the Campus hotel for the next 2 years while a Dorm is being renovated and 2 floors added on top. There is no room to expand otherwise! Therefore, I expect your dorm will be 2-4 buildings from your classroom (Intercultural Center-ICC?) and one bldg from the Dining Hall. You a more likely to get lost at home!",

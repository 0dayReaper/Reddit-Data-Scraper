    "postText": "I've seen Georgetown put out posts in the past about [putting your GoCard on your Apple Watch](https://gocard.georgetown.edu/get-gocard/set-up-mobile-gocard-iphone-applewatch/), and I know it can be done. However, my GoCard doesn't show up in my Watch's wallet app, and searching the App Store for eAccounts doesn't bring any results. How did you guys do it? \n\nI'm also wondering if the Switch app for dorm room locks can be installed as well?  I don't see it either; my watch is only recently being set up, and I can't say if something is wack with my App Store or not",

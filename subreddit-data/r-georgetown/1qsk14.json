So many of the 'safe' paths have proven to be anything but. Making the uncertain a lot less intimidating will go a long way toward helping people not only start things themselves, but also be the kind of people who organizations want to hire because they get shit done.",

I am a big believer that Reddit has done tremendous things for people who seek advice or personal connections online.

We don\u2019t even need TV anymore,\u201d shifted the now-fervid speculation to established fact: \u201cBPD scanner has identified the names,\u201d Hughes tweeted. \u201cSuspect 1: Mike Mulugeta Suspect 2: Sunil Tripathi.\u201d (Hughes has since all but disappeared from the Internet, and where he got this information is unclear.) Seven minutes later, Kevin Galliford, a journalist for a TV station in Hartford, relayed the same information to his own followers; Galliford\u2019s tweet was retweeted more than 1,000 times in a matter of minutes. The next multiplier came from Andrew Kaczynski, a journalist at BuzzFeed, who sent out the police-scanner misinformation to his 81,000 followers and quickly followed up with: \u201cWow Reddit was right about the missing Brown student per the police scanner. Suspect identified as Sunil Tripathi.\u201d\n\nAll this is to say, these connections would've happened regardless of reddit's existance. In an age when we're all the media, this is going to happen, I'm sorry to say. It happened when only professional journalists had the access and it's happening even after the lessons learned from Boston [(like during the Navy Yard shooting when NBC and CBS both misidentified a suspect)](http://movies.yahoo.com/news/nbc-cbs-misidentify-navy-shooting-suspect-183435806.html).\n\nLike any new open platform of communication, whether it's FM radio or twitter (or reddit), I see it is a tool that will ultimately be a reflection of the people who use it. Most will use it for good or benign purposes, though (they won't make headlines) and that will be what I believe wins in the end.",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm a UMD student that wanted to take advantage of the DC Consortium program and take undergraduate law classes at some other schools like GWU and Georgetown. However, I can't seem to navigate the course schedule for Georgetown and I don't see a nice easily accessible list of all the pre-law law classes you guys offer so I was wondering if you guys had any and if so if you have recommendations.",

I know that in the Government department there are some like constitutional law and international trade law, maybe others, and there are def some law-ish classes in other departments but you\u2019d have to search for those. \n\nIf you have access to the course catalog I\u2019d just select every subject and then search for law in the title and see what u find",

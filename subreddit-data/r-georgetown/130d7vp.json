I applied for a program at the SCS as they have a pretty great strat comms degree from what I've read, but IMO my focus for where I go to grad school is where I'm going to get the best networking and potential jobs after. I currently have my own business but am wanting to shift to more DoD/govt and DC is perf for that.",

I think I hyped it up in my mind a lot as the perfect start to my career and now that I got in I\u2019m faced with reality (both pros and cons) \nI know through this program I will network so so so much and I know it\u2019s super rigorous so I\u2019ll come out of it knowing something new and focused. I\u2019m trying to go for a science + policy degree and the location is a perfect start. The science part is strong based off its website and the alumni I talked to too",

I did my undergrad at Georgetown and I'm not trying to talk bad about any other majors, but I feel that a lot of their resources and attention is geared towards MASIA, MSFS, and Securities program. I'm not exactly sure which program you got into but as long as you feel confident and sorta figured out what you want to do with your life with the degree you are good to go. Don't let anyone else bring you down or doubt your choice. You got this! GOOD LUCK :)",

Major football clientele; I remember watching Manchester United\u2019s dramatic 1999 Champions\u2019 League run from the group stages to Barcelona over there. \n\nFurther away, there is/was Summers Restaurant in Rosslyn, then probably the capital region\u2019s biggest football hangout. And even further out, I used to spend weekends following Celtic with the DC CSC at Flanaghan\u2019s out in Bethesda.",

Never again will I have such an awesome opportunity to ask questions and learn about other religions than I did at Georgetown.  \n\nThe off-campus retreat center in the mountains is beyond beautiful and I 1000000% recommend going on university-sponsored retreats.\n\nSeeing senators and newscasters and John Mulaney and Mike Birbiglia and Nick Kroll just walking around campus because they happened to be there.\n\nNot having to take a semester off from school to intern at some cool AF office or organization in DC-- it's relatively easy to just make it part of your expereince.\n\nNot having to wait to get into my required classes/gen-eds/pre-reqs.\n\nFaculty in residence are like family and such an underrated blessing.\n\nGU Pride performing a shadow cast of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\n\nLau Sings from the Acapella groups.",

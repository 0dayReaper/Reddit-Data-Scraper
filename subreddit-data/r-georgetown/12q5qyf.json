    "postText": "I recently committed to Georgetown and I\u2019m super excited. It feels like a great fit academically and opportunity wise (I love the focus on community service and helping others). \n\nHowever, I am very nervous about the preppy/stuck up stigma around Georgetown. I am a first gen, minority student and I\u2019m feeling very overwhelmed by all of my new classmates who went to private schools and have lived very privileged lives. I\u2019ve been really in my head that I won\u2019t fit in/find my people, so I guess I\u2019m wondering if people can speak to their experiences as a Hoya (especially other pocs/first gen students)",

            "comment": "Here's a story:\n\nA good friend of mine is first gen and went to an ivy that is much preppier than Georgetown. Before he started, he was super nervous about not being able to fit in.\n\nAfter his first semester, I asked him how he felt, and he said to me: \"you know, all these rich boarding school kids aren't as snobby and preppy as I thought... they're just normal kids but they have money!\"\n\nThis is just one example, but nobody is gonna exclude or look down upon you for your socioeconomic class. A lot those who go to a school Georgetown may be rich now but have parents or grandparents who grew up middle class (think Irish/Italian/Latino working class catholics).",

            "comment": "Hey, I'm a first Gen and low income freshman student who was in a very similar situation to you when I started at Georgetown. It's important to know that 74% of Georgetown students are from the top 20% while only 1.9% come from poor families (source: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/georgetown-university#:~:text=Georgetown%20University&amp;text=The%20median%20family%20income%20of,but%20became%20a%20rich%20adult.). I think this shows up most evidently in the huge consulting and pre professional culture of the school, the super competitive club culture(especially for consulting clubs), and finally the racial(and also wealth) makeup of the school which is rather rich and white. You'll also find privilege in really obscure interactions. People will tell you about their backpacking in Europe(literally happened my first day), assumed you could afford to travel during the summer, and tell you what expensive restaurant date they went on. These interactions add up and I think some of the comments before me that say rich people are just people at the end of day ignore the realities and differences between me and the wealthy students that exist. HOWEVER, and this is a really important however, there are so many organizations and groups that not only represent you and your upbringing and your values, but actively support and help you navigate through Georgetown. I don't know if you've been accepted into the Georgetown Scholars Program(GSP) yet, but they are an organization for low income and first generation students that have been beyond resourceful this year for me! Moreover, there are so many affinity groups and other clubs that don't embrace the competitive club culture here that you can get involved without unnecessary stress and competition. I think while there are many difficulties here, I am doing just fine because the abundance of resources that exist for students like us. I wish you the best of luck and just know that you belong here and you can find your people despite the makeup of this school and despite the privilege that many other students have.\n\nTL;DR: Privilege exists rather abundantly here, but there are many resources such as the GSP and other groups that help you succeed and feel comfortable.",

I am from a graduate perspective, and higher education administration is my degree and profession. Georgetown does not seem to value my school even slightly, we are not included in any campus integration or even made to feel apart of Georgetown. It is horse shit. Coming from one of the supposedly \u201clowest\u201d programs, I have been spoken to disparagingly by undergrads, grad students, and school administrators. Passively, covertly, but still there. The pompous nature of this school is nasty. It\u2019s a wonderful institution, but my imposter syndrome is at a constant high. I am waiting for a moment to try to call out the passiveness, but I may just show my insecurity. Be aware. I don\u2019t know any overtly rich people who go to GU, but I\u2019ve met a fair share of people who actively look directly down at me for not being intelligent enough for them.

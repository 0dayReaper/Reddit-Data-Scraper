    "postText": "Hey I'm a prospective Psych major. I'm wondering if people feel like you have enough time to enjoy yourself and have a break from studies. I want to work hard in college, but I am concerned about education being my whole life. I've heard the only free time is 5 hours on a friday. Is this true?\n\nThank you.",

Can be easy or notoriously difficult at gtown, depending on your professor, and I didn\u2019t want to risk it! I bet you could also do \u201cinto to \u2014-\u201c classes (women\u2019s studies, anthro, psych, etc to fulfill some requirements). It will also take your course load from 15 \u2014&gt; 12 credits for a semester, which was a lifesaver for me! \n(as a side note, your dean will probably sway you away from this, as they are on the side of admin and taking as many classes at gtown, but they can suck it. your life outside of school matters.)",

The main issue is that free time comes in waves. I\u2019ll likely have 3-4 weeks of free time, and then midterm season will kick off, leaving me with a lot of disciplined study time to prepare for my exams and projects. I\u2019ll still have some free time for myself, but if I want to be comfortable on the test, I have to sacrifice time. Usually, these are two-week testing periods, so outside of that, I wind up with empty afternoons to do what I love!",

Fridays/Saturdays I usually spend exploring new spots in D.C with friends. The whole 5 hours on Friday is probably some kind of B.S meant to scare new students; it\u2019s nothing like that, unless you fall behind in coursework(and even then, it\u2019s nowhere near that consuming)",

Truth be told, I could easily give you a list of every activity I\u2019ve ever involved myself in and pass myself off as as busy as any of those guys. But, I hate it when people try to intimidate newcomers; there\u2019s no point in it except inflating your own ego.\nThat being said, there are certain majors that have much later nights than others, pre-med/Chem/bio majors being the notorious ones. Still, that doesn\u2019t stop them from partying it up and exploring what they like!\nI\u2019m a freshman here, so all my perspectives are from these past 8 months. I\u2019m definitely in the early stages of education, so honestly, the brunt of the work probably hasn\u2019t hit me yet. Still, I think I have a fair perspective on how courses can come swinging at you.",

I feel like I have a decent amount of free time even with an 18 credit courseload, but I\u2019ll be honest and say I\u2019m not applying myself as much as I should. If you want to really work hard to do as well as you can in your classes, you can. If you want to put a lot of your time into the different clubs or organizations on campus, you can. If you wanna get by and have time for self-care and enjoyment, it\u2019s my opinion that you can.",

    "postText": "I'm a rising freshman, and I want to get a mini-fridge for my dorm. I know some universities rent out mini-fridges/microwaves and I was wondering whether Georgetown has a program like this or if I will need to buy one. I'm also having trouble finding information regarding microwaves - are they allowed in dorms?",

            "comment": "The university itself does not rent them, but there are some services that will do it for you; it may be cheaper just to buy though. Also, the university bought a whole bunch of minifridges this year so it is possible they may provide them in some dorms, though that hasn't been announced. \n\nYou technically can't have microwaves in dorms and there's on in your floor kitchen so you don't really need one. That said, if you really want one just put it away for the pre-announced dorm inspections twice a year and you'll be fine.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I was accepted this year to Georgetown College for linguistics, but I am planning on maybe a double major with government. Lately, though, I thought that if I were to do government, I would maybe more be interested in the programs that SFS might offer, and push linguistics as one of my minors with SFS's International Politics as my major. So I might transfer within Georgetown from the college to SFS.\n\nMy question though is is there any big differences between Georgetown College's government/poli sci program and what the SFS program has? Hearing some pros/cons and some personal experiences might be helpful. My interests lies more in learning more about international affairs rather than internal affairs.",

But the Georgetown College is really really exceptionally good, so you should be fine either way. The only thing is I\u2019m not sure if you can take any electives at SFS. You should ask.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone.  I am currently applying to Georgetown's Masters of Science in Foreign Service and hope to be accepted and start this Fall.\n\nDuring my undergrad studies i found it useful to have my own library of books to refer back to, particularly to use as references when writing papers.\n\nIf i get accepted, should I pack my library with me to refer back to for my Graduate studies as well?  I am sure Georgetown has plenty of references i could use as well but, I thought it would be handy to bring my own as well.  Any thoughts on the matter?",

Ergo, you've also got the freedom to bring whatever you want and whatever you can fit in your living area. \n\nI'm also a big reader, and I have a collection of favorites that travel with me, even when I leave the rest in storage. So I sympathize. I know how expensive books can be to travel but how nice it can be to have them.\n\nHowever, you don't necessarily even know what specializations and topics you'll be studying while taking MSFS classes, so how do you know your current library will be what you need? And the library system at GU is extensive and will usually have the books you need for your classes. Plus, as a fellow book nerd, you will might end up buying a bunch of new books anyway. You'll need space for them. I know I ended up with a whole new collection.\n\nI suggest keeping your original library in storage or with family, and when you graduate in a few years, you can retrieve them and combine your old and new collection.",

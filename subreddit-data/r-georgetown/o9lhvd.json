    "postText": "Hey everyone! I currently work at Medstar Georgetown University Hospital (MGUH) but I am struggling with commuting from Maryland to Georgetown. I\u2019m a student and am going back to school in August but still working part time at MGUH. This will double my commute time and taking the metro isn\u2019t feasible. Also, employee parking has a long waitlist and the other off-site parking options are not feasible on my student budget. That\u2019s why I\u2019m reaching out to anyone who I could rent a parking pass from that is walking distance to the hospital. A convenient neighborhood would be Burleith, per my coworkers advice. I\u2019m open to anything/any advice as well. I appreciate any help!!",

Lease a parking space, don't let anyone make you pay more than like 150-160/mo for Burleith. Also you could get a temporary permit (good for 2 weeks) from police station. Usually they are very anal about only giving you 2-3 renewals, but they are more lax recently.",

Brought an American flag along with us and draped it around our shoulders. Sat on my friends' shoulders and took swigs of whiskey that strangers were passing around.\n\nAccepting tokes when offered. Propping open a window in New South and smoking a joint with a friend as I looked out at the Rosslyn skyline across the Potomac.\n\nGetting crunk during a massive snowstorm, sliding down the hill near the dorms, getting tackled into a snowbank by my friend. Getting pummeled (literally and figuratively) by GW students in an impromptu snow fight.\n\nSaint Patty's day senior year. Cranking the Pogues as we walked across campus to a friend's townhouse. Friend proclaiming, \"Drink now and be merry - for tomorrow you shall all be hungover\" and everyone raising their glasses and cheering in unison.\n\nTipsily wandering around in the fountain during Georgetown Day.\n\nEnrolling in classes on Eastern European history with fellow history nerds and eating lunch together in Leo's after class and cracking jokes in ridiculous Russian accents. \"Soviet Moscow does not believe in tears!\"\n\nWorking in the computer lab on first floor Lau. Casually popping up to the second floor just to see who was up there to grab a snack, chit chat, and procrastinate.\n\nGetting a C on my midterm in a Philosophy class where I had no idea what I was doing. The professor was really old and would just lecture to a hall of 100+ students. He ended up losing my final exam booklet but miraculously \"found\" it five minutes after the Dean called the professor to inquire about the zero he entered as my grade into the online grade book. The professor said I earned an A on the final exam, which gave me a B in class. I happily accepted this arrangement.\n\nDeciding to drink a red eye coffee at 11pm because I wanted to pull an all-nighter to work on an essay. Ended up just pacing frantically and panicking. Turned in a pretty crappy essay and got a C on it.\n\nTurning in some really good damn essays. In one class the professor asked me if he could use the final paper as an example in future classes, and I enjoy re-reading that essay to this day.",

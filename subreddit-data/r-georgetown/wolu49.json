    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm currently a student at Northeastern, and I've been considering transferring out. I went in undeclared, and decided on English, and while we have the fantastic co-op program, I'm not sure if it's the right school for that degree. I'll write what I *do* love about the school and was wondering if anyone could let me know if georgetown might be a potential good transfer option. \n\n\\- being in a city and being able to just step outside my room and go do something\n\n\\- not a super strict curriculum in terms of course requirements\n\n\\- doesn't have an intense party culture (you get what you make out of it basically)\n\n\\- having a campus even though im in a major city",

(Socially) I had gone to Georgetown and the nice thing about the school is the student population and proximity to the things you need. It\u2019s not a party school but like there are bars and clubs to visit off campus. I majored in English but being a liberal arts school, you\u2019re incentive to venture out of your major to be a well rounded student. DC is a great place to be if you get the chance to live there.",

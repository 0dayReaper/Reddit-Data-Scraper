There are intense interviews, social gatherings/parties that are \"optional,\" and other niche application questions/essays depending on the clubs. Not all, but a lot of the big ones do--even A Capella groups and such. It's especially hard for freshmen to get into things--possible, but nobody should feel bad if they DON'T. Happy to answer specific questions, just pm me.",

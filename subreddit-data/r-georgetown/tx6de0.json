I\u2019m an American and I\u2019ve visited all over the country though out my life, but I must say DC is one of the most beautiful, clean,  diverse, and exciting cities! That\u2019s why I chose Georgetown as well, but for my Master\u2019s\ud83d\ude01 As I\u2019m just as new to the area as you I can\u2019t say too much but I did just return home from a campus/ housing visit so message me if you have any questions!",

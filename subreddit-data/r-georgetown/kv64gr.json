I would say go for it if you just want to have a fun time in a foreign country, but there are much better locations to choose from if you want to learn a specific language/topic etc.",

I definitely heard of people being rejected, but pretty much they\u2019re just looking to make sure that you have a \u201creal\u201d reason to want to do this program. Go into the interview knowing which core course you want, and have specific academic reasons why you want to do DIS and you\u2019ll be fine. They\u2019re just trying to weed out the folks that are looking for a 4 month party or are just going to spend the whole time traveling and never go to class.",

Do you think they\u2019ll just group everyone into this years NSO or will sophomores be treated differently, for better or for worse?",

Sophomores will move in at the same time as junior and seniors, not with first-years and transfers. This is all public information.\n\nAfter NSO, you're not really \"treated\" differently based on grade level - there aren't many rules or privileges specific to first-years or sophomores that I can think of.",

Hopefully, this means more events and other activities to help sophomores become more acclimated and involved.",

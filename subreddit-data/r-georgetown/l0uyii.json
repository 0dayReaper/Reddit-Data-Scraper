    "postText": "Quick question for any cyclists on this sub. Although I\u2019m not coming to campus this spring, I\u2019m still trying to iron out the logistics of bringing my bikes on campus in the future. I\u2019m thinking about bringing a race bike and a cheap beater bike on campus, but don\u2019t know how exactly to do so. I live in NY/CT, so driving down is sort of a pain and flying is pretty cumbersome with two bikes as checked baggage. Any suggestions? (obvious answer is to not bring that much stuff but I can\u2019t bear being out of the saddle for more than a few days) \n\nAlso, is bike theft a big issue here in DC? If so, are dorm rooms large enough to store your bike during the year? Are there indoor racks to lock your bikes up? My bike is insured, but the claims process is annoying and I\u2019d like to avoid going though that if possible.\n\nLastly, if any of y\u2019all are on Strava, let\u2019s connect! Just PM me whenever.",

There are no indoor bike racks but a plethora of outdoor ones across campus (including outside of each dorm).\n\nI would suggest bringing the beater and a good lock. Worst case, you wouldn't lose your \"good\" bike.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I have used my bike on campus without any qualms. Just make sure it\u2019s locked and you\u2019ll be fine.",

I was lucky and lived in Henle sophomore and junior year so my roommates and I all stashed our bikes in the living room. Bike theft was definitely a big thing when I was there (a friend had his lock cut with a torch when he lived across from Saxbys...) especially if you lived off campus or at the edges (think Darnell or back of Henle). If you live in VCE/W parking the bikes on the patio is pretty safe (same with Harbin). Keep the beater outside, and you can probably squeeze your road bike in your dorm if you're worried.",

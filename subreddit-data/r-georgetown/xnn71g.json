    "postText": "I'm applying to Georgetown for the upcoming cycle, and I was wondering which major I should pursue. I'm an international student who intends to work in the public sector back home after graduation, and I was initially set on going to Political Economy, but now reading through IPEC's syllabus again, I'm a little shaken. Which path would you guys recommend me to take? Going to College for PE, or to SFS for Walsh? What are the benefits/drawbacks of either path, and what are the different exposures that each college would give?",

So if you want to figure out which program you\u2019d prefer once you\u2019re there after talking to more people you might keep that in mind.",

The biggest difference is the language requirement. If you want to do lots of language learning, go for the SFS. If you want to just do a little bit, go for the college. Outside of that, the differences are pretty minor (SFS 3 history requirements vs College 2 for example). \n\nYou will learn \\~80% of the same material in either major, though a few of the course titles might differ slightly. The majority of people outside of Georgetown just know it as one school and aren't hung up on the exact wording of your diploma in something related to political economy.",

    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all! I was rejected from Georgetown in 2020 but ever since I enrolled in my current university (unc chapel hill), I\u2019ve felt like it simply wasn\u2019t right for me. I\u2019m just wondering how student life is at Georgetown. What are the dynamics in terms of race and class? Will middle or lower income students feel out of place? Do BIPOC students feel unable to voice their opinions without others speaking over them? I know/think there isn\u2019t Greek life at gtown, but is there something similar that affects social dynamics? I love Washington DC and hope to go to Georgetown for grad school, but I just have this aching feeling like I\u2019m meant to be here right now. Also, I plan to study government if that helps. Thanks for any advice :)\n\nEdit: for reference, my current school is 60% white, and I know gtown is still a PWI but I\u2019m just wondering is the culture is heavily affected by that",

There are a lot of wealthy students and a lot of white students at Georgetown, for sure, but many/most of them are open minded. Many of my social circles/groups are relatively racially and economically diverse, but some are not.\n\nAs for greek life, the closest thing is student clubs/organizations that have social events, but it's not the same. Many clubs will accept anyone without rush/applications, and it's basically all coed. Also there are a few frats/sororities but it's a small part of campus life.",

            "comment": "I would say while all elite schools have a huge class disparity and Georgetown is no exception, in my time at Georgetown I've found the BIPOC and FGLI students are very vocal, have an active community, and are very visible on campus through things like student government and affinity groups. I think there's a lot of work to be done in terms of the administration and the overall culture varies wildly based on the environment you're in at the time, but you can definitely find your place on campus and a vibrant community as a BIPOC or FGLI student.",

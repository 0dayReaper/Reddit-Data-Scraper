    "postText": "I'm an incoming SFS student planning to major in IECO. Does anyone in the same or similar major know if I need to take the AP Stat exam? I know it gives credit for Math 040 but apparently I would have to take Econ 141 anyways for my major, and the two classes are mutually exclusive in terms of credits. It's confusing so any help would be appreciated!",

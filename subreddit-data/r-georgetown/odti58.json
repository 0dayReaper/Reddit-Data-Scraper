    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm an incoming freshman and I have a question about the math placement tests. If I take the tests to place out of Calc I (035) or Calc II (036) would I still have to take a more difficult math class (like multivariable) or would I no longer have to study math at the college? Thank you!",

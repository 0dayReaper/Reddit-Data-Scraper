In the summer, you can stop at a [little grotto](https://uschs.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/secrets-of-the-capitol-grounds-olmsteds-summerhouse/) with water fountains. You can go down the mall too, depending on what kind of distance you want.",

Arlington additionally has a 16 mile bicycle/running trail. Rock Creek Park also has great running and a run up to Georgetown is nice too going through the city (drivers are accommodating). DC is pretty small comparatively to other cities and with the law school fairly centered in it, just exploring running to different parts of the city allows you to see a ton of it.",

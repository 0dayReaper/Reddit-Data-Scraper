    "postText": "Hi all, I\u2019m considering the graduate housing at 55 H St for my one-year master\u2019s program and wanted to get a more current perspective from any students there at the moment. Just generally if you\u2019ve enjoyed living at H St, if there\u2019s anything a prospective resident should know, things like that. I\u2019m planning to live in the 4 bed/2 bath option and confirmed with someone at H St that it will still be priced at the discounted rate of $1500/month for the 2023-2024 academic year.",

            "comment": "If you had other options, I would choose not to live at 55 H. However, the number one selling point at 55 is the convenience as everything (utilities, deposit, rent, laundry) is included in one fee.\n\nThe downside to this is the quality of living. For what you would pay for a bedroom within a 4-person suite, you can find a descent studio with a professional landlord (who might be more responsive) rather than a university Residential Education staff. I\u2019m not one to complain about water pressure, but omg the very low water pressure in the apartments here are just beyond acceptable. Helpfulness of RFs (RA) can also be a hit or miss \u2014 while, there are definitely some that are supportive of residents, others would take forever to do simple requests such as maintenance orders. I\u2019ve also heard some residents say that their RFs would not really pay attention to the items they\u2019re confiscating during room inspections even though the item is approved to be in rooms.\n\nThere has been numerous problems especially during 2022 move-in (when there was an exodus of students who moved out after a couple of weeks), from rooms not being move-in ready and campus shuttles being infrequent, but they\u2019ve ~somewhat~ improved. \n\nThe location of 55 is also a bit remote. Not only far from Georgetown (30-45 mins on the shuttle), but far from everything else. There aren\u2019t much establishments around, plus the Walmart on the same block just shut down so people would either have to Uber/order to get groceries and other items. 55 H has recently started a \u201cshopper shuttle\u201d to help residents get groceries however this has been a flop from what I\u2019ve heard. There\u2019s also the issue of safety in the area \u2014 it\u2019s just not the place for students especially at night.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for a convenient option for housing, 55 H is an option. However, there might be some snafus.",

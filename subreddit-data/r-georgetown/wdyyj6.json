            "comment": "Single was nice, lived there last year. Lots of storage room. The roof is a great perk. LXR is pretty removed from the rest of campus, but not terrible. They have cleaning people once a week, but it\u2019s a dorm and cleanliness depends on the people in your hall. \n\nWas great living near cym, wiseys, etc. and closer to town than other dorms. \n\nThere is a \u201csecurity\u201d guard. (There\u2019s also a \u201cno weapons sign\u201d\u2026) Guard sometimes sucks if you have non-gtown friends to sneak in. But most of the time it\u2019s a minimum wage student who won\u2019t look up from their computer.\n\nI got followed 2x outside at night around there\u2026 it doesn\u2019t have the same safety (imo) of campus.. would definitely recommend staying alert at night and having pepper spray, esp if you present as a woman.",

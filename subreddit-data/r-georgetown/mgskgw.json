Also, any tips on finding quality roommates? I'm a little wary of posting on craigslist. PM me if interested or if you know of someone who needs housing. :) Looking forward to seeing some of you on campus this fall!  Thanks!\n\n\\*If there is a more appropriate thread for this post, please let me know.\\*",

I could literally type an essay about what is there, but it would probably bore you to death.\nOne general thing to note though: when you pay tuition etc. at the start of the semester, you will be charged $86 for facility use. To do any intramural or club sport, you will have to swipe into Yates. Doing so means that the $86 will be a permanent charge. If you never once swipe into Yates (which I don\u2019t recommend doing; fitness is important!), you\u2019ll get the $86 back at the end of the semester.",

There\u2019s almost always some pick-up games of basketball going on there, but I don\u2019t see much volleyball aside from the club an intramural (largely because the volleyball and badminton clubs have to use at least one basketball court to set up on), unless the club was playing beforehand.\nAlso idk if this is a Covid thing, but Yates wasn\u2019t really properly explained to us either, even after NSO. We just sort of visited and learned as we traversed the year.",

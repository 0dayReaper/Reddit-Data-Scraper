    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am a international student (F22) moving to the US for the first time to pursue my masters in German and European Studies (MAGES) at GU this August. I am also traveling with my boyfriend (M21)who is doing his masters in Computer science at GU. We are both from Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for housing for a couple or possibly knows someone who wouldn't mind being roommates and such. \n\nAlso if you have any general advice because this will be my first time outside of Europe and a big change. I have lived abroad and had roommates before but I was a single person traveling and every country I lived in was in Europe (Netherlands, Italy, Norway)\n\nThank you in advance and I really hope to meet a lot of you at GU in August &lt;3",

Also join the Facebook pages for housing (I think it's called Georgetown Housing/Apartments/Subletting). You might have better luck renting your own apartment (such as a studio or 1BR) as a couple; if you plan to rent individually, you can join a group house to help you build community/connections in the area and help you get settled. If you live in Dupont or Rosslyn (or anywhere along the DC metro that leads you to those stops) you can take the free GUTS bus to campus.",

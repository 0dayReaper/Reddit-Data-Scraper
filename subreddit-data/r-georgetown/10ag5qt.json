            "comment": "Parking at the law school is very limited. It is first come, first serve, and the small parking lot under MCD is for staff, faculty, and students. I dont think they are allowing any non georgetown members to park at the moment. There's a whole bunch of construction going on at the school which has reduced parking.  Pay rates also depend on whether you're a student or staff member.\n\nThere is street parking, but be careful not to get a ticket. There are also other parking garages nearby. I believe there may be one across the street.",

Got an interview with innovo, did not even make it past the application stage with Hilltop Consultants. I heard GUASFCU is getting easier to get into because they take a lot more applicants these days, so fingers crossed for that I guess.",

And the pre-professional clubs like the ones you mentioned are not the only way to get your foot in the door for consulting/banking jobs so don't worry too much about that either.",

My son is Jr History Major, was on football team freshman yr until knee injury, rooms with other players, knows his way around, plays golf and referees soccer. Into art  and lots of other activities, can introduce you to a lot of people. \nCongratulations on admissions. College will go by quickly, enjoy everyday and recognize opportunities as they become available to you",

From my friends' experiences by junior year they find it a grind being in a pre-professional club.",

            "comment": "Saying this as someone who has applied to the SFS MAGES program, not yet a student, but who had experience with a similar hyper-competitive social group scene at the University of Alabama: you are student at one of the most elite schools in the country, yet still you are not going to be defined by the opportunities you were turned down from, but how you move on and still become a change maker on campus. \n\nThe University of Alabama has a political and social caste system know as The Machine, which if you are apart of makes your life hell of a lot easier. I came to UA at a time when The Machine was dying due to the waning power of being a old money (a southern gentle term for former slave owners) white male dominated secret society on a campus that was becoming increasingly diverse and democracy aware, and was looking for ways to expand in order to survive. As a poor (but still white) person from Southern Alabama who had shown skill in politics by running and winning local campaigns and with no connections to the fraternal life on campus, I was the perfect target for them to show that they could evolve. Being a member of The Machine would mean I would have immediate access to the top social groups, win every campaign I ran and possibly have the option for SGA executive board status. I had to think long and hard about that offer and ultimately turned it down when I learned part of their strategy for keeping power was suppressing and threatening black turnout in elections, something that was historically known but I did not realize was a current issue. Turning it down not only meant I was out of any consideration for the top social groups, it also meant I was going to be targeted as a threat for anything else I tried to do. Yet even with the tire slashing, the cross burning in my student candidates yards, the death threats against my family, and the harassment of my friends on campus, I still managed to beat the Machine 3 times through elections and 5 times through social group elections.\n\nI am going to guess that Georgetown is no where near like the social caste system I had to deal with at UA nor many people in Southern culture face, but the advice is the same: move on and do what you wanted to do in that group on your own. \n\nYou got this!",

Yes it means you aren't invited to that particular club's social events, but those are far from the only social events on campus.",

Make sure when you commit to join something, you have a plan of action for what you want to do and how the group can help you achieve that goal. It doesn\u2019t have to be world changing, but something that can show you are committed to the group and that the group will find a good investment in you.",

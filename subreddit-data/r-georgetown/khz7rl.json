            "comment": "Here's my 2 cents:\n\nAlright so, Biology in the College and Human Science in the NHS are the 2 \"classic\" premed majors at Georgetown. Biology is a pretty standard biology major, while Human Science focuses on biology in the context of humans, pathophysiology, and medicine/healthcare. I was a Biology of Global Health major in the College (I'll talk a little more about what this means later), but truthfully you can't go wrong with either major. It's really all up to personal preference. The main differences are what each major specifically focuses on, and the differences between being a student in the College and the NHS.\n\nLike I said, the Georgetown Biology major is pretty standard for a biology major, so you'll be learning about chemistry, molecular biology, genetics, animal physiology, ecology, evolution, plant biology, biochemistry, and everything in between. Human Science is focused on human biology, and so you'll do significantly less (if any) work on evolution, ecology, plant biology, and things of that sort. However, Biology and Human Science actually share a couple classes, including chemistry and biochemistry. Overall you'll learn much of the same material, and the instruction will be equally strong, so part of your choice depends if you want a more broad biology education or want to specifically focus on humans. Within each major you can also choose classes more aligned with your own interests, so you can take classes on human physiology as a Bio major or classes not as closely related to medicine/healthcare as a Human Science major (for example).\n\nAs a Bio major, you have the option of specializing as a Neurobiology major, an Environmental Biology major, or a Biology of Global Health major (or stay a standard Bio major). As far as I'm aware Human Science does not have an equivalent system. I was a Biology of Global Health major and so got to take a super cool gateway seminar about global health as well as 2 interdisciplinary courses about healthcare in America and the politics of global health. You have until the end of your sophomore fall to declare these sub-majors so you have some time to figure out if they're what you want to do.\n\nI think the differences between being a student in the College and NHS are where the real differences occur. The College is supposed to be a traditional liberal arts college, and so you have some pretty comprehensive gen ed requirements (science + english + writing + history + foreign language + theology + philosophy). The NHS has some gen ed requirements but not nearly as many. It's also easier to add majors and minors in the college since it has a billion departments versus the NHS that only runs 4 majors (Human Science, Global Health, Healthcare Management and Policy, and Nursing). You can minor across schools in the NHS, but it can be a little tricky.\n\nThe NHS is significantly smaller than the College (600ish vs. 3000ish), and so it definitely has an added emphasis on mentorship and getting to know the faculty. The NHS also looooooooves their students while the College just likes us fine lol. That being said, the Bio department in the College is so incredibly good that it absolutely makes up for the aforementioned discrepancy. The only other thing I'll say is that the NHS can be a bit chiller than the College. I won't say that Human Science is easier than being a Bio major, but the Human Science students always seemed a bit more relaxed than us Bio kids (and significantly more stressed when they had to take our bio classes lmao). \n\nLike I said, I was a Biology of Global Health major, and I have no regrets. I liked getting a broad biology education with a little added emphasis on global health and healthcare, and I loved being able to take a billion gen ed classes (some of my favorite classes were history, English, and philosophy classes). I also got to minor in Computer Science which has always been a minor passion of mine.\n\nBut moral of the story both majors are great it's just mostly the personal preference I tried to delineate.\n\n**My personal advice to you:** don't worry so much about what is best for med school/the MCAT/whatever. You have at least 3 years before you have to apply to med school and take the MCAT. You might not even want to go to med school 3 years from now. But if you go to Georgetown and do the premed track, you *will* get into med school, regardless of if you're in the college or NHS. Choose your major and school based on what interests you the most, because that's what you're going to be learning about for 4 years. And don't limit yourself to just Biology or Human Science if you're not crazy about those majors! As others have said, you can literally do any major in any of the 4 schools and still go to med school. I don't have regrets, but if I could do it all over again I might major in something totally different than Biology. English or Computer Science or who the fuck knows. College isn't just a requirement for med school - it's a time to explore your interests and realize passions you never knew you had. Highly, highly recommend you keep that in the back of your mind as you apply and start school :)",

Premed is not a major, it\u2019s a track that you can be on where you would take the pre-requisite courses for medical school while completing your major (regardless of what that major is). \n\nMost premeds are in the college, some are in the NHS, a couple are in the SFS and MSB. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in biology, the college has four biology majors: 1) Biology, 2) Biology of Global Health (BGH), 3) Environmental Biologu, and 4) Neurobiology. You would apply as a Biology major and then if you were interested in one of the other three, you would switch to that at the end of your sophomore year. \n\nThe early assurance program (EAP) is through the medical school, and I believe you can apply to it from any of the schools as long as you\u2019re an undergrad at Georgetown.\n\nSee www.reddit.com/r/premed/wiki/index for more info on how premed works",

So premed isn't a major, but most pre-meds are typically either biology majors (one of the 4 bio majors, but usually not E-bio) or human science or global health majors in the NHS, most I have met are HS. This doesn't mean you can't be in the MSB, be a government major in the college, or be a chem major and make your life more hellish, but bio and HS will get you most of your pre-med reqs within their major reqs.\n\nJust on a macro scale, I think that the biology major gives you a bit more freedom than the NHS, but that also means that they won't hold your hand as much for choosing classes and med-school apps. You definitely have way more liberty in selecting electives and that jazz, having more lenient course requirements.\n\nAs for actual material, we all take the same chemistries, physics, and most people take stats, so you will be taking many courses with your NHS evil twins. With human science they take a different set of biologies that are more patient-care and anatomy oriented and in the college we generally are more molecular and cellular, as well as having to take ecology for gen-bio. I like to think of it as biology majors preparing you for lab science and NHS for clinical. Also for tests, the NHS tests are notoriously multiple choice whereas the biology major and the college in general (for chem and such) is mainly free response questions.\n\nBoth paths will prepare you well enough for the MCAT and medical school, with the NHS providing a bit more of a backbone for anatomy, but in the end it's not a huge deal either way.",

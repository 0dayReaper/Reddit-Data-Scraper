You should look for induction compatible cookware. It's usually labeled. You may also what to check your Application Status page in your [myHousing](https://myhousing.humboldt.edu), and get the email addresses of your suitemates to see what they're bringing, so you don't all bring the same items. For more information, please email housing@humboldt.edu",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, this is my first semester at Humboldt. I\u2019m a transfer student living off campus and I\u2019m alone all the time, and feeling really bummed about it. I have made friends in some of my classes but nothing outside of it. I\u2019m finding it hard to make friends to hangout with. I feel like I only talk to people when I\u2019m in class. I was wondering if anyone was going through the same thing or have anyways to make friends? Thanks!",

Pretty much lost all my friends when they left the area to do remote learning. Its rough to make those meaningful connections right now. Though things are getting better. I encourage you to go to campus and community events. Go to the farmers market on saturday. There are lots of clubs in the area on and off campus.",

Living on my own was/is very difficult for me as well, especially if you aren't a local to the area, it starts to feel like living here was a mistake (at least that's how I felt). I still struggle with this from time to time, but I'm slowly meeting people at the gym, from my sports team, by attending campus events, or just from my classes. You have to try and put yourself out there, as mentally exhausting as it can be, keep going to events/asking people to hang out even if you get multiple no's, you're bound to make a connection sooner or later. Lastly, I'm always open to meeting new people here, so if you want, dm me and we can try to organize something!",

            "comment": "I saw another post about someone on here looking for advice on making friends, and I wanted to share it with you as well.\nLook for some clubs that sound interesting, possibly get a part-time job on campus or at the Bayshore mall at a store where young people/students shop at.\nOr here\u2019s my favorite icebreaker. If you\u2019re over 21, I came up with a fun activity. Basically what I used to do was buy a pack of cigarettes. I rarely smoke nicotine, but I enjoy a smoke every now and then. If cigarettes aren\u2019t your cup of tea, you can substitute it with joints or something creative that pertains to you. I would basically hang out in front of the Jam or Everett\u2019s and spark a cig. As soon as I lit one, I had people left and right asking me to bum one. Eventually I started to tell those that asked that they could have one if they traded me something cool, or I would dare them to do something silly or tell a joke off the top of their head. \nI actually met a lot of cool people with this method, the biggest way to be successful is to utilize your creativity. Even if someone doesn\u2019t want to participate, you already have got them talking to you and that is sometimes the trickiest part.\nI wish you luck, you can even DM me if you would like. I\u2019m always looking for cool people to hang with.",

            "comment": "Great question! So sorry you're feeling bummed. This comes up *a lot* since we're relatively remote and it's already hard enough to be a new school, especially during a pandemic. This sub's history has lots of \"*How can I meet people?*\" questions.\n\nHere are three ideas (some of which others have already suggested):\n\n1. What we're told -resoundingly and repeatedly- from folks who used to feel the way you're feeling: everything improved after getting involved in some kind of extracurricular activity.\n\nThat could be an academic club, or intramural sports, activist group, the PC gaming club, or even the college radio station. There are a 150+ organizations on campus, ranging from Anime to Zoology. They vary in scope and activity, but they all put you in touch with folks that you share interests with. It's low/no pressure stuff. [Here's a starting point.](https://humboldt.presence.io/organizations) T**here's a Clubs fair on the quad this Wednesday from 10-2.** \n\n2. Secondly, the Student Activity Center has regular events. Karaoke, movie nights, music, you name it. It's right there on campus, and it's free. You can roll in and shoot a game of pool, play some video games, etc.\n\n3. Lastly, the University [offers non-academic classes](https://centeractivities.humboldt.edu/Program/GetProducts) that are a bit more immersive. Backpacking trips, self defense, even sailing classes.\n\nHope that helps, and if you're still feeliing disconnected after trying a few of those ideas, DM us here. Best wishes!",

I would also love to hear and suggestions of things to get that were helpful to have in your room! Thank you in advance for your help!",

            "comment": "I live in college creek. The closest are pretty long, but not super deep, and tall. You also have a small 3 drawer dresser. I\u2019d say the closet is about six feet long. I would say pack clothes for the weather, which is usually under 70 degrees, and don\u2019t bring more then you want to haul elsewhere for summer months. As for what I found helpful in my room, my bed came pre-lofted, (and if yours isn\u2019t matinence will loft it for you) and I had some under bed storage from IKEA that worked great. I also brought my own computer chair, which worked out because the school provided one wasn\u2019t super comfortable.",

            "comment": "I think I was able to bring a lot of clothes to College Creek. I brought only stuff I knew I would wear when I first moved in. Then after I saw the space, I brought more clothes during Thanksgiving and Winter Break. I would recommend doing this if you can. The dresser is short, almost desk height, but has three wide drawers. I fit all my shirts, pants, socks, etc., in there. The closet is roomy, about five feet wide. I stored all my jackets, sweaters, and accessories in the closet and had extra room for more. The bed is slightly lofted, so I fit all my shoes under it too. I could DM you some pics of my old dorm room if you want to get a better idea. \n\nI liked having a desk fan, a rolling cart, and a hanging closet organizer. Also, maybe consider a small rug, a seat cushion, a mattress topper, or a reading pillow. These are not essential but could help make the dorm furniture cozier. I hope you enjoy College Creek! I enjoyed living there.",

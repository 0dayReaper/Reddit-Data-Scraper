So I just want to know how much of a chance I have to actually get into a dorm/apt on-campus. Because if I don't have good odds then I'm definitely going to focus more on finding a place to stay off campus instead :/",

            "comment": "At this time, we might have a waitlist, especially if you just completed your application. We will have a better idea at the end of May when room assignments and waitlist notifications go out to the students that completed their application by the April 2nd priority deadline. You can check back in early June to see if there is a waitlist and how long it is. In prior years when we've had a waitlist, we typically are able to get most students from the waitlist assigned by the end of summer due to cancellations.  You may want to consider off-campus housing options, but you will still have a good chance to get on-campus housing. Please email [housing@humboldt.edu](mailto:housing@humboldt.edu) if you have further questions.",

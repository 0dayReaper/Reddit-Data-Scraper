    "postText": "Hi! I just recently decided to try to go vegan and I want to make sure I can keep that up when I start school this fall! I was wondering if there were vegan options in the dining halls, and if they actually taste good? I'm really picky and there's only a few meatless options I've liked so far like spicy vegan chicken nuggets and vegan chicken sliders. I hated \"just egg\" so idk what vegan eggs would be like in the dining hall if they make them. What are some examples of vegan options they have had in the past? I'd really like to keep this up but it's going to be difficult if I can't find anything I can stomach lol.",

They will always have vegan options about as good as the rest of the stuff they are serving.  Food at The Depot is very customizable and good, so yes.  HSU is rated one of the most vegan friendly schools out there.",

Like at csulb I would have like three different things in the cafeteria and love it lol!! And that makes sense, as there's alot of animal lovers up there haha.",

Second one sometimes has vegan options, but usually not, if so it would be a plain pasta/bread rolls. If you want a good idea of what the food options will be you can check the online menu, which also lists dietary restrictions by the item. Currently only the J and the Marketplace are open, and Marketplace doesn\u2019t have any vegan options that I\u2019ve seen.",

They used to have a really nice tofu burger and freezer options at the marketplace, but they got rid of them and now it really varies. Sometimes they'll have some good chinese food, other times they have basically nothing. Some of the vegan stuff is really weird, things that are basically unheard of. The stuff that is good is served in such tiny portions that you rarely get full all the way unless you eat a lot of snacks.",

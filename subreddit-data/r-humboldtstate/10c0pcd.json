I say having a car as a freshman is unnecessary, but if you have the option, go ahead. It's nice for beach parties and such. But be prepared to help the friends you make that don't have car.",

            "comment": "What's walkable in a convenient fashion is debatable. If you're in the residence halls around the Jolly Giant Commons, you have a lot longer walk to town destinations, than, say, the College Creek Apartments. \n\n[(See a PDF of the residence hall map.)](https://housing.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/campusmaphousing.pdf)  What the map doesn't show is the canyon (the Jolly Giant Commons building is at the bottom of it) and the uphill walking to get onto the main campus level before proceeding across campus to get to town.\n\nWhen I lived in the Canyon, we walked to Wildberries, but not Safeway. While the two stores are only half a mile apart, Safeway is downhill, giving you an extra mile round-trip, half of it back uphill carrying groceries, plus however more to get back to your residence hall.\n\nBut if you're a freshman you'll be on a campus meal plan and really only need to go to town for a haircut, and possibly some toiletries, and off-campus entertainment in downtown Arcata.\n\nIf you want to shop at big box stores in Eureka, yeah, you'd benefit from a car, or knowing someone with a car. I had a roommate who took the bus to Eureka to shop once, but only once. It's a big time suck.",

The parking is so bad, I know people w a parking pass that have to park on the side of the road outside of campus because of how bad parking is. Although having a car would be convenient, I would just take into consideration the lack of parking.",

As an extrovert myself I didn't bring my car freshmen year and I felt trapped and couldn't do anything or go to any of the stores I need for supplies like Costco or target. Furthermore you'd need a car to go do anything fun",

My parents moved the same year I started at Humboldt, so I didn't have the option to leave my little pickup anywhere even though Humboldt was really trying to discourage freshmen from driving at the time. All it took was a drive to Trinidad, redwood state and national park, and mad river beach and I was assured of my decision. Also became the de facto carpool service to the airport and eventually the furniture moving friend",

You can spend your entire college experience in Arcata and manage just fine, but it\u2019s nice to be able to run to Target whenever you want. \nThere are also lots of restaurants, day hikes, stores, and experiences you\u2019ll want to drive to instead of bumming a ride or waiting on public transit.",

    "postText": "I'm looking into what easy math classes I can take. Either just for fun or in case my math from CSULB doesn't transfer. Is math 101 like super easy? I've only taken up to pre calc in high school and college. I didn't understand it for a while and had a bit of trouble at first but ended up getting a 95% in both my high school precalc class and my college precalc class. If this is the case will 101 most likely be pretty easy? I hated algebra 2 with learning the ellipses etc. Is that going to be covered in math 101? Or is it even simpler math than that?",

Topics include algebraic equations and inequalities; polynomial, rational, algebraic, exponential, and logarithmic functions; compositions and inverses; geometric transformations and properties of functions; difference quotients. [Prereq: Math placement category I, II or III. B-LD.]\n\nFrom the registrars site. It\u2019s algebra and not calc. Seems like your CSU math would transfer with no issues.",

At least one of my teachers has been giving lectures that oscillate between absolutely nothing (or repeating the same information about canvas for the first 20 and last 20 every time) and blowing through important slides so fast they're gone before I can even copy down the header.\n\nGonna be a wild four months y'all",

            "comment": "Honestly, I'm really hoping that come midterms (sooner would be better but this seems the most likely time) when grades are significantly lower than average across the board, faculty will get the message that overloading folks during the worst pandemic in the history of the US, while the mental health of young people is at a historical low point is a bad idea. A lot of folks dropped out of the semester before it even started and I expect even more to within the next few weeks. I've always been most comfortable at school/academia, even under severe stress, and had straight As for my time at HSU thus far; this semester I'm hoping to manage Cs. I'm not too worried about grades but it's just weird. Even without a job I've been working from 8-9am to past midnight every night with maybe two total hours of breaks throughout the day. I'm so exhausted that I'm not retaining basically anything and applying what I already learned is much harder. Let alone that every teacher is handling classes differently so logistical stress is high.\n\nThis just doesn't feel like a constructive environment to learn in. I understand that online courses are viewed as inferior to f2f so professors probably feel like they need to ensure we're focused and working hard but it's having the opposite effect. I'm drowning here and I haven't spoken to one person that seems to not be. I feel very failed by HSU and it sucks because I really like all my teachers, they're great people and under normal circumstances I enjoy their teaching style (at least the ones I've had before) but all the affinity and optimism in the world doesn't equal learning. I legitimately feel like this semester is holistically a waste of my time and will not adequately prepare me for future courses.",

I\u2019m thinking about not coming back next semester. Oh and group projects, with people living in all different areas. That\u2019s fun...\n\nI have three hour zoom labs and we get no breaks to even use the bathroom. In person we\u2019d get a break so we could grab a snack or take a piss. \n\nI\u2019m really miserable. I take comfort in knowing I\u2019m not alone but it makes me sad we\u2019re all so overloaded",

            "comment": "This is an alt, fyi, I might end up replying with a different account because I don't have the password jotted down.\n\nLet's see, on average I need to do the whole chapter per week for 3 courses. This means all sections of that chapter. If a math course (as an example) had like Chapter 1, section 1......section 2.....section 3......section 12, I would have to finish all of section 1-12 by that week since I need to finish Chapter 1. If Chapter 2 only had 6 sections for it, I need to finish 6 sections by that week. (I'm not taking that kind of math right now though... but something just as brain intensive.) \n\nWhich is a lot of studying, each class is roughly 3 hours of study time per class hour to try to digest that information\n\nI have 3 courses that are 3 times a week while 1 course is 2 times a week\n\nMy time should, theoretically, look like this (not completely accurate.)\n\nClass  | Minutes per week | Theoretical study time\n---|----|----\n1 | 150M | ~5HR\n2 | 160M | ~8HR\n3 | 300M | 15HR\n4 | 300M | 15HR\n\nTotal would be ~43hrs of study time, which is equivalent to Working a little over full-time. They do say that 12 units is a full-time student and kind of like a full-time job so that is kind of accurate? I don't know if most people generally follow that rule, but, there it goes. So 8-9 hours a day for at least 5 days would be a general rule.\n\nMost of my classes are upper-division, so I don't know if it is accurate, since I transferred here. Just this week alone, I'd probably read and jot-down notes... I would say something like a 150 page or so of extracting information I need from the reading material  and throwing out all the information of my reading material that is just repeating itself in the same paragraph.\nFor every ~20 pages are so, I condense most of that information into about 1-2 pages, lol. This is including finding the best time to do/finish my labs (which are the 300m courses.)\n\nI think one of the better things that one might do is to try to get a hold of the professor during office hours and hash out any information that is confusing you, being bogged down by 20 pages and not knowing what you just read or did isn't going to magically help you if you still don't get it after trying to reread it a second time.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nI don't know, maybe because I found the optimal way for me to somehow retain (or try to retain) information (I'm generally not a fast reader,) things aren't as hectic (but still a bit to digest.) And because most of my classes are upper division, my main focus is retaining as much information I need for my major as those upper division courses I view as really important (no matter how much information they throw at me I'll want to learn it one way or another.)\n\nI'll see how this semester turns out, but I do think it will be hectic for me.",

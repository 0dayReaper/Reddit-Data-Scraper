    "postText": "Hey guys. I\u2019m in my first year at community college and plan on transferring to Humboldt my junior year to get my degree in Education. For financial reasons, I plan on living in the dorms. I love outdoor walks, the rain dance, reading, classic rock, and overall fun vibes. I live in Mendocino county which is very much like Humboldt county but i\u2019m still worried about fitting in. As an upperclassman living in the dorms, will I have problems. I\u2019m just really excited to move and don\u2019t want to make the wrong decision.",

There are residence halls set aside for upperclassmen. \n\n&gt;For financial reasons\n\nConventional thought is it's less expensive to live off-campus. But, it's certainly a heck of a lot nicer to live on campus for the convenience and cafeteria dining.",

Cypress is closer to apartment living, albeit with cafeteria access. The Canyon is definitely for cafeteria dining because it has a single kitchen that would be used by many students if they actually wanted to, which in my time, they didn't. Everyone ate at The J. You have a lot more students on your floor in a Canyon residence hall, which is good in terms of forming friendships.",

I looked at off campus options but didn't find anything decent available when I was looking. \n\nLiving with roommates means there's always the possibility of issues but you do your best to manage. Hopefully yours party in the dorms less than mine did but you can try to get a single room to help create your own safe space. \n\nIt was nice to be able to leave for class or my on-campus job 15-20 minutes before it started or get a quick bite somewhere plus I didn't have to worry about parking really.",

            "comment": "I was a transfer at a different college and did the transfer specific dorms. It was a fine experience apart from the fact that I was 19 and my roommates were 25, 26, and 28. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t have much in common because of the age gap and it kinda made for a weird experience. I was super excited to finally have a \u201creal\u201d college experience with roommates but it didn\u2019t turn out that way. I think if I could go back I would take my chances and not go for the transfer specific dorms.",

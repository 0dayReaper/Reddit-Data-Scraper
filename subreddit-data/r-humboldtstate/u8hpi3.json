    "postText": "Taking advantage of the two free summer courses being offered to catch up on my credits. Which would be better to take during the summer (course work wise). The other I would take during the fall semester. Can people who've taken either as a summer course chime in?\n\nMATH 105 (BioCalc) is in person. I would have to find a room and move up to Humboldt.\n\nSTAT 109 (BioStats) is virtual asynchronous. While I wouldn't have urgency to move out, I've learned the past years that my home is pretty crappy for taking online courses. I would have to request a hotspot from the school (Do they still have them?)",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve taken both of those, I would recommend taking the in person calc class. It might be a bitch to move but all the labs for stats are online and involve running code in R to generate graphs and run tests, and sometimes downloading and installing new features for the program. If you\u2019re having internet/computer issues it may make it super hard. The lab for it is in person during normal semesters and the professor usually walks the class through the whole thing and can help you identify errors in your code when you mess up. If you\u2019ve never used R or coded I would wait to do it IRL.",

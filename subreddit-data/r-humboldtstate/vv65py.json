If you leave an empty box or empty bag or empty backpack inside you may eventually find your window broken in a smash-and-grab because the thief thinks there might be something of value.\n\nIf you have a hatchback with a pull cover for your trunk, keep an empty trunk and your pull cover open so someone looking inside sees the trunk is empty.\n\nThis is general advice for everywhere, not limited to campus. It's especially important for beach parking lots, and tourist locations, and anyplace you're parking your car overnight not in a garage.",

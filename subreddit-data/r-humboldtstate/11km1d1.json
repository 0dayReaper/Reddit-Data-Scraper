    "postText": "im a transfer student, transferring as a junior after two years of a community college. i applied to humboldt back in october or november, pretty much as soon as applications opened up, and my official transcripts were received by the school on 1/20/23 and my AP scores from high school were sent on 2/6. i still have not heard anything back from the school regarding my admission decision, and i was wondering when other transfer students received their acceptance and when i might expect to hear back?",

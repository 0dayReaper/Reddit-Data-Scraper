Some folks in that building call it \"Willy.\" Others call it \"Roxie\" or \"Roxie.\" Super cute. \n\nEither way, this is a bold animal (but no reports of aggressive behavior) who will do what raccoons do. \n\nIf/when you see someone feeding it, maybe remind that person about fecal pathogens. Nobody wants leptospirosis.",

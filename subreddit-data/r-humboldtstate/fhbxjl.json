            "comment": "College Creek is definitely the place to be if you're going to live on campus. The meal plan is unnecessary, but pretty nice to have, especially if it's your first time living on your own. Definitely bring your car; you might not use it a lot but it's worth having around when you need to go somewhere out of town.",

            "comment": "If you're used to living at home, and around people, it might be an easier transition to live on-campus first. Living on-campus is a great way to make friends. In College Creek or Campus Apartments, meal plans are not required, and there are kitchens in the apartment. If you like to cook and make your meals, it's pretty easy to eat without a meal plan. If you decide you'd like a meal plan, you can purchase one at any time. Safeway is about a 10 min walk from campus, and the Bus pass (JackPass) is included in your tuition. Parking on campus is pretty limited, so if you don't plan to drive too much, you may be better off leaving it at home. Let us know if you have questions!",

Parking is shit, but you\u2019ll want it if you want to go places. \n\nMeal plan is only necessary if you live in a dorm without a kitchen or are too lazy/busy to cook anything. I have a full kitchen in college creek and have no need for a meal plan.",

            "comment": "Creekview or college creek have the nicest living spaces IMO. It takes about 5-10 minutes to get to campus from creekview but it\u2019s closest to the forest and more secluded. College Creek is closer to town, but it\u2019s next to a field that can have loud practices early on weekends. I lived on campus this year and brought my car. There\u2019s always parking if you\u2019re willing to walk 5 minutes to your dorm and it\u2019s nice being able to leave and explore whenever. \nIf you\u2019re not used to cooking for yourself, I would  recommend getting a meal plan to transition (you can use it to buy cooking supplies on campus too)",

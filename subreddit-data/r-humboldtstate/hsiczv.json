I applied as a transfer student to an impacted major, and I'm missing a required class (but was told they are making exceptions due to the pandemic), so I don't know what to expect.\n\nEdit: My application got held up due to a transcript issue, but I found out last week that I got in, and am enrolled for Fall!

I\u2019d hate to see you lose opportunities because HSU is dragging their feet. \n\nI was accepted to HSU when I applied without meeting all the requirements, but, I was not accepted into my major directly. I had to come in as undeclared, take the class to meet the requirements and then just filed a form with the registrar to declare my major. Good luck!!\ud83c\udf40",

Yeah, its kind of a long story, but I was accepted at SUNY ESF for Fall 2019, went to find an apartment and absolutely hated the city (Syracuse), and the out of state tuition is a lot for me. I waited a year, and got in again for 2020, and although the cost is still a big issue, I was prepared to deal with it because it was the best school/program I had found.\n\nAnd then I heard about HSU's Wildlife program and it is everything I had been looking for. Plus, it's a shorter (cheaper) move and tuition would be more affordable since its in-state. I'm really hoping they get back to me this week \ud83e\udd1e",

That\u2019s one of the few programs here that has little decline in enrollment so it might be a bit tough. You may have better luck as a spring transfer. Most of the wildlife courses for fall are full. If you have any questions I\u2019d just call the registrar. That how I ended up accepted as undeclared and able to switch once I met the impaction requirements!",

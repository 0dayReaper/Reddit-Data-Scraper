People always complain that Humboldt/Arcata \"gets boring\" or \"there is nothing to do\", but that totally depends on what you are into. If you are looking for the steriotypical college ragers they arnt here, sure there are parties, but nothing to insane. \n\nI came from a high population SoCal area 3 years ago and never want to move away. Personally the area is so refreshing compaired to SoCal, way more layed back. Humboldt/Arcata has a lot of outdoor activities if you are into that, there are also a fair amount of gamers, artist, and musicians up here too all with stuff going on. Just branch out and you will find it.\n\n Many people outside of Humboldt will try to convince you that everyone is High all the time, this is not true. A lot of people smoke, and sure some people smoke openly walking up and down the street or in the parks; but not everyone is baked 24/7 as some beileve. \n\nOh also there is almost no mexican food up here, SO GET YOUR FILL WHILE YOU CAN. There are a few places up here that are good, but none that hold up compaired to SoCal/Mexico Mexican food.",

Talk to locals, hang out at bars,  get a job and or pad in town where you get outside the student bubble.\n\nHumboldt has a lot to offer, from the redneck to the hippy. Embrace some new stuff from both sides.\n\n\nThe only major thing the county lacks is a good men's clothing store and a milliner. Otherwise we have all the modern conveniences. Cobbler, tailor, coopers, watch smiths, blacksmiths, crack smiths, chandler's, oriental suppliers, and great local food.\n\n\nTheres also a ton of dance, if you dont know how yet the old creamery has classes every day for different dances.\n\n\nWinter and summer see students go away. Most dont live here year round. \n\n\nWinters are warm to downright hot, rarely into the 30s and 40s. No snow :(",

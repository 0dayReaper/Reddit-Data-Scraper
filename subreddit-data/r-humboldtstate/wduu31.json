    "postText": "Hello! My name is Madison and I have about two years left before I officially graduate with a psych degree. I'm looking for an unfurnished bedroom among female roommates, preferably a master bedroom with a shower but not needed. I don't have any pets, I'm 420 friendly, and I have a car that needs a place to park.  \n\n\nI keep my shared spaces clean and hopefully you do too! In my free time I like to play video games and watch movies. Occasionally I'll have someone over, but try my best to let you know before they do.  \n\n\nIf this is something that'll work for you please message me! Thank you!",

And working fully time as an introvert definitely doesn\u2019t help.\n\nI was wondering if anyone was in the same boat as me or had any suggestions on making/expanding my friend group. Anything helps !",

            "comment": "Honestly the hardest part is just putting yourself out there. For me personally I joined groups/sports when I'm taking classes to branch out which can lead to fun stuff during the summer. You're other best bets are to look at the events happening around arcata and Eureka and see if you find anything interesting, you'll hopefully meet some like minded people and make some connections! Go to events like the farmers market in the plaza on Saturdays and things like that. It's super easy to hermit yourself here and this Def helped me in the 3 years I've been here for school!",

I work a lot of local businesses and meet a lot of people. I have a fair amount of friends. But this only happened in my last year at HSU. took a lot of courage as a dedicated introvert myself. but you got it!! just do what makes you happy",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an incoming freshman &amp; I got an email today about limited parking passes. And I was wondering if it\u2019s even worth taking my car up there. I will be dropped off up there with my car, but I just got my license so my parents aren\u2019t allowing to do the drive back \u201chome\u201d on holidays,  &amp; I know the actual town is pretty small, public transport is cool &amp; I\u2019ll be living &amp; being on campus a lot of the time so I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s even worth bringing a car up there, especially with the limited parking? Lmk what you guys think \nAlso do the dorms have separate parking, if so how would I even purchase the pass?",

If you\u2019re not leaving town often you can just reserve a zip car or take the shuttle to Eureka. The local bus system is also free for students.\n\nThe parking pass itself works for all lots (both dorm lots and general lots) but all spots fill up fast.",

            "comment": "There is some parking reserved for the residence halls. If you are in the Canyon or the Hill, you will park most often in R2 or G1 shown at the top of this [campus map](https://www.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/campusmap.pdf) along Granite Avenue. The Hill has its own parking (R4), but not enough, so Hill residents drive there first hoping to get lucky. Creekview residents have the R3 lot, but it has parking for roughly half the residents, so they also park in the R2 and G1 lots.\n\nIf you never leave Arcata, you can certainly get by without a car. You'd primarily walk into town for a haircut and maybe toiletries or a restaurant. Your student ID card is a free pass on the [Arcata bus](https://hta.org/agencies/arcata-and-mad-river/). (That website is a little dysfunctional. Download the PDF route map.)  The bus stop is at the campus library.\n\nThere is a [separate county bus system](https://hta.org/) you'd use to travel to Eureka. It's less than ideal, but gets you there. Your campus ID card also gets you a free ride there.\n\nYou may also become friends with student(s) who do have a car with them.\n\n[Parking passes](https://parking.humboldt.edu/parking-fees) are purchased at Student Financial Services in the Student and Business Services Building.",

    "postText": "When I received the email from the school with the subject \"Election Preparedness\" I just laughed. If the school really cared about us and our mental health during this time, they would instruct professors to take it easy on us. My workload increased by a ton this past week and I'm going to have even more this upcoming week (election week). I'm overwhelmed by the pandemic, the new supreme court justice, and one of the biggest elections in U.S. history. So why do professors think it's okay to add even more stress to all of that?",

A lot of profs who are doing that are honestly just out of touch and not aware to the degree their students are struggling outside of just academics. Most genuinely want their students to succeed and to support you when you are struggling. You just need to let them know/ask for some accommodations while you're going through stressful periods.",

Personally, I was decently prepared (it was a GE elective for me, but related to hubby's major), but I went in shellshocked, sleep deprived, and hungover - and I wasn't even the worst looking in the bunch.  The professor ended up still having us take the midterm, but he gave us a VERY generous curve to make sure we didn't just fail a science elective for non-STEM majors because of this.",

(I\u2019m 5\u20192) Jumping was too much effort to do everyday.\n\nIt\u2019s kinda small? I spent most of my time in my dorm bedroom and i would say its big enough for me and my cat to live in. Decorating and everything is easy. Lots of closet space. And if you do put your bed on at least medium setting you get a good amount of under bed space. I had so much stuff under the bed as storage it helps a lot.\n\nThe rooms facing courtyard are like kinda loud sometimes. but its manageable mostly quiet from what i remember.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much all, good luck next semester!",

When you went to pick your room did they not have a floor plan with measurements? If you still have the ability to choose I would suggest picking the side of the apartment where only you and another person share a bathroom.",

There was a large enough space by the door for a bookshelf if someone wanted to place one there. It\u2019s a good sized room for what it is, but I\u2019d definitely say doubles have got to get cramped.",

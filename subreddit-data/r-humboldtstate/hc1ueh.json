            "comment": "Another approach is to reply to each of the Craigslist bike ads with something along the lines of \"I am an HSU student looking for a bike.  I can only afford to spend XX dollars, which I know is well below your asking price, but if you are in a hurry to let it go, I would be very grateful to buy it for XX.\"\n\nAs someone who has sold (and given away) many things on Craigslist, I can tell you that sometimes the seller knows their price is high, especially if the item doesn't immediately sell.  Sometimes they just want to get rid of the item, but didn't price it well.  Another thing is that sellers often appreciate a polite response, and you may find their soft spot and get them to agree to a lower price even though they hadn't planned on it.\n\nGive it a shot.  Your only cost is 10 minutes of your time.  Good luck!",

There is also the bike kitchen in eureka and the bike library in arcata who sell used and usually beat bikes they put together. Good luck!",

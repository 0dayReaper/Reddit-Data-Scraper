Have fun getting a Phd to be competitive or retraining to learn something useful. In the vast majority of cases, the only people that can make a ss degree work financially are those coming from wealthy families (as they were originally intended). Regardless of what you think, nobody in the real world cares about what you \\*wanted\\* or thought you were entitled to study. When you graduate, in less your already rich, in which case my statement doesn't apply to you, you will realize that only your skills and ability to work hard stand between you and the street, or a really shitty job not associated with what you studied that you hate. Don't like my advice? Just remember I like my coffee black.",

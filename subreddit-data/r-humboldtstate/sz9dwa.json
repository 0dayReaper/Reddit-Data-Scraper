            "comment": "There are basically 2 halls for freshman. The canyon and the hill. The hill is a little more central but a little shittier, and the canyon is a bit better and more in the forrest. Just also look at the pics and layout see what you like. For meal plans it depends on how much money you wanna pay and how much time you want to spend every week preparing food. Some people would like to save the money and some don\u2019t want to worry about it , have a good first semester though!",

            "comment": "I would not skimp on the meal plan. I wouldn\u2019t get the most expensive but not the cheapest either. If you get the cheapest you can easily run out of points within a few months (or less, I knew someone who ran out of points in less than 3 weeks) if you are not careful, and you will end up spending more $ getting food by other means. \n\nResidence halls: the hill is closest to the rest of campus, has the smallest dorms, and is the most \u201ctypical college dorm like\u201d. It\u2019s always poppin with stuff going on, lots of fun to be had. As I recall it was often noisy at nights, especially on weekends. If you have hard classes, get to know the library. \n\nCanyon is further away and more secluded from other dorms. I found it almost had a \u201ccamp\u201d feel to it. Dorms were bigger (had common areas unlike the hill which are just one rectangular room), but the sleeping arraignment imo was worse (small bunk beds, would have hated sharing a bed like that). Canyon is closer to the school-owned portion of the community forest though, and all the fun that entails early in the year when the weathers nice ;)",

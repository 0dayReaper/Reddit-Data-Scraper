My partner and I were wondering if there would potentially be room to bring both of our cars to campus instead of just one. How\u2019s the parking lot looking at Creekview Suites during the semester? Any advice would be very much appreciated!",

I moved up with a partner and got through our first year with 1 vehicle. So much of the time was spent walking with new friends and such there were only a few times was it an issue not having 2. If you both are planning on getting jobs then it might be worth bringing both if one or both of you get jobs outside of Arcata",

You\u2019ll have to walk near the main parking area when you go to class, so it\u2019s not like parking doesn\u2019t exist, but they do sell more permits than there are spaces (I don\u2019t know why!)",

That being said, it can be quite full depending on the semester, but there is almost always a spot in the general parking lot at the bottom of the hill.\n\nAround campus, lots generally fill up in the mornings and stay full through the afternoon. Resident lots sometimes empty out in the day but are full in the evenings, so sometimes you may get back to the dorms after a night of running around and be in a tough spot. That being said, I don't recall ever not having a spot somewhere in Creekview when I lived there.",

If you don't get a spot at the top of the hill, you'll likely get one at the bottom of the hill next to the Jolly Giant Commons building. During my time, pre-pandemic, the parking lot next to Creekview had spots for half the residents.",

At College of the Redwoods, those with disabled placards were exempt from the permit based on the disabled parking guidelines. Anyone have information on this?",

However, you can park in any ADA stall with just a day/general permit regardless of if that area is marked as staff/resident/general. \n\nI would double-check this with Parking first though!",

A vehicle displaying a disabled person placard or license plates may park for unlimited time periods at a parking meter without paying the meter or purchasing a daily permit.\n\nEmphasis mine. I think the ADA law (Section 22511.5 of the California Vehicle Code) is specific to timed parking, such as parking meters. Everywhere else on campus is permit parking regardless of duration.",

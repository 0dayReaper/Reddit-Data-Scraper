Cypress are 4 people apartments with a good view. I wasn't a fan of campus apartments, the building is old and had some power issues that I remember. Creekview is dope, kindof a ski resort vibe, but just as removed from the rest of campus, so be ready for a hike if you don't have a car.",

The hill is cool too i had buddies who lived there and they said there\u2019s always kickbacks. the other places on campus are more laid back and have much more space. depends on the characters you want to meet. for a freshman i\u2019d definitely go with those first 3 mentioned locations.",

On the plus side, The J is really close by compared to your other living options.\n\nI've not seen College Creek (it's after my time), but they're the newest buildings and have kitchens. They're also centrally located for walking off campus to the nearby Wildberries Marketplace. A walk for on-campus lunch is a bit of a distance, but not bad, at The Depot off the main clock tower quad. And you might be in that area anyway around lunchtime.\n\nCampus Apartments used to be privately owned and operated (yes, called Campus Apartments even back then), but were acquired by the university maybe 20-ish years ago. They didn't have a great reputation before the university took over management. I'll leave opinions about them to other users here.\n\nI'd skip the Creekview residence halls. They are at the top of a large hill, and there's only parking for half the residents. You walk up and down that hill multiple times a day, and then right back up a hill to reach the main campus. A meal plan is also required, because the buildings were the first major expansion of the original residence halls that are nestled near The J cafeteria. \n\nThe residence halls around The J have their own mini-culture, being a focal point for freshmen and residence hall activities. If that interests you, Cypress would keep you in that loop. Otherwise, I'd probably choose College Creek today.",

I didn't stay in Campus Apartments, but there looks to be a small parking lot for those apartments adjoining main campus parking lots. My *guess* is the only better parking scenario is a residence hall near the Jolly Giant Commons. There is a large resident lot there, although during my time it was twice the size (half of it is now for general parking). There's probably a good chance because the back half of the lot was never full.\n\nIf you aren't leaving campus every day, then if you've had to park far away, you can repark your car to a preferred lot as parking spaces become available in the late afternoon. The resident lot next to Campus Apartments probably remains full, but the general lot next to it wouldn't.",

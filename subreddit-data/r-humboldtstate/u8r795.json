I know I can\u2019t hang drapery from the ceiling around my bed, but has anyone tried hanging fabric on the walls so it\u2019s kind of the same aesthetic?",

The handbook is rarely used with this kind of stuff. At most you\u2019ll just get a verbal warning but even that I kind of doubt it\u2019ll happen. Hope your room turns out!",

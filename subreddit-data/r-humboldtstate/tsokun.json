    "postText": "I'm a student at Cal Poly Humboldt living in Arcata, and I'm looking for musicians to jam with and potentially start a band with. I have been making music for 8 years, I can play guitar, rhythm, lead, or fingerstyle (my specialty is rhythm), I can play foundational bass guitar, I can play the piano/keys, I can sing, and I can lay down a basic groove on the drums.\n\nI am also a songwriter, I am fluent with DAWs (predominantly FL Studio) I can record, mix and master, and I have music released, here is an example, [a song of mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3e7Los2QM0&amp;ab_channel=TheMoths-Topic) You can check me out as The Moths on all platforms, and prodleftfield on youtube.\n\nI have experience being in a band and jamming, my biggest influences are Radiohead, The Beatles, The Velvet Underground, Duster, etc. I am familiar with playing most styles of music mostly art rock, folk, punk, slowcore, classic rock, indie, funk and some jazz as well. I have a solid foundational knowledge of music theory and can communicate and understand musical concepts well.\n\nIf you're in the area and are looking to jam or start something bigger, message me.",

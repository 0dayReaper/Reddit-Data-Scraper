    "postText": "I was admitted to Humboldt for fall 2020 for the ERE program and I noticed that if someone took a class more than twice, they would not be able to graduate with an ERE degree. \n\nI took calc 2 three times at my CC. Would this disqualify me from the program? As a backup, I was thinking about majoring in computer science there if I\u2019m not allowed into the program. \n\nI really want to go to Humboldt as I love the area there. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks",

I am transferring to HSU this semester (Wildlife Management and Conservation) and, as a 34 year old undergrad, am wondering how many other non-traditional students are on this subreddit. \n\nAre there any clubs or organizations that help us find each other?  If not, say hello here!  I am moving up from San Francisco sometime in the next few months and it would be nice to find a community.",

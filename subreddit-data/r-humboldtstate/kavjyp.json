    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'm studying Psych and I was recently accepted for admission to HSU to attend during Fall 2021. I'm leaning towards accepting because I've been wanting to experience living in NorCal. I love nature and I've read good things about the Uni. \n\nI procrastinated on completing my undergrad degree so i'm much older (31 years old). I'm wondering if attending this school will affect my experience at all? Are the majority of students directly out of high school? \n\nI'm currently in LA and the Cal States near here seem a bit more diverse with demographics. Any information offered is much appreciated.",

            "comment": "I was mid-ish 30s when I transferred  (also a psych major) and within our field the age is a pretty solid mid to late 20s with a sprinkle of 30+ folks. There's  a decent amount of underclassmen,  but as a transfer you won't be in a whole lot of classes with them. But at my time at HSU I made friends and mingled with people who were young enough to be my kid, and others old enough to be my grandparents. Hell, I was older than some of my professors and worked as an RA! Don't let your age be a distraction, it's really not that big of a deal!",

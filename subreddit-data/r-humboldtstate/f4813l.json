I\u2019m sincerely nervous about this and am going up to visit next month, is there anything should keep in mind? \ntysm\ud83e\udd7a\n\nEdit: thank you to those that have been nice enough to shed light on any information for me.

If that makes you uncomfortable then your experience may not be great here.\n\nThe majority of the racism you will experience will be students and professors acting weird trying way too hard to be \u201cwoke\u201d around you.",

In the surrounding towns of McKinleyville, Eureka, and Blue Lake you\u2019re more likely to run across some...exuberant white people. Trump merch and such. McKinleyville has a chapter of the KKK which is something to be careful of when you go out there. There\u2019s also the case of Josiah Lawson. \n\nBottom line, The school itself isn\u2019t racist (but it could be more supportive), the students aren\u2019t racist, and Arcata is chill. But there\u2019s gonna be some racism anywhere you go to, this is america after all.\n\nedit: also while there are prominent poc groups on campus the area is primarily white, you can look up the numbers",

Years earlier, he investigated the rumor while he was editor of the McKinleyville Press and came to the same conclusion.

I've lived here for about 6 years now and lived in another state before that. Humboldt County is majorly white. However, when HSU is in session many students come from the LA area and are typically of a more diverse population than what Humboldt typically offers. Most locals here other than in the outskirt towns (like Fortuna, Ferndale and McKinleyville) are usually fairly liberal and open-minded. I have seen a few Rebel flags in McKinleyville for example and have heard talk of Fortuna and Ferndale's racism, so it's not an area that is completely void of such issues. However, I feel that for the most part Humboldt is usually accepting of everyone and friends of mine that are persons of color have not had issues of racism in the area. My perspective is a small scope though, but if you have further questions you could reach out to the [ODEI office](https://diversity.humboldt.edu) at HSU and ask them any further questions you may have.",

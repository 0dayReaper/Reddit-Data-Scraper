    "postText": "Did anyone else try to see if their courses transfered over, only to find that you have no transfer credit? I looked at \"my academics\" under my student center and I don't see any transfer credit. Is this because I haven't done orientation/met with an advisor? Will this change? I really need my units to transfer over lol. The admissions counselor had mentioned that my transcripts were evaluated when I spoke with him. Soo why aren't my credits showing?!?!",

I needed to get all math above calc I, organic chemistry series, and human anatomy/physiology series approved before it would show, despite it being matriculated in Assist. Just make sure you contact your interim academic advisor and they will help you get it sorted out.",

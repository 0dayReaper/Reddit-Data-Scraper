Google's [Street View](https://goo.gl/maps/DrHDcNTGvAmY6Rk4A) last saw Carlson Park as a big lawn with a few trees.\n\nI found this on the city's Parks &amp; Recreation webpage:\n\n&gt;Carlson Park:\n\n&gt;The City of Arcata is actively seeking grant funding to allow for renovation of Carlson park including improved trails and river access, a play ground and picnic area, parking lot and vault toilets.  \n\n[Map of all Arcata parks](https://cityofarcata.org/DocumentCenter/View/1337/Arcata-Parks-and-Playgrounds-Map-and-Amenities-PDFs?bidId=) (PDF)\n\nAccording to [this 2017 newspaper article](https://www.madriverunion.com/articles/arcatas-new-carlson-park-offers-mad-river-access/) there is supposed to be access to the Mad River from Carlson Park.",

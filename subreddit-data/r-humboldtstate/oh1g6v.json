Not sure where they are coming from, say SoCal or NorCal but it would be cool if you could meet up before move in day. I think it will just take some getting used too having a shared space, probably best to set up some ground rules at first like borrowing things, having friends over and how late etc.",

            "comment": "Well, establish some rules early on. Like bed time, having guests over (how often and how late), playing music (I suggest using headphones at all times!), eating in the room (yay or nay?), chores list (like vacuuming). Talk about your comfort level about walking around in undies. Talk about how clean you\u2019d like to keep the room. Talk about whether you\u2019re heavy or light sleepers. If you share a bathroom then I suggest talking about how you\u2019ll split the cleaning and the cost of stocking it up with supplies. \n\nI feel so bad about how awful I was to my college roommates. I wasn\u2019t awful intentionally. Just looking back, I see how inconsiderate I was and if we had talked about things earlier on, then we would probably still talk. Lol but I was young and didn\u2019t know what I was doing.",

            "comment": "Like others have mentioned, setting boundaries is important. However, I would advise against throwing all of your expectations at them on day one or (God forbid) writing a \"roommate contract\" for them to sign. The roommates I had who were really aggressive about boundary setting were often the worst offenders in practice. If they seem receptive to sitting down on day one and establishing ground rules, go for it, but otherwise my advice for you is threefold.\n\n1. Deal with issues as they come up (not before or after). In my experience, people take offense if you preemptively ask them not to do something inconsiderate, but waiting too long sets a bad precedent. When something happens, bring it up immediately but casually and express your feelings about it, more like starting a conversation than stating a rule. \n\n2. Create positive experiences with your roommate. They will be way more understanding of your wants and needs if you take the time to get to know them or develop a relationship beyond walking past each other. You don't have to be best buds, but invite them to get food, go to a movie, study, etc. every once in a while. \n\n3. Be prepared to flex your expectations. It's okay to have non-negotiables (especially around safety and personal space), but you'll probably have to compromise some of your standards. If you're a neat freak, you may have to get used to dishes in the sink. If you're a slob, you may need to tidy up more than normal. That's just the nature of sharing your personal space with another human.",

The first one told me he wanted to kill his brother, so I moved out and told housing, the second one tried to insert himself into my life more often than I wanted but we eventually got along. Find something early on that you both like. Something sort of specific, don't just have it be video games, or movies, or music, have it be a certain video game series, director, or artist. Finding common ground on something you both like early on can help to provide you both with the ability to relate to one another. Establish ground rules ASAP. My first roommate used my stuff without asking... I don't like that so I had to tell him to knock it off multiple times. Just sit down and establish what is okay and what is not okay as soon as you can. Offer to go get lunch or even cook for your roommate, food can be a fantastic ice breaker.",

I love people who do different hobbies, like I don't work on cars so I try to surround myself with car people so I can learn the basics and help out and gain some insight.\n\nShare food to save money. I cook and I cook big for lots of leftovers so always good to learn new dishes.\n\nDon't be passive aggressive....Just do it, if something bothers you bring it up, learn to compromises because the semester is long.",

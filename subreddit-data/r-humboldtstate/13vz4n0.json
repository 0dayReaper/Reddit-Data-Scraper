Do you keep a general dehumidifier in the room, or get one specifically for inside the tank? Any other general advice? :)",

Granted, the room stays pretty well heated because of/for my other lizards so there isn\u2019t as much moisture.\n\nI know there are some issues in general with the dorms being humid where a room dehumidifier might just be a good option regardless. It will help you with the room and make 100% sure your gecko has no issues!\n\nAs a note, there was one time my leopard gecko got a respiratory infection due to other factors (he escaped into my sink overflow drain for a few days). Arcata Animal Hospital was super helpful in getting him in quickly and treating him!",

            "comment": "Hello! I have had a Leopard Gecko for the last three years up here and I would say if you live off campus, you and your gecko will thrive just fine. On campus came with a plethora of issues including the humidity. I used a dehumidifier in my dorm the first year and it helped some but given the age and state of the buildings, the moisture and mold is really everywhere. I found that the moment I moved off campus, my geckos mystery issues with eating and shedding were cured. I would recommend either living in the newer buildings that they are setting up with a dehumidifier or try for off campus for the health of your sweet gecko. Best of luck and feel free to DM me with questions if you need anything :)",

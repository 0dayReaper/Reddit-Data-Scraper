    "postText": "Hi i\u2019m an incoming freshmen and i\u2019m currently looking into freshmen on campus housing for next year and found this program/community called \u201camong giants\u201d. Does anyone know about this? The housing is at The Hill-Sunset dorms. How good are these dorms? Before I found this I was looking into the canyon, but now I don\u2019t know. Also I plan to major in environmental studies, is this a good fit for me?",

The canyon is definitely architecturally the prettiest, but the sunset/hill dorms have the newest/largest social spaces &amp; study spaces, with I think even a ping-pong table? Not really sure but I remember being jealous of the hill/sunset guys because the common rooms always seemed like a party haha! \n\nOn another note, if you can, *definitely* sign up for Klamath connection if you\u2019re an environmental/natural resources major. I didn\u2019t my freshman year and got seriously screwed out of opportunities/classes. Had to work my ass off to get the same shit KC got.",

Among giants only includes people with bio, botany, or zoology majors, whereas klamath connection includes more majors, like environmental science, forestry, wildlife, etc. I'm a freshman forestry major, so I had the klamath connection experience this past semester. It's definitely not worth doing if it you have to take it in a virtual format. Just like with among giants, though, you would be in sunset/redwood. Like another commenter had said, they're kinda ugly dorms, but nothing really wrong with them. Just your standard dorms.\n\nI don't know if it's mandatory to be in klamath connection if you choose that major.\n\nI honestly think it was a good program before everything became virtual.\n\nIf you're able to, and you choose to opt out of being in the program so that you can be in a different dorm, it's a lot less likely that there will be people in the same majors living near you.",

It also gives you great connections within your major and related disciplines which can seriously save your butt when trying to find a study group in the harder courses like calculus or memorization-heavy taxonomy classes.  Also, if you are from way out of the area, it's a great way to get established in the region - as Humboldt is so isolated, it may be hard to forge professional contacts without an \"in\", and the thematic freshman communities also give you opportunities for just getting to know the nature, sights, and important places in a more organized manner than trying to figure it out yourself.\n\nBut as /u/zoakselotofpetenheim mentioned it, if you are more the type to keep to yourself, it may not be worth it.",

Whether it's klamath connection or among giants, the point is being connected with other students. It'll put you in the same classes with the same people throughout the years you spend at the school and it'll put you in the same dorms. If that's not something that's that important to you, then the programs aren't really worth doing. It's not like you won't be meeting the people without being in the specific programs, and just do to your major, you'll probably end up in similar classes.",

I\u2019m in Klamath connection because all the natural resources freshman are automatically enrolled in the PBLC (Place Based Learning Communities) I didn\u2019t choose to house with the pblc kids and chose to be with another theme housing. With covid a lot of things are super restricted in the dorms. I have friends in sunset and it\u2019s decent. I live in the canyon dorms. Canyon is pretty but the walls are much thinner than sunset. It just depends where you want to live.",

We often went into the woods because the trail was right there. There is a trail off the main trail that goes over the creek that leads up to the football field. It\u2019s also fairly quiet as mostly upperclassmen are there. Really nice overall.",

Plus it would give me a reason to want to be outside. It's looking like I'll be getting a first floor suite if my housing info doesn't change but after the hill that needs to be walked perhaps it's for the best \ud83d\ude02",

            "comment": "Creekview was awesome. Felt like I was almost not living on campus because its more secluded. For the suites, theres no oven for cooking and just an induction stove, microwave and fridge/freezer. Like others have said, there is a big hill to climb with no real way around it (not that I found anyway) and can be far from classes depending on what buildings you're going to. I just made sure I had everything I needed for the day to avoid a panicked run across campus. It has super easy access to the community forest. Not great in terms of parking though. The only noise I really heard from campus was from the football field although that might have changed since getting rid of the team. I really loved it and lived in Juniper for 2 years.",

                    "comment": "At first, I was a bit disappointed by the idea of potentially getting assigned to the suites instead of the apartments because of the lack of oven but really with having to walk up a big hill, being right by the forest, and the lack of oven to cook frozen food in it, it feels like a sign that this is the opportunity to make a healthy lifestyle change so I'm not too bummed out.",

They have a nice secluded in the forest feel from them but you aren't that far from everything. I had an 8:00 am in the BSS and the morning hike took some getting used to, but it was refreshing in the mornings. I shared a room with someone and we had 6 guys in one suite(?) Not sure what it's called. I really enjoyed being that close to the forest. Definitely going to be using your gears if you ride a bike up it through.",

My only in person classes scheduled for Fall will be in the Fulkerson Recital Hall and MUSA 109 so how far would you say the walk would be from Creekview to these places?",

The hill is a bitch, but there\u2019s a bridge shortcut that will drop you off by the KBR. \n\nIt\u2019s very quiet. Since the pandemic, it\u2019s been a little more noisy from people hiking, but nothing noticeable. If you play Pok\u00e9mon Go, you can reach a gym from Juniper.",

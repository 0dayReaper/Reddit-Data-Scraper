    "postText": "I'm going to be a transfer student going into my junior year during Fall 2023, and am starting to poke around for housing a bit early to get a feel for prices and availability. I am looking into both on-campus and off-campus housing, and sharing a flat or unit isn't an issue. The main issue I have is sharing a room with people I don't know, and am trying my best to avoid it.\n\nSo, I was wondering if getting solo rooms either on campus or off campus is an achievable goal? If not, how do you guys deal with sharing a room with people?\n\nEdit 1/23/23: got my feelers out there and got some good responses and some times to send out emails! Even got to submit an application!! Thanks for all the help to thise who responded and hope this helps out other people looking for housing :)",

A couple months before you arrive you should know whether you are on campus or off. If you are off campus, start looking at Craigslist for upcoming apartments around then. \nI just transferred this past fall and was waitlisted for on-campus housing. I applied to over a dozen places, interviewed with 3 and was selected for 2.  This was for a June move-in date.  I managed to find a 1-bed apartment within walking distance to campus within your budget.",

It was not easy finding a place, especially because we have a cat. I was on Craigslist daily until I found something.

I managed to secure my place because I applied to a place that already had a lot of interest but the landlord had other properties including a place that was being renovated. I signed the lease before it was done and ever listed on Craigslist. If you apply to any places ask the landlord if they have any other properties that will be available soon and you might be able to get lucky and snag it before it\u2019s listed. Good luck!! Also, the school has a person who deals with off campus housing who can probably help you!",

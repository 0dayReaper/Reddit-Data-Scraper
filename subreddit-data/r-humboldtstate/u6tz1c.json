Was the contract written in crayon too? Come on.",

Great job by the USA Today for warning female students, staff and faculty of this man\u2019s horrific past!  Without it, the females on campus would have never known of what they are getting into by signing up for one of his classes or running into him on campus.  Kudos to this article and for providing a public safety tip and giving the general public and females a fair warning that Cal Poly Humboldt has a Professor walking around campus with a very toxic, if not dangerous past\u2026Many women are now placed out of harm\u2019s way after this article where they can avoid him on campus, so the article provided a great public service to the Humboldt Community!",

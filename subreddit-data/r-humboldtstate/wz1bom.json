    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a student currently studying Environmental Science down at CC in the San Diego area and I\u2019m interested in transferring up to Cal Poly Humboldt. My current goal is to transfer in to get a B.S. in Environmental Science and Management with a concentration on Ecological Restoration, but I recently learned about the Forestry B.S. with a concentration on Forest Restoration, which also speaks to my interests. My longterm career goal is to work with agencies/organizations on how to best preserve or restore natural forests and rangelands. \n\nI was curious to know which program in your experiences might be better suited for my goals and how they might vary?\n\nThanks so much in advance for your help :)",

You can do many different jobs with a natural resources based degree (none of my jobs post grad have been fish related). However, the forestry degree will make becoming a registered professional forester (RPF) much easier. I would suggest you look into the RPF requirements. RPFs do many different things from logging operations to the sort of restoration work you\u2019re interested it. It\u2019s a broad career field and a qualification that is currently in high demand. Either way Humboldt is a great school for natural resources programs so any choice you make will be a great one!",

            "comment": "I just transferred into the forestry restoration program! From what I have gathered, the forestry program is more applied and focused on forested ecosystems. You learn about industry economics, logging, forestry operations, and silviculture. They are training you to go into a very specific specialized field. It's definitely more logging focused (which is a important part of forest restoration and management). If you have any questions or want to chat, feel free to hmu!",

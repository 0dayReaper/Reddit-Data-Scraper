    "postText": "I'm living in my van and due to some electrical issues need a place to study with long hours.  On campus would be great but I've noticed most places close early.  Anything that has access to plugs for laptop is great and again... open early and late.  \n\nI'm open to off campus places but I'm trying to avoid driving (gas$) or restaurants (more $ and don't want to be that person who takes up too much real estate for paying customers). \n\nI quit my job and left behind a perfectly good home and loving wife to be here and really want to make this work. \n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.  If you're worried about ruining your favorite \nplace,   please DM me.\n\nUPDATE!!! CRISIS AVERTED\n\nI found a great resource for places on campus to study w/ locations and times for Fall 2021\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/15VRWElYANP9mHgg1HQ0r5CvbOHA-LGGk/view?usp=sharing\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1rJJTLH3YZCvSfyRfrKSbsLh00yEaxamD/view?usp=sharing",

You have made the mistake of writing \"ect\" instead of \"etc.\"\n\n\"Ect\" is a common misspelling of \"etc,\" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase \"et cetera.\" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as \"et\" to \"and\" + \"cetera\" to \"the rest;\" a literal translation to \"and the rest\" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase. \n\n[Check out the wikipedia entry if you want to learn more.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Et_cetera)\n\n^(I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Check out more here https://library.humboldt.edu/news/labsF21\nI go to scienceA because I called the library and the guy told me they open till 7:30 but after September 16th it will be open till 10:30. Tho usually I'm there till 8 no one has ever bothered me and most of the time I'm the only one there.",

Since you want to stay in Arcata, I'd try the Arcata Safeway/CVS and see if you can get wifi from your van.  It's not gonna be very fast, but I could still stream youtube.\n\nDoesn't solve your outlet issue unfortunately.  Study at the library as long as possible and then use your 3 hours minimum for late-night.  You can buy a powerbank that gets you some extra battery life for ~$100 (can't buy cheaper since you need the ac outlet not the usb outlet), but I know that might not be an option since you're on super budget.",

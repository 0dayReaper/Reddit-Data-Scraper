Something central, like...  directly above the main hangout eatery by the quad?\n\nThat said, my JC had Scantron vending machines at some of the outlying buildings - I would not be mad to see one of those crop up at the BSS/Native American Forum breezeway.",

My JC was the same... but then at CR, everyone *has* to use the most standard type (882E), and at both places the student government provides them for free.",

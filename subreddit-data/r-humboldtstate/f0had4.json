Does Humboldt accept your credits from the Fall semester right before? Because I won\u2019t have all of my requirements knocked out by then.",

You hear back if you got in around September, October and then after your semester ends you send your transcripts again with the fall classes included. Go spring transfers! There aren\u2019t too many but I felt like there was a definite bond people spring transfers when they met.",

Usually when you\u2019re purchasing transcripts there\u2019s an option you can check to pay for a second that will send out once the semester is done and your new grades are posted. If that\u2019s an option, do it so you don\u2019t forget!",

If you have more questions you can call them at 866.850.9556  or send them an email [hsuinfo@humboldt.edu](mailto:hsuinfo@humboldt.edu). Just note that they can be a little busy and the email might take a few days for a response.",

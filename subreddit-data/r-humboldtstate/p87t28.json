We\u2019re talking heavy stuff, like an old late \u201880s style portable computer (a kaypro). Got dropped off somewhere near the old movie theatre in Arcata. Then walked with all that crap, this was back when money was allergic to me, from the bus stop to the cafeteria. Man I was sweating by the time I got to the transfer apartments (pepperwood hall). But I digress\u2026",

    "postText": "Hi! So I was able to accept admission yesterday, but apparently I'm still only conditionally admitted??  Does this mean even though I accepted I might not be able to go? I don't have any outstanding actions to complete, and I was even able to sign up for orientation. Can someone explain? Is anyone else in the same boat??",

I was a transfer student and I sorta remember the same message... they make sure you get a bunch shots done before attending, and that will probably include the covid shot now. I don\u2019t think you need to worry, you just have some \u201cholds\u201d before physically attending (I think). I\u2019m sure if you call the advising center or whatever they can tell you what it means.\nAlso, if you did all that you needed to do, sometimes their system just takes a while to update. Sometimes you even need to call them to remind them to update it.",

Just in case you fail a needed credit, they can take back your acceptance. But sometimes it shows that even if you have completed all needed credits just because your account has to show that until summer hits",

Once summer hits or mid summer, it should go away. I know some of my peers stayed as conditionally until they made classes or until the fall semester was almost here. But our advisors swore up and down that it\u2019s okay and it\u2019s just how the system works.",

At the time, I hadn't fully completed my transfer requirements yet (but planned to my last semester at community college). So for me, the conditional acceptance was contingent on me passing those last few transfer requirements! Not sure if that applies to your situation but I hope it helps :')",

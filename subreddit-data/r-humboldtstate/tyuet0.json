    "postText": "Hey all, I was a transfer student for Fall 2020 but in the semesters since I've been living at home in socal to save money. I'm going back to campus this fall 2022 and I heard the dining hall caterers have changed, that there's an outsourced company or something in charge now?\n\nI was wondering what the quality is like. I enjoyed the food options in fall 2020 (especially that there was always something like pizza/grilled cheese to grab if I didn't like the rotated meal, I'm a picky eater) has it changed much?\n\nAlso do the serving hours still end at 7pm or was that a pandemic thing?\n\nWithout going too much into detail I have some mental health issues and forget to eat/will not cook when I don't have the energy (which is often) so I'm kinda relying on that dinner being a big easy food source for me.  Thanks!",

The first change? The bookstore company moved the campus bookstore off-campus. That is heresy in my book. They have a second bookstore in Old Town, Eureka and it's just comical because the place is always empty. Lots of bad decisions have been made.\n\nI predict in another decade when the current president moves on, the next president will have the sticky task of re-forming a local nonprofit to manage the bookstore and dining services. In the same vein, with Humboldt becoming a Cal Poly, I expect the academic programs the university shut down in the last two decades will have to be restarted at great expense, because there is a glaring need for them statewide and in this county (such as nursing and industrial technology).",

Hey Juan\u2019s portions are huge, $10 burrito is really 2 meals.  Los Bagels at end of day has bags and bags of half price bagels and pastries. (But Depot closes at 3pm) \n\nMarketplace has been bomb for a snack between classes, I can get a cup of fruit and yogurt and a coffee for about $5. + fresh locally made pastries. Oh almost forgot about library cafe. They re-opened. I\u2019m not sure what they have there besides coffee. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t answer your dinner question per say but, meals have been pretty yummy and definitely getting better, the new company is dialing it in.",

            "comment": "I find that the majority of the food at the J I've had so far (this is my second semester here) is flavorless or distasteful, personally, though I will say it has improved a bit. Last semester was worse. Breakfast is usually reliably good. Lunch is hit or miss. With dinner I'm lucky if I find one thing that I genuinely enjoy. It's usually the flavoring that is the issue, though there have been several times this semester when sides weren't cooked properly. \n\nI haven't seen any options like pizza and grilled cheese at the J. Your only options are the rotating meals or the J Grill. J Grill hasn't been that bad though some of the food is a bit bland. The Marketplace has been pretty good as well as the Depot options though. Really enjoy Bigfoot Burgers. However, you can only use the Flex dollars there or meal exchange.",

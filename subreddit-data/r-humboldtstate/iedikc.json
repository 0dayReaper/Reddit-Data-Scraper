    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI wanted to give you an update on the HSU Discord Server. It was originally posted to reddit 4 months ago but with how we've enhanced it, we wanted to share it again as a resource for students!\n\nI'm a current student at HSU, graduating this December. I also founded the PC Gaming Club back in 2018, and have been working with students, faculty, and administrators to build HSU's esports program since! Part of my advocacy for students and gaming includes creating a safe virtual communication space for the campus. This Discord server is also where you can get the most up to date information on the HSU Minecraft Server that is in the works!\n\nThis server is the best place to get feedback from your peers. While we have some HSU staff in the server, they will not respond via DM. Your best help for getting your personal questions answered related to admissions, finances, or grades will be through the respective offices on campus.\n\nWe have Discord Channels for RSOs or Student Clubs that we know have active Discord Servers. If you are part of a club not listed in the HSU Discord server, please contact Sarah and they will be happy to work on getting you connected.\n\nIf you are interested in joining the HSU Discord server, please click this link here:\n\n[discord.gg/7mqKVyU](https://discord.gg/7mqKVyU)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are having trouble accessing the server, or have additional questions, you are welcome to shoot me a message.",

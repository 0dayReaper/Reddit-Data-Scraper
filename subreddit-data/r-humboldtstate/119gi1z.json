Your town is amazing.  \nWith no housing security it\u2019s not a choice anymore. Now we\u2019re having to look at her other, less desired, choices.  How can a school say, yes come to school here and live in our dorm but only for a year.  You can sleep on the streets after that for all they seem to care.  \nI don\u2019t see solution\u2019s happening fast enough to relieve the problem. It\u2019s very sad.",

Currently even now there is available rooms in dorms and the rented hotels.\n\nNow they are bringing in other temporary housing measures and building additional campus dwelling as fast as they can.\n\nSo not sure why everyone is saying students will be homeless.",

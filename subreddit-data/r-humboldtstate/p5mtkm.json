    "postText": "Apologies if the answer is clear, but is there a schedule provided for when they begin and end serving at The J and other places to eat? It says online The J serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner at specific intervals, but while I found the menu, I can't find the posted times that these are available. And do the other locations have a set time schedule as well? I'm worried about the best way to get food if my classes take place during these time blocks.",

The hours are usually posted on the doors of the dining building, but I don\u2019t know how things look with covid. I believe besides the J the other options are mostly grab and go and don\u2019t close during the day. I haven\u2019t been a student in many years but I never (lol I\u2019m not underweight for sure) missed a meal due to a class time conflict. The only thing you\u2019ll need to keep in mind/look out for (and I feel like they cover this at orientation?) is just the points value of things, besides the J, the other options are more expensive so you\u2019ll need to budget your meal plan accordingly. Like if you\u2019re not near the J and have a small class break, you\u2019ll likely get something quick or packaged at one of the marketplaces, but that will be expensive.",

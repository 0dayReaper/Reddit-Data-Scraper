            "comment": "The best food on campus was pepperoni and cheese calzones, circa 1990-1993. In 1994, The J cafeteria changed the calzone recipe to one utilizing cheese made from the milk of Australian Tammar wallabies (that was the prevailing theory to explain the new flavor) and, despite an extensive protest deployed via furiously written notes on The J's bulletin board, and a monetary boycott of the newly reformulated 'calzones', the Golden Era of Calzones had come to an end.\n\nThere had been a collective ritual that took place on Tuesday afternoons as students ate two calzones at lunchtime and then splayed themselves out on their doom room floors, holding their bellies in ecstasy as the cheesy goodness began its Glorious Process of Digestion over the ensuing afternoon and evening hours. These calzones were so good that students bought extras and kept them in their dorm fridges to eat throughout the week.\n\nI have several close personal friends who became atheists in 1994 because no loving god would have allowed such human suffering to take place. No J employees were ever disciplined or fired over this culinary crime. It remains a dark, sad period in the lives of many alumni.",

They have a lot of good options there. I have to agree about the Marketplace serving up some good food, they make the best pizza on campus imo. And the deli sandwich makers make some mean sandwiches (they\u2019re amazing toasted) - they\u2019re a lot better over there with sandwich making than the J and the Depot. \n\nThe absolute worst meal I have ever had on campus was at The J when they were serving ramen. I don\u2019t waste food, but I could not finish it. The broth was watery, the noodles were mushy, and the toppings were sparse in selection. Can\u2019t say I expected much from ramen from the J but that was just shameful. I love the bulgogi sandwich they serve though, that has to be my favorite thing they serve there. I also love when they have spicy breaded wings.",

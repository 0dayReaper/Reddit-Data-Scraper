Murphys and Ray's are both good options too, both having their own respective +/-'s. Generally Safeway is the most straightforward and largest, probably best bet for cheaper produce in town too. Fuck wildberries; that's all I have to say about that place.",

            "comment": "1. Grocery Outlet in McKinleyville and Eureka. The stores acquire food at steep discount close to expiration (several weeks to 8+ months). The savings can sometimes be substantial. But, check expiration dates on everything to be sure you'll finish it in time. Certain foods are sold fresh, the same as you'll find in any other grocery store (milk, bread, salsa, tortillas, etc.), but with cost savings. Each store is independently owned. The McKinleyville location is a little more upscale, although slightly smaller in size.\n\n2. WinCo in Eureka. It's like applying coupons to everything you buy.\n\n3. Costco in Eureka if you need large quantities, although, you are paying for a $60 membership in the first place. For single people, Costco is best for non-food items such as toilet paper, paper towels, etc because you'll definitely use up what you buy. It helps if you have a friend who is a member and you just go with them. Your friend has to do the purchase though, because the cashier will sometimes ask who is buying when a person other than the member pays.",

Even when I was a single person I found out what I could use there before it would go bad, and household stuff like laundry soap will keep forever. (I remember it took me like 2 years to use 1 big laundry soap.) \nBut Winco is cheap, sometimes the quality isn\u2019t what you get elsewhere, but they will have packaged goods for half the price of other stores. Also they have a huge and comprehensive bulk section, candy to pet foods, and everything in between.",

They also cycle sales that if you time right you'll get a way better deal then anywhere else.. You just then need more available funds to afford fronting the bulk cost.",

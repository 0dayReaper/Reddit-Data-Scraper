One of my roommates is moving out &amp; we are searching for someone to move into their room staring in January. It is a smallish room but in a large house with a big backyard. We have some gardening boxes in the backyard as well if that interests you!! The rent is $550/month + utilities. The house is close to a bus stop, but is also only a 20min walk to campus. Please DM if interested!",

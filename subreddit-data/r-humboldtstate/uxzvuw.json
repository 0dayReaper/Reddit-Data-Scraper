    "postText": "My kid is looking to transfer out of JC soon into a business major. He's considering a variety of schools but I feel Humboldt would be a good fit for his personality.  Are there any business majors here that can shed light on the program? What made you pick Humboldt for business as opposed to other schools? How satisfied are you?\n\nOne more question, now that Humboldt is a Cal Poly is it switching to a quarter system?",

Most of the professors are great a few are not but that goes with every major. Over all pretty happy with my choice I however did not pick HSU for the business program I actually switched majors my freshmen year. I can say HSU doesn\u2019t fund the business program as much as the others as HSU is a more environment/forestry/sciences university. \n\nI didn\u2019t even know HSU was switching to a quarter system.",

Do you know is some of that Polytechnic cash will be getting invested in the business department?\n\n Rest easy, HSU is staying semester. SLO was on quarter system when we toured just 2 years ago. Pomona used to be as well. I thought that was the Poly's thing. However,  the opposite is true, all CSU's are now on semester.",

I\u2019d suggest San Diego State for business majors. That\u2019s where my brother went and it was excellent. Where does your kid want to go?",

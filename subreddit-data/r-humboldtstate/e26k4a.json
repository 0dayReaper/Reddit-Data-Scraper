Drive to an area of Arcata, McKinleyville, Blue Lake, or Eureka that isn't experiencing an outage. \n\nThe county-wide PSPS event is unlikely to occur again during the rainy season. \n\nAny other outage will be isolated, occurring around storm damage (e.g., trees being blown over onto power poles).  Drive to an unaffected area, get gas, eat at a restaurant, buy ice from a grocery store, etc.",

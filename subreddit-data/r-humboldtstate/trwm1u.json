If you have not declared a major, then you'll be paired with the [advisor for undeclared students](https://acac.humboldt.edu/students/advisor-undeclared-students).\n\nHere is more information about [academic plans](https://acac.humboldt.edu/students/academic-planning). You can also contact the [Academic &amp; Career Advising Center](https://acac.humboldt.edu/students).",

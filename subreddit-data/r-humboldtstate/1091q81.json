My question is, is Humboldt and the regions around racist? I would be open to hearing all the stories, I just want to have a clear picture of where I might be going.",

Most people in Arcata are some of the nicest I have ever met and it\u2019s an extremely beautiful place, however last year when I was walking home from class some kids from eureka followed me in their car and then got out and assaulted me calling me the n word. I only really had a black eye and was pretty much fine just shaken, someone also intervened to make sure I was ok and got pictures of the car, however the police didn\u2019t end up doing anything despite catching them. Despite that, I haven\u2019t really experienced anything else and still feel safe walking to school and around the town you just gotta be aware of your surroundings like anywhere else.",

If that's a concern then you should look into college demographics. \n\nHumboldt had a history of sundown towns and episodes of native genocide as well as Chinese exclusion, just like a lot of the country.",

You will likely deal with many micro aggressions and some ignorance on campus, mainly from peers, but to be honest I expected that from a predominantly white area so it wasn't a big shock. There are more people of color up here than I anticipated though which was cool. Around town in Arcata, people seem nice enough. College faculty has been fine and supportive.\n\n I've been told MicKinleyville is a sundown town and have been warned by people, even white people, not to hang around there. Some of my friends have said they felt pretty unsafe there. It's about 11 minutes from Arcata. There are some aggressively opinionated students that people like to pretend aren't on campus, but they're aggressive in that they wear poorly designed inflammatory shirts and want to talk about politics at a party when everyone else just wants to play Uno. \n\nSome people are kind of rude in Eureka, but for the most part it doesn't seem racially motivated. It sounds like they've been rude with everyone lol. As far as like violent racism or anything that made me feel genuinely unsafe, I haven't experienced it (yet). Overall people have been more welcoming than I thought they'd be.",

Arcata itself, especially the campus community is both tolerant in general and more diverse than anywhere else in the County. Yeah, there are bad apples in the County, especially purposefully ignorant, stressed, impoverished and at many times drugged out hill and or hood people who you could encounter just like anywhere else in the state. \n\nShould you be worried about racism as the main reason to worry about your safety? No. But it depends on the situations you put yourself in as many people have mentioned. If you hang out with other students in more or less controlled situations you'll most likely be perfectly safe. If you go to random parties in McKinleyville or a underground rave up in Kneeland or whatever there's a bunch of shaved head white dudes in red and white then pull a big fat NOPE and gtfo!- Not you would do that anyway because we want you to go to school here and have a fun, educational and safe time!",

There is a chance something will happen again this semester too.",

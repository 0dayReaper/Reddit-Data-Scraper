This spot is up just south of clam beach. It says no overnight camping but there are people they all the time. Check it out.",

Some are pretty obvious but they helped me \n\n1. Get a locker at the kinesiology/pool and you can use the shower there everyday. It's like $10 for the whole year.\n2. If you plan to live out of your car it's probably worth it to get a parking pass. I don't know about long term parking, technically overnight parking at the school isnt allowed but I saw plenty of van people who did it anyways. I stayed at the dollar tree parking lot on Giuntoli lane and no one ever bothered me besides a few crazy homeless people and it's only 5 minutes from the school. \n3. If you need some time to try it out and decide it's not for you, you can always apply for emergency temporary housing and look for apartments on Craigslist. \n4. Crack your windows open a little at night or else your car will get damp as hell. This is easier in the summer when it doesn't rain but once the rainy season comes you should get a rain guard for your windows \n5. Find some other fellow van dwellers, there's a pretty solid community at HSU and it's an easy way to make friends \n\nGood luck!",

I would buy a parking pass and park either near campus apartments or college creek.  They won't really bug you.  I did this for a small chunk of my time there.  Granted this was +5 years ago.",

They don\u2019t ever tell anyone they can\u2019t sleep there! It\u2019s pretty cool and seems to be pretty common knowledge to dry camp there! It\u2019s right next to the gym too so that\u2019s handy.",

    "postText": "The other day I made a friend in the library by simply playing chess in the brain break lounge. It made me wonder if there was a chess club on campus! Unfortunately, there is a not one anymore since going online. So, I am proposing we start up chess club again!\n\nBasic boards are not hard to come across. We can have analysis on real chess games or have a tournament between members to crowd around a match. To keep covid safe, of course we would be masked up and use sanitizers. We just need an advisor who also enjoys chess to sign off with the club and a decently sized room!\n\nI do not know how much traction this will get on the subreddit that likely very few checks. Please if you are interested DM me. We can get flyers going on campus to also let other chess enthusiasts know who do not see this post!",

    "postText": "Just wanted to rant about the fact that today is the deadline to drop classes instead of having to take an \"incomplete\" if you wish to leave a class after today. If I remember right, for both fall and spring semester last year the deadline was extended because the school was being more flexible considering we were fully-online. YET we're two weeks into the semester and in-person instruction is just now starting tomorrow. I don't understand how they expect students to have experienced a course sufficiently enough by now to know whether they want to drop it. I think it's inconsiderate of admin to not continue offering a deadline extension this semester especially if we are still operating under 'pandemic protocol' (online learning)",

            "comment": "Also having that day on holiday was the dumbest decision possible. It's also the last day to add a class, and the only person capable of giving me a permission number went on vacation on Thursday 9/2 until AFTER the add deadline. So now I'm having to go through the painful process of petitioning to add the class. My advisor, the professor, and the chair of the department have all been trying to get me into the class and it's just that one person in combination with it being a holiday weekend that held me back.",

    "postText": "hello, so i'm a senior in HS and i've been browsing the humboldt state website for an hour or so, but i haven't been able to get enough information on a few subjects. first off, are non-music majors allowed to participate in the symphonic band and orchestra here? in addition, it's to my understanding that general bio majors are not allowed to specialize in botany?\n\nin terms of dorms, do the freshmen dorms have kitchens, and if they don't, which meal plan is standard? and are there enough vegetarian/vegan options for me to live off of? thank you so much if you respond, i'm trying to get my shit together.",

It\u2019s more expensive, but less stressful in some aspects. I think you get more opportunities to make friends and be involved in campus activities with helps with engagement. I ended up leaving to go back home. I\u2019m back now as an older student, but I have a different mindset then before and wish I would have stayed on campus my first round.",

You\u2019ll end up paying less if you are a roommate in a house, plus you get your own room rather than sharing it with someone.",

Dorms are 10k-14k depending on what type of dorm you want, for only 9 months out of the year. (The meal plan is also crazy expensive for the type of food you get, especially if you\u2019re vegan.) \n\nRooms are fairly easy to find, and you can actually choose who you live with. Plus there are SO many houses within walking distance of HSU so it\u2019s not much different than the access you would get from a dorm. People say that living in a dorm is part of the \u201cexperience\u201d of going to college, but personally I had a lot more fun living with roommates in an actual house that I got to choose! I\u2019m sure some freshman are uncomfortable with the idea of having to get their own groceries and not pay their own bills in a lump sum, but it made me figure out adulthood faster than others.",

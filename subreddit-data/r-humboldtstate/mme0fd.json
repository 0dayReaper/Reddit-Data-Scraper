Definitely see the community redwood forest, it's gorgeous and there are no covid restrictions obviously. All the buildings were closed when I was there, but we kinda looked in some windows (the gym is really nice!) and just wandered around getting the feeling of campus. And like other commenters said, it's worth calling and checking to see what current restrictions are in place and whether they would let you get around any of those as a prospective student. Good luck!",

Eureka park is the nicer outdoor park by far in the immediate area, smooth concrete, and overall larger layout; has multiple features for beginners and regulars. There\u2019s also RampArt skatepark, it is pay per hour but it\u2019s the only indoor skating in Humboldt (plus they have some sick shows every once and again)",

            "comment": "The housing handbook has this info: \n\n\nSkating/Bicycles/Hoverboards\nSkateboarding, hoverboards, roller blades, in-line skating, bicycling, and scooters are prohibited in the interiors of all facilities, around the exterior of the JGC, in the Hill quad, College Creek courtyards and on walkways, catwalks, fire lanes (Creekview, Hill, Campus Apartments), and access roads. Such activities pose a safety threat to people and potential damage to facilities. Additionally, skateboarding is limited on campus as well. Please refer to the University Code of Rules and Regulations to read about the campus skateboarding policy (Section 3407).\nDue to safety concerns, hoverboards are banned at Cal Poly Humboldt.\n\n\nAlso the link to the campus police guidelines are from 1999, lol. \n\n3407. Riding and Operation of Skateboards. It shall be the responsibility of every person bringing a skateboard, roller skates, roller blades or toy vehicle onto the university campus, to operate their equipment only in those areas that are not prohibited. Prohibited areas are\n20\nrev. 3/8/00\n\nregulated by signing or fall under other statutes.\n(a) No person shall ride upon or operate any skateboard, roller skates, roller blades or toy vehicles upon any of the streets or traffic ways of the university campus, except as a pedestrian in a crosswalk, subject to the laws pertaining thereto. Parking lot areas are considered traffic ways.\n(b) Operation of skateboards, roller skates, roller blades or toy vehicles in any building is prohibited at all times.\n(c) No person shall operate a skateboard, roller skates, roller blades or toy vehicles on benches, stairs, drainage ditches, building walls, planters, curbs, or any other like objects on the university campus.\n(d) No person shall operate any motorized skateboard at any time on the university campus.\n(e) No person shall operate a skateboard, roller skate, roller blades or toy vehicle in any manner as to endanger pedestrians. Pedestrians shall have the right of way at all times.\n\nI don\u2019t personally think skateboarding is a crime, just linking what the campus policies are.",

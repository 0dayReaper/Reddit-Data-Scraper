    "postText": "Hey guys so I\u2019m gonna be living on campus, in a double in Canyon &amp; was wondering if the loft beds can be converted to regular level bed/ or atleast  shortened? And if that\u2019s allowed? I move so much in my sleep &amp; have heard of how much of a hassle loft style beds are so I\u2019m getting a lil stressed out lol.\nEdit* \nIf you guys have any advice for what kind of supplies for class/living please lmk what I should invest in!! Thanks:)",

I don't know what you mean by shortening your bed, but your bed length doesn't change. I doubt you can disassemble your loft bed because all of your room's furniture needs to stay in you room and your room isn't *that* big.\n\nThere is a [what to bring list](https://housing.humboldt.edu/resident-resources/moving-in) halfway down that linked page.\n\nHere is a more robust [old moving in guide](https://housing.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/move-in_guide.pdf). Ignore all dates contained in it. By appearances, this guide was made pre-pandemic, so other information may have changed as well.",

I obviously don't know how high the beds are, but I would be surprised if they're so high that you cannot sit up in them.\n\nLook at [this photo](https://housing.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/styles/kalapicture_6_breakpoints_kalapicture_screen-lg_1x/public/canyon_2016.jpg?itok=DYQu70Ca). It seems like there's plenty of space. You have to be able to get into bed in the first place while on your hands and knees.",

Overall if it is a single bed lifted up then they might do it more often then not. Also for living supplies bring a tool box/kit like a cheap one from Amazon that has everything in it, as well as room cleaning supplies. The mold in Canyon is crazy so cleaning your room is a must. Shower shoes are a must just buy like 99 cent store flip flops. Wall plug-ins to make your room smell good is another big one. Also make the space your own, you will miss home and you will want a space that feels like yours. In Canyon fans are a must so bring like 2 or 3 it will be hot in Canyon I'm talking like 80\u00b0+ when it is like 50\u00b0 outside. Finally a vacuum they provide one but your own will be better lol.",

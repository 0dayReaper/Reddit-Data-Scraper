    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI was accepted to attend Humboldt Uni for Fall 2021, I've received my portal log-in and I've been diligent with checking my \"to-do\" list. Currently, my to-do list shows Humboldt is requesting two letters of recommendations from an academic reference. I've never heard of this being requesting for transferring students. The due date is by Jan 15th and I am having a hard time getting responses from those I've requested letters from. My question is: who can I contact regarding the letters of recommendation request? I think I will need a deadline extension for this. \n\nAlso, why is this being requested from me (as a transfer student). The other colleges I've applied to throughout Cali have not requested this.\n\nAny information or tips are much appreciated. Thank you.",

I knew I wasn\u2019t going to find 2 counselors/professors/advisors in these next days so I just sent an email to both EOP and admissions saying if I can withdraw my EOP application. Look for the details on the \u201cto-do\u201d list. If it\u2019s not EOP then I am not sure. If it is EOP, send an email, they got back to me in the same day.",

    "postText": "Hello my name is John and I am looking to room with someone on campus next semester. I am 21 years old, fully vaccined, and I am a psychology major in my 3rd year of university. I need to be on campus next semester due to the fact I have classes on campus. I am currently #10 on a wait list but I am worried I might not get in. Please feel free to email me at jpc68@humboldt.edu for more information about myself and if you think we could be roommates.",

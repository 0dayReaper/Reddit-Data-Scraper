If it was just HSU, we could make an argument for it but it's not. It's everyone. \n\nIf they allowed withdrawal at this point, I could see the argument for a reimbursement, but they're not. They're continuing on and struggling just like everyone else in the world. Our situation is not special, nor is it due to HSU itself.",

I will miss my weekly labs in the ACF and elsewhere, i will surely miss my one day weekend field trips and I am super bummed about missing our extended overnight weekend field trips. one of my summer field courses was cancelled as well (it was refunded...)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nall in all this is one big trip for the whole world. how we handle it and how we move into the future is a huge reflection of our character. we can move forward with a positive attitude and grace, learn and spread better/more effective ways to be humans. OR, we can move forward holding onto bitterness, anger and resentment. we have a chance to learn from this. while this event is very impactful in many ways, I truly believe we will be able to look back on this period of time as a learning experience for both ourselves and for humanity in general (or at least I hope so)",

They've already put a moratorium on evictions locally, and some other countries have suspended loan repayments until the crisis is over.  \n\nI agree there's no chance at this *just* happening locally, but if there's a strong enough push for it, colleges may seek help from state and federal government to do exactly this.",

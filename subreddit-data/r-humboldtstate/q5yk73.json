    "postText": "Has anyone heard any updates on the rules surrounding the ban on guests in residence halls? The most recent info (September 3rd) said the policy would be in effect until October 10th. Seems odd to me that they've already opened up the campus to large indoor events but we still can't have people over for dinner in our apartments. Although I don't think many people are following this rule.",

As an employee, I was charged for parking in the library staff lot between the end of spring semester and the start of summer semester. I got the ticket tossed out. They then changed the parking policy to ticketing year-round.\n\nFWIW, the cutoff for weekday parking used to be 9 p.m. The other hours haven't changed.",

I got pulled over for hopping my bike off the curb into the library circle, about midnight on a Sunday.  Then the campus cop wrote me up for running three stop signs in town.  I won in court, but fuck you, Officer Babcock. \n\n(I've been waiting a few decades to say that!)",

I have a friend that got harassed by campus police while he was on his bike for slowly rolling the 3-way-intersection that HGH sits on the corner of. Nobody else was around and it was just a parked cop car. The cop demanded he give him all his info because he was certain he had pulled him over before and wanted to write a repeat violation. They love to write those tickets",

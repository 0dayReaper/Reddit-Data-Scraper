The Boba shop is not going to make a profound impact on your lifetime earning potential or happiness in your career, hopefully college will.\n\nWhether you come up now or later, do what you already know you need to do to avoid getting sick en route. Moving and school are hard enough, the last thing any student needs is being sick in the middle of all that. Doing so now when you can take your time may enable you to take more precautions, instead of waiting until the middle of the year. I'm sure there would be perks to waiting too, like hopefully knowing more about how this will play out.\n\nGood luck! If you end up out here and things go sideways, please reach out for support.(If you don't have a network already.)",

I definitely don't want to go to a school that will just disregard its students in such an extreme and unexpected way. A friend of mine got hit with this as an existing student and they're rightfully pissed off. I need to go to a college where I will have a home for 4 years. I don't feel like I have a right to steal someone else's existing home. I think if enough freshmen showed their solidarity by withdrawing their applications, it could be a major blow to the school's current plans. Is anyone else considering this?",

            "comment": "I do genuinely think that as an incoming Freshman, looking at how a university handles situations that could impact you in the future is important and a reasonable cause to choose a different college. I have no issue with the change in housing policy itself but the way the rug was pulled out from under returning students so last minute speaks to a level of indifference the university seems to have towards student wellbeing and success. \n\nIncoming students should ask themselves if they want to risk experiencing that kind of setback. I'm no expert of course so I don't know what the numbers are actually like, but it seems like they've been overadmitting students, so if by chance you are unable to get into dorms, the competition for housing will be rough. Securing housing up here was already a pain before so I imagine it will only get worse.",

I came here to live on campus, not live in a motel, hotel, or even a barge (don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with that, hoping it\u2019s just a rumor). From a business standpoint, I understand CPH. They think this issue will be resolved over time but ignore that me and my roommates are being impacted by this right now. I love my roommates and I wanted to stay with them for the rest of my education here, but I am thinking about going back home because being here doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. I\u2019m paying out of state tuition to live in a motel, there\u2019s never any parking, having a meal plan wouldn\u2019t make sense for me anymore if I don\u2019t live on campus, and I\u2019d be separated from my friends.\nThe parking is a whole other issue, yesterday I was 5 minutes late out of my last class and had to wait 30 minutes to find a spot where I live (I\u2019ve waited an hour before during last semester, but that was after my earliest class). Ive already heard students say they\u2019re considering living in their cars, which could make this problem even worse. Also I don\u2019t know what their plan is for kitchens at the motels/hotels, some of my roommates have dietary needs and idk what they\u2019re supposed to do about that??

It's normal for students to transition to off-campus housing eventually. In my time, very few students lived all 4 to 6 years on campus. Myself, I stayed 3 years and was surrounded by younger students that third year.  It's more expensive to live on campus and you have fewer freedoms in terms of your living situation, which is something you work out the longer you stay.",

            "comment": "I'm a current CPH student, and I really reccomend this. CPH has a HIGH rate of homelessness and you often see students living in vans or under the bridge. I have never been able to find off-campus housing or a job that pays enough to do so in the first place. And I'm not the only one- most students can only work part-time, and unless you can find a house pre-filled with roommates, it's not an affordable option. \n\nThe housing that already exist sucks. Mold, old stoves and fridges that constantly break, super-thin walls. If it's an option for you, go somewhere close to home so you can live with your parents.",

            "comment": "You can defer admission by a term at least, postponing the pain, or limiting it to 2-3 terms instead of 4 or more, depending on when dorm housing gets built  (2025 I believe). My understanding is that the housing will only allow them to offer a room to all freshmen, not others, so off campus will happen in year 2+ most likely even 2025+\nYou can also accept enrollment and do up to a year or so elsewhere at another CSU I think, though you should go over the classes and number of allowable credits carefully w/ an advisor. This could help some of you avoid the hassles,  both freshmen and older students (can study at another CSU up to a certain number of credits but still graduate from CPH).\n\nhttps://csumb.edu/planning/take-course-another-csu/",

            "comment": "This housing announcement is disappointing; however, I would overall categorize CPH as an excellent school that tries hard to put its students first. All of my profs have been amazing (I\u2019m finishing up my last semester here right now) and I have felt genuinely supported by the faculty here the whole time I\u2019ve been attending (since 2019). The housing issue is nothing new, but housing is an issue in many college towns, and I don\u2019t think it should dissuade students from coming here when CPH excels in so many other ways. I personally had no difficulty getting a dorm my first year or finding an apartment close to campus after moving off campus, but I know that this hasn\u2019t been the case for everyone. I personally don\u2019t believe that boycotting the school is the way to go\u2014all schools have their issues and downsides\u2014and I think you could be missing out on a great college experience if you choose not to go here for that reason. I wish you the best of luck wherever you go!",

    "postText": "You see, I took beginning band in high school to learn the xylophone (it was the one that is a medium size between the vibraphone and marimba). However, in March or April of 2020 we had to stop in-person classes due to covid. At that point, since I couldn't take the big xylophone home to practice, I just didn't do anything more for this class. The band teacher was fine with this as I just focused on practicing my instrument for my other band class.\n\nThis fall, I am considering taking beginning percussion/MUS 108P at Humboldt so I can relearn the xylophone. However, I am now second thinking this. Surely much of it will overlap with what I already learned, right? It is only 2 hours a week for one semester instead of 5 hours a week for 1.5 semesters (the one in high school). Although, surely the college class will be more rigorous, especially since we will all be learning percussion in that class. The beginning band in my high school had people learning wind instruments as well, not to mention plenty of rowdy freshmen.\n\nI don't know what to do. I mean I know logically that I shouldn't take this class, at least not this semester as I already have 16 other units and I have horrible time management skills. However, MUS 108P is just a freshman-level 1-unit class, so surely it is not too much, right? I mean it sounds like fun. But I can just play xylophone at my own house (I have tiny 9-note one with only one mallet, but I could a somewhat bigger one on amazon for under $100.) Ok actually I do know I should drop this class but it is kinda sad because I was really looking forward to it. But I can just practice at home. Not to mention I will also be in intermediate orchestra so I will already get to play in a band with others.",

I was just worried because I have previously not done well with over 16 units in a semester. but that was a different time and place. I don't think adding a fun 1 unit class will change that much.",

    "postText": "Currently I am still in 11th grade but I was starting to look into colleges and I really liked Humboldt. However with the new housing issues i'm a little worried. It's likely I can get on campus housing for the first year but from what I can tell its very hard to get continuing on. BUT also it says that they will have 900 new beds about a mile from the school by 2025 which is when I will be a sophmore. Is it realiable to trust the new dorms will actually be completed by then? Thanks so much!\n\nWhere I got the info: [https://facilitymgmt.humboldt.edu/craftsman-student-housing](https://facilitymgmt.humboldt.edu/craftsman-student-housing)\n\n[https://www.humboldt.edu/polytechnic/infrastructure-projects](https://www.humboldt.edu/polytechnic/infrastructure-projects)",

Housing always going to be a problem like at many other colleges in California. You are seeing our University is having growing pains unfortunately. There's more student housing as yet to be announced as well. Overall its s good reason to be worried but I wouldn't let that scare you away based on the time you plan to be attending.",

            "comment": "This housing announcement is disappointing; however, I would overall categorize CPH as an excellent school that tries hard to put its students first. All of my profs have been amazing (I\u2019m finishing up my last semester here right now) and I have felt genuinely supported by the faculty here the whole time I\u2019ve been attending (since 2019). The housing issue is nothing new, but housing is an issue in many college towns, and I don\u2019t think it should dissuade students from coming here when CPH excels in so many other ways. I personally had no difficulty getting a dorm my first year or finding an apartment close to campus after moving off campus, but I know that this hasn\u2019t been the case for everyone. All schools have their issues and downsides, and I think you could be missing out on a great college experience if you choose not to go here for that reason. I wish you the best of luck wherever you go!",

I used to work at the university when I was a student there and even trying to just claim individual rooms for necessary services would end with nothing due to failures in communication. There are building projects that never got off the ground and others that were pushed through opportunistically when nobody was looking by admin. There are excellent well-intentioned people working there who genuinely want to help students, but often many of them are not actually calling the shots. Admin is an absolute disaster that's terrible at communicating and with how they operate, they will either spin their wheels FOR YEARS or push something through immediately with little input. Currently I can't especially tell yet if the new dorms will be the former or the latter So it's honestly a gamble. Good luck in your decision tho",

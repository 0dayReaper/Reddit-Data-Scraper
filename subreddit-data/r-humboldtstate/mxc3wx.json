    "postText": "Hi. I plan on majoring in english. I plan to take 18 units a semester because I want to graduate in three years, since I already spent a year elsewhere. I'm going to be taking spanish and french through level four for the first four semesters. The rest of my semesters will consist of English major courses (mostly creative writing) and GE. I have finished all of ge area A and my math, one social science and two humanities, so I don't have too many left. I'll take geology and botany for my sciences. Psci, ahss, ws, crgs, and art (graphic design) to fulfill the rest of lower division. And then of course upper division ge. Has any one taken 18 units as a liberal arts major? How hard or average or easy was it in your experience?\n\nI would say I'm pretty good at managing my time when it comes to school. I won't be working so all my time will be given to school work. And of course the occasional exploration around the forest but that's not as important to me. I just don't know how overwhelming 18 units gets! Any advice?\n\nTLDR: English major, planning on taking 18 units a semester, need to know how hard that is.",

If you want to work in the film industry, you need to go to a school that is connected to it. USC is the only reliable avenue that I know of to get into the movie industry via education. \n\nHowever, HSU is a great place to learn a creative skillset. I made an in-camera edit 8mm film for a Visual Communication class, and it remains one of my favorite school projects. The range of natural settings is incredible in Humboldt, I worked on a project for scouts to discover shooting locations. \n\nThere aren't many big-city distractions, so you have to make your own amusements.",

Professors are pretty lax, and understand that shit happens in the film world meaning half the time your projects won\u2019t come in on schedule. I found the classes informative and feel like my quality in projects improved significantly with each class. It was a great time, and I\u2019d highly recomen the experience.",

Cypress is very underrated I like cypress the best great location if you don\u2019t mind the stairs. Canyon and campus apartments are the worst ones the hill is okay I guess. Never lived in creek view but it looks nice",

The JGC houses a recreation room, convenience store, the housing offices, a mail room, meeting rooms, and the cafeteria. \"The J\" is the cafeteria.\n\n* The Canyon\n\n* Cypress\n\n* The Hill\n\nIn that order. If fact, I believe first year students are preferred to live in those residence halls.\n\nThe Canyon and The Hill offer a traditional dorm experience with a lot of students per floor (The Canyon less than The Hill), which is great for making friends. If that weirds you out, then choose Cypress, but if you don't like the small batch of people in your housing unit, yeah, should have chosen The Canyon.",

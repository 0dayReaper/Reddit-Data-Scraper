Also if anyone has any info on the courses I'll be taking I have a pretty light courseload this semester and would love to be able to read/study topics ahead since I have free time. Any other tips/ideas are greatly appreciated.",

The courses are pretty beginner friendly as the start, but the main language you will use will be C++. At first I was a little bit hesitant about the program because it was really small, but I ended up loving the courses and the professors. \nMy best piece of advice is, go to office hours when you can, and start homework early so you have tome to practice and learn.",

I figured the language was c++ I'm doing some extra data structures studying and want to make sure I practice in the language used at HSU. I was a little concerned about the program size too but I figured it's not a huge deal. And definitely appreciate the advice with hw and going to office hours. I'll keep this all in mind glad to hear some good stuff.",

            "comment": "Hello,\n\nI took CS 111, the intro to CS course at HSU, maybe 2 semesters ago? From it I have some knowledge about what languages are mostly used in CS courses at HSU. I also have knowledge about languages used in other HSU courses.\n\nIn CS 111 the first half of the semester was in [Racket](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)) and the second in C++. This 50/50 split for CS 111 is the norm. From comments of my professor from CS 111 it seems most CS courses at HSU are in C++.\n\nIt seems most if not all statistics courses at HSU are in R.\n\nIn the non-statistical math classes Ive taken at HSU, the languages used are usually chosen to be class specific. For some calc classes my professors may use MATLAB, for my algebra class this semester, my textbook has us using [SageMath](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SageMath), and in my upper division geometry course we had used something called [Geogebra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoGebra) (if you would consider this a language). \n\nI don't have a lot of specific info about CS at HSU that isn't CS 111 specific unfortunately. Ask me some questions if you have any, and with you being a transfer... Im a junior math major, maybe that info will help you tailor questions or something. \n\nGood luck when classes start.",

I don't have too many non cs questions other than I hope campus is open this fall lol. I do need to find a place to rent but I've seen some sources here already. If there's anything you think is important to know for someone that hasn't physically been to HSU I'm open to hearing tho.  \n\nThanks for the info and good luck to you too!",

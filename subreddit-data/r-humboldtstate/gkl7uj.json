    "postText": "Hi all! I hope you are well. I will be transferring to HSU in the fall, and am going to try to live in off-campus housing. The school has been kind of vague about which classes will be on campus and which will remain online. But since I am an art major I figure we are probably going back to physical classes since we need the studio space.\n\nAnyways, I have read that finding housing in the area can be difficult, so I wonder when is the best time to start looking? Also, where are the best places to look? And which websites are the best? (I have heard some people on this subreddit saying to avoid craigslist while others praise it...)\n\nThank you!",

Visit their websites. Look at their rental listings.\n\n&gt; The school has been kind of vague about which classes will be on campus and which will remain online.

It's a pandemic. The chancellor's office wants online classes. HSU has [requested a hybrid approach](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2020/may/12/hsu-says-it-will-request-hybrid-approach-online-le/), but the decision is the chancellor's to make.",

It wasn't difficult... but I'm not sure if that's a function of the time I was looking, or housing not being as impacted as it is now.\n\nUnder normal conditions, I'd recommend looking now so you can spend a summer here, enjoying our summer events and modest weather. But of course, all major events are canceled through August so far, so the summer could be really, really low-key, but I guess that's true of everywhere else in California. \n\nThe safe bet is to secure an apartment by June or July. I'm not informed on what communications the university has with you, what it's planning for in-person classes. I mean, what happens if no in-person classes are allowed? You'd take only non-art classes your first year getting a lot of your general education courses out of the way? I don't envy the decisions you have to make. I'd hope for clarity from the university in the next few weeks.",

You could try emailing your advisor to see if they have any inside info about hybrid classes. A lot of students left their leases early, so finding housing now was slightly easier than in the past. When do you plan on moving up here? Will you have a car? Do you want to live close to campus? Do you want a studio apartment or are you okay rooming with people?",

I would be moving up there in mid August, but yeah, it will depend on what the school says. I will have a car and am flexible in terms of roommates or not. I'm just trying to figure out when to start looking because I just don't want to have to frantically search for housing at the last minute.",

There\u2019s lots of apartments, Strombeck, Kramer, Danco are some of the bigger name landlords in Arcata, all should have openings because declining enrollment is really declining now so it\u2019s definitely not the crazy rental market it used to be.\nEdit:\nKeep in mind looking can take a bit and when you\u2019ve got to do all the paperwork and walk through remotely, it can add some extra time and hassle. Rentals will advertise when the lease starts, so hopefully you can get something starting Aug 1, so you\u2019re not paying rent when you don\u2019t live there.",

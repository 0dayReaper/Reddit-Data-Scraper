Some of us have to start filling out housing applications and it\u2019s so hard to arrange that when it\u2019s still in the air.. \nThoughts? \nAnyone also feel kinda conflicted on whether or not to plan for an in person semester?

They have some concerns about the how quickly the vaccine was approved and the stories about people have sever reactions\n\nI think that\u2019s a fair concern to have. On average, it takes about 9 years to develop a vaccine. The COVID vaccines were developed in 9 *months*. There\u2019s almost no data on long term effects (good or bad) and no one is sure about how effective it will be against new strains like those that originated in England and South Africa, only anecdotal evidence based off similar diseases/ vaccines. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not like the vaccine will stop you from becoming infected, but rather mitigate the symptoms so you hopefully don\u2019t require medical care. Plus, there\u2019s the whole \u201cHold Harmless\u201d agreement you\u2019re supposed to sign prior to getting the vaccine, so if you do have a negative reaction now or in the future, you can\u2019t hold the pharmaceutical companies or the government liable.\n\nAll that considered, I can understand why some would be hesitant. Even more so if they\u2019re in a demographic with a 99.99% survival rate, as I assume most college students are.",

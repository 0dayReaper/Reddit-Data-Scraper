Free software, make the flashcards on your laptop or desktop, and if you download the app on your phone, it syncs and you can use them on either your laptop or your phone. Totally free software and it has an algorithm that randomizes the flashcards depending on how well you remember them. Seriously, it has SAVED me. Highly recommend.\n\nEdit: I misread this a little and I see you're trying to randomize lecture slides for studying? You might be able to upload .ppt to Anki (it has a ton of functions) but if not, you could just take screenshots of the slides and upload them to the flashcards and randomize them that way. I've done that before. Either way, best of luck!",

Still doesn't work. \n\nI don't get where this isn't working.  Maybe it's a windows 11 thing or it's operator error.\n\nI don't know if it makes a difference, but my slides are animated.",

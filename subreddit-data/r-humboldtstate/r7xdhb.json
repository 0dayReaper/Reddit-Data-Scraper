I really wanted to stay and try and settle here in the nature after I grad but now I\u2019m really glad this my last year and I and my loved ones can move somewhere where we feel safer in California.\n\nThis happened around about 20 minutes before sunset around the pinned location in the middle of the paved trail. People were on the trail and it felt safe before, but I was rather isolated/ alone in my area  when this happened.\n\nMaybe reconsider going to this trail as a person of color especially with all the seemingly shifty figures that always live and dart in and out the bushes on that Trail, which now we know some are dangerous racists\n\nSorry if this feels like a word vomit and uncoordinated but I still feel jumpy about an hour later back home cause I really feel like that was a possible brush with death if I made the wrong move there and didn\u2019t run",

I can see that trail getting sketchy because there's so much cover for people to hide in during some of those sections with thick growth on either side. If you ever want to ride with two other dudes if that makes you feel safer, lmk. My friend and I love cycling from campus to Eureka along Old Arcata and Myrtle, then doing that waterfront trail.",

You walk in, sit down, get up when your name is called, and walk across the stage as you've seen everyone else do before you. I didn't have a practice, but graduates were told what to do and it was straight-forward. In my time, while waiting to walk across the stage, you handed someone a card that had your name the way you wanted it pronounced.",

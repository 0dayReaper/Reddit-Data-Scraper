            "comment": "[Here's](http://now.humboldt.edu/news/hsu-set-to-receive-884-acre-forest/) the full announcement, but longstory short - HSU is about to receive a big chunk of nearby Jacoby Creek Forest. It's got old-growth cedar, second-growth redwoods, spotted owl, at least one waterfall, and lots of riparian habitat. It will be an amazing classroom, and this is a big deal academically and ecologically. \n\nOpening it up will affect lots of majors: Geology, Fisheries, Environmental Sciences and Management, Wildlife, Native American Studies, Anthropology, Forestry, Soils, and Recreation Management, among others. And just *having* the forest will make it easier to get grants for future endeavors. \n\nThis project has been in the works since 2012 and uses a combo of grants &amp; gifts to fund it. It also protects the watershed: there was concern that those contiguous parcels would get broken up into what's described as 'non-forestry' use.  ",

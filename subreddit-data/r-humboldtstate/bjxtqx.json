    "postText": "Research, volunteerism, athletics, clubs... it's stunning how much this year's Outstanding Students were able to accomplish during their time here. And check out the research topics down at the bottom of this wall-o-text. \n\nIf you see a winner before school's out, congratulations are in order. :)\n\n[http://now.humboldt.edu/news/humboldt-states-outstanding-students-of-2019/](http://now.humboldt.edu/news/humboldt-states-outstanding-students-of-2019/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Outstanding Students of the Year for Outstanding Academic and Co-curricular Contributions**:\n\n**Mary Elise Conzelmann** has served the public and fostered collaborations to create healthy communities. As a Recreation Administration major, she has presented at professional recreation conferences, published research, been a member of the HSU women\u2019s rowing team, worked multiple part-time jobs, and volunteered throughout her undergraduate education.\n\nConzelmann has engaged in her community by volunteering with the Humboldt Bay Trail Fund Committee, Bike Month Humboldt, Women\u2019s Rally Group, and North Bay Rotaract. In her first year at HSU, she re-activated the Recreation Administration Club and served as president for two years. During that time, she was awarded a grant to host a Cultural Diversity Workshop for campus and community members.\n\nShe is currently volunteering with the Redwood Community Action Agency and Humboldt County Association of Governments on a traffic stress assessment in McKinleyville. This assessment will help local officials and planners understand the roadways in McKinleyville and hopefully encourage the development of safer paths for biking.\n\nA member of the Humboldt State Women\u2019s Rowing team, she has demonstrated leadership and is currently collaborating with the US Coast Guard, HSU Center Activities and the Admissions department to create a video that will educate newly admitted students on local waterway safety.\n\nConzelmann will complete her degree in three years at Humboldt State and will pursue her M.S. in Management at Saint Mary\u2019s College of California.\n\n**Tanya Garcia** has shown exemplary commitment to her double majors in Environmental Resources Engineering and Math, as well as the broader STEM community during her tenure as an undergraduate at Humboldt State University. She co-founded the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, a student-run club that seeks to promote academic excellence among Latinx engineers, and has served a number of leadership roles.\n\nGarcia is also committed to Engineers without Borders, and participated in a service trip to Nicaragua where she and fellow engineering students worked with professional engineers to install a water well for a rural hospital. Fluent in Spanish, she also served as translator for the group. She was awarded the \u201cEngineers without Borders Excellence in Service\u201d award for her work.\n\nIn addition to her work through student organizations, Garcia has been an active source of academic support to her peers. She served as a Jeffrey S. Navarro engineering peer mentor from 2017-2018, providing academic, professional, and personal support to a cohort of sophomore engineering students. She has volunteered for local math competitions and science fairs, and has also spoken publicly at a number of events to advise peers. Throughout her tenure as an undergraduate, she was a frequent volunteer at admitted student events.\n\nGarcia currently works for the Schatz Energy Research Center on improving access to services among people who live off-grid. She wants to be a leader and an educator and expand access to energy and water in low-income communities in the country and abroad.  \nMary Elise Conzelmann (left), a senior majoring in Recreation Administration, and Tanya Garcia, a senior double majoring in Environmental Resources Engineering and Math.  \nOther Awards Presented at the May 1 ceremony:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6v2yysxb4uv21.jpg?width=6096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=10c6c3cce5e5b5a095889ed2203062d18ef3e4de\n\n**Excellence in an Academic Discipline: College of Arts Humanities &amp; Social Sciences**  \nShanti Belaustegui\u2014Environmental Studies\n\n**Excellence in an Academic Discipline: College of Professional Studies**  \nHaley Miller\u2014Kinesiology\n\n**Excellence in an Academic Discipline: College of Natural Resources &amp; Sciences**  \nAmanda Agosto Ramos\u2014Biology\n\n**Outstanding Artistic Achievement in Visual &amp; Performing Arts**  \nJen Kelly\u2014Journalism and Physics\n\n**Al Elpusan Award for Student Activism**  \nChristian Boyd\u2014Political Science\n\n**Outstanding Contribution to a Campus Club or Organization**  \nMichael Magana\u2014Economics\n\n**Excellence in Community Service (Off-Campus)**  \nMarlene Medina\u2014Social Work\n\n**Excellence in Sports Club**  \nKarsten Hayes\u2014Environmental Resources Engineering\n\n**Outstanding Contribution to an Associated Students Program**  \nIsabel Jazlin Sanchez-Pacheco\u2014Business Administration\n\n**Excellence in Intercollegiate Athletics**  \nFrancisco Calderon\u2014Criminology &amp; Justice Studies\n\n**Brian Lorensen Residence Life Staff Award**  \nJose Balderrama\u2014Business Administration   \nAlexis Brown\u2014Political Science  \nKawai Navares\u2014Forestry  \nMikayla Kia\u2014Environmental Science &amp; Management; International Studies\n\n**Recipients of the McConkey Outstanding Graduate Student Awards**\n\nAlexis Bernal\u2014Natural Resources  \nCatherine Boers\u2014English   \nMolly Hilgenberg\u2014Social Work   \nAlexandria Jaurique\u2014Psychology  \nKristian Salgado\u2014Environment &amp; Community   \nAngel Lomeli\u2014Kinesiology  \nGrant Skoglund\u2014Applied Anthropology  \nSamantha Silver\u2014Sociology\n\n**HSU\u2019s Outstanding Student Researchers**\n\nJessie Armendariz, graduate, Kinesiology  \n\u201cEffects on Wild Blueberry Drink on Fat Oxidation During Cycling in Healthy, Active Males\u201d  \nFaculty Advisor: Taylor Bloedor, Kinesology\n\nAdriene Bouissou and Ian Cullimore, undergraduates, Biological Sciences  \n\u201cDistribution of Western Thatching Ants (Formica Obscuripes) and Their Effects on Soil Condition in a Coastal Dune Ecosystem\u201d  \nFaculty Advisor: Erik Jules, Biological Sciences\n\nChant\u2019e Catt, Sonya Woody, Ashley Bradshaw, Katelyn Harris, graduates, Social Work  \n\u201cEducated Landlord and Tenant Programs\u201d  \nFaculty Advisor: Jen Maguire, Social Work\n\nGabriel Goff, graduate, Forestry  \n\u201cPhysiological Responses of Quercus Garryana to Conifer Encroachment and Removal in Northern California\u201d  \nFaculty Advisor: Lucy Kerhoulas, Forestry\n\nAndrew Hahn, graduate, Kinesiology  \n\u201cThe Effect of Interval Intensity on Time to Exhaustion and Metabolic Profile During HIIT Running in Recreational Runners\u201d  \nFaculty Advisor: Young Sub Kwon, Kinesiology\n\nMegan King, undergraduate, Biological Sciences  \n\u201cLoss of lgH Affects Cellular Migration and Anchorage Independent Growth and Increases Sensitivity to mTOR and MAPK Signaling of Murine Neural Progenitor-like Cells\u201d  \nFaculty Advisor: Amy Sprowles, Biological Sciences\n\nAngel Lomeli, graduate, Kinesiology  \n\u201cThe Effects of Secondary Cognitive Tasks on Performance of the 3-Meter Tandem Gait in Concussed and Non-concussed Individuals\u201d   \nFaculty Advisor: Justus Ortega, Kinesiology\n\nSpencer McLintock, graduate, Environmental Resources Engineering   \n\u201cThe Use of UV Light for the Treatment of Cyanotoxins in Small-Scale Drinking Water Treatment Systems\u201d  \nFaculty Advisor: Margarita Otero-Diaz, Environmental Resources Engineering\n\nCarissa Pritchard, graduate, Anthropology  \n\u201cAssessing Craniofacial Variation and Sexual Dimorphism in a Skeletal Sample from Medieval Prussia\u201d  \nFaculty Advisor: Marissa Ramsier, Anthropology\n\nNathan Tamayo Hernandez, graduate, Kinesiology  \n\u201cPerformance Profile for Tabata Intermittent Training on Treadmill\u201d   \nFaculty Advisor: Young Sub Kwon, Kinesiology\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ligqss5d4uv21.jpg?width=2527&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c0bf4c0a83b9ac2d0373a89dbd990ca1c16c49f7",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nHumboldt has by far my favorite campus of all of the CSUs (love 60 degree weather, redwoods, and beaches) I wanted to know how good is the biochemistry option here? \n\nI know that its treated as a sort of like 'focus' for the Chemistry major and i can come out with a BS or a BA in it, although im not 1000% clear on the distinction between the two.\n\nThe website doesn't tell me much in all honesty, the most information I found was a page that listed what tools and equipment will be available to the chemistry students. From that it looks good, but I'd assume most colleges with this major would have this stuff by default (could be wrong tho).",

            "comment": "Am a botany major, but I think HSU has a great chem department. (I\u2019ve taken general chem and organic chem.) \nHSU is one of the best CSU schools to go to if you\u2019re interested in anything related to bio. If you really want to add onto the \u201cbio\u201d emphasis, maybe look into a minor in biology. It should be super do-able since those majors have some overlap. \nI hope this helps!",

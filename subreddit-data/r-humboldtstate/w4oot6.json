I have to really watch my blood sugar so I\u2019m currently on a keto lifestyle, but I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s going to be sustainable on campus with a meal plan. \n\nAlso, are the foods in the J pre-portioned? I was hoping to just take a little bit of certain foods if they weren\u2019t too carb-y, but I can\u2019t really do that if it\u2019s already portioned lmao",

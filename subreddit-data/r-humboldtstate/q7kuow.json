The place I chose to go my last day in Humboldt County before moving away :(\n\nPatrick's Point State Park (I think it may have been renamed to Sumeg State Park since I moved). Amazing hikes, beaches, and campsites if that's your speed.",

Hike the woods behind campus (Trail 4), Sumeg State Park for wedding rock and agate beach (pick up lunch at Murphy's or the mashed potato cone place).  Eureka bay trail from Target to Old town and then get pizza at smugs and buy records at the works.   North and South jetty are pretty amazing.   Get a giant sandwich from the Coop &amp; crepes from Renata's.",

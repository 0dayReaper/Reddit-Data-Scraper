    "postText": "Hi everyone! So apparently HSU is hills and stairs university!! I have pulmonary hypertension, a heart and lung condition. It is hard for me to walk around without getting tired. This is even more so true when going up hills or stairs. For all of you students at cal poly humboldt with disabilities, how do you get around? I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll pass out or something trying to walk to class!! The exercise will be good for me eventually but I need to work my way up to being able to handle the campus. What do I do??",

I believe their office is in the library basement currently but you can call or email them and setup a regular schedule to help you get to your classes in a timely manner.",

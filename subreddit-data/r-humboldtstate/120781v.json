    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI was curious if anyone has taken CHEM 107 over the summer online with Prof. Burrell. What was your experience taking it at a faster pace than a typical fall/spring semester?\n\nI am hoping to take the class over the summer if its offered online again like previous summer semesters.\n\nThanks in advance!",

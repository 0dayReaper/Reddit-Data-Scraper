I'm really excited to go but want to know what to expect. \n\nAlso, Are there any activities/events I can go to on the night before or after to get an idea of the resident life? I've been doing community college almost all online and want to try and make friends before the fall starts.",

As for what goes on throughout the year you will totally find a better college life anywhere else other than this town. Sure there are house parties, but barely any lmfao and if they aren\u2019t rolled on than you\u2019re at the one party the whole year that actually went all night long.\nYou\u2019re incoming freshman so I bet your type of night is different than someone a lil older. So there\u2019s afters for the older crowds at the bars and peers houses. \n\nWhatever this dude below said about parties all year they are straight up lying lmfao. Unless they party at the blue house where there been like 12 sexual assault cases last month from people who don\u2019t even go to the school. \nI\u2019m actually baffled this dude said \u201cif you don\u2019t get invited just say so\u201d \nLmao \ud83e\udd23this school is the lamest crowd there is.",

So it\u2019s nice to see him doing what he likes. It\u2019s a calm atmosphere but you can make it what you want. \nPersonally I\u2019m a city guy so this place all four years was not for me. Last semester here. I made a good group of friends I just like different crowds. And they have no football here so I kinda lucked out. You got this. Have you visited before?,",

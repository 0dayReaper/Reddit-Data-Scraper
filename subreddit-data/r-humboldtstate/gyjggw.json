    "postText": "Hi! I am moving out of my house on July 1st and looking for someone to take over my spot. It's a big house surrounded by redwood trees. It has 2 living rooms, a super big backyard and a sizable kitchen. It is close to a bus stop but also only a 20min walk from HSU. Rent and deposit is $550 and tenants pay all utilities except trash. There are 2 friendly doggies that live here but the landlord would prefer no more pets. House is also a 5min walk from a trail head. DM if interested or want to see pics!!",

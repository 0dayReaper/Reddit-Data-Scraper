    "postText": "i am going to be transferring from an oc community college this fall, and i was wondering what hsu is like overall? i lived in minnesota until i was about 13, then southern california for the past 7 years- so i\u2019m familiar with being in extremely small towns with a farmer or two across the way. \n\ni just don\u2019t want to embarrass myself by being out of touch or moving too fast (because everything moves so fast over here, it was certainly a shock when i came from mn) \n\nthanks for any help!! :0)",

            "comment": "I also came from OC.  I wouldn't say it's a super small town.  There's about 45000 people in the general Humboldt bay area, and that's about half of most OC cities.  OC is not as fast paced as a place like LA, so Humboldt really isn't that much more slow in that sense.  I'd just say people are generally more laid back and nice.  On the outskirts of town you get the more rednecky parts for sure.  The barns and farms are gorgeous though.",

            "comment": "&gt;moving too fast \n\nHumboldt Time is slow. If my memory is correct, Arcata has two traffic lights. Highway 101 connects the towns of the North Coast and is nothing like the crazy highway driving in a major city.\n\nArcata is bigger than your Minnesota experience, but life is pretty slow. Most stores close by 6 p.m. Restaurants close at 9 p.m. Only coffee houses, bars and concert venues stay open late.  \n\nDon's Donut Bar used to be open 24 hours in the 1990s and had a cult following simply because it was open at night. It's not an actual bar, and is now called Don's Donuts &amp; Pizza, presumably due to a change in ownership. \n\nWinco in Eureka is another oddity... hands down the most inexpensive grocery store and it's open 24 hours (when there isn't a pandemic going on). It's not unknown for students to do a Winco run at 1 a.m. just because there's nothing else going on.\n\nArcata prides itself on being pedestrian friendly. If you live near a destination, you'll probably walk there. The speed limit through almost all of Arcata is 25 mph. The one exception is a short portion of road that leads to a hospital and the speed limit there is 35 mph.",

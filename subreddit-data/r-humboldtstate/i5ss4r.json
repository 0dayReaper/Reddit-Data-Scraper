The fall semester starts on Aug 24 and ends on Dec 18. The spring semester starts on Jan 19 and ends on May 14.\n\nNote that the calendar I linked is an administrative memo, so it has information that you don\u2019t need to worry about, like when grades are due. \n\nThis year will be a little different because of COVID-19. Virtual instruction starts on Aug 24. Face to face instruction starts on Sept 8 and end on Nov 6.",

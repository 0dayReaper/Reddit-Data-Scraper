    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m considering attending Humboldt as a freshman this upcoming fall as an oceanography major, and I have a few questions about it. What\u2019s the course load like? Are there a bunch of hard classes? How often are you in the water? Is it taught the same as marine biology or is it only oceanography? How possible would you think it would be to do a double major (oceanography and pre-physical therapy)? \nThank you so much for any input! So far the school looks great and is one of my top choices! Thanks again y\u2019all!",

Marine biology was still a part of the biology program, so it's a lot heavier on that coursework. \n\nOceanography is separate from the biology program. I would take a look at the catalog and compare required courses! A marine bio double major with pre-physical may be easier just because of the biology overlap, but again see what the catalog says",

    "postText": "Questions: Outta curiosity how is Cal Poly Humboldt for premed education? How is Humboldt county for entry-ish level healthcare workers (I'd be looking to work as a p/t emergency dept technician next summer for example). How hard is it to get involved with a biology lab and conduct individual research? Are professors generally supportive of publishing undergraduates if their work is exemplary? Are local MD's into offering regular shadowing opportunities or do you need to be a kiss ass and network to find a personal hook up? \n\nBackground: Currently I have a dope job and school situation in the bay area - I work as a BLS EMT and medical scribe in a tightly-run level III ED where making friends and professional connections comes easy for once. Knocking out my academic req's (ochem etc) at a solid local JC. I already have an undergraduate degree in studio art but going for a B.S. in bio as I want to pad out my STEM education with genetics, biochem, advanced maths, evolution, even some zoology etc. Transfer options are limited because of my second baccalaureate status (e.g. UC Davis admissions has given me the big fat NOPE flag a few times via email. Humboldt is cool w/2nd bacc's). The intersection of communicable disease and human-animal-plant interaction is a subject I find fascinating. Humboldt seems like it has adequate resources for a few more years of intellectual exploration and working experience, but it's goddamn isolated from larger universities. Just wanna make sure it will be enough, as I'd be uprooting myself and another hooman I care about (who's supportive, excited for a potential move and employable up there). I could find a way to stay here, but the chance to study biology at Humboldt for a couple years seems pretty awesome.  \n\nAny premeds or associated folk care to comment? Thanks.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL, DR Does the school (and local hospitals/clinics) offer enough resources for premeds? I have a happy thing going in the bay area and don't want to f\\*ck things up...",

While finding a medical job here in Humboldt wouldn\u2019t be a problem, it almost certainly won\u2019t provide the opportunities you\u2019re looking for. The University is a good school with some flagship programs, but pre-Med is not one of them.",

I should probably go anyway though since it is almost over.\n\nedit: nevermind, I didn't go. I spent too long getting ready because I wasn't in the mood for it anyway.",

I enjoyed taking a club we have here to the plaza. Its really nice getting everyone together to go out and be apart of the community. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf ya ever need a group to go with it doesnt matter what youre into let me know and you can always join. Have a great night :)",

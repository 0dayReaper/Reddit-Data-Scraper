And if so what/where are they in the park? \n\nObviously I won't be hiking these roads soon, but just wondering. Be safe out there everyone \ud83d\udc9b",

Call HRSP directly with questions. 707-946-2409.\n\nNote that the park is closed to vehicular access and campgrounds are closed during the pandemic.",

Or if a map shows any of them?  \n\nAnd by river bar access, do you mean any river access points river within the park are dog ok? \n\nSorry for so many questions, I just want to make sure I do my research!\n \nThank you so so much for taking the time to respond.

Any spot along the River is okay as long as you don\u2019t use a trail to get to it. An easy one to get to is the Gould river bar access, it\u2019s about 1 mile north of the Burlington campground. Further south is landsdale river bar access, that\u2019s a little past the hidden springs campground. The day use areas also areas to get to the river as well. Williams grove and garden club of America are good day use areas. Have fun!",

Thank you so much for sharing how to access, I can't wait to check them out in the future!!!! \n\nLast question!\n\n On Google maps I saw \"Grasshopper-Multi use trail\" , and looking at it from the Google maps point of view it looks like a road but I wasn't sure if it was, since it says trail? And then \"Squaw Ridge Road\" , I was wondering the same thing about (If this could possibly be dog road areas) If you don't know the answer to this no worries at all you've already helped me so much, thank you!",

The trail is right across from Burlington campground, but it\u2019s on the other side of the river, and I\u2019m not sure if they have the summer bridges out yet. The grasshopper road is off of Mattole road. The grasshopper road is right before Albee creek campground. I believe it\u2019s gravel, so it\u2019s okay for dogs. It\u2019s a pretty steep road though, it\u2019s almost all uphill.",

Just trying to get a layout in my head of access points I could go to.\n\n So is the Multi-Use Trail open to doggos, or not?\n\nAnd do you happen to know If there are other gravel roads that aren't so steep? \n\nAgain, no worries at all if you don't know this information! !

I start my seasonal job there in a few weeks, so I\u2019m not 100% sure on every rule, but based on the information that they gave me, it sounds like everything but the campgrounds and visitor center will be open to the public",

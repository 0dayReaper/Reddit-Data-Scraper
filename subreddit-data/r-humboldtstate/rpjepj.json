The wireless part is simply provided by your router, a box that connects to your cable modem. The router is rented by you from the provider, or you buy a router (a much better idea in the long run). You still need to pay for the cable modem Internet access if you buy your own router.\n\nSuddenlink is the only game in town for home Internet, unfortunately. \n\nIf you can afford $500 in setup costs, you can get on the waiting list for Starlink. However, Starlink uses a satellite dish and it may stop working if you change apartments too far from your original location (Starlink pays attention... yeah, you cannot buy used equipment for this reason).",

Your monthly bill may have a habit of seeing significant price increases over the course of a year.\n\nIf they don't budge, cancel and have a roommate sign up to get a new customer rate.\n\nThis is the main reason Starlink is attractive... because people hate Suddenlink.",

I\u2019m scared.\n\nalso, I\u2019m disabled so getting around is pretty hard. Getting up crazy stairs and stuff isn\u2019t my fort\u00e8. I was told that there is a disability shuttle that can take me to and from my classes. How reliable is that?",

Just keep openness of communication and let them know what you need/who you are. I think you will have a great time, the stairs are the worst part, which considering you are disabled, I am super sorry about the stairs.",

Your \"cohort\" is just the group of people you're going through the program with, people in the same year/type of classes you'll be taking.  Unless you hear something about an \"intensive\" in the beginning of the year, it sounds like you should be clear.  Cal-Poly Humboldt also has lots of drop-in hours for academic counselors, I used that a lot to help with questions like these.  Honestly sounds like you'll be fine to be fully online if classes say online, best to check with a staff at the school though . Best of luck!!! Big breath, this program and the workload seems much more daunting than it really is - promise :)",

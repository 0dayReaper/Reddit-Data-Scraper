I just finished up there, let me know if you need any advice on places to go or things to do. \n\nTo sum up... Have fun, be safe, go to class, go to the farmers market, pay the kind hot dog man at the farmers market, go hiking, visit Trinidad, and never be afraid to try new things. \n\nBest of luck.",

He also met people who love the same things as he does and don\u2019t judge him for being such a nature loving fanatic. He had a great first year and he\u2019s in a single in College Creek next year. Congratulations and I hope you enjoy it as much as him.",

I've definitely enjoyed my time there, despite certain decisions made by the Chancellor's Office, and they have a lot of fun activities and events year round. Best of luck to you as you start your studies, and maybe see you around campus!",

Sometimes it does take a minute to find your group and your spot here everyone is different though and take things at your own pace! Also don\u2019t aim for As aim for Cs Cs get degrees and when you aim for an A you put a higher expectation on yourself and will be harder on yourself",

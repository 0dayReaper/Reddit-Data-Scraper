            "comment": "yeah thats cool and all, but the students didnt have the courage to put their name/organization or any course of action. Like, if you have convictions, have the courage to own them. Not surprised tho, its HSU afterall. everybody has a gospel here. They just plastered hundreds of these notes all over the school with no proposal to do anything about it. Just like \"Hey look at how much money she makes that you dont!! be angry at her!!!\"",

When I made a follow-up flyer, it was rejected and then I went to the school ombudsman to have the school apply it's poster policy correctly to my flyer and get it officially approved.\n\nPost an anonymous flyer and it will be taken down without incident. Get that same flyer officially approved and the university would be in hot water for rejecting it.\n\nTo answer your next question, I had a friend on the basketball team who quit when the coach decided that the basketball team could not have goatees. So my flyers were about the idiocy of that requirement. Obviously having facial hair impairs an athlete's ability to perform to the best of his ability.",

For all the progressiveness and equality talk the students love to ramble on about, I couldn't help but see the irony in shaming an accomplished woman for making TOO MUCH money. ",

They don't give a reason to believe she earns more than other CSU presidents, so, really, she is being damned for having accepted the job.",

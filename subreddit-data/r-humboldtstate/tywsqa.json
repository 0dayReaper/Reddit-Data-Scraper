I don\u2019t mind having a gender inclusive room. I am fairly avg on being clean. I\u2019m not the most tidy nor am I the worst. Most of my \u2018mess\u2019 would be papers on my desk. \nI am very respectful of personal space. I am willing to share depending on the item. I typically am a night person. I don\u2019t mind if you drink or smoke. I enjoy being outside and physical activities. I am fairly nerdy, I like some mainstream anime. Like learning about the world around me and how it works. My noise level is usually low. I am an ambivert; I tend to be semi introverted at first then when i get comfortable i tend to be \u2018more like myself\u2019\nif anyone was interested, would love to communicate through here or insta (@hey.sues). \nTL;DR- Looking for a roommate, i like nature, calisthenics, new things, and i would say i\u2019m pretty chill in general. \nthanks for reading :&gt;",

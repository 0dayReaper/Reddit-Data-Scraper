    "postText": "Hey all! My amazing meditation teacher, Therese Scott is hosting a zoom meditation practice next Tuesday at 12pm! This is open to the wider HSU community and honestly further if you have some friends or family interested in trying it out. I've been attending zoom meditation twice a week since covid and I really can attest to how much it helps with the overwhelming and anxious times we are in. It's really fun and if you have any questions I would be happy to answer them as best as I can!\n\nThe zoom link is here:\nhttps://humboldtstate.zoom.us/j/91981449011\nThe zoom meeting ID is: 919 8144 9011\nAnd again the date/time is Tuessay, May 5th 2020 at 12pm Pacific Time",

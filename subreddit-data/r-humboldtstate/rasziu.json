    "postText": "So I am pulling hairs out of my scalp because I thought, after completing the new student Canvas orientation, that we would be emailed later with further steps towards registration for the spring semester, as the MyHumboldt/Oracle system was showing \"unassigned\" for my advisor. I am not sure how I could've possibly missed the deadline for registration and am very disappointed with myself, I am usually more organized.\n\nTHAT SAID\n\nAre my hopes of going to Humboldt over? Will I still be able to receive advising and register? I'm fully admitted and contacted my major's advisor and the orientation team as soon as I found out (today, December 6) and waiting for a reply.\n\nThank you guys for the information I hope I didn't blow it and don't have to wait a whole other semester or go to a different school.",

Advisor responded and made it sound like it wasn\u2019t a big deal at all, he\u2019ll be meeting with me on zoom on the 9th to \u201cdiscuss my schedule\u201d",

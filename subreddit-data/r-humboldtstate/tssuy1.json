My biggest values are a college where people are nice, there's good student life, a lot of people living in the dorms, good classes, and a good study abroad program!",

            "comment": "Alright I\u2019ll address as many of your points as I can. \n\nAre people nice? Yes, especially if you find your people. But there\u2019s also plenty of assholes and I\u2019ve heard a white kid say the n word at half the parties I\u2019ve gone to, and I spent my time with some very liberal people. You can expect some homophobia as well. \n\nGood student life? That\u2019s hard for me to properly assess. Considering that I transferred to HSU in fall 2019 and graduated last semester, I only really got to experience college during covid. But there are plenty of clubs and if you live on campus there are small events like movie nights. \n\nDo a lot of people live in the dorms? Yes and no. The dorms are always full, there\u2019s waitlists and I believe after you\u2019re a freshman you aren\u2019t guaranteed housing on campus, which means you\u2019d need to find a room or apt off campus. HSU is also planning on increasing enrollment, but there isn\u2019t new housing being built. Not ideal. Most students don\u2019t live in the dorms. Some of the people I met looked down on people that chose dorms, but I think that\u2019s cause we were transfers. The dorms themselves are alright- good, but I\u2019ve only been to the freshmen housing once. \n\nAre there good classes? It depends on your major. For a lot of your ges, and 100-200 level classes; I felt like my community college provided a much superior experience. Also better and more classes. For my major, other csus and ucs offered a lot more classes. I definitely wish that I had that option. I enjoyed my classes and professors tho. \n\nGood study abroad program? Again, I went during covid; but I didn\u2019t encounter a single person that studied abroad and I interacted with hundreds of students. I think most people didn\u2019t think about it before covid started either because a lot of us are/were poor. \n\nHonestly if you don\u2019t know what you plan on doing career-wise, go to a community college and transfer in 2-3 years. If you do know, and it\u2019s a good program, then come up. The biggest positives are low cost and the nature that\u2019s all around.",

I did study abroad and had a nice experience but they don\u2019t have a variety of options.\n\nIt seemed to me like less than half of the students live on campus. There\u2019s a forest by the freshman dorms so if you\u2019re into the outdoors/hiking that\u2019s a plus.",

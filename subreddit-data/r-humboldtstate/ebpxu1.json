    "postText": "So I haven't gotten many answers to my earlier question about the criminology department, so I figured I may have more luck broadening the question this time around. How is HSU for social sciences? Does the department seem underfunded or understaffed or does it get as much attention as some of the science majors?",

            "comment": "I'm in the soc/crim department. As a sociologist mind you. Soc and crim are underfunded but have phenomenal lecturers and staff minus a few. The good staff really go the extra mile for students as far as quality of content goes. Some of the newer lecturers are a bit wanting though. Their appeal is that they pander to popular narratives with very little effort put into the content. I've been unlucky enough to have a new lecturer tell me that \"they found it online\" when asked about the source of certain information. At the same time the majority of social science staff know exactly what they are talking about and are more than willing to form a discourse on the subject",

I was originally in the social sciences, but it was so \"white privelege/oppression/intersecitonality/etc.\" heavy that I dropped three classes on my second day, switched majors, and never looked back.",

One day, not to long from now, when you graduate, you will have to get a job (presumably where you want to work hard). If you get a degree in ss you won't learn any marketable skills; you'll be in a especially precarious situation if you took debt out to get it. Put effort in now to set yourself up for the rest of your life. 4 years goes fast and soon you will have to put food on the table for yourself. Don't make your future self regret your education. \nOr don't listen to me, just remember, I like my coffee black!",

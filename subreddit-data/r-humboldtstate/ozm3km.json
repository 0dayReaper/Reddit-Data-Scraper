I\u2019d say the university will issue an update in the next week?\nEdit- they are already requiring staff and students to be vaccinated, but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not news to you.",

I\u2019m getting worried really need in person classes. To get involved around campus socially. it seems ridiculous to be still locked down where everyone is vaccinated.",

There\u2019s car accidents and non covid health issues that put people on those beds as well. Only about 50% of the county is vaccinated and those that weren\u2019t, didn\u2019t do well with the \u2018honor\u2019 system of wearing a mask inside once the June 15 mask mandate ended. I\u2019m sorry it seems ridiculous to you but at this rate (100 cases on Friday) were likely looking at indoor dining closing soon etc.",

(dont forget to check yours :) )  \n'Masking:   \nHumboldt State University will go back to universal masking starting Saturday, August 7. Per Humboldt County Public Health mandate, everyone, regardless of vaccination status, will need to be masked while indoors except if you are alone in a private office with the door closed. You will also need to wear a mask outdoors anytime you cannot maintain six feet of distance from others. Athletics participants may be unmasked only during active sanctioned practice or competition.   \n   \nEvents:   \nThe University has decided to suspend all large in-person events on the main campus for the next eight weeks starting Monday, August 9. Large events are being defined as any event that brings more than 20 people together. Any gathering smaller than 20 people may continue but organizers are highly encouraged to hold them virtually if possible. Any event, regardless of size, where food or drinks are being served, must get written approval from Risk Management prior to the event. Contact risk-managment@humboldt.edu for more information.'",

            "comment": "Per a library blog post that went up August 9, the library will be open starting Monday, 8/16 (when transfer students move in) for partial library services, but not for students to use for studying. It seems like there are some other common spaces that'll be available though. Here's the actual text from [that notice](https://sites.google.com/humboldt.edu/hsulibraryblog):\n\n\"HSU Library services are temporarily located in the lower level of the Library, Room 28, due to construction. Beginning on Monday, August 16, 2021, limited library services are available. The hours for in-person service will be Monday - Friday 8am - 7pm, and Sunday 11am - 6pm. Services include:\n\nPhoto IDs: get or replace your HSU ID\n\nReserve textbook checkouts: free use of textbooks for four hours at a time, plus access to etextbooks\n\nEquipment checkouts: laptops, hotspots, cameras, and other digital media equipment; check out in Library \n\n\n\nStudy Spaces on Campus: Library computer/study spaces are closed, however the following spaces are open August 23 - December 17:  ART A 027, BSS 211, FH 178, FH 202, HGH 115, HGH 204, KA 104, NHE 113, SBS 165 Lobby, SCI A 460, SH 116, SH 118, TA 114. Computer Lab locations and hours can be viewed at the ITS Computer Labs site.\"\n\nI know having locations available as to use as workspaces is going to make a big difference for me this year, especially with double-occupancy back in action in the on-campus residences. Hope this helps!",

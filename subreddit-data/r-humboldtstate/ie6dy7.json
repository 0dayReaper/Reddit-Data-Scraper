Does anyone know if this is something standard, or related to the solicitation scandal in spring 2020, or something else entirely?\n\n(Basically I'm nosy.)",

That email is likely regarding input from other faculty and dept students about potential new lecturers/profs or for moving an existing lecturer to the tenure track. Its not unusual for a lecturer to work at HSU for a while, leave to try somewhere else for a bit and then decide they liked it best here and come back. I've seen it twice in my own dept.",

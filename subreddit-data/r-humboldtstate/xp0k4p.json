I honestly have 0 friends anywhere, the only interaction is within the confinements of class and that's it. Just trying to find some way of making friends. It is hard in part with being autistic, where it's hindering my way of socially interacting with people. The only avenue looks to be the club fair coming up, where it could be where I met people with interests like my own. I'm not asking for anything, don't even know what spurred to post this here on the school's SubReddit. I guess I was expecting the student population here more welcoming. Take care.",

Go where the interest and the hobby are and force yourself to say hi to people. Organized activities are even better because you usually get assigned a partner/opponent (competitions, tournaments, rec league, board game nights, etc.) so not socializing is not an option (maybe don't do these if you are overly competitive or can't handle losing very well, try to find something more team or group oriented with a mutual goal instead of an adversary, beach cleanups, volunteering, working at a haunted house, etc.). Social anxiety is one hell of a limiting factor in a lot of our lives (mine included) but every time you conquer that fear long enough to say hi or exchange simple pleasantries with someone the easier it makes it next time you want to approach them. First time saying hi and talking about the weather to someone they are a stranger (don't even usually exchange names until the second or third time meeting), the 5th time they are an acquaintance, the 15th time you are basically friends, ask them to grab a drink some time.",

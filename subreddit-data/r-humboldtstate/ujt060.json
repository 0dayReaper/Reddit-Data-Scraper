This means that I would have to stay at his couch for a bit.\nI want to follow a late stay request: I know they usually only approve it for 24 hours and for seniors, but could they potentially approve for a junior? Does anyone have experience filing a late stay request?\nThanks y\u2019all",

Attend the ceremony in the morning, went to a celebration lunch, and then came back to get my boxes out by 5.  \n\nI don't think they'll give you a few days unfortunately but a week on the couch isn't so bad. It's worth a shot to ask but back when I was a student they were pretty firm on getting people out.",

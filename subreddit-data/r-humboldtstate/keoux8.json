Originally they were going to create off-campus housing, but they got backlash from the community. Now it\u2019s up in the air as far as what they\u2019ll do with the property. \n\nI would reach out to HSU\u2019s [off campus housing coordinator](https://housing.humboldt.edu/resident-resources/off-campus).",

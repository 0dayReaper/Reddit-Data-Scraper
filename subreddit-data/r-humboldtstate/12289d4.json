    "postText": "Hi guys, I've applied and been accepted to Humboldt, and I'm trying to pick between it and Monterey. I really love everything about Humboldt (classes sound super interesting, campus is beautiful, lots of cool clubs), except I have no interest in weed or anything else and I've heard it's really very ingrained in the school's culture. I also don't like being around while people are getting high. I seriously have no moral issues with it at all and most of my friends do smoke, it's just weird personal discomfort about being present for it, and it's not extreme, like, I won't panic or anything, but it does bother me. I'm really genuinely sorry if this sounds judgemental. I just worry that I wouldn't be able to connect with the community/make friends. \n\nSo, please be honest with me, is this really not the place for me or is it overblown and not that big a deal?",

Though many say it was poorly implemented as the small growers all got stiffed, it has for sure pulled the plug on turning a rental house into a grow operation, or of anybody's dreams of turning their closet grow into a legit cannabis operation and retiring young. So there's a bit of an economic downturn happening, even besides the damage to small businesses from the pandemic shutdowns, in that lots of them (restaurants especially) depended on lots of locals with disposable cash to burn).   \n\n\nIf you look for it you can find it, but I've lived in the area for a couple decades now and work at the university (not a professor) and I know that there's plenty of sober options available as well and not hard to find. Most students are here to succeed and not to party. Partying can still happen, but some majors require quite a few dry nights than others, so be careful who you make friends with and you'll do just fine.",

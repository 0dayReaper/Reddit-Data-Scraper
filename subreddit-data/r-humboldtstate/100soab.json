That guess is based on the following message on the [Financial Aid website](https://finaid.humboldt.edu/staff):\n\n&gt;Financial Aid Staff Availability:\n\n&gt;WINTER BREAK CLOSURE- The Financial Aid office will be closed December 23, 2022-January 3, 2023",

Following up within a reeasonably time,. say a week or two is a great prompt to \"see where they're at\".\n\nIf you have questions within your department, I would recommend starting by emailing the department head chair, followed by the professor of the course you intend to take to begin a dialogue to carry you through your time at the university,  \n\nI missed the \"registration deadline\" by a single day over memorial-day weekend in 2017, subsequentially disabling my ability to register for classes unitl mid-august.  At that point there were only upper division courses with open registration and had to hit the ground running.  It was difficult but I found everyone fairly understanding.\n\n\\--",

            "comment": "From what I\u2019ve heard, the Botany program here is really well done. I have taken two classes and both teachers were engaging and super passionate. The cannabis studies program is a B.A. (not a B.S. like Botany) and focus much more on the connection to community and learning about how people use cannabis vs. the science behind it. Its also a brand new major, starting up within the last year, so there isn\u2019t too much to go off of with creating expectations for that major.\n\nIf I we\u2019re interested in those two programs I\u2019d major in Botany and either see if there\u2019s a minor or just take a few classes from cannabis studies.",

Legal policy will focus on  Advocacy and Lobbying, the history of cannabis policy, legalization, and licensing neither concentration focuses on the cultivation harvesting or extracting of cannabis (unfortunately)",

            "comment": "I'm super impressed with the responses below except for the part where someone said it's about business. A few things to add: yes, there will be a minor coming online the following year; that said, the business of cannabis is hyper-regulated so the policy concentration would serve anyone well who wants to go into the business side of things; the enviro stewardship concentration is a BA but probably should be a BS (they wouldn't let us make a program with both BS and BA options); we are working on getting the administration to get the two new hires that were in the proposal but for now I'm the only full-time faculty for it; as public university administrative guardrails come off we definitely want to incorporate plant-touching and more directly business-relevant training as well as hands-on plant-touching and molecule-analyzing elements; we are working with one of the new DEA-licensed researchers to chemically analyze product (since hers is federally legal); and generally speaking there's plenty of opportunities in Humboldt County to learn about the industry by working in it. This is a great place to learn about cannabis and society because for all its issues, Humboldt County is the place where stigma against the cannabis is relatively scarce which allows us to focus on the complexity of policy change and its effects without having to debate whether the plant or people who make a living with it or just consume it are morally bad.

            "comment": "I am in the cannabis studies class now, and I really dig the Doctor who is teaching it. We are kinda in the mindset of studying the beginning of Cannabis' influence on the human culture. It is super interesting as we are discovering how it was a catalyst for human growth. Not just in a smoking sense but as a Food, Fiber, and Fuel sense. It was crazy how much it has grown with us. \n\nHe mentioned how there are 180 applicants for next years program, but as of now we are doing this one special topics class that was hidden in the class list. So its probably why there are only 7 of us in the class. It is really cool though.",

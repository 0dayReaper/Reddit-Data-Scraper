Command hooks are great for heavier items but they do tend to take off a small layer of paint. \n\nIf you\u2019re in some of the older dorms you\u2019ll notice your wall already covered in pin marks from previous students and many of my friends pinned stuff to the walls as well and never got in trouble or fined for it.",

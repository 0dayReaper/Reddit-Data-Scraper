    "postText": "I feel like I would have appreciated getting some insider tips and tricks when I first came to HSU. So, here's a commuter's tips and tricks. I can't speak for dorm living, so dorm peeps can you add your tips and tricks in the comments below? \n\n**Commuting** \nParking is limited even with a parking pass that costs $315.00 per academic year at HSU. However, if you want to make sure you get a spot in the morning come no later than 8:30am. I would say get to HSU around 7:30am to be safe, especially early on in the semester. If you have a gap between classes, going home and trying to get a spot when you come back really isn't an option either unless you're coming back for evening classes at 5pm or later. Parking also fills up quicker on rainy days because people don't want to bike to campus on those days. You can buy a daily parking pass through a machine posted in whichever general parking spot, or if you want a semester or academic year pass you can purchase those with your student ID and license plate number ready at the cashier's office on the second floor of the SBS building. For more parking information go [here](http://www2.humboldt.edu/parking/parking-fees). \n\nIf you want to take the bus for free (or, apart of your student fees really) you can use your student ID as a JackPass on the RedwoodTransitSystem(RTS). To find out more about this go [here](http://www2.humboldt.edu/parking/bus-riding). \n\n**Get Involved**\nThe best way of coming into a new community where you don't know many people is to go to events, join clubs and hang out on the UC Quad here at HSU. This is the best way to get over being homesick and make friends so you can make Humboldt your second home. To see when events are go [here](http://www2.humboldt.edu/events/), to get tickets go [here](https://centerarts.humboldt.edu/Online/) and to learn more about clubs go [here](http://www2.humboldt.edu/clubs/). The UC Quad is the open area below the clocktower and bookstore. A lot of students come to hang out here in-between classes, and at lunch time there's usually live music or something going on. \n\n**Weather**\nA lot of people say you need rain gear, but I've been here for a couple of years now and usually just closed toed shoes and an umbrella or hoodie will suffice. It doesn't really rain hard here all that often. It mostly just drizzles. I've found that the Weather Channel app is pretty accurate of when the rain is going to start. You can get notifications of when rain is supposed to start falling through the app too. \n\nDressing in layers helps a lot here though. I usually have a light to mid-weight jacket I wear/keep on me so I'm warm in the mornings and can shed it in the afternoons, or when I'm hiking up hills. If you enjoy taking walks and want to explore Humboldt County's awesome landscape though I recommend a good set of running/hiking shoes that have a good grip on them so you can enjoy walking around a lot without worrying about slipping on hills in the forest, etc. \n\n**Keep on it**\nAs long as you keep showing up to your classes and at least halfway pay attention you should do okay. It's when you start skipping classes that it becomes tempting to keep skipping, and eventually drop out. \n\nAlso, keep up with the syllabus. This is the easiest way to know what's going on, on a given day in class, when tests are happening and when things are due. This way you don't have to rely on others around you to know what's going on. \n\nThis is college so a bit of partying is totally cool but doing it every weekend probably isn't going to work out for you in the long run. Also, if you smoke weed, do it when you're done doing homework for the night. \n\n**Employment**\n[Springboard](https://www.myinterfase.com/hsu/Account/LogOn) is a fantastic place to look for jobs at HSU and in the community. HSU students jobs are very flexible with working around your class schedule and tend to be more understanding with that than out in the community. If you have problems registering with Springboard if you're new to HSU call the [Academic and Career Advising Center](http://www2.humboldt.edu/acac/) at 707.826.3341 and let them know you're a new student who's trying to register on Springboard. ACAC is also a great resource for finding employment in the local area/on campus and they offer career counseling so you can figure out what you want to do with your degree and how to make it work for you.\n\nWhen you apply to places make sure you look presentable. SO many students apply/interview in jeans and t-shirt and then wonder why they didn't get the job. I'd recommend wearing at least a nice polo shirt or blouse and khaki or black pants or a dress to even just fill out an application. This shows you're serious about getting the job. Also, a cover letter along with a resume is a nice plus. [This](https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-answer-the-31-most-common-interview-questions) website has always helped me prepare for interview questions too. \n\nHave anything to add or any questions? I think that's the main things I wanted to get out there to all you new freshmen and transfer students. If there's something you think I left out, or if you have any corrections feel free to comment below! Good luck to all of you on Monday! \n\nEdit: Words",

And when there aren't students attending classes, parking is abundant.\n\nThen one time, in the gap between spring and summer session, I got a parking ticket. I filed a complaint about it, and included a copy of the policy indicating I was correct. They waived the parking ticket, then changed the policy to allow year-round parking tickets.",

It didn't hurt that two presidents ago, the guy in charge served for like 27 years. For the longest time, they had land set aside to build a multi-story parking garage. They were just waiting for funding. Then a new president came on board and, wham, bam, they used that land to build College Creek Apartments.\n\nSo, they solved the broken parking situation by bringing more students on campus. This might make sense if those students were ones that otherwise would have been living off campus, maybe, if you also required they not bring a car (e.g., refuse to issue them a parking permit).\n\nHowever, HSU's enrollment has increased by more than 1,000 students in the past 15 or so years, and I believe they're still aiming to increase enrollment due to the state's population growth projections. So, new dorms are being built because additional students are attending.",

The dorms surrounding The J, for example, were a planned community all being serviced by The J.  Sure they're in a canyon, but they built elevated walkways, etc.\n\nThen they built Creekview at the top of the hill, with the meal plan optional, and the students disconnected from the social/recreational programs (the \"community\") surrounding The J. Want to visit The J? Yeah, you walk all the way down the hill, and have that long walk back up again. They could/should have built an elevated walkway for a portion of that trek. There is parking up there, but only enough for something like half the residents.\n\nThis detachment expanded as they created more dorms, billing the new dorms as being for upperclassmen, as a sort of excuse for why they don't get everything dorms near The J get.\n\nThere used to be only one market, in The J, and only one restaurant area (The Depot).\n\nWhen all attention was focused on The J and The Depot area, more services were possible. For example, The Depot made its own pizza (really good) and you could have it delivered to your dorm until 9 p.m. any day. The Depot was more of a semi-fast food restaurant. There was a separate cafeteria next door (in addition to the one in The J), and a candy shop accessed from the outside walkway.\n\nAll of that was feasible because there wasn't a market across from SBS, etc. The university center really was the center. HSU seems to be slowly decentralizing itself.\n\nNow the university is just buying or building dorms where they can. You may have noticed many campus buildings look like houses, and are labeled houses (House 20, House 55, etc.). That's because they were residential homes, acquired as the university built out. The Campus Apartments themselves were privately owned for the longest time, and HSU students would get parking tickets when parking in their parking lot (which adjoined the official HSU lot).",

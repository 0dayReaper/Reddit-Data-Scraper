    "postText": "Hello! I will be at HSU in the fall as a freshman. When I applied, I clicked some box to have Environmental Science as my major. Don't get me wrong, I am enthralled with the natural world and I believe that it is very possible for humans to live entirely sustainably, but I do not know if my choice to enter into that major will limit my options in the future. Should I stick with the major for now or try to go in undeclared? I am new to this \"college\" thing, any help is much appreciated. Much thanks &lt;3",

I would suggest focusing on GE classes and taking a couple degree specific classes, especially if they would also fulfill GE, so you can make sure you actually like your major. You can talk about your options if you finish with this degree with professors that specifically teach this major, like career paths and/or grad school programs. As long as your primary focus is GE you have about two years to decide without it effecting your graduation date.",

            "comment": "If you think you are heading towards a major who has requirements in common with the ESM major, taking these common classes before any non-common ones is an idea.\n\nIve changed majors ?3? times at HSU. Each change was very easy for me to do. I have heard other people say similar things about their major changed, so that's something I probably wouldn't worry about. Be mindful that changing to a few specific majors at HSU is difficult however. I believe switching to Wildlife and ?Music? is something easier said than done. \n\nAnother usefull idea is if you believe you headed towards a switch to a major that doesn't have classes in common with the ESM major, taking the classes for this new major even while enrolled as  an ESM major is likely what you want to do. Or atleast taking classes for both to get a feel etc. is an idea.\n\nGood luck.",

They are currently prospecting new computer science department professors, which if you're in the major should receive emails to view their upcoming presentations next week. None of this has a guarantee of improving the program or any radical shifts to the current computer science program. It does seem more likely then not, I believe current goal is to have two of the new programs being offered next school year which likely means more class options in the future as well.",

Either they have something to say, or not. If they ask what you mean, ask whether there are plans to expand the department or close the program. That might generate a response.",

You are presumably an adult by the time you are living in the residence halls and nobody on campus acts as a surrogate parent. (That said, you can talk to your Living Group Advisor for advice. Your LGA is a fellow student.)\n\nThe closest thing to curfew is found on page 38...\n\n&gt;**Quiet Hours**\n\n&gt;The Housing department is committed to providing an environment within the residence halls that is conducive to academic achievement. The right to study, sleep and enjoy a peaceful living environment supersedes the privilege to create noise that is disturbing to others.\n\n&gt;* Quiet hours will be in effect from 10pm to 9am Sunday through Thursday and 12am to 10am on Friday and Saturday, regardless of any campus closure days. During quiet hours, noise from any student room that emanates to any public area and noise in public areas emanating into student rooms, is prohibited. Public areas include the Hill quad, Cypress walkways, Canyon fire lane, Creekview parking lot, College Creek courtyards, Campus Apartments Gazebo, etc.\n\n&gt;* Quiet hours in Academic Intensive theme housing communities are in effect from 10pm to 10am every day, including weekends.\n\n&gt;* Courtesy Hours apply during times when quiet hours are not in effect. During courtesy hours, any resident has the right to politely request another resident to lower the level of noise.\n\n&gt;* Each semester, 24-hour quiet hours will be in effect from 5pm on the last day of classes before finals through the last day of finals. Violations of this policy will likely lead to your immediate removal. Residents are reminded that final exam periods usually create an increased level of stress for everyone.\n\n&gt;* Speakers should not, at any time, be positioned so that music is directed out of windows, doorways, or balconies. Violators may have speakers/devices removed.\n\n&gt;* Residents are expected to ask others to reduce bothersome noise levels before seeking the assistance of staff.",

Maybe it was a basic safety check that everything is okay in each residence hall. It is definitely not a curfew. Maybe pandemic related?\n\nI saw my resident director from time to time, but did not conceive of it as a scheduled walk through nor was I bothered by it. If anything, it was reassuring they were paying some attention in order to head off problems between students. Not everyone adjusts well to living in close quarters with a bunch of new people.\n\nI remember more than once when there was a conflict between two students it being a problem if the Living Group Advisor wasn't around. We don't want em during good times and are pissed they aren't here during bad times.",

I lived on the first floor and she lived on the third floor so I only saw her during building/floor meetings. As long as you\u2019re not bothering your neighbors the RA won\u2019t visit you other than a room check once a semester (no checking drawers, mostly just checking for cleanliness).\n\nAs a freshman I felt like canyon was an awesome first step. Less chaotic than the hill and felt less industrial as well. When i wanted study time it was usually quiet enough to do homework in my room. Although, if you\u2019re in a STEM major most of your classmates will be in the hill so you would probably be spending time over there anyways.",

Back in my day, there was always one or two idiot students who would let homeless people into a residence hall -- people the students knew absolutely nothing about. While it's an act that comes from the heart, it's also extremely naive and reckless.",

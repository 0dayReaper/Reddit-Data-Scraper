The closest you would get to a party dorm is if the advisor assigned to monitor and assist in your residence hall arbitrarily decided to not enforce the rules. There's no reason for one to do that though, and put their housing at risk, as well as disciplinary action. You could trust that at least one student in the residence hall would complain. Do student break the rules? Sure, it happens, but not on a scale that would deem a particular residence hall a 'party dorm'.",

There were so many issues with RA's and small get togethers got shut down so quick it was really annoying. If you wanna party, then I highly recommend not living on campus longer than you have to.",

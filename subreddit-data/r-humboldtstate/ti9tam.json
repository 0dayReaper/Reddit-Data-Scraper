For one, it just got changed to a Cal Poly school, so you'll carry that prestige as well as the benefit of a ton of upcoming improvements to the campus and program offerings. You're on the front end, so it won't be like going to Cal Poly SLO or something, but it is definitely on its way there and is already an amazing school. University experience and the education you get is a direct result of what you put into it. What really matters (if you're a good student and will excel at any of these places) is the environment and culture. There is a huge climbing and disc golf culture up here, and the environment is absolutely amazing. Nothing in California compares, if you enjoy being in nature. Where are you from? I came from Long Beach/OC so I was itching to get out of the oppressive overpopulation of SoCal. I got what I was looking for coming here, and I got an amazing education because I was happy and applied myself like never before. There will be more engineering programs being offered in coming years too, so you may be able to graduate with something other than ERE if you're interested in staying with engineering. What are your plans? What drew you to HSU? Merced, Riverside, and SDSU are all great schools too, that differ in their cultural and community offerings. What are you looking for from your education?",

You get a lot of hands-on project-based learning which is very useful for finding employment after you graduate. They work a lot with local engineering firms, so you also get to interact with professionals in the field.",

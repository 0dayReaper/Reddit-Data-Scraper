            "comment": "I lived off-campus, so no first hand experience, but I heard great things about the thematic learning communities, especially if you're not from the area.  You'll get the kind of local exposure with the extra activities that you'll have an easier time in your taxonomy and field classes, and a sense of camaraderie.  I know the Klamath Connection was a huge boost for a lot of forestry students, esp in the killer classes (gen chem, dendrology, calculus).\n\nBut then, YMMV.  If you're not into having people around all the time and need more alone-ness, a traditional dorm arrangement might be better for you.",

As for the dorms i was in sunset. It was pretty chill having all your friends close by. The annoying parts were hearing everything all the time if people were talking in the quad you'd be able to hear it or if people's are doing stuff in the next dorm over you would hear a lot more then you would want to lol. Over all its cool if youre open very outgoing even if you are not its still fun.",

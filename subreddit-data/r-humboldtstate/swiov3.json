    "postText": "Hello friends. For the BS degree in \u201dWildlife, Wildlife Management and Conservation\u201d, is it easy to get the classes you need? Or is this one of those impacted majors? I have a friend who went to another Cal Poly who needed 6 years to graduate due to not being able to enroll in the required classes (but this was engineering). Hoping to avoid this issue. Thank you!",

Is there any advantage to living on campus versus living off campus? I ask this question in case there is a benefit to being on campus in order to be near professors, TAs, study groups, wildlife facilities, etc. Thanks again!",

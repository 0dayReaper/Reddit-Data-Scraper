All the classes for it are taught virtually (I\u2019m talkin 2hr zooms with cameras on and less than 5 students present) because the only Professor teaching it moved to Minnesota at the start of the pandemic\u2026. \nThat\u2019s my experience anyways. Don\u2019t know about the quality of other concentrations. Given the Cal Poly change the school is heavily focused on funding STEM majors and less so social sciences.",

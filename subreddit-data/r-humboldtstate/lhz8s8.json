    "postText": "Please ease off. Please.  We are all stuck watching lectures/labs for 15-20 hours per week on zooms/screencasts.  With homework and studying I am clocking close to 55 hours a week on my computer, and this has become problematic. How am I supposed to work and function when I am glued to a screen all day. If you want to recycle lectures from years ago, expect recycled answers from students. It feels like you all still forget we have other classes, work, family and social needs.  If you want to dominate our evenings and weekends with busiwork, you better be responsive to email questions the whole weekend.\n\nThis isn't healthy. This isn't fun. This isn't learning. \n\nSome of you are doing a good job trying to accommodate the changes to online, while others have seriously lagged behind and caused a complete disinterest in course material. \n\n\n\nPlease, for the love of whatever you consider holy, help us through this and try to see this from our eyes. We are learning this and doing this as poor young adults, while you are making money and have vastly more experience and mental fortitude (well, probably. Some of you, maybe not).\n\n\n-end rant-",

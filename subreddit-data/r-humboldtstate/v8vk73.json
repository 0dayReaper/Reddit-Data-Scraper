    "postText": "Hey guys :-)\n\nCurious, about why you chose this university. Considering accepting admissions. Hoping to get feedback from psychology students about what the BA program was like, what a lot of study material is focused on and whatever else comes to mind.\n\nI heard humboldt county is pretty crime infested so that is one concern. What\u2019s your experience with this? \n\nThanks so much,\nChris",

            "comment": "I chose it because I was entranced by the natural beauty of the area. I went there as a single (white) woman at 30 and I never felt unsafe. I traveled around on my own plenty, but there were some limits (for example, I'd never walk around downtown arcata certainly not eureka by myself at night). But I drove, hiked, walked to plenty of \"isolated\" areas (e.g. all the way out Mattole road and Petrolia, small hiking areas in Ferndale, the more isolated areas of the state and national redwood parks). I never experienced anything negative, though there were some sketchy people occasionally but mostly in higher populated areas.  \nI had an amazing experience overall. BS in environmental science. Incredible 2 years spent in the redwoods and on the beaches. The entire area remains one of my favorite places in California because of its abundant natural beauty. The students are friendly. Most locals are friendly. Yes there is crime and drug issues but if you are aware of your surroundings and smart you don't have much to worry about.  \nEdited to add- also tuition was fairly cheap and I heard so many good things about the environmental science program.",

Getting my BA in psych was a great experience, the department has some really awesome professors. I\u2019m a pretty introverted person so I didn\u2019t make as much friends as I would\u2019ve liked, but students were friendly and I could\u2019ve made more friends if I just put myself out there.\n\nI liked HSU so much that I returned for my MA and that was also a great experience. I made some good friends in grad school. I highly recommend the school. \n\nArcata is really nice for the most part so I would recommend living there. Eureka (where I live) is pretty crime infested with the house less population, but I\u2019ve never had any major issues. It\u2019s been tolerable lol but I definitely want to move to Arcata someday, the atmosphere there is better.",

Is this psych department heavily stats focused and what is their research focus exactly because I\u2019m uncertain about not fitting in politically. \n\nThanks for your response I really appreciate it :-)",

I wanted to prepare to become a therapist so I wasn\u2019t as heavy on research and I already did my stats class in community college. I only had to take one research methods class and the rest was pretty broad depending on what interested me. \n\nSome of the more research based classes I took were things like cognitive psych, behavioral neuro (which I loved), and evolutionary psych. \n\nSome other classes I took were interviewing and counseling techniques, personality theory, psych of prejudice, etc. There\u2019s a lot to choose from, I would recommend looking their course catalog.",

I lived in the bad part of Eureka and it does not compare to the city I grew up in. Never saw anything bad go down. \n\nI also studied psychology and I loved the department. Everyone was really nice and really eager to teach you the information, but you really should know not to be fully reliant on them. If you have questions, make sure you tried to answer it yourself before you went to them to show your effort and you\u2019ll really shine in the department. The only thing I had an issue with is research opportunities, so if you\u2019re thinking the PhD route be ready to try really hard. \n\nThe scenery is like no other. Seriously, do not take it for granted. I moved to the bay area and though I love the opportunities here, nothing compares to being so close to forest and the beaches. This is what made me fall in love with the place.",

Although the environment and nature can seem interesting people suck there. It doesn't feel like California. It's very close to Oregon which was one of the last states to remove the sundown rule which is a racial restriction. This rule didn't stop until the 1960. Just like there is generational trauma there is generational hate as you will learn in Psych. Don't go here. Put your education, time, and effort in a different school.",

When I decided to go back to school I decided to come up here because of that feeling I associated with this place. As much as I love it, Humboldt is not for everyone. Even though it's grown a lot in the last 4-5 years, it's still an incredibly small community and doesn't have a lot going on. It's perfect for those who can both be social and asocial, for those who can enjoy a night out every now and again as well as enjoy a lot of time to themselves. I highly recommend it here but I also highly recommend making sure you're very certain that this is the kind of place you want to spend your early 20s.",

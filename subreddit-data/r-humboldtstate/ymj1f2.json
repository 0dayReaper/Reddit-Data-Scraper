    "postText": "I just moved out to humboldt county / arcata and have been looking for some like minded musicians to meet up to jam with, and potentially play a few house shows. I go to Cal Poly Humboldt and have been playing bass for going on 4 years. I dabble with guitar and drums but bass is home.\n\nI listen to Sleep, Om, Electric Wizard, and Black Midi\n\nSome songs I like to give an idea of what I like:\n\nAcross the river\nhttps://youtu.be/A9iR2N4FKW4\n\nFunetopolis by Electric Wizard \nhttps://youtu.be/EU0TUR-o6gE\n\nMarijuanaut's Theme by Sleep\nhttps://youtu.be/FBzZC7qSBU4\n\nbmbmbm by black midi\nhttps://youtu.be/E8BI3Bbpgdk",

    "postText": "In a historic debate Thursday night, UAW presidential candidate and rank-and-file worker Will Lehman made a powerful case for his campaign to abolish the United Auto Workers bureaucracy and establish rank-and-file power on the shop floor. \n\nThe debate was moderated by former New York Times reporter Steven Greenhouse and organized by the court-appointed monitor overseeing the operations of the UAW following the massive corruption scandal. It included, in addition to Lehman, UAW President Ray Curry, longtime UAW bureaucrat Shawn Fain, Local 163 Shop Chairman Mark Gibson and Brian Keller. \n\nWatch the entire [debate](https://youtu.be/2TAY1d9nihY) or [excerpts](https://twitter.com/WillforUAWpres/status/1573150053862199299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1573150053862199299%7Ctwgr%5Ead54cb5f08bd90e6fcc11521860668341e4cff8f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsws.org%2Fen%2Farticles%2F2022%2F09%2F23%2Fdeba-s23.html)",

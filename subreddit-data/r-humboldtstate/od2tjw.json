I\u2019m scared they\u2019ll end up having some stuff be face to face and I won\u2019t have a place to live up there if they do. I wonder if they will end up doing face to face for the spring.",

If they only say \"online instruction\" then being online wont change. if they do switch to in person it should say what building you're in (the letters) and what room (the numbers)",

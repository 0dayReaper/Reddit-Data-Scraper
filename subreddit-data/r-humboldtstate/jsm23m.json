    "postText": "Does anyone know if mad river rapids RV park is available as a long term stay for a student? I wouldn\u2019t be up there until fall 2022. I\u2019m considering a grad program. I honestly never thought I\u2019d go to grad school. I\u2019m kinda surprised/ excited that it appears that it\u2019s a reasonable opportunity. However, I now have cats because my college housing allows up to two pets. idk how to find an apartment with a cat allowed. I was living in the area before i transferred to CSU and I know that a place with pets is hard to come across. I\u2019m hoping to fully ditch my car by the time I make it back up there because my car is dying so being in arcata is important to me. I consider the area reasonably livable without a car. If any of you know of a place that I can keep my eye out that at least allows a cat or if you know about the RV park let me know. Also, can anyone tell me about grad programs in general? If I come from a different CSU to a humboldt grad program is that common? Is it like a regular 12-15 amount of units per semester? Can I work part time or is the workload super heavy? Are there a good amount of on campus jobs? Why does my partner think that I will get paid to go to school as a grad student? He heard this from someone else who graduated with a masters in a different program from HSU.",

There are employers out there with a flexible enough work schedule who are used to students.  Another option is if you can/are willing to make one or two days a week open is to get your substitute teaching credential and pick up subbing work on those days with various local districts/schools you can reach by mass transit (Eureka City Schools, Arcata Schools, Pacific Union, Fortuna Elementary, Fortuna High, Northern Humboldt Union in McK/Arcata, and the private things like North Coast Prep).  It's not a steady income, but a nice boost at times.\n\nAs far as funding, look at scholarships and you can indeed get more or less paid to go to school, or at least your financial burden eased.",

            "comment": "I would recommend Woodridge Apartments. People are always coming and going out of there so finding an opening shouldn\u2019t be too hard. They also allow pets there. And it\u2019s insanely close to the school. Like a 5 minute walk and then maybe a 10 minute walk to the town square. The RV park isn\u2019t a terrible idea, but it is a LOT farther than you think it is. And it\u2019s also quite a ways from the stores. Arcata is a very walkable town, but that particular area is a bit out of the way. If you have a car, it\u2019s not an issue, but if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s a lot of walking.",

My hopes are that ditching my current car will allow me to save the money to eventually get a new car. I really just do *not* have the funds to throw at a decent used car right now or for the next few years. The bus is sounding wonderfully fine for a couple years while I work on a degree. Also, idk if it\u2019s just me but I was browsing used cars everywhere and the private seller used car market feels like an absolute mess right now.",

            "comment": "It seems most people answered your cats and housing question and I'm new to area so can't help there. But I just moved up here for a grad program too. I'm not sure what you mean about coming from a different CSU to HSU for a grad program. Do you mean going from undergrad in one place to grad in HSU bc if so, then yes that is exceedingly common. I think its more rare for undergrads from HSU to continue on and get a Master's at HSU. \n\nFor units per semester, I don't know what program you're in but my friend is a sociology major and they said 9 units is full time for a grad student and I heard from a few others that 9 is full time for grad students. Bear in mind some of your units will be a 1-3 unit Thesis class. Right now I'm taking 3 classes and a seminar and I'm super overwhelmed. Almost everyone I've talked to has said it's more common for graduate students to take 1 or 2 classes per semester. What you need to take to graduate will vary with your program. Just talk to your advisor or a counselor to help you plan out what classes you'll take each semester so you won't be overwhelmed at any one semester but still be able to graduate on time. \n\nMy other friend is in the same grad program as I am and she works part time retail in Arcata. I would have loved to pick up a part time job but I gave myself an impossibly heavy workload this semester. So whether or not you can swing a part time job will depend on your program and how many classes you're taking. There are grader positions and class tutor positions available every semester.\n\nSome students are \"paid\" to be graduate students in the sense that they receive a small stipend. This varies by program and by PI. My PI applied for a grant to give his students a small stipend and he got it so myself and another student are receiving a stipend in exchange for some extracurricular work we have to put in. We also receive a tuition waiver. It really depends on the funding your PI is working with. My roommate's first semester they came in without a stipend OR a tuition waiver. It took about a year before they finally got the tuition waiver set. I don't know why it took so long for them, I think their PI just didn't have the funding ready at the time. Depending on your program, you can always apply for grants before/after being accepted into the program. This would really improve your chances of getting into grad school because often times a limiting factor for PIs when accepting students is that they don't have the money to fund a new student. The other limiting factor is just that they have too many students.",

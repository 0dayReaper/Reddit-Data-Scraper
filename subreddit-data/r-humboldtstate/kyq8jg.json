    "postText": "Myself and my partner are transferring into HSU this coming Fall, myself as an upperclassman and my partner as a lower division transfer, so approximately a Sophomore. We're looking at on-campus housing primarily to aid in meeting people and avoiding the driving/parking issues that come with living off-campus. In your experience, how doable/common is it to get on-campus housing together as a couple? Will there be issues with our difference in grades/years at HSU? Some on-campus housing that I have been looking at has been seemingly upperclassmen-exclusive-- how strict is this? Any insight from current or graduated Lumberjacks appreciated!",

But most places in Arcata are within walking distance, and the bus is free. If you\u2019re out of Arcata the bus is still free and you don\u2019t have to pay for parking. \nI don\u2019t believe they allow for couples to room together, and I don\u2019t think they have  opposite genders room together (idk how you identify)",

Not only are you saving money (which you will in more ways then you\u2019d expect, even during COVID), you also have the ability to have more space for yourselves that you could never have living in the dorms.  Save yourself the headache and take the time to find a place in town.",

I later moved into a great place off campus, but you are taking a risk vs. a (pretty much) guaranteed safe and functional living space on campus.",

There\u2019s an option where you can add each other as a requested roommate after you select your housing. We still weren\u2019t paired together, but after a quick email to housing they put us in the same room. Additionally, you can try to get rooms in the same suite if living in College Creek (I don\u2019t know how it is in other campus housing). This year our rooms were moved around due to COVID, but my boyfriend ended up a floor above my room so we are still very close.",

([direct image of the floor plan](https://housing.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/canyon-suite.png))\n\nThe ground floor of a Canyon residence hall has a laundry room and common area. Each floor above is a long hallway littered with doors to individual living spaces. It's very much like you might have seen dorms look in movies.\n\nAt each end of the hallway is a door that opens to an end suite. The first room you step into is a shared space for all 4 roommates. To the left and right are doors that lead to smaller living spaces, 2 students per side room. \n\nIn your bedroom there is a bunk bed, two closets, and one desk. The main/entry room has the other desk, so, because it's a 4 person living space, there are two desks in the main room.\n\nIn my time (the 1990s), the end suites were the gathering place for friends because the entry room had decent space for people to gather and there was a sofa and large lounge chair, and invariably someone had a TV for the entry room. There really isn't room for TVs in your bedroom, unless it's small and on your desk.\n\nThe floor plan doesn't show lounge chairs or a sofa, so I'm curious if the main room is just a big empty room except for the desks, or if they are just not depicted in the floor plan. \n\n[Here is a direct image of the end suite main room](https://housing.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/styles/kalapicture_6_breakpoints_kalapicture_screen-lg_1x/public/canyon_end_suite_common_area_resized.jpg?itok=6zqt_2cN), complete with the sofas. One of the desks is in the lower right-hand corner. The doors to the two bedrooms are just not visible in the image. \n\nHere is an [end suite bedroom](https://housing.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/styles/kalapicture_6_breakpoints_kalapicture_screen-lg_1x/public/canyon_end_suite_double_room_resized.jpg?itok=Q3VTr93S). It's a difficult space to photograph well. \n\nThe furniture looks the same as I had from the 1990s. Durable. I now own a desk that came from the residence halls from the 1960s. Still perfect.\n\nOther Canyon rooms that face morning or afternoon sun get quite warm unless there is airflow. When students figure this out, they open their windows and hallway doors, but that doesn't help much. The game changer is when both end suites open their main doors and windows, creating a breeze that runs the length of the hallway.",

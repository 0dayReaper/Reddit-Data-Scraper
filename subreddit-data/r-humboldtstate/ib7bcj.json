    "postText": "Anyone else hate how horribly designed the lumberjack link online orientation is? search box overlaps with links on one page, there's a text title overlaid on a photo of text on another page. Only some of the videos have captions, others have wildly inaccurate auto generated captions. The videos are all very different volumes, I have to adjust volume between every single video. If you click play on a video with another video playing, it doesn't pause or mute one of them, it plays both at once. From the checklist, you can't right-click an experience and open it in a new tab then return to the checklist. You have to follow several links to navigate back to the checklist. Furthermore, info is presented in two columns with randomly staggered rows (which personally I don't mind, but screen-reader users would). I'm really disappointed in the quality of the website. You'd think such a liberal school would care about accessibility. Considering the cost of tuition, I expect professional and functional site design! I've had positive experiences with online learning before, but this is a huge letdown. I'm hoping the class content is much better. Online learning is the new norm, it's not time for sloppy websites. Step it up, Humboldt!",

I couldn't locate the site in question; I presume it might only be accessible to registered attendees.\n\nI wonder if any of the issues are related to the web browser you are using. The \"*search box overlaps with links on one page*\" sounds like a browser-specific issue, or even a device-specific issue (for example, the page not being optimized for mobile browsers), because the display issue presumably didn't present itself when the designer was creating the page.\n\nUsing the site in another browser, especially one updated to the latest version, might make a difference. I'm not excusing backward compatibility or browser compatibility problems in general, but just looking for a short-term solution.\n\nWhat browser and version are you using, and what type of device?",

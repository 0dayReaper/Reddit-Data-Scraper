Don't know if it differs much in other dorm buildings but it has a pretty long cord and  sometimes people wouldn't clean out the dust bag, but other than that, it worked pretty well in cleaning the floor and you could change the height at which it vacuumed.",

It was surely commercial grade and could tolerate lots of use. It didn't stink because residents rarely used it. Maintenance staff (to whom we should all be kind!) would use it on the common areas perhaps weekly. \n\nThe only smell likely to occur with those uprights is hot rubber from the drive belt -- just make sure it hasn't gotten jammed up with long hair (ha!) and you're golden.",

Also was pretty loud. \n\nOn the plus side, the cord was long enough that you could stretch it all around a room and have plenty more to spare. The overall vacuuming ability was alright, you just had to sweep everything out of the corners of the furniture/walls to get everything.",

    "postText": "I haven't been accepted, but I want to be prepared. My partner is already at school here, but living at home here in LA, but we're both planning on going up for the fall 22 semester (I'm a transfer and he's returning). We really want to live together, but I'm not sure if it's likely for us to be housed together on-campus (or if that's even an option?).. Surfing through the sub I noticed housing seems to be horrendous, so I'm not really sure what the best move is.. Any advice is appreciated, thank you",

            "comment": "There is no on-campus housing for couples. You'll have to look off campus and I highly recommend starting that search around April or May. Graduates will let go of their leases around then and they will be snatched up very quickly by incoming students - you want to be part of that wave if you can. When I moved here mid-summer years ago I ended up paying rent for a month and a half before I even got here just to secure a place.",

            "comment": "Although it's not guaranteed, it does depend on timing for applications submitted and spaces available, it is possible for a couple to room together. Usually they would be in Campus Apartments or an all gender room. All rooms, have twin beds, and furniture cannot be moved. You can always apply for Housing, and if you find something off campus, you can cancel later. As long as you cancel the 2022-2023 application by July 15, 2022, there are no penalties.  Applications open next month. If you have further questions, please email housing@humboldt.edu",

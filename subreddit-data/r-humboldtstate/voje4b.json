However, I noticed it is a few years old, so ignore any dates or deadlines in it. For example, Saturday, August 17 is referenced for an event date. However, this year August 17th falls on Wednesday, which means the PDF hasn't been updated since pre-pandemic 2019. So, take everything in it with a grain of salt.",

Buy what you need, then stuff you want. Do you need chairs, a bed, lamps, posters, etc.\n\n\nWhat do you want to do? Hike? Buy Hiking boots. Shoot? Buy a gun. Bike? Buy a bike. We can't recommend much if we don't know what your interests are.",

Just keep in mind it\u2019s VERY humid here, so even though it\u2019s \u201ccold and rainy\u201d walking around campus will make you overheat really quick. bring layers, I promise you will get so much sweatier than you think",

Plus it's just better for your health to have.  Many of the rooms I lived in at HSU and off campus had serious Mold Problems from the excess moisture.",

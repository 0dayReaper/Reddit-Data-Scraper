    "postText": "Any one here in the MSW program at CPH? I\u2019ll be attending as a junior in the fall working on my BA in psychology. My original goal was to go into the counseling psychology master\u2019s program after graduation and pursue an LMFT route. However, I started an internship this year where I\u2019ve worked with both LMFTs and LCSWs, and at this point I think I\u2019m leaning more towards the social work route than the MFT route, but I\u2019ve already finished half of my undergrad in psychology. I\u2019ve talked to different MFTs and clinical social workers and they\u2019ve all said that it\u2019s possible to go into an MSW program from a BA in psych, but I\u2019m curious how that would look at CPH and if anyone\u2019s pursued the MSW program that way. I know this is a pretty niche question lol, any info would be appreciated. I\u2019ll also talk more about it with faculty and counselors in the near future. Thanks!",

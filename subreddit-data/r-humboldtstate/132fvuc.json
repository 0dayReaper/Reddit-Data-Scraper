    "postText": "Signed up for STAT 333 for fall (linear regression models/ANOVA). I am currently an elementary stats tutor and have a very strong grasp on the base material. I used to be a college algebra tutor for a while as well, but I stopped before getting to matrices. However, I'm not sure how the class will go? I took a look at the textbook, and it immediately started referencing Python scripts, matrices, and formulas. I'm not going to lie, I'm starting to sweat a little bit haha. \n\nFor context, I am a biology major and touched Java and HTML a couple of times, but I didn't go anywhere near Python. For people who have taken this class already - how was it? Does it focus a lot on Python scripts when it comes to homework, quizzes, and tests?",

            "comment": "I wouldn\u2019t worry about python, because you\u2019re probably going to to use R and RStudio for all of your programming needs. I took this course in fall 22 and our prof (the husband of your prof, not even joking there) said that a lot of the members of the department were moving towards using R (and the package ggplot for making pretty graphs). The book uses a different programming language so that will unfortunately be useless, but the actual content is the same regardless of the programming language. \n\nWe had homework assignment throughout the semester that were basically showing our work on R. We had quizzes in the beginning but those ended about halfway through the semester. I think we only had 3 exams. We also had a group project that many decided to do on their own. It\u2019s a 4 unit course so there\u2019s a lot of work, but I never felt like it was overwhelming. \n\nBefore I took 333 I hadn\u2019t taken a stats class in close to 10 years, so the fact that you have a good grasp on the basics of stats puts you in a much better position than I was in. I ended up with an A. It\u2019s just like any other math course, you have to put in the work to understand the theory and application. \n\nHope this helps and good luck!",

This was my first stats course in about 6 years, and the even with having a weak grasp of Stats I really enjoyed the course. I was able to rebuild my foundational understanding of stats and then apply that to code in R which I enjoyed. \n\nThe course is 4 units, so the work load may seem like a lot but it's totally manageable, just be patient and be ready to sit Infront of your computer and trouble shoot code.\n\nSince taking this course I have recommended it to all of my friends (especially students in the biology department), its a great course and you can get a lot of it if you take it seriously.",

You can tell she\u2019s really smart and knows a lot but she is really not that great of a teacher. She just goes way too into detail about certain things and also gets her own examples wrong quite frequently. Maybe she\u2019s better at teaching the upper division topics but at least she is rly lenient, her tests are pretty easy, and she moves pretty slow. I feel bad because she\u2019s super nice and you can really tell she cares and wants to do well but tbh I think she is a better statistician than teacher.",

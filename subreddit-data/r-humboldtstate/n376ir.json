    "postText": "How good are the lower division studio art classes at helping beginners develop actual, useful skill in drawing, painting, etc? The only thing I'm good at is graphic design and photography lol but I also would like to take the other studio art courses and see if I can develop some skill and further my artistic ability. Like on a scale from \"they don't teach you anything\" to \"anyone at Humboldt could easily pass an art degree\", how good are the art classes? Would you say art is an easy degree at Humboldt even for those who start with little talent? And how is the grading system? Any info is much appreciated. I love graphic design and photography and want to hone my skills in other areas but I'm also interested in developing my studio skills with upper division graphic design classes that are required for the degree.",

I just had a bad experience with a ceramics class in high school where she was a harsh grader even for beginners lol so even if it's an intro class, we still have to show our skill and get graded on it thats all I'm worried about, is how the grading works. I'll probably just take graphic design and photography",

Geology is a good science degree to get, but one thing to note is you will need a masters degree to be competitive in the job market, so you need to do very good in undergrad (so you can get into grad school). \nYou should consider environmental engineering as a option as well. Masters for that really isn't necessary so you'd save time and money (and be able to work on the same things 90% of geologists work on--hydrogeology).",

Yes, if you want to be a 'professional, (in geology the title/distinction is \"Registered Geologist\"--akin to Engineer who's a PE or a nurse who's a RN, difference is you don't need to go to grad school for these), you will likely need your MS (depends on state). Many employers only consider geologists w a masters as well. I would encourage you to factor this, and the extra money and time that will take, into your decision. I'd also advise thoroughly thinking about what you want to do with your career. The decision on where you go to school and what you study will effect the rest of your life. Once you graduate and are looking for work you will either be happy you worked hard and got a useful and meaningful education, or regret you didn't work hard enough and wasted your time.",

            "comment": "The CARES Student Aid is different from the Stimulus check that independents were provided. Since most HSU students are dependents or outside the age range to receive the stimulus check this is the alternative. Humboldt State University is going to be relieving a CARES Emergency Grant which is supposed to be evenly split to all current students. After speaking to Financial Aid (who also doesn't have much information) I have learned the following:\n\nThe Chancellor's Office has created a model for each CSU to follow that will emphasize equitable practices for all students.\n\n1. Students should be receiving a minimum amount. Those in need and qualify for more aid than others may also receive more.\n2. Students graduating this semester should still be receiving the financial aid.\n3. Undocumented and Dreamer students are unfortunately not eligible. The school is looking into other funding sources for those students.\n4. It's recommended to sign up for direct deposit, because then they can get it to you faster!\n\nKeep an eye out for more updates from the Financial Aid office!",

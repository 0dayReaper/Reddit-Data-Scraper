    "postText": "A little context. I am currently in my freshman year at Mt.Sac community college and for a while, I have been interested in pursuing a career in the forestry department (specifically a managerial position). I have been told that HSU is the place to go for something like that. I would also like to note that I intend on transferring during my junior year once I have completed my GE. would transferring so late be an issue?\n\nI have done some previous research on campus life but what I could never find any information on is the personal real experience of attending students so I'm not really sure what life is like at HSU. I wonder mostly about what people love, hate, could live with or without at HSU.\n\nAny and all information will be greatly appreciated and would be super helpful. Anything from the big important must-knows to the things most people would overlook.",

Explore your department\u2019s website. \n\ncheck Assist.org or with your counselor to make sure you transfer at the right time and have all requirements met.  \n\nHumboldt is great for forestry and a beautiful place in general.",

            "comment": "Hey! If you're referring to Mount San Antonio College, I transferred to HSU from there. I transferred in my junior year. I found that the transition was very smooth doing it that way, because I already had finished my gen ed classes and was mostly taking major related courses with my cohort. I did transfer into a less competitive program (liberal studies elementary ed) so it may be different for a forestry program, but in my experience junior year was not 'too late' and was when most folks transfered. I transferred in 2015 and graduated in 2018, so things may have changed, but during my time at the schools there were a few required HSU classes that were not available at Mt. SAC that I did need to take.  \n\nAs far as the lifestyle, it is different than Mt. SAC. I would say some big differences are the fact that it's rural and that does cause unique challenges such as poor public transportation (it's better right around the school), poor access to healthcare/dentists, and other things that affect you more the older you get and the longer you stay in my experience. Humboldt time took me a while to get used to, I consider myself very laid back, but I found the things like calls back, responses to emails, and just general promptness were significantly slower than I was used to. \n\nI tried to give kind of broad examples of lifestyle, because I do not think it's a place only one type of person can enjoy. While it is well suited to folks who enjoy the outdoors, there is also theatre culture, skateparks, a comedy scene, music scene, and many other interesting things for people with a variety of interests. I find it very easy to make friends here, while it isn't the case universally, Ive noticed that people with the privilege of free time usually spend it engaging in hobbies that makes it pretty easy to meet people doing interesting things.",

For starters mtsac doesn't have a forestry program or even have it as an option for a major. And even if they did how do I know what classes I need to take? I'm also concerned about the housing situation since it's so scarce in humboldt.",

I'd search for transfer class requirements or something similar online. If the campus is open, is try to see your academic advisor. They also should have a resource that tells you equivalent course numbers from Californian community colleges to the cal state system. You could search up something along the lines of 'cal state, California community college course equivalency agreements' to find them. I personally was pretty adverse to seeing counselors in my community college days and learned how to transfer from these resources. Just be sure everything is from the right year since requirements and course agreements can change.",

This will help you calculate how many semesters you'll need to go through the program. Some courses might be taught only one semester each year, depending on need.",

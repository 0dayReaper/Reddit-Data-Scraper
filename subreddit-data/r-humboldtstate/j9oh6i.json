            "comment": "I just recently switched from a bio major to a chemistry major which is not as big of a jump as psych to Bio so I\u2019ll try to help the best I can. Depending on what year you are in when you change majors depends on how hard it will be. Changing majors is the easy part since there is a online form and that I believe needs to be approved by the chair of the department and whoever would be your new academic advisor. If you can find out who the academic advisor would be earlier on it\u2019s always a good idea to reach out to them for guidance on the process. If you google biology HSU it will give a option of a pdf which shows every class you need to take In order to get the major. You can hopefully start planning some kind of data yourself to help as a guide for when you meet with a actual advisor. Since my switch which I did in sophomore year I need to take 18 units for the rest of my time here as well as some summer classes in order to graduate on track for 4 years. Hope that helps.",

I could immediately tell that my intended program was going to be a dumpster fire of idiocy, so I switched to Economics. Fortunately I had taken lower div macro and micro, as well as managerial and financial accounting (personal interest.) You can do it, no problem, but don't wait too long! Email a prof from the Bio department asap to see about getting advice on how to set up your calendar.",

Then you can decide what path you want to be. There are a lot of GEs that might change your idea of what you want to do",

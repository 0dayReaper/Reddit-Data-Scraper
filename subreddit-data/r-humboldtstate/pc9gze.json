    "postText": "Hi everyone sorry if this is too simple of a post, but I just wanted to know a few things. Could anyone tell me when Humboldt sends out acceptance letters for the spring semester?  Additionally, what does housing(rent) look like for someone with a decent credit score, savings, but no job before getting up there? Will landlords be extra picky because I\u2019m a student? Also, anyone here going to school half time while also working full time\u2014how\u2019s that like/any tips for the area? Thank you!",

Landlords aren\u2019t super picky because they know there are a lot of students, but there has been a shortage of places to rent lately so if you get on that early you should be okay and able to find a place.",

Everywhere is hiring right now also. My main concern would be finding housing, as it is extremely competitive right now. Checking Craigslist daily will be your best bet for finding a place. Beware of scams and best of luck to you!",

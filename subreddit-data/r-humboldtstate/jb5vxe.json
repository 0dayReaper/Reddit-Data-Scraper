One meeting after another starts later and runs overtime because the respect for time has vanished. Time ignoring moderators are not the worst offender. That honor goes to the voice that rings out, \"Just one more thing,\" as everyone prepares to log off. The joy for the mute function unparalleled as those needing to leave spew out expletives.\n\nNo, this affront to basic social decency can not be allowed to continue. Harness the power that is yours and yours alone, inscribe into their permanent personnel file the transgression of time theft through the student course evaluations. Bring these burglars of the hourglass before their judges \u2013 chairs, deans, department, college, and university personnel committees. You will not be reimbursed for your stolen time. You will leave an indelible digital mark that may inspire them to change their ways and respect time.",

I understand asking questions, but between asking a question that was just answered and not knowing this, it seems like you're just trolling. \n\n\nI will answer you though, if you ever decide to go to college. Based on your answer you haven't. 12 units is considered \"full time\", its the minimum number of units you need to take to qualify for full financial aid. But you need at least 15 units to graduate on time. Many students take more units than that, work their way through college, are heavily involved in clubs, have unpaid internships, or other responsibilities outside of school. They are managing financial aid, student loans, etc. People in college are adults that have other stuff going on besides school, and COVID doubles whatever you've got going on.\n\nFurthermore, when you're in college it's a lot different than highschool or tradeschool. There is more reading (at a higher level), projects, papers, etc. You are expected to participate jn clubs. There are labs, and lab projects/exams, for science majors especially. There is this thing called a capstone project for your major. You have to take the GWPE. And you're held to higher standard than highschool/tradeschool in terms of the complexity of our projects, networking with others and personal time management. Plus you're lining up your first career job in your last year.\n\nSo it's *slightly more complicated* than sitting in on some lectures and faking your way through a report about a book you didn't read.\n\nSo best of luck to you. I hope you join us one day. But don't come playing devils advocate when you don't even know how many units you have to take per semester, or bother to read the post that already answered your question.\n\nI'd revise this for length, but... I've got assignments to go procrastinate on. And two jobs. And a family.",

So, in turn, I will gladly answer your questions \n\nI\u2019m commenting because I wanted to know what\u2019s going on in my community. You\u2019re right, I\u2019m not a student nor a faculty member, but I have friends who are both. I also live and work in the Arcata-Eureka area and as HSU is the largest institution of higher learning with the largest population of both faculty and students, what happens on campus has a tendency to influence what happens off campus in these small communities. As I said, I like being social aware of what\u2019s going on in the community, and one of the ways I accomplish that is by reading this subreddit. And like most people, I occasionally have questions about what I read. \n\nI am well aware how multitasking can be challenging in college. I double-majored at UC Irvine (Political Science and International Studies) which operated on a quarter system, not a semester system, so the unit requirements were different. Add to that a deployment overseas in the middle of my undergraduate years and then on to law school after that- all while holding down various part time jobs and serving in the military (which *really* didn\u2019t help. I had more than one professor who were outwardly hostile to me because of my military service. So I definitely empathize with dealing with unprofessional professors). I didn\u2019t have a family to worry about, granted, but I also tried to maintain a healthy social calendar as well. My career now is pretty time consuming- I clocked about 98 hours last pay period, along with all the familial and social responsibilities you mentioned. \n\nI think it\u2019s simply a matter of having a different perspective. Looking back on the last decade or so of my life, I feel confident in saying my undergraduate studies were probably the easiest part of my life. I always enjoyed getting extra info from knowledgeable faculty and instructors in the military, through undergrad and then law school, because I chose to study subjects I was passionate about. Except I had to track down and solicit that extra information when it was convenient for the instructor. I didn\u2019t have the luxury of having it recorded and able to review when it was convenient for me. \n\nThus, from my point of view, the issue described in the OP wouldn\u2019t have been a problem, it would have been beneficial to me. That\u2019s ultimately why I asked why it is a problem. Perhaps I could have worded my question better as to not offend anyone\u2019s sensibilities, but I feel the question itself remains valid. \n\nGood luck on your assignment and studies at HSU.",

I have a b.s. from hsu and my lab courses that were maybe 4 units would have two hour long lectures and a 3 hour lab per week. The definition I gave is the minimum requirement for a credit set by the csu and wasc. It sets a minimum bar so you don't get short changed by an institution offering degrees for very little work or instruction. Requiring more is giving you a better education and setting the bar higher, not to mention giving the student much more value.

If the syllabus says the course will cover certain material this week and the instructor provides a recorded lecture to cover that material then that is perfectly within the agreement. If you're being graded on material outside of the syllabus then your fine to ask your instructor to follow the syllabus and I'm sure they would be responsive. It seems like you're stuck on receiving the content through a particular mode of instruction which is just not the instructors obligation to do. They provided the material for you to study to pass the test. \nIf you feel the instructor violated a code of conduct then you should pursue it. I wouldn't though, you don't have a case. A lot of people, myself included would see this as the teacher going above and beyond to provide additional resources to students.\nSidenote: My wife and I have worked in education for  many many years. It's this type of thinking that prevents teachers from doing any extra tutoring or instruction outside of what's explicitly required by contract. If they do they could get in trouble, get their employer sued, lose their job etc. Your post is a good example of how that could happen. Imagine providing additional learning resources to your students and being sued for  violating a code of conduct for not being \"professional\".",

The units dictate a minimum number of student hours worked on the course per semester in mixed modes. Im not aware of anything that says the university can't require more hours per unit or even more lecture hours per unit aside from faculty contracts. If they did require more that would only be providing more value to students.",

If I'm doing a 3 unit STEM class (some are 4, so this is a low end estimate), that's 20 total hours dedicated per week to a single class. If I'm taking 4 classes, that's 80 hours a week. Just for school, not counting work. It breaks the agreement to add an additional 4 hours because the instructor needed to double one of their lectures because they couldn't be arsed to parse it out like they should. If a teacher is behind on the syllabus because they are unable to manage their time or their presentation is unclear, that onus does not fall to the students to pick up the slack. Tutoring is helping a student to better understand material presented, not presenting new material outside of class time, which is what these teachers are doing. \n\n\nAlso, I'm not trying to be rude but unless you are a student this or last semester, you really have no idea what we are going through. This is an unprecedented semester and having people who went to college during non-pandemic times, and have no idea what the experience of the students of today is like, telling us to buck up is rude, uninformed, and condescending.",

I do know how hard life is for students right now because I have a child in school and I work in education in a very low income part of humboldt county. We are all hurting. The commitment you are making to your education is commendable and no doubt extremely difficult. Unfortunately none of that has any bearing on the university's obligations. I see student, parent, and community outrage all the time and in my experience it is often rooted in misunderstanding of what the educational code is and what the policies of the institution are. The original post is basically an opinion of how you think things should run at HSU, but to my knowledge there is nothing in the CSU code or HSU policy to back that up. If I'm wrong more power to you. Find the policy that was broken and raise a stink. I don't think that's the case though. If the purpose of your post was to vent then yeah I get it. If it was an indictment of hsu and the professor then I can't say I agree. Is life hard wqright now, yes. Does  it suck, probably. Were your rights violated? I don't think so.",

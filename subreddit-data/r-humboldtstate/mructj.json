                            "comment": "Okay, share this with your uncle.\n\nThe Netflix 'documentary' made much of a local newspaper cover article featuring [the faces of missing people](https://www.northcoastjournal.com/humboldt/the-humboldt-35/Content?oid=7775161). The same week that was published, one of the missing women was appearing on NBC's *The Bachelor* TV show.\n\nThe newspaper [acknowledged this the same day](https://www.northcoastjournal.com/NewsBlog/archives/2018/02/01/not-missing-in-humboldt-bachelor-contestant-bekah-martinez). Readers were fast to point out to the newspaper that they'd found the lady.\n\nThe editor of a local news website, which coincidentally is helmed by a smarmy former editor of the print newspaper I just linked, published this: [PEOPLE! Let\u2019s not freak out too much about Humboldt\u2019s state-highest rate of missing persons seports, OK](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2018/feb/8/guys-lets-not-freak-out-about-humboldts-supposed-e/) and later this, [Oh dear God, please not again with this horseshit about Humboldt County\u2019s missing persons rate](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2019/jan/23/oh-dear-god-please-not-again-horseshit-about-humbo/).\n\nThe gist of those articles is that, yes, Humboldt County leads California in the number of missing person reports, but Humboldt County also leads California in the number of *found* missing persons.\n\nAsk yourself why the documentary would play up the missing person angle, and not the reality? At its core, Netflix documentaries are *entertainment*.\n\n -----------\n\nHere is my take on why Humboldt has so many reported missing persons.\n\nThe cannabis industry relies on seasonal workers known as trimmigants. This job is romanticized, presumably by listless and lost urban travelers who look homeless, but aren't quite homeless. \n\nI've only seen a trimmigrant hangout one time, in Willits, California (a 2.6 hour drive from Arcata in Lake County). A good 40+ people in their twenties hanging in and around a fast food restaurant flipping through their cell phones. I had to ask a non-phone flipping local what I was observing. This was a pick-up spot for trimmigant labor, doubly so because it was raining and the other major fast food place down the street didn't have a roof overhang to keep people dry outside. They weren't eating. They were lingering quietly to themselves doing nothing on a rainy day in a nowhere little town in and around a fast food joint.\n\nAdditionally, Humboldt is reportedly a fair weather stop on a west coast circuit for urban travelers (not just trimmigants... think young homeless drug abusers, lost souls, etc.) as they hitchhike between San Francisco and Portland.\n\nNow imagine Mom is unhappy about her son Johnny. He last called home while on the road and said he might head to Humboldt, maybe to find trim work, maybe just because he's heard [Big Rock Candy Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rock_Candy_Mountain) tales of Humboldt.\n\nBut then Johnny doesn't call home again within the time frame that nervous Mom expects and what does she do? She calls the Humboldt County sheriff to file a missing person report because it's the only lead she has.\n\nMaybe Johnny is just bad about calling home. Maybe Johnny passed through Humboldt and is elsewhere. Maybe Johnny is working on a remote cannabis farm out of cell range. Maybe Johnny never headed to Humboldt at all. And when Johnny calls home again, Mom doesn't call that far away sheriff to report that Johnny is safe and found.\n\nIncidentally, the young woman who was lost, and then found appearing on *The Bachelor*... she had come to Humboldt to work on a cannabis farm.\n\nThat Netflix entertainment show your uncle watched did have a serious crime at its core, but there are serious crimes everywhere. Even if Alderpoint (aka 'Murder Mountain') posed a real threat to you, it's a 2 hour drive from Arcata. What horrible places are within a 2 hour drive from where you live right now? Is your uncle worried for your safety because those places exist?\n\nPlacate your uncle by these simple rules: 1) don't grow or sell cannabis illegally, 2) don't work on a cannabis farm, 3) don't drive into the mountains and drive down dirt roads you don't have any business being on, and 4) when hiking in a state park, stay on the trail. Done.",

I heard that humboldt was unsafe from people who lived in redding and I thought well then why is it rated in the top 5 chill towns in California. Humboldt is full of hippies I think the most dangerous thing here is ourselves like we bring all these fears and anxiety with us. I have been in multiple towns in California and I feel safer here than anywhere including Georgia! I\u2019m an hsu student and I live off campus I have two dogs and two cats meanest person I met literally was just an immature 18 yr old who didn\u2019t know how to live on her own and she was looking for a roommate. Everyone I\u2019ve met is super nice and like any place in the world there is crime but not super crazy shit I\u2019ve never seen anything just heard of like 3 things since I\u2019ve been here and they were not even that bad I do know that mckinleyville has been said to be racist but I have never met anyone racist here I\u2019ve just heard of things from people who went to some stores in mckinleyville",

That, or your family belongs to a cult and nobody is supposed to leave the compound.\n\nHow weird of them. Humboldt is as safe as any other place, and a lot safer than many places.\n\nI've lived here 30 years and raised my family here. Safety is not a serious concern I have, except in scenarios that would be a concern in any town or city in this country.\n\nEdit: I see you're from Sacramento. I grew up there. I'd choose Humboldt over Sacramento any day. Every day. I escaped Sacramento. After you graduate and decide to stay here, and your parents near retirement, I'll bet good money your parents move to Humboldt to be safer and closer to you.",

I went to UCSC my freshman year and it was eye opening. I grew up in the suburbs and thought that was the best I could get, oh was I wrong. I went in majoring in business and left searching for a job outside. Might I add that I am single child hahaha",

I feel safe on campus but walking around Arcata at night yeah I'll definitely take a pocket knife even if it doesn't help me at all, puts my mind at ease. The lighting around Arcata can be really off-putting with a sparse amount of lampposts but it is fine overall. The only people I have ever come close to being in conflict with is a few homeless people. It is about as safe as I feel anywhere else. Just be sure to utilize caution like you would anywhere else, it is a crazy world and all that.",

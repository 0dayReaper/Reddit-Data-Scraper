    "postText": "I am Trans and was rejected from the Rainbow Housing Community.  I'm being told to choose between Canyon and Hill, but neither have gender neutral bathrooms.  I don't want to live somewhere I don't feel safe.  Should I live off campus?  Are there any resources for finding trans affirming people to live with?  Nice that Humboldt has a gender diversity dashboard and a trans taskforce - not so nice that they wont provide trans freshmen a safe place to live - I got my housing application in within minutes of it opening.  I'm starting to think I made a mistake choosing Humboldt.  They were rated high on the Campus Pride Index, but LGBTQ friendly doesn't apparently translate to Trans friendly.",

Don't give up hope though, we do continue to get cancellations, so there's a chance you may be able to be assigned to live there later if you were just waitlisted. If you were actually denied, it maybe be because of your responses to the questionnaire. If that's the case, you could redo your responses and send them to [housing@humboldt.edu](mailto:housing@humboldt.edu) so they can be reviewed. Once you have a room assignment if it's not in Rainbow, submit the Room Change Request Form, to make sure that your request to live in Rainbow is still active. You can find the form in your [myHousing portal](https://myhousing.humboldt.edu) under Forms. Not all LGBTQ students living on-campus, including Trans students live in the Rainbow community. It's still possible for you to live elsewhere on-campus and have a good experience and a safe environment. You can use the Roommate Finder in the [myHousing portal](https://myhousing.humboldt.edu), review profiles and see if you connect with anyone by messaging them. If you have further questions, please email [housing@humboldt.edu](mailto:housing@humboldt.edu)",

            "comment": "&gt;not so nice that they wont provide trans freshmen a safe place to live\n\nThe housing set aside form LGBTQ+ students being full indicates the opposite is true, that Humboldt does provide trans first year students with safe places to live. It's just that there are more such students than Humboldt anticipated needing the housing.\n\nIf you don't feel safe in regular housing, and the Rainbow Housing is definitely full, then you will need to find an off-campus rental. That said, if you live on campus and are treated poorly by students in the residence halls, file a complaint each and every time. Something will be done.\n\nIn my era, a couple decades before society came around to accepting LGBTQ+ folks, the university would relocate LGBTQ+ students who were uncomfortable with their assigned rooms. Today, I would expect disciplinary action to be taken against the offending students, and if that's not the case, I'd go straight to the [Ombuds Office](https://president.humboldt.edu/ombuds) and file a complaint there.  An 'ombudsman' is a neutral third party that addresses disputes. \n\nI used the office once and my complaint was resolved in my favor. I had made flyers criticizing the university, had them approved for posting, and posted them. Two weeks later I had a new round of critical flyers and this time I was refused approval out-of-hand. The Ombudsman spoke to unspecified administrators and then I was allowed my free speech. \n\nMy complaint led to a change in flyer policy (limiting the number of flyers that can be posted around campus), but I was still allowed to post my flyers under the new number limit.",

It's not their job.

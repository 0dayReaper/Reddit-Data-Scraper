Can anyone offer some less obvious things that someone from SoCal might overlook when packing to move up to Humboldt?  Or just any all-around advice for someone hoping to be a new student?",

Not having mine stopped me from getting a job for a little while. I ended up having to wait until someone back home could find it and ship it to me in the dorms.\n\nGloves because it gets cold and the bookstore will overcharge you, and if you don't have a car available, it may be hard to access a store that'll sell you good ones at a good price. I was walking home from work for a while a mile a day during the night and my pant pockets didnt cut it for me.",

The lack of sun really gets to some people but, you will need layers because the ocean quickly changed the weather. \nInvest in some hiking shoes and just ask a group of people in one of your classes if they want to go on a hike (strawberry rock is super popular and close)\nIf you\u2019re really having a hard time away from home there are resources on campus, if you need them don\u2019t be afraid to use them. \n\nI lived in the area for two years and as a community college student from out of town I  had several friends and acquaintances from high school attending HSU at the same time so I have a mixture of experience. I found that there were quite a few students from humboldt state who ended up at the community college but, they definitely felt awkward by being there or something, idk how to describe it. But, even so I say who cares which school you\u2019re at! Take full advantage of clubs, student body, and such things. I didn\u2019t really get into any of that stuff at first because I didn\u2019t *know* if it matters but, these things are nice and do not be afraid to figure out how to start your own club if you don\u2019t find the one you\u2019re looking or hoping for! If you have enough people any club is allowed to exist provided it\u2019s not racist, discriminatory or disrespectful in nature. \nI hope you have a good time! Feel free to pm me about anything\nAlso fair warning, nude beaches and nudity at some of the river spots is totally normal and completely acceptable",

            "comment": "* A collapsible umbrella. It's a lot easier to store when you're in a classroom.\n\n* A desk fan. Maybe this has changed, by in the mid-1990s there wasn't air conditioning in the residence halls due to our mild climate. Some rooms can get quite warm if your window faces the afternoon sun.\n\n* Water shoes to slip into and out of when showering (athlete's foot, a general concern in any communal restroom scenario).\n\n* If you are bringing a car, then a Costco membership. If your parents are married, remove the parent who shops there alone the least and add yourself. Our region has one of the highest prices for gas in the country. Costco runs 25 to 30 cents less expensive than everywhere else. It does mean driving to Eureka, but Eureka also has the least expensive grocery stores (WinCo Foods and Grocery Outlet) and the bulk of other shopping options (Target, a mall, etc.).  Install the Target and Walmart apps. They tell you what merchandise is available in-store.\n\n* If you bring a printer, be sure it does wireless printing. It expands your room configuration options.\n\n* The latest model of Chromecast, \"Chromecast with Google TV.\"  Don't buy the older 3rd generation model. If your parents have streaming accounts, many of them will allow an additional screen (e.g., you) or can be upgraded to add you. The Chromecast dongle is small and portable to take wherever there might be a screen and can be more pleasant than casting everything from a phone (Chromecast does make casting easier, but it also has a remote and native apps for most streaming services). It's also the most open platform. Roku and Amazon have blocked the Peacock and HBOMax apps recently trying to shake down those companies for more money. Google's Chromecast doesn't pull that crap.",

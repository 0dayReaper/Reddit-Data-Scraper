    "postText": "I\u2019m taking BA 252 and we need access to the course for HW. But my professor said if I took 250 last semester I wouldn\u2019t need to pay for the book. However, it says I need to pay for access to the hw and course. When I asked her if I needed to pay that, she said I shouldn\u2019t need to. Currently, I\u2019m using the two week free period. \n\nMy question is, buying the e book says it doesn\u2019t give access to the course. So do I have to pay access for each individual course I take that uses this program? Or is it a, buy a connect access and be able to access any of your assigned classes that use it sort of thing? \n\nSorry if I wrote this out a little confusing. I\u2019m very confused and would like to know whether or not I need to pay $150 to access the hw or not.",

However it\u2019s a completely different class and from what I know I still need to pay to get access to the HW. Someone in class told me to use the link in canvas but that only let me do the two week free period. \n\nAs far as I know we don\u2019t have a discussion board and I was hoping someone else in the class would see this post. If it doesn\u2019t get answered, I plan to come into class on Thursday and ask again",

I have to paid for several classes where they must require you to buy the codes for hw and the price is steep. They were like $150 per class. Idk any other cheaper methods to get around with it. They don\u2019t sell any alternative codes on the internet \u2639\ufe0f lmk if you find a soultion",

Ended up emailing customer service for connect and they helped me figure it out. Check the access code stuff you bought when you took ba 250, it should tell you how many semesters of access it gives. Then reach out to the company directly",

There\u2019s a unit cap at some point that you\u2019d have to appeal if you were taking classes for a lifetime but I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any time limit. Although if you\u2019re paying part time tuition you might want to take 2 classes at a time to get a little more bang for your buck.",

There is a winter market November to March, but most of the things I buy would be out of season. There are more plants and non-food items being sold in the winter.\n\n[Check these photos](https://www.google.com/search?q=arcata+farmers+market&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03DTLnWlyIcGEoSCECFdKdSINkVLA:1597609318914&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwibhca_xqDrAhXdGDQIHYY6DUgQ_AUoAnoECDUQBA&amp;biw=1223&amp;bih=781). The main season market is an event every Saturday... heavily attended, usually with a band playing.\n\nFarmers sell to certain local grocery stores as well.",

If you\u2019re a broke college student tho I suggest winco and grocery outlet. It\u2019s really about how much money you have. Locally, poor people don\u2019t really do to the farmers market stuff.

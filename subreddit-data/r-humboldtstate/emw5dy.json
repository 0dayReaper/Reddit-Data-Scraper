    "postText": "I'm a transfer student coming to HSU this upcoming semester and I have a single room in College Creek. When I looked at the floor plan for my room, I decided that I wanted to rearrange some of the furniture, but when I looked at the housing handbook it said that moving furniture around isn't allowed. Is this actually enforced or do people still move stuff around without any issues? Also are we not allowed to bring in other pieces of furniture like bedside tables?",

Just make sure its back to normal for room inspections or move out day, one of those.  You can bring in furniture, i brought a chair and a nightstand type of thing.",

Also considering CSUF and CSU San Bernardino (I\u2019m from the Inland Empire lol) so if you happen to have any opinions on Humboldt versus those two schools that\u2019d be nice :)",

It\u2019s was a small major so I got a lot of individual attention, knew my professors and classmates really well, and was able to get a ton of hands-on experience right away. I highly recommend it. \n\nLike the other comment said, it can be pretty print-oriented but there are some incredible broadcast instructors/programs/classes as well. And an amazing student-run radio station, KRFH!!",

Because we\u2019re so rural, we have 1 local news station in Eureka, so I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of places to get practice/jobs in real broadcast situations. But I\u2019d keep seeking more info from actual program attendees for sure!",

            "comment": "JMC Alum here. Teachers are mostly good, the best are lifers, the worst move on quickly. Broadcast is fun, especially if you get involved with the campus radio. Lumberjack is cliquey, go there if all your friends are there. Not many opportunities for broadcast in the community though. Humboldt is a great place to get an education, both formally and informally. Consider your other interests too, HSU has awesome art / science programs and good reasons to double major.\n\nI'd only advise against it if you know you have addiction problems, or tend towards co-dependence. I know too many people who fell into the \"life\" there and never got out of it, ending up with their children taken away, felony records, addicted and/or homeless. It could be argued they would have ended up in the same situation, regardless of living in Humboldt, but isolation forces independence, and some people can't handle freedom.\n\nI'd recommend Media Studies as a concentration, that has much more applicability in the world outside of college. Broadcast / writing is fun, but you just end up doing piecemeal work for pennies. Media Studies is more scholarly, and that's the interesting part of media anyway, is how it impacts and shapes society.\n\nI also dated a few journalism women, smart, crazy cookies, the lot of em.",

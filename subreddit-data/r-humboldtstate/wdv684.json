The reason why GPA can be competitive is if the program is impacted so then it\u2019s a competition. \n\nAnother way to get rejected is that certain programs have a school within the school like some music programs. \n\nExample. You can get into Long Beach state but not accepted into their music school. Idk if other majors have the same thing",

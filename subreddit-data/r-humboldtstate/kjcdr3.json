The frustrating part is how small the department is (like most other departments at hsu). You won\u2019t have access to the same kinds of classes than you would at a bigger school but if that\u2019s okay with you I think it\u2019s worth it.",

Some of it is due to Covid, but I had a class last semester with only 15 people, and then last year I had one with like 12 people who showed up. All of the profs are knowledgeable and willing to work with you, especially Marschke and Geck. Classes are fun for the most part but intensive to where you need to pay attention. You will make some good friends tho because it is a smaller major. Kind of hard to not run into some people you already know.",

It does not guarantee admission, particularly not in impacted majors.\n\nGenerally speaking, if you are a high school students and are within the required range of English and Math placement scores, or if you are a community college student who has completed their Golden Fours and at least some of their major preparation courses, you can be conditionally admitted.\n\nFinal admission will be pending your transcripts, completion of pending courses, and anything else that may impact your transfer (approved placement on a sports team if you are coming in as a student athlete, completion of required courses for impacted majors, eligibility criteria being met, etc.).\n\nDefinitely don't make any rash decisions based on a conditional acceptance, even less so if your major is considered impacted.",

My first year and a half I had outstanding teaching, which is why I stayed in the program. Once you get to taking certain teachers, it gets really really bad. Not worth your money bad. I do know that A LOT of students complained to the dean of student and the CS department chair. If they make significant changes based on that, the department would be be amazing. If not, it will be a waste of your or your family\u2019s money.",

TBH things started to feel kinda normal considering how low cases were in Humboldt County (and I come from LA, so I knew what it was like to live in a covid hot spot). I was also desperate to move away from home and start living independently. The liberty of doing what you want and when you want is worth it. I hope you like the outdoors too cuz you're stuck inside your dorm on zoom long enough, you need to have motivation to go outside at least. Also, I had nothing holding me back at home (lost most my friends in the summer and I love my parents but not that much) so if you're in the same boat I say you come up for Spring semester.",

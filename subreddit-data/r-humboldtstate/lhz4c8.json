    "postText": "Hi all! I just applied as a lower division transfer and I really hope I can get in. How long does it usually take for the school to acknowledge your application and send you your login info? And when do decisions usually come out? Aaaahh I'm super excited. Sorry for being a weirdo about it!!! Lol. I'm guessing my chances of getting in are much much lower than an upper division transfer or even freshman, but im still hopeful! I will apply again in the future if I don't get in.",

HSU has an acceptance rate of like 90%. Unless you didn't meet the bare minimum requirements, I think you'll be fine.",

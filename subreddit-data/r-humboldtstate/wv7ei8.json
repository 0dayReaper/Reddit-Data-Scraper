I know Canyon is pretty much off limits because of all the stairs getting up to the buildings, but I wasn\u2019t sure if Cypress was more accessible since you don\u2019t really have to do stairs to get from the quad to the walkway overlooking the Cypress Lawn.",

Even first floor Canyon and Cypress dorms require you to walk up steps to get there. Top floor Cypress dorms are also slightly accessible and connect to the JGC and Hill dorms. \n\nAll around I will say that Humboldt is a wildly inaccessible school. Even if a person receives accommodations for housing, all of the classes are only accessible via LOTS of stairs or steep ramps and nearly all of the dining halls have stair access too. There are very few elevators in campus buildings in general and there aren\u2019t elevators in the dorms despite every dorm having multiple floors.",

There\u2019s a path from the volleyball court outside of the Hill that leads directly to the dorms, no stairs required. There was a guy in a wheelchair in the suite next to mine, so that floor was definitely handicap accessible!",

            "comment": "The university has something like 5 housing projects in various stages of starting. The first one should be ready in one to two years I believe, and will surely be accessible. It's more for independent living though because it's off-campus.\n\nThe Canyon complex is served by elevated walkways that connect to the second floor of the Jolly Giant Commons. In my time (the 1990s) the whole area was wheelchair unfriendly / nearly impossible. So the question is whether any of the Canyon buildings have an elevator now.  Here's a [walk around the Canyon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21l3Bfniiq8).\n\nJudging by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyNcZlDUORE) there are multiple elevators serving the JGC building now which houses the cafeteria, mail room, administrative and meeting rooms, rec room, and convenience store.\n\nIF Cypress is still not served by an elevator, it relegates wheelchair access to the ground, second or top floor. The top floor is preferable if you favor access to the main campus. The ground and second floor is preferable if you favor access to the JGC (because you'll have a series of elevators to get to the main level of the campus). \n\nThere is a [shuttle for students with disabilities](https://disability.humboldt.edu/servicesavailable-transportation) which can help get a wheelchair user to various classes on campus.\n\nOffhand, I'd think The Hill would be the most accessible of the freshman housing units because it's located on the main level of the campus. It does house a lot of students per floor though. Very lively.",

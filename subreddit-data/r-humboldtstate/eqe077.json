My experience as a transfer was that I had to go to undeclared until I met them. \n\nListed here for convenience:\n\n\nBiology, Botany, Wildlife or Zoology must have completed the following combination of coursework (three courses minimum) all with grades of C- or better:\nOne semester of pre-calculus mathematics required\nMATH 102: Algebra &amp; Elementary Function (formerly MATH 115, prior to Fall 2018)\nor higher level mathematics also accepted, e.g. MATH 109-Calculus I\n\nAnd, complete at least two of the following courses designed for majors in the sciences\nBIOL 105: Principles of Biology with lab\nBOT 105: General Botany with lab\nZOOL 110: Introductory Zoology with lab\nCHEM 109: General Chemistry I with lab (one semester of general chemistry typical for a biology major with lab).

    "postText": "Howdy all, \n\nSo I got into CSUC and SJSU. Didn\u2019t get into SDSU (needed a change of scenery from SoCal anyways). I haven\u2019t heard back from Humboldt yet. I think Humboldt is my best option and have yet to hear if I got accepted or denied. I applied for the BASW distance program and am a bit nervous to find out what\u2019s next. I know a lot of people have been accepted to Humboldt. I know a lot of people get accepted (isn\u2019t there like a 92% acceptance rate?) It doesn\u2019t mean anyone is entitled to go to this marvelous establishment, but I was really hoping I\u2019d get in, as my GPA is quite fair, and I\u2019ve made the Dean\u2019s list often enough. Any advice? Anyone else get in? Should I contact anyone. Don\u2019t want to be a bug but I really want to send in an intent to register as soon as I\u2019m able.",

I just know San Jose State and Chico have a set date of when I need to accept admission and I don\u2019t want to commit to either establishment before I know what my choices are. I am missing one little class, but they don\u2019t offer it at most schools and they said people can take it there their first semester to make up for that discrepancy.

Let me tell you.......Arcata died with covid and is not coming back anytime soon. The campus will not be open in the fall, where as Chico announced they are opening. Almost every restaurant, bar, store is closed, a lot permanently closed, boarded up and riddled with homeless sleeping in the windows and stoops. It was a sunny Friday afternoon.....and it was a ghost town. Maybe I\u2019m missing something, but I\u2019m so glad I visited because I decided to just go to Chico where things are more normal.",

I don\u2019t expect it to always be economically depressed, but it\u2019s going to take a long time to recover any sort of normalcy especially since they aren\u2019t entirely reopening in fall which is a really stupid move. Good luck at Chico! I hear it\u2019s great!",

I see that it's an option on the HSU website but there is not a lot of info on how it works. Can anyone give me some details on how it's ran as far as class meetings, turning in work, testing and any in person requirements of the program?",

We don\u2019t have a lot of testing more like a bunch of critical analysis essay and projects. We do have a test at the end of the year and a masters project.",

It seems a lot of stuff had been covered up about racism here and I wish I was aware of it before I made my decision. I just don\u2019t want anything to happen to my friend and I as we are both people of color. What areas should be avoided?",

I met so many amazing people, so many incredible unique experiences that I definitely don't regret my decision, and I feel that you and your friend won't either! It's honestly not that bad, and it's just as \"white\" as anywhere else.\n\n You will come across more diverse people, other Asians, Blacks, Mexicans, International students from Japan and Korea, and people of color teachers are there as well. \n\nYes, it has its issues but nowhere is perfect and my college experience was fantastic along with other minorities that went there. \n\nI would recommend you call Campus and get in contact with the international, or people of color student unions and talk to someone and get their experiences as well!\n\nAnywhere that's a livable distance from campus, you will be fine, as other students live off-campus and in the surrounding cities as well.",

            "comment": "As a Black HSU alum, living in Arcata, and McKinleyville for 3 years I can chime in on this. The area is very very gorgeous and if you are a fan of nature this is the best decision you'll make! The school is literally in the Redwoods, and it's the only place I can think of where you can literally walk from the Redwoods to the ocean in an hour or two and it would be a beautiful walk. Super cheap an easy to score the best damn tree and concentrates in the world! Everyone smokes and it's groovy.\n\n There is a chapter of the KKK in McKinleyville; I however lived out there for a semester and had zero issues and it was very beautiful, quiet, and serene and I really got a chance to find myself. Humboldt County it's very small and has a very small community. \n\nWith those small communities come ignorance, intolerance and confusion mixed with curiosity. And not to mention the current climate with Trump in office , you'll definitely get some looks, stares and some negative energy. Because it is a very small community with small-minded individuals. \n\nHowever, it is a college town and a lot of people there are international students, people from LA, the Bay Area and other places. So it definitely feels like a College Community with college going ons! It has a very big queer Community, hippies, smokers, city Folk, locals, and trade fund kids.  I believe it's still going on, but they also have a black sorority and fraternity there as well, including safe places and a very close tight-knit people of color  community . \n\nOverall, you will be fine and it's honestly no different from most places. Just know, that the majority of people there are white, and a lot of the locals aren't comfortable or familiar with people of color so you may come across a few weird situations; but definitely nothing that will stop you from enjoying your time there or feel too threatened. Stay strong, proud and hold yourself with confidence.\n\nIf you have any other questions or concerns, please reach out to me as I will do my best to answer them for you. I was there from 2012 to 2015, and live in Portland, but from what I'm told, things are still the same and I also have people of color friends that still live in Arcata and doing just fine.",

I've also only been going to HSU for 2 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've heard McKinleyville is by far the more racist part of the Humboldt Bay Area. That's the town just north of Arcata. Arcata itself sounds like it definitely has its share of racists, like many rural, dominantly white parts of this country, but it's also very much a college town. Meaning that - there are so many college students, many of whom are people of color like yourselves, that it has a definite influence on the culture of the city. Eureka also has its share of problems with racism, I'm sure. I know one of my coworkers in Eureka got the cops called on them while working outside, doing the same job that I as a white guy never got harassed for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, Humboldt State has at least some (if, perhaps, not as much as they should) resources to help students of color feel more comfortable and feel a part of the wider community of people around here and on campus who share their roots. I don't know how you identify, but I'll link the cultural centers on campus, (and also I assume this may help others).\n\n[https://mcc.humboldt.edu/](https://mcc.humboldt.edu/)\n\n[https://aacae.humboldt.edu/](https://aacae.humboldt.edu/)\n\n[https://lcae.humboldt.edu/](https://lcae.humboldt.edu/)\n\n[https://itepp.humboldt.edu/](https://itepp.humboldt.edu/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really sorry that folks have to deal with racists in their lives and I really hope it never becomes an issue for you while you go here. Again I don't have the best advice, but I feel like a solution for many people seems to be getting involved in some form of community, club, sport, or what have you that can give you a foundation and a place to feel welcome and cared about. Whatever that means for you. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy your time up here when you get here!",

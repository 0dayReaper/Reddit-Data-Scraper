They were maybe 50 from shore, spanning about 100 yards up and down the bike bath.  \n\n\nThough difficult to ID from afar, Dr. Allison Bronson from the Biology Dept says these are probably leopard sharks. They\u2019re right at home in Humboldt Bay, eating small fishes and invertebrates, and are a common catch by recreational anglers in Arcata and Eureka.",

            "comment": "I didn't stay in college creek, but I would ask if you can fit everything into your car?  Some people brought a uhaul trailer that they hitch to the back of your vehicle and personally I think that's too much.  I'm a relative minimalist, but I packed all my stuff into my tiny two-door car.\n\nIdk how big your room is at home, but if it's a big room, you can't bring your whole room.  Bring as much stuff as can fit in a small room because you don't wanna be that roommate whose stuff is spilling into others' spaces.  Outside of your room, you may only get 1-2 drawers in the kitchen, so don't count on storage outside your room.\n\nIn canyon, we had a pretty sizeable dresser and closet rack.  I fit most of my stuff (outside of my clothes) into or onto the large desk they provide.  You may have underbed storage too.  You'll have plenty of space, but I'm just saying if you're the opposite of a minimalist don't pack your whole room.  I'd estimate I had maybe 40 clothes on hangers and I still had plenty of room on the hanging rack.",

            "comment": "Eh there is a fair amount of storage in the common areas. It can vary based on how many people live in your apartment. The bathrooms have decent storage, there is a storage closet that has a sizable amount of space, the kitchen has some decent storage but if everyone wants to cook it will be very full. The fridge is not big enough for everyone to have everything they want. I would recommend sharing things in the kitchen like eggs, rice, beans, potatoes, etc. Your room itself can fit a fair amount and I recommend moving your bed up to the highest it can go because you can fit a lot of boxes full of supplies under the beds. The closet and dresser are about normal size.",

Honestly, to echo another commenter, don\u2019t bring more then you can fit in a car. It\u2019s better to underpack then overpack, laundry is cheap on campus after all.",

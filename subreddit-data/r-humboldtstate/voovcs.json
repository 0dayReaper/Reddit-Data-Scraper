    "postText": "I applied for the comfort inn housing just in case I need it. Should I get a meal plan since I won't have a kitchen? And if so, which one? They're offering free daily breakfast at the hotel so I would just need lunch and dinner. I can get one of the on campus meal plans or one of the commuter meal plans. Should I try to make food without a kitchen to save money? There will only be a mini fridge and a microwave",

            "comment": "I think it would depend on how often you plan to be on campus and eat there. When you use a swipe at the J, you could also get an ozzi box (to-go box) and take food back with you since it's all you can eat. So two meals in one. If you think you might only use 1 swipe a day during the week (lunch and dinner to go), the Lumberjack 125 that comes with 125 swipes might be enough for the semester. Or if you think you might eat 2 meals a day on campus during the week maybe the All Access 5 would be better.  You do have until September 1st to lower your meal plan for the fall semester. You can always upgrade later on, if you decide you don't have enough. Or just add Cpoints to your account that still gives you a 5% discount at dining locations. I know it's tricky, but feel free to email [housingcashier@humboldt.edu](mailto:housingcashier@humboldt.edu) if you need more information.",

Last semester I switched from all-access 5 day, to Lumberjack 180, to Lumberjack 125 (all in the first few weeks) after realizing that\u2019s the best value for me.\n[here\u2019s the post I made breaking down meal plans](https://www.reddit.com/r/humboldtstate/comments/sf4z2c/meal_plans_the_lumberjack_180_is_the_worst_deal/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",

    "postText": "First off Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone! \n\nSo I\u2019m a transfer student who is still weighing my options for this upcoming fall and I (and I\u2019m sure others) have questions about housing and without campus tours it\u2019s hard to get a good look at the apartments . So what do y\u2019all suggest about housing? What apartments are best? What are some pros and cons? \n\nI\u2019ll say this now thank you this page gets great responses I\u2019ve posted on other pages and get like no replies. And all this info helps me with my decision.",

It\u2019s been a long time since I lived in the dorms  but that would kinda be the first deciding factor, as there\u2019s some areas that don\u2019t require one, but some do. And do you want to share a bedroom or not? (Obviously the more space you share the cheaper it is.)",

The new dorms around the soccer field are close to the campus market place, but not near the J. But probably a bit closer to campus than the other buildings. Creek view is beautiful but up a huge hill, that you\u2019ll need to walk daily, a few times. The campus apartments were old and gross 20 years ago when I lived on campus.",

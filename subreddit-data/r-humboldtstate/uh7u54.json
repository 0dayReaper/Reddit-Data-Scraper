In some instances, a regular RN in their current job can get a salary boost by obtaining a BSN.\n\n\nThere was a huge community backlash when the original, better nursing program was closed because there was, and continues to be, a statewide and national nursing shortage. Most especially, a lot of Humboldt nurses went on to work in this county, and the surrounding counties. \n\nWhen a hospital or clinic cannot find nurses to hire, it has to hire temp nurses known as \"traveling nurses\" who get paid a lot, lot more to travel around the country temporarily filling in where needed. So not only is there a nursing shortage, but it costs healthcare facilities a lot more to pay for temps.\n\nI personally believe as a result of the backlash the university created the \"RN to BSN bridge\" program as a way to save face. Technically, the bridge program does fill a need for job positions that need a BSN, but if the university is converting local RNs to BSNs for local nurses to acquire those higher positions, then we're merely shifting the nursing shortage from BSN nursing to RN nursing.",

We are desperate for medical everything here, I have so many students who want nothing more than to become a nurse and work in their hometown (largely thanks to HCOE's HESI program and high school medical classes) and there is essentially no pathway for them to stay here. CR's nursing program is stupidly impacted with 3+ years just waiting to get in, and this new program with gobs of money behind it does nothing to help them since you have to be an rn first. Most of them end up going out of state to schools that will accept them as nursing students from day 1, and we just have to hope they still want to come back to Humboldt after 4-5 years away. I don't understand why CR can't expand their program to accept more students, or Humboldt can't just make a 4-year nursing program.",

                                    "comment": "&gt; or Humboldt can't just make a 4-year nursing program.\n\nI would bet good money that HumPoly will be restoring the very good programs it closed over the past twenty years. Nursing and Industrial Technology are just screaming to be reinstated because California needs the skilled workers those programs produced. IT was the most successful program at the university in terms of alumni working within their degree field, and in terms of alumni donations.\n\nThere is a belief some people hold that the reasons these programs were cut was mostly influenced by not being given a mandate to share the burden (make every department make a small cut to their budget). Under the previous and longest serving president (McCrone) who saw numerous budget tightening periods, McCrone required deans the share the burden, thus saving every academic program.\n\nUnder new leadership, academic programs whose budgets were closest to the dollar amount the deans were told to cut... were closed. I've heard time and again this opinion that the budget balancing wasn't any more nuanced than chopping off the right sized head.",

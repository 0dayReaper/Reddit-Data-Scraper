            "comment": "&gt;Not sure to do around here so looking for a good time!\n\nGrab a copy of the North Coast Journal outside a grocery store or in a hotel lobby. It has a weekly event and nightlife calendar.\n\n* [Farmer's Market](https://www.northcoastgrowersassociation.org/arcataplaza.html) on the Arcata Plaza is always a well-attended scene with live music.  9 a.m. to 2 p.m. every Saturday.\n\n* [Fourth of July events](https://www.reddit.com/r/Humboldt/comments/vasjrs/4th_of_july_festivities/ic54dow/)\n\n* [Arts Alive!](https://www.facebook.com/artsalivehumboldt/) is on first Saturdays of each month, 6 to 9 p.m. in Old Town Eureka. Stores stay open late, live music, etc. Arcata has its smaller [Arts! Arcata](https://arcatamainstreet.com/artsarcata) on second Fridays on the Arcata Plaza.\n\n* [Arcata Bay Oyster Festival](https://arcatamainstreet.com/oyster-festival) is on Saturday, June 25. For decades it was a free festival held on the Arcata Plaza. This year there is an admission charge and it's being held in a field somewhere. Your mileage may vary.\n\n* [Humboldt Folklife Festival](https://humboldtfolklife.com/all-day-free-fest-1) the weekend of July 16th in Blue Lake is big if you like folk music. Not that I expect many college students do, but it's free live music all day Saturday and outside in a park setting.\n\n* [The county fair](https://www.humboldtcountyfair.org/) runs August 18 to 28th in Ferndale. Tickets are less expensive if you buy them now. Ride tickets are extra.\n\n* [North Country Fair](http://www.northcountryfair.org/) is on the Arcata Plaza September 17-18.",

            "comment": "If you like going out for drinks and playing arcade games, Arcada and dead reckoning are great spots for that. They close pretty early though, around 10-11  pretty much everyday. The cider bar is a great spot to hangout and grab some pie. There are also plenty of great hikes around here, highly recommend dow loading the all trails app if you're into that kind of thing. In all honesty though, I've been here about a year now and still haven't found a whole lot to do outside of going to the bars, seeing the occasional shows put on by local bands and watching movies at the Arcata Theater Lounge. It's super mellow up here and doesn't have a huge nightlife scene like they do in SoCal.",

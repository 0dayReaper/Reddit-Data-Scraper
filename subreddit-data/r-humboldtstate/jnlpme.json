            "comment": "Well, late to the party, but here's the summary from me:\n\n* Rainproof footwear is a must - if you like galoshes/rubber boots, more power to you, if you don't, a good pair of hiking boots with several coats of Scotchgard will get you most of the way there.\n\n* Side note on boots: try walking in a 1/8-1/4 inch of standing water with them before deciding to bring them.  I had many a day sitting in wet jeans because my shoes kicked the water up on my calves/thighs as I walked.\n\n* Rain jacket and umbrella.  While we don't get high winds, there is a constant wind due to the ocean, so having a wind/inversion proof umbrella is a solid investment.  I got one with wind pressure equalizing slits, and it served me well for years.  Even with a good umbrella, you will want a rain jacket of some form, because wind+rain=horizontal water, not to mention the constant humidity will get most sweaters, flannels, and so on mildly damp.\n\n* Layers, layers, layers.  If you are not afraid of a bit of a chill, and bundle up on top, you can get away with shorts and a hoodie well into October if not early November.\n\n* Waterproof bag: a lot of people seem to like the kind of cycling backpacks where you can roll up the opening to ensure no water gets in.  It works.\n\n* Waterproof notebooks: for outdoors majors, they're just about a necessity.  The most common brand is Rite in the Rain, and you can buy it at the bookstore at super-inflated prices, or at Ace Hardware for mildly inflated prices...  or you can preempt the problem and order some ahead of time from the cheapest source possible.\n\n* Coffee/tea thermos.  It keeps you warm inside, and getting your coffee into a reusable container is cheaper than buying a paper cup with it.  Hot water for tea is available at food outlets for free (or at least it was pre-covid), bring your own teabags, save money.",

Humboldt weather is super fickle in my experience, some mornings might be freezing and by afternoon it'll be sunny and warm. Depending on your interests/major, I think investing in some good hiking boots (or fire/logging boots) is also pretty necessary, especially if you're outdoors-y.\n\nGood luck &amp; enjoy your time up here!",

            "comment": "Welcome, [u/cupofhotgreentea](https://www.reddit.com/user/cupofhotgreentea/)!\n\nGreat question, and we can confirm the comments about a rain shell, layers, and good shoes. As they say, there's no bad weather - just bad clothes. And most times, and simple hoodie is the ideal jacket. Here's an article we put together about handling the rain here:[http://now.humboldt.edu/news/how-to-survive-an-arcata-winter/](http://now.humboldt.edu/news/how-to-survive-an-arcata-winter/)\n\nBut.\n\nThe *legend* of Humboldt being an unending deluge might be a little bit exxagerated- and that's fine. Rain's kind of our thing. And we do get more rainfall than the average American. More on that below.\n\nOne thing to expect is gray drizzle, light rain, \"fogging\", etc. It's the kind of thing where your windshield wipers should be on, but just barely. Full-on downpours don't regualarly happen here the way they might in, say, New Orleans. It's just damp, a lot. So don't skimp on the self-care: diet and exercise can keep your spirits up through those days.\n\nSo how rainy is it here? Consider that cities *without* rainy reputations like Louisville and Atlanta get more rain than Arcata. And if you're coming from a famously sunny part of a sunny state like California, it'll feel rainy. We get triple the rain days that LA gets.\n\nIf it helps, here are a few average annual rainfall numbers:\n\n* LA: 15 in.\n* SF: 21 in.\n* US: 38 in.\n* Portland: 44 in.\n* **Arcata: 46 in.**\n* Houston: 50 in.\n* Atlanta: 52 in.\n* Miami: 62 in.\n\nThe good news is that we can handle our rain. There are definitely times when it'll be a grind, but people still get exercise, do errands, go to class, hang out. Rain is rarely a dealbreaker the way central valley heat might be, or how midwestern snow might be. It's water, it dries. And it's cozy studying weather, too.\n\nAnother upside of this climate is that it's very mild. It's usually in the 50s through winter and the 60s through summer. We'll get some frosty mornings and chilly days in winter. We also had some 80-degree days this summer. But we don't really have A/C in town. We don't have 100-degree weeks. And snow is so rare it's kind of a treat. (We got actual snow this year and it was AMAZING until it melted later that day.)\n\nFinal point: HSU alumni tell us *all the time* how much they miss the climate here, the smell of the rainforest, the clean air, and the climate in Arcata. Some folks grow to love it.\n\n**TLDR:** It could feel rainy if you're from a city like LA with a world-famous climate. But drizzle is more common than downpour. Our weather is not extreme. It's more manageable than, say, a snowy city like Chicago or a hot city like Bakersfield. It never gets sweltering hot, and a raincoat, warm gloves and good shoes will solve most issues.We really hope that helps!",

Departments rely heavily on adjunct professors that are grad students and may not know how to really teach. There's a lack of structure in pedagogy with 'grad student's as instructors. I know this comment will be down voted as there are plenty of professors and students that are in complete denial of this reality seeing that they're quite comfortable in their projects and department while totally ignorant to the systemic problems rampant across all departments. Unfortunately even the STEM departments are lacking but again due to juking the numbers you won't see this. If you really dig in, HSU foundations are collapsing like a house built on a steep slope.",

Majority of the weekday, I just walked to and from school but for groceries and stuff I usually drove to Eureka. Also for traveling to different hiking spots. Make sure your car is in top shape before heading out to humboldt so there\u2019s no nuisances",

But......\n\nIf you need to go to Eureka or any of the surrounding towns it'd be a lot easier to do with a car than with the bus. There's not a whole lotta public transportation up here, unfortunately.\n\nAnd if you ever want to go visit back home up north (I'm guessing somewhere in Oregon perhaps) then you'll need a car unless you take Greyhound and I'm not sure Greyhound goes up there.\n\nHumboldt is a beautiful county and pretty dang big and spread out. You can go inland to swimming holes like in Willow Creek. Or if you want to travel down south like to Garberville or Ukiah or to the Lost Coast you'll want a car!\n\nSo if you're wanting to take full advantage of all the wonderful day trips to all the wonderful beautiful hiking and adventuring spots up here in Humboldt I'd day definitely bring a car!\n\nHope that helps!",

On the other hand, we had plenty of opportunity to explore the wilder areas, get stuck behind a mudslide on unmarked roads (it actually was a blast), go to the beach whenever, etc.  Oh, and travel home was never too difficult.\n\nI'd say bring it, esp. if you'll be off campus.",

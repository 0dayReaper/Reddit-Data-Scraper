    "postText": "Hi, I am transferring to Humboldt into the Oceanography program and was wondering if anyone had any experience with it? How are the professors? Opportunities after your bachelor's? Opportunities during your bachelor's? How often are you working in the field, and what are you doing while you are there?\n\nAny information at all would be great, Thanks!",

            "comment": "I was Engineering and switched to Oceanography. The professors in Oceanography are incredible, very passionate and helpful. It's a pretty small major, so you get a lot of one on one time to ask questions and get a feel for what you could fo after you graduate. You'll get tons of time on the R/V coral sea, which may be the best thing you can put on an undergrad job application. \nI can't say I used my major to stay in the Oceanography field, but it gave me more credibility and experience moving forward than most any other major would have.\nI know a lot of people who went on to grad school and mostly work for NOAA.",

I agree that the professors I had were great and I really enjoyed the classes I took in the program. It's good to be aware that many jobs in the field of oceanography will require a graduate degree of some sort, so work hard and think early about specific subareas you are interested in and focus on building those skills. You will very likely need to have programming skills for data analysis no matter what subfield you are interested in.",

My parents want me to have the regalia for graduation pictures/keepsakes, but I\u2019m not seeing anything on the HSU Bookstore site or anything else. If not, I can just order a generic set online but as cheesy as it sounds I\u2019d be a little bummed.",

I visited the cite and it didn't give me an option to buy any of them (also apparently you can't buy the gown you can only rent them).  So I think we're out of luck until it gets closer to the spring commencement. I took my senior pictures around campus last week anyway and I'll take some more when I get the cap and gown.",

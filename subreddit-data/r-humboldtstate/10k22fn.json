    "postText": "Hello! I'm 16 (graduating 2024), I live in socal, and really want to go to school somewhere near the redwoods and the ocean \u2014 and I saw that humboldt was expanding their technology stuff, including the new software engineering program. How high of hopes do you have for it? Any word from people who are planning on doing it when it first launches? I'd LOVE going to humboldt but I'm worried I wouldn't get the best education there in my chosen topic.",

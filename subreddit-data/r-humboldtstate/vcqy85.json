    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI\u2019m going to be attending Cal Poly Humboldt this fall as a first time transfer student. \n\nI\u2019m curious for anybody who has had the all access meal plan, is it like self serve and do you have an unlimited amount of meals you can eat in a day? I\u2019d like to use the gym pretty heavily while I\u2019m attending, I\u2019m curious if it would be super time consuming if I would have to get in a line continuously to get enough food for my bodies needs? \n\nAlso, what is available in terms of food and what\u2019s the quality exactly? \n\nThanks so much for your response! \nChris",

Unlimited means that you can eat at the J every single day. 7 = everyday while 5 days= only on weekdays. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. While smaller meal plan takes away meal swipes per meal. Unlimited means you don\u2019t have to worry about running out of swipes",

Most of the food is served to you by people working there, but there are options to make sandwiches or salads by yourself and bypass a line (unless there's a line for that stuff). The food is mid. Most of the time it's passable, sometimes it sucks, and 2-3% of the time, it's good. Don't expect anything incredible because it really is not that great",

Im friends with quite a few people that bodybuild at Humboldt that had all access meal plans last year and they got along just fine. It's eggs for breakfast every morning and there's almost always something high protein with the other meals even if it doesn't taste that great",

            "comment": "&gt;do you have an unlimited amount of meals you can eat in a day?\n\nIn my time, a meal plan gave me a number of 'meal points' which obscured the cost of food in real dollars. It would see me through the year eating at The J, but eat anywhere else on campus and it was guaranteed to run out. If you ran out of meal points, you bought more. There was no unlimited plan.\n\n[Things have changed a bit.](https://housing.humboldt.edu/meal-plans) Today, there are two all-access plans that allow unlimited meals specifically in The J cafeteria. If you want unlimited, you'll want a residence hall close to The J (Canyon, Cypress and The Hill). \n\nI read that 'meal swipes' are purchasable, which suggests the components of your meal have a collective fixed cost (a swipe of your card). That's a sea change from Olden Times when every food item had a cost.",

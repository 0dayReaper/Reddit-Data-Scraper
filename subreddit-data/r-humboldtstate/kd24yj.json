    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am hoping to go to HSU next fall as a freshman. I am just a little nervous about the school's financial situation. I know it's silly to ask, but do you think that the school could go under due to less enrollment and budget cuts? I am majoring in Wildlife so I don't know if it would impact grants or the program itself. On another note, I was wondering if anybody has gone through the Klamath Connection program or has helped in the Barton Lab. Any help is always appreciated. Thanks!",

            "comment": "I don't think the University is going to close or go under. HSU is looking at becoming a polytechnic in the future which would potentially impact the social sciences and art/music departments, but programs like wildlife or anything STEM will likely remain since HSU already has a pretty hands on experiential approach to these programs anyways. This is all a few years down the road anyways though, and in the meantime the biggest changes will probably be larger classes and less class availability since they're laying off or cutting the hours of a lot of the college's lecturers. Most of the clubs and student groups have limited budgets now too. The wildlife program is fairly well known in the field, and while I haven't gone through the klamath connection program I've only heard good things. Good luck in 2021! I'll be returning from a leave of absence in the fall too, if you find yourself struggling after the move feel free to reach out.",

If there are some changes, I will just have to take it in stride. Even \"higher\" ranked institutions are having problems just like HSU so I understand. If I need some help, I will definitely reach out. :)",

The school is also moving towards becoming a polytechnic csu school which will award more grant funds towards stem majors such as Wildlife.\n\nI started off as a Wildlife major and went through Klamath Connection. It\u2019s a nice way of getting to know your peers and teachers as it keeps you in the same classes and helps walk you through the first year of school with assigned RAMP mentors who check in on you every month or so. Personally, I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Sci 100 class that is included in Klamath connections as it was a lot of busy work and felt like extended orientation. But getting to make friends the first week of school, have the same classes, and live in the same building as them was really beneficial for starting college.",

Also, the university just took control of the 8-acre Craftsmans Mall site off campus and is eyeing that for expansion. These aren't the kinds of things they and the state would be doing if there was any prospect of closure.[https://wp.me/p9ZzmG-eUG](https://wp.me/p9ZzmG-eUG)",

            "comment": "HSU will not be going under any time soon. The CSU would never let that happen. In fact, we are undergoing a self-study to become the third polytechnic school in California (like CalPoly Slo and CalPoly Pamona) so I would expect the funding to get even better in the near future. STEM here is so underrated and you get an amazing education for a great price. Professors are legit and personable. Most complaints rest with the admin but many of the problematic ones are moving on. HSU could be entering a new golden era soon. HSU is scrappy in a good way and people really care which is awesome. Lots of robotic professors and students at other universities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, Klamath Connection is a blast. You'll meet some great friends, live near them, and go to class with them. Getting to come up a week early w/ Klamath Connection (before the other general students) and get established was super fun, but don't be afraid to make new friends once the general campus gets up here too. Helps a ton with getting established and good grades your first 2 semesters while getting used to college. You'll also probably be enrolled in a SCI /FOR 100 class and you'll get to meet and work with some upper-division professors. Great snapshot of what your upper division will be like. Good luck",

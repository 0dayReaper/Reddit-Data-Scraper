            "comment": "Here's probably good advice for all HSU STEM majors, dont take SCI 100, the lower division Area E requirement normally taken by freshmen at HSU, wait till a summer semester and take some other LD GE Area E fulfilling course at your community college. In brief, doing this will save you a bunch of time and effort. Considering doing this with alot of LD GEs isn't a bad idea either.\n\nAnd then to be more major specific...\nThe intro to botany and zoology couses are tough for many students, i guess don't take them in the same semester if you can help it. \n\nThe intro to biostatistics course would probably be a pain to take online unlike Calc I or most other math courses HSU offers. Since its not a pre-req for other major courses, consider waiting till we are in person to take it. \n\nFrom experience and hearing from peers, taking Calc I is preferred to taking the BioCalc I course for biology major? Maybe something to look into really. I don't have any good details about this...\n\nUnless you are going to grad school or something, consider taking the easy route for physics, doing so will save you some units....\n\nTo emphasize the usefullness in, consider summer courses, they can save you $1,000s\n\nEdit: hopefully someone here can talk about the two math series available to Bio students, also intro to Bio Stats would be a pain online because of its coding component, you do alot of work in R in the class. And I doubt the curriculum has been modified much for online learning, another thing to look into. So unless you have some coding background...",

But I am wanting to take the bio calc instead of calc. Heard it was easier?\nFor summer courses, it looked like HSU historically doesn't offer courses required for my major in the summer, and I heard they are actually more expensive for some reason?",

If I were you, and I didnt have a busy summer coming up, I would take Calc I at my CC to free up my future schedule. Hopefully someone here can speak to the two calc courses differences. \n\nAnd for the most part you are out of luck for HSU biology course offerings over the summer. HSU does offer Calc I over the summer, usually with Dr. Evans, a very good teacher, so you have that going for you atleast.",

People told me I was crazy for combining in the same semester. It\u2019s a lot of work no lie, but I got an A in both. My best friend committed suicide in the middle of the semester so I had a lot going on to say the VERY least. Most of the class was barely scraping by and there was a 40% fail rate in zoology. It was at that point that I really learned people\u2019s opinions on what is hard are subjective and vary greatly. You know yourself and what your limits are more than anyone else!",

It is about being a professional scientist, but also about how to succeed as a Bio major at Cal Poly Humboldt.  Don't avoid SCI 100.\n\nBio Calculus is just like the other calculus course EXCEPT that the teacher uses a bunch of examples from biology rather than just physics. Don't avoid Bio Calc.\n\nLike the other posters say, the intro classes are not fluff, so you should take them seriously and plan on putting in some time.\n\nSummer classes are a really good idea and last summer you could take two courses for free if you were registered at Humboldt, which obviously is really helpful even though upper division Bio courses mostly aren't offered and it was only good for GE courses.  Not sure if they'll be free again next summer.",

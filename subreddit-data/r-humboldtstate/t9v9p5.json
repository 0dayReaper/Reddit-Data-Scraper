But also- EVERYONE is kind, and friendly for the most part. I say hello to everyone I know when I pass by them on campus. This made it an extremely open and kind environment for me. And I would recommend getting involved on campus!\n2.\tits insanely easy to date/meet people. I married the first dude I dated in Humboldt SO, I\u2019d say it\u2019s good. So much to do as far as hiking, spots to eat or explore. Dating my husband there was an absolute blast and folks there are invested in their healing so I feel itd be a healthy place for you to date. \n3.\tvery strong presence in my opinion!!and everyone is SO accepting. Everyone is trying to live their most authentic life. Be you unapologetically.",

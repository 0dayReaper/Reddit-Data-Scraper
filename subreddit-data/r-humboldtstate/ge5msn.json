I'm not really interesting in training just maybe going out and flying every once in a while or hanging out with other pilots/ people interested in planes. \n\nI'd also be interested in setting up a discord for plane chat unless one already exists of course",

I think he wants to get the sim to the point where you can log time in it. There is an EAA chapter that meets at KFOT once a month. I don't know how many active members it has. The FBO at KEKA rents a C172 and C150/2.",

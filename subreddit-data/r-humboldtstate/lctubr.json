    "postText": "I'm the parent of a prospective student from the east coast. Their focus is the Wildlife program and they've been accepted but I'm a bit concerned about Hubmoldt's location and the transient population that works in the drug trade in Humboldt County. I'm looking for some feedback on the safety of not just campus because I'm sure that's safe, but the surrounding area and camping, hiking, etc... I understand that there are risks in any area but I will say that things like the Murder Mountain documentary have me worried so I'm seeking information from people who are actually living at/near and going to Humboldt. I'd hate for them to miss out on an opportunity because of a perceived safety issue.",

            "comment": "Murder mountain was an explosive, sensationalized product that does not represent the culture or dangers in Humboldt very well at all. As /u/Amethystfir22 said, Humboldt is quite safe. Especially around the college!! Arcata is a normal small town, slightly rural and quite community oriented. The only time someone gets in a bad spot here is when they begin to get into bigger amounts of cannabis, and even then all the danger comes from who you are and how you treat those around you. Even dealing with large amounts of cannabis is very safe!! The cannabis trade around here is huge and we supply a lot to out of town stuff and most goes off without a hitch. If your student does normal life things, they\u2019ll never have an issue. I\u2019ve been here for twelve years, and came for college.",

            "comment": "Like others have said, murder mountain is very far away and unless your student purposely seeks that out they're not going to become involved in it. Arcata is great, but it is small and disconnected from the big city. Maybe think about how your student will travel back to the east coast, closest  major airports are SFO or PDX. Also there are not big stores, chains or services here so be prepared for that. But at the same time we have everything you could need. Some people have a hard time adjusting. I'm a recent graduate from the wildlife program, and it was an amazing experience. Having a Wildlife Degree from Humboldt gets you places, its a reputable program in the wildlife world. I now am graduated and live down the street from campus. I take your average safety precautions, and I've been just fine. I love Arcata and hope to stick around. Its a special place to live and the community is great here.",

We are by no means the most dangerous place, most of the drug trade is peaceful especially around the college, with illegal cheaper pot being the vast majority of it. As far as off campus goes I walk at night every night end I\u2019ve only felt unsafe twice in my three years of doing that. Of course I\u2019m a 6ft tall dark skinned man who wears hoodies so I probably look like the guys most people are scared of. That being said I\u2019ve seen drug deals go on right outside my window, a kid who went to my high school became a dealer and got killed, and both times I felt unsafe on the streets was because some really high tweeker randomly approached me in the street. As far as the trails go they are dangerous but only because of the wildlife and in experienced hikers getting themselves in bad situations. If your kid does research and knows how to deal with bobcats they\u2019ll be fine. Overall HSU and the two main towns around it are quite safe, but not perfect. Hope that helps.",

            "comment": "Netflix documentaries are entertainment shows and should be taken with a boulder of salt.\n\nThe show looked into an important crime, but needlessly over-hyped the general climate here, especially with regard to the number of missing people. Yes, Humboldt leads the state in missing person reports. Humboldt also leads the state in found people. Here is my take:\n\n\"Trimmigrants\" are 20-something transients (aka 'urban travelers'). Some transients are homeless. Some are drug addicts. Some are 'finding themselves' hitchhiking across the country. Urban travelers reportedly travel a circuit, with Humboldt being a fair weather (meaning all summer) stop between San Francisco and Portland.\n\nImagine Johnny... during one of Johnny's few phone calls to Mom, Johnny says he's thinking about going to Humboldt County to look for work on a cannabis farm. Some people have a romanticized view of these jobs and an unrealistic view of how easy they are to obtain.\n\nLater, when Mom doesn't get a phone call from Johnny as soon as she'd like, and in lieu of any other option, she calls the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office because it's the only thing she can do. And the missing person count clicks up one more. \n\nMaybe Johnny:\n\n* decided to go somewhere else. \n\n* reached Humboldt, then left to somewhere else.\n\n* is working on a cannabis farm in the middle of no where without cell service.\n\n* called Mom, but she didn't call the Sheriff's Office to let them know Johnny was found.\n\nMurder is definitely not something I've worried about living in this county for three decades and where I'm raising my kids. But, I suppose it depends on the type of lifestyle you live and the type of people you hang around. I don't have criminals as friends.\n\n[This cover of the North Coast Journal](https://www.northcoastjournal.com/humboldt/the-humboldt-35/Content?oid=7775161) was played up on the Netflix show, about an article featuring 35 missing people. The same week that article was published, one woman on that cover was [debuting on NBC's Bachelor TV show](https://www.northcoastjournal.com/NewsBlog/archives/2018/02/01/not-missing-in-humboldt-bachelor-contestant-bekah-martinez). \n\nGuess what? Mom didn't call the sheriff's office to let them know her daughter had been working on a cannabis farm and had since left the county, and, umm, signed on to a nationally broadcast TV show.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n* [PEOPLE! Let\u2019s Not Freak Out Too Much About Humboldt\u2019s State-Highest Rate of Missing Persons Reports, OK?](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2018/feb/8/guys-lets-not-freak-out-about-humboldts-supposed-e/)  - February 2018\n\n* [Oh Dear God, Please Not Again With This Horseshit About Humboldt County\u2019s Missing Persons Rate](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2019/jan/23/oh-dear-god-please-not-again-horseshit-about-humbo/) - January 2019\n\nNow, regarding cannabis in general... it's legal in California for recreational use, and you will see cannabis advertised in newspapers, on signs, etc. Your child will be exposed to cannabis just as much as a college student is exposed to alcohol.\n\nThat said, the hardest drug I do is caffeine. Cannabis was around in the 1990s when I was in college, and I didn't have trouble finding friends who didn't do cannabis, or gaining a base level of respect for students that did.",

A lot of recreation areas/hiking trails are family friendly, so you can be out in nature without being too scared about it.\n\nMostly, it comes down to common sense. I wouldn't take a sketchy gig like being a trimmer in the Murder Mountain show. I don't leave valuables in my car. I try not to go places alone at night (unless it's just somewhere like the store).

The dangerous parts of Humboldt are not really that close to Arcata. \n\nWe have wonderful camping and hiking out here, and the wildlife program is pretty stellar. If your kid does go wandering through the woods, he needs to stay fairly close to major roads or a well trafficked trail. There are still illegal grows out here, and wandering into one could be dangerous.  They are intentionally built in places where they are not likely to be discovered, but I imagine a wildlife major may be a bit more likely to stumble into one than most people.\n\nIf he has common sense and doesn't get involved in anything too shady, he should be as safe as anywhere.",

            "comment": "Humboldt County is generally very safe as long as you have the smallest level of awareness of your surroundings. I lived in Arcata from age 8 to 22, as a kid I walked to friends houses/grocery store/movies both day and night, biked to school and back, etc. and only had a few incidents where weird things happened, but nothing bad ever happened.  \nI'm going to start with nature because I'm way more scared of the nature here than I am of the people. If your child has no experience with real remote nature I would suggest he only goes out exploring with friends (preferably ones who have experience), we do have a fair number of people die/get seriously injured every year because they don't practice caution with nature (sneaker waves, rip tides, crumbling cliffs, getting stranded when the tide comes in, buried in too much sand, etc.). One of my highschool classmates entire family drown in front of them trying to save their dog from bad waves, treat the ocean with respect. Also we do have mountain lions and bears, although if you just make a reasonable amount of noise while hiking, pay attention to your surroundings, and hike with a friend they don't really pose any issue. Also follow all bear safety rules while camping, don't give the bears any reason to wander into your tent.  \n\n\nAs everyone else here said, Murder Mountain is a very over the top representation of our area. All the idiots they interviewed that had a bad experience up \"on the hill\" were most likely doing something stupid to get themselves in that situation, especially the kid who claims he was dragged from a quad. I have friends and acquaintances in both the legal and illegal growing world and their crazy stories are few and far between and usually avoidable (don't threaten people in the woods who have guns), for the most part they don't want to draw any attention that would get them raided by police.  \n\n\nOur missing persons numbers are another one that people love to bring up, but those reports generally leave out the significant fact that we also have the highest found persons numbers in the state... so take that how you want. We also have large amounts of young people, leaving home, traveling here to help grow weed, and once they get up on the hill have no way of reporting back home (no cell service up at a weed farm, no wifi, no anything), so parents call in a missing person report. We also have a large amount of people who live here because they want to leave society, they want to go missing.  \n\n\nEureka is going to be the least savory place to hang out in Humboldt, but even there you will be fine if you have any level of \"street smarts\", don't talk to the tweakers alone at night, walk in well lit areas, dont threaten anybody, dont leave anything expensive in your car, don't hang out with people who commit crimes or in areas where crimes are often committed, etc. The crime rate in Eureka is super high, but almost all of it is property crime and tweaker on tweaker violence, so it is easy to avoid if you dont live there and do hard drugs.  \n\n\nIt's just as safe if not safer to go to school at HSU as any other school in California.",

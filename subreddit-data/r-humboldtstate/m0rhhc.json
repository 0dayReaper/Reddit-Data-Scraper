I\u2019ve never done it before as I took the year off and was in the dorms before but will probably live there in the fall. I\u2019m just not sure if I should wait until the semester is starting or go before. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

When you look at places just check the availability date and specify when you can come in. Some landlords might be put off if you\u2019re \u201cearly\u201d but with how housing is right now, \u201cearly\u201d applications are best. Worse comes to worse, there\u2019s always the apartments in Arcata that are taking people in (tea garden etc). But the month before semester they may fill up fast.",

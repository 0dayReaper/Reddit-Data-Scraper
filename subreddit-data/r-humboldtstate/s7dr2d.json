Is it safe to be on campus or not? We are able to attend classes in person but we can't eat in a large dining hall?",

Covered outdoor areas can be found at the sbs (SE corner) and bss.  There is also a thousand spots to eat outside just not always covered or at a table.\n\n\nAs to safety, there was ~800 /new/ cases in Humboldt over the weekend alone. Which means there's probably around 1000 cases active in the county. You can make your own decision on how safe that sounds to you, but its not like there isn't a bunch of options available. You might just need a jacket for some of them.",

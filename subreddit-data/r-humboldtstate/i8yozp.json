            "comment": "&gt;HSU will house 1,000 residents\u2014about 50% occupancy on campus. \n\n&gt;Single occupancy bedrooms will be available for every student (at a double room rate) to encourage social distancing and the ability to quarantine away from other students if necessary.\n\n[Source](https://campusready.humboldt.edu/guide/residential-life-housing)\n\nThis pertains to the room you sleep in. You will presumably share communal spaces.\n\nThe issue bigger than your snoring is your eating. Do you want to cook every meal? If not, then look at the Canyon, Cypress, and The Hill. These three sets of residence halls comprise the original Jolly Giant Complex that made resident living a larger community. Newer residence halls are spread around the campus and are not as closely tied to a meal plan because of their distance from the cafeteria (\"The J\" located in the Jolly Giant Commons building).\n\nIn my experience in the Canyon and Cypress is that the sound privacy is pretty good. You'll hear loud music from a neighbor, but I don't recall ever hearing someone snore, and I lived in the residence halls for 4 years.\n\nI'll venture that you'll (strangely enough) have more privacy in a residence hall that has more students. In an apartment setting, the common area noise may be lower, and people much more aware of each other. \n\nThe Canyon and The Hill residence halls are more like you see in movies... straight hallways lined with many doors to each resident's room. If your door is closed, you might be home; you might not. There is less attention on the comings and goings of each resident.\n\n[Housing options](https://housing.humboldt.edu/cost-options/options).

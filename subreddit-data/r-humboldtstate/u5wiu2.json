    "postText": "Hi guys, I\u2019m considering going to Humboldt for my graduate studies (psychology). I was wondering what it\u2019s like for grad students? Will I be able to find friends my age or is campus mostly undergraduate folks? \n\nNext, how\u2019s the social life there? Is there a bar scene or do people mostly keep to themselves?\n\nFinally, Do most students live in Arcata? \n\nI appreciate your guys help. :)",

Walk into a grocery store at 9 p.m. in a surrounding town and you'll liable to run into college students in pajamas.\n\nArcata's bar scene is directly on the Arcata Plaza.",

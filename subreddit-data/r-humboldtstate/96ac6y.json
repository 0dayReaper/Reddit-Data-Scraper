I know that often, this is a very frustrating task and I want to try and make it better! I also would like to help answer questions as why we do what do. I\u2019m here for the next two hours to take your questions, so let\u2019s get this conversation started!\n\n[PROOF!](https://imgur.com/a/vMNlM1I)\n\nEDIT: This has been fun! My time is up. Keep asking questions and I\u2019ll check back periodically to answer them. You can also email me directly at krista.paddock@humboldt.edu.

All you have to do is schedule 8am classes every day and arrive two hours before.\n\nKrista, is there any way to make a few more of the 20 minute zones? A major problem friends and myself encounter is trying to drop by a professors office hours or turning in an assignment. ",

I have not read the text you reference, but your following questions I can provide some information on.\n\nCampus is discouraging single occupancy car use in a couple of ways:  1) Zimride ([https://www.zimride.com/humboldtstate](https://www.zimride.com/humboldtstate)) and Zipcar ([https://www.zipcar.com/universities/humboldt-state-university](https://www.zipcar.com/universities/humboldt-state-university)) are ridesharing and carsharing programs, respectively, that provide ways riders/drivers can maximize a car going to a particular destination (putting more people into a car making a trip anyway) and providing cars on campus for multiple users to share, so they don't have to bring a car to campus (the vendor calculates each Zipcar removes 15 cars from use at a location). \n\n We have also installed a Zagster ([http://parking.humboldt.edu/zagster-bike-share](http://parking.humboldt.edu/zagster-bike-share)) bikeshare service on campus at two locations, as an extension of the City of Arcata Zagster service.\n\nParking rates are set depending on which type of permit is required and what employee classification the permit holder has (many employees have permit fees designated as part of their union Collective Bargaining Agreement).  Non-car using students are not subsidizing car users because Parking Services is mandated to be a self-support unit on campus, so only the fees from Parking Services activities, supports those functions; no other campus funds are used for these services.\n\nAnother program discouraging student cars coming to campus is the Homeward Bound service ([http://parking.humboldt.edu/homeward-bound-program](http://parking.humboldt.edu/homeward-bound-program)), which provides express bus transportation to students during fall, winter, and spring breaks to reach the Bay Area and Los Angeles.\n\nTo find out more about all these programs and talk with someone directly, you can attend the upcoming [Alternative Transportation Fair](https://www.humboldt.edu/events/featured?trumbaEmbed=eventid%3D304324805%26view%3Devent%26-childview%3D%26returnUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.humboldt.edu%252Fevents%252Ffeatured) on August 17th.",

Though many people including myself were active on campus playing chess when we were in person. I had a person I would meet and play with frequently, and you'd see people playing in the library and elsewhere on campus. I play on Lichess, if you'd like to play some games sometime, pm me and Ill send you my Lichess account.",

I made a friend playing chess in the library the other day and was wondering if there was a chess club! With us being in person (finally) as of the Spring 2022 semester, I would like to see if we can start one up. DM, let me know! \n\nI'll also make a quick post on this subreddit in case anyone is actually checking it. Possibly put-up flyers! Just need an advisor to sign...",

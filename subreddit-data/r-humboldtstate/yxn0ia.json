    "postText": "I'll be starting at HSU in the Fall of 2023 as a Junior year transfer student. I will be living on campus in most likely College Creek Campus apartments. I'm trying to get a head start at getting all my ducks in a row. \n\nAnyone with experience in those dorms or any of them really what is included in the rooms and the apartments. What furniture or appliances are provided in the kitchen, bathroom, living room, bedrooms, and the building in general? \n\nAny information is super helpful; just trying to be prepared!",

The living rooms have couches, end tables, a dining room table and chairs. You can find more information on our website, [https://housing.humboldt.edu/options/college-creek-apartments](https://housing.humboldt.edu/options/college-creek-apartments), including a virtual tour [https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=ysmYassNodb](https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=ysmYassNodb). Although the apartments are different in each area, they all come with the same furnishings (although not all areas have dishwashers, and some beds in other areas are regular twins). If you have any further questions, please feel free to email [housing@humboldt.edu](mailto:housing@humboldt.edu)",

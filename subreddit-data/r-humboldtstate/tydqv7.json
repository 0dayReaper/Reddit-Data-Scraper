They are alright but I did housekeeping for HSU a few years ago and when we went to clean that building over the summer it was infested with roaches. They had to bomb it like 6 times that summer to try and get rid of them. I also found it very weird that the door into the apartment is a sliding glass door.",

If you\u2019re open to living off campus my apartments has a few one bedrooms and two bedrooms that are available. My landlord is still working on them to get them ready for new tenants. They are walking distance to HSU about 10-15 minutes depending on where you are trying to go on campus. It honestly sucks that they make a meal plan required for most of the dorms makes you spend way more money than you want to.",

I did the math and living in a studio by myself was cheaper than every single on campus and most doubles, before we even got to a meal plan. When I transferred, I was worried about making friends and meeting people, but orientation and my classes meant that I made a lot of friends. But it can also be hard to find off campus housing, and there\u2019s other things you have to deal with. \n\nI know you said on campus, but college creek is really the only nice housing on campus and it\u2019s pretty expensive. \n\nI know a lot of other transfers looked down on the ones that moved on campus as children who didn\u2019t grow up and didn\u2019t know how to be an adult. And maybe that was just jealousy but honestly I doubt it. Because honestly the only plus I can think of to living on campus is the meal plan so you don\u2019t have to cook for yourself but can still eat a varied and nutritious diet. And If you\u2019re cooking for yourself, you can probably live off campus with a roommate or by yourself just fine.",

The whole complex seems super fucking safe. My neighbor accidentally left her door OPEN for a weekend and came back and everything was fine. None of us have had packages stolen or anything either. \n\nThe studio and 1br apartments are small but that\u2019s not too bad. My only complaint is that I have a downstairs unit and the fire alarm is ver sensitive. \n\nWhere do you live now and how much are you paying?",

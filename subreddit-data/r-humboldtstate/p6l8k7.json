    "postText": "Hi all, not sure how many of you are bakers or interested in baking, but I have a very active sourdough starter I'm maintaining here on campus and would love to share with other students. If you want some to start baking with yourself, comment or message me and I can let you know where I'm at and when I'm around so you can scoop some up. Just bring your own container.  \n\n\nI have 30 pounds of flour too so it's a near unlimited supply if I'm given enough notice to feed beforehand. It's very low maintenance and lives happily in my fridge for weeks at a time without feeding. Performs well after being woken up by feeding with any old flour and warm tap water 3-4 hours before you want to put it in your dough.",

If you've been to commencement you've probably seen PhDs ugly-crying in public because of all the work we've seen you put in. \n\nSo yeah, this is a challenge but we're working on it. \n\nExpect more info later this week about 'alternative graduation', but we are going to do our best to make sure that you, and your friends/family, honor your major accomplishment.",

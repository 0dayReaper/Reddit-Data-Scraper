That being said, it's more collaborative than competitive and people generally support each other. Can't speak to mechanical (starting fall '23) or whatever new degrees they'll be adding because they just put some of the new hires in teaching ERE stuff this semester.\n\nNow to answer your question, probably like a 3-3.25 fresh out of high school I'd think. You can start as a freshman taking Calc 1 but it isn't advisable to come in lower than that unless you want to spend more than 4 years here. That all may change over the years as the new programs become established/competitive?? \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

I can't imagine him being able to take precalc or Calc down the road...Anyway, it's all very helpful. Thanks!",

Often high school is not the environment for that. I know people who failed math classes in high school but ended up getting all the way through differential equations, linear algebra, and discreet in community college taught by former UC Berkeley professors with the same level of rigor. Consider concurrent enrollment at a community college if there are any math professors with good ratemyprofessors scores. That's what I did in high school and it worked very well for me. Ended up staying in community college after I graduated high school to get my lower divisions finished and transferred here, but that isn't necessary.",

Concurrent enrollment in a math class or two at community college, while he's still in high school, can be a great way to get a head start on math and build confidence with low stakes. If he fails the class or needs to drop out, then you just don't include that CC transcript on the application :P. Totally depends on his schedule of HS classes though, wouldn't recommend it if it seems like it's going to be too overscheduled.\n\nEdit: Okay upon further research, omitting a CC transcript from an application could potentially be risky if they find out. That being said, I know multiple people who have done it and nothing bad happened to them.",

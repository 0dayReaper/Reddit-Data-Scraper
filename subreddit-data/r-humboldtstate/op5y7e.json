If your major has a club, you can try joining to see how your peers like the program too. \n\nIf you\u2019re a science major, I would say HSU is prestigious enough, especially with their upcoming move to a polytech. \n\nHowever, if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be happy at HSU at all, then I would attend the school you think is the best for you.",

I didn't take any major classes at first, changed my major after the first year, and everything worked out great\n\nEdit: unless you're in engineering or some other crazy impacted major with tons of extra requirements",

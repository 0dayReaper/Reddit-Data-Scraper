    "postText": "Wildlife sophomore over here! I find myself struggling a bit in the Intro to Zoology course. I failed my lab practical. I enjoy it the material for the most part, but now that college is in person I am trying to find the study techniques best for me. I didnt need to do it much with online courses. There's lots of memorization and I have a terrible memory. Any tips or advice you use for your studying? Right now I am using a lot of Quizlet.",

I would have questions when I went to lecture. And, be there for office hours, every week. Show your face. Ask a question that your professor will explain at length. It makes them feel good! \u263a\ufe0f",

When he announced that the class got an average of 68 on the practical and said he expected that...I rolled my eyes and basically decided there's nothing I can do to get an A when I'm also in 5 other classes.\n\n\nHowever, after failing the practical, I started really really trying in lab. I take pictures of everything and add them to an app called notability, along with the lab hand outs. I go through the lab section by section and take notes and ask questions and label everything I see. Also, I decided to spend more time in the lab before the practical. \n\nThis class is really hard so don't feel too bad, just do your best. That practical was very hard.",

It had a very high fail rate when I took it, circa 1990.\n\nOld school here:  I used a multi-colored pen to take notes, so different anatomical concepts/structures had different colors.  After lecture, I'd recopy my notes, because I learn from repetition.  And then right before the test, I'd copy them again.  I also organized a study group, and we took turns explaining concepts to each other.  I would've had an A-, but I skipped one quiz to go mountain biking, and ended up with a B+.  Life Lessons.",

I don't exactly remember which course zoo 110 was, but I'd encourage you to find a method of training your brain to properly memorize stuff now. 300 level wildlife/zoo classes are absolutely brutal when it comes to memorization/identification. Classes like ornithology, mammology, herpetology, etc... All require you to identify species or (or genii, if you're lucky) on sight, and you're expected to know dozens, if not over a hundred or them, for each one of those classes.\n\n\nWriting out flashcards by myself, then going over them with a study partner or two worked great for me. Building the flash cards helps you review the info, and cements it in your brain. Going over them with a study buddy makes you explain what's on the cards, and maybe think about them in a slightly different or memorable way. Also everybody comes up with different rhymes and sayings to help them remember stuff. The stupider they sound when your friend tells them to you, the more likely you'll be to actually remember them.",

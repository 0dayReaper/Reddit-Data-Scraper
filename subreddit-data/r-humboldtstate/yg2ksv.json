Does anyone here have experience with STAT 109? \n\nI am curious how hard the class is and if I should wait to take it over the summer.\n\nThanks in advance!",

One of my classmates had a baby who sometimes came to class with us and Michelle was super cool about it and would even hold the baby while lecturing so the mom could catch a break and take notes :\u2019)",

Dude\u2019s a super sweet guy, but he was not blessed with good teaching ability :(\nAlways do your quiz preps, do not shirk any labs or homework, and absolutely do not miss a class. He gives y\u2019all the workbook for free, and the labs seem deceptively easy at first, they will get much harder as time goes on. I would advise against taking it over the summer.",

There\u2019s less development around there than in Arcata so there\u2019s more wildlife around campus - lots of deer, and my friend saw a bear in the woods right behind the school",

Definitely got the \"big fish in a little pond\" vibe, but really enjoyed it because of that. Classes were always small, teachers were easy to work with, resources were always made available to those who asked. I found it very easy to focus on school while going there. The downside to all of that was that it was boring as hell on campus and food options totally sucked. Not having a car for a few semesters there also was tricky as you really have to time out the bus schedule and spend hours of the day riding the bus depending on how far away home is. Hoping they address these issues with the expansion of new earthquake safe buildings and more places for students to hang out.",

I've absolutely loved my time at CR, and all of the forestry professors are kind and helpful with getting involved with various opportunities. There's a lot of cool events and a Forestry Club, and it's cheaper to attend here than Cal Poly initially. If you ever have any questions feel free to DM me!",

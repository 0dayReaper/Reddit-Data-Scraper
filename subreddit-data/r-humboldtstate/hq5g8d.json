This seems like a way for them to milk full tuition from the students without concern for the safety of said students. I know students that aren't taking shelter in place seriously now holding parties and such, what makes the administrators think they'll abide by the two-week quarantine before the in-school portion begins, when they're back with friends they haven't seen in 5 months? If even one person gets Covid on campus this coming semester it is wholly the responsibility of the administrators.",

    "postText": "I'm currently a Bio-Chem student at Humboldt State living on campus this semester and searching for housing up in Arcata starting during the summer. I am noticing that everything is either a house that would be perfect with a group of people (Which I lack since it's been impossible to coordinate with covid going on) or they're apartments that are entirely too expensive. Does anyone have any kind of input that would be helpful with this search? Or is anyone else up in Arcata right now that is in the same scenario as I am and is looking to move into a house?",

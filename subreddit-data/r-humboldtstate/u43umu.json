    "postText": "Does anyone know how the themed housing works at Humboldt? I know certain ones are major-based, and that others are more interest-based (gamers and anime lovers for Indoor Adventure, for example). I applied for and got into both Indoor Adventure and Outdoor Adventure and Recreation. However, I\u2019m worried about how strenuous some of the activities are (like\u2026 my ankles suck and I\u2019m constantly spraining them and I don\u2019t want to take someone out if the OAR decides that the community is going rock climbing and I can\u2019t opt-out). Does anyone have any knowledge on Indoor Adventure or Outdoor Adventure and Recreation?\n\nAlso, side question, but does Madrone (in Canyon) have a specific theme housing? I\u2019ve been checking my portal but there aren\u2019t any housing themes associated with it.",

There is an extra fee to live in Outdoor Adventure ($100) that goes toward the trips though, so that's something to consider. The Theme Housing, just helps bring residents together with similar interests, but in any of the communities it's up the resident how much they want to be involved. Madrone currently does not have any theme communities. Please email [housing@humboldt.edu](mailto:housing@humboldt.edu) if you have further questions.",

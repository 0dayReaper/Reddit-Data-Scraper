    "postText": "Hi there! My best friend and I are looking to move to Humboldt in June. The plan is to move off campus but we would like to have some more roomies so we can afford a larger place. We are both 21 years old and in our junior year. She\u2019s an education major and I\u2019m studying wildlife. We are searching for female roommates who are also at least 21 years of age. \n\nWe have posted on the roommate website for HSU but haven\u2019t had any luck. \n\nIf anyone is looking, please reach out! We would love to get to know you.",

I\u2019ve been looking into going there for a while and I want to become a teacher but I\u2019ve heard some negative things but I figured it\u2019d be extremely beneficial to hear from someone that\u2019s in the situation I\u2019d be in when I do transfer if I do choose Humboldt. Thank you so much",

I made an attempt to move home back in March, ironically the day california was first to declare shelter in place. I lasted 3 months before trotting back to nebraska to find work and get housing ASAP. I go to University Nebraska Omaha but I got into HSU and start in the fall, thank fucking god, I\u2019ll be turning 27 this august and I\u2019ll be transferring in as a junior to their cell/molec bio program. I will be in the housing/roommate market this summer! I\u2019m a cis bi female with an awesome little old 12 yo doggo.",

    "postText": "For some background, I'm currently attending Oregon State University, and I haven't been liking it very much. I was thinking about transferring back to CC near home, and then transferring to either Sacramento State or UC Davis. However, I have also been considering HSU, especially since they are becoming a new polytechnic school!\n\nSo, how is the CS program here? Will that new funding make the program really good, or is it going to be a long process that I probably won't see the improvements by the time I graduate in 2025?",

Half the professors suck, and the couple that don\u2019t tend to teach the intro courses, leaving the more complex material to be taught by professors who don\u2019t do their job adequately.",

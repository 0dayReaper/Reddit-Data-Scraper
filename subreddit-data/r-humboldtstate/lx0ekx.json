    "postText": "Hello all, I am a transfer student looking to move into the dorms (college creek sounds the best so far) fall 2021. I have lived in dorms before and found them not really my style, I dont do well in heavily monitored environments with a lot of rules. I guess I am looking for any input on what it is like to actually live there, what the culture is like, and if there is an oppressive authority presiding over the place. I am quiet and will be outside mostly, so it is my hope that i can just live and let live without being \"ruled\" too much.. also it would be great if I could bring my cat with me. Does anyone have experiences they would care to share?\n\nThanks!",

My roommates smoked weed, just have a fan and be careful with it and you'll be fine. I never filed or got a complaint and rarely saw the RA. My roommate had a little cat and everyone loved her, she did have to get ESA though. I recommend college creek for transfer student 100% its very much like an apartment, just slightly more controlled.",

They'll usually grant it if you have a history of mental illness that can be verified by a therapist. If they approve it it's a good idea to say you'll have a cat on your roommate profile in MyHousing, and check with potential roommates before finalizing who you're going to live with.",

If you\u2019re a transfer student, you might be worried about making friends or meeting new people but honestly you\u2019ll be fine considering most other transfers are living off campus and in my own experience, think that transfers that move onto campus are \u201cchildren that don\u2019t know how to be an adult\u201d. If you don\u2019t like rules, don\u2019t live in campus. \n\nTo the op: Also, before Covid, I had a 20 year old friend kicked out of school 2 months into attending. He lived on campus and he had two incidents of underage drinking and cops were called both times. HSU doesn\u2019t fuck around sometimes. \n\nIve been living on my own but my lease has been up and I\u2019m looking for a 2br to split with someone for next year or ASAP. If that\u2019s something you\u2019d be interested in, message me when you\u2019re in humboldt and we can set up a meeting and see if we\u2019re good. (I\u2019m a straight cis male, cool with living with anyone regardless of age, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, disability. I also have a cat, and I do smoke weed although almost never in my apartment)",

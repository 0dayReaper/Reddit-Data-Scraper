    "postText": "I'm in my first year of community college right now and I'm planning on transferring to Humboldt in the fall of 2023. I didn't do too great these first two semesters due to many personal reasons, so now my GPA is sitting at a sad 2.2. However, I plan on busting my ass my second year and hopefully getting a 4.0 in both semesters which I know I'm capable of. That should bring my GPA to around 3.1. I know that Humboldt accepts transfers with a minimum of a 2.0 GPA, but is a 3.0 GPA solid enough to where I'd get in for sure? Humboldt is my dream school and I've been looking forward to it for years, I really hope I didn't mess up my chances with this one shitty year.",

My GPA went up to like 3.2 or something. If you\u2019re determined then you can definitely reach that goal. HSU was my dream school too. Best of luck :)",

    "postText": "Hello!\nI'm starting HSU in January and I'm currently SOL at finding a pet friendly place. I currently live in Los Angeles which it makes it difficult to view apartments in person. I've already gotten rejected from a few places where the property managers didn't mention I wouldn't be considered if I didn't view in person... but they gladly took my money for the application. \ud83d\ude43\n\nI am looking for someone to view an apartment on Saturday at 6:30 pm. I can $50 for your time. I just need someone that can show up and  what's app video call me. (don't have iPhone so can't FaceTime.. sorry) \n\nI'll pay $25 before and the other $25 after. Please DM  me so we can do a video call to discuss details.\n\n\nThank y'all!",

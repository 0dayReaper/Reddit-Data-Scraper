Overall, I really enjoy the program because all the faculty members are so nice and helpful. I can send you more details about specific profs if ur curious. It's a great program to pair with another major or minor. A common minor to pair w CRGS is communications (my minor) or journalism. Ofc you don't have to have another major or minor, but it's a common occurrence. I think the program will be getting better, but rn I have enjoyed it for the most part. My criticisms are: we rly lack courses compared to STEM majors (pathways w # of classes ranked: 1. Ethnic Studies, 2. Women's Studies, Multicultural Queer Studies), I like how small the program is but others might not like that, ppl will always ask what ur gonna do w ur degree. The major is relatively new, so it still feels like we're establishing ourselves on campus &amp; in the world.",

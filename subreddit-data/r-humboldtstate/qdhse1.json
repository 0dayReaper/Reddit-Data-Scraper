    "postText": "I'm 45 years old and would like to graduate from Humboldt with a degree. My problem is I don't know where to start.\n\nI understand the HSU may go Polytechnic which sounds awesome. I have always been fond of physics and have a career in Information Technology. \n\nAny advice on a good starting point?",

Easy to get in, affordable for a state school, small class sizes, inclusive/laid-back atmosphere, and a pretty high ratio of non-traditional students as far as I remember.\n\nFor which program, I recommend thinking about what line of work you would want to use your degree in, and then work backwards from there.",

Look at the majors and minors, class descriptions, and reach out to office of admissions and find out if you are eligible.\n\nIf you are not in a good position to apply just yet then I would suggest attending a community college to do General Education classes and the base core classes for the major you\u2019ve selected then transfer. Use the website Assist.org to make sure you cover all the classes you need to transfer to HSU, so when the time comes to apply you\u2019ll almost have a guarantee of being accepted.",

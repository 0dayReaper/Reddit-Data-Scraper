            "comment": "There\u2019s a program here that allows students to take online courses at other CSUs called CSU Fully Online Program. I imagine they include any language courses that are offered online but I think it would be pretty rare for less common languages. Although after studying many languages, learning a language in person can\u2019t be beat. It would definitely be a great idea to take a snoop at it and see what you can find!\n\nI also see they\u2019re offering some night classes here for Japanese through Extended Education. $80 for a few weeks isn\u2019t bad at all. Japanese is easy and fun in the beginning but can get difficult when learning more complex syntax, grammar, vocabulary and kanji.\n\nTo be honest, taking Spanish would be advantageous because it can be found even all the way up here in NorCal, or even just the US in general because Spanish speakers can be found everywhere.",

Here\u2019s the link so you can take a look: https://extended.humboldt.edu/extended-education/course/japanese-language-session-2\n\nI took Japanese at community college before transferring here, although that was back in 2012-2014.\n\nThey do offer Spanish and Chinese as regular classes. You can also email the program and get more info from them by following the link provided by the official HSU account on their post and getting their contact info.",

I believe all of the instructors are native speakers, so there is that aspect of it.  It is one of those cases where I wish that CSU provided more funding for more classes because the instructors are so amazing and fun.  A lot of majors have elective units that you can take classes, like a second language, and have it count towards the degree.",

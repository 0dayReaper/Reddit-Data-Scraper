An easy going no judgement mentality is face value but there are hate speeches and hate crimes around and the administrators knows but does not care enough to take real action. \n\nThe class scheduling is stupid. Most classes you need usually would be 50 min a class for MWF. If you have a preconceived notion that you only need 3 semesters to graduate as an incoming transfer perhaps reevaluate cause for a lot of majors the classes are conflicting with each other. Also sucks for parking since Fridays are like a monday. Also no one knows how to shut up in the library. People literally talk with their stage voices in there. \n\nThose are some of the biggest things that erk me as a student, but other than that clubs are very inviting, free food, and most people are laid back.",

The vibes there are one of a kind, and you can have an absolutely wonderful time if you allow yourself to. I highly recommend getting involved in clubs, sports, or any extracurricular. Make friends, have fun, work hard, and above all else, dont stress when the going gets stressy. \n\nAlso! I'm going to go ahead and put in a good word for the ultimate frisbee teams, and the slack jacks (slacklining club). If those are your kinds of things, doooooo theeeeem!",

All dorms physically on campus will be underclassmen and 1st year transfers only. \n\nI would start planning for what you want to do early and best of luck.",

My understanding is that the housing will only allow them to offer a room to all freshmen, not others, so off campus will happen in year 2+ most likely even 2025+ You can also accept enrollment and do up to a year or so elsewhere at another CSU I think, though you should go over the classes and number of allowable credits carefully w/ an advisor. This could help some of you avoid the hassles,  both freshmen and older students (can study at another CSU up to a certain number of credits but still graduate from CPH). Parking is very tight, don\u2019t drive to campus if you can at all avoid it.\n\nhttps://csumb.edu/planning/take-course-another-csu/",

Probably because it'll make the numbers look really good for the university (sarcasm).\n\nAs a transfer, I definitely don't want to commute anymore. I did my time commuting for junior college, and I finally get to live on campus this spring- only to find that 'temporary' off campus housing may be the only option available to me and many others. How is this supposed to be our only option? This will just add onto the already prevalent struggle to find parking on campus. Yes I know they'll have a shuttle, but I doubt enough people will utilize it to alleviate the issue.",

If anyone gives you shit for being sober, they\u2019re not the kind of person you want to hang out with. \n\nI personally found it super easy to make friends as a transfer student living off campus. Even now that I\u2019ve graduated, I\u2019ll still meet and befriend HSU students at parties. I never joined a club either, but that\u2019s probably a great place to meet friends. Some of my friends met cool people through clubs.",

            "comment": "Tbh I was here for Covid and the school barely puts on social events now compared to before, so if you don\u2019t go to parties it might be pretty hard to make friends. Even now that we have in person classes its a bit harder to make classmate friends than it used to be. Also, if you come from a well-populated area, it\u2019s going to feel monumentally harder to find decent friends since this school\u2019s on the smaller side. As for the weed thing, I have yet to ever see anyone catch shit for not smoking. Even hardcore stoners don\u2019t judge you or anything for not smoking, although I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll offer at some point to be friendly.",

I would choose The Canyon or The Hill halls for that because they have many students per floor. The Canyon is better though because The Hill has massive hallways, so The Canyon is slightly more intimate and less overwhelming. Skip Cypress because it is more akin to apartment living and you've got fewer people in your immediate living space as friend material.\n\n2. Join [campus clubs](https://clubs.humboldt.edu/).\n\n&gt;I hear it\u2019s quite a green school, is my being sober potentially a problem?\n\nIn my era, smokers were the exception to the rule. I presume that has changed. Either way, your experience will be much easier if you have a tolerance for how people are different.\n\nIn terms of matching you into a hall with like-minded folks on smoking, be sure you specify on your paperwork you do not smoke and if there is a question indicating whether you tolerate drug use, state that you don't (even though you will). This may help your placement.\n\nHowever, in my era, pot smokers who didn't smoke tobacco products would list themselves as non-smokers on the registration paperwork. I wouldn't be surprised if that's still true, so you may be rooming near smokers despite your best efforts.",

My dream weekend is a blanket, hot cocoa, poetry, and video games lol. You'll at least make a friend or two in your major, and try and make at least an acquaintance in each class. You'll probably become decent friends with those that you live with. The biggest step to take is after you are done being in class. Text people and ask if they want to go on a hike, go to the farmers market on Saturday, or check out some of the local stuff. Seriously once you get a little gang of misfits, go take a day on the weekend to check out everything the plaza has to offer. \n\nFriends are kinda difficult to make if you get tunnel vision. Trust me, I am a senior and am graduating in 10 days, I spent a bit too much time in books and too little with friends. It is worth it to make friends even if it can be difficult. This is coming from someone who has never drank nor smoked, you'll be fine, just be you and you'll find people who like you.",

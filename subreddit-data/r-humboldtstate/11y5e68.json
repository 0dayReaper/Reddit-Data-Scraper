CSULB has a great program but can be heavy on petrology, I'm looking towards more environmental &amp; hydrology focus. Any tips, insight, or advice appreciated!",

It\u2019s a small department and everyone knows everyone, so you\u2019re not just a number, they truly care about you. 2 months after field camp I was hired by a county government water agency as a hydrologist. The name of Humboldt geology is well respected and will take you far after you graduate.",

I can\u2019t say enough great things about our department. As someone else said, it\u2019s a small department and the faculty really cares about you. It\u2019s a pretty young faculty and the professors are passionate about research and getting students involved in research, in my experience. There is a big focus on field trips and field experience. They do not currently have a hydrogeologist on the faculty but one professor is a glacial geologist that does research about water, sediment, and climate science. You\u2019ll definitely enjoy geomorphology! \n\nIn general, I think hydrology and, particularly river health, are a huge part of science and concern on the North Coast. There are a lot of opportunities working for parks and restoration councils. \n\nI am sure that you will have a great time at CSULB, if you decide to go in that direction, but Cal Poly Humboldt has a really close knit geology department. I think you could find a lot of avenues to explore your interests in hydrology and the environment in the area, in the department, and at CP Humboldt.",

I have a MS and a BS in environmental engineering, but I\u2019m also working towards a PG. I\u2019d say go to Humboldt for hydrology if that\u2019s what you are into, but I hope someone else chimes in that\u2019s a geology major.",

I'm definitely interested in hydrology, but feel likey may not know enough about it so could actually be interested in hydrogeology/hydrochemistry. Not sure if there's a difference there job wise though. Also, I was assuming a geology BS could land you a position as a hydrologist, is this common or is it generally engineering majors? \n\nAlso, what's being a hydrologist like??",

And being a hydrologist is the greatest job ever. It\u2019s my dream job. If you want more insight into what some of us do, you can dm me. I do a lot of GIS and Python programming for drinking water related projects.",

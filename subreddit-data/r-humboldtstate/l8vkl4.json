            "comment": "Homelessness among students was addressed with a hire of a housing liaison that serves as a point of contact between renters and would-be tenants. It helped a bit but it\u2019s still an issue since no one should be homeless for any reason other than choice but that\u2019s another convo I guess. \n\nThere are places to rent. Studios and one bedrooms are insane prices (~$750 /mo). I live in a 2 bedroom house with another 2 bedroom house attached and my roommate and I pay $675 each per month for rent. There\u2019s for sure cheaper places and there\u2019s more expensive places. You just have to do a lot of research and get lucky. \n\nThe campus is scheduled to be open for in person classes for Fall 2021 as far as I\u2019m aware. \n\nHumboldt is amazing if you like being outside. The night life is lacking. But, if you\u2019re more into a 5-10 person hangout than a big rager, you\u2019ll love it. The people in arcata are pretty great. It\u2019s a very community based town. There\u2019s farmers markets every Saturday (depending on season I think). There\u2019s the community park. There\u2019s a lot of student club activities too! \n\nIt\u2019s really easy to pick up a hobby here. There\u2019s skating and rollerblading communities, there\u2019s rafting, fishing, canoeing, disk golf, hiking, nature/landscape photography, mushroom hunting, cycling, astronomy (there\u2019s many dark sky locations very close to Humboldt) and there\u2019s tons more! I really love it here. I think you will too!",

I\u2019ve lived in other states as well. This is hands down my favorite. Compared to living in NY this is like Mr Rogers neighborhood. I can\u2019t say enough good things. \nThere are 2 bedroom co dos for 900 a month in decent places with decent neighbors. In Arcata. There are 2 bedroom apartments slightly less. Many homes have sort of legal dwellings on their property that they rent out. There are alternative living situations as well. \nMany of the houseless people here are that way by choice. They can be a bit sketchy but honestly the panhandlers are a bigger problem. Most of them have homes and do that instead of working or to pay for drugs. Some are honest about that. They can be anywhere from annoying to mildly aggressive. \nYes there are many hippy types. There\u2019s also veterans and a large variety of science types. And yes the marijuana crowd. Some areas have harder drug problems. The people arguing over opposing solutions to this are more annoying than the drug users. \nI feel safe having my kids here and want my grands here too. \nThere is a serious lack of diversity that is my biggest complaint. And the food. You can\u2019t get a proper hard roll or bagel anywhere. There\u2019s only a couple decent pizza places and no Jewish bakery or Italian deli or Greek diner like you\u2019d find every block in NY. But my husband says that the food is quite similar to that of Southern California but just less snobby. I only flew through there so i can\u2019t say. And no. There aren\u2019t a lot of big box stores, but don\u2019t we all mostly shop online now anyway?? \nFrom an older persons point of view, after taking classes there at HSU recently, the you g people in the classes were quite nice and well behaved. Or at least far better behaved than I was at that age. It seemed as if they were pretty accepting of each other\u2019s differences as well, even when they didn\u2019t necessarily mesh well with it. Like live and let live, rather than mean or bullying. From my perspective anyway.",

I\u2019ve heard from others that humboldt can be affordable which is great to hear. Also hearing about the lack of diversity is both hilarious and lame. I\u2019m Mexican so I can understand where you\u2019re coming from. Also the whole thing like worries me too- not in a serious way I\u2019ll just miss the diversity LA offers.

Peruse housing websites and Craigslist just to get an idea for your options.  Compared to OC though, housing prices are CHEAP AF.  Cheapest you can get along the CA coastline probs.  $1200 a month for a decent 2 bedroom apartment, and $500-600 for a room generally.\n\nIf homelessness is higher at this college than elsewhere (the differencewould be negligible), it is likely because of three reasons.  1.) This area is poor in general, so locals may sustain homelessness in order to be able to afford going to college.  2.) HSU is the best option for someone who is impoverished and wants to go to college because it's one of the most affordable 4 year university in the entire country, so it may be the only one someone who is that low can afford.  3.) Humboldt draws a lot of hippyish crowds, so that may just be a choice.  I know tons of people around here who have at least thought about it, and my friends and I have separately made serious plans to buy a van and live in it fulltime.",

            "comment": "I moved to Humboldt almost a year ago for a job, not for school, but I also came from Orange County (Irvine). Humboldt is definitely different- goods and services are limited in quantity, quality and variety up here. Partially because we\u2019re located about 3-4 hours from the next nearest cities, but also because it\u2019s an economically depressed county in general. There\u2019s not really an industrial tax base, and some communities (like Arcata) are against corporations coming in and investing in the community. But I digress. \n\nHousing is one of those resources that\u2019s generally lacking. There\u2019s certainly none of the \u201cresort style\u201d apartments you see in Orange County with in-unit laundry, fitness centers, pools, tennis courts, etc. Many older apartments and homes have mold issues from the cool, damp weather that is far more common here than in SoCal, and that *will* eventually affect your health. Parking is also an issue, with very few apartments having secured parking in the form of fencing or a garage. It is not uncommon at all for cars to be broken into, so be sure you don\u2019t leave anything in your car that could tempt an opportunistic thief. \n\nAlso, while rent is definitely cheaper than in most of Orange County, you are generally paying a lot for what you\u2019re actually getting. For example, my security deposit in Humboldt was three times what I paid when I was in Irvine, because (I\u2019m told) people here like to tear up apartments and turn them into illegal marijuana grows, and a high security deposit apparently dissuades people from doing so. Also, as with any college town, the closer you are to campus, the more expensive the real estate. Living a bit further out in Eureka or McKinleyville will give you more options and a wider price range, but then you have to deal with driving to campus and finding parking. \n\nAs others have stated, pets are generally frowned upon in rental properties, although cats are far more likely to be accepted than a dog. Still, a cat will limit your choices somewhat. \n\nAs for finding roommates, I had some pretty good replies by simply posting on Craigslist. The college might also have a program for matching people with potential roommates. \n\nBest of luck to you in your housing search and your academic pursuits.",

When the In-N-Out opened in Eureka about 6 months ago, it was a big deal and people had plenty of good and bad things to say about it. That\u2019s just one example to give you some perspective. \n\nAlso, since you mentioned pre-existing medical issues, be forewarned that healthcare in Humboldt county is generally shit. There are 4 small hospitals that provide basic services, but good luck trying to see a specialist or finding your personal GP. It is not uncommon for people to drive down to Santa Rosa or over to Redding for healthcare services (both are about a 3 hour drive away, so a simple appointment is an all-day affair). As an economically depressed county, it\u2019s hard for professional services to retain skilled individuals. Doctors, nurses, lawyers, law enforcement, teachers, etc. have pretty bad retention. Many come to Humboldt fresh out of school, build up a couple years experience, and then move to bigger cities where they can make a lot more money. \n\nAs for the crime, it is certainly common up here, far more so than where I lived in Orange County, but generally speaking if you take some common sense precautions and mind your own business, it\u2019s not a problem. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, there are positives about Humboldt too, which most people are quick to talk about. I just wish people a had been a bit more balanced and straight forward about the negatives when I was moving up here.",

It sounds like they don't very much like living here. It also sounds like they haven't explored or searched anything out or left their comfort zone very much. Humboldt is not for everyone. Let me address his main points.\n\nGoods and services are limited compared to the broad scope of ever-present things in the OC. Sure, you don't have a Del Taco or Bowl of Heaven in every cookie cutter strip mall, but you do have unique and local products that fulfill your needs. There is nothing you can't get here in high quality. There is more selection of high quality things in OC, but there is nothing lacking up here in Humboldt. In addition, it's not economically depressed. It is very rich, but not in the way that OC is. I believe that is his point. \n\nHousing will be easily found, and you shouldn't worry if you have money. Cat housing will be easier to find. My car has never been broken into, and I have only heard of one break-in among my friends in the last five years at least. I've been here for ten. It is a safe place. Still, don't leave anything of value in your car anywhere. Finally, no, it doesn't have the insane apartments that this guy describes. Thank god.\n\nAs for apartments being turned into 'illegal marijuana grows'...just no...that doesn't happen now that cannabis is legal. Sure there are grow houses or scenes that people grow in the house or garage, but they're well managed and aren't in torn up college apartments. Not a source of crime.\n\nLive in Arcata if you want good culture. Live in McKinleyville if you want cheaper rent. \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions. Humboldt is amazing, lovely, and I will never go back to OC. If you like the forest, dislike Southern California culture, and enjoy living in a beautiful community near the beach, then come on up!!",

It sounds like they don't very much like living here. It also sounds like they haven't explored or searched anything out or left their comfort zone very much. Humboldt is not for everyone.\n\nThat's pretty presumptuous of you to state. I'm simply trying to give her a balanced outlook of life in Humboldt- something I wasn't given before moving here. As I said, there are plenty who are quick to talk about the good things Humboldt has to offer: the natural beauty, outdoor activities, lack of traffic, etc. and I don't disagree with most of those things, but it's also not the land of milk and honey some make it out to be. Using her current home in Orange county as a frame of reference seemed like the best way to convey that information.\n\n\\&gt;In addition, it's not economically depressed. It is very rich, but not in the way that OC is. I believe that is his point.\n\nIt is economically depressed. That may not necessarily be a high priority for a college student, but it does relate to opportunities and resources available, such as healthcare. Orange county ranks in the top 10 of all 58 CA counties in per capita income, per household income and per family income, with a population more than double the next largest county ranked higher on the lists. Humboldt is in the bottom 15 counties across all three metrics. A drive through downtown Eureka reflects that- shuttered business after shuttered business. The Bayshore Mall is half empty. HSU itself has suffered from budget cuts and falling enrollment. And there most definitely is a problem retaining professionals in a variety of fields, mostly due to low pay. Yes, there is some money, but it seems to be concentrated in a relatively small percentage of the population.\n\n\\&gt;As for apartments being turned into 'illegal marijuana grows'...just no...that doesn't happen now that cannabis is legal. Sure there are grow houses or scenes that people grow in the house or garage, but they're well managed and aren't in torn up college apartments. Not a source of crime.\n\nIt may not happen anymore, but the effects are still present (e.g. - very high security deposits). When I was looking for a place, almost every property management firm and landlord had very strict \"No smoking or growing\" policies, violation of which were grounds to have your lease terminated. Real or perceived, it's something an aspiring tenant ought to be prepared for.\n\nAs you said, Humboldt isn't for everyone, and a lot of that depends on where people are in life. A 18-24  year old college student is going to have a different outlook and priorities than a 30-35 year old professional. Political ideology, lifestyle, academic interests, hobbies, etc. will all factor into her choice, which is ultimately hers to make. But based on my personal experience, a lot of issues tend to get sugar-coated or overlooked by people who like living in Humboldt. That's to be expected, but don't disparage someone for offering an alternate perspective.",

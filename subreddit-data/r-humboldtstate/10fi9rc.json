    "postText": "There was a 4th year Cal Poly Humboldt student named Camile who was killed in Arcata on Alliance Road while walking with a friend and dog yesterday. Camile's dog also died, and the other victim went to the hospital. I wanted to share a link to Camile's GoFundMe in case anyone here would like to contribute to it or share it on social media or elsewhere. I have confirmed that this GFM page is legit (with Camile's brother, ref: Redheaded Blackbelt via Fb), and that the funds raised will go to the family to help pay for Camile's burial. \n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/camiles-burial-expenses?utm_campaign=m_pd+share-sheet&amp;utm_content=undefined&amp;utm_medium=copy_link_all&amp;utm_source=customer&amp;utm_term=undefined\n\nHere is a link to the story on Fb:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/1588398434708137/posts/pfbid03598Mc1R5mx3y2QVhadsxwaTUzjYkDkq1YnoNNFj976tcZJFz3njuH5KLxnT7bTrRl/?mibextid=Nif5oz\n\nHere is a publicly-shareable Fb post with the GFM link:\n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid0KvYAwbe1GV9xeLKzroucAvVxDaCuXcu64xDHpjoBJvDWuBYtY8UayDWEtgZjHvKGl&amp;id=1003567003&amp;mibextid=Nif5oz",

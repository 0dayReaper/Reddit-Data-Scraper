I don't know if any populations that are currently threatened from people picking it, though there could be potential if it grows in popularity. If you want to find it's natural range, you can look it up on cal Flora or iNaturalist. I would just enjoy it in your home and not buy anymore.",

Kumeyaay people come to mind but there are others.\n\n On Instagram there's an account called kumeyaaydefenseagainstthewall that has information about donation opportunities. Try contacting them and they will probably help you figure out where to send the sage",

Given the current global setting and the reality that indigenous communities are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 it might take some time to return the sage. You should reach out to the indigenous groups near campus (there\u2019s a few) and ask them how they recommend you go about this process. \nHere\u2019s a link to help you locate indigenous territories you could reach out to: [who\u2019s land am I on ](https://native-land.ca)\nBest of luck!",

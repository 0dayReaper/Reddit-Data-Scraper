    "postText": "I'm a second bacc student probably moving up with my partner next year. We're in our 30's - just wondering if there's anything approximating family housing, or what kind of resources might be available to us besides dormitory-style housing, if any, thru HSU. Last time I chatted with an admin, they gave us a few references but nothing has materialized. Craigslist, etc., is yielding no straightforward results either. Any advice at all on this subject would be awesome. We're thinking about renting some land and putting a trailer on it at this point... thanks.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I will probably be transferring for film as a sophomore next fall. The film major description says you are encouraged to minor in something you care about. It says something in the sciences or social sciences gives you broader depth. I\u2019m thinking of getting a minor in each area. For science I\u2019m going to do zoology. However I\u2019m not sure what social science minor I should go for. I\u2019ve never really been a history fan but I care about social justice, racial and gender equality, and the education of our youth. What are the best minors out there for these interests? What did you minor in? How was the subject and what was the most interesting part, the most fun part, and the hardest part about it? TIA!!!!",

Social studies have issues but sociology is one of the few that has even more. You could also look into gender studies too, but it\u2019s going to have the same issues. Start by taking sociology classes and exploring the catalogue, just be wary.",

I mean if the main point is to be more aware of the social justice issues around you, that\u2019s not hard to just do on your own to become more \u201cwoke\u201d you just need the right sources. I\u2019m also looking into the social advocacy minor, but I\u2019ll look more into sociology classes as well",

The point of the field is to put out research that is scientific though. It is the best place to look for sources. Just make sure you are evaluating the studies effectiveness.",

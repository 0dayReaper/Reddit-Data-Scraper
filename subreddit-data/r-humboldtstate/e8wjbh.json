Most other Cal States won't give decisions until Jan/Feb/Mar.\n\nNot that it's not a great school, it's just behind the Redwood Curtain, and that's not appealing to everyone.",

So after you log into your HSU portal, in the middle there should be a column called \"steps to enrollment\" that has options like \"Applying for financial aid\" and \"Accept Admission offer by My 1\". Click the accept admission button and it will take you to a page with red text on top called \"Oracle\". In either of the search bars, search for \"Admission\", and it will pop up 2 or 3 options. Click the one called \"Accept Admission\", confirm that you want to accept it, and Voil\u00e0! Hope this was helpful, and congrats on conditional admission :)",

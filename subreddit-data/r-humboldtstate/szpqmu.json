If you're interested in having an old timer hop in to your gc for occasional advice feel free to dm me. I'm a native that left after graduating from the nursing program and now live in Boston. I'll help in any way I can including access to local resources and finding housing.\n\nPro tips: get your weed from dispensaries, keep your stuff locked up, don't rent in pneumonia gulch, and learn to survive the hippies. Wild berries and the co-op will be good to you. \n\nBest of luck to all of you and don't forget to keep in touch with your families. \ud83d\ude09",

                            "comment": "Getting involved is inevitable! Arcata is such a small town that simply attending HSU (CPH?) shoves you straight into the culture. \"Downtown\" (ie: the plaza) is about a two minute bike ride from campus. Five minutes if you're a slow walker. \nActivism, including community activism, is a particularly resonant aspect of Arcata and Humboldt.  Festivals and farmers markets will keep you connected to the local community.\nThere is a lot of home pride in the local art scenes across the board. Take your time to enjoy what Humboldt has to offer. \nIncredibly unique geography leads to an amazing experience for the outdoorsy types but don't go wandering into the hills by yourself (it is not safe). Take your hoodies with you, tho- you're going to need to bundle up fairly often (especially if you're from SoCal). \nNerds/geeks like myself are not rare but, as you might guess, you're going to have to look a little harder (resist the urge to look in your neighbor's windows) to find them. \nHumboldt will welcome you.  A little respect and kindness goes a long way.  If townies get worked up just be patient with them. They'll probably soften up after a bowl.",

            "comment": "It's pretty common to feel this way when you come to a new school. And even though you aren't new. Coming back to school after so long almost feels like it (at least for me).\n\nIt's very easy for us to absolutely convince ourselves that people don't like us even when it's not the case. Every little thing they do has us thinking it's a slight or something, but in reality, no one thinks about us as much as we think about ourselves, and they're not slighting us or anything. This has been a big problem for me specially which is why I mentioned it here.  \n\nI would also suggest to maybe dive into some extra-curriculars. Do some clubs in (or out of) your major, maybe try a recreational sport if you're sporty. Because of the volume of people you'll meet, you're bound to meet a friend or two. \n\nAlso going to sports games or bars to meet people in real-life could also lead to a friendship or two. \n\nVolunteering is also a way to meet people. I met some of my best friends through my volunteer time at the annex.\n\nAlso, if you're feeling in a bad place and need some support. HSU has CAPS and it's honestly amazing to talk to people there.",

Lay off the JRE and JBP, become a bit more open-minded to liberal values (we have them, I can assure you), and don't assume you are owed anything by anyone - be it friendship, affection, or more.  Do a bit of soul-searching: are you really charismatic, or just repeating lines you picked up from others to make yourself feel charismatic?  Is your \"charisma\" coming from knocking others down or lifting others up?\n\nStart listening with an open mind, rather than while formulating your snappy comeback.\n\nStart putting effort into your relationships with other humans (not just romantic relationships, but friendships, collegiality, group work, etc.) in a generally selfless way: not based on what you think you can get out of them later, but what they can benefit from having you around.  No, it doesn't mean become a doormat, but it does mean to leave the calculations at home.\n\nGood luck, man.  It looks like you can actually still get the college experience you deserve and need - one that is truly formative for you.",

I'm a gun nerd, I practice martial arts as a hobby, and I have very strong moral/political values that tend to be more center-right, so whenever I get deep into conversation with anyone from the college, it usually ends with them saying something like \"well you've got some stuff about you that needs to change,\" as though they're the arbiters of my beliefs. I try to be open minded, understand where people are coming from, but in an environment where everyone is telling YOU to be different, while also being stuck in their ways, it gets very fuckin stupid very fuckin fast.",

Then my first friend at hsu started spreading around to our neighboring suites that I was calling her names and then said I was calling others names and she slept with the guy I was dating so honestly yeah I feel this because I have no friends and it sucks and I see everyone else hanging out and being buddy buddy but I\u2019m by myself with my cat",

If anyone on this subreddit is flying home to SD/LA that day and would be willing to carpool I can pitch in for gas. Also open to anyone in the area who may be willing to drive me there, and I can reimburse you for gas then as well. I know there's ubers/lyfts in the area but they are also scarce.",

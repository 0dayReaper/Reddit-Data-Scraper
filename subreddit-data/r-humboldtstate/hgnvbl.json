    "postText": "Hello. I am an incoming transfer and I wanted to know if there were good or just a good amount of vegan options on or off campus? I visited the town awhile ago and I saw a few vegan options but to be honest I wasn\u2019t there for long enough to really know the town. If anyone has information on vegan options or advice on how to live on campus as a vegan that would be very helpful (advice like: should I bring food from home, stuff to shop for at the stores there, etc)\nThank you!",

There's local groups and a club on campus for vegans! There's quite a few options at the local grocery stores and coop as well as the farmer's market in town.",

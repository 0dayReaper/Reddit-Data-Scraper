    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am a newly admitted freshman already committed to HSU in the fall. My friends and I that have also committed have created this server for new freshmen admits going into the fall semester of 2021. This server is specifically open to any freshman who is entering college out of high school who is committed or considering committing to Humboldt State. The purpose is to link new students together in hopes of making friends or discussing things about Humboldt, majors, and anything in general.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested in joining the HSU Discord server, please click this link below:\n\n[HSU Freshmen 2025](https://discord.gg/SFhFgtXcaH)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are having trouble accessing the server, or have additional questions, you are welcome to send me a message. Also, feel free to share the link!",

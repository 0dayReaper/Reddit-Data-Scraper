If your room gets sun, then close your curtains during that period. A desk fan to circulate air also helps.\n\nBack in the day, there was a thermostat in the hallway that was routinely abused. The thermostat cover could be removed and a folded scrap of paper placed between the metal contacts to prevent the heater from turning on. And maybe in cold residence halls the paper was removed and the plastic cover super glued on by unknown assailants.",

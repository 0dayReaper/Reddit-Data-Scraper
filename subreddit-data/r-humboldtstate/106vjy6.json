The remainder of the program will be online.\n\nIt's designed to be doable by students who are already working locally as nurses, hence the emphasis on online courses and a couple weekends in-person.\n\n[source](https://catalog.humboldt.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=8&amp;poid=3380&amp;returnto=1352)",

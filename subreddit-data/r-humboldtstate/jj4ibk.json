The campus and surrounding area is beautiful and there\u2019s a lot to do, provided that you like the outdoors. No regrets.",

The way the clouds werenoverhead, the waves were crashing, and there was a guy filming a music video on his keyboard at the end of the jetty.  It's breathtaking everywhere around here to me. I'm doing business so the program doesn't really matter, every school is the same in that dept, so it was really choosing where I wanted to live for the next 4 years.  And yeah I never want to go back to my hometown.  I call Humboldt home now.",

I moved up here never having seen the place or visited once. And it was the best decision I ever made. \n\nSo much more was waiting here for me than I could have imagined. The close knit and caring community. The enchanting natural beauty. The slower pace of a small town on the coast. I could sing Humboldt's praises all day and night. I never looked back and have been here for almost 7 years now. I fell *in love*. Not everything is perfect here, far from it in fact. But its as close to perfect as you can get (in this reality and on this planet) for me at this point in my life.\n\nI've since graduated, then applied again for a masters, which I am almost finished with. I will be looking for a job in the area and will only leave reluctantly if there is absolutely no work here for me (which isn't the case luckily).",

He wanted to move up here so I convinced myself to love this place (otherwise I probably would have ended up at UCLA or a community college).

I made some amazing friends, I\u2019ve been happier than I have been in a very long time. I ended up switching majors and overall life goals and I met the most amazing person in the universe who I am marrying at the beginning of best year. I wouldn\u2019t change any of it for the world.",

I have no regrets in choosing Humboldt but I have reached the point where I wish I was in a larger city simply because it feels so isolated, especially living in Arcata. Overall my experience has been good but I do look forward to eventually moving to a new city.",

I\u2019m not an outdoorsy person at all, but something about the trees and the clouds did it for me. I was going for business administration and they sweetened the deal with their \u201c5 year MBA\u201d program. 4 years undergrad and then 1 year (3 semesters) graduate. Was stoked for that and did my time. By the time I got to junior year, I started to talk to professors who all said to not do the masters there. I was confused, but even the professors teaching the masters classes were advising against it. Their reasons were somewhat solid, so I ended up just getting my bachelors. \n\nSometimes I wish I\u2019d gone to a bigger school, but for what it was, I had a good time.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I recently transferred to ASU Spring of 2021 but was enrolled and attended HSU from 2019 till then. When I transferred my credits got messed up so I am now returning to finish one of my degrees in the fall. I am a 22 male (23 by move in) looking to live off campus for the year. If you are looking for a roommate (looking to move in about may) with a budget of 1300 a month, please lmk!\n\nThanks \nJared",

We are buying a house and most likely renting out the extra room. If you\u2019re interested DM me we are very chill down to earth, and very accepting and unjudgmental. We love to have a good time and are very funny.",

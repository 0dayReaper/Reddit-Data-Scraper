    "postText": "The double sided tape I have really ripped off some paint in my dorm (Canyon, Alder). Does housing actually care about these multiple 3-4 inch spots of ripped off paint or am I going to have to cough up $75 for repainting?\n\nUpdate: I just went to Hensel\u2019s Hardware and they\u2019re matching the exact color for the walls in Canyon (Alder). They don\u2019t do sample tins for this one, so if anyone\u2019s interested in buying the quart off me after I use it, please send me a dm!",

Picked up paint chip sample cards and am leaving the art major to decide on the proper color. Ace has paint sample squeeze bottles available for cheaper. Those are located at the back wall.\n\nBTW, the uni uses different white paint colors in different dorms according to the cards I went through.",

I got charged for tape or tack holes, and in the prep information for leaving the residence halls, Housing stated it would look at that level of detail. \n\nI mean, someone is going to be doing some paint repair before the next tenant moves in. If it's Housing, they'll charge you for it. Imagine what the residence halls would look like after a few years if these repairs were not done.",

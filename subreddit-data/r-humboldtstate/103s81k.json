A little about me: I'm majoring in Environmental Science and planning to continue with that field at Humboldt. I'm Latinx and was wondering if any other Latinx people \\[from SoCal\\] could tell me about their experience at the university and in the surrounding area? I would really appreciate any little tidbits of info!",

Immediately I found other socal Latin people to have carne asada with and to play Latin music with. \n\nThe issue is the representation in teachers for the Latin community. There is plenty of stories of micro aggressions taken on people of color and definitely many are true stories. I haven\u2019t found that staff are purposely racist but they do have to be checked and reminded on how to be an ally. \n\nOther than that, I\u2019m enjoying my time as a Latino male here. We need more of our people here in order to help grow diversity in the communities. This is a great place to get involved in learning and sharing the idea of breaking bread with others. Most people fall in love with the place and never want to leave. I\u2019m definitely falling in love with the town.",

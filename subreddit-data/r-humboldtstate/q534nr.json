    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm a 21 m potential Junior transfer, and  I'm looking for advice on if the school is a good choice. I am majoring in Critical Race, Gender, and Sexuality studies, with a minor in journalism. I don't mind the small-town vibes or more so the isolation of the county from everywhere else, but I have heard from other threads that police are a real issue here. Is this true?\n\nAs for housing, I'm planning on applying for the campus apartments in the 21+ themed housing. I'm also looking on craigslist for off-campus places (hoping it would be cheaper) but haven't seen anything besides a posts few and far between. People who don't live on campus, how did you arrange this? People, who do, did it benefit your experience at all? \n\nI'm also big on being social, and heard unless you meet the \"right people\" it's mainly hanging out with friends day drinking. I'm not opposed to anything that would come my way, but a lot of posts are from years prior and was wondering about the current situation. Is it a popular thing for friends to get together and make a day trip of going to Oregon or San Francisco (I'm aware it's a bit away lol). What is or was your Humboldt experience, and if you were a transfer how easily was the acclimation to campus for you? Thanks in advance :-)",

            "comment": "There was just a Clubs Fair this past week and HSU removed their limit of 20 people for an event, so I think we are going to see a lot more in-person club gatherings soon. There are clubs covering so many topics that I\u2019d be really surprised if none of them stood out to you. Many of the Sports Clubs don\u2019t require previous experience, like Cheer, Ultimate, and the Marching Lumberjacks (off the top of my head). \n\nI personally don\u2019t go out much, but I\u2019m involved in some groups on campus. A lot of my classmates and friends go hiking in the surrounding area. \n\nI was a transfer and lived in the 21+ community in College Creek (I believe that\u2019s what you meant since it\u2019s the only 21+ community in the residence halls). College Creek is hard to get into because it\u2019s so sought after. Follow the advice of u/NiktoriaNo, and jump on applying ASAP. \n\nI still live on campus and I like it. It\u2019s a great way to meet people. Pre-COVID, there were a lot of Residence Life events to meet people and hang out. Hopefully more of those will come back in Spring. I\u2019m not in a community-based residence hall, so all my housemates have different majors from me and are different ages. To be fair, I\u2019m a liberal arts major, and the majority here are science majors. \n\nI can\u2019t speak about your major or minor, but I suggest talking to anyone from The Lumberjack since I think most of them are journalism majors/minors. Regarding the police\u2026 I\u2019m in indoor cat so what I hear is second-second-hand information. I\u2019m also white, so I can\u2019t really speak on the topic. There\u2019s a few IG\u2019s that are centered around defunding/getting rid of University Police (UPD), so perhaps you can message them and ask for opinions. You can also message any of the multicultural centers on campus to see what their thoughts are on the matter. They\u2019d likely be more in the know.\n\nEdit: links\n\n[Asian, Desi, and Pacific Islander Collective](https://instagram.com/hsu_adpic)\n\n[Black Humboldt](https://instagram.com/blackhumboldt)\n\n[Critical Race, Gender, and Sexuality Studies](https://instagram.com/hsucrgs)\n\n\n[Diverse Male Scholars](https://instagram.com/dmsi.humboldt)\n\n[Eric Rofes Center](https://instagram.com/erc_hsu)\n\n[The Lumberjack](https://instagram.com/hsulumberjack)\n\n[Social Justice, Equity, and Inclusion Center](https://instagram.com/hsu_sjeic)\n\n\n[Students for Quality Education](https://instagram.com/hsu.sqe)\n\n[Students Without Borders](https://instagram.com/swb_hsu)\n\n[Umoja Center](https://instagram.com/umojahsu)",

            "comment": "Oh campus housing, at least in college creek, is easy, especially if you have in person classes or work on campus. The issue with spring transfer is you\u2019re gonna find most of the rooms are already full on campus. If you want on campus you need to apply as soon as you can in the housing portal, or you won\u2019t have a shot in hell. As for off campus housing, I\u2019d say check out the off campus housing coordinator. Her info is on the website. Socially, especially with covid, meeting people is hard. I transferred last year and managed to make friends by working on campus, and aside from suggesting the same, I can\u2019t offer much on that front.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a second year and I know that the 21+ housing is pretty full otherwise I\u2019d be there. Im in cypress unfortunately I wanted college creek but it\u2019s okay! I think it\u2019s pretty easy to meet people if your not to busy working full time which is how I was at first the only people I really knew were people in my dorm but now I know a bunch of more people since I actually started getting out! Housing off campus impossible wouldn\u2019t even bother until you meet people you personally know and they are looking for a roommate just because every housing situation I\u2019ve been in or friends that was off campus either had crazy roommates or the housing market is just crap because there\u2019s no housing available it\u2019s why homelessness is a choice a here that alot of people choose also what police? Honestly I\u2019d more worry about police in souther humboldt about 2 hrs from here police here are not that bad mostly I\u2019ve just never heard anything about them I\u2019ve always heard about the town above us being racist but never heard anything about the police here besides the fact that UPD doesn\u2019t do anything when you report things to do with other students",

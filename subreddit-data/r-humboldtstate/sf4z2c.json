    "postText": "So those living in College Creek, Creekview, or Campus Apartments (the three on-campus housing solutions that don\u2019t require an all-access plan) will usually opt in for any of the three Lumberjack meal plans:\n\nLumberjack 180 (180 J meals, 400 Flex Dollars, 45 Meal Exchanges, 3 guest meals)\nSemester cost: $2,100\n\nLumberjack 125 (125 J meals, 525 Flex Dollars, 31 Meal Exchanges, 3 guest meals)\nSemester cost: $1,750\n\nLumberjack 75 (75 J meals, 325 Flex Dollars, 19 meal exchanges). \nSemester cost: 1,050\n\nAll residential meal plans expire at the end of the Spring semester, on May 14, 2022 at noon.\n\nSo\u2026 the Lumberjack 125 does have 55 fewer meals at the J, BUT it also gives you $125 more in Flex Dollars. Let\u2019s say you pay $10 per meal with Flex. That comes down to 220 total meals for the L-180, or 178 total meals for the L-125. The $350 you save easily make up for it since if you like cooking even a little bit, you can make a lot more than 42 meals for $350. Maybe that\u2019s just me though?\n\nIn any case housing cashier said as long as you send the email today they\u2019ll honor it.",

These are also what you use to print on campus and to pay for laundry. \n\nMeal Exchange: the majority of your meals on a meal plan will be eaten at The J by swiping your card. ME allows you to go to other dining locations and get a meal equivalent to a swipe. Each dining location has their own meals that they consider equivalent to a normal meal swipe. The Depot, Bigfoot Burger, and the Marketplace each have combos that include an entree, a side, and a drink.",

Memberships do give discounts, but unlike other stores that is not the primary purpose. When you spend $25 on a membership, you are investing in the Co-op and thus get shares and a say in how the organization is run. As the organization is run by the community items sold are often local much like a farmers market; smaller volume goods are often more expensive. \n\nI can\u2019t put an exact number on how much I save for having a membership, I just know that it pays for itself and then some, but I go there a fair amount.",

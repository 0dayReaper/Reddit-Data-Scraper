I know one peer who medically can\u2019t get vaccinated due to their autoimmune disorder. I\u2019m not speaking in defense for all of them. I personally am vaccinated and advocate for it.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m more shocked at the percentage of staff that aren\u2019t vaccinated than student wise. That caught me a bit off guard",

Still, that tells you that there are a number of students taking classes on campus that are not fully vaccinated. I'm curious how many of those are single-dose though.",

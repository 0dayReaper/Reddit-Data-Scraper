Has anyone done this and can vouch for it being a fun idea? Where did you end up going?\n\nBtw I\u2019m actually not planning to use the degree for anything other than to have a degree and fluency in a language (or two). I\u2019m going to be attending a software dev bootcamp at CSULB and just wanted to use my financial aid to get a separate degree. Figured I might as well learn a language or two while I\u2019m at it!",

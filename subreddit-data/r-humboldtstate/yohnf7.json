    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m currently in CC fulfilling my pre-reqs to hopefully transfer to Humboldt into the Forestry program, with a concentration in Forest Restoration, by fall of 2024. I know I\u2019m not transferring for awhile, but I was curious to know how competitive and impacted the program typically is? I know Humboldt is one of the few schools in California to offer this program, so I was curious to know what to expect/if my grades will be good enough to be accepted. Thanks!",

HSUs social sciences are trash, they don\u2019t have many classes. Look at the class catalogs of uc Merced and HSU to compare, maybe it\u2019s different with psych. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re white-passing, that\u2019s good, if you\u2019re not, you\u2019re gonna experience racism directed at you. No matter what race you are, you\u2019ll hear a white guy (and occasionally white girl) say the n-word at more than half the parties you go to. \n\nAs for the financial aspect, the low cost of tuition is a big plus. \n\nNot much to do in humboldt unless you love nature and the outdoors, and if you do, you will love it here. There\u2019s so many places to explore and trails to hike and beaches to visit. Concerts? Raves? Basically Nonexistent. Also, apparently a lot of places don\u2019t let you in until you\u2019re 21 so you\u2019ll only be able to drink at your or a friends place.",

All of my non-white friends have experienced racism directed at them multiple times in the past 3 years. I went to willow creek last year in September and the cashier at the grocery store refused to check me out. When I told him fine, I\u2019m walking out with it, he threatened to go to his truck and shoot me.\n\nSounds a lot like you\u2019re a white dude that minimizes racist experiences to the point where your own wife doesn\u2019t feel comfortable talking to you about it. I have good white friends, but I rarely tell them about small little things that happen all the time, because they brush it off like it\u2019s no big deal, and I\u2019m used to it at this point that it\u2019s not a big deal to me.

I got two tickets in a week because i had mine in the upper corner of my windshield (they say to put it in the lower corner, but i didn't think it mattered). I got the tickets reversed but it was still a hassle",

So, back in the day, the university used to hand out a clear plastic square punched with a hole punch and a string so students could hang their parking pass from their rear view mirror. It made swapping a pass between cars easy. These days you're not legally supposed to hang anything from the mirror.\n\nMy point is... when you buy the pass, ask whether it must be attached to the windshield, or if it can sit on your dashboard below where it would have been applied to your windshield. If it doesn't matter, than find a piece of thin plastic or whatever to apply the decal to and swap that thing between cars without having to peel it off and reapply it each time.",

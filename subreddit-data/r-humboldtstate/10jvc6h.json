Like transferring here was a mistake after all the effort I put in. I've tried to talk to people but some of these groups aren't my style whatsoever. They've just been literal groups of furries. &amp; It seems like everyone already has friend groups already and I just keep making acquaintances but no real friends.  I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore.",

At that point, I just decided to be a dog &amp; shoot my shot with as many girls as I fancied before leaving. No regrets, cool school, nice campus, but completely anti-social &amp; self absorbed students.",

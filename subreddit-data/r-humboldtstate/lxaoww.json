            "comment": "You can\u2019t go wrong with Northtown coffee because it\u2019s a classic for arcata. Cafe Brio is also pretty awesome if your looking for a more European style cafe. There also a few good ones in old town eureka too like Los bagels and Old Town coffee and Chocolates \n\nCafe Mokka is an absolute must it\u2019s cash only, they have great coffee and they have private hot tubs and saunas that are available for reservations. I really hope this place opens up soon, as of right now they are temporarily closed. \n\nFor restaurants\nHey Juan\u2019s because they offer vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options it\u2019s great food at a great price. \n\nRita\u2019s is also really good. \n\nIf your feeling EXTRA fancy and want to celebrate and spend some money the check out Camp Ground for great steaks.\n\nJaphys, sushi spot and Pho Hoang are also some of my go to places as well. \n\nI hope this helps.",

There's lots of tea options as well, but is usually (non-covid times) very busy and hard to find a seat.\n\nCafe Mokka has great coffee and an amazing ambiance, including a large outdoor space, but no wifi and currently closed during covid. When it is open, they are also the Finnish Country Sauna &amp; Tubs which is amazingly relaxing.\n\nMosgo's Coffee House is my current favorite though. Lots of seating, good specials, and right next to Murphy's if you want to get something else to snack on while working.",

A few good places not a lot of ppl talk about are Sushi Tao, Tandoori Bites, and Obento ( a bit of money but soo worth it). Some solid cheaper choices tho are Hey Juan\u2019s, Arcata Pizza Deli, Rita\u2019s, Los Bagels, and Dons Donuts. There\u2019s also a few of my honorable mentions like Rico\u2019s Tacos, Blondies, and The Coup (truck)!",

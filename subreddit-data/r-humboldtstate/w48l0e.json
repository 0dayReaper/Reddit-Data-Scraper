    "postText": "Hey guys, so I know I\u2019ve been asking so many questions about moving in but I\u2019ve recently gotten some news about my moms health, that really make it hard to move 9 hours away from home, especially when it\u2019s just her &amp; I at home. I\u2019ve  already signed up for classes &amp; been assigned a dorm, haven\u2019t payed anything yet but wondering if anyone has ever appealed to their housing &amp; meal plan &amp; basically \u201cdropped out\u201d before the semester began, and how that process went for them?\nAlso* the day to appeal the housing agreement just passed 5 days ago but obviously I wasn\u2019t expecting this, but the website says a penalty charge will occur for everyday after that date, does anyone know that cost?",

I did graduate on a technicality because an employee misspoke and the administration felt bound to it. But it definitely was a special circumstance, so the possibility could be out there\u2026 good luck",

I\u2019m not sure the fee for a late housing withdrawal, can\u2019t find on the website. You can withdraw from housing now-August 15 and will only be charged the daily fee but if you wait until after the 15th you will be charged for the entire year\u2019s housing even if you do not attend or live in dorms. You can still drop all of your classes before August 21 and you will only be charged $27 for admin fees though so that\u2019s a plus.",

The deposit will just be added to your yearly fees, I did not pay mine on the spot either (I don\u2019t think anyone really did)",

You can cancel by emailing [housing@humboldt.edu](mailto:housing@humboldt.edu).  You can contact the Registrar to see what steps you need to take, but you're well before the deadline to withdraw [https://registrar.humboldt.edu/withdrawal-process](https://registrar.humboldt.edu/withdrawal-process). (We have not required an application fee or deposit for the last few years).",

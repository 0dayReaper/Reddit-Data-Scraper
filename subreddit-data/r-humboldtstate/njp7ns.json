    "postText": "I know the jackpass can get you around town for free but I'm wondering if there's reliable or at least semi-reliable lyft service. I'm mostly asking because I'll be flying in as I live in LA and don't know how to drive (yet) and may not be a licensed driver to rent a car. This is of course under the hopes that you can actually land in ACV that day and I don't end up stranded in some other airport without any other method of transportation to get on campus. So if everything goes well and I am able to land in ACV is there Lyft or some other taxi service that can get me to HSU?",

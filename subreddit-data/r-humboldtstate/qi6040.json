Those in charge are probably not going to check where each person lives that you're standing next to during a fire alarm. Even if they did know, you're setting a public example of non-compliance that encourages other people to not comply. This, again, draws back to elementary school behavior.\n\nYou were warned. Full stop. After you received the warning, you are on notice that if you do it again, there will be repercussions. You have yourself to blame. That's how I see it.",

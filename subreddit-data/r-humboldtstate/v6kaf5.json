    "postText": "Not really a question i just thought it was kinda funny, so i\u2019m an incoming transfer in the fall and I got into housing. My friends that have been to college said they had all messaged their roommates and got to know them beforehand so I figured that\u2019s what I should do. So I messaged my future roommate just saying hi and asked to get to know them a little before moving in, I gave them my instagram and they kinda just said no (respectfully) and basically said they\u2019ll meet me when they meet me lmao now i\u2019m nervous to message my other roommates rip",

Wait until August to message when room assignments are more final",

I think you got an outlier roomie who\u2019s just better at face-to-face communication. Definitely don\u2019t be nervous to message your other roommates",

I am the youngest in the apartment so i think that it may also be a factor in this situation?? I\u2019m not too sure lmao",

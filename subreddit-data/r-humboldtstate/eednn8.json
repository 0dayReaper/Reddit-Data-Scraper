The department is actually adding some nice stuff right now, and there\u2019s lots and lots of opportunities since humboldt county has a lot of traditional media. You can be a part of the school magazine, two school newspapers, and the student run radio station! The classes are pretty interesting, the radio teacher is really welcoming. lmk if you have more questions :)",

If you're looking for a modern, data-driven approach to 'content' for the digital world, you're going to have to find it on your own, but it isn't here, to the best of my knowledge. \n\nHSU does attract some very high caliber faculty, but you'll have to do your own research to find out who they are and if they meet what you're looking for. Across the board, in almost every department, I've found a lecturer I would consider to be world-class in the depth of their knowledge and how they present the material. Fundamentally, I don't know if education can deliver on the promise of a career in a field, as opposed to exposing you to a broad range of thinking, so I would recommend you focus on Media Studies vs any sort of Content Production.",

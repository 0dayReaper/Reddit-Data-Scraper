    "postText": "Today CSU's announced that select campuses will be providing iPads, keyboards, and apple pens for new first years and transfer students. Humboldt is included in this list and the deadline to sign up for one is August 27th. These are free so long as you are a student of the campus and will not impact financial aid, but will be returned after you graduate.\n\nedit: I don't know how links work so here it is [https://its.humboldt.edu/csuccess](https://its.humboldt.edu/csuccess)",

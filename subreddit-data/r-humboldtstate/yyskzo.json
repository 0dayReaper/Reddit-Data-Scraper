(I have an AA from a community college and am looking to transfer)\n\nSo far, just from looking at the required upper division courses, I can see that the Ecology concentration has more units required, but the classes are largely the same, can anyone help me?",

            "comment": "I downloaded a pdf that compares the two on one page when I started, and I cant find it on the website anymore but I still have it if you want a copy. Assuming its all the same requirements as now, here are the differences that I can tell:\n\nThe conservation biology concentration requires calculus, genetics, and organic chemistry, whereas the management one does not. You also would have to take the plant ecology lab, whereas in the management concentration only the lecture is required.\n\nThe management one requires that you take three management courses (one habitat course and two critters courses), and the con bio one requires one critters course and one habitat course.\n\nAdditionally for the management concentration, one of the following (herpetology, invert zoology, or fish biology) is  required. In the con bio concentration, you could take one of those if you wanted to, but you have other elective options (more stats or GIS mostly)\n\nI was told by my advisor that it doesn't matter which one I  chose, and that eventually the school is going to merge them into one option. But i have also heard that if you want to go to grad school, having the o chem/genetics/calculus could be advantageous.\n\nEdit: I uploaded the pdf I have to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R1HLsgeNTQHL8xpsAV7oC48Tl4OTr3kM/view?usp=sharing) for you. Definitely double check it against whatever you have looked at to make sure the requirements match, and then what I would do (what I did) was highlight the classes that I need/am interested in taking and then make your decision based on that. Looking at [course descriptions](https://catalog.humboldt.edu/content.php?catoid=5&amp;navoid=285) is also helpful",

Those concentrations are basically the same, in fact my advisor said that ideally one day they would combine them.\n\nBoth concentrations start out the same, but the conversation biology/applied vertebrate ecology concentration includes some harder science classes and calculus. I believe its only three classes apart for the other one. My advisor said the main reason to go for this one was that it looked better for Grad school.\n\nI recommend picking wildlife management and then trying out two semesters of science courses. If its a breeze, chat with your advisor about switching concentrations and go for it if you want to do grad school after.",

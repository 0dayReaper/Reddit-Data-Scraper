    "postText": "It looks like a poorly put on phone screen protector.  Does anyone know whether it's poorly done window art or cheap film on the windows?  Without knowing the name of the building, you probably know which one I'm talking about.  I've always wondered what kind of massivr oversight that was.  Nobody could think it looks good right?",

            "comment": "It\u2019s not for aesthetic. It was a project meant to be an insulator and it probably keeps the heat in too well. It gets really hot in that building. They\u2019re actually double pane windows so if I remember correctly there isn\u2019t a way to open the windows to the outside when it\u2019s boiling in there. I could be wrong because it\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve been in there. All my professors I\u2019ve had classes with in there said it was a failed project. They may take it down at some point",

It will not be coming down as far as I know. They just live with it because there are so many other things that are higher priority on an already strained budget.",

I was also confused by this when I came to HSU, but you may want to double check your room assignment and update this post for clarity :)\n\nRegardless of which building you're in, I'm pretty sure that all on-campus housing includes a desk in each bedroom for each student, and I would urge you against bringing your own (even if yours is better) because you probably won't be able to get the campus-provided one removed and you'll end up with two desks cluttering your space",

Definitely more like a mini apartment than an old-school college dorm, so you get a small kitchen/living room area, plus individual bathrooms for every two bedrooms. Still a small space but a lot better than the dorms where you have one locker room-style bathroom for 50 freshmen lol",

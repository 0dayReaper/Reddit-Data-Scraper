On the [getting connected](https://housing.humboldt.edu/resnet/getting-connected) page it says \"The ResNet Help Desk recommends CAT 6 patch cables.\" but I'm not sure if that's just a minimum recommendation.",

I thought it was just my long ass cord that's getting old, but maybe the campus wired infrastructure is just outdated. I might be better off just buying a wifi adapter for my rig",

            "comment": "Alright after buying a Cat7 Ethernet cord and seeing no speed improvement (wired speed tests are showing half the download rate of wireless) I finally emailed ITs directly and asked about it. This was their response:\n\n\"The ethernet in college creek is rated at 100mb, while it might be slower than wifi your connection will be much less prone to interference that wifi connections often have.\"\n\n...\n\n\"the wired network was installed when WIFI was just at 10mb and sometime 54Mb.  So at that time it was faster,  but less folks use it now, so that hardware is less likely to get upgraded.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe wireless access points located within the living room of college creek apartments also have the ethernet ports disabled, so you can't wire into those to bypass the outdated networking cables in the walls. Which I can understand why, it would be a safety hazard to have students running ethernet across the floor in a high-traffic shared space.  \n\n\nAnyway, just wanted to give people a heads up so they can save their money. The best download speeds would probably come from a really good wifi card if your room gets a good signal.",

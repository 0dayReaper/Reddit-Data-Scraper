    "postText": "Hello everyone! \n\nI recently transferred to HSU for the fall semester, and I'm looking to get involved with or create an informal martial arts group, as I've yet to find any on or off campus that don't cost money. My background is in boxing, muay thai, and judo, as well as HEMA swordsmanship (Historical European Martial Arts) and Kendo. Obviously finding people with experience would make things more interesting, but I'm more than happy to teach new people what I know, though bear in mind that I have no formal certification, as much of my training has been informal, and I'm not marketing myself as some martial arts master, just a hobbyist who would like to shake off the cobwebs! \n\nAnd for anyone who may be wondering, I have asked around about starting an official martial arts club on campus, and the general consensus is that, given its inherent risk of injury, it would be practically impossible. That being said, please thoroughly consider that risk before reaching out to me, I'd rather not have a lawsuit on hands lol\n\nIf you've made it this far in the post and are interested in this, please reach out to me and we'll work something out!",

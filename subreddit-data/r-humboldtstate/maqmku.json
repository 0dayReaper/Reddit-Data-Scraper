I\u2019m also wondering how it\u2019s been with covid, and what practice/performances will look like next year. Thank you for any/all input! I look forward to marching with you!",

As soon as we are allowed to meet in person, we will go back to our normally-scheduled gigs (as safely as we can). We have a few parades each in the fall and the spring, and we play at all home basketball games. \n\nDuring COVID, we are still meeting during our normal rehearsal time and hang out on Zoom. We have also been making compilation videos for the parades we would have been at this year.  \n\nFeel free to message me if you have any more questions, or you can contact our secretary. All her info is on the interest form.",

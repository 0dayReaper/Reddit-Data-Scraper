But I think it\u2019s very inclusive if you\u2019re vegan or vegetarian regarding the cafeteria food that is offered. I only remember the food being good the first week. I would suggest looking into a meal plan that fits with where you\u2019re living (ex. Dorms or off campus). As a freshman with the 7-day unlimited meal swipe plan I personally think it\u2019s a lot for a semester; but I also see some people run out of meal swipes two months into the semester so I recommend keeping that in mind.",

It depends on whos in the kitchen and if they are fully staffed because i've had amazing meals along with horrible meals, it all just depends. \n\nThere are soda dispensers but they are often non-functional/out of syrup but i stick to water so that never bothered me.\n\nThe hours can be annoying depending on your schedule, i found myself getting numerous ozzie boxes and keepting them in my fridge for when i actually wanted to eat.\n\nSalad bar is great, the strawberries are always amazing.",

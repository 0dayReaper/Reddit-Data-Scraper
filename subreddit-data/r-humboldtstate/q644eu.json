Iv'e eaten at every \"\"Mexican\"\" place here in Northern Humboldt and couldn't find a single one that compared to SoCal in the slightest. The best I've found that is worth my time and money or I would actually say is comparable to a degree is a place called, \"LaCosta\" and it's in Fortuna. Order well ahead because it's busy. Ask for extra salsa because it's great and they know it so they only give you a little and if you want more than 3 small containers they will want to sell you a cup of it instead.\n\n Extra bit of advice: When it's busy like on a Friday evening or weekend, try calling way way ahead of time because you are likely to hit a busy signal and have to call again for easily 20 min of repetitive calls before getting through. I've even given up before. (Over an hour of calling and not getting through)\n\nGood luck and enjoy the food.",

Small menu but people seem pumped on it. \nIf anyone gets to Fortuna, El Paisano in the Starbucks strip mall, I\u2019ve been once and had a torta and 2 tacos and it was super good, generous portion.

I\u2019ve been watching my partner who\u2019s attending a UC struggle to connect with his teachers and it really makes me grateful for HSU\u2019s professors being so accessible to me.",

One downside to small class sizes sometimes is its hard to get into your upper division major classes since they wont open up a lot of sections. Life science programs are also amazing!",

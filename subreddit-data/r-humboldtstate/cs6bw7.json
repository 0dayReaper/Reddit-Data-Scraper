    "postText": "A little advice from someone whose lived here for 6 years. (Alumni)\n\nOn campus, make sure to buy things with C-Points/ J-Points bc you get a slight discount on purchases. It\u2019s also how you pay to use the printers around campus so always keep some $ on your card.\n\nThe only Mexican food worth eating at is Valley Azteca off Giuntolli, or the Taco trucks.\n\nThe population is overwhelmingly white and it takes a bit to get used to, but there is some diversity around and it\u2019s growing in the population. \n\nBuy a nice rain jacket, bc you\u2019ll be wearing it a lot, as well as a good pair of shoes that won\u2019t get your feet wet. Chucks are ok, for the most part, but often lead to soggy feet when it rains and the puddles get deep. Docs or Chelsea boots are popular. Wool socks are the best. \n\nToni\u2019s (open 24h) is good, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but often a long line/ wait for food. I call in, place my order then wait 15-20 before driving 10 min to pick it up. Like a down home Denny\u2019s but slower. \n\nTbh. The Country Store off Giuntolli is the best place to get breakfast, but they\u2019re closed on Sundays. \n\nArcata is incredibly overpriced. Both in their housing, as well as the shops on the plaza. They prey on the idea of college students spending their parents money and don\u2019t give a damn what affordable means. \n\nMcKinleyville isn\u2019t as racist as people from Arcata make it seem. It\u2019s actually a really nice place to live as long as you don\u2019t live in some neighborhoods. \n\nEureka is a cheap and sometimes nice place to live but you have to deal with a lot of junkies that are like the walking dead. Basically, if you\u2019re anywhere near broadway/101, it\u2019s not gonna be the best place to live. \n\nGet a REALLY good bike lock. Any bike left unattended and improperly locked WILL be stolen. My sisters bike was stolen from her work, mine from my backyard. \n\nDo not assume bc it\u2019s an idealistic college town that a meth addict won\u2019t jack your shit. Don\u2019t keep valuables in your car at home overnight, or while parked at the beach or a trailhead bc it will get gone through. \n\nPeople have no sympathy for victims of theft. In fact, it\u2019s considered your fault for not tweaker proofing your valuables. (I know from experience, \u201cWell why didn\u2019t you X, so they wouldn\u2019t take your stuff? Like, it\u2019s not the tweaker\u2019s fault they\u2019re thieves)\n\nDO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES GIVE MONEY TO THE HOMELESS. They prey on liberal guilt. Maybe a sandwich or a blessing bag if you REALLY want to help. \n\nWe have the highest rate of vehicular manslaughter in the state. Do not think you\u2019re safe riding your bike. Do not think you\u2019re safe walking on the sidewalk. Many people have been mowed over in both circumstances by drunk drivers. Look up the tragic case of Marci Kitchen and realize drunk driving murderers do escape justice here. \n\nBe careful walking around places with a lot of shrubbery as there is most likely someone living in that bush. \u201cExploring\u201d trails will often lead you to a pile of trash where someone either once lived, or is currently living. \n\nThe Hammond Trail from Arcata to Clam Beach is a really nice place to ride a bike, as are the trails in the Arcata community forest. \n\nDon\u2019t go into the community forest too early (before 11a) bc you will disturb the homeless. \n\nThe water at Clam Beach is highly polluted from feces runoff, as well as the river that runs through Moonstone Beach. You may get pink eye, or worse. \n\nWillow Creek is a great place to find a hot place to play in the water but be aware that the Trinity River claims the lives of multiple people every year, especially in early/mid spring. Don\u2019t be that guy. \n\nAlso RESPECT the ocean. Be aware that a sneaker wave can come up exceptionally farther than the cycle of waves before it, it will knock you off your feet and drag you into the ocean to drown. If your dog gets pulled in, let them swim back on their own. Your life is not worth it to save your dog. A whole family perished this way, and in the end, the dog and the daughter that didn\u2019t go in the water were the only ones to survive after Bro, Dad and Mom all drowned trying to save their dog. \n\nOr just, don\u2019t get a dog as a student. Please. So many students walk around campus with their \u201cemotional support dogs\u201d and it\u2019s gets fucking old. It\u2019s harder to find housing with a pet, let alone more than one pet. No one will rent to you or will charge hella $$$ extra in deposits/monthly rent. Humboldt is not as pet friendly as most assume when coming up here, especially in Arcata. Also, don\u2019t be the asshole in the library yelling at your dog for crying about having to take a shit because you\u2019re working on a paper. Their farting and stinking up the library that has no windows is not cute, and you\u2019re a shit dog owner. Focus on getting your own life in order before taking on the responsibility of another being. Students have been homeless because they don\u2019t want to give up their pets. \n\nDon\u2019t bother with any property management company as they are expensive, and are difficult to get a house through. They\u2019re slum lords as well. \n\nDon\u2019t get a job as a trimmer. It\u2019s nearly slave labor that highly underpaid. If you know a guy who needs help during the season, sure, but dont take a job with someone you don\u2019t know personally. Get a real job instead. You don\u2019t want to get trapped in the industry through complacency. \n\nAlso, students, the locals most likely, really don\u2019t like you. There is really a lot of resentment going on up here. It\u2019s not in your face, but you\u2019ll notice it in comments some locals make. They see it as outsiders coming up here, taking up all the housing with their parent\u2019s money, making it hard for them to find reasonable housing. And most jobs are underpaid here bc they figure a college student is temporary anyways, making it difficult for non-students to get a well paying job. \n\nLast but not least, remember Arcata and below is Wiyot territory. Trinidad and above is Yurok. Respect the local native population and their right to their land and culture. Don\u2019t fuck around on Strawberry Rock, it\u2019s seen as being very disrespectful to a sacred place. Some fishing holes are also seen as belonging to local native families, so you may get run off your fishing spot. Don\u2019t be a racist ass about it.",

            "comment": "To anyone reading this thread, it's actually okay advice. It's not 100% accurate, and some claims are a little exaggerated, but they're sentiments you should keep in mind. One of those 'expect the unexpected kind of deals'. Think the worst so you don't get caught off guard. \n\nBest advice on here though. . . The Mexican food in Arcata is TRASH. It's literally the first thing I do when I get back to San Diego because I miss it so bad. \n\nAnother good piece of advice is don't get a trim job. There is a lot of history of abuse and mistreatment of workers. And seriously, unless you REALLY know someone, don't go trim for them.\n\nThe beaches here are not good for swimming. Scary water, bad time. Never turn your back on it. I agree with OP.",

It\u2019s a big adjustment for some people. I lived in the IE before moving here, and I experienced homelessness and theft but never to this extent. Maybe it\u2019s more in our face because it\u2019s a rural area with only a few city centers. Also, I grew up going to all the beaches in SoCal, and going on many vacations to the east coast, Hawaii and Mexico. The beaches here are a whole other monster here. And, if anyone has suggestions for Mexican food that I should know about, I\u2019m open to suggestions as I haven\u2019t experienced all Eureka has to offer.",

You at least offered an honest opinion on pretty much everything one could think of on the spot. I've definitely given less detailed accounts of the area to people considering Humboldt as their school. \n\nI might add the rain to your list. This one seems obvious to you and I, who've spent +5 years living here. But there are some SoCal kids coming to Humboldt who don't know REAL rain. Not that drizzle that shuts down the 15 and 405. We're talking rain that shears highways from the very mountain sides. Rain that starts December and doesn't stop til April. It's hurts your soul. You will find yourself depressed in the winter and not know why. It's just the sun, it's not there for a good part of the year. \n\nAnother question I see from incoming students is about the party scene. I've never seen a truly complete answer I don't think. I'd like to see an answer that covers drinking culture vs smoking culture, types of parties, the family neighborhoods that have parties that get rolled by police, the bars on the square, other drugs like Molly, cocaine and hallucinagenics, lack of frats and frat houses, party's amongst clubs holiday celebration and the Uber availability. All these points could have multiple different things said about them. I have to admit, I'm not the right person to discuss them all, but to get a good idea of the \"party scene\" in Humboldt, I think you'd have to look into each idea and see how they play with each other in a small town. \n\nI really like your list though, I think incoming freshman and transfer students could get a good idea of some of the opinions held on important issues in the area.",

            "comment": "I haven't had bad Mexican food in Arcata.\n\nToni's is a cross between fast food, Denny's, and a trucker stop. If that's your thing, more power to you.\n\nDo you have a source for your highest-in-the-state vehicular manslaughter claim? I would not classify the amount as \"many people.\" I say that as someone who knows a woman who was intentionally run over in this county. I have a healthy concern about personal safety when on a bike or sidewalk, but no more than in any other place I've lived. As for Marci Kitchen, you may wish she is spending more time behind bars, but her sentence is [8 years in prison](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2018/sep/18/marci-kitchen-sentenced/), which isn't 'escaping justice.'\n\nProperty management companies are not slum lords. You've classified an entire category of regulated business in a derogatory manner. Students have their opinions about good and bad management companies. As a student, I only had good experiences with management companies and bad experiences with independent homeowners (I moved/upgraded to a better apartment each year as I began to understand what was available from seeing friend's apartments). Management companies are more likely to be familiar with tenant law and their legal obligations.\n\nIf by liberal guilt you mean humanity, yes, panhandlers use a person's sense of wanting/needing to help your fellow humans as a way to get donations. Students are an easier target because freshmen may have little or no prior experience with panhandlers. [Food for People](https://www.foodforpeople.org/donate-food-or-funds), the food bank for Humboldt County, is a good place to donate if a person wants to help the homeless and other people experiencing food insecurity. A simple, polite \"Sorry\" suffices in turning down a panhandler.\n\nUndertow and sneaker waves are an issue on any beach, but a few local beaches are especially dangerous and have signage to that effect. Don't ignore such a sign. Undertow is what killed the family you referenced. My wife knew the family. Basically, don't turn your back on the ocean.\n\nRegarding card points, keep in mind how much you're spending in real dollars.\n\nHaving a pet does indeed complicate finding an apartment. Comfort animals are not service animals with protections via the Americans with Disabilities Act. \n\nClam Beach's pollution source is being researched, but preliminary suspicion points to bird poop. ([Source](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2018/jun/22/county-health-department-develops-poop-test-figure/)).  Generally, the beach has a poor grade when dry and a good grade when wet. ([Source](https://beachreportcard.org/40.987639/-124.121466/14/539))\n\nTourist locations and beach parking lots are targets for smash-and-grab vehicle break-ins. Do not leave a purse, backpack, bag, box or anything else that looks like it might contain something of interest within view in your car. Put it in the trunk, before you park.\n\nI've not heard of anyone laying claim to a public fishing spot. If someone confronts you, makes you feel uncomfortable, and threatens you if you don't leave in a place you have a right to be, call the sheriff's office, or 911 if it's an emergency. I've only had good experiences with local Native people. They're utterly regular people like everyone else. My kids have friends who are Native. There are cultural sensitivities you may not be familiar with, but it's unlikely to come up in a casual encounter. \n\n&gt; the locals most likely, really don\u2019t like you. \n\nThe above statement is mostly baloney. Where such resentment exists, it's mostly limited to extreme right wing viewpoints on contentious ballot issues in Arcata where there's a fear the student vote will sway the outcome against them. It's mostly limited to anonymous Internet forums, and only one such vote in the past 30 years comes to mind (the 62% vote to remove the President McKinley statue from the town square). Arcata is an exceedingly liberal/progressive city even without HSU students. And on the statue issue, the city council had already voted 4-to-1 for statue removal, so the public vote confirmed the sentiment of the city council.",

That means cultural experiences, vitality among local businesses (students do spend money, ya know?) and when you graduate, some of you enter our local workforce in jobs that require advanced education and training. It's hard to recruit employees from out-of-the-area, and HSU's presence is largely appreciated except, possibly, among a minuscule number of small-minded anonymous keyboard warriors. There's probably a ton of other benefits I'm forgetting, such as the large amount of volunteering students do in the community.",

The person I knew who was the most resentful of outsiders was a Hillary supporting male feminist. I don\u2019t think he was swayed over fear of his vote being diluted by college students. He just blamed them on his inability to find a place to live. And I honestly didn\u2019t mention anything about the political differences, or the McK statue so idk where that even came from. \n\nI am SoCal Native. I was a member of ITEPP and met other Local Natives who talked about how there are fishing spots on the Klamath reserved for families and you have to get their permission prior to fishing there. That is a fact. My roommate was also an avid fisherman and was angry and racist against the natives for chasing him from his fishing spots on multiple occasions. I had to do a lot to explain to him the cultural sensitivity of their perspective so he wasn\u2019t such a judgy racist douche about it. We\u2019ve met many Wiyot, Yurok and Klamath people, while living and have had good relations with them.  \n\nIt is known to the people in McK that the manure runoff and unmaintained septic systems have polluted the Mad River that feeds into Clam. \n\nA sneaker wave grabbed an 8yo  girl off of the beach at Big Lagoon, and I should mention that all kids should wear life vests while out on the beach, especially while playing on the spit. Not to mention, a student last year was fishing in Eureka and was taken in by a sneaker wave and they never found his body. It happens. It\u2019s not only undertows to worry about, and the signs are not apparent on the beaches like they are in other places, like Hawaii. \n\nIdk where your from, or what your background is, but I\u2019m also Mexican and from SoCal, so I have standards with my food. Maybe your taste in Mexican food is shit. The salsa is mild at best without flavor, their rice is soggy and without flavor as well. Making rice orange does not make it Mexican rice. Carmella\u2019s and Rita\u2019s are sub par. The only one kinda worth while is Luzmillas. \n\nThe Journal did a whole editorial warning about vehicular manslaughter long before Marci Kitchen, and yes, the fact that she got only 8 years after murdering two girls while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a crime is a fucking embarrassment. That is not justice. It also took like 2 years to even get her behind bars while she flew back and forth to Mexico on vacation awaiting trial. There was also a case of a drunk driver inMcKinleyville wrapping a teen girl around his truck tire while she was walking home with her friends. They were on the sidewalk. He drove his truck onto the sidewalk and struck her. \n\nIn my post I was just answering some of the questions I see frequently asked about this area, by college freshmen or transfer students, as well as adding in some that I was blissfully unaware of when I moved here.",

It would seem from that chart that much of the problem is in Eureka.\n\nThere are surely problem areas in the county, but I suspect Arcata is pretty low on the list with its nearly city-wide 25 mph speed limit and extensive work done in the past decade to promote bicycle and pedestrian safety... redesigning streets and intersections in the process.\n\n&gt; doesn\u2019t invalidate the things I\u2019ve heard \n\nMy advice to freshmen is to expect the best from people and they will probably get it. If a student comes from a different cultural situation than they find on campus or in Arcata, look into the MultiCultural Center, HSU's other cultural centers, campus clubs, and so forth to find people who share their experience.",

You can choose what seat, additional baggage, and checked bag for an additional fee. So you can get a flight for $19 and that is just your flight ticket and one personal carry on. Avelo has a few different flight options out of Burbank.  Arcata being one of them.",

Amtrak is required to offer busses only in conjunction with trains, so sometimes they'll route you on a train for like a minute, but on a bus for most of the trip.   I've taken Amtrak up and down California a lot so feel free to ask if you have questions.  They recently changed their website and made it a whole lot worse imho.",

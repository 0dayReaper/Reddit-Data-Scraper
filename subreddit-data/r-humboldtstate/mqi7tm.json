    "postText": "Guys, what the literal heck. It is already April and I still have no admission update. What in the world did I do wrong? I emailed the head of the department twice and she said I would know in a week or two...last week. I have anxiety issues and this whole admission process has been horrible. It was much easier to deal with getting put on the waitlist at SDSU than it has been to wait to find out if I am going to be accepted or rejected to a school with a 92% acceptance rate. I really like HSU, the program, the idea of it, but I am really feeling discouraged. I mean, I have to commit to a school by May 1st. I am starting to think about going on ahead and sending my intent to register with Chico State. I feel discouraged guys. Did any of you have this much trouble when you got accepted? When did you all find out. Is it worth toughing out the long decision making process? Should I keep emailing them? They don't answer the phones,  as the offices are closed due to Covid-19. Is the program really great for Social Work? It looks and sounds wonderful, but this whole process really has me wondering how much stress is worth it when there are two other fine institutions who are happy to teach me. Thanks for coming to my whiny, pity party, need encouragement TED talk.",

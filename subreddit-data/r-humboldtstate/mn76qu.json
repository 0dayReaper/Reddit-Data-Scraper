    "postText": "Hello, I am looking into taking MATH 105 Bio Calculus this Fall as a freshman Fisheries major. Any feedback on the course or instructors? Was the material manageable? I am currently taking Pre-Calculus (high school level) would this class be a stretch or would College Algebra and Trig be a better fit? Thanks.",

    "postText": "As everyone who does on-campus housing know that when applying for housing there is a on-campus housing agreement with rules and including where there\u2019s a move in day and move out day dates.\n\nI was wondering from those with experience what has happened before with Freshmen moving out of campus housing? Like does anyone know from experience if some stayed close by and did rent till a new school year began? Because I have heard that there are people from Los Angeles or somewhere further that moved up to northern Cali but was wondering how did they handle.",

Rent a storage space from a storage company and move back home for the summer without your stuff.\n\n3. Move home for the summer and bring your stuff with you.\n\nIn my time, it was customary for parents to drop off and pick up their kids with all their gear at the start and end of the year. And yes, if that meant a 12-hour drive to San Diego, that's what ya did.",

Also, focus on finding a job before the end of the Spring Semester and you will need a Co-Signer for almost any Apartment you apply to. Staying in the Dorms is an option in some cases to international students, but it is not guaranteed, plus the living expense for the summer in the dorms would easily be double what you would pay in rent and bills for the same time.",

It\u2019s not hard because during the summer a lot of retail stores lose all those previous employees because people graduate so it\u2019s easier to get a job what do you need to know? It\u2019s not hard to get a place off campus and handle it even during the summer as long as you don\u2019t rely solely on those financial aid returns to pay your housing",

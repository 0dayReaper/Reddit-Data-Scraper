Halfway through the semester, it became the place where we started planning regular hangouts for fun. So that might be something you want to try! Overall I would just recommend talking with the people in your classes, especially the ones that are part of your major. You're going to likely be taking a lot of classes together, so it's great to break the ice early on. Things have been a little tricky with so much being online, but I found it super easy to make friends in my in-person classes this semester.",

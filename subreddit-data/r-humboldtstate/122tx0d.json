    "postText": "Hey guys! I am planning on taking a gap year. I have already gotten in to Humboldt, but I was wondering if anyone knows how they feel about gap years/deferring for a year. I looked on the website and the only thing I could find was about deferring because of COVID back in 2021, but I couldn't find any current information. And if they do still allow it, will it make things more difficult for me when I do enroll?\n\n\nEdit: just want to make 1 thing clear. I'm not asking for opinions on whether or not i should take a gap year, so please stop doing that unless you actually have something relevant/helpful to say",

And nothing I say will make you think it's not a bad idea bc at the end of the day u are a random internet stranger whose opinion on that particular matter I didn't ask for :) so while I appreciate your 2 cents, I have that much under control, I was simply seeking objective information.\n\nAnd also I probably should've included this in the original post but I've emailed admissions and have gotten no reply ( it's been like 2 weeks)",

Also consider the effect if any on financial aid while you are researching.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to decide whether I want to move in the fall or wait until spring. I\u2019m wondering if anyone has experience or advice about renting out an apartment or house starting in January vs in the fall. Is it hard to find a place halfway through the school year?\nWhen should we start looking for a place if we want to rent in spring semester? \nAre there any apartment complexes you recommend? \nThank you!",

I suggest asking on the class Facebook page or asking anyone you know that is already there if they could ask around for you. Arcata property management, Humboldt Rentals, kkramer all own apartment complexes that students live in. I would suspect because of how fall semester is going to be you would have more options this fall than trying to wait for spring. Otherwise the reverse would normally be true.",

            "comment": "I only have experience renting starting in the fall, but the renting market is pretty competitive in the fall because there are a lot of openings as well as a lot of potential renters.  Stuff goes pretty quick.  I would suspect that in January the market might be a little slower.  You won't need to compete as much especially if you are just looking for a room.",

Houses are always harder to get into here because of the huge deposits and how long it takes for management companies to get back to you. Rn THERES a lot of vacancies in houses due to a lot of students not coming back but more might swarm in for spring. So just take that into account",

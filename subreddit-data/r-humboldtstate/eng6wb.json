            "comment": "Hi, I'm a geography major! I think we have a pretty good program with excellent faculty. We recently changed the geography department's name to GESA (geography, environment, and spatial analysis). I'm not a transfer, but I've met quite a few transfer students in the program, Matt Derrick is head of our department and is a great person to reach out to for further info. Overall, we seem to have outside opportunities for internships, experience, etc. I think this upcoming semester there is going to be a conference in Oakland that is open to all geography majors. You can choose to present your research or just tag along and learn something new. If you like making maps or working with GIS we have some pretty interesting classes you might like (I personally don't like anything about GIS, so I stick with more of the human side of geography). If you're interested in the physical side of geography you might want to get in touch with Rosemary Sheriff - she's good with sending out info on internships/jobs involving the physical world. She also teaches a few physical geography courses. I don't think you would have difficulty getting into a grad school - do you want to go to grad school specifically for geography? We also have a club that meets periodically and you get to meet more students and faculty through this. I've enjoyed it so far, so I definitely encourage you to check it out.",

There have been a fair number of racist harassment incidents.\n\nI was into amateur radio while in the area.  We had a regular who would often go on minutes-long rants about 'pedophile Muslims and liberal Democrats'.  I think I even recorded a few of those crazy rants...\n\nAdd to that most of these groups seem to take a special enjoyment in setting up shop in mostly left-leaning colleges like Berkley, Davis, etc, so they can play pretend oppressed victim and shit-stir, and I am not surprised in the least bit they have a presence at HSU.  They tend to attract students that, if not already conservative, are contrarian and have a disdain for whatever is mainstream or popular.",

It actually proves the legitimacy of a left movement if it is NOT funded by billionaires. \n\nThese Toilet Paper USA chuds have every 1st amendment right to look stupid on campus, but if they cross the line to harassment we can probably rally against it well. We are an HSI and majority identify as women, so we can really rally against their harassment better than a lot of places.",

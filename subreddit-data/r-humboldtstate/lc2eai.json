    "postText": "I\u2019ve been asking a lot about Humboldt but I have yet another question. I\u2019ve heard some bad things about the housing at Humboldt and that people often struggle to find affordable housing there especially because Humboldt has so few housing options. I wanted to know how true these claims were and if Humboldt provided any job opportunities as well. Thank you so much for any and all input!",

Look on Apartments.com, Zillow, and Craigslist yourself and you'll find lots of options.  Maybe there's a shortage in August when school is starting, but if you struggle 1.) contact HSU housing because they have connections to local rental agencies and 2.) Covid means most of the college students aren't actually attending locally.",

A couple years ago there was a pretty significant homelessness problem among students. You can find a decent place, but it might be challenging, and I'd make sure I have at least 750/month budgeted for a home and utilities.  Watch out for craigslist scams if you're searching there, and there are some rental agencies that make money off charging you a hefty fee to apply for a place. Avoid Humboldt Property Management.\n\nFinding a job out here wasn't too difficult in my experience, but with the service industry kinda screwed up at the moment, that may have changed.",

            "comment": "Two very different majors with some overlap in GE courses. Generally an enviro science degree would not have you working with animals on a personal level. Enviro science is a lot more to do with policy, restoration, planning etc. Wildlife management or zoology would be the direction for working with animals. With wildlife you could be involved with both animals and restoration. My friend majors in wildlife and has an eco-restoration minor so that\u2019s a possibility as well.",

You can focus on research regarding a specific species, work in policy, environment restoration, land management. And the HSU wildlife program is pretty well know and will definitely stand out when you apply to jobs. I would say most ESM jobs would be open to taking a wildlife major but not all wildlife jobs would be open to taking a ESM major. I recommend the wildlife program, it\u2019s amazing and has a lot of hands on classes!",

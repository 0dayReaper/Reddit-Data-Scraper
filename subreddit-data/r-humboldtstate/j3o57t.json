    "postText": "Hello \n\nI'm currently finishing up my last two semesters (Fall 2020 and Spring 2021) in order to get my ADT to transfer to Humboldt State University for fall 2021.  I will be transferring from College of the Sequoias.\n\nMy concerns are for student living off campus as this will be my first time living alone or at least with a roommate. As well as finding a job, I live in the valley and its hard enough as it is to get a job out here. I'm hoping it ill be different out there. I'll be 24 when I officially move out there and my only job experience is in education. Aside from housing and jobs I also wanted to know if I can still visit the campus, not an official tour but to get a feel for the area before  I move out there.\n\nAny help will greatly appreciated I'm eager to move out there especially considering classes are online and I can finished up my courses in Arcata before I start in the fall. Any advice for newcomers into the city of Arcata and a prospective student to HSU?",

            "comment": "Good luck in your last two semesters, and hopefully you're able to transfer to HSU. The campus is beautiful, and compared to larger schools isn't too bad to walk across (Walking from the BSS to Jolly Giant Commons is about the furthest you'd need to walk on campus.) Parking is an absolute bitch, if you're gonna live off campus and drive. I'd recommend getting to campus at least 1 hour before class starts to find parking. I've had a few occasions where I've driven in circles for 90 minutes, found no parking, and just left for the day. Housing is kind of expensive given the local pay, and amenities available (I used to live in a major city and my rent was roughly what it is here, but we had professional sports teams, rapid transit, many concert venues, and tons of places for food and drink.)\n\nIf you're not in good shape now, HSU will help with that. The walk from the parking lot at Jolly Giant Commons up to Founders Hall is a pretty hard walk on day one, but super easy by the time you're three weeks in...",

I live in a studio apartment by myself and 695 all together which is cheaper than on campus. Also, i\u2019m sure you can walk on campus. I\u2019ve done it a couple times to get my textbooks and walk around a bit.",

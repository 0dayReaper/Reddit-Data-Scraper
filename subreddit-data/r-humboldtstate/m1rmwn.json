    "postText": "I just submitted my application for the Fall 2021 semester and although I have not been accepted I was wondering if you guys have any tips on really what is the next step. My councilors take an awful long time to answer with COVID and I didn\u2019t think I wanted to go college until senior year so I have little knowledge on what I need to do. I would appreciate anything you have to say!",

If there are any items listed there, get those done ASAP so that your file is marked as complete and ready to review. If you don't have any items on your to-do list then you just gotta play the waiting game, it may take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to hear back. As of right now though, the best thing to do is to check if you can still fill out the FAFSA, especially since the deadline for many state financial aid programs was March 2.",

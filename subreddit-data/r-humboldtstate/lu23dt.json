It would be significantly easier and cheaper for me to stay in the area, but I don\u2019t know what kind of education I can get in this field if I stay. Are there any graphic designers here that went to HSU? Should I go somewhere else?",

I'm taking a graphic design class right now and it's pretty interesting but it's 100% at home. It might be good to ask professors what classes will be like in the coming semesters, and ask about computer labs and things like that.",

How at risk is a 20-year-old mountain bike u-locked in there?",

They steal bikes for resale value.\n\nFWIW,  back in the day,  bike storage was on the ground floor of Canyon buildings. That and the laundry room were the only uses for the ground floor.  I am sure it is quite different now. Probably better uses because there was a large room devoted to a very small number of bikes.",

I remember someones bike getting taken one time. \n\nId say the shed with the bikes is a good place. Havent seen it personally, but I know that shed is around the corner. im thinking its the one where the yard keepers are always at, so you will definitely have faculty around during the day all the time. \n\nGet a good lock is all i can say.",

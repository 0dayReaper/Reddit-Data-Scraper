What\u2019s your experience been like related to the vaccine and letting your school know your status? Do you feel safe on campus? Why or why not?\n\nI would especially love to hear from immunocompromised students or students living with immunocompromised friends or family members.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in speaking with me, reply to this post or send me a personal message.\n\nFor everyone else, good luck with the rest of the semester!",

    "postText": "Hello! I am starting school this Spring 2020 Semester. For one of my classes, Math 102 with Tim Lauck, there are 2 options for textbooks.   \nOne is a hardcover book, \"**Precalculus (w/Glued-In Access)\".** The other is \"**XYZ All-E-Content (Access 12 months Pass)\".** Both are rather expensive. Like with my other books, I was looking into buying or renting the hardcover book from some website that would be much cheaper. But if I do that, I may not get the access codes and such...  \nI guess my question is do I really need those access codes for the class?\n\nAnd whoever else took this class, which one do you prefer and is the best for the money, the hardcover or the electronic?",

Also took it with Tim, only got online book, they make you pay for the online program. It\u2019s pretty ridiculous, but they always find a way to make more money off already broke students.",

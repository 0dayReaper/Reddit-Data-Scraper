And Adam Carter, but he left for an industry position.\n\nChico State, Sac State or even UC Merced have much better CS programs. I have no idea how HSU is going to make the Cal Poly conversion work giving the housing shortage in Arcata and Eureka. It's going to be a nightmare.",

Even our \u201cengineering\u201d building is pretty bad right now, and although a new engineering building is being built, it\u2019ll probably take a bit to see any real substantial changes here. I\u2019m in ERE though, so take my words with a grain of salt.",

The kitchen is nice to have but is pretty small, so make sure that you and your roommates are on top of keeping it clean or it will quickly become unusable. \nIf you\u2019re into gaming or anything else that\u2019s internet-intensive, make sure to bring an ethernet cable, because they provide wired hookups in each room that are faster than the wifi.",

            "comment": "I've not lived in College Creek, but there are two obvious advantages.\n\n1. It's the newest residence hall. \n\n2. It's the closest walk to the north part of Arcata that has a grocery store and restaurants. Google pegs it as a 14 minute round trip. For comparison, Google pegs a walk from The J (more on that below) to be about 45 minutes roundtrip; I recall it being more like an hour, but maybe I walked slow. College Creek is about as close as you can get to being in Arcata proper while still on campus.\n\nThe 'con' is if you don't intend to prepare your own meals and want a meal plan, because The J cafeteria (the least expensive venue) is at the opposite end of campus. The Jolly Giant Complex (The J) is the linchpin of the original modern residence halls (The Canyon, The Hill, and Cypress), the focal point of life in that section of the campus.",

            "comment": "I lived on campus but it was before the creek building was a thing, lol. But the buildings look nice from the outside and there\u2019s a market with snack type foods and prepared foods right there, but it\u2019s pretty pricey I think. I wouldn\u2019t bring too much right away, usually space saving organizing kinda things are helpful, like an over the door shoe rack, under bed storage bins etc. Not sure of the layout in those rooms, just plan that it\u2019s smaller than you expect and don\u2019t show up with too much stuff. Reusable containers for foods could be helpful, laundry basket and supplies, plastic wrap and foil, etc, whatever you can get ahead of time because stores here are expensive compared to city pricing. Shower caddy kinda stuff so you can take it out of the shower since it\u2019s a shared space. Towels too of course. Maybe a fan and or white noise machine.",

    "postText": "So, I started what's meant to be a temporary job before heading up to HSU for Fall 2021 (I'm from the LA area) but I'm extremely conflicted now because I'm making good money and they want to promote me in the next month or so. Would it be possible to do all of this upcoming school year remotely (all but 2 of my classes this term are asynchronous online with no classroom learning and I could easily drop my 2 classes in person, they are 1 unit music classes) or would I end up having to be on campus for exams and stuff? Would it be possible to complete all of 2021-2022 school year online or would I have no choice but to head up in the Spring and hope I can get housing then (I have confirmed housing for Fall).",

They also made to sure let me know I could arrange to have that done through the mail instead. With the right classes, I think you could make a long distance online school year totally possible.",

Personally, if the class is an asynchronous online format, I don\u2019t see any reason you would have to be on campus BUT you\u2019d have to check in with professors about it.",

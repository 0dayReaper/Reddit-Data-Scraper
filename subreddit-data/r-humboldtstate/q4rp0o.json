    "postText": "I\u2019m not sure if this is allowed here or not, assuming it is; like the title says I\u2019m seeking platonic friends in humboldt county. I\u2019m 28m, just moved into a house in Fortuna from up north in OR/WA. I\u2019ve been on bumble friends and stuff trying to make connections but can\u2019t seem to gain any ground. I just got a new job and hoping to meet some folks there but would love to go on a hike, grab a beer/ coffee or just sit and get stoned in the back yard with somebody. I\u2019m super laid back and shy and it has been making friends next to impossible with Covid stuff going on.  Full disclosure mods, I do not attend humboldt state, or any school. I\u2019m posting here to find like minded folks my age.",

Anyways, you should look into local clubs and such, great way to make friends. I recommend finding a disk golf club, trash pickup club, etc,. Beyond that, I know before covid, Northtown Coffee hosted loads of events like open mics, stand up, and so on. 0retty friendly atmosphere",

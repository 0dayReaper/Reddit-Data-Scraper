Thanks everybody! \n\nHey everybody. I don't know about you, but I'm really upset about HSU insisting on in-person classes. Humboldt is getting hundreds of cases a day and even people who are careful are getting sick. HSU has been saying this semester would be in-person since September, but Omicron has seriously changed the situation and they refuse to adjust accordingly. The caseload is higher than it has ever been. If you're worried and upset, PLEASE [click this link to email the President of HSU.](mailto:hsupres@humboldt.edu?subject=Moving%20Spring%202022%20Online&amp;body=To%20the%20Office%20of%20President%20Jackson%3A%20%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20am%20a%20student%20at%20HSU%2C%20and%20I%20am%20writing%20to%20urge%20you%20to%20move%20classes%20online%20for%20the%20first%20few%20weeks%20of%20the%20Spring%202022%20semester.%20Humboldt%20County%20is%20already%20facing%20exponential%20growth%20of%20COVID-19%20cases%20following%20the%20holiday%20season.%20As%20students%20return%20to%20Humboldt%20from%20across%20the%20country%2C%20the%20danger%20posed%20by%20the%20transmissibility%20of%20the%20Omicron%20variant%20only%20increases.%20Requiring%20in-person%20attendance%20during%20this%20surge%20threatens%20the%20health%20of%20students%2C%20faculty%2C%20and%20the%20greater%20Humboldt%20community.%20This%20policy%20also%20endangers%20disabled%20and%20immunocompromised%20students%2C%20who%20are%20far%20more%20likely%20to%20suffer%20adverse%20outcomes%20if%20they%20become%20ill.%20I%20urge%20you%20to%20join%20the%2014%20other%20California%20State%20University%20campuses%20that%20have%20committed%20to%20curbing%20the%20spread%20of%20the%20Omicron%20variant%20by%20beginning%20the%20semester%20online.%20%0D%0A%0D%0ASincerely%2C%20%0D%0AA%20Concerned%20Student%0D%0A) The letter is already written, all you have to do is click 'Send'!\n\nThe email, for those who are interested, reads as follows:\n\nTo the Office of President Jackson:\n\nI am a student at HSU, and I am writing to urge you to move classes online for the first few weeks of the Spring 2022 semester. Humboldt County is already facing exponential growth of COVID-19 cases following the holiday season. As students return to Humboldt from across the country, the danger posed by the transmissibility of the Omicron variant only increases. Requiring in-person attendance during this surge threatens the health of students, faculty, and the greater Humboldt community. This policy also endangers disabled and immunocompromised students, who are far more likely to suffer adverse outcomes if they become ill. I urge you to join the 14 other California State University campuses that have committed to curbing the spread of the Omicron variant by beginning the semester online.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA Concerned Student",

CalPoly seems to be an absolute nightmare right now, and cases are skyrocketing all over the state and in our own county. What evidence exactly are they following that makes them think that not delaying in person instruction is a good idea? Just about EVERY single other CSU has given a week to two week delay. Smells suspect to me :)",

Its easy to think of people with these pre-existing conditions as only extreme cases, like people with cancer. But most people don't realize that a pre-existing condition is literally ANYTHING that is wrong with you. Diabetes, being overweight, high blood pressure, even depression can seriously impact your immune system. Asthma is a very common issue and it can make you at higher risk of severe illness if you contract covid. Autoimmune diseases are also way more common than people think, and even minor ones are frequent comorbidities. Physical limitations can be a problem also, especially if you require help that means you have to be around people all the time, like if you have a home health aid. Then its really important to limit risk because you're already at higher risk from being unable to isolate.",

It\u2019s not inclusive to the many learning types or learning disabilities and this isn\u2019t 1983. A video recording should not be so difficult to obtain in 2022.

Also I'm sure there are LOTS of disabled students who receive help from family members or members of their household.",

Everyone is going to get the new strain and there is nothing you can do to prevent that. There is no point in trying to contain it if there is no plan at any level. Just get the vax so you don't die and live your life.",

The original petition was to pause in person for a measly 2-3 weeks just to slow any potential strain on our limited healthcare system here which is not likely to kill any student/faculty/staff and lowers the chances of a large outbreak on campus. This letter is for additional visibility for vulnerable students/faculty/staff. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t noticed, a lot of our faculty are older as well and they may have sick family members and loved ones at home. You may not go to the hospital because you\u2019re triple vaxxed, but the antiVaxxer down the street you ran across in the store and infected might. Only 62% of the population is fully vaxxed up here. \n\nIf we clog the hospitals people will have to be flown to other areas, if there\u2019s a bed, like what was happening here before. This causes chain reaction issues. Car accident, you\u2019re fucked. Someone has a heart attack they\u2019re fucked. Need that cancerous tumor removed? Your surgeries canceled. It\u2019s not just about students, it\u2019s about the community. They expect peak hospital surge in mid February throughout California if you haven\u2019t read the latest news. If you don\u2019t support any of this, cool. Don\u2019t sign, don\u2019t participate and write a counter letter if you so wish. If we do continue with in person which seems likely, have an outbreak, and HSU decides to pivot to online for the rest of the semester, don\u2019t be surprised. \n\nThis shows current ICU occupancy up here. There\u2019s very few beds when there isn\u2019t a pandemic. https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/hospitals/. In the case you get paywalled our current 3 hospitals are at 89%, 88%, 75% ICU occupancy right now.\n\n[California on track for worst Covid surge yet](https://www.redbluffdailynews.com/2022/01/14/california-on-track-for-worst-covid-surge-yet)",

The worst case scenario is already happening. Just because students aren't going to class doesn't mean they aren't going into town and that isn't even considering private maskless gatherings. This isn't something that can be solved from the top down. It's going to have to be question of personal responsibility and whether or not you decide to be safe. I am in no way justifying this but that is just the reality.",

I have been inside, alone, for two years now. You think I'm not exhausted? You think I don't want to be spending my 20s going out to bars and restaurants, you think I don't want to be dancing and going on dates and having casual sex? **This pandemic always has and always will be what we make it.** And it's easy to be aloof and to shirk our individual responsibility when the virus is kept at arms length. But for people who are fighting in the shit - for people with disabilities who STILL can't go to a restaurant, for med students who are giving up because they're already burnt out and disillusioned from constantly trying to save people who hate them for it, for nurses who piled body bags into refrigerated trucks in the parking lots because the morgues are too full - thats a luxury we cant afford.",

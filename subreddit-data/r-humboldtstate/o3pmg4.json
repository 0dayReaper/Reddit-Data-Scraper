    "postText": "Background: I'm a transfer student that will be attending HSU in the fall, my major is marine biology, and I currently stay in the San Francisco Bay Area. \n\nEver since April of this year, I've been searching for off-campus housing, and I'm still coming up empty handed. Currently, I've submitted applications to Strombeck, Kramer, Roger's Rentals, Fawncreek, Moser, and various other real estate agencies, and while a few of them have accepted my application as a tenant, no spaces have opened up for me to place a hold on. I've tried to secure single occupancy rooms as well as rooms with other people, but I (as well as my prospective roommates) are still at a loss.\n\nInitially, my backup plan was to just live on campus if I can't find something off-campus (more expensive yeah, but housing is housing), but now that I'm number 40-something on the dorms waitlist, and there's only two months left until classes start, I'm gradually moving towards a persistent state of panic. \n\nWith this post, my intention isn't to garner sympathy or ask for handouts, but to ask for advice on what I should do next, given my situation. Any input, guidance, or links to resources that can help me or other people facing similar issues is greatly appreciated.",

Last year when students left because of covid, there were so many rentals Available that they were doing rent specials. I think what happened is that non-students moved into the apartments during the pandemic and so we are no longer seeing the turnover at the end of the spring semester.  \n\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re doing everything you need to do but you\u2019re in a situation waiting to see if something opens up. My hope is that some people with leases expiring in august leave. We renewed our year lease 6 months early with Kramer to secure our apartment. That\u2019s how wild this area is right now. If you haven\u2019t reached out the the off campus housing liaison, definitely do that. She\u2019s gonna know more than any of us do. She helped me get my apartment here a few years back",

I would also look at Craigslist, I have found my past two living situations on there. You need to be wary of scams but I would say it's pretty easy to find a lot of good options on there.",

Checking college of the redwoods off campus housing site might be useful also as it has students already in the area. Best of luck to you! Finding housing around here is really a challenge lately.",

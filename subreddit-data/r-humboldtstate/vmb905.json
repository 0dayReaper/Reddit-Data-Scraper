I\u2019m a incoming freshman in eop and also foster youth. Is there a chance I will get into a dorm? Or should I start looking for another solution. If not I have no idea what to do. I live 14 hours away in San Diego.",

It is very late to be joining the wait list.\n\nThe [off-campus housing coordinator](https://housing.humboldt.edu/resident-resources/off-campus) is having a streamed 'open house' on July 22 and 29th.  I would make an appointment and speak to her sooner though.",

After July 15th, come in contact with housing to see how far up on the waitlist you are (there\u2019s no live system to check, just call or email housing). July 15th is the deadline for people who already have campus housing to cancel it with no penalties, so a bunch of people will drop.",

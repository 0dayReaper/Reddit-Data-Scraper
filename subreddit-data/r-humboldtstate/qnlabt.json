Is the program any good? And do y\u2019all like this school? Let me know. I\u2019m from a small town so I love nature and I\u2019ve loved Humboldt county every time I\u2019ve visited!",

            "comment": "I would look into how Humboldt is transitioning to a polytechnic college - the psych program here is likely to not receive funding in the future. They are going to be focusing on STEM programs more, specifically environmentally-focused STEM programs.\n\nI would recommend staying at your own college or focusing on finding a school that will support your major. Not to mention that if you're looking for a degree that you will be able to get into a good grad school with, Humboldt is likely not the place. We are not known for psych. We are mostly known for environmental sciences.\n\nIt's a great community and lovely area - but you also have to understand how desperate the housing crisis is here. It takes me months and months to find any availabile apartment every time I have to move, despite making decent income. Still, a 1 bedroom goes for ~$1000 in Arcata at the low end. With roommates you bump that down to $500-$700. With the meal plan on campus, I was paying a little under $1300 a month.\n\nI would say that it's also a major culture shock to be away from a larger city. We are **remote** here. There is no major city closer than 3 hours away.\n\nAll in all, I would really not recommend moving here for psychology. If you want to change your degree and are of a certain kind of personality that enjoys the lack of stimulation that comes from living in a laid-back rainy coastal town full of hippies - then awesome. If you want to focus on the quality of your psych education I would very much not recommend it.",

It's got good teachers, but honestly the whole school is going to be going through a transition phase for the next 5-10 years.\n\nLots of classes have difficult scheduling due to budget cuts in prior years. They might be getting massive funding soon, but that will take years for us to see the positive effects of this. In the meantime, we have a massive homelessness problem even among students. The school should be ashamed that they accept students and then have no place to house them.\n\nHonestly I have been less than thrilled with my education at Humboldt. It was obviously an issue everywhere with the pandemic, but they did not support their current students enough through this process. The school has been rife with budget cuts for years now.\n\nPlease be sure that you actually want to do environmental science. It's a big change from psych, especially so with some concentrations. If you're sure about it though, the school is recognized nationally for a few of it's programs like env. science, wildlife studies, and botany. It's a good school for GSP.\n\nThat said the UC system is definitely better regarded than any CSU by most employers. Either way, I wish the best for you! I would recommend starting to look for apartments in April/May if you do decide to move the HSU and want to live off campus, even if you won't be moving till August - the housing problem is seriously no joke. Especially if you want a place that isn't old, been used for weed grows, or damp and moldy.",

I'm in environmental resources engineering here and yeah the scheduling has been really rough with classes getting cancelled but that's entirely due to faculty flight during the pandemic, especially these past 2 semesters with so many lecturers quitting. Engineering is getting a shit ton of funding with the polytechnic plans, but the issue right now is with retaining and hiring department staff which honestly is an issue in ALL areas of education at EVERY school right now since so many professors have burned out.\n\nI'm also weary of your dismissal of HSU's status in employers eyes because it's not a UC. It's becoming a polytechnic, that will elevate it's status in the public eye a ton. I would wager to bet CSU Cal Poly SLO's stem grads are better regarded by employers than grads from some UCs. And in terms of environmental programs, HSU is already very well regarded by grad schools and employers.\n\nI'm sorry your experience at HSU isn't everything you hoped it would be. I've certainly felt frustrated here at times. But I've found the faculty and administration to be very supportive when I stand up for myself and rally other students. I'm optimistic for the future. Hopefully you will feel the same.\n\nEdit: You're totally right about budget cuts leading to reduced class offerings, I read up on the issue from articles like this one and have to say I'm pretty disappointed. That's probably why a lot of lecturers in my department have quit. https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2020/dec/8/hsu-faculty-union-says-budget-driven-cuts-courses/",

I was a solid C student in high school and past colleges and I got in nearly instantly with preferred enrollment.\n\nI have loved most of my teachers. But when the administration won't offer them enough benefits to retain them, then they leave. The last HSU president was corrupt and lining her own salary by like $300,000 while lower-level educators may struggle to pay rent in Humboldt. The current president is ineffective and has basically abandoned the current students that were there when he took over. Funding is likely to not pan out in terms of class offerings till Fall 2023 at the earliest.\n\nMeanwhile, 1/8 HSU students are homeless and they're sitting on literally half a billion dollars. They were so strapped for cash till this point that they would accept basically everyone that applied, even if they couldn't promise to house them. Certain majors have such rigid class schedules that any kind of unforeseen circumstances can cause you to need an extra semester. The library has been unusable since the start of the pandemic. On-campus dining is now fully privatized and for profit instead of regulated by students/staff, which it was until previously.\n\nI truly feel that this school is not helping it's current students succeed.",

Neither of us are in psych so I know this is different but I will say that I love it here and my sister low-key hates UCSD lol. \n\nCompared to her school, students at HSU can get a lot of support and resources. You just have to know where to look. It's also way easier to get into the classes you want here compared to a big UC school, at least in my experience. And class sizes are way smaller and you get to know your professor, rather than primarily interacting with a TA or grad student. \n\nAnother thing is housing, which is scarce at both schools. But at least the housing here is less expensive than housing in Santa Barbara. \n\nI was torn between UCSC and HSU but I am so glad I chose here. I have joined some fun organizations here that I'm glad to be a part of. Even though most of my time here has been online, I honestly really have loved it. Good luck with which ever pathway you choose.",

But they change their meal plans this year to a private company to broaden their selections. Supposedly gonna have a lot of more vegan and vegetarian stuff. But my partner was vegan for a while and he found he didn\u2019t really feel restricted.",

A lot of the options by the time I get there are not vegan. And mostly include potatoes, fruit, or some type of cold pasta. I have the lowest meal plan for if i run out of groceries and i need some then i rely on my points to carry me through the rest of the month.\n\nI hope that helps!",

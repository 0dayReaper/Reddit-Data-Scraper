    "postText": "Im a high school senior and CSU apps opened a few days ago and I'm trying to narrow down my list. I'm considering getting rid of HSU because I've heard that it gets boring and there not much to do considering its so isolated. Is this true? I live in the LA area so I'm used to having an abundance of fun things and places to go to when I get bored, so is HSU not right for me because of that? I know its like 5 hours from the bay area so I'm kinda leaning towards not applying here but I want to get some insight from actual students. \n\nedit: okay so after hearing some opinions, Humboldt sounds really interesting. now i'm more concerned with choosing between HSU and Chico State. I'm only applying to 5 cal states and this will be the 5th so i have to choose lol. so do any of you know anything about chico? is there anything about humboldt that sets it apart from chico besides the redwoods and beaches?",

If I had to guess I'd bet there are places more focused on film. With that said I've met film majors that seemed pretty happy here.\n\nI came to HSU for small class sizes and he strong natural sciences program. There are people here who share my passions, and I love that. I would base your decision on where you think your best opportunities for growth are, and what's going to be easiest on your budget. \n\nWithin the county there are: movie theaters, small restaurants, coffee shops, used book stores, thrift stores, In n Out, ice cream shops, lots of trails and parks, cool old hippies and cool young hipsters. \n\nThere is the activity page that lost coast outpost runs with all kinds of things to do. \n\nThere is the Bayshore Mall, but compared to SoCal it's more like a strip mall... there's a Walmart in it, the DMV moved in there, but there's also some shops left and a food court.  \n\nA lot of things are closed now but eventually things will open up unless they go out of business first. So there is cool stuff to do here, and a lot of folks are into the arts. It really depends on what you're into.\n\nIt also fogs/rains a lot, (like, alot alot.) and HSU is nicknamed Hills And Stairs University. Public transit is poor, and housing limited. Fyi.",

I only hear good things from them, but I will say, from my experience in the photography classes, the tuition is cheap here so the equipment is old.  You won't be getting top of the line equipment or anything but you generally don't need that for things like film.  Like sure you might enjoy having a red camera or something, but you don't need it to learn the craft.  Idek if Chapman has a red anyways.  I'm not sure how much of the equipment you'll be using in covid times anyways.",

Your opportunities, resources, and education to prepare you for that industry will be vastly superior. \n\nHumboldt's film program is fine. Professors are nice enough. It's fun and easy. There is a heavy focus on creating socially conscious work, as is the case throughout the rest of thre school. But the bar for quality work out of the students seemed very low. They are not concerned with sending graduates out into the world with a quality reel. \n\nThat said, Humboldt is gorgeous and a wonderful escape from the busyness and chaos of LA. It's one of the best places to explore the outdoors. If you need big city amenities--and there's no shame in that (I love eating out, so the only real downside of the area for me was the tiny amount of good food options)--you will absolutely be bored.",

I'd spent my whole life in major cities, and compared to even like Long Beach, Arcata and the surrounding area is pretty bland. But it's what you make of it. I loved that there was no traffic, never felt like I was running the rat race and loved just pulling up and staring out into the sea or getting lost in the forrest. Everything shuts down early, but you adapt. I would get a little stir crazy and go home for a few days (pre-pandemic) and get my city fix and go back. If COVID-19 hadn't happened I would still be up there, still trying to get back for grad school next year. But yeah definitely not the most active area, but if you want something different than anywhere you've  lived, it's the place.",

Plenty of hikes, beaches, restaurants, farmers markets, etc. that are super fun when you find friends to enjoy them with. It's a slower pace of life, but you don't have to deal with smog, traffic, or heat waves.

    "postText": "I'm starting my freshman year at Humboldt State this year and was looking for advice for what dorm I should choose. The freshman options are the Hill and Canyon. It says Canyon is freshman and upperclassmen and the Hill is only freshman. I would love to hear anyone's advice who goes to Humboldt or knows anything about the campus!! :)",

            "comment": "So I was just dorming in the Canyon for my freshmen year (before covid).\n\nBoth dorms have a lot of great qualities to them and I spent a lot of times in both dorm buildings. If your a STEM major then you should choose themed housing in the hill hands down, how they have summer introduction set up these people will be your friends for at least the first semester. Otherwise it gets a bit more whether you want to be surrounded and close to a bunch of people or be in smaller groups. \n\nGoing into depth about the Canyon first. There is four floors, with the first one having a small common room where really only one group can go hangout at once and a kitchen/laundry room. Don't count on using the kitchen in either the Canyon or the Hill, they are super super gross. Some buildings seemed to have a more tight knit community and would have movie nights or weekend hangouts, others there was barley any interactions. Each floor has only a handful of rooms and maybe 15 or so people living on them. The bathroom was small and usually disgusting (I was on the mens' floor if that changes anything). There is a single RA for the entire building, so if there is a group being loud or people running around in the hallway your out of luck unless you email or call the RA. Its rather close to the J (where you will be eating at a lot) and also very close to the late night snack convenient store. \n\nWhile I have less experience with the Hill I've spent a lot of time second semester there. The rooms are skinnier, but the desks don't block the window like they do in the Canyon. The common room is much bigger with vending machines, lots of couches, and tables. There is a single laundry room for the entire building (2 buildings). There is two RA's per floor and so if people are loud they will know. The bathrooms are much nicer, even with more people using them. The showers are more like small rooms that you can undress easily in as opposed to the regular standing showers in the Canyon. For both buildings I never had to wait to shower or use the restroom. Because there are a lot of freshmen there for a long while they will think it's super fun to yell insults to the other building at late hours of the night, this happens in the Canyon too, but to a lesser degree. Like the Canyon it is next to the J, but it is six flights of stairs to the cupboard which can be annoying. Also less stairs to your classes which is a plus, much more central campus.\n\nOverall they are both good options to choose from and it really comes down to less or more people to share a space with. If you are a STEM major, choosing your community learning option is extremely nice and something I regret doing since all my friends lived in the Hill. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully that helps!",

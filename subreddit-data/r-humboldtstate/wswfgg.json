    "postText": "With my current fall 2022 schedule I'm going to have to walk from BSS to Music A or B 3 times per week for classes. Is this even possible? Please keep in mind I'm quite overweight so I will have to walk slower in order to not get sweaty. I mean I know Google Maps says 7 minutes but idk if that's feasible. Idk if it takes into account the hillyness and also wearing a backpack. Also I will be carrying my clarinet in my clarinet case.",

Especially since the first few weeks of the fall semester are always hotter than the rest of the year. Try to keep your backpack as light as possible since you\u2019ll also be carrying your instrument. Just FYI the hills around the BSS are pretty rough from any direction unless you\u2019re super fit",

            "comment": "I stubbornly avoid going upstairs/hills whenever possible because I'm asthmatic.\n\nSo from BSS to music a/b my path would be:\n\nLeave bss, walk down parking lot hill toward wildlife building/greenhouse. Go between those buildings and enter science B east door. Take elevator to 3rd floor. Walk across catwalk into sci a. Exit west door of sci a into parking lot. Walk up tiny hill of sci a parking lot, cross street.\n\nIf youre going to music a/1st floor music b. Enter art building and go through it to exit into art quad. \n\nIf you're on second floor of music b then you'll bypass art building. Instead after you cross the street from sci a, walk down the little road that leads to the quad and there's a door that enters directly onto 2nd floor of music b. \n\nElevator/entering sci b can be skipped, but you'll have a bit more hill walking. There's a small foot path that leads to up to the sci a parking lot from the west side of the sci b building. Quicker but its going to make your calves burn as you hustle up the path. You can also take the elevator in sci a to avoid the small hill in the parking lot but it'll take time because the sci a elevator is slow af and spooky. \n\n\nGoing the opposite direction is more challenging and you have to go up a hill/stairs no matter what because the bss is on top of a hill. From music a/b I would go directly from art quad straight down B st, past natural resources and go through the CCAT parking lot up to bss. I find that hill the easiest to walk up personally.",

Like others said in the beginning it will be hard but you can adapt. Be ready to rush outta class and make a mad dash.",

My fall semester MWF was once a 9am in BSS, 10am in founders, 11am in NR \ud83d\ude43 I would regularly show up sweaty but I just learned to wear layers that I could take off and put back on throughout the day.

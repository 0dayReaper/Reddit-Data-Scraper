[This page](https://housing.humboldt.edu/cost-options/theme-housing) notes the rainbow/gender inclusive housing is in Creekview and it's open to all students. But some other residence halls are indeed restricted by class level.",

I can't mesh the orientation I received (a several day series of events called the Humboldt Orientation Program) with your concern because there would not be a way for students from other dorms to know what dorm I came from.\n\nI vaguely recall a three-legged race on the Cypress lawn that may have been grouped by residence hall, but students were not required to participate in the social events. \n\nWhat do your parents have to do with your concern?\n\nAs it used to be, the only events I was *required* to attend in the Humboldt Orientation Program were bread and butter issues... meeting a counselor in my degree program, registering for classes, and such.\n\nEdit: alright, downvote away. I wasn't expressing skepticism. I was trying to understand in order to help. I suspect OP has a misunderstanding of how first year orientation works. Oh well.",

So if their parents show up to help them move in to the happy rainbow housing they're going to be confused/concerned and/or the poster will be outed just by reason of moving into this dorm.",

If the parents try to impose and attend *where they have not been invited*, OP should contact the orientation program (707-826-5696 or \norientation [at] humboldt [dot] edu) and ask to speak to someone who manages the inclusive housing. Get their perspective and help.\n\nMaybe the housing rep can intercept OP's parents in person on campus and explain to them the event is only for students. After all, when report cards come out, the grades are sent to the adult students, not to Mommy and Daddy. It's time for parents need to accept they're not involved in every aspect of their child's life anymore. \n\nIf I was the rep, be persuaded to write a generic-sounding letter and send it only to OP's parents informing 'all incoming first year students' that parents and siblings cannot attend the orientation events due to covid protocols.\n\nIt's a shame people run to the downvote button assuming the worst of a person.",

The only problem I can see is if they're not bringing their own car, likely their parents will still have to drop them off. But maybe they can provide a cart so the parents can drop at the main area of campus and the student can migrate their stuff that way? I have absolutely no clue how the school is set up, this post just popped up as recommended for some reason to me.",

Parents will see inside the dorm at drop-off, when picking up or dropping off for holiday breaks, and at the end of the school year. I don't see a way around this. \n\nOP should contact the person who manages inclusive housing and request the housing office begin considering the dilemma of students who are in-the-closet to their parents. Like, pair two closeted students together in unthemed housing.\n\nThe housing roommate form does (or did in my time) ask student viewpoints on such issues. At the very least, OP could hopefully get roomed in unthemed housing with a roommate who doesn't care.",

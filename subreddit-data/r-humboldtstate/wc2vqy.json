I like to play video games at night (particularly online games) and I\u2019m curious what it has been like for my fellow gamers! Is it bad, decent, etc?",

Wifi will always provide an inferior speed.\n\n&gt;Except for Campus Apartments, all rooms have at least one wired Ethernet port that provides you with fast, reliable Internet access.  You can use this connection for your desktop PC, laptop, gaming console, streaming media player, or smart TV.  Simply connect an Ethernet cable from your device to the Ethernet port in your room.\n\n&gt;You may NOT use this port to connect a personal wireless router or network switch. Residents found doing so will be disconnected from the network.\n\n[source](https://housing.humboldt.edu/resnet/getting-connected)",

You will have a hard time watching videos. My tip is what I did loaned a portable hotspot from the library it's free and it's way faster around 50 MB average",

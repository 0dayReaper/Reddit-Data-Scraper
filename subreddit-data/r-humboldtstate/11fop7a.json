    "postText": "i\u2019ve been conditionally admitted as a lower division transfer pending my transcripts. i\u2019m worried that my gpa at my community college has dipped to low mainly because i\u2019ve signed up for classes, decided not to take them, and then forgotten to withdrawal thus resulting in some F\u2019s. the classes i have actually tried in have resulted in good grades. is there any way i could avoid getting my admission rescinded? will the school even care if my gpa has dipped?",

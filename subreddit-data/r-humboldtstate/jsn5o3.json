Also I can\u2019t afford the dorms for freshmen year at Humboldt so im thinking it\u2019s cheaper to rent a room. \nIs there any links to find housing or a room to rent for awhile?",

If you can afford $800 a month you definitely have options. \n\nThere\u2019s also an off campus housing coordinator and I believe she\u2019s got all these links to housing but I think she also matches you up with other HSU students looking for off campus housing, so you can find a 3 bedroom together.",

    "postText": "So I bought a bike when I got here with the plan to bike around but forgot to factor in that A. I have weak jello legs. B. I also am up in Creekview. I figured I could just practice and get better at biking uphill when it comes to going to the store, but I started rolling backwards on my way up to Creekview lol. To any Creekview residents, are you guys biking up that hill? Is it just a matter of building strength or is there a bike friendly shortcut through the forest path? Would love any tips. I wondered if it might be better to keep my bike somewhere down the hill but I'm worried it'll be stolen.",

            "comment": "What kinda bike are you riding? I have a road bike and am able to get up it, but I also cycle a lot up very high grades to work out. I have a friend here I made start cycling with me and at the beginning of the semester and he had to walk his mountain bike up every big hill (Union St gets the best of us.) However, he got frustrated with that and started working out twice a week on the stationary bikes at the gym doing high intensity intervals and within 2 or 3 weeks he significantly improved and hasn't needed to get off his bike at all. So that's something you can try if you want to make more rapid improvements. I'd honestly really recommend it if you're into cycling because the best bike rides around here require some steep climbs, so getting good at ascending will open up so many scenic routes for you. Best of luck!",

My personal rec as someone who lived in creekview. don't leave your bike outside. it will be stolen.\n\nThe hill is not bad after a while but generally speaking things like beach cruisers and heavy bikes won't make it you need gears and to be on the lightest one",

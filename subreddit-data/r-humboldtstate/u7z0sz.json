I know that the handbook says that no lights designed for festivities are allowed except for two weeks before the given holiday, so lowkey a stupid question on my part, but I wasn't sure because it seems like string lights have been a lot more for decoration than festivity now and a lot of them are just advertised as fairy or string lights rather than Christmas lights.",

I would recommend not getting the bluetooth ones because other people probably will have the same kind and accidentally connect to yours. I would often wake up to someone turning on their LED lights and it messing with mine as well.",

[page 36](https://housing.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/handbook.pdf):\n\n&gt;Lighting designed for festive purposes is only allowed 2 weeks prior to a major event or holiday and shall be removed immediately following.\n\nThis rule didn't exist in the 1990s. I had Christmas lights in my room year-round. This was before LED lights, so they consumed a good amount of electricity.\n\n I wonder if they added this rule before LED lighting became commonplace. It might be worth it for someone involved in the residence hall governance to ask about the rule.  It's categorized under the 'health and safety' section, which sounds like baloney for LED lighting. If they have a specific safety concern, then maybe the specific concern should be made the rule.",

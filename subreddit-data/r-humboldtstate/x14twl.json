The rooms that have no windows were deemed unlivable by the fire marshal. I was a resident living in one of those rooms. It was terrible, truly just a horrible room to live in.",

Like u/cailic mentioned, it was found to be a safety hazard by the fire marshal because the room had no window. HSU knocked down part of the wall and turned it into essentially a triple, which is just one normal double room that is now connected to the \u201cdungeon room\u201d. I have pictures in case you need a visual.",

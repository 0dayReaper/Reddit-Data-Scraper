    "postText": "As Fall 2020 finally ends\n\nMy takeaways are:\n\n\u00b7 I put a lot of work into my online classes over the summer. I need to put twice as much more into them to make them better.\n\n\u00b7 Everything seems to be due on Friday or Sunday night.\n\n\u00b7 Zoom is like my ex; I have some found memories but those are far outweighed by the overall toxic relationship.\n\n\u00b7 Discussion forums can be forces of good when designed correctly. I failed.\n\n\u00b7 Repetition in instructions, due dates, and expectations is a good thing.\n\n\u00b7 Four cases of wine were not enough.\n\n\u00b7 Extensions are not a big deal. Students can complete 15 weeks of work in five days \u2013 how they do it is beyond me.\n\n\u00b7 2020 threw everything it had and more at all of us. Compassion and understanding are essential.\n\n\u00b7 I need a larger supply of \u201cnorth coast crops.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 Students will respond to emails from Wk 2 in Wk 16. That\u2019s Ok.\n\n\u00b7 Guidance from administration is like following the north star only to find out it\u2019s the direct flight to LAX.\n\n\u00b7 Deadlines are suggestions and the points really don\u2019t matter.\n\n\u00b7 We would all be doomed if it weren\u2019t for the Library.\n\n\u00b7 Reusable water bottles make great shakers for margaritas to get you through department meetings.\n\n\u00b7 Office hours are the only social interactions that we have some weeks.\n\n\u00b7 The mute button is your friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy commitments for Spring 2021:\n\n\u00b7 Keep it simple.\n\n\u00b7 Eliminate the group assignments.\n\n\u00b7 Eat a few more fruits and vegetables.\n\n\u00b7 Be aware that I need to write out what I want students to do. Leaving it for them to extrapolate my expectations  increase stress and workload.\n\n\u00b7 Cut all course assignment by 70%. Focus on what matters.\n\n\u00b7 Scaffold assignments to make the end of the semester easier.\n\n\u00b7 Have a martini or cocktail with lunch every day.\n\n\u00b7 Over communicate to my classes. It\u2019s ok if they delete the message without reading it.\n\n\u00b7 Week 1 and 2 are critical. That\u2019s where issues start, and problems can be headed off.\n\n\u00b7 Encouraging Credit/No Credit is good thing.\n\n\u00b7 Always keep a vape pen nearby.\n\n\u00b7 If the meeting doesn\u2019t have an agenda don\u2019t go.\n\n\u00b7 Be flexible but don\u2019t be Gumby.\n\n\u00b7 Keep recorded lectures to no more than 10 minutes, preferably 6.\n\n\u00b7 Take more walks. Eat more pastries.",

Not all of them are book-nerd, sober sally mormons.  The culture of the north coast also doesn't tend to lead to very many sober folks.\n\n\n\nSide note, there are professors and department heads who REGULARLY are visibly intoxicated AT WORK (pre-covid, when we were still having classes at school). One in particular is known for keeping a case of beer in their vehicle at all times, and has been know to drink a beer on field trips directly before driving.",

That's one list. The real list to start from is the one your insurance company provides on its website, which may list different/more therapists.\n\n&gt;The ones who do take insurance have a six month waiting list.\n\nI can recommend a therapist for you who takes insurance and doesn't have a waiting list who is based in NoHum.",

So I called and was eventually told \"your application never got placed in the folder it should have been\" and that they effectively lost my application.\n\nA few weeks later I was rejected for some bs reason, something along the lines of \"Your transcript indicates you need more preparation for your choice of major\" I don't recall the specific wording. So I applied again the next year with the exact same transcript, and was accepted. Which left me thinking they rejected me as it was too late to process or something. This still frustrates me as I trusted they were processing it correctly and it delayed my school plans by a whole year.\n\ntldr: **do not trust the administration/staff in a situation like this**, you need to keep on top of them or it could go horribly wrong",

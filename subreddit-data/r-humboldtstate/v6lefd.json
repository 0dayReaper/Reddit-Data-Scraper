    "postText": "hello! me and my friend are both going to be freshman at humboldt this fall. we thought we did our housing in a timely matter but didn\u2019t realize how competitive it was. we\u2019re both currently on a waiting list. is it worth it to stay on or should we both just start looking for off campus housing? my friend also deals with severe mental health issues and wanted to mention that to housing so she can be close to resources. is that even worth her mentioning or are we just guaranteed no housing this year?",

            "comment": "I would for sure still have your friend mention her mental health to housing and residential support, it\u2019s absolutely worth the shot, but definitely start looking for off campus housing ASAP. If you do get off the waitlist, great, you won\u2019t need the other options but if you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t want to be screwed and have absolutely nowhere to live. Housing is competitive and others have already been looking for off campus housing for a little while, start looking and applying now before it\u2019s too late. Good luck!",

Although, unfortunately, it may not be until later in the summer, depending on your waitlist number. Feel free to email housing@humboldt.edu and ask for updates on how close we are getting to your waitlist number.",

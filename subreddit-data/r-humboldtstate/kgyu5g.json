I\u2019m talking like $350 round trip to sfo and $700 to lax. Lots of students drive home, carpool, they also had a chartered kinda bus last year, not sure if there was a cost or not. There\u2019s also the Greyhound/Amtrak (is a bus until the Bay Area.) Alum from many years ago but still live in Arcata.",

Amtrak bus picks up from Arcata, Eureka, and Fortuna. And then transfers to a train in Martinez and ends in Bakersfield where there are busses further south and further west.",

Tickets run around $100 round trip and the bus leaves HSU at 6-7am the first Saturday of break and picks up students in LA at that time the last Saturday of break with a stop in San Francisco and two stops for food along the way. Apart from this you can try zimride to carpool with other hsu students commuting home for break and split the cost of gas. I\u2019ve used greyhound before and would stay away from it unless you have no other options, the frequent stops/layovers extend the trip significantly",

Students drive 12 hours to San Diego, so further than that to bother with the expense of a plane trip. A cursory look shows flights costing $500+ to San Francisco in December.",

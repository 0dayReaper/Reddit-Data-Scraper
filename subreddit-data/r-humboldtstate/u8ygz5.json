    "postText": "Sophomore here trying to make a decision. I came to Cal Poly Humboldt to study wildlife conservation, because I care about animals and I have strong interest in conservation and the environment. I debate switching to ESM a lot because I am unsure whether or not I want my studies to only be animal focused. I really want to work in restoration careers and enjoy most aspects of environmental science. Gave myself an ESM Eco Resto minor but it would extend me another year.",

            "comment": "This is a late reply for you but I graduated with my degree in Wildlife Conservation. Graduated and worked a bit then returned Humboldt, working as a biologist the whole time. This field is BRUTAL. You will be overworked, underpaid, exploited. I work two jobs right now, and that's looking like a common sight for us. So I would reccommend you look at employment prospects post-graduation to determine which major you want. I do know that fisheries and forestry has steady employment but wildlife is just too competitive.",

I\u2019ve heard multiple reports of the long Q tip into the nasal cavity as well as other about a throat swab and both nostrils swab. I\u2019m moving up in January and am just curious about it. :)",

It's a self-administered test and you get a swab that you put up into your nostril \"until you feel resistance\" (so that varies for everyone depending on the depth of their nasal cavity- mine probs goes up about an inch and a half) and then you rotate/twist the swab 3 times and leave it in place for 15 seconds (they time it for you) and then you move on to the other nostril. It's really not  bad, I used to tear up a lot and sneeze at the end but I'm totally used to it now lol. Don't be worried!",

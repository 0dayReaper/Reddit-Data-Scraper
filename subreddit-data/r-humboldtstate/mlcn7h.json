    "postText": "Hello, I have my room selection appointment Thursday and will be in Klamath connection housing group. It appears that Redwood Hall ( in the Hill ) is the assigned themed housing area. Anyone live in Redwood and have any recommendations as to better floors to live on, second verses third?  Anything to avoid? Is the West wing better than North as far as being quieter and more sunlight? I see some rooms overlook the health center, volleyball court and some the quad. Thanks!",

            "comment": "In my experience, it\u2019s not easy to predict which rooms will be quiet, as much will depend on who your neighbors are. I stayed on the second floor of Redwood as a freshman and third as a sophomore. I don\u2019t remember any difference. In my freshman year, the guy across the hall from my room had a drum kit. Other neighbors had guitars. \n\nI assume the gazebo is located in the middle of the quad between Redwood and Sunset? When I lived there, just a year after the dorms were built, the quad was barren, with just patches of grass and a few low shrubs trying to gain a foothold. One night a bunch of us expropriated an outhouse from a farm in the Arcata bottoms and installed it in the quad. The authorities were not pleased!  Needless to say, it is one of my fondest memories of my days in Redwood Hall.",

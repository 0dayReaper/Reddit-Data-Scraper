I have to go to Santa rosa and have for the last 7 yrs to get seen. If you just need a cleaning its worth it to fork it out for a dental student at CR to do it rather than drive 4 hours. If you have an emergency sometimes you can get seen once by someone in town, but you've still gotta be lucky.",

They did an extraction for me on Medi-Cal about 2 years ago when I fell and broke a tooth, but they couldn't provide me any services for even a removable prosthetic.  They also did a deep cleaning when I was pregnant, but I needed a referral from my OB/GYN for it.",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m interested in the environmental resource engineering &amp; or management programs. But I\u2019m having difficulty deciding and I wanted to get some insight from the experiences of students who are already in these programs. \n\nHow is the course load?\n\nAre your professors supportive / engaging to work with? \n\nIs there a robust support network of tutors / office hour time / study groups available for students who might need help with the material? \n\nWhat has been your experience with trying to receive financial aid?  \n\nThanks in advance for any insight, I\u2019m the first person in my family to go to college so I\u2019m navigating almost all of this solo.",

I\u2019m still friends with many of them and we even have class reunions. i even met my wife at HSU. \n\ni\u2019ve been working as an engineer since i graduated and i now work on pretty large scale remediation sites. \n\nnow i know this doesn\u2019t answer your question between ERE or ERM but it\u2019s because ERM wasn\u2019t a thing when i was there. But i would sit down with one of the profs (if Lang or Cashman are still there they are fantastic to talk to about these sorts of things) and tell them what you want and they should help you figure out which direction to take it. all i can say is it\u2019s a great, but difficult program and if you finish it, you have a high chance of being successful. \n\ncheers and good luck and don\u2019t hesitate to dm me if you have more questions.",

I hadn\u2019t taken Thermo yet if i remember correctly. \n\nif you join the clubs (and you should!) such as ERESA, SWE, SHPE, they will start hosting study and informational sessions that will help you determine when you\u2019re ready. They usually invite folks to come through and answer questions and walk you through the process as well. When I took it we car pooled down with a bunch of us and all took it at once. \n\nhope that helps!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in esm, the teachers are pretty great so far! It\u2019s more of a social work type of degree than the ere track, and a lot more focused on fieldwork with existing systems rather than creation or optimization of new ones. In that way, it\u2019s kind of more grunt work than ere. It\u2019s also a good primer to make you a liaison for envi sci and the general public. \nA lot of the core classes are similar/shared between the two subjects, so don\u2019t feel like you\u2019d lose all your progress if you decided to switch later on. However, ere has a LOT more chem and math than esm, so keep that in mind. Honestly, that was one of the big reasons I decided to go with esm. It seems like isn\u2019t even enough time to allow for a minor in four years if you take under 20 credits a semester. That\u2019s just esm\u2019s courseload though, I don\u2019t know about ere.\nThere are tutors available for free at the library for just about anything, I think, so you should be fine on that front regardless.\nScholarships are pretty even across the board, although it seems like internships for esm are easier to find and get. \nAnd ay! It\u2019s nice to see another first gen coming to humboldt! If you\u2019re not already, you should see if you can get into the eop program!! They provide their own grant as long as you\u2019re in the program :)\nHope this helps!",

With a mgmt degree, it will be very difficult to get a job doing engineering. I would assume ERE is more challenging but it doesn\u2019t close any doors so it is worth the effort in my opinion.",

            "comment": "Engineering grad. The majority of the students I started with as a freshman didn\u2019t graduate. You can look up HSU\u2019s retention rates online. They\u2019re not great. It\u2019s heavy in math and chemistry. You need multiple semesters of calculus and chem. Professors are pretty good about office hours. In terms of a robust network of tutors, I think student collaboration is where the program falters. It\u2019s a highly individualistic culture/structure. The courses they offer make you competitive in the job market and you get real world experience through course projects. Hope that helps.",

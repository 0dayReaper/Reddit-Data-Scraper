    "postText": "Hey all. I'm sort of at a loss as to what I should do. I signed up for an online course a while back, and now that we're several days into the semester I still haven't been able to access the class on Canvas. I can see that it's there, just unpublished. I looked up the instructor's email and messaged them the first day of class, though I haven't received any emails or notifications regarding the class prior to the semester starting, now that I think about it. Just in case I had the wrong email, I contacted the respective department and asked them if they could contact the instructor for me to see if maybe it was canceled or something. As of now, I haven't heard from either the instructor or the department. Is there anything else I can do right now? Should I just look for an open class to drop into? Any input would be appreciated!",

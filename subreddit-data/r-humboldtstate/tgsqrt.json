I\u2019m trying my hardest not to flunk out of college, but if i can\u2019t get myself to do the work, i\u2019ve got no chance",

Check your insurance company website to see if they have a provider directory.\n\nCall every relevant provider that is listed as accepting your insurance. If your insurance company has a provider directory, it likely includes telehealth (streamed) professionals who do not live locally. They're kind of a last resort.\n\nYour issue right now won't be finding a good psychiatrist. It will be finding any psychiatrist at all who accepts your insurance. This is an issue in Humboldt County across many types of medical professionals.\n\nYou can also consult [Counseling &amp; Psychological Services](https://counseling.humboldt.edu/department-information) (CAPS) on campus for assistance.",

There is a lot about social communication that is difficult to observe through a screen, most especially body posture, but also, people generally react differently to another person when talking through a screen rather than sitting a few feet away. \n\nFor example, eye contact can be steady through a screen when in person the same person could be looking anywhere except at the therapist, and so on. Social cues are an important clue in therapy and two people interact with each other differently when in person. \n\nI am glad you found great value in telehealth. I am not claiming it is impossible to succeed through telehealth, nor am I dissuading from its use. I am saying in-person therapy is better. It is better for the therapist, and therefore better for the patient. Just my opinion. We agree to disagree.\n\nEDIT: Downvote all you like. Try asking your telehealth therapist which is better. Their answer will be the same. Telehealth for therapy exists for logistical reasons only, unless a client's issue is a phobia about sitting in close proximity to another person and speaking to them.",

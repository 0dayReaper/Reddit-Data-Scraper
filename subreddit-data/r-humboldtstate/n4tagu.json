    "postText": "I have to say, since the university switched to whoever it is that is providing food in the J presently, the quality of food has gone waaaayyyy downhill. The meals aren\u2019t as good. Breakfast is pretty mediocre, lunch isn\u2019t even worth going for more than half the time, and dinner is also pretty mediocre. I\u2019d be pretty mad if I had a food plan and that\u2019s what I was being fed. Hopefully they get better, but I doubt it. They cut so many corners that it\u2019s just a small step up from prison food, and that\u2019s disappointing because it used to be really good.",

One of the main chefs doesn\u2019t want their name attached to the food anymore. They\u2019re given assigned recipes and not allowed to deviate unless they don\u2019t have ingredients. And even then it\u2019s just substitutions. And if people who don\u2019t like it complain, who knows, maybe they\u2019ll let the UC come back. Probably not though. This switch was 100% about money.",

To keep customers (students) and employees happy, an institution must heavily invest in food service. Instead, institutions often overlook the most important social and emotional motivator they have at their disposal. I predict the next president's first major change won't be a revised logo, but a return to local control of its eateries... rebuilding what has been destroyed this school year. Presidents usually stick around to 5 to 10 years, so change will be a long time coming.",

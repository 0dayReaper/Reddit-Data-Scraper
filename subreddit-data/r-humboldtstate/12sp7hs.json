If you keep your windows open all the time, you get the fresh air but it could get a bit chilly, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to warrant bringing a small heater (you can go under your blankets or put on a sweater and be fine). My room gets stuffy when we have the windows closed and the heating is on, so like I know some people who have a fan, but I would just open the windows to let the cold air in.",

Dehumidifiers are large and noisy and you wouldn't be anyone's favorite roommate trying to run one. Plus, you kind of defeat the purpose of having a dehumidifier given the number of times you'd be opening your door to the hallway, exchanging your room air with air from elsewhere. If you did run one, your room would get super warm super quick. They generate a good amount of heat and you'd want to wear noise-canceling headphones (the type for when using a leaf blower) to protect your hearing.",

It seems even less likely after Housing locked down the thermostats to control them.\n\n&gt;I don\u2019t know how you haven\u2019t heard of mold issues since everyone in the chat is saying have a dehumidifier? \n\nI didn't read in the thread that anyone had a dehumidifier in their room. I participated in that discussion, which started with someone suggesting it's a good idea, and then revolved around whether the idea was practical given how loud they are and how warm they make a room... I'm quite dubious of the user(s) who claimed they don't make considerable noise. And the heat they generate would make a small dorm room unbearable for me.",

If there's mold there now, then something has changed.\n\nI worked three summers on the cleaning crew that cleaned every single dorm room after students left (and recorded new damage that supposedly occurred during your stay that you didn't write on your check-in form). And then our cleaning crew continued to clean the dorms as they were used by traveling guests who are on campus for various conferences and symposiums during the summer. 40 hours a week, every week, during the summer. We even placed white towels and mini soap bars in the rooms like they were hotel rooms.\n\nI was quite literally familiar with every nook and cranny of those rooms, because we cleaned every inch, and there was no mold anywhere at the end of the school year.\n\nThat's Canyon, Cypress, The Hill, The Manor, and Creekview in the 1990s.

Most nights were perfectly comfortable, if I ever got hot I\u2019d just open my window for a bit and the room would cool instantly. I had a fan but used it maybe once. Honestly, I\u2019d wait until you get here and then hit up target if you decide you need a fan or heater. DEFINITELY get a small dehumidifier though (nice for white nose too) :)",

    "postText": "I'll be transferring to Humboldt for Fall '23 and I'll be living off campus with a roommate. I'm pretty nervous about finding housing, especially since we have cats as well. When do you all think I should start looking at and applying for places? I was planning to take a trip in mid May to look at places in person, but should I be applying online sooner than that? \n\nI'm betting it'll be easiest to find a place at the end of the semester but from what I've heard it goes quick. I'm open to any advice, thanks!",

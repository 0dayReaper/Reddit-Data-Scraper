I had only half of a project worth a third of my grade done and I didn't start finishing it until hours before it was due. Right now I'm feeling a bit better (still majorly procrastinating) but this semester has been one of the hardest I've endured. Despite all the stress and the BS I know we can all do it! Good luck to everybody we are almost done!",

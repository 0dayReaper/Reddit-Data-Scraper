Please sign and share everywhere you can all over social media. Administration isn\u2019t listening us or our faculty. Let\u2019s do this! [Delay Face to Face instruction at HSU](https://chng.it/SGvz4TFBHg)\n\nEDIT: Please see the petition for the update. The Dean of Students has been contacted and given the petition along with current signatures and demands. The number of signers continues to rise. Stay safe! We\u2019re all in this together!",

[CDC chart here](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/understanddifferenceinfographic-508.pdf)\n\nEdit: my bad, there are totally n95 type masks given out, but they usually run out and/or it\u2019s the blue surgical/HSU branded masks that are out the most.",

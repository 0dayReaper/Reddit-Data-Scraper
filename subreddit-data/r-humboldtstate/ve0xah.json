            "comment": "Unless you are planning to do video editing or intensive gaming, almost any laptop will suffice. You might want it to handle MS Office okay, but could certainly get by using Google's free office suite, which is free and used through a web browser.\n\nMost manufacturer warranties are for 1 year. Unless you're going to buy an extended warranty, consider buying from Costco or Costco.com (no membership needed to buy certain things from the website) because [Costco extends the warranty to a second year](https://concierge.costco.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1001211) on computers, excluding touchscreen tablets. \n\nNote that warranties cover hardware failures, not operating system problems, so be sure to create rescue media (on DVD or USB stick) soon after you boot your PC for the first time. The rescue media will help you restore your PC to factory defaults (but erase your hard drive in the process). \n\nSo, you may want to invest in cloud storage that automatically saves your files online so you lose nothing if your hard drive dies. Google Suite files are automatically saved in your Google account.",

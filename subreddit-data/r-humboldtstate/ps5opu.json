I\u2019m debating applying for housing on campus ( do they match you with roommates at random? ) or doing an off campus approach. I\u2019ve heard housing is limited in both aspects and wanted to hear what others have done or are planning to do :-)",

            "comment": "If you want to move off campus in spring 2022 you should be actively looking for housing now. Living on campus is a nice way to get accustomed to campus and meet people. But most of the time you are sharing a room with someone. And you\u2019ll be living the real college life (no real cooking space, very limited privacy, RA\u2019s making sure your following the rules and such)  both have positives and negatives. I lived on campus for a year. It wasn\u2019t too bad. But as a 23 year old it gets kinda old not being able to really cook or have privacy.",

If possible, you should try to get some roommates and rent a house as it looks like they're easier to get than apartments. If not, living on campus isn't bad, they house transfers and upperclassmen with each other so you won't be in a freshman dorm",

If you apply for housing starting in the fall semester, you are given the opportunity to find flatmates in the roommate finder, but in spring they'll probably try to fit you in wherever they can, which almost definitely means you'll be sharing a room.\n\nHowever! Offcampus housing is difficult to find and usually expensive. Because so many people in Northern California lost homes to fires, there has been an influx of people looking for housing, and a lot of those people have come to Arcata/Eureka. That's specifically why campus has been so tight on housing, because the usual offcampus housing market is saturated with fire refugees. You may be able to find something offcampus but it will definitely be more expensive than campus housing.",

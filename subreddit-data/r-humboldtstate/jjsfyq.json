    "postText": "Does anyone have any tips on how to decide a major??\n\nI transferred to HSU as a Kinesiology major since I thought I wanted to be a physical therapist. But jesus christ after this semester, I don't like it at all. The professors are all great people but I realized I'm just not interested in this subject at all. Maybe because it's all online but it's just not interesting to me.\n\nI always thought I would do physical therapy but, now I'm in a dilemma. I don't know what to do. I would like to change my major before the next semester so that I don't have to stay for an extra year or two. \n\nI'm taking a journalism course which is the only class I find interesting. So, I might like to change it to that. On the other hand, someone I know has a business and they're in need of a new accountant and would like to hire someone they already know. Basically I would already have a job set for me after school and I'd be working from home if I take up accounting \n\nI'm just not sure what to do now if anyone has any advice it would really help!!!\n\nEdit: thanks guys for all the help! I changed my major to Accounting since like some of you said there will always be a job waiting unlike journalism",

You're about to take on a bunch of debt to learn something that will hopefully lead to being paid well for your time, relative to the pay you're earning without a degree.\n\nIf the pay you're looking at post-BA is not much different than what you could earn today, choose a different major. I know people who graduated from the journalism program at HSU, are working professionally in the local area, and are making slightly less money than a full-time, dispensary budtender.",

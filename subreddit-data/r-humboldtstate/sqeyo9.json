    "postText": "So I love the friends I\u2019ve made at Humboldt, but some of the classes were too hard for me. My second semester of freshman year was shit. I didn\u2019t talk to anyone and my mental health was poor. I slept all day and cried like all the time. I took the following semester off and ran out of time to do the same this semester. Now I need a serious and compelling reason to drop out. Has anyone dropped out before or are planning to? I legit can\u2019t pay for this semester. I didn\u2019t even enroll for classes.",

Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. Reach out to your friends, they probably miss you and want to see you more.\n\nIf you end up continuing at HSU, get in touch with the mental health department. You have 4 free sessions a semester, but if you need it, your therapist will get you more free sessions. My first semester up here I had my car stolen in a horrible way, led to a lot of anxiety and it was very beneficial. They also have a psychiatrist if they think you could benefit from medication. Good luck with everything buddy, you got this!",

It\u2019s okay if you graduate later than you originally wanted. I have had to take time off for physical and mental health reasons. I am graduating this semester at age 26. You\u2019ll get there. When you decide you want to go back to school you can always consider a community college (Humboldt county has College of the Redwoods), which will be cheaper or even free. You can always work and take classes at a community college part time. I am wishing you the best!! Take care.",

It will always be there and you can always come back (I\u2019m finally graduating this semester after 10 years on and off). But if you wanna stay Humboldt has a lot of resources. It\u2019ll take some emails, calls and a little bit of paperwork.. but you can handle it. \n\nI\u2019ve utilized CARES to help me out when I\u2019ve had extenuating circumstances so I can get some extensions on certain assignments.\n\nCAPS is a great resource if you\u2019d like some therapy\u2026 it\u2019s always nice to speak with someone.\n\nAnd SDRC (student resource disability center) can help give you accommodations for classes (using phones to record/take notes, leaving class if you need, etc)",

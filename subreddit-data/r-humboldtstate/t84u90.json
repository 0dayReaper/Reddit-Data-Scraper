It comes every first and third weekend of the month. It's been pretty helpful when I needed groceries or something that wasn't available on campus or in the surrounding area. There's a farmer's market every weekend about a 15 minute walk from campus that sells pretty cool stuff. People in Arcata have been quite kind to me, those in Eureka a little less so. It gets a little sketchy at night out here off campus. Oh and the paths and surrounding forest near campus are beautiful so you'll definitely enjoy that. \n\nIf you get a meal plan the food at The J is only good about 50% of the time and is usually flavorless. You can use Flex Dollars at other eating places on campus which are way better.",

The bus schedules aren't especially pleasant, and it always pays to have friends who own a car.\n\nAlso read [my reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/humboldtstate/comments/t84u90/anything_i_should_know_before_i_go_to_humboldt/hzmw6y1/) about the local political climate. I know a trans high school student who came out in 9th grade. While her experience wasn't perfect, it wasn't dreadful either.  There are some bigots everywhere. She has staff support and friends. I know a trans elementary school student who is supported and accepted at the elementary school level. Both students live outside Arcata in supposedly conservative areas.",

I bring it up as a local myself because a lot of students from SoCal actually get upset by strangers greeting them on the street or smiling at them or offering help if it looks like you need it. So dont be surprised if a casual \"sup\" in passing  becomes a conversation. Or if you're having car trouble and a stranger appears amd offers to take a look or give you a jump. You're likely to develop casual friendships with most service workers if you go to tue same places. Wait staff will remember you and what you order after a while. Just he aware that people are nice amd chatty here and its typically genuine.",

A lot of them are nice, but especially at night it\u2019s good to be careful if you\u2019re walking around Arcata. There was a stabbing recently, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s better to be safe then sorry.\n\nGood shoes and a good jacket (it\u2019s normally in the fifties/sixties here but the ocean makes it feel colder) are necessary. Practice walking steep stairs if you can, you\u2019ll be doing a lot of that. Hills as well. Make sure your stamina is more then ready. I\u2019m from Central California and I was struck pretty immediately by the change in the air. It\u2019s very wet and heavy compared to other parts of California and that can effect your stamina, especially in the first couple weeks. \n\nNot sure if it\u2019s going to be a problem for you any time soon, but just in general avoid campus apartments. Moldy ceilings, shitty heater, that weird glass door, no windows - just a bad place to live all together. And don\u2019t leave your freshman dorm room without looking where you\u2019re walking, you may very well step in vomit or urine. Don\u2019t use the drinking fountains in freshman housing, drunk people will urinate in it at some point.",

McKinleyville arguably has more liberal representation on the board of supervisors than Arcata (McKinleyville has no city council). Eureka has a Democrat-majority on its city council. The county consistently has a majority vote for Democrats in statewide and national elections. Hell, [Eureka returned city-owned land to the Wiyot Tribe](https://www.northcoastjournal.com/humboldt/were-coming-home/Content?oid=12849841) against the griping of the local oligarch.\n\nI'll grant you that looking at Facebook community watch groups you'd get a different impression of local cities, because those groups attract some pretty nasty people who are shocked, shocked I tell you!, that conservatives keep losing local elections.\n\n2)  The KKK thing is an urban myth that lacks even a scrap of evidence. Both local newspapers and law enforcement have looked into it in the past. The myth usually goes that there is a KKK chapter in McKinleyville. Nope. Are there racist people all over the county? Yes. Are there racist people all over America? Yes. \n\n3) The county and city are disinterested in homeless issues? What? They can always do more, but [come on](https://humboldtgov.org/2512/Humboldt-Housing-Homeless-Coalition).\n\nYour wages observation is spot on, but that's America writ large. Half of all Americans are low income or living in poverty. Welcome to late stage capitalism. Or, said in another way, welcome to the oligarchy.",

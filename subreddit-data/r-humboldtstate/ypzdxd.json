I love my fair share of sunny weather and snowy winters.\n\nAlso, where do people ski? Mt. Shasta?",

            "comment": "I moved to Arcata for HSU in 2020 from South Lake Tahoe. I never got used to the lack sunshine. I did manage to stay and graduated this past May though. \n\nIt\u2019s a tough place to move to and get established. However, it\u2019s not impossible. I lived off campus my whole two years and the rental market is an absolute nightmare. \n\nI rode Mt. Shasta a few times while I was there, and it\u2019s actually a great mountain for its size. It\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s a four hour drive from Arcata on 299. 299 is not like 395 or 80 to get up to the basin from Reno. It\u2019s a two lane \u2018highway\u2019 that is often not well maintained, so day trips to ride turned into overnight trips more than once for me. \n\nYou can also go up to Ashland, OR to ski at Mt. Ashland and it takes about the same (maybe 30 minutes more) to get there. \n\nI have mixed emotions about my time and education in Humboldt. Wasn\u2019t great, but also wasn\u2019t terrible. One of the biggest things that you need to be OK with moving there is the remoteness of Humboldt. The airport is tiny and expensive and flights are often canceled due to the fog. To get to Sacramento it\u2019ll take you five hours to get to San Francisco it will take you five hours. I found being this far from large cities to be challenging at times. \n\nThis is just my experience and I recognize a large chunk of it was through Covid and that probably impacted some of my views. There\u2019s a lot of beauty there and some decent people sprinkled throughout the county.\n\nI should add that I moved back to Tahoe three months after graduation. \n\nGood luck in your decision!",

            "comment": "Born and mostly raised here.\n\nFirst thing is first:\n\nGet yourself some really nice chilly weather clothes, not COLD, just chilly. Some comfortable sweaters, beanies, scarves, thermals (upper and lower), flannels, thick socks, long sleeve shirts that fit snugly, good boots, etc. Having the correct clothes makes the gloomy chilly weather kinda nice because you aren't likely to get sunburned or get all sweaty or need to pack around a bottle of water to fight off dehydration. If you just have normal summer clothes and throw on a winter coat you will still be cold, the humid wind chill will cut right through your shoes, pants, and up the sleeves/down the neck and hood of your coat. Look at what people in the Scotland/Ireland wear year round, it's a similarly dreary and moist, they have it figured out, and if you have the money the Irish shop in old town eureka has some of the nicest chilly weather clothes in the area.\n\nYou will be much more comfortable and happy in flannel/fleece lined jeans, cotton socks, leather boots, a tight long sleeve shirt covered with a knit sweater or thick flannel and a beanie than you will be in pretty much anything else from October-May, throw on a plastic rain coat when its raining hard enough, or if you need to be out in the light rain long enough (bring an extra pair of socks in your backpack/purse just in case, nothing worse than wet feet)\n\nUmbrellas will kinda work, but a good rain coat and boots will work better because the wind, often if you are going to keep your head dry it will be at the expense of the rest of your body with an umbrella.\n\nSecond:\n\nSeasonal Affective Disorder is a thing for some people and Vitamin D supplements help. They don't cost very much and they can be a big difference for a lot of people when the sun goes away. Exercise is important and can be difficult when the weather gets like this, so find some good indoor exercise options unless you love to exercise in the cold rain. Personally I enjoy the indoor climbing gym in Arcata, its better when its a bit cold because it can get pretty miserable inside there in the summer.\n\nThird:\n\nThe biggest thing I dislike about the weather here is the lack of a proper winter, winter is just a slightly colder part of the fall/spring weather. It will feel like it has been the same weather for an eternity by the time June comes around and it suddenly switches back to summer mode. Take a trip to the snow, sounds like skiing is of interest so I recommend not just planning a day trip (because often you will just get stranded if you try it) and get some friends together and pitch in for an air bnb where you want to ski. Shasta is pretty good, Ashland has been pretty bad the few times I have gone there (icy and steep, not my favorite combo).\n\nFlights in and out during the winter can sometimes get re-routed, but have been a lot better in recent years than historically thanks to some renovations at the airport, we have had people fly in for Christmas the last few years and its not been an issue yet, and we have direct flights to Denver round trip for like $150 if you get them at the right time, where you can easily take a rental or a shuttle to some world class skiing.",

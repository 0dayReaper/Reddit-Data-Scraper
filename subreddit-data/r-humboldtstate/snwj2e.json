    "postText": "I was accepted for fall 2022 at Humboldt. I am still considering my other choices and other schools, but right now Humboldt is looking like my cheapest option. I have a few questions if any current students could answer since I haven\u2019t been able to visit the campus etc! \n\n1. As a freshman I have to get a meal plan, which meal plan would you say is the cheapest but most worthwhile one? I have been looking at lumberjack 75 for cost haha. \n\n2. Which residential housing option is best? Should I do doubles or triples? \n\n3. If anyone has any advice I\u2019d totally appreciate it!! I\u2019m first generation and I really have no idea what I\u2019m doing it just taking it a step at a time.\n\nThank you!!",

            "comment": "The meal plan you select is heavily influenced by the residence hall you reside in. Some residence halls are almost like living in an apartment where you cook most meals. Other residence halls have so many students for a single kitchen that you'll be eating almost exclusively at the cafeteria (\"The J\" in the Jolly Giant Commons). Those residence halls are located very close to The J for that reason, because the halls located near The J were conceived as a single complex, a sort of resident community where everyone ate at the cafeteria. Decades later the university began building more residence halls in other areas of the campus.\n\nI would prefer a double instead of a triple.",

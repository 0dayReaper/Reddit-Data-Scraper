If you have a parent immersed in a parents-whose-kids-are-going-to-college Facebook group, view all of Mom or Dad's proposed extras with a skeptical eye. It amazes me how much crap an over-involved parent is capable of wanting to bring for their child's room.\n\n4.

That draws a lot of attention to whatever it is you are locking up though.\n\n5. After you settle in, if you realize there is something you need, there is always Target in Eureka, or Amazon.",

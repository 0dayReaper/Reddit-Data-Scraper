I\u2019m moving up to Arcata in August and I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t be able to find the same kind of deal. I know there\u2019s bulk for food at co-ops but I know nothing of refills for hygiene and cleaning products. Anyone know of anything like this near campus?",

It's the only one I'm personally familiar with but the community here is very green and I wouldn't be surprised if there are more options.",

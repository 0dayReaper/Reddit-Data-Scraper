    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman whose gonna be living on campus starting fall 2022. I see a lot of mixed information regarding bringing a car to campus. \n\nIt's mainly staff who say it's not recommended but I've seen more students say that having a car is worth it for travelling to the beach, into town, etc. \n\nI'm assuming that parking is horrible, will there be a place to park if I'm an on campus resident or is it mainly street parking?\n\nLet me know what your recommendation is, plus any other advice you may have for an incoming freshman. Thank you!",

Everything in town is accessible by walking, but if you want to go to Eureka or beyond having a car will be ideal.  Transportation out of the area for going home on the holidays is also very limited.  \n\nAt least in 07 and 08 parking was easy with a residential parking pass, the lot by The J always had open spots.  Parking is more of an issue if you live off campus and drive to campus for the day.",

I only did it few times and honestly could have walked to campus and still made it in the same time as it took me to drive and finally find a spot.  Fortunately OP was wondering about residential parking which gets easier once daily commuters go home.  \n\nIf bus passes are still included with student fees, find a legal parking place near campus and hop on the bus and ride it up to campus.  Just don\u2019t rely on getting a ride from the last stop on the route, if it\u2019s dumping rain everyone rides the bus and the drivers would skip the last stop if the bus was too full, even if people were waiting.",

Don't leave campus Monday through Friday with your car anytime after 7am unless you plan on coming back around 5pm or 6pm which is when the lots start to clear up. On the weekends and breaks the lots are usually clear and you can park in general and staff general parking, just as long as you get back to a resident spot by Monday morning.",

You can walk downtown no problem or go into the forest without driving from campus, but if you want to have a job or be able to go on an adventure on your own, the bus(while free for students) can be limited by where it can go. Uber isn't really a thing here, there are taxis, but they are limited. I sold my car before moving here, because my Fiance has a car that we share, and I regret selling my car. It would have made life so much easier having it up here.\r  \n\r  \nThe parking situation is really not too bad, it really depends on the dorm that you live on campus. I lived in Creekview and the parking was always packed, because it was limited, but if you are gonna be living near the J or College Creek there will be a large parking lot that will fill up during the school day, but be half full to a third full past 5 pm.\r  \n\r  \nSo long that you can afford having it with you, I would recommend that you bring it.",

Parking is super bad on campus for non dorm parking and yeah, they sell more permits than there are spaces, which doesn\u2019t exactly help the issue. Plus you\u2019ll likely want to go to target, Walmart or Costco for dorm stuff and you\u2019ll cover the gas if you give a ride to your dorm mates here and there. There\u2019s a bus system around town and in to Eureka but it can take a while and if you\u2019re trying to lug around shopping it\u2019s not super convenient.\nEdit- the street parking bordering campus has meters or certain hourly restrictions so it\u2019s possible to park off campus if the J lot is full but just mind the signs and be prepared to move your car if you have to do it one afternoon or something.",

Even now that I have a car, I barely ever use it, as I still enjoy walking everywhere, more. There are shuttles, buses, and taxis if you ever need to get to Eureka or the airport, but Arcata is so great that I hardly ever find myself wanting to go anywhere else in the county.

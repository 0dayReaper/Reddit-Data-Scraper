Books and supplies quote is a joke unless you actually learn through a textbook. It\u2019s more like 50-250 for the whole year on supplies depending on your classes.",

If you\u2019re able to rent a room for $600 a month, add in utilities, and you\u2019d be eating pretty sparse for  the $200 you have left in the month.",

I\u2019m a business major and spend around $200 to $300 on textbooks per semester. Around $300 for food (I shop at winco). It really depends on if you live on or off campus.",

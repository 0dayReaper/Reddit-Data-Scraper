            "comment": "I actually loved it. The professors have some high standards in what you should know, but that is a good thing in my opinion. I ended up not going all the way through with my Oceanography major, but that was for personal reasons. It was difficult, though I think most of that was because I was not able to put in the work for it. As a surfer and lifeguard I thought I was going to make it through easy, I know the ocean. Or so I thought. The Coral Sea is the boat we went out on to do research, and that was always enjoyable. The professors really love their craft, and it shows. Once I started not doing well in their classes, THEY actually pulled me aside to talk about personal instruction in their office hours. Its people who really love what they do, and love teaching others about it. I didn't end up going with an Oceanography degree, though it was def one of the most memorable parts of my college experience.",

Plus the low student to teach ratio at HSU is nice, and most major courses in oceanography tend to be 30 folks or less, so it's easy to get to know your professors.",

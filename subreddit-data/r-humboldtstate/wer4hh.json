I lived in sunset and would just walk over to Nelson hall since those are always empty! So if you are willing to walk a little bit I\u2019d recommend doing that if you have anxiety!",

Keep in mind everyone\u2019s schedule varies so it\u2019s not like the whole floor is going to be pooping at the same time. I don\u2019t really recall ever having to wait for a toilet or a shower, maybe on a Friday night if everyone was trying to get out to something?",

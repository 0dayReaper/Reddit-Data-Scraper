Could anyone who\u2019s lived in cypress tell me about your experience?\nIs the kitchen and bathrooms a decent size? Is the living room pretty crowded?\nAlso what\u2019s the point of having a kitchen if we have to get a meal plan? Any and all information would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance",

            "comment": "Hello! I moved to cypress from canyon my 2nd semester at HSU and I enjoyed it much more. To me the biggest upsides were the private bathrooms and living room space. Privacy is always an excellent thing and I especially appreciated not having to listen to someone else's (or in some cases multiple people's) music whenever I was showering. The living room is terrific for getting some friends over or your floor mates for some movie nights or smash bros, as long as someone brought a TV. There was usually a lot of general hanging out in there or the back patio. I lived on the bottom floor so I did have to conquer the entirety of the stairs every day going to class so my experience with them may differ from yours since I don't know how \"in shape\" you are. Personally I'm not and I got used to it fairly easily. As for the kitchen, yeah you have a meal plan, but let's say the J is closed and you really want hot food that you bought from the giant's cupboard that needs to be heated up in the oven or something (I honestly forget if cypress kitches have microwaves provided), then that's where it can come in handy. Also it has a refrigerator so if you want to take leftovers from the J and heat them up later you can. I didn't use mine too much but I do believe the kitchen can come in clutch.\n\nCypress isn't perfect though, my freshman year we had to provide our own toilet paper which is insane considering it's provided in most of the other dorms. I think maybe they provide it now but I could easily be wrong. Another downside is noise, at least in my experience compared to canyon. I lived with some pretty wild people in cypress and they frequently congregated in the living room or kitchen at night and stayed up late. I value getting a full night's sleep, at least on school nights and the sound can carry a little too well from the living room. My roommate many a time had to tell our floor mates to shut the hell up which usually worked. The other major downside to cypress is that it is your responsibility to keep the whole suite clean. If you or your floor mates fail to tidy things up by move out then you will definitely not get your full deposit back. My floor mates broke a cabinet but were kind enough to chip some money in for those who were clearly not at fault.\n\nThat being said I still very much enjoyed cypress and would recommend it as it's slightly closer to living in an apartment than canyon or the hill. Floor mates will be a gamble as with any dorm, but the best thing you can do for them and yourself is to try and get to know them. If things don't work out for one reason or another, I do believe you can request a room swap through housing.\n\nEdit: If you live on the 4th or 5th floor or higher then you will have a washer and dryer in your suite which I think is incredibly convenient albeit you have to share just one washer and dryer with your whole suite",

Yes I'm old.\n\nAnyways, I generally enjoyed it, but if at all possible I would highly recommend NOT getting a room on the very bottom level. Every other floor has skylights and decent amount of sun, while the bottom floor has a hedge in front of its windows, and no skylight or anything. It also was just constantly a bit damper than the rest of cypress.",

            "comment": "Cypress was a fairly pleasant experience and compared to the other dorms nearby were the most comfortable to be in. Overall the only complaint I have was how much you had to use stairs to go anywhere, but that\u2019s pretty common at HSU overall. Also the kitchens are fairly nice and spacious, really allowing everyone to be able to have their own food. Which is handy for those days you don\u2019t want to eat at the J or Depot.",

            "comment": "The Cypress rooms are pretty smushed together and you can hear EVERYTHING that goes on in the other rooms. Definitely establish a quiet time with your roommates beforehand. The kitchen and living room are pretty decent, and you want a kitchen in case the J's food isn't appealing that day or if you want to eat in the morning on weekends.",

            "comment": "Cypress has evolved over time. In my era, residents were required to clean the common areas and communal bathroom themselves. The year I stayed there, this had tragically bad results. I believe the very next year they began having a staff housekeeper tend to Cypress like was done with the other residence halls at that time.\n\nAlso in my era, people rarely used the kitchen because, like you noted, there is a meal plan and you live smack dab next to the cafeteria in the Jolly Giant Commons (the JGC, or \"The J\"). \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if, *before* my time, Cypress was for upperclassmen as the only apartment experience on campus. Quite a few residence halls have been built since then.\n\nThe kitchen is decently sized for an apartment and there is an adjoining dining area separate from the living room. The living room is plenty big enough. \n\nHere is HSU's [page about Cypress](https://housing.humboldt.edu/options/cypress). It includes floor plans and 360 degree views of some rooms.",

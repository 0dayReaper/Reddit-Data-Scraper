    "postText": "Really miss those weird, precious years in Arcata. Pint night at the Toby and Jacks. IPAs were $1 and double IPAs were $2 (wonder what the prices are now?). Getting chased by douchebag university police through the redwood forest for smoking weed outside Founders Hall. The hundred of walks up that insanely steep hill called Granite Avenue (it once snowed and we were all trapped). Moonstone beach at midnight. Endless foggy summer days. Staying in Raymond Carver\u2019s old house next to Wildberries on G street. Dropping crab pots off the pier in Trinidad and hitting the casino. Just how fucking weird everyone was. Nothing made sense and everything was beautiful.",

Our freshman year, some of our friend group (all queer) ended up on the 1st floor of the dorm. The entrance level was floor 2, so we had higher windows and were partially below ground.  \nAs the school year went on, we all ended up moving down to the first floor. There weren't many rooms on this floor, due to the dorm storage and some other facilities. There were a total of 13 students on the floor, and 10 of us were queer.  We lovingly referred to our floor as \"the gay basement.\"",

Additionally, roommates who do not report unauthorized pets can be held equally \nresponsible for fines and damages incurred. \n \n&gt;Residents must arrange for the care and feeding of pets during Cal Poly Humboldt break periods and any other time when they will be away for an extended period. You cannot provide your key card to have someone look after your animal while you are away. Please note that electrical outages \u2013 which will affect aquarium pumps and equipment \u2013 these outages may be planned during vacation periods if maintenance work needs to be completed. \n\nSource: [ResLife &amp; You Handbook](https://housing.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/handbook.pdf)",

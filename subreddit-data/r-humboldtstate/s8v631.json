    "postText": "On January 18th Humboldt State University reported 114 new COVID-19 cases among HSU students and employees amidst as in-person classes are happening at HSU. It's shocking how HSU officials are allowing majority of in-person instruction to continue and aren't considering temporary virtual learning like how the fourteen* CSU campuses have done to prevent the potential surge of COVID-19.\n\nhttps://campusready.humboldt.edu/guide/health-safety#rates\n\n\nA COVID surge is happening in Humboldt County with over 3,500 cases since the start of 2022. \nHumboldt County's Public Health Officer Dr. Ian Hoffman has stated during a press briefing, on January 20th, that \u201cwe\u2019re still not at the peak yet\u201d of the overwhelmingly new cases of COVID-19 outbreaks because of the highly infectious omicron variant. \n\nhttps://www.times-standard.com/2022/01/19/covid-humboldt-county-reports-3500-cases-in-2022-and-were-still-not-at-the-peak-yet\n\nA Change.org petition was started for the University to delay in-person instruction. \n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/humboldt-state-university-administration-delay-the-start-of-face-to-face-instruction-at-hsu-to-protect-students-and-faculty\n\nMembers of the California Faculty Assocation have asked Humboldt State University officials to rethink it's in-person instruction because of the infectious omicron COVID variant. \nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.times-standard.com/2022/01/15/covid-hsu-faculty-union-decries-return-to-in-person-instruction-amid-omicron-surge/amp/",

If you have specific questions, feel free to email me.  I bet you can find my email address; let that be your first research project for Humboldt ESM!",

You'll meet some seriously cool folks that work in the area. Awesome field trips. Good camaraderie amongst students. FUN! You can tailor your class schedule to classes you actually want to take, as long as you advocate for yourself to your advisor. I was able to switch some classes out for others so I could focus on my interests (botany). Plant taxonomy will kick your ass but it was one of my favorite classes. Professors are highly accessible and very happy to help you during their office hours. All in all, I had a fantastic experience in the eco resto concentration.",

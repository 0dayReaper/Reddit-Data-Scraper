            "comment": "I highly doubt legalization has anything to do with it. I strongly considered going to Humboldt before coming to UC Davis. The only thing that seemed to be lacking was a rigorous education/program that was unique to the campus and would secure me for tomorrow\u2019s economy . In my opinion , Humboldt easily has the most natural beauty of any of the cal states , and I would even go as far to say that it has more beauty than the UCs (again, in terms of natural beauty ). People who harp Santa Cruz\u2019s redwoods have obviously not set foot onto humboldts campus . Old growth &gt; new growth\n\nI met a lot of people here at Davis in the plant science/agricultural sciences/biology who considered humboldt but decided Davis and never looked back. Davis is flat and feels suburban, but their plant sciences is a powerhouse and they integrate a lot of classical science with the cutting edge fields of genomics. There\u2019s room for everyone. Also, research opportunities + robust grad school culture attracts a lot of ambitious transfers/freshman . \n\nFrom my understanding , Humboldt does have certain strong branches but it\u2019s not nearly as well rounded. It does lack a modern touch to it or a breadth of courses that would net a broader pool of talent.",

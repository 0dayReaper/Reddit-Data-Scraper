    "postText": "So our dining facility is being privatized and being run by a company called Chartwells. I was reading that they were fired from NYU this year for botching dining for students in [covid isolation](https://nyunews.com/opinion/2020/09/01/nyu-chartwells-controversy/) and they are reportedly stealing from poor children in the UK [twitter link](https://twitter.com/Munchbunch87/status/1348747916563918849?s=19)\n\nSo... This seems terrible.",

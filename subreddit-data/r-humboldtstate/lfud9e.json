    "postText": "Little backstory, I applied to Humboldt State as a transfer for politcal science major, on Dec 15, but while my college sent my official transcript as soon as grades were posted and it was shown as received on the portal that same day, my high school did not send my transcript  until Jan 8 when school returned (it had been requested Dec. 20). I got an email from Parchment that it had been received by HSU but it wasn't set to received on my portal until Jan 21. \n\nHow long after it said that the admission file was ready for admission evaluation did you have to wait to find out whether  you were accepted/conditionally accepted/rejected? Should I just take the lack of update and how long the process took for the HS transcript took to update as a sign that I am going to get rejected? I'm just wondering especially because I see that the inital housing stuff is starting and I'm from Los Angeles so I'm depending on on-campus housing but have no access to it since I'm still under review.",

The lack of admission evaluation doesn\u2019t mean you were rejected. It means most likely they haven\u2019t gotten to you yet or are waiting for some paperwork to come in. But as far as I\u2019ve heard, hsu is and has been needy for students. \n\nRemember while other schools have multiple people working admissions. I believe there\u2019s only one person who evaluates transfer admissions.",

            "comment": "Humboldt's Industrial Technology program was closed about 20 years ago. It was the most successful program in terms of alumni finding careers in their degree field, and in terms of alumni giving. It turned out a lot of graduates who became general contractors or worked in construction, and that's a job field that will always be in need and pay well.\n\nWhy close the program? Aging equipment, retiring professors, and budget cuts. The university has a history of closing successful programs during temporary tough times instead of spreading the burden in small pieces among all departments.\n\n[College of the Redwoods](https://www.redwoods.edu/), the community college system on the north coast, has a [woodworking lab](https://www.redwoods.edu/cte/ct/lab) in south Eureka. Its courses are found within the [Construction Technology program](https://www.redwoods.edu/cte/ct). Here is [last year's course catalog entry](https://redwoods.elumenapp.com/catalog/2021-2022/department,ct#mainContent). I didn't find the coming year's catalog.\n\nCR used to manage the [Krenov School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVs30Ly1WCY) of woodworking in Fort Bragg (Mendocino County), but Krenov has transferred to another community college system.",

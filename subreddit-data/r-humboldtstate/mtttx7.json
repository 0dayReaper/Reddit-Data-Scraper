So far from looking the ones with the 2 at the end have 3 people each living in their own room.1s only have 2 people living in their own rooms.",

IIRC Single 2 is in the back of the suite, Double 2 is next to it, opening from a little hallway by the kitchen and one of the bathrooms, and Single 1/Double 1 open from near the living room area and the other bathroom.\n\nDo take this with a grain of salt, I've only ever been inside as a visitor to study, and it was a while ago.  :)",

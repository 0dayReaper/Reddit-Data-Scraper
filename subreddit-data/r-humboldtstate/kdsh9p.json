If you stick to Humboldt or another Cal state it'll probably be fine, but my Oldest sister got an art education major at a private school... over 80k in loans and she only makes 25k/year.... she works as a elementary school art teacher/librarian, so she will basically never be able to pay back her loans since she doesn't make enough to pay above the interest. But good luck!!",

            "comment": "hello! I just transferred to HSU this fall semester to join the art ed program. I can't say too much because I haven't been here long and everything has been online. So far though, I love it. The professor, Jim, is really great. He cares about the subject and cares about his students, and he was extremely accommodating with all the craziness this semester. It's also great because the program is kind of built to accommodate a double major so many of us are studio art/art education double major, which imo makes the tuition stretch a little further. Also at HSU there are lots of opportunities for community engagement/volunteering which kind of goes hand in hand with the program. (I say this because my community college didn't really have many opportunities so it was a big difference.) \n\nI have only been here for one semester but so far we have done a lot. We have made lesson plans in groups and by ourselves. We looked at education ideas and also state and federal education policies. You should definitely talk to James Woglom if you want to hear more about it, but imo it has been worth the move (I am from SoCal so it was a big move hahaha).\n\nAlso, to the other commenter's point, art education degrees can be expensive but with CSU tuition rates and Humboldt rent prices it becomes much more doable.",

Once I applied and got in there was an art department (including art ed, studio art, and art history) Q&amp;A session on Zoom that I found super informative. But in the meantime, you could honestly email an art professor. They're all so nice :\\^) Good luck!",

Graduates are letting landlords know that they are leaving so there will be lots of openings, but the housing market here is ridiculous. I moved here a decade ago and had to rent an entire month before I got here just to secure the place, and things now are significantly worse than they were then. \n\nBut! Cal Poly Humboldt has an [off-campus housing person](https://housing.humboldt.edu/resident-resources/off-campus) that should be able to help. It's not much of an in to the market, but it's an in and you will definitely benefit from having one.",

I\u2019ve heard private landlords are better than the rental companies? But most everyone I know whether they have a house or not looked for housing for at least 3 months applying and to no avail. It also depends where you want to live, it\u2019s harder in my observation, to get approved to live in arcata and mckinleyville than it is in Eureka. When my roommates moved to eureka they were homeless for a couple or weeks and i was homeless for a month and a half before i found housing and that was after searching all summer for housing and applying through rental companies. this could totally not be your experience, you could definitely get approved right away because that has happened too. I\u2019m just letting you know what i have experienced and observed",

But you can't really do much until a month or so before school unless you plan on paying rent for a room or your own apartment over summer while you aren't there.  However, sometimes that is the only option. \n\nI lived in a few different apartments in Arcata and had good experiences from them all.  Only issue was with the mold but tbh you're going to get that anywhere.  \n\nI lived in McKinleyville and liked it much more but by then I had already grown out of the party phase and just hung out with my group of friends.",

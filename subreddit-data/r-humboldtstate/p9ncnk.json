    "postText": "Hello all! I'm a new student here and I made the mistake of not bringing my car haha! \nBut I have a few things to get from Walmart/Target and Safeway, but I don't know where to start when it comes to buses, it Al kind of seems confusing to me to be 100% honest \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude01\n\nIf any of you has had experience with the HSU bus systems, I would love to know how to get there, and what the Bus lifestyle is like! \nThank you for your time and help!",

You go to get directions somewhere and then click the icon that looks like a bus, similar to how you would get walking directions. I use this anytime I'm in a new area and still learning the busses. It got me from campus to Eureka very easily. You can even specify the time you want to arrive by. It will give very detailed turn-by-turn directions and live updated departure times for busses.",

None of them run on Sunday.\n\nService if [free for HSU students](https://parking.humboldt.edu/bus-riding). Slide your HSU ID card through the bus fare box.  If you are not enrolled in summer classes, you can pay a $45 fee during the summer.\n\nUse the [Transit app](https://transitapp.com/) to figure out bus schedules.\n\nThe pro tip is to befriend students who have cars. Here's [Zipcar information](https://parking.humboldt.edu/zipcar) per /u/elkwave's suggestion.",

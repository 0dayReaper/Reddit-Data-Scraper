    "postText": "Hi everyone... ESM major here, taking science classes online sucks.\nI\u2019m about ready to throw in the towel and take a NC (no credit) for a class this semester. Just finished calculating my grades and there\u2019s no way I can make it out of a D (even if I score an A on the final and turn in late work.)\nNot sure if it\u2019s worth the stress at this point and am thinking about focusing my energy on other classes. \nThe thing is, I\u2019m undecided on grad school. I saw the \u201cnot recommended\u201d note on the email sent out by HSU, but after speaking to my advisor I\u2019m a little more worried about having a letter grade bring down my GPA. \nOne thing that wasn\u2019t clear was wether or not you can replace a N/C with a letter grade if it\u2019s re-taken. I\u2019ll be checking in with my advisor again but was wondering if anyone gotten different advice. TIA!",

            "comment": "you can also ask for an incomplete but the prof has to agree and you have to finish the classwork some time before graduating.\n\ni know you can replace an f and maybe a d if retaken? not sure about a nc. \n\ni think the biggest thing with grad school is that you want to eventually take it for a letter grade. but i have to imagine schools will also be more flexible to people who graduated when we did. or maybe they wont. i tend to be overly optimistic.",

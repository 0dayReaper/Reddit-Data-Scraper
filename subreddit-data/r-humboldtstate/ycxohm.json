    "postText": "Hi, I'm thinking about transferring to Humboldt from out of state (UNR). I want to major in forestry, but am worried about the math and chemistry classes I may have to take. I struggle immensely with these subjects. I haven't passed any chemistry classes at UNR and I am currently enrolled in Precalculus II. \n\nFor those majoring in forestry, what should I expect in terms of math and chemistry?",

            "comment": "Forestry is heavily focused on statistics and trigonometry (For forest measurements and others) \n\nWith chemistry all have to take the basic intro class for it. Other than one soils class that focuses a little more on the chemistry that interact with the soil.",

Never failed any forestry class I took biometry, dendrology and many other hard classes including chem. Just try your best go to class and take notes after so you can actually listen during class. HSU is not a very hard school. Just stay focused",

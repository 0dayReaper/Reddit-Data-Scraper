You'll have to depend on your classmates for that.\n\nBut for e-mail, from the front page of HSU's website:\n\n* Quicklinks &gt; (Directories) Faculty &amp; Staff &gt; [Type their first or last name](https://its.humboldt.edu/directory)\n\nYou can show up and merely explain you are waitlisted and want to sit in on the class.",

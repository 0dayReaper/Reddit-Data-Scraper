    "postText": "Hello, I am a transfer student and will be applying to Humboldt next month to start school in the spring semester next year. I am just worried about applying and transferring in the spring and not being able to attend school traditionally, as it would make more financial sense to take a semester off than pay for distance learning. I'm just wondering if anyone has any ideas as to what I should do? Thank you in advance, I cannot wait to be up in Arcata!!",

I think the best thing to do is give yourself options and apply to Humboldt.  You can reassess as you get closer to Spring 2021.",

Talk to Admissions about it to check that if you do get accepted and you decide not to attend in the spring, what options you have available. \n\nWe don\u2019t know how long this pandemic will last. We are relying on a vaccine, but who knows when that will become available.",

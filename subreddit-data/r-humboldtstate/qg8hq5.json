We were originally going to live with a friend who was buying a house there but they haven\u2019t been able to close on one yet so no we are scrambling to find a place. Does anyone have any experience finding a place with a dog? Thanks for any help!",

They allowed pets in some of their rentals, but it looks like they have been replaced with Spinks Property Management which I can't speak to. Maybe someone else on here can. \n\nIt's notoriously difficult to find rentals in this area that allow pets, but it isn't completely unheard of. I keep thinking a cat cafe would do really well here because so many people aren't allowed to keep pets. Best of luck in your search!",

A few extra hundred cash on the deposit always sweetens the deal. Just play your cards right ya feel me",

Landlords cannot evict or restrict a renter because they have an emotional support animal.\" And in my own personal experience strombeck properties did allow me to bring my cat even in a non pet friendly building and the apartment complex I currently live in has a lot pets here despite saying pets aren't allowed. Hope that helps!",

This is the last of 3 Zoom meetings where you can easily ask the coordinator questions face-to-face, as it were.\n\nYes, you should be looking for off-campus housing now. And don't give anyone money without visiting their rental first in person. There are a lot of sophisticated scams online.",

If an Internet ad states they're a management company, then google the name, and look them up on Google Street View to see they have an office.\n\nSome of these scams are run by people who don't even live in the region. They can just talk convincingly about the area.",

I\u2019ve seen the couple of pictures on the website but aside from the closet/hanger space, it doesn\u2019t give me a very good idea of how much room there is (and even when using the measuring tools to find the volume of shelves\u2026 my brain doesn\u2019t know how convert that to articles of clothing!)  \nSo: defaulting all shirts to t-shirts and all pants to jeans/sweats, and accounting for other necessary clothing, roughly how many/much of each (+ other standard clothes) would you recommend bringing?",

To the side you can fit all of your your items that require to be hung or puffy items. Then I was able to fit small bins at the top where I kept snacks and other items. Also this tip is coming from someone who owns a lot of clothes and shoes! Plus if you run out of space you can always find bins and store items under your bed.",

The closet isn't super spacious, the dresser thing you get isn't great, but you can also keep things under your bed. If you keep some of the bins/boxes you use to move in, you can fit them underneath your bed pretty easily.",

            "comment": "I am excited, overwhelmed, curious, and disconnected. I miss being around students. I feel as if I am teaching into a void.\n\nI think I might be doing a good job. I am not sure if I overloaded my classes with too many readings, videos, or other activities. I am finding the gaps where information that I am used to sharing in a face-to-face class when I see that clarification is needed did not make it into my online course. Now, I am second-guessing myself on what else I could have forgotten.\n\nI was so hesitant about online discussion forums. Would they be an adequate substitute for in-class discussions? At the end of week two, I am blown away by the level of analysis and writing skills that students are showing. Now, I am terrified that the other weekly assignments I have are too much. I planned them as stopgaps to help for those who might not be comfortable posting their writing in a discussion forum for the whole class to read. Do I pivot and drop the assignments? Make them extra credit? What if this first three weeks is an excellent start that than goes downhill?\n\nHow much is too much? How much is too little? I want students to leave my classes, feeling that they learned something, and to be ready for the next set of courses. I had twenty-pages of notes from Spring 20 on what needed to be addressed in the course to transition to online, which took me the bulk of the summer to address. Here it is the end of week three, and I have six pages of tweaks, clarifications, cuts, and additions. I know I can do this. I need to re-frame my perspective and tackle this head-on. \n\nI hear from students about their circumstances and struggles. I try to be understanding and flexible \u2013 they are why I am here doing what I do. Though little reassurance comes, form the structure of the institution. There was a lovely message from the new provost in week one \u2013 radio silence since then. I assume the dean is in an undisclosed location without the ability to communicate. The department chair is an allusive being who shows up on a screen every two weeks, logoffs, only to send emails to remind us to be constant communication with our students. \n\nIs it rough? Yes. Will we make it through? Yes. How can I be so sure? I have seen students do incredible things against all the odds. I have seen faculty stumble and bumble through a semester only to go into the next on more robust and with more focus. I guess I am an optimist.",

We see you all trying, we just need a little less on our plates. I think most of really want to learn. And please, tell all your colleagues to slowwwwww down with the powerpoints. I get it, there\u2019s no sea of students in front of you. There\u2019s no easy way to read the room to see if people have gotten their notes down. Well, we aren\u2019t getting our notes down. I got so frustrated in one of my favorite classes that I tabbed out of zoom and did other work because I already knew I\u2019d have to go back and rewatch that lecture again pausing it every 30 seconds to try to get the information.",

Ironically my GE teacher is the only one I feel is actually handling this semester well, my major classes are all over the place and mostly feel like a waste of time and energy. If there was more standardization between approaches, even just within departments, it would be much more doable. The first two weeks were overloaded and stressful, week three is all over the place. It seems like some teachers are coping about as well as most of us, some are completely out of touch with the reality of life in 2020, and some straight up don't want to be here and probably shouldn't. It's completely understandable given the circumstances, but also frustrating considering that college isn't free. I am here because I want an education; only one teacher I have seems truly committed to that and even then it feels misguided. I don't necessarily blame professors though, it's a weird situation and a lot of the problems seem related to larger failings of HSU as a whole. \n\nReally, I just want to find some level ground here.\n\n/rant",

I learn by actually doing, not sitting in front of a screen. I hope it gets better for you. My classes are a mess too and every professor uses canvas differently and some have very poor tech skills which just wastes time for everyone. I know many are doing the best they can. I have one prof though, must be VERY well off and untouched by everything going on in the world because she seems to think none of this should be bothering anyone. Pop quizzed us right in the middle of a zoom lecture and then she starts lecturing everyone when they don\u2019t do well. Average score was a 60s. Not cool because she\u2019s grading us on barely anything. So many people don\u2019t even have a quiet place to work and there\u2019s a million distractions at home. Some people don\u2019t have great home environments either. But most of these professors aren\u2019t thinking about any of that",

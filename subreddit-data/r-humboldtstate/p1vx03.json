I am a transfer student coming to HSU this Fall. and I was curious if it were possible to get housing for one semester instead of the academic year? \n\nIf so how would I go about that?\n\nI only ask because I and my partner may be getting a place up there next semester.\n\nThank you all for your time and help!",

I've been hearing that there's a housing shortage up there (despite the vast amount of added housing since my time there) so there would likely be folks on waiting lists waiting to grab slots as they become available.",

You can leave but you will still be on the hook for your monthly payments. There are some exceptions but they are fairly extreme circumstances. I tried to get out of my housing assignment after one semester but I couldn\u2019t do it. The housing situation in Humboldt county is terrible, and I wish you all the luck in the world dealing with it.",

Only students that leave the university (withdraw, graduate, etc..) after the fall semester, and provide 30 days notice are able to be released from the spring semester without penalties. We do have a spring only application that opens on October 13th. Please email [housing@humboldt.edu](mailto:housing@humboldt.edu) if you have further questions.",

If you register your bike with a police department in City A, and your stolen bike is found in City B, whether you get your bike back has everything to do with whether the police department in City B takes the time to contact City A and track down who owns the bike, try to contact you, and handle the paperwork to return your bike (and the police department in City A has to take the time on its side to cooperate with City B).\n\nThis, unfortunately, often doesn't happen (in general; I have no information about UPD/Arcata specifically). \n\nI just don't want people thinking bike registration assures that a found bike gets returned. Basically, you need to register your bike every time you move. I would personally register it with both UPD and the Arcata Police Department to cover my bases.",

I didn't like the academic research program and I found other routes I could use degree. \n\nThe ABA program is a good pathway to a field that pays well and can be gratifying. It really depends on your career pathways. \n\nI loved the faculty and had a good time but the courses are definitely spotty.\n\nOverall the affordability was a draw for me and I believe I got a good education. I believe it's an average way to get into human services. There is a big need for therapists and social workers in the area.",

Do know anything about the masters in counseling here and if it could be useful on a pathway to a PhD, I really know very little about the entire process as none of my family or close friends have even been to college much less grad school. Thanks for your time.",

I never thought I'd work in social work and I found that its something I'd like to do for a while. \n\nBe careful with a PsyD. Look for broad careers. Example is that if you do an MFT or a Ph.D, you might restrict your potential. \n\nIf you want to work with people in a therapeutic environment, an MSW might be something to look into. \n\nGood luck on your goals. Hope this helps a little.",

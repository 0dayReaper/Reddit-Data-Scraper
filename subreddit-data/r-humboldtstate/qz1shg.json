It may not be paradise but it's hard for me to imagine a more inclusive place. Hope that helps!",

            "comment": "Right now HSU is actively working to improve conditions for trans students. There is a new gender diversity task force full of great people that are interested in addressing issues people of diverse genders face on campus. The school is also actively pursuing adding more gender neutral bathrooms on campus, and a gender neutral locker room. They've also started to take antitrans harassment (forced outing, malicious misgendering, etc) more seriously. Students can also have the correct name on their degree even if it's not legally changed. The correct name and pronouns can also be added to your student center (and canvas) and will print on the rosters in place of an incorrect legal name. There's also a trans support group through the counseling center for students who need it.\n\nAs for community I'd say the campus and Arcata community is generally trans friendly and often seeking ways to be more trans inclusive. Instances of transphobes were often a surprise to me or caught me off guard because everyone else is so chill about it. Of course, this might depend on how you look. I often find I'm trans in a way that makes people more comfortable because it fits into the cistem much easier. It might (heavy might because I wasn't part of sciences and am only speaking from stories by my peers) be more difficult though in the sciences instead of business or liberal arts because of the continued Bad Sciene of gender essentialism that's usually still taught. So you may experience that from peers/teachers ie \"it's nice you *identify* as xyz but REALLY... BIOLOGICALLY... ChRoMaSoMaLlY you're this other thing sweetie and you have to accept that\". But that's pretty common anywhere I think considering how \"new\" trans theory is (it's not new of course, just actually being seen in some places now). \n\nThe CRGS trans theory course is taught by a great prof who is an excellent advocate for trans students and overall just a nice thoughtful guy. \n\nAs for a negative, the queer community is so insulated up here because of how isolated the area is that you see a lot of infighting over goofy things (different perspectives and use of language) as opposed to putting energy toward collaboration, community building, and addressing more serious local intercommunity problems like racism, houselessness, addiction, and accessibility of healthcare. In my mind, constant language and ideology policing while queer students and community members are facing other immediate disparities is a waste of time and very privileged. Like let's all get on the same level of health and having our basic needs met before we worry about whether or not someone is internally transphobic and toxic/needs canceling just because they prefer using the word transsexual for themselves. Often this leads to people who are new to the queer community and/or aren't 100% educated on the discourse being left behind, ostracized, or feeling unwelcome. But I think that's a trend of elitism you can come to expect from a university space.

Housing has a special offering for LGBTQ+ people in the Rainbow Community, most places have gender neutral bathrooms as well as nobody will generally question why you use one door over the other.  Teachers will respect your pronouns and chosen name, and you can even set your HSU profile to do that.  This will also print your used name on the rosters, not your deadname, so even in the first day of class you won't have to answer to Rose if you go by Dave.\n\nI had some friends who were genderfluid and some who were trans and they all had a positive experience, but I can't fully speak for them.",

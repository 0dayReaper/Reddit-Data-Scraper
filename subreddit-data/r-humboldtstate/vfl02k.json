    "postText": "Does anyone know if positions in the student store open up during the summer? I\u2019ve been offered work study for my financial aid, but I was hoping to work in the student store because it\u2019s basically the same thing I\u2019ve been doing at my high school lol. So far, all I\u2019ve seen on handshake has been office positions (but I also saw an opening for a Grounds Student Assistant, so if anyone has any experience with that I\u2019d be interested in hearing it too:). Any input is appreciated!",

The company stands to make more money if the campus bookstore is located off-campus because students will still need to travel to the bookstore for certain services.\n\nPreviously, the bookstore and campus eateries were managed by nonprofits closely aligned with the university. But this is the trend in higher education -- corporatization.",

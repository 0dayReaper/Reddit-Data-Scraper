    "postText": "Hi! I was wondering if anyone can provide info about how reliable the bus/shuttle system is to and from school while living right next to a bus stop? I looked at the bus schedule and wasn't sure if certain areas have better, more reliable stops. I'm planning to live in North Town, or just south east of 7th st. (Redwoods side). Thank you in advance! : )",

            "comment": "It was super reliable when I used it, but that was many years ago. It picked up at 20 til the hour, and then my route left school every hour at 10 after. I think only once in a few months was it ever late, I had gotten worried I\u2019d missed it and started walking and then it drove by. Also I wouldn\u2019t consider SE of 7th street to be North Town by any means, that would be like Wildberries (14th street) and north imho. Your place would be a sort of gray area called \u2018near Healthsport\u2019 \ud83d\ude00.",

I used it a few times during covid if I was hanging out with friends and had a drink or two and didn\u2019t want to walk across town, it was pretty reliable for that as well.",

    "postText": "Hey All! I am just checking in to see if any of you have heard back, or know when we might hear back, from the Social Work department about admissions. I am taking an anatomy class, which has been absolutely terrible for my social science oriented brain, as it a requirement for my back up university (Humboldt is 100% my top choice as it is the coolest school ever). I am really really wanting to end my anatomy class experience by withdrawing from the course, but I refuse to do so, until I know for sure that I get to be a Lumber Jack. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso are there any Social Work majors on here? How has your experience been with the program?  I see that the staff is very impressive. Any favorite classes or especially outstanding professors I should know about? Thanks in advance! Hope to join you all here soon!!",

Overall her major complaint was that the program was too easy and she didn't feel very challenged by it. The other issue was that she felt like without continuing onto a masters, her degree was mostly useless unless she wanted to continue working the same entry level jobs she already had access to. The second gripe sounds like an issue with the institutional nature of social work rather than an actual issue with HSU.",

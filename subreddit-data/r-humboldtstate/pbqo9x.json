    "postText": "Hello HSU Students,\n\nOn September 14th it'll be the upcoming CA Governor recall election. Registered voters will decide on whether to recall Governor Gavin Newsom. \n\nWhat is your take on the recall election, do you support or oppose the recall, if you researched the replacement candidates which one would you like to lead CA if the Recall is successful, and will you be voting in the recall election?\n\nThis is supposed to be a public discourse of discussion and help bring awareness to HSU students/community on the upcoming recall election. \n\n\nPlease be civil in this discussion and do not be rude. \n(Every registered CA voter should've received a mail-in ballot for the recall election and if you don't turn that mail-ballot, then you have the option to vote in person on September 14th)",

So your upset he didnt close all wineries in all counties? I thought saving the economy was the Republican goal? That seems like what his office did, instead of a blanket closure they closed county by county depending on COV impact. Cant win with you guys. Lol.",

Also I am a big believer that a leader should never force people to make sacrifices that he is unwilling to make. And Gavin Newsom has done that by violating his own Covid lockdown rules.",

If it were anyone who wasn't a celebrity, they'd be in jail or prison or have faced real consequences for misdemeanor manslaughter, or evidence tampering. Newsom isn't squeaky clean, not even close, being related to Pelosi and all, and the hypocrisy....but this country doesn't need more out-of-touch celebrities/pop culture figures trying to make decisions for the rest of us. Haven't we learned from #45?",

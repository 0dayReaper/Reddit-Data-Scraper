                            "comment": "I can't speak to the difficulty of getting into a residence hall (pro tip: staff call them residence halls, not dorms).\n\nDo apply for on-campus housing on time. For freshmen, I recommend staying in The Canyon, Cypress or The Hill. They comprise the original halls built around the Jolly Giant Complex (JGC).\n\nThe JGC is a large building housing a recreation room and convenience market (first floor), mail room, meeting rooms, and housing administrative offices (second floor) and cafeteria (third floor).\n\nFor close access to the cafeteria alone, choose one of these residence halls. The other residence halls are spread around the campus, built much later, and are more focused on students cooking their own meals and sometimes doing their own restroom cleaning. (Pro tip: enjoy other people cooking your meals for you; ride that gravy train as long as possible. The cafeteria has a good selection of offerings.)\n\nIn terms of life hacks, the nice thing about coming in as a freshman in a freshman residence hall is that everyone is in the same boat. The bizarre ecosystem of high school life is gone. You're living in course quarters with a bunch of other people who all suddenly don't have any friends. Jump in and make friends immediately. The differences between you and other people in high school are largely diminished. Get to know everyone on your floor.",

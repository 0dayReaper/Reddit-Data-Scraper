When I had the lowest one there was a three week period at the end of the semester where I bought all kinds of random stuff just to spend the money. \"Yes I'll have a breakfast burrito, begal with cream cheese and expensive candy coffee!\" \n\nAfter that I learned students can donate those meal points to other students.",

It lasted me well for 2+ years since I'm frugal and got a job a few hours per week between classes that then gave me 30 hours/week in the summer. Only thing that drained my savings was traveling home. There was a family emergency and I had to buy more plane tickets than I had originally budgeted for. Bus tickets aren't much more useful and it's a miserable experience if your family lives further than the bay area. \n\nIf you can work more hours than I averaged, then you could do ok with less in the bank. Definitely use the free and reduced price options. No need to spend all your money on depot treats or at the fancy stores in town if you cant swing it.",

I brought a majority of my furniture, but ended up buying a couple more pieces as well as stocking the fridge and pantry. I managed to not work for about a month before it dwindled down to a place I was uncomfortable with. At around $500 I got a job at a local shop to supplement my first job (which I had the luxury of doing remotely). Now I\u2019m doing alright, but I\u2019m finally the broke college kid I\u2019ve never really been.\n\nI find I eat a lot less now, maybe because I\u2019m a broke college kid, but I think it\u2019s mostly the lack of fast-food. I basically pulled a reverse \u2018freshman 15\u2019 which isn\u2019t a bad thing for me.\n\nAlso the greatest hurdle I experienced was banking with BofA and finding out every ATM here is closed. This becomes a massive pain when employers pay you in cash.\n\nIt\u2019s really beautiful up here! I hope you get as much joy as you can out of it!",

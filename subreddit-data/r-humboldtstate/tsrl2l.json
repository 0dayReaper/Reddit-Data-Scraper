            "comment": "Not a poly sci major but a very good friend of mine was. His opinion was that the program sucked but that at least he got his degree. He\u2019s getting his teaching credential in history now and he was just focused on getting any degree before he got his teaching credential, which is what he said really mattered. \n\nYou can look up the class schedule online to see what poly sci and legal classes there are that would interest you/ be beneficial for you when you go to law school. Tbh the course selection for a lot of social sciences at this school are lacking. For the major i studied, I enjoyed my classes and teachers, but was disappointed that there were very few \u201cinteresting classes\u201d in my major outside of the 4-5 required classes. I checked csus and ucs for their coursework in my major and EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL had twice as many classes minimum. I remember ucsd and ucsb had about 5-6x the amount of classes. Still, I enjoyed hsu.",

Especially over the phone. \n\n\nBut they should have pointed you to the campus ready website at the very least since the latest news bulletin pretty clearly outlines what you are supposed to do if exposed/if you test positive. Its not reassuring that the health center didn't know what to tell you, but ill give them leeway in case it was a student employee who answered your call and didn't know how to direct you to the correct places. This is also pretty likely for housing since its usually students answering the phones there. \n\nPM me if you've got questions you still don't have answers to. I'm pretty good at digging up answers or finding the right people to ask on campus",

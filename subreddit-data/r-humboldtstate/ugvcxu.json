    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI'm just looking for a little guidance. I graduated from HSU last semester with a BS in Biology (Marine bio concentration). I think my long term goal is to work for Fish and Wildlife, but I'm not quite ready to take a big step and want something smaller and still related to that outdoorsy field. I didn't get the beeest grades (stupid online classes), and don't have any volunteer work under my belt. Covid took over right when I was supposed to be starting some fun projects. Now, I'm just not sure where to start. My resume is basically empty, so I feel that anything I apply to, I won't even be considered. What are some places that are like BLM, or even Green Diamond, that typically take on a lot of non-experienced people?\n\nThanks in advance!",

All of these have a wide variety of job listings available and are updated constantly. If your resume looks bare make sure to highlight the courses you took and highlight any projects you participated in. Good Luck!",

Immediately after graduation you aren't expected to have experience. The longer you take to get a job, the worse off you will be.\n\nTake any job related to your field and stick with it for 2 years and then begin looking for a better job.",

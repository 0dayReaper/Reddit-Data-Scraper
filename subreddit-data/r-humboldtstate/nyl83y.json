    "postText": "Hi my name is Luis and I'm looking to room with someone this upcoming fall semester. I'm a 22 year old transfer student from Sacramento and it will be my first semester at Humboldt State; I'm also fully vaccinated. Since I don't know the area in Arcata well I thought it would be a good idea to get a room on campus but since I wasn't given the option to redirect to HSU earlier I missed the priority deadline for housing and I'm now #142 on the waitlist. Feel free to email me @ [llealguerra@gmail.com](mailto:llealguerra@gmail.com) for more information about myself and if its possible for us to be roommates.",

    "postText": "Hey all! Saw circus club on campus today for the fair, can't commit to a club, but was curious if there was any other people at HSU or in Arcata who  practice any flow arts? I hoop and am learning poi basics, and I'm pretty amateur but I'm easily entertained and like trying all kinds of moves, but am looking for any flow-mies that may be in the area!\nThe Arcata plaza is a little too public place for practice, imo, but maybe somewhere on campus or nearby.",

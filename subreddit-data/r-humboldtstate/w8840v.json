Unlike many universities, new students are not required to live in the campus residence halls their first year. The Comfort Inn option, in my view, is to make things easier for students who are coming from very far away because finding a good apartment can be difficult if you are not already here. \n\nThat said, the university is trying to build additional housing as fast as it can. The university tussled with the city for a long time over a plot of land that was going to have student housing facilitated by a private company. The university finally just bought the land itself and is moving forward -- which is can do with less oversight from the city than the private company that was going to build. It was a lesson for Arcata on the principle of [\"~~Fuck around~~ Micromanage and find out.\"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fuck-around-and-find-out).\n\nThe university used more eloquent language. \"[Looking ahead, we\u2019ll need to be creative and pursue a variety of other options.](https://www.madriverunion.com/articles/no-means-no-on-the-village-or-maybe-it-means-nuclear/)\"  The following article [has a graphic](https://www.madriverunion.com/articles/hsu-to-build-800-units-of-housing-at-craftmans-mall/) listing 5 student housing projects underway. The one previously mentioned is the Craftsman Mall site (it wasn't a mall in the traditional sense) which is slated for completion in 2024. Building anything through the state takes time, but less time than going through city government that wants to make new student housing as small as possible. *cough*",

Maybe it's the school trying to increase housing for students.  \n\nI've heard fires pushed other communities into the area,  and people working from home due to covid came in from the bay area, reducing available housing. \n\nAccording to some people working on campus who used to be students... the campus has been at reduced capacity during covid. \n\nI don't exactly know.  I've only been going to HSU since Fall 2021. I'd like to hear what others that have been going to HSU  pre covid think.",

There has been a dorm waitlist every year I\u2019ve been here, and that was before covid and the cal poly announcement. \nThey knew housing would be even worse for the entire community when they decided to make the school a cal poly, and they still decided to do that before actually building the new dorms. \nIt\u2019s nice that they\u2019re letting people stay at comfort inn (it\u2019s really the only choice they have besides having a lot of students not come since there\u2019s very little housing open) but it\u2019s all the way across town away from campus/arcata in an area that\u2019s not very walkable or pleasant. Living in the inn is going to be nowhere near the experience of living on campus in the dorms, where people have walking access to the forest and town.",

            "comment": "From their website:\n\n&gt; A partnership with Cal Poly Humboldt and the Comfort Inn to expand affordable housing for students during the interim of our on-campus housing growing. Students will be housed double occupancy, in each room, in either two queen beds or two twin beds. Free amenities include weekly housekeeping services, daily breakfast, Wi-Fi, limited parking, and more!  \n\n&gt; The Comfort Inn offers 98 beds to call home. \n&gt; * Two story complex, with a main entrance and elevator.  \n&gt; * Rooms are furnished with either two queen beds or two twin beds, two desks two dressers and closet space.  \n&gt; * All beds come with sheets and blankets included.  \n&gt; * Housekeeping including washing and changing sheets is included twice a week and up to 3 times a week if a resident would like.  \n&gt; * Each room has a mini fridge and microwave.  \n&gt; * Continental breakfast is provided free daily from 6:30am - 9:30am.  \n&gt; * Meal plans to eat on campus are optional.  \n&gt; * Each room has a TV with cable provided.  \n&gt; * Laundry facilities are available to pay to wash and dry clothes.  \n&gt; * Indoor pool and fitness center access are also included.  \n&gt; * Parking is free, but limited.\n\n&gt; **FAQs**\n\n&gt; **How do I sign up for Comfort Inn?** Students must have a completed 2022-2023 Housing Application found in the myHousing portal. Right now students can complete a google form to let us know their interest. Please email housing@humboldt.edu for more information.  \n\n&gt; **If I decide to live in the Comfort Inn, will I remain on the waitlist?** No. Students that elect to live at the Comfort Inn will be taken off the waitlist when they are placed in a room.  \n\n&gt; **Is the Comfort Inn the same price as living in the buildings on-campus?** No, it is a lower rate to live at the Comfort Inn. $21.42 per day per person ($2,656/semester), saving you $1,326 per year on traditional housing rates for a double at $26.77 per day per person ($3,319/semester).\n\n&gt; **When can I move into the Comfort Inn?** The Housing Agreement starts on Monday, August 15, 2022, but if students need to, they can move in as early as Saturday August 13, 2022 for an additional $22 per night. Move-In appointment times will be sent to residents.  \n\n&gt; **What if I no longer want to live at the Comfort Inn for the 2022-2023 Academic Year?** Room change requests can be submitted through the myHousing portal under Forms. Students are obligated to the full 2022-2023 Academic Year Agreement.  \n\n&gt; **Will there be maid service?** Yes. Maid service will be twice a week, or up to 3 times a week if residents would like. Sheets will be washed and changed, and the bedroom and bathroom will be cleaned.\n&gt; **Can I pick my roommate?** Roommates will be assigned based on the profile questions in the Housing Application. However, if you have someone specific you are trying to room with that also wants to live at the Comfort Inn, you and the roommate you would like to live with should email housing@humboldt.edu and we will see if we can accomodate your request.  \n\n&gt; **What if I don't have a car?** Not a problem! The Arcata &amp; Mad River Transit System (AMRTS) that students get free access to during the academic year (included with their term fees) has a bus stop just down the street. Students just need to show their Humboldt ID, and can ride for free. AMRTS offers bus service to campus Monday - Saturday, 7 am - 10 pm. Monday - Friday, buses depart from McDonald\u2019s (within walking distance) every 31 minutes on the hour; and every 47 minutes on the hour at the campus Library. On Saturday, buses depart every 38 minutes on the hour from McDonald\u2019s and every 52 minutes on the hour from campus. Check the AMRTS site for the full schedule.  \n\n&gt; **What if I'm bringing a car?** Residents will have free parking at the Comfort Inn, but space is limited. Students will also have to purchase a parking permit when parking on-campus.  \n\n&gt; **Where will I get mail and packages sent to me?** You can have your mail and packages sent to: Your Name, Comfort Inn Room # XXX, 4700 Valley West Blvd. Arcata, CA 95521.  \n\n&gt; **Will staff be living at the Comfort Inn?** Yes, there will be two Resident Advisors living in the building. A Residence Life Coordinator will also be overseeing this area.  \n\n&gt; **What sort of activities will Reslife be offering to residents?** The breakfast room space will be available daily for Residence Life programming, such as game nights and study groups, after 9:30 am. Activities will be planned here, just like the buildings on-campus.  \n\n&gt; **Is it safe there?** The Comfort Inn has a camera surveillance system. University Police and hotel staff will patrol the property regularly. The hotel desk is staffed 24/7, including holidays. Two Cal Poly Humboldt Resident Assistants (student staff) will live in the Comfort Inn residential community. They will help reinforce the Campus Code of Student Conduct, and foster a safe and welcoming environment that supports your success.   \n\n&gt; **What if I have an emotional support animal** Unfortunately the Comfort Inn will not be an option for you. The only animals allowed are small fish or reptiles in 10-gallon aquariums.\n\n&gt; **How will I access food?** There will be a free continental breakfast each morning from 6:30am-9:30am. How residents eat lunch and dinner will vary for each resident. Meal plans to eat on-campus are available for purchase but are optional. Residents will want to decide how often they plan to be on-campus, and how often they plan to eat there. When you use a swipe at the J, you could also get an ozzi box (to-go box) and take food back with you since it's all you can eat. So two meals in one. Residents will have until September 1st to lower their meal plan for the fall semester. So if a resident finds that they aren't using their meal plan enough they could downgrade or cancel their plan by the September 1st deadline. Residents can always upgrade a meal plan later on, should they decide to start eating on-campus more often. All rooms will come with a mini-fridge and microwave as well.\n\nThe J is frowns down on eating in the dining hall and then taking food to go, so not sure how that\u2019s going to work out.",

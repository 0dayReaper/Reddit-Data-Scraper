    "postText": "Hello, \n\nPotential incoming grad student for Cal Poly Humboldt here. I know the housing situation is a mess up there at the moment, but I was wondering if there was a specific place grad students were living and if there were any resources for incoming graduate students. \nI know the student body of grad students is small, so if anyone has any more information and/or resources for newcomers that'd be great.\n\nAlso how was the grad school experience up in Humboldt? Would love to hear some stories and personal experiences!\n\nThanks and good luck with the housing search y'all!",

            "comment": "I would talk to your department head for your program and ask if anyone is looking for a housemate. Usually in the biology department they will send emails asking everyone if they have a room available to rent. Sometimes your PI will know if a graduate student is looking for someone.",

Your advisor can be your best resource for most things! Definitely ask dept head to circulate an email to your cohort, something is bound to bounce back. Craigslist is still used by some landlords here but always be smart ~ hope you enjoy this special place.",

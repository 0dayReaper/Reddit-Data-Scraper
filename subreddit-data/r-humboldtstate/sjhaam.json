    "postText": "Can you pay to continue living on campus in the summer? I'm aware that some **in-person** summer courses could exist this year and I'd like to take one. Does anyone know if they were offering in-person summer courses in 2021 or before COVID? If so, were there options for meal plans, were some of the facilities open during the summer?\n\nDon't really have a place I call \"home\" at the time being so I'm probably gonna stay in the area for most of my summer.",

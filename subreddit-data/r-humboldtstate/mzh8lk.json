    "postText": "Hey everyone! So I've been unemployed ever since the pandemic started (which was the main reason why I went back to school so financial aid could cover my bills) and with transfering into Humboldt in the Fall, a job is my first priority. I plan to (hopefully) live on campus so I'm wondering how likely it is to be able to get a job on-campus? Ideally I'd like to get a job on-campus because I'm from the Los Angeles area so getting an off-campus job may be a bit of a problem when I'll have to leave Arcata during the breaks. Still, I have to keep that possibility open, so how is the job market for entry-level jobs in Arcata? I preferably don't want to go back to working in food service anymore but I do have six years of experience in it and still have a valid ServSafe certification for restaurant management so I'm not opposed to it if that's all that's available.\n\nI should mention that I don't drive. I'm waiting on being fully vaccinated to take my written test (I won't be fully vaccinated until the end of May) and then hopefully be able to learn quickly enough at a driving school to get my license before I head up to HSU in August but if I can't pass the behind the wheel test before then, I will not have a car or a license to rent a car if that makes any difference on how simple it is to get a job in Arcata.",

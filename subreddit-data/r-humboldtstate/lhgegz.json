    "postText": "Hi all! My dream is to work with wild animals in a sanctuary doing husbandry work and taking care of them (i don't want to be a vet, so not doing vet stuff). I see that HSU has two animal based degrees, but im not sure which to go for. Wildlife or zoology? Which did you major in and what are you doing with it? Even if I'm working at a zoo I'd still be happy (although zoos are inhumane... hopefully that will change or I'd at least be a caring worker).\n\nMy main goal is to work directly with wild animals to keep them company as well as feeding, and other stuff (basically like when you see people on the internet working with big cats or other animals, I'm not quite sure what else they do... but I would love to do it.)\n\nAs you can see I'm not totally sure what job I'd exactly be doing. I just know I want to work directly with animals. So if you could point me in the right direction, it would be much appreciated!!! Thanks!!",

            "comment": "Wildlife and Zoology is becoming more and more computer based as managing natural resources and studying the evolution of whole taxa requires heavy involvement in statistics (if you want to go that route). The jobs that require animal handling try to keep it to a minimum bc handling animals causes them a lot of stress and depending on the species they can even die in your hands from being overwhelmed (small birds, small mammals, lizards, etc. ). \n\nI've been working as a wildlife technician for the past 4 years and the overlap with sanctuary/rehabbers tends to be that most techs did a little rehab work when they were in high school or undergrad and then move away from it because it's primarily voluntarily. It does sound like you're looking for animal husbandry and if you really wanted to stay long term at a non-profit rehab it would probably be in the form of a volunteer coordinator, vet, or someone in an administrative position (HR, accountant, etc.) I've noticed in most animal focused careers the bottom of the ladder volunteer and seasonal stuff gets you the most hands on access to animals and as you move on to permanent and higher paying positions you spend more time in an office. \n\nI think you'll do great in whichever major has coursework that is going to keep you engaged and interested and as long as you volunteer and network and build a reputation as a team worker who has leadership skills you can definitely advance in the realm of rehabbing/zookeeping. Btw I wouldn't knock zoos. Many times the \"Sanctuaries\" you see on IG are basically just holding animals captive for money and no oversight or Zoo Accreditation, essentially the modern day roadside zoo. Compare that with the San Diego Zoo that brought the CA Condor back from the brink of extinction and is currently funding the Hawaii Bird Recovery Program, they're making huge differences in the world.\n\n LA definitely has rehab facilities, so many opossums, owls, squirrels, etc get hit by cars, mauled by cats and so on, and those lil critters need help! Good luck out there! Hopefully you'll only have to deal with one semester of online courses T\\_T",

I plan on looking into volunteering at Madrona marsh or the natural history museum after covid, since la zoo requires 100 hours outside of their own facility to become a volunteer.",

            "comment": "When I started at a community college a few years back, my goal was sanctuary work as well, but as I've done some volunteering and taken more classes my interests have shifted more to field work and zoo work. I just recently transfered into the Wildlife program and since it's been online I really can't give it a fair review but I did want to reply to your comment about zoos being inhumane, because I used to feel the same way.\n\nThere are a wide variety of organizations that call themselves zoos, and some are better than others. The good zoos are really great though - they put the welfare and health of their animals first, provide enriching environments that enable them to behave naturally, contribute to conservation work, and also do rehab and release. I volunteer at one in the Bay Area and have to say that I've never seen anything that I would call inhumane.\n\nI am not familiar with the AZA accredited zoos in your area, but it might be worth looking into their volunteer/internship programs to get experience with husbandry/animal care and also to get a feel for the type of work they do. You probably also have sanctuaries that take volunteers/interns. Talk to their staff and find out what they studied and what their career paths were like. That may or may not help you decide on a major, but the hands on experience is an important part of getting jobs with animals, even more so than the specific degree you have. Good luck!\n\nEditing to add: One of the reasons my interests have shifted was learning that many of the sanctuaries and rescues I'm interested in have very few paid staff, and rely mostly on volunteers. Zoos and field jobs don't pay amazingly but at least there are more paying job opportunities in those areas.",

I think LA zoo is aza accredited but there's also alot of small wildlife refuges near me. I'm in San pedro right by the marine mammal care center, where I used to volunteer as an education docent. I loved it and they do great work with the seals and sea lions. However I'd prefer to work with more land based animals than aquatic.",

You\u2019d have to look for internships or volunteer opportunities while enrolled that would open the door for that type of work. I\u2019m not sure that the zoology or wildlife degree would be worth it for you. We have amazing programs here but they\u2019re primarily focused on research and policy to help with conservation of animals still in the wild. \n\nThe wildlife options are heavily focused on research and writing research papers. I can\u2019t stress that enough. If I had to pick any of the options for what you\u2019re talking about doing I\u2019d probably go with zoology. If I\u2019m keeping it real,  UC Davis\u2019s Animal Science program is more tailored to what you want to do.",

I also don't have uc money nor money to move in that area. Humboldt is cheaper haha. Thanks for the advice. There is the Marine mammal care center near me where I can get husbandry volunteer work done. I plan on doing that after covid and once I get healthy physically. (I have a heart and lung condition)",

There\u2019s some wonderful rescues and care centers up here. Hopefully you can get into one those places as a volunteer once here as well! Good luck with everything and I hope your health gets better too. I chose the wildlife conservation option and I do like it, although I was expecting more. Some of that disappointment has been created from being entirely online though. The hardcore department focus on research and crafting the perfect research paper is useless to me because I\u2019m not interested in doing that for my career",

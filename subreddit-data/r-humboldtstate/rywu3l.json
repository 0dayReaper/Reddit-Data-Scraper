    "postText": "So I know this is a massively unpopular opinion among young adults, but my brother and father work in healthcare so we've been watching the numbers closely. The current surge is like nothing we've seen previously, and it's going to put a major strain on the already extremely limited hospital system in Humboldt County. [As of January 6](https://www.northcoastjournal.com/NewsBlog/archives/2022/01/06/public-health-confirms-107-new-covid-19-cases-two-new-hospitalizations), the 7-day average showed about 1 in 3 covid tests in Humboldt County came back positive. Single-day increases in cases are setting all-time records for the county and show no signs of slowing down. Check out [this graph](https://www.google.com/search?q=california+humboldt+county+covid+case+graph&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS868US868&amp;ei=fV_ZYYPOBtuxqtsP96aa6Ao&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDgKvK8aH1AhXbmGoFHXeTBq0Q4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=california+humboldt+county+covid+case+graph&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BwgAEEcQsAM6CggAEEcQsAMQyQM6BQgAEIAEOgUIABCGAzoECAAQQzoICAAQgAQQyQM6BggAEBYQHjoGCAAQCBAeOgQIIRAKSgQIQRgASgQIRhgAUKYFWJY_YNJCaAFwAngAgAG9AYgB6hOSAQQxOC44mAEAoAEByAEIwAEB&amp;sclient=gws-wiz) for new daily cases in Humboldt county if you aren't convinced. While some may argue the Omicron variant fueling this surge causes less severe illness, it is also an order of magnitude more transmissible. It's a numbers game, and if each case is 40% less likely to hospitalize, but there are 4x the cases due to the higher transmissibility, that still results in more people ending up in the hospital. Now, while most students will not develop illnesses severe enough to result in hospitalization due to the booster requirement and younger average age, it doesn't mean we won't catch and spread the virus to those at risk in the community. Omicron has shown to be very effective at causing breakthrough infections that allow vaccinated people to spread to others.\n\nSo with all this, why has the university officially decided to go ahead with in-person classes meeting on the first day of instruction? In the fall, despite having lower single-day increases, lower positivity rates, and a much less transmissible variant, we still did the first 2 weeks online. A growing list of universities in California have decided to start the spring semester online, such as Stanford, SF State, UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UC Irvine. It seems logical to me that the same should be done here now, at least for the first week to reduce transmission and isolate cases. Without the option to join classes online, some students will inevitably miss the first week of classes due to contracting covid during this surge and having to stay home.\n\nI know nobody can speak on behalf of the university, but maybe some people can help me understand the logic behind this inconsistent behavior from the start of the fall semester vs now. Have factors really improved enough to justify this change?  \n\n\nEdit: Added [UC Berkeley](https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/instruction/) to the list of prominent CA campuses that have moved to online instruction for the first weeks of the spring semester.",

We have not had any outbreaks on campus due to the high standards we employ on campus and will continue to maintain. If it occurs, parameters and protocols will be shared at that time. If students test positive for COVID, they are instructed to work with their professors on assignments accordingly.\u201d\n\nImagine the glee of professors, also possibly sick with Covid getting emails from multiple individuals on top of everything else trying to figure out what the fuck to do about assignments, missing class instruction etc every single time one of us catches a case\u2026\n\nEdit: here\u2019s the DOS info if anyone else wants to also contact\n\nEboni Ford Turnbow, Ph.D.\nDean of Students\nHumboldt State University\n707-826-5694\neturnbow@humboldt.edu",

County public health cannot offer contact tracing any longer. They do not have the staff. They also don\u2019t notify anyone anymore, again, rural area, very few staff. So none of that is valid. I dunno, I\u2019m just a student but it sure seems to me it\u2019s better to ride the surge out and then go back to f2f in early February lowering the chance of a larger outbreak on campus. The wait until it spreads like wildfire approach is not my favorite idea. We live in such a rural area and the resources for the local community are stretched incredibly thin. This will just add to the problem. What they\u2019re gonna do is just cause us to move to virtual for the entire semester at that point. I think most of us would like to avoid that.

This requires your claim of being immunocompromised to be backed up with a medical diagnosis. I have no idea if this idea would fly. As I said, it's a shot in the dark.\n\n2. Request, as a fusion of the SDRC's alternative media and note taking services... for an assistant to sit in the classroom on your behalf and do a two-way stream of the class sessions. If the SDRC signs off on your medical disability, then maybe the instructor has to make reasonable accommodations.",

The problem is that they\u2019re not airtight (literally) and the stakes for me are much, much higher. I know it\u2019s difficult to understand, but saying there\u2019s steps I can take to protect myself is like saying to a bunch of skydivers - but I\u2019m the only one without a backup chute. If something goes wrong, I\u2019m toast, and the only way I can make sure that doesn\u2019t happen is to not jump. \n\n2. I am being forced. I\u2019m a student, same as every other student. I\u2019ve put in my years, I\u2019ve paid my tuition, I\u2019ve worked hard, and I\u2019m one semester away from my degree. I\u2019m a first gen student and I\u2019ve clawed and scraped my way through this, I\u2019ve worked full time while going to school and this is my only way forward. How would you feel if every time you entered a classroom, you had to play Russian Roulette to get through the door? And if you objected, people said \u201cwell nobody\u2019s forcing you\u201d. You can turn around, give up on your education. Never get a degree, never be a scientist, go work whatever job a high school diploma can get you for the rest of your life. After all, nobody\u2019s forcing you. \n\n3. Who exactly do you propose I speak with? I\u2019ve already begged the woman in charge of student Covid response for help - she blew me off. I\u2019ve begged the teacher for help - he blew me off. I\u2019m making my way down a list of people who are more than happy to let it be someone else\u2019s problem. There aren\u2019t any magical fixes for people with disabilities, we have to fight tooth and nail. I\u2019ve got a couple more people on my list, but I\u2019m entirely at the mercy of someone who will hopefully just decide to be nice that day and help me out. I GUARANTEE that there are a hundred other students just like me facing the same problem. It\u2019s easy to assume that we\u2019ll just be taken care of, that someone will figure it out for us, but that\u2019s almost never the case. We fight for every inch, and if we lose then nobody cares.\n\n**Tl;dr: Those protections aren\u2019t perfect and I\u2019m at way higher risk. Only being able to get an education if I\u2019m willing to risk my life IS being forced. And who exactly do you think this mysterious helping force is? That\u2019s the problem, nobody cares. And people like me are entirely at the mercy of people who get to choose whether or not to care.**",

If the campus Covid coordinator, the professor, and the SDRC all say they don\u2019t care, there\u2019s nothing more I can do. You think my doctors are going to come down to campus and talk to someone for me like they\u2019re my mom discussing a gluten-free diet with my kindergarten teacher?

But I moved to Humboldt to be here. So now I have to apply to different universities (which costs money), postpone graduation for a YEAR (which puts off grad school for another year and a half), and I\u2019d have to move away because I wouldn\u2019t have any financial aid to live on. \n\nDo you see how ridiculous that is? All because of one single school to which I have already applied, been accepted, moved to Humboldt for, and have attended for two years doesn\u2019t want to help me. To you, it\u2019s a theoretical hurdle. To me, it\u2019s as arbitrary as if they refused you because of the color of your hair. If HSU refuses you right now, if they didn\u2019t even have the decency to call and you just showed up to class and the teacher pretended like you didn\u2019t exist, how far would that derail you? How much of your life would that cost you, if people let it be someone else\u2019s problem?",

Everyone entering the HSU Library will need to show their current HSU ID card.  \n\n&gt; We acknowledge this is an inconvenience. However, this decision is based on a number of factors including high case rates, our intent to reduce risk, and to help protect in-person instruction this spring semester. We are looking forward to increasing access to community members. We will be fully opened as conditions change. Thank you for your continued support and patience.  \n\n&gt; Cyril Oberlander, Library Dean",

But that somehow isn't translating to any reasonable prevention measures with instruction and events. I wonder if we'll get to a point where so many students and faculty are out sick that they'll be forced to temporarily go remote just to keep attendance numbers up.  \n\n\nI would appreciate it if we had at the very least a Hyflex online option for face-to-face classes. Because right now, if you get sick, you're fucked. You have to miss class for a week or more. I have 15 units worth of lab classes, and missing a lab usually has a tangible impact on your grade.",

Classes start on Tuesday, January 18... The high percentage of vaccination coupled with the booster requirement and universal masking in all of our spaces has provided us with the opportunity to proceed as planned.\"\n\nAdditionally, the provost instructed faculty to move ahead with starting in person instruction on the first day of classes.

    "postText": "so I'm on the fence about going back to school. I'm thinking about zoology but I am really bad with science and math but I love animals. The one school I've looked at and most interested in is Humboldt University in California. But I'm afraid to go across country for school and especially in an expensive state. \nAlso I do not want to live on campus AT ALL. I would try to live on my own or with a roommate but I was wondering if anyone was or currently is a student who can tell me what the zoology program is like and living there is like.",

            "comment": "Please look into the housing situation here before deciding. It\u2019s very difficult to find a place off campus, and on campus housing is extremely limited, which forces a lot of students who would otherwise be living on campus to compete for off campus housing. Homelessness is a real problem for students here. \n\nThat said, I am not in the Zoology program, I chose wildlife instead. Both majors are science majors and require math, but looking at the website, zoology requires much more (chemistry, physics, calculus). The wildlife conservation and management major requires some of those core maths and sciences but provides a little more flexibility (you can take soils or GIS instead of physics, for example).\n\nLook at the course requirements for the majors you\u2019re interested in at different schools, the career prospects, and the housing/living situation in each location and hopefully that comparison will help you decide. Good luck!",

You probably want to take intro to zoology at a community college before taking the plunge to spend all that money to go to Humboldt.  See if you even like it first.\n\nEdit:  I majored in biology, concentration in Cellular/Molecular biology.  My entire life was about studying, with the occasional social event.",

Ease your way into science and math somewhere where housing isn't a nightmare and units are considerably less expensive. If you're able to keep up with material, I'd say it's worth the move to pursue it.\n\nCurrent experience, the housing situation is an actual disaster here, and all of the administrative sides of things seem extremely poorly handled ( housing prioritization, costs of everything, required classes being scheduled for the same time slots, etc) but the students and faculty all seem amazing. There's room for improvement, no question, but it's a beautiful area and the vast majority of professors seem willing to go the extra mile to help with any issues.",

            "comment": "And to actually change your major or concentration, all you need to do is fill out a form on the Office of the Registrar's website on\nhumboldt.edu. Its a weird form where once you fill it out, a copy of it is sent to everyone who needs to digitally sign it. I recently changed my concentration and the entire process took only a day.\n\nIf you need help filling out this form I would set up a session with an academic advisor of the school. \n\nHere's the link to where I'm talking about: [Link](https://registrar.humboldt.edu/changing-your-major)\n\nSource: Personal Experience\n\nEdit: Link to site described added",

            "comment": "If you do have a concentration for your major, there's a couple of ways to confirm your concentration online I believe.\n\nOne of these ways is by running declared programs in your DARS. Your declared program(s) are the major, minor etc. programs you are registered for with HSU. So if you do this and then look at your most recently generated DARS report and see your major with a concentration listed, you then know that you are registered for that major's concentration. \n\n\nI believe in your Student Center there may be another way to verify your concentration but I don't remember the path to reach it. Trying the previously reccomended way first is what I would reccomend. Good luck.\n\nSource: Personal Experience",

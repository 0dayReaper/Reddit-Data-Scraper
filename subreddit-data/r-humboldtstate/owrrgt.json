            "comment": "&gt;which ones easier or harder \n\nI'm interpreting your comment as asking about driving routes. If you're starting from I-5, the two main routes are Highway 20 at Williams and State Route 299 at Redding. \n\n299 has many curves through the mountains and isn't recommended for someone who gets car sick or hates heights. It's also a snow and ice concern in winter.\n\n20 is my preferred route even though it's maybe 15 to 20 minutes slower than 299. Although, if leaving from Arcata, 299 has even more reduced time getting to I-5 because 299 connects at Arcata.\n\n The town of Willits is a good place to stop on 20 for fast food and restrooms. You won't see the town from the highway, so pay attention to the signs. There are a fair number of curves around Clear Lake on 20. A straighter, slower straight route around the lake is to take State Route 29 around the lake.\n\nIf you're considering 101 or I-5 from the Bay Area, 101 is an uneventful and surely much faster drive.",

Type in \"299\" and hit the \"Search\" button. You'll see all road delays across all of 299. \n\nCheck it before you travel. At the moment, 299 appears to be closed in Trinity County with no advised workaround. So, I wouldn't drive 299 until that situation is remedied.\n\nYou can track fire incidents at the [CalFire website](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/).",

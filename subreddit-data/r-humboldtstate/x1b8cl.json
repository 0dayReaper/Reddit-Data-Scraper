They're not going to reject you.\n\nYou could message them to say there is a computer class during their meeting time. They might discuss a new meeting time.",

If you do decide to come just for a bit that's totally fine and we're going to try to host lots of events, some outside of the regular meeting time. There's also a club discord you can join if you'd like to get connected to other cs students here and it's a good place to find out when and where our future meetings and events will be. If you search for the Humboldt state student hub on discord you should be able to find us there.",

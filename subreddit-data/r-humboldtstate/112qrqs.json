I also Love weed. Does anyone know if thats true? Teachers have been warning me about it too, which makes me laugh. Is the weed any better than in LA?",

There may be 'craft cannabis' but having been grown in this county doesn't make it any more special than craft cannabis grown elsewhere.\n\nYes, Humboldt is known for cannabis growing, a legacy held over from when cannabis was illegal. Now that it is legal to grow, that reputation may change because there are much flatter and sunnier places to grow a vastly larger amount of cannabis than Humboldt County and much larger markets for well-connected companies to grow into. Being located in Humboldt County is usually a liability because it is so remote and everything has to be transported out beyond the redwood curtain.",

No refutation took place. \n\nIf you google the term 'terroir' you will see it comes from the wine industry. If you google the meaningfulness of terroir you will find numerous examples of such topics as champagne only legally being allowed to be called champagne if it comes from the region of Champagne in France. \n\nThere are many examples, and what all of these have in common is national laws and international agreements and international sanctions when a company outside the protected region calls its product by the protected name. It is an issue purely of marketing to maintain market dominance, if not a monopoly. At best, it's romanticism.\n\nHumboldt was a popular name when cannabis was illegal. Humboldt County cannot claim rights to the terms 'weed' or 'cannabis' or 'marijuana'. At best, it can try to market the brand of 'made in Humboldt' like the local milk industry tried to do. \n\nWith craft cultivators blooming around the country and the world, I see no reason Humboldt will maintain this brand, which only recently began being conceived as a brand. I have no faith in local marketing efforts to promote that brand no matter how much money the county board of supervisors throws at it.\n\nThe county wants to be the Napa Valley of cannabis, and not naturally as it took place with Napa Valley, but in a rushed effort to capitalize on the legalization of cannabis. Hence the need to revisit the issue down the road to see whether the county is successful.",

The Humboldt weed myth is more about the 70s when a bunch of hippies went there after the 60s fallout. They were able to eek a living growing weed in the hills.",

You can get really good deals from dispensaries and local growers when they are trying to offload some of their older product. One thing thats super nice is how accepted it is up here. People smoke weed all over town and nobody seems to mind. If you choose humboldt, you'll be able to smoke as much as you want/can afford.",

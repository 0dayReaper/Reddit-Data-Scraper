I'd prefer to go someplace where activism and politics don't really dominate as they do in Berkeley. I could stand it, as I have for the past 17 years, but I want to know what to expect.

There is a liberal mindset here, but in all honesty it shouldnt bother you and if it does that probably requires some inward reflection. Everyone here just wants to be nice, inclusive, and independent in a way. Although you will find some devious folk if you catch my drift.",

The marketing and admin mottos of \u201cwhite privilege, colonialism and power/oppression\u201d is pretty disturbing. I think we\u2019ve come a very long way since the 1960\u2019s in terms of civil rights, and lean more towards the impression people are trying to get unequal advantage (I\u2019m less likely to get into a masters program because I\u2019m white, because of critical theories) and somehow that\u2019s justified. Why should I be punished for an ancestry I was never apart of? I have minority friends who don\u2019t see racism in any significant way, nor do they feel they\u2019re limited in the market place.\nInclusivity is a beautiful idea with college students and do not doubt at all that it\u2019s coming from a kind hearted place, until they dive a little bit deeper into what\u2019s actually happening in the administration, and why everyone is having this social justice zeitgeist. You have to read the books on critical theories, and understand why Marxism has destroyed every society that\u2019s ever attempted. Inclusively is great if you define it as love/compassion for others, but unequal opportunity to equal outcome is not great.",

Teaching a realistic history that gets a certain demographic of white people feeling uncomfortable, yeah for sure. Cal Poly Humboldt is very supportive of indigenous peoples from this region. You\u2019ll often hear your professors acknowledge whose land they are residing on. Very big on discussing white settler colonialism, the genocide caused, and how the systems in place still cause damage in modern times. But it\u2019s not about causing shame to white people. It\u2019s just the reality of history. Some white people get uncomfortable with it but that\u2019s more about that individual looking inward at why they\u2019re feeling that. Feeling guilt for things you didn\u2019t do is more of a personal issue. From reading your two posts on this thread I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll like it at the school overall. Arcata is very liberal and Humboldt county is predominately liberal. Some of the surrounding areas have conservative pockets. McKinleyville, Fortuna, Ferndale come to mind.",

The Spanish really did a ton of harm to the natives hundreds of years before colonists came, talk about genocide. \nI just think it\u2019s important to look at solid evidence to understand the truth of things, and I typically don\u2019t trust information without evidence, especially if it\u2019s politically motivated.",

The retention and graduation rate for white males at that university is massively downsizing, ofcourse this is to be expected as you wouldn't want to attend an institution that at every corner with an intellectualized fashion, tells you that you're evil.

Not sure if we\u2019d call it \u201cwoke\u201d, but understand that the progressives laid the foundations for an unconstitutionally based government in the late 1800\u2019s. Our government was originally never intended to be involved in the free market in any significant way. Corrupt corporations leverage politicians to serve their own interests, not the interests of us. It\u2019s a non representative aristocratic/oligarchical form of government the very thing we left Europe because of. We are paying for millions of office policy makers who are causing more harm than good to the economy, because they are not experts in the area they are trying to rule, this is why the common man since medieval times has hated bureaucracies. \nCorporations market based on pathological and misinformed pathos and ethos (appeal to emotion and appeal to morality). Not all sustainability and green marketing is doing anything for the planet. \n\nThe reason you would call it \u201cwoke\u201d is because a lot of this stuff is believed in by people who are highly progressive, people who support more and more government. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/syVgn6snM2I",

I can\u2019t speak for psychology because I\u2019m transfer for fall 2022,  (because full ride and incredible beauty of the area). Two psychology courses offered had some taint of social justice influence in their description. According to James Lindsay, psychology is one of the disciplines outside of woke grasp (in general across America) I\u2019m really hoping that\u2019s the case and it\u2019s nothing more than a chiwawa bite here. \nDuring their orientation, I was pretty disgusted when they were encouraging students to take  sustainability Econ classes with a basis in social justice ideology with key words \u201ccolonialism, white supremacy, power privilege and oppression etc\u201d. With all those same ideas from some guest speaker they were promoting. It\u2019s truly mind boggling how this became a thing in universities. Intelligent Professors really need to be the ones to take some administrative power to limit anti-intellectualism from happening. I think a lot of these woke departments are paid for by taxpayers as well. No good.\nI\u2019ve heard from students not to be too concerned about expressing any conservative views (I consider myself constitutionally conservative and classically liberal). I think mostly what your going to get is a-lot of well intentioned people with a lot of ignorance. If your major is saturated in social justice and leftist communist facade then obviously you would not want to go here. \nI was told that I\u2019m going to find conservatives  and not to be afraid to share my mind with professors in the psych program. I\u2019m not too concerned. You\u2019ll find intelligent peers if you go here. \nFor my particular major, it makes no difference which university I go to, so that\u2019s an important factor to keep in mind. Is the university going to set you up well for the career your going to build, more importantly is the degree REQUIRED, for what your going to do. If it\u2019s not, you live in the digital age, you could educate yourself better without paying for college. If your coming out of high school, interview your department and explore your desired career first, before accepting a university. So you don\u2019t get into massive debt and end up not using your major. Don\u2019t trust people to guide you blindly, is the best advice I can give if your young. \ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\uddd8\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

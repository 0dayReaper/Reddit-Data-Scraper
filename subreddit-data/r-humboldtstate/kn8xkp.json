Honestly I just suggest not mentioning that you have cats and just moving into a place. If they have any issues or complaints, show them your esa paperwork. \n\nI\u2019ve been living at my apartment for about a year and a half and got my cat about 7 months ago. No ESA paperwork or anything. The property manager has seen the cat multiple times and knows that the cat is in my apartment. She doesn\u2019t care and she hasn\u2019t said anything to the property management company. I live in the Campbell creek apartments.",

While school was still in person last year i knew like 5 people all without pets living with someone with a cat and they all HATED their roommate with the cat like a month in. To the point that they were resorting to really petty and gross things like leaving used tampons in plain sight and then comparing that to little bits of kitty litter. Little things that definitely don\u2019t bother cat owners, gross out people without cats. It\u2019s also sucked that most of these people are very happy to live with a dog they don\u2019t take care of. And I like dogs but they are way messier than cats. Not really the point. I hope that you don\u2019t have to deal with that but if you can, try to find a roommate that\u2019s down with cats AND has lived with one or taken care of one before. Don\u2019t stress about the property management companies. Also several people in my complex have dogs, and my neighbor has a giant pit, no ESA, no one cares.",

And yeah people get all worked about cats but in my opinion dogs are way more gross like atleast if a cat is pooping or peeing inside it\u2019s usually in a litter box but when a dog goes most the time they just go anywhere especially small dogs which are more prone to accidents and humping everything you own my moms has three dogs and they are all small dogs and no matter how many time she takes them out or even if she takes food and water away at specific times they still use the bathroom inside and they are trained her dog also would rip holes in my blankets and hump every blanket or pillow we owned. A lot of people don\u2019t even take care of their dogs they think dogs are better because oh it plays but cats do to!!! They loves toys and my Manx kitty plays fetch in the yard with me while my other kitty will do yoga with me",

It's far easier if you're renting a house.",

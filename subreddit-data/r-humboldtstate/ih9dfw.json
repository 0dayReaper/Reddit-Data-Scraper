It also says that this logging does not impact the status or progress towards having a perpetual easement with Trinidad Coastal Land Trust to allow for public access and a well kept trail.",

The timber company surely wants to demonstrate it takes reasonable measures to keep people off the property in the event a trespasser gets hurt on the property and fancies the idea of suing the company for the trespasser's own deliberate actions.\n\nBut people still read the news release thinking it says Strawberry Rock is 'temporarily closed' when the release clearly states people should not be on the property without permission.",

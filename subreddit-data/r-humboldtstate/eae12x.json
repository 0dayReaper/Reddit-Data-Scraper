    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI\u2019m interested in applying for the MS for environmental systems with a focus on Energy Technology and and Policy.\n\nAnyone here part of the engineering college and can speak for the quality, labs, resources etc? Any info would be much appreciated. \n\nAlso is there a big Graduate community there? It seems like it\u2019s disproportionately undergrads that attend. Can my 25 y/o self still fit in? \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "The engineering grad college is small and your profs will be the profs who teach undergrad classes. All the engineering classes you take will be mixed with undergrad engineering students. With that said, a good chunk of the *undergrad* engineering student body is around the age of 25, or older. Your age wouldn't hinder you \"fitting in\" in the slightest. I was friends with numerous older students during my time there.  \n\nThe professors are, for the most part, great. I recommend taking classes with the four \"og\" professors. They are the real deal. HSU is the oldest environmental engineering program in the country, and some of the current professors were students in the program when it started in the 70s. They really care about your education. \n\nYou will also have a individual project that spans your time in the masters program (your \"thesis\"), which can either be research based or design based (more of a \"project\" then research). I highly recommend you avoid seeking a thesis advisor who is a new/young professor. To be honest they have a long ways to go. \n\nI kind of thought the labs in the undergrad program were lackluster (other then the computer programming labs, which were the highlight of my time at HSU--and also extremely challenging). I think your experience as a grad student would be different if you sought out using the sediment transport flume they have (not many schools do). With that said, Humboldt county is full of opportunities for awesome environmental engineering grad student projects. Feel free to dm for some ideas.\n\nI also recommend really considering if you want to go into environmental engineering. The work in industry primarily consists of computer modeling work, writing environmental regulation, or sampling. Is that how you want to spend your career?",

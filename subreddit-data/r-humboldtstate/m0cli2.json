When I was trying to find a UDGE I sent an email to one of the top rated RMP Journalism professors and got chewed out because I wasn't a Journalism major. So I took the class of another Journalism professor that got a lot of heat on RMP, but in my opinion turned out to be amazing and me consider a minor in Journalism. What is wrong for one, can be right for another.",

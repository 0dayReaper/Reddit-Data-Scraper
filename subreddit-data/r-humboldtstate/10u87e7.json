I tried following the instructions from this link to activate my account ([https://its.humboldt.edu/accounts-passwords/activating-your-hsu-account](https://its.humboldt.edu/accounts-passwords/activating-your-hsu-account)), but when I do it says I need to enter my MyHumboldt account username (which I don't have BECAUSE I AM TRYING TO MAKE THE ACCOUNT SDSIDSHDSIDHS).\n\nCan someone please help me? I bet the solution is probably really simple, and I am just stupid. It's stuff like this that makes me doubt I am even worthy of college.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was the link the Activating my Humboldt Account webpage told me to go [http://welcome.humboldt.edu/new](http://welcome.humboldt.edu/new)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just do not understand. What is my Humboldt username?",

    "postText": "Hey there everybody, so I plan on transferring to HSU in the fall as a Computer Science major. I know environmental majors are popular here and I love the outdoors (especially Humboldt County) so my question is what would be a good minor? Forestry and Wildland Soil Science caught my attention. Anybody in those fields that could give me some insight? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Your top two choices (Wildlife &amp; Forestry) just got some pretty nice rankings (we believe we're #1, obv). The fire science folks are doing some truly critical work these days, too. There are few indoor fire labs in the US, HSU has one of them. \n\n[http://now.humboldt.edu/news/hsu-academic-programs-ranked-among-the-top-in-california/](http://now.humboldt.edu/news/hsu-academic-programs-ranked-among-the-top-in-california/)\n\nYou might take a look at Environmental Science as well. You'd get a well-rounded nature-oriented minor that could really compliment the CS skills.\n\n[https://environment.humboldt.edu/program-overview](https://environment.humboldt.edu/program-overview)\n\nThat said, we've got academic advisors who can help you figure the pros and cons.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm Elli! I just wanted to get myself out there a little bit because I'm an incoming transfer student and I'm honestly very nervous about the whole experience. I'm 19 years old studio art major, I use she/they pronouns, and I'm transferring in as a junior in the fall. I wanted to reach out to anyone who's into making some friends ahead of time and/or looking for possible roommate connections! I haven't had much luck finding like-minded people on other sites so I thought I might as well reach out here. Reach out to me on here or on my Instagram @ elfishbuglette !! :-)",

Hah) but I think you\u2019ll have a blast at HSU, and you\u2019ll find lots of friends I\u2019m sure. Not sure what orientation looks like with covid, but if you come up to do that in person, you\u2019ll meet lots of fellow students.",

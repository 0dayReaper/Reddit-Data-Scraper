    "postText": "Hey friends, I\u2019m missing my beloved water bottle. It\u2019s a 36 once Thermos brand water bottle that I have taken 2 years to carefully decorate and litter with stickers I love. I may have left it in BSS 4th floor or Founders hall. It has a groovy lid with a fancy little handle. As well a Toyon lit mag, Joe Biden \u201cI did that\u201d, Colorado, California, \u201chug your dog!\u201d And various dispensary stickers. If anyone could help me out I shall reward you!!! It\u2019s one of my favorite belongings. When I\u2019m alone in the world I know I can depend on my trusty water bottle. Any help would be  appreciated.\n\nEDIT: I found it!!!! In founders hall next to the bathroom lol. Thanks to @DenseMost108",

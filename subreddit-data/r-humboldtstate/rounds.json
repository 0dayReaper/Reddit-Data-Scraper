    "postText": "Y'all I need your help. I'm supposed to have more in person classes next semester, so I'm gonna need a better backpack. What do y'all recommend for all the rain we get? I'm from somewhere that it hardly rains, so I don't know where to start. Preferably I'd need enough room to carry a chromebook, a 3 in binder, and a notebook or 2 (at least, but the more room the better). Thanks for all your help!",

Definitely cheaper if you're trying to save a little dough.\n\nI like Swissgear backpacks. Lots of storage. Comes with a good warranty. Holds my laptop and extra screen along with books and school gear. All less than $100. Oh yeah... fits a double walled 32oz bottle on the side too.",

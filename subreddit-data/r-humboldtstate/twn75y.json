Unfortunately you can no longer add Cpoints at Dining locations.",

Ahh, good times.\n\nI dare say charging for printing made sense 20-ish years ago when it was free because students printed all manner of errata in an era when paper was still king. Before smart phones. Pagers were high tech. This was around the time they figured out how to charge for printing. I can't imagine students printing much non-class related material today. \n\nIt begs the question of whether printing academic-related material at a university is a right or a privilege.",

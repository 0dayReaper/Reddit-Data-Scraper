    "postText": "Hey guys, it's me again. I guess I'll keep it short again, since most of you probably already know what's going down. Next week it the week to commit to a college. Still, after many emails, I have not yet heard back about my admission status. So my last question on this most likely unsuccessful quest follows: Did any of you get into the BASW program and if so, when did you hear back? \n\nThanks again to everyone for all of their advice during this, personally, trying time with admissions. Although it is very likely at this point that I may not have the opportunity to attend based on the lack of communication on their end, I really know that this school, because of the students like you all, is a special place, and it will always be held dearly in my heart. I wish you all success and earnestly hope the best for you all.",

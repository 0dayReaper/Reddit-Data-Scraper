What can areas sub categories fall under forestry and what are my options? I know i'm asking a lot of questions but I just want to make sure I choose something that I'll love. Thanks everyone!",

            "comment": "Hey! I\u2019m a senior in forestry (hopefully) graduating by the end of this semester. \n\nMost of the professors are really great, and there\u2019s some really awesome people in the major. The Department really works to give you as many opportunities as possible in the field, which is something I appreciate. We also do a lot of hiking for labs and field trips in the forest which is super fun, and, really, if you want to study forestry, Humboldt is absolutely the place to do it. \n\nSome classes are suuuuper math-intensive, which isn\u2019t too fun for me, and it\u2019s definitely a challenging major. It\u2019s also really male dominated, which, if you\u2019re a girl like me, can make it harder to connect with people in the major; that being said, I always get along right away with any of the girls in my classes, since there\u2019s only like, three of us. \n\nI\u2019ve come to recognize that the major is really challenging for me, and while I think all the elements of it (professors, class environments, the department, labs &amp; field trips) make it fun, it has also caused me a LOT of stress and definitely triggered my impostor syndrome a couple times. But I recognize that the career(s) I get out of this (wildland fire, timber management, mapping, etc) are careers that are genuinely going to make me happy and are focused on work that I care about and value. So, for me, I might have been a happier college student majoring in literature or something, but I know I\u2019m going to be a lot happier with where my career/life is headed after college.\n\nHope that helps, remember this is just my experience\u2014 some people have a way easier time in the major, some way harder. \n\nFeel free to DM me :)",

Can you please give an example forestry course that had a math focused curriculum? I have finished all of my math courses needed for the major. Did your courses in your college career have lots of homework? Good luck finishing your last semester! Massive, wonderful achievement best of luck to you!!!!!",

That being said once you get the foundation for the math part set (mostly stats &amp; trig), the rest comes easier. \n\nHomework can include a lot of different things, lots of lab reports &amp; working with data management/excel, reading scientific journals/papers, and just some wrestling with hard ass equations/problems. \n\nHope that helps &amp; good luck!!",

With the Arcata Community forest right behind the school we have labs out there very often giving better experience and learning. PM me if you have any other specific questions and i\u2019m happy to help",

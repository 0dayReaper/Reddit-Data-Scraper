            "comment": "Honestly, I did not love it. I came from central cal. The housing was expensive for your own apartment. The people are nice for the most part, but if you aren\u2019t into smoking weed- then heads up- because it\u2019ll be around you constantly (people smoking, shops, ads). Also, I didn\u2019t like the crime, you can\u2019t leave anything in your car, because broken windows are a huge possibility for everyone. Also, the drugs. Eureka was so depressing to drive through, and I always felt I needed to look behind me everywhere I went/walked/hiked. The weather is cold, and it\u2019s usually overcast. And the drive just to get out of humboldt &amp; Mendocino takes 4 hours. Sorry to everyone reading thinking I\u2019m a sourpuss but\u2026 I was so glad to leave when I graduated.",

I tell people this place is a magical natural place.The economy and infrastructure is bad here hardly any jobs for everyone. There's a lot of white people here to, and racist. Anyone remember the huge trump rally in 2020 ?",

            "comment": "Not a wildlife or bio major but I\u2019m from south OC and went to Humboldt and fell in love the moment I saw the redwoods. I loved the weather, the community, the nature, the campus, and (most of) the professors I had. I loved my friends here but I was tired of SoCal and desperately wanted a change - partly why I decided on Humboldt. \n\nBIGGEST DRAWBACK: getting to and from HumCo from SoCal. Over the 4.5 years I attended, I mostly drove back to my hometown or took the Amtrak route (for every single break minus 1 or 2) and I flew twice. This was right before they implemented their own bus route that goes to LA (I think that\u2019s where it goes). The drives were fine with friends, ~13 hours done in one day. The airport there is tiny so flights get expensive, but if that\u2019s not a worry then flying is the easiest way in and out. Amtrak is rough but it gets you from A to B. \n\nHumboldt is a smaller area, more rural than suburban. If there were more jobs prospects there I would have stayed for longer. Getting to live and go to school in a redwood forest was magical enough for me. I\u2019m rambling but just wanted to offer my insight since I also left behind all of my friends in SoCal. It\u2019s fairly easy to make friends in your freshman year since everyone else is also trying to do the same, and as a bio/wildlife student you\u2019d find your people. \n\nGood luck, and congratulations on graduating!",

            "comment": "It depends how social you are. If you want a active social life and can afford it then Humboldt might not be for you. But if you live the simple life, and love the outdoors it's a nice place. Just not many food places,it's pricey, housing can be a nightmare, and there's always homeless people posted around town. I mean the experience is unique to everyone but if you're afraid of change. Think about it long and hard because Humboldt is a different world compared to socal. I'm from south LA and it's so different here. Also this place is ancient and people have mold problems frequently. Also be ready to buy rain gear.",

Personally ive found that there is always something going on to go check out and tons of clubs to get into. Shout out to Humboldt Home brewers and HARC.\n\nHousing being a nightmare, I fully agree with. I was lucky enough to get into a place and am holding onto it for as long as possible.",

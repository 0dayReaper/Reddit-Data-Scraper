                    "comment": "Is this roxannes Reddit account or are you satan? She\u2019s an awful teacher and that class is insanely difficult. So many people dropped the course. The textbook is not something you can find online for free, you have to pay for it. And guess who it\u2019s written by? \n\nThe quizzes were awful, you\u2019d read the chapter and then the quiz literally would ask questions about things not covered in the textbook (or her sub-par lectures). I\u2019ve never went to office hours before her class, but I was desperate and went to two of them where she was as useful as a bag of dog shit. I had two bio major friends that I kept asking for help and they would be lost. They had a hard time with it. They would also point out how things weren\u2019t consistent, and they would pull out other textbooks that would describe the same term completely differently. \n\nThat class also fulfills an upper division science area that Ecotopia with Jack Murphy covers. The class isn\u2019t easy but it\u2019s much easier than the bio class, and jack is a really good professor. Honestly, out of all the classes that fulfill that area requirement, human genetics with Roxanne is the worst. I\u2019ve taken 4 of those classes and human genetics was five or six times worse than any of those classes. I took it online, maybe in person it\u2019s a completely different experience, although I really can\u2019t imagine that.",

I was a business major so I didn\u2019t really have much science background, but I just really did not find it that hard. I got an A in it and didn\u2019t really put in much study time for it. I\u2019m not sure if you took it virtually or not, I took it in person maybe 2-3 years ago, so maybe that is why. All the quiz and test questions were directly in the notes from her power points. I don\u2019t think I actually ever read the book, just paid attention to her slides. I found it to be the easiest upper division GE that I took. The least pleasant part about it was having it at 8am in founders hall.",

(2 members total out of dozens of teachers I\u2019ve learned from starting since pre k). \n\nHer powerpoints were not helpful at all and the textbook that she wrote and forces you to buy (you don\u2019t have the option to not buy it because it contains her quizzes) is also awful. The textbook is new. The online lectures were awful, and every single breakout room we had, at least 1 other person would complain about her or her confusing instructions. \n\nI\u2019m glad you enjoyed the class because learning is fun, but your class was in person and mine was online. The class is online next semester. More than half the class dropped and most of the people that stayed had serious complaints about her teaching methods and the class material. I would strongly urge op and every HSU student to avoid that class.",

I graduated just in time to not really have to deal with online classes apart from a semester. It seems as though some teachers just really could not carry over to online teaching.",

            "comment": "JMC 306 with Kirby Moss isn't the most laid back, but I find it interesting as someone who isn't a journalism or communications major. I took the equivalent of that class before I transfered (mass media history) so I thought it would be mostly review, but Dr. Moss has overhauled the curriculum to be entirely focused on how historically misrepresented people have told their story through different forms of media. There's a \"research essay\" due each Wednesday where you read the articles and maybe watch a movie or read a textbook chapter and write a short 250 word paper answering the questions he poses with reference to the material and a citation for your own outside research. The Sunday discussions are pretty laid back and you aren't expected to actually reply to other student's posts, just read a few. There's 2 big projects for the midpoint and end of the semester. So far he seems like an easy grader.\n\nOnly issue is that it's a completely online asynchronous class so you don't really get to interact with anyone and you need to be self driven to keep yourself on schedule. The professor also hasn't ever responded to my emails or made himself available for office hours, so you're kinda on your own there. But overall the class is chill and I'd recommend it as something interesting you can fit into a busy schedule.",

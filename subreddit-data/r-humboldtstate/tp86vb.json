    "postText": "I\u2019m thinking about taking Biol 105 during the summer session. It\u2019s with Montgomery, but I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s only about 5 weeks long (2nd summer session 6/27-7/29) meeting Tuesday and Thursday for both lab and lecture. For a 4 unit science core class, I would think it would be the full summer length of 10 weeks but it isn\u2019t? That seems really short and fast. Anyone take that during summer, was it doable or should I wait to take regular length semester course?",

Also very laid back, I didn't get the feeling that he'd freak out if you needed a deadline extension or something.\n\nBiol 105 is also not very difficult, it's an introductory course, just giving you the basic building blocks for further sciences you may take or filling your requirement as a non major. So the lessened time shouldn't be too bad. I am a bio major tho and love the subject so take that with a grain of salt lol.",

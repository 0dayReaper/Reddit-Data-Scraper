So you might work for several years after high school, scrimping and saving, in order to afford housing away from your childhood home. That's assuming you have the luxury of being able to stay in your childhood home after high school. And of course do your first two years of college at a local community college to further save money.\n\nMy advice for new parents is to enroll their kids in a language immersion elementary/middle/high school so their child will be fluent in a second language by the time they graduate high school, and then consider establishing residency in virtually any other country where higher education is dramatically less expensive, or even free. That's not really advice for you. I just had to throw in a dig at America's perverse model for higher education that it isn't free or extremely low cost. We live in a broken system that extends well beyond how higher education is handled.",

They barely let Pomona do it and they would really rather that they not. So I\u2019ll be very interested to see what kind of actual branding they come out with, because something like Humboldt Polytechnic probably would have been better. And if I\u2019m being totally honest, the name change, As an outsider, feels pretty superficial. Cal poly, at the end of the day, is still a CSU. All of the stuff that they wanted to do could have simply been done without needing to rebrand the university, so\u2026Yeah. Anyway, I don\u2019t think it really matters in the grand scheme of things, but I\u2019ll be interested to see what happens and especially how Brandon will be handled because of the issues I have mentioned.",

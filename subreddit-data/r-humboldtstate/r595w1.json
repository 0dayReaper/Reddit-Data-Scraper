Still have no idea how tf that happened. The burglar must've had some connection to the victim to know where to look for both the keys and the car.\n\nEdit: Found a [news article](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2021/aug/24/suspect-of-multiple-arcata-area-burglaries-arreste/?fr=operanews) on the story. Doesn't look like the type of dude who students would be hanging out with.",

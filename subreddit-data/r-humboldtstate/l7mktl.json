    "postText": "Hello out there! I am a misplaced Californian who got thrown to wind and landed in Omaha, nebraska in 2014 with my mom when I was 20yo. I attempted to move home for good last March, ironically the day y\u2019all were first to declare shelter in place. Historically bad timing. After 3 months, hanging my head in defeat, I moved back to NE last summer to find a job/housing and just go to University of Nebraska Omaha. \n\nBut, I got into HSU fall \u201821 and I want to cry I\u2019m so happy to have another foot out the door of this shithole state.\n\nI will be turning 27 in august when semester starts, studying cell/molec bio, aspiring to be a clinical lab technologist one day, but in the meantime I\u2019m another bartender/waitress until I get my undergrad. \n\nI\u2019m a junior (credit wise) but still have 2-2.5 years to graduate. If I stay at UNOmaha, my expected graduation is fall \u201823, and if I accept the transfer to HSU, it might add like a semester and I\u2019d graduate in 2024.\n\nThat said ...... I\u2019m terrified. I know humboldt is affordable..not much more than Omaha tbh. Out of state tuition is ONLY $100 more per credit than I pay here. Seems I can find a room for about $500/mo. But I know how Covid culture is out there, and I am skeptical about housing/work being inaccessible like it was last spring. \n\nReddit fam, I don\u2019t want to live in nebraska for 2-3 more years. What are my odds of finding housing and making a living on part time work?",

I would however set your assumed price point at $650. Thats more reasonable for a quality room. There is a lot of god awful housing here.\n\nJobs suck in Humboldt as well and students don't find them easily. The Marijuana industry is huge, but it isn't one that students are much of a part of. Growers need you on the hill and have demanding hours. Many are not legal, which also means you don't have financial security with them.\n\nTrimming is always an option, but not too many growers will let you trim at home unless they know you well or have a good reason to trust you. Also, trimming is definitely boring and not a rewarding experience. You could be really slow at it or just plain bad. You could also be really good at it. In which case, it can be a very well paid gig.\n\nAs far as attending in the fall, I personally would wait a semester. Spring 2022 should be entirely back to normal. Maybe try to move in the summer, find work, and then go back to school in the spring.\n\nThe county and the region has much to offer by way of outdoor activities and recreation and beautiful scenery. You can paddle board the Humboldt Bay, mountain bike in Redwood Park, and climb at many excellent boulders and rock faces. If you haven't ever surfed, you can definitely cut your teeth here.\n\nOur rivers are slices of heaven in the summer and the beaches are pristine year round.\n\nA lot of students come here not just for the school, but for the pot. There's probably no place in the world that has the type of stoner/Marijuana community we do. You won't find better deals or more acceptance anywhere. If you can sell pot to any people you know that aren't from Humboldt, you have the potential to make plenty of money and you won't have to worry about the busyness of work affecting your schooling time.\n\nI think the only thing left to say in my opinion is that we are far away from any major metro areas and the hospitals here are understaffed and overworked. They also are fairly basic in what medical care they provide. If anything serious or complicated happens, you're likely driving to SF. Hopefully not being helicoptered. \n\nFeel free to PM me with any questions, I've been here 10 years, am 28, and have learned this community very well.",

Especially if you have experience with multiple machines and processes. \n\nI have had more than a few friends hold those types of positions at St Joseph's.\n\nThe hours are probably worse than the bar hours though. \n\nThey always have you coming in at varying intervals for both night and early morning shifts in the lab. Not always fun to finish work at 3pm then have to be back at 12am some days.",

But it\u2019s easy to go to places and shop safely. The businesses around tend to keep things at least safe enough. It\u2019s just the individual people you have to watch out for and the areas they hang out.  Job wise, there\u2019s always a job in the weed or dispensary area but I have seen quite a few businesses in Arcata at least, that are looking for more employees. \n\nI think if you do the research and reach out, you\u2019ll find yourself able to make it here. Plus HSU has a off campus living coordinator that helps a lot and she will sometimes also help direct you to finding jobs.",

I lived in the bay which I know is nothing like arcata or the rest of nor cal, but finding housing in the bay was literally impossible if they didn\u2019t know you during these times. Also, not that I want to work in bars anymore, but the income is reliable, so I\u2019ll ask, how\u2019s the bar and restaurant scene there? I\u2019d be down for dispensary work too.

We should be re-opened and hiring for all those in person positions be the end of summer if not sooner. I dont expect it before June though. It may be longer if the pandemic takes a strange turn.\n\nThat being said, we aren't expected to have most of Humboldt Vaccinated until late summer. \n\nIt is definitely a developing situation.",

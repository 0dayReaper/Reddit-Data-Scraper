I did not find the course challenging, but reading the chapter and doing the activities can take some time.  I found the activities start off NOT taking how long they say it will, but later they absolutely do. So be prepared for 6 hour activities practicing using ArcGIS.  Ultimately, if geography and thinking about space (on earth) intrigue you, then it'll fly by and you'll have a chance at enjoying the final project as I did. I found Dr. Rock to be a quality teacher.  I would have stayed in the program, but I'm looking to incorporate GIS and spatial data with public health work.  I'd say give it a shot!",

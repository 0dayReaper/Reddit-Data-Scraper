Just walk up to a human teller and tell em you want $20 worth of quarters in exchange for the $20 bill in your hand. You'll get two $10 rolls of quarters.\n\nThe closest bank is Redwood Capital Bank at 1315 G Street.\n\nIf they surprise me and want you to be a member to exchange currency, you can definitely do it at US Bank at 953 G Street. And walking from Redwood Capital to US Bank, you'll pass three other banks along the way.\n\nIf you're in a pinch after banks are closed, one might bring a laundry basket with some clothes in it to a laundromat. Then walk past the watchful laundromat attendant and up to the coin change machine in the laundromat, insert some dollar bills, get some quarters, then, umm, pick up your laundry basket and leave. I wouldn't know anything about that though. *cough*",

    "postText": "This is my first semester at Humboldt (I'm a transfer student from SoCal-currently a junior). I was really looking forward to moving up and getting a change of pace, but I decided to stay home this semester to save some money, since everything's online. So far the classes have been alright, but I'm really missing in person labs and feeling a little disconnected from everything. I'm hoping that some labs will be in person for the spring. I've been thinking about moving up in January and applying to live on campus.\n\nIs this a good idea? For those who are living on campus, what's it like? What building would you recommend I put as my first choice? \n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit to add: I can\u2019t take a year off, as I already deferred my cal grant to attend my local community college, and I am only eligible for 1.5 more years.",

It\u2019s the newest housing on campus and defiantly the nicest from all the other ones I\u2019ve been in. Right now it\u2019s nice since there\u2019s only one person per bedroom. Not much opportunity to meet new people though. Luckily I\u2019m living with two of the guys from last year and my third roommate is good too. Some people say they don\u2019t like their roommates and that really sucks for them since there\u2019s not a ton of socializing going on. You aren\u2019t allowed to have guests otherwise you get in trouble and have to talk to the guy in charge of housing. We got in trouble for having roommates girlfriend over. So in that sense it sucks. Won\u2019t be living on campus next year for sure. Unless you really just want to get away from home and want to see the area then I would say it\u2019s not worth it. These are just my opinions but feel free to message me if you have any questions",

Good that you get along well with your roommates though. Regarding on campus living I was kinda torn between college creek and creekview, so it\u2019s helpful to know that college creek is a little nicer.   I think the only face-to-face lab class I would have next semester would be Watershed 310",

I know he had some health problems last semester but he\u2019s super smart. I would say HSU isn\u2019t taking it serious. We got in trouble before they sent out the email about no guest and since then we will see big groups of people walking by and the RAs don\u2019t do anything about it. You can walk around on the weekends and hear music playing and a bunch of people talking so idk what\u2019s up with that. The housing guy told us in the zoom meeting with him that you can hang out with your friends and whatnot but you can\u2019t do it in the dorm, you gotta go someplace else or on the field so idk. Everyone got tested twice when we moved in but they haven\u2019t done anymore testing so who knows what\u2019s happening. I haven\u2019t heard about any cases but there\u2019s always a possibility. They said that if you leave for thanksgiving you can\u2019t come back so there\u2019s that. Not sure how they will enforce it though. Idk I just hang out with the same small group of people and calling it good",

I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been bummed about college life- I can definitely empathize, even though I\u2019ve been at home. Hopefully things look up next year. If I end up moving up in the spring, I would love to do some cool outdoor stuff with you! That\u2019s one of my main incentives to go right now, so having someone to do that with would be really nice",

I did get one good roommate though. As far as friends, I haven\u2019t made many its hard with really nothing going on. I am happy to take a break away from my home in SoCal as it was tense. But if online school continues for next year I will be staying home because theres nothing to do unless you already have friends pre-covid. With that said my dorm has a room open for next semester. If you do wanna come up here I would establish trying to get housing with someone on reddit so you\u2019re not jumped into random people. Good luck on whatever you choose~\n\nEDIT: I also think there might be less in person classes added next semester and most of the labs (that in my opinion should be in person) are not. So I would consider that if that is one of your draws to living on campus.",

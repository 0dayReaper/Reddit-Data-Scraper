    "postText": "I am looking at my financial aid and I have enough to cover this semester. However I am worried because I got an email saying that one of my awards would not be available until the 17th and the other part of my financial aid hasn\u2019t gone through yet. Part of my fees say they are already due and the rest are going to be due on the 15th. Should I be concerned about paying or being cancelled from my classes? I am supposed to move in next week and I suppose I am just trying to make sure I will be fine because my aid should cover everything.\n\nAlso should I try to email financial aid to ask? I have heard people from this subreddit saying they aren\u2019t really responsive right now so I\u2019m not sure how to best contact them.\n\nThank you",

You can find their e-mail address on the Humboldt State website!  \nHope this helps!  \nHave a great semester.",

You can try reaching out to financial aid, but I wouldn\u2019t really worry about it unless they reach out to you. Colleges are great about seeking out payment! As long as your pending aid covers everything, you\u2019ll be fine.",

Are all calls going to voice mail and a worker periodically checks voice mail?\n\nIf all calls go to voice mail, then I would send the e-mail instead and provide detailed information and a phone number to receive a call back.",

I feel like I read that somewhere on their website. I hope you hear back, I think they are just very delayed. if you havent been cancelled from classes they are probably just still working on it considering I got mine today and in the night.",

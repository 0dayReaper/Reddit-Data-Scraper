            "comment": "The department chair for forestry sent this today \n\n Dear students, there are two possible responses of HSU to the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe first is that HSU continues what it is presently doing, which is\u00a0proceed with classes as normal, but closely monitor the spread along with local health authorities.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe second possibility is that the university substitutes on-line for face-to-face lectures. The obvious advantage of this is that the risk of infection is reduced dramatically. In this scenario, the course content is delivered on-line by your professors and there are no field trips. Whether\u00a0this reliance on internet instruction would last a few weeks or all semester cannot be known in advance. We are still waiting to hear whether the university will adopt this approach. In any case, you would finish all your classes this semester;\u00a0the semester would not be extended and\u00a0no one that passed the course\u00a0would have to repeat a course because of this disruption.\u00a0\n\n\nTo summarize, we do not yet know which approach HSU will take, as it continues consultation with local health authorities. In the meantime, keep an eye on updates at this site:\n\nhttps://covid19.humboldt.edu/\n\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\nDr. David F. Greene, Chair, Professor\nDepartment of Forestry and Wildland Resources\u00a0\nHumboldt State University",

I wonder how people are going to support themselves if that happens and whether tuition will be refunded to give the students a stipend to live on.",

Especially school staff like dining, tutoring, and admissions, etc. I know we would probably get online classes from what I heard, but capstone and lab classes will be difficult to do that way. It would be nice if this occurs that the university would give some form of compensation. I suppose we\u2019ll see.",

We are not currently aware of any COVID-19 cases on campus, but realize the global situation is changing rapidly. Therefore, we are asking faculty to work with their chairs in making contingency plans in the event of a partial or full campus closure. In the event of a prolonged closure, we are sharing with you some resources to support you in ensuring continuity of instruction and maintaining student engagement and learning.\n\nThere's more. Read that [here](https://covid19.humboldt.edu/news/message-faculty-covid-19).\n\nWhen we know more it'll go up to the HSU Covid site. \n\nUntil then, we encourage you to wash your hands, stay home if sick, and look out for each other.",

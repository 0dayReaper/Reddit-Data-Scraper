Future phases of CSUCCESS could include returning students. For now, returning students can borrow other technology or keep existing equipment loans from last semester!

The need is real. I've read about students writing term papers on their phones. And yes, even a phone might be one provided through the federal Lifeline cell phone program.\n\nThat said, your saying the funding comes from tuition is disingenuous. While the funding sources differ from campus to campus, it's a mix of savings and reserve funds, allocations from the state budget, and reimbursed money received from revenue lost during the pandemic.\n\nIf you know differently, and have thumbed through the budget for this program at HSU, I'm all for you educating me.",

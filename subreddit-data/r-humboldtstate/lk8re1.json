            "comment": "In my recollection, they were pretty rough compared to other locations on campus. Besides being old, cramped, and rundown, they also lacked a lot of features of newer housing like central heating. Although I didn't have any myself, I knew several people who had bug/pest problems at Campus Apartments too. Not to mention I often had to walk to the library to load a web page because the wifi signals couldn't penetrate the concrete walls. \n\nIf you can find a way to afford it, the extra you pay to live in College Creek is more than worth it for the extra space, central HVAC, fast wifi, and general morale boost of not living in what often felt like the lovechild of a county jail and a $40/night motel.\n\nAll that being said, plenty of people live there and are fine with it, but I would never recommend it.\n\nSource: Lived in Campus Apartments for a semester before moving to College Creek.",

Things are run down and old, I have had ants crawl through cracks in my wall, and the kitchen is a reasonable size for like one person only (two is a squeeze). Heater is controllable, but also overpowered so you have to turn it off and on and cant have a consistent temperature (no sleeping with it on). Perks for me is that I share a kitchen with one person and that I have my own bathroom. If its single occupancy and privacy is a priority for you, they aren\u2019t a bad choice, otherwise look at college creek or creek view.",

I could have sworn the talk at the time was they were going to tear down or retrofit or do something to campus apartments after college creek got going. Those were known as the worst dorms on campus 8 years ago. Can't imagine how much worse they are now.",

Def recommend college creek or the ones on top of the hill (forgot the name.) Honestly tho living off campus was way better for me and cheaper too.",

They are in a good spot however, being close to the library and just about center of campus. A lot of people recommend college creek, I do too, but if it's out of the question then creekview is great as well. It's on the top of the hill and feels a little secluded but that's part of the reason some of us moved here. It does take a walk to get places and always an uphill walk back to your room but the freshman 15 is a negative number up there.",

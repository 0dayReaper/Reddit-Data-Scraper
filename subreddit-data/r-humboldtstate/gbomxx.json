They are starting to implement the rules that you should be wearing a face mask when you are outside your residence and they recommend that you stay 6ft from anyone else. Restaurants are take-out only and nothing is really open. Other than that you are clear to walk around, just be careful. PM me and I\u2019ll tell you a few places you must check out if you do come see the school.",

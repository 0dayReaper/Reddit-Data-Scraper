    "postText": "I'm currently in high school in Minnesota looking around at colleges, and I was wondering what the wildlife program here entails and if anyone would recommend it? What do the classes look like? How often is fieldwork involved? Would you say going here is worth it? How well-funded are the programs?\n\nKinda a turn in questions, but what is the art program like? I'm teetering back and forth between art and wildlife, and I'm interested in both atm. \n\nI would also like to know what the buildings at Humbolt are like. Are they new/more modern on the inside or are they older and more run down? Are the dorms a good place to be? Is finding a place to study ever a problem?\n\nAlso, is there anything I should know about this college? any problems you wished could be fixed, or other more positive things? Are students often involved around campus?",

It's a very well received program and I've met a ton of wildlife biologists outside of humboldt (like at conferences or in the field) that are alumni.\n\nAs for field work, you get some in 311 (wildlife techniques). But you need to apply vigorously throughout the year for summer work. \n\nIf you go to the career center and get your resume written up, you will succeed. Dont be afraid of your professors, they are there to help. Please lmk if you have anymore questions I'd be happy to answer :)",

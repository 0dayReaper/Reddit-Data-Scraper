    "postText": "Hi! I'm most likely going to be studying Computer science this fall. I have never taken calculus and only went up to precalc in high school and precalc-algebra my first year of college at csulb. I got an a in both mostly just by asking other students and the teacher for extensive help, which you can't really do as easily in a college class lol. I will probably get tutoring but idk if that is available during covid. I have autism, I'm very smart and I like math, I just have auditory processing issues when it comes to complex explanations of things. Even if I place into math 109 I will most likely just take math 102 first to brush up on precalc. Do you guys think this will be enough help? What else can I do to prepare for math 109? Who here has taken math 109 that is maybe not so fond of math or not good at math? Do you have any advice? And maybe any info on what teachers are best!!",

They all WANT us to succeed, and I have found that most, if not all, will go above and beyond to help us learn the material.",

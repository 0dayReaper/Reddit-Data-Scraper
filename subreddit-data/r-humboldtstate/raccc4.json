    "postText": "Hello, I'm looking to attend HSU starting in Fall 2022. I wasnted to know more about what there is to do in and around Arcata. I love live music and mountain biking. I saw that there is a mountain biking club so I'll definitely be checking that out. What's the music scene like? Are there a good number of venues? What kinda music is there? Any metal? Also curious about stuff to do in general. I know its not the biggest town which is cool, and I like hiking as well and love the redwoods so I know there's plenty to do in that department. \n\nThanks! \n\nLooking at either a wildfire or philosophy major.",

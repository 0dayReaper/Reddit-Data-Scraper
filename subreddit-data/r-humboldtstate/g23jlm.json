If you've got any advice about good areas, places to avoid, etc, I'd love to hear them! Do some  students live in Eureka or other surrounding towns, or are they too far?",

It\u2019ll save you money instead of buying parking pass or driving to uni every day. If you\u2019re going to park at the 4 hour zones, be careful! The ticket police do not play (seriously they have no chill!!). Anyways, you\u2019ll develop some strong legs after walking so many damn hills haha\n\nI have a couple buddies paying for a studio for  about 750 a month, I believe the apartment is called Parkway Apartment. It\u2019s a mile away from uni.",

            "comment": "Eureka to Arcata is a 15 minute drive from the north end of Eureka. HSU is up to a 30 minute drive from Eureka, depending on how deep into Eureka you live.\n\nMcKinleyville is a 10 to 15 minute drive (depending on your proximity to Highway 101).\n\nBlue Lake is a 15 minute drive.\n\nPsychologically, Eureka is a good distance from campus. At first you'll enjoy the scenic commute. Eventually, you'll get on Humboldt Time and that scenic commute will make you not want to spend time in a car, and the drive will seem longer.\n\nRent is highest in Arcata because of the university. HSU is projecting lower enrollment next year, so on-campus housing might not be difficult to obtain (I don't know).\n\nIf you're a freshman, I highly recommend living on campus for at least your first year. You'll establish friendships the easy way (living in close proximity to other freshmen, all suddenly not knowing anyone and wanting to make friends fast). Some will be life-long friends.\n\nSome rentals are listed on [Places4Students.com](https://www.places4students.com/Places/School?SchoolID=P%2BA8MQ%2BdSFY%3D), the one listing service the [HSU Housing Liaison](https://housing.humboldt.edu/resident-resources/off-campus) links to besides Craigslist.\n\nYou can also google for [\"property management\" and \"city name\"](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=%22property+management%22+arcata) to find companies that offer rentals. Bookmark the sites and visit them again and again.\n\nI don't know where most students live off-campus, but it's a good bet the majority live in Arcata. Then some live in McKinleyville, then Blue Lake, and perhaps Eureka last. There are houses for rent in between each of these towns as well. \n\nBe sure you read the scam rental listing link on the Housing Liaison's website. I would not rent from anyone advertising on Craigslist. Go through a real property management company that has a real office in a local town.",

            "comment": "Hey Hey! Santa Cruz native and HSU graduate here! I find that most students live either in Arcata proper or out in Mckinleyville. Many rent in Sunny Brae as well, which is basically Arcata just a little furthur out. I'm sure some live in Eureka too, but it is easier to get to school from Mckinleyville or if you are already in Arcata. Housing is hard to procure on your own, so get a crew together to rent a house or be prepared to look early and hard for an apartment of not great quality. I like sunny brae since it is quieter than Arcata and the housing is generally of higher quality. Mckinleyville near the Hammond trail is very pretty with parks and ocean views, but you will be culturally separated form your fellow students as MKV is fairly conservative.",

                    "comment": "&gt;Sunny Brae as well, which is basically Arcata\n\nWell, Sunny Brae *is* Arcata, being located within the [city limits](https://www.cityofarcata.org/DocumentCenter/View/210/Arcata-City-Limits-PDF). It's merely a neighborhood name. It had greater meaning 50 or 100 years ago when the area was less developed.\n\nA variety of other neighborhood place names are in that linked map.  It's not like in McKinleyville, where some people who live in the Dow's Prairie area always clarify with a person that they live in Dow's Prairie, not McKinleyville (yeah, it's still McKinleyville). That has more to do with longtime large land owners distinguishing they are separate from residential owners who live 'in the downtown' or 'the city'.",

Like u/nix_that said, there\u2019s a website in the works for the clubs. They used to be on OrgSync, but they\u2019re switching over to their own site this year. \n\nA lot of the clubs are on Instagram. If there\u2019s any specific club you\u2019re interesting in, check to see if they have an account.",

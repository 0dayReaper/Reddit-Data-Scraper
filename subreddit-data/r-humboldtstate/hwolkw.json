    "postText": "I am at a community college looking to transfer to Humboldt State. I have read online they plan to re-open in the spring. I will have all my classes done after spring 2021 and so I am debating if I should enroll for summer 2021 or fall 2021. Is the campus still very active in the summer? Are there a lot of classes and stuff to do. Or does it kind of shut down? Are there any advantages to starting in the fall like most students? Any input appreciated (geology major if that\u2019s relevant)",

What you think is the case may change as the infection rates locally and in the state change.\n\nI'm not a university employee, but I'll take a stab at your questions two ways -- assuming conditions similar to today, and assuming normalcy. The unspoken third path is where the pandemic is worse than today and restrictions are tighter.\n\nFor summer 2021:\n\nIf similar to summer 2020, the campus is closed to the public. Most classes are conducted online. Limited courses that necessitate in-person instruction are offered. Community events are canceled. Very little in the way of entertainment takes place, except that which you create for yourself -- hiking, kayaking, bike riding, etc.\n\nIf summer 2021 returns to normalcy, there are a variety of community events held, a music scene in local entertainment venues, etc. The summer is low key compared to fall and spring semesters because fewer students are around, but stuff still happens. Fewer courses are offered. Certainly, there are big community events HSU students don't ever experience unless they spend a summer here. The [Kinetic Sculpture Race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI-VmrQwMtA) is a prime example. Youtube has races from around the country, but the race was founded in Humboldt.",

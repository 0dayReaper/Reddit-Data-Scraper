    "postText": "Hey my name is rae, I am 28f, attending cal poly humboldt for the first time, and I\u2019m seeking an apartment/studio/roomate flat to join. This is my first time in humboldt, I enjoy painting, fire dancing, gaming, and meditation. I\u2019m seeking a place to call my own as I attend school for wildlife management. If you need a roomate, know of a flat, or need a roomate, feel free to message me.",

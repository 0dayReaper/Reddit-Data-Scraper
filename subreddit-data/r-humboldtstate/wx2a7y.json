    "postText": "Mods can totally remove if this isn't the place to ask but I'm a potential Environmental Studies transfer to Cal Poly Humboldt (dang just in time for the name change!) and I've always been really interested in attending university way out north and on the coast. \n\nWhen I was younger my dad warned me that if I went to CSU Humboldt like he did it would be nothing but straight rain and gloom and depression. I'm betting he's being a little dramatic about it but I've got some mad anxiety and I'd love to hear from some actual students in this century and know what they think of the classes, the culture, the scenery and all of that.\n\n\nWhat's your take? What do you like and what don't you like? Is it going to be chill or am I going to jump off the bluffs into the ocean by week 2?  -E\n\n*edit: hey thank you so much for getting back to me. I\u2019ll keep browsing the sub and visit a few more times but I get the impression there\u2019s still a lot of fun to be had at CPH rain or shine especially for people like me who get a kick out of strange trees / rocks / fish / beer / people*",

It doesn\u2019t rain nearly as much. But if you\u2019re looking to frolic at the beach without a coat, well it may not be for you.",

Short answer: not rainy and cloudy enough for me in Humboldt.  Wish I could transplant Seattle climate onto the culture of Humboldt then it would be my dream home.  Love my time at the college.  If you're coming from a populated part of California, expect kickbacks (not parties) and do not expect many concerts.  Move to Humboldt for good vibes, good views, and hiking.",

            "comment": "Although being here in Humboldt can feel way more dreary and depressing than other CSUs along the coast, thanks to our proximity to the PNW and for being so isolated from other major cities, climate change has really done a number on the amount of rainy/foggy days we've had so it's truly not as bad as it was 20+ years ago.\nIf you live a bit further inland than directly on the coast near the school (so think the further inland areas of Eureka or Mckinleyville rather than Arcata or Manila), you'll probably get to experience drier, less foggy weather.\nAll that being said, we don't get a lot of sunlight up here and overcast skies are commonplace even in the summertime, and you WILL need to take vitamin D supplements in order to prevent depression from settling in. I've heard many people describe the weather and overall atmosphere up here similar to how Twilight feels. Ultimately I think it's a matter of perspective: if you love overcast, cool, wet weather, this place will be an amazing experience for you during your time in college, and it'll make you appreciate the once-in-a-while sunny days we have. However if you like bright sunlight and hot weather, this may not be the right school for you.",

No sunburn, but I'm still tan after June and July at the river in willow creek. I had my share of 100 degree days like the rest of California (about 45 min drive from campus). I'm all for these gloomy, sprinkling days in summer. \n\nThere's rivers, beaches, mountains, sunshine when you want it and coastal breeze all in the same day. Wouldn't trade it for anything else.",

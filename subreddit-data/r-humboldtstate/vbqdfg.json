    "postText": "hi! i\u2019m a 19 year old from los angeles transferring to humboldt this fall as a junior. i submitted my housing application a little late (my fault lol i know that was stupid) so i was waitlisted for on campus housing. i\u2019m 59 on the waitlist and my place hasn\u2019t moved at all in the past few weeks so i feel like it\u2019s pretty unlikely i\u2019ll get housing. right now im looking for places off campus and people to room with. im pretty easy going and love to crochet and thrift in my free time, and i\u2019d love to be close with my roommates :) if anyone is interested please feel free to reach out asap!! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc",

Squeaky wheel gets the grease!",

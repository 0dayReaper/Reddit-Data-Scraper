I would love to have my partner visit me from time to time, but I am unsure how many times they can do that and for how long.\n\nAlso I am also curious as to how strict the rules are. Thank you for your time!",

Typically the guest policy is that a registered guest can stay up to 3 consecutive nights, and up to 10 nights throughout the academic year.  Most policies can be found in the [Reslife &amp; You Handbook](https://housing.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/handbook.pdf), but feel free to email [housing@humboldt.edu](mailto:housing@humboldt.edu) if you have questions.",

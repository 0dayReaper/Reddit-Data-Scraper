    "postText": "Hello everyone:) ! I'm a prospective student at Humboldt State and was wondering what people's takes on how beneficial having a car is there. Overall would you recommend bringing one or does the alternative transportation methods suffice? Anyone have any specific experiences having a car (like positives about it, gas prices, theft, parking passes, etc.) / not having a car (getting around, saving money, frustrations about it, etc.) Thank you!",

I didn't need a car in the 1990s when the campus bookstore was still located on campus and stocked all the essentials a student would need to travel off-campus for. It was a bit like a CVS pharmacy, without the pharmacy. Prescriptions were obtained at the Health Center.\n\nFood was easy because every residence hall was within easy walking distance of the Jolly Giant Commons cafeteria and everyone had a meal plan. \n\nThere were even two barbers/hair stylists on campus in the University Center. Pre-web, there was also a travel agency on campus.\n\nToday, to reduce off-campus travel, be near the cafeteria by living in The Canyon, Cypress, or The Hill. Or live in College Creek Apartments, which are closest to a grocery store and the north part of Arcata when walking off-campus. Make friends with students who have cars.",

Gas prices blow, parking on campus sucks if you're not there by 7:50am, but insurance is a bit cheaper than other areas of California of you update your garaging address.  I'd say if you have a car, bring it, but don't but a car just to bring to campus.",

    "postText": "Hi! I am a upcoming freshman and I was in my high school's marching band and wind ensemble, I love music, but didn't want to major in music. Are there any Wind ensembles on campus that are open to non music majors? And is there a marching band? I've found info on wind ensembled on campus but only really saw stuff for music majors. If there is one, where can I audition? Thanks!",

The ensembles, that I know of, that are available to non-music majors are:  \n* [Calypso Band](https://music.humboldt.edu/calypso) - meets weekly as a class in the Department of Music, and is open to both music majors and non-majors alike.  \n* [Humboldt Symphony](https://music.humboldt.edu/humboldt-symphony-1) - Students must pass an audition in order to participate, and both music majors and non-majors are welcomed.  \n* Wind Ensemble \n\nI recommend Calypso as I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a lot of fun! \n\nThere\u2019s a marching band too. They\u2019re on Instagram [here](https://instagram.com/marchinglumberjacks). Message them for more info.",

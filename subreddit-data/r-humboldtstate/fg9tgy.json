And are they pretty flexible with availability? I would prefer to have Friday-Sunday off but not sure if that's realistic or not. \nThank you in advance \ud83d\ude42",

Many of the jobs in Housing, you do have to work weekends, but not all of them. There definitely is a lot of flexibility with student schedules. Although keep in mind, if you want weekends off, you also won't be able to work while you're in class, so that doesn't leave much work availability. Many jobs are hiring now! So it's a good time to check them out! Good luck!",

I mostly was just curious because once a month I want to go visit my family for the weekend and I wasn't sure if that would be a problem since a lot of the jobs I've had don't like giving time off. You're right about availability and work...I'll just have to work weekends and hope I can get time off once a month.",

Typically, you let your employer know what your class schedule is so that they know when you'll be working each semester. Some jobs continue into breaks and some end at the end of the semester. As HSU Housing mentioned, Handshake is the place to look for campus jobs.",

    "postText": "I'm currently a Genetics and Genomics student at UC Davis. Any professors here know how to become an HSU professor after getting a bachelors? Is there even a genetics program at HSU?\n\nI grew up in Humboldt and since my mom is still paying a mortgage on a house there, I figured I could help her out by renting from her while working as a genetics/genomics professor at HSU.\n\nIs this possible? If so, how do I go about achieving this goal?\n\nI'm currently a part-time student (taking between 6 and 10 units each quarter [UC Davis does quarters, not semesters]) and plan to graduate within a year or two with a Bachelors in genetics and genomics.\n\nAny advice is much appreciated!!",

The genetics professors that I know here have doctorates and are involved in heavy research through their lab. Gotta bring in that grant money. Great dream to have but you\u2019ll need a lot more schooling than that. If you get a masters with teaching certification you may be able to work as a low paid adjunct lecturer or alternatively teach in high school or something",

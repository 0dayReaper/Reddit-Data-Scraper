            "comment": "In terms of the school? There are still a ton of classes with a very good teacher/student ratio, and in several majors, you get to know almost literally everyone at least by name.  There are some really good opportunities for hands-on learning in the forestry/wildland/fishery/marine bio/oceanography majors, including having our own research vessel that undergrads get to go on as well.  The campus is gorgeous, and you can get into a decent cardio shape just from walking from class to class on the hills.  The J point system is our twist on meal plans - instead of committing to a meal plan, you get points you can spend flexibly, and if you spend them in the main slop hall, you get a pretty good discount, too.\n\nAnother nice benefit is that your student ID lets you use the Arcata, Eureka, and RTS buses for free.  You can take the RTS from campus to Moonstone Beach for a nice getaway, or just march into the redwoods right behind campus (please mind the stoners, they might spook easily).\n\nSo that's the positive - but there's always downsides.  As /u/PeachyHats pointed out, a lot of big city people wind up unhappy because there is less than no nightlife in Humboldt.  Arcata and Eureka will have a handful of bars, but beyond that, it's house parties or nothing.  Don't even think about wanting to go clubbing unless by that you mean bashing something with a club.  The economy is super isolated - it takes a solid 3-4 hours drive to get past the redwood curtain southbound, there's not much north of us until Oregon (sorry, Crescent City folks, a high security prison doesn't really count), and you gotta cross the mountains eastbound to get to anything remotely major (ie. Redding).  This means that wages are often depressed, getting into a professional/career track job is not easy, and the housing market is really locked up.  If you want to get out of the dorms and into an apartment, it will not be easy.  As in any area with a depressed economy, there is crime - mostly petty property crime like car break-ins and shoplifting, and there are homeless people, many of whom deal with mental health issues and/or the stress of being unhoused through drinking and drug use.  If that is something you absolutely cannot abide, Eureka is not the place for you.  If you are willing to look at them with any level of compassion, it still gets pretty depressing to see so many tweaked out husks on the roadside.",

Due to relatively low pay and resources, it\u2019s hard to retain qualified professionals in a variety of career fields here. Law, medical, law enforcement, education, etc. all have extremely high turn over, or are absent all together. This is especially apparent to most people in healthcare. It is not uncommon for people to drive 3 hours to Santa Rosa or Redding for a 30 minute appointment then drive 3 hours back. That\u2019s a whole day devoted to a single appointment.\n\nAlso, while real estate costs here are fairly reasonable compared to most of California, especially given the location on the coast, everything else (food, gas, clothing, insurance, internet, cell plans, etc.) cost the same (or more) as they do in bigger cities.",

Certain medical specialties are hard to find or nonexistent, and we have only one dental clinic that accepts Medicaid/Denti-Cal which is so overloaded it does not take new patients (only emergency cases).  On the other hand tho, those medical professionals who *choose* to be here are some of the kindest and most down to earth folks ever.\n\nAnd for the other COL stuff, hard yes.  Gas is definitely over the state average, insurance is around average for good drivers (mine went down a bit when I moved there, but I lived in Fresno before...), internet is monopolized and expensive, and cell plans....  Well, it depends on what you want.  You can survive on a $35/mo Virgin plan that covers you in the cities, but those plans have a service gap between about Benbow and Cloverdale on the 101, and good luck if you break down there....  if you want something that covers, you need a fairly top tier plan.",

            "comment": "Mmmm lumber jack point are probs referring to J Points which is just what we use to buy food.  It's your meal plan basically.\n\nIn terms of education, HSU is most well renowned for the Ocean and Fish related majors due to our ability to research the Humboldt Bay, and we are also known for the forestry major because once again students can study the redwood.\n\nHSU is one of the most affordable colleges in the country.  If you are looking for outdoor activities and/or a small town feel, Humboldt is for you.  We have some of the prettiest beaches in the world and thousands of miles of hiking trails.  Most people coming from LA/SF end up being unhappy because they want nightlife and that is barely a thing here.  If you don't get out of your dorm and go outside, you won't be happy.",

My roommate from the Central Valley quit after a semester because he hated the weather so much.  Us survivors learned to love the rain, and I can now start a campfire in any weather conditions.",

It certainly isn't LA or SF status, but the music scene is vibrant enough, and big acts do come through here between Portland and SF. The Arcata bars are usually packed on weekends, and there's a few cool venues. Covid really screwed everything though, of course. Other than that, there are good answers here.",

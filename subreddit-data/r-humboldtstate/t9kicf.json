Unless it's a rapid test.\n\nBoth fulgent and the health department run a \"multiplex\" meaning they run COVID, influenza A &amp; B. \n\nThe result will say \"Detected\" and the lab will be marked as Abnormal with a capital A.\n\nSorry, don't have a picture for you. Have your friend call the health center if they need info.",

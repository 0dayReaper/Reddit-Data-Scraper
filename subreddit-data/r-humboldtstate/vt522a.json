We continue to receive cancellations daily, and the cancellation deadline is coming up next week, so we expect to house many more of the students from the waitlist.  If you want to solidify your housing sooner than later, the Comfort Inn could be a good option for you. If you want to wait it out closer to the semester starting, a space possibly could open up on-campus. If you take the Comfort Inn option, and later decide it's not a right fit for you, you can always submit a Room Change Request Form in your myHousing portal. However since we are so full, likely a spot on-campus wouldn't open up for a couple months at the least. Maybe check back next week, and see how much closer we are to your waitlist number, and make your decision then. The Comfort Inn is not full yet, but it is getting closer to being full.",

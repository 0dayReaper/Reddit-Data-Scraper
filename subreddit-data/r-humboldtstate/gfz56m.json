I am considering just packing up and living out of my minivan. Does anyone have any experience with this? I have read there is a big homeless student population. Any recommendations? Tip? Tricks?\n\nThanks~~",

Get a locker at the kinesiology/pool and you can use the shower there everyday. It's like $10 for the whole year.\n2. If you plan to live out of your car it's probably worth it to get a parking pass. I don't know about long term parking, technically overnight parking at the school isnt allowed but I saw plenty of van people who did it anyways. I stayed at the dollar tree parking lot on Giuntoli lane and no one ever bothered me besides a few crazy homeless people and it's only 5 minutes from the school. \n3. If you need some time to try it out and decide it's not for you, you can always apply for emergency temporary housing and look for apartments on Craigslist. \n4. Crack your windows open a little at night or else your car will get damp as hell. This is easier in the summer when it doesn't rain but once the rainy season comes you should get a rain guard for your windows \n5. Find some other fellow van dwellers, there's a pretty solid community at HSU and it's an easy way to make friends \n\nGood luck!",

THERE WAS SO MUCH NOISE. \n\nIt was alright as long as you didn't go above 30 mph. Eventually I got a body shop to put this saran rap stuff on the window for free until I could get it fixed.\n\nThanks! It was really bad, I think it was a combo of some flu bug I caught and the mold. It affects people very differently. Thank goodness for drugs, hah. :)",

Now, while driving down the highway, roll all the windows down and put the bag over your head. Hold it there and drive to work. The sensory experience is almost identical! Also, my car had no heater, thus no defrost, so be sure to do this in the winter. The windsheild fogged up if the windows were up and the AC was off. (The heater core had been bypassed. I was working nights at the time as well.)\n\n Also, my friend is a mechanic, just not for cars. The specific thing they were doing was something they had never done, but they gave it a shot. I still don't understand how they effed that one up so bad, but that car... it had issues. \n\nI had a mechanic shop refuse to work on it again after they flushed out my radiator fluid and they allowed the liquid to go on the ground. (The fluid was the color and consistency of a chocolate snak pack, and they couldn't power flush it because they were worried about blowing the freeze plugs.) Apparently they got fined for... being dumb and dumping things on the ground, lol. That car also taught me how to top off your battery fluid by refusing to start at a gas station in the middle of the night about 80 miles away from home. I kept that car running for another six months until it finally died. RIP The Oldsmoboat. It was not a fan of Humboldt.\n\nI don't remember what I took, to be honest. The breathing treatments didn't really do anything for me. The thing that was surprisingly effective was prescription nasal spray, after the anibiotics took care of the secondary infection. Postnasal drip is killer. (For me. I have the impression that depends on your body structure.) The HSU clinic had me feeling better within a week. After having a pretty high fever, having to sleep upright, etc... I love those guys. \n\nIf you ever get a serious respiratory infection, you're not going to be able to smoke anything, hah. On the bright side, if you are a habitual smoker it's a great way to stop for good.",

This was a LOT louder than any straps I've had on my roof, but I agree that humming noise progresses from annoying to soul piercing after a certain number of miles. This noise was so bad you couldn't talk over it. \n\nIt was a good starter car, made for some really fun stories. It was a low riding boat and I took it \"offroading\" a couple times too, using angles/driving on the roadbank to clear stuff. I did learn some things, and was able to use it as a trade in. After the car died I got 3k down to my new car, which was 1k more than I paid to buy it in the first place. Winning. Literally drove that car into the ground and still made a profit. \n\nAs to sleeping upright, if you are sick enough that you can't lie down without coughing eventually it won't matter. Also, the couch was like leaning back into a cloud. It molded around your body because it had so little structure left in the cushions. (Like when Fester in the Adams family lays into the bed and it swallows him.) I also found if you sleep upright for long enough it's tough to transition back to laying flat. \n\nI can now sleep upright pretty easily if I have two walls to lean against. (Such as the arm and the back of a couch.)",

However, deposits can be an ass. Living in a car is doable. But do more research. There\u2019s currently a tiny house community in arcata you might want to look into. Monthly rent is cheap, 420 friendly. It\u2019s a bit more work because there\u2019s daily jobs to keep the community going but I honestly think it\u2019s better than a van. \n\nAlso Parking tip. First semester usually is super empty for parking spaces. It\u2019s not too bad to find a place. However second semester is when EVERYONE brings back their car and parking becomes hell.",

You might jump into mini van living and hate it and then be stuck in a dorm where you'll be seriously overpaying, especially if you get a meal plan. \n\nHow much is too much?  Because if you get a roommate, housing off-campus is about $500-$600 per month.  If that isn't too much, then I would suggest looking at Craigslist for roommates. If you still need money to cover that, you should look into jobs on campus. They're plentiful, and the faster you apply, the more likely you are to be accepted. If all else fails, know that the J is perpetually hiring haha.\n\nIf  you decide to do it and still want some more tips and tricks, r/urbancarliving is another sub you can check out.

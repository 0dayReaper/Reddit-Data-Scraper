Does anyone have pictures of it? Or if not, can you describe what's there?",

They are probably going to over the summer but it\u2019s not guaranteed and if it breaks again you should know what happened last time.",

There is only one kitchen for the whole building, so it's not very conducive for cooking very often. We will have cookware that can be checked out at the Information Desk for Fall 2022. Since the Hill requires an All Access Meal Plan, it might be better for you to plan to cook more when you're living in an area that has a kitchen in the living space. If you have further questions, feel free to email [housing@humboldt.edu](mailto:housing@humboldt.edu)",

During my 3 years in the Canyon, I was not aware of anyone ever using the kitchen. The other apartment-style residence halls are better suited to cooking.",

I\u2019ve let freshmen cook in my dorm before and I\u2019m not the only upperclassman who\u2019s done it. And the following year try and get into college creek if you want to cook.",

    "postText": "I got the email today saying I'm 016 on the \"Wait List - Transfer Female\" yet I am not a transfer (I've been going to HSU since freshman year). 2 of my friends have also been put on transfer waitlists despite not being transfers. Is this a mistake? Should we contact housing?\n\nSidenote from not allowing roommate groups of &gt;2 people (when previously it was fine??) to the lack of communication regarding housing this semester I'm extremely frustrated with how HSU has been handling housing lately and it was already not very good to begin with. It's going to be my senior year and I feel like they're just fucking with us at this point, ugh.",

We think anyone who didn't live on campus last semester is considered transfers for some reason. \n\nI completely agree, we have emailed and called them countless times and housing has been no help whatsoever. The lack of communication is so frustrating, now we are scrambling to find something off campus because they fucked us over. Hope it works out for you :(",

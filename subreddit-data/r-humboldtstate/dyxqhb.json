    "postText": "Hello , I am transferring from JC for fall 2020. I just wanted to hear from everyone on the business program. I\u2019m a finance major , my main concern is finding a job in finance post college. I\u2019ve been bartending and waiting tables for 7 years and I\u2019m back in school to get out! Curious to how many people who graduate from Humboldt state get a job in their field. Also , I love hiking and the northern coast so that\u2019s a plus. Thanks.",

Im unsure for engineering, but for accounting the majority of CPAs and accountants out there are pretty old with retirement on the horizon so jobs will be abundant. Most of my accounting friends have found jobs, some areas are more competitive than others and you with have to put effort in but there will always be a need for accountants as we do necessary work that others don\u2019t know how to do or are to lazy to do correctly.",

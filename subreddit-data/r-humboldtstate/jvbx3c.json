            "comment": "Three weeks? Three weeks, you say. I am done. I have champagne on ice and cigars ready to light. I haven\u2019t been this ready to throw in the towel since I stopped by my apartment to pick a scantron on for a biology exam and found my boyfriend in bed with another man. I will leave it to your imagination how I did on the exam.\n\nI\u2019ve never been a day drinker, but those bottles of wine have come in handy. Settling the nerves and numbing the rage after a department meeting. Announcements that budget reductions need to be made mean fewer sections next year, translating into colleagues not having jobs. The brave faces that they compose while on Zoom\u2013 all in the face of the possibility of not being here in the Fall. Alternatively, the Spring if enrollment drops and classes are not full. \n\nEmail, after email, after email. Students are expressing their frustrations and sharing their challenges. How the hell are they holding it together? From families struggling financially to friends overdosing, bosses who make the anus of hell look like a tropical resort and the most challenging educational experience of their lives. Why haven\u2019t they called it quits? Determination, resilience, pure grit or are they just badasses? \n\nMy Canvas to-do list induces tears. A backlog of grading discussion forums where the first post of the week brings hope that learning and hoping only to be dashed by responses to classmates that are the equivalent of nods, grunts, and duplicated cut and pastes week, after week. I handle three more but just barely. To be back in the classroom again, to see their faces. Hear their voices. Watch them dose off and soundly sleep through lectures. I complained and was frustrated, what I would give to have it all back.\n\nWe can do it. The curve will be a thing of beauty. It must be. We didn\u2019t sign up for this. It sucks. So why should I make it more miserable? I admit it. I am a prick when it comes to grading. I would burn myself in effigy if I were my student. I must break with old ways and embrace new \u2013 oh how I detest change. My students are dealing with unimaginable in a virtual world. I take change in my arms, hold to my chest, and bonding with it. Ah, the essay was supposed to four pages, and they only gave me two, but they demonstrated they had learned something. They deserve a break.\n\nThe break is so close yet out of reach. I will climb into my bed, bury myself in the blankets with an ice-cold porter, and a box of Oreos. A glorious week away from this nightmare. I\u2019ll binge cartoons from the \u201980s to find my bliss. I will rejuvenate, come back strong and face the last two weeks with newfound confidence and a case of red wine. We will do this. We will succeed. If not, we can support each other while socially distancing.",

I found myself making mistakes that would be completely absurd in a normal setting. My home situation did not help at all, since I am surrounded by the \"its online, shouldn't it be easier?\" types. Hopefully next semester finds me fully adjusted",

    "postText": "I have a couple of questions for you all:\n\nHow safe are the rooms can I be confident stuff won't be stolen from the dorm rooms on campus?\n\nDo the dorm RA's check the rooms often and do they have the ability to search rooms? Just for paraphernalia reasons\n\nHow is gaming up there internet wise ? will an ethernet suffice?\n\nWhat's your experience with finding a job in the area for mj smokers with regard to drug tests? either off or on campus\n\nAnd lastly, can you have a mini-fridge in the room?   \n\n\nThank you for any time and help",

They are also allowed to look over your room if they ever knock on your door to talk to you. Just have all of your suspicious objects put away and you\u2019ll be fine. \n\n3.The school internet is pretty good, never had an issue with any online games and i just used the wifi. No sure if they have an ethernet connection tbh. \n\n4.No drug tests, it\u2019s humboldt. \n\n5.mini fridge is fine, you\u2019ll need to unplug it during breaks and they will unplug it for you during a break if you don\u2019t when they come in to clean.",

The RAs will let you know what weeks they\u2019ll be doing checks other than that they won\u2019t unless they get complaints. They do quiet hour rounds but they\u2019re chill about it. You won\u2019t be allowed to have a mini fridge, unless it\u2019s hidden, if not then they\u2019ll write you up and charge you.  \n\nAs for gaming I think it depends on the dorm. I\u2019m not sure if each has Ethernet but the college creek ones do. \n\nGoldfish are fine but no bigger than a ten gallon.",

Other dorms have a perfect 100 up/down conection with ethernet avalible. Ping is good too as the campus is all fiber up to the dorm buildings, which are ethernet.\n\nFor finding a job as long as you don't smell like weed you will have not have issues.",

The Hill is tied for my favorite, better bathrooms and I liked my room much more. Now I am living in Campus Apartments and it is awesome. In The Hill and Canyon you could do an ethernet connection which was pretty solid sometimes. If I remember right it was around 45 mbps. If you go through wifi it is much worse but still doable. My most recent reads are around 13 mbps.",

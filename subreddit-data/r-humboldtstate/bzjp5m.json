            "comment": "Some heat tips for those of you not used to the hot weather:\n\n1)  If you don't have an AC, or are choosing to not use your AC, you can setup a bunch of fans in your windows (or near your windows) that blow air from one part of your home to another.  If possible have air blowing in from a shaded area and blowing out to a sunny area.  Often times this means swapping the fan directions sometime during the day.  Try not to ever have fans pointing at each other, even from a distance.  This can create a \"cool air highway\" that passes right through your home.\n\n2)  Put a very wet rag into your freezer for a few minutes.  You don't want to let the rag freeze and get stiff, but you still want it cold.  Once you have one to the correct temperature rest it on your shoulders or back.  You can also rotate multiple rags at a time, use one while number two is in the freezer.  If you don't have a clean rag available a thin t-shirt, a pair of shorts, or even some paper towels can work instead.\n\n3)  Put a bowl of ice water behind a fan that is blowing on or near you (or your pets.)  The ice water will cool the air for the fan to spread around.  This works well for individual spaces, for example if you are sitting in a chair for a long time, or an area where a dog or cat likes to hang out, but it won't cool down a whole room effectively.\n\n#None of these tips are a substitute to keeping yourself properly hydrated and otherwise healthy.  \nDrink plenty of water, and stay safe everybody!",

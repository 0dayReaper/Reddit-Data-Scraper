I'll be here 'til 3PM, so hit me up!\n\nProof: [here's me and a dummy!](https://imgur.com/a/rO9D4)\n\nEDIT:  Okay folks, it's been fun!  Thank you for participating and the great questions!  I'm changing out of my robe and slippers and heading to my next meeting on campus.  I'd like to do this again really soon and I think it's a better option for us at HSU than \"coffee with a cop\" or some other such format.  We talked about some weighty stuff here and I hope anyone with any concerns about police conduct or accountability will feel comfortable contacting me.  I'm pretty easy to find and, if you don't feel comfortable talking to me, there are other folks on campus in positions of authority to talk to.  Be well, be safe, and good luck with your studies as the semester starts to wind-down.  Until next time... see ya!",

Our patrols of hot-spots, partnering with Res Life in the housing areas to improve security, the UPD Bike Registration Program, our campus video system, as well as our educational initiatives, all have helped to reduce the number of bike thefts that have been reported on campus (when compared to past time periods).\n\nHOWEVER, bikes are still targeted on and off campus by thieves and our campus remains a target-rich environment for bike thieves.  Your best defense is to use a quality U-lock.  Cables can be snipped with absurd ease and pose little trouble for a determined thief.  Additionally, we work with Facilities Management to improve existing bicycle parking areas and they consider bicyclists in almost everything they do.  I sit on the Parking &amp; Transportation Committee and recently reviewed plans that included bicycle security and convenience features for those who commune on bikes.  So, it's an ongoing effort!",

However, as you know many people in this region partake in sporting that involves firearms such as hunting or competition shooting. I was told during freshman housing orientation that given this reality, a firearm, with a chamber interlock device, also locked in a hard shell case, locked in a personal vehicle is technically okay, since nobody knows about it. In essence, they told us that anything in our cars that stays in our cars is not their business.\nDo you have any insight or firm legal regulations to share about this? Thank you for your time this morning sir.\"\n\nMy reply:\n\nGood morning and thank you for your question.  Pursuant to California Penal Code Section 626.9, no person shall bring onto, handle, store or keep any firearm or ammunition in any area of the university campus without the permission of the university\nChief of Police.\n\nSo in simple terms, no, you cannot store a firearm in your car on campus.  Independent of California Code or University Code of Rules &amp; Regulations, storing a firearm in a vehicle is never a good idea.  Unfortunately, cars can be targets for thieves and guns stolen from cars can find their way into our community for use in violent crime... not a good situation.  I'm sensitive to the needs of folks who participate in shooting sports though.  A better option would be to find a suitable way to store off-campus.\n",

A quick on-line search will reveal countless options.\n\nYour best bet when transporting is to keep your unloaded firearm secured in a container in your trunk (NOT in the passenger compartment).  Mind you, I'm giving you advice here and not necessarily quoting law.  If you do that, there's no need to worry about being pulled over as the weapon is not readily available.\n\nI will reiterate here though how unsafe it is to keep a gun in a vehicle.  You'd be absolutely appalled if you knew how many guns are stolen out of vehicles.  Tragically, it's a significant source for guns used in crime.  Even a locked steel box bolted into your trunk won't stop a determined thief, but it is certainly better than just throwing it in the trunk.\n\nHope this helps...",

We want to make this a warm and inviting place to live and learn and that just wouldn't be possible without good communication, transparency, and being approachable.\n\nAs far as what students can do, I'd like to make a shameless plug for an initiative I'd like to kick-off at the beginning of the next semester.  Called CAP (Chief's Advisory Panel), this will be formal group that will be student-led and provide me and UPD with student perspectives and concerns.  I'm very excited about this effort and am accepting applications now for participants.  Contact me to get an application packet... it's quick and easy and I think it will be an exciting initiative that will enhance communication and understanding.\n\nI would also encourage you to share your perspective with friends when appropriate.  One of the things UPD officers get is projected frustration from folks who have had bad experiences with the police.  We understand it, but also really hope that people see past the uniform for who we really are as people.  I know it might seem geeky to act as a cheerleader for the police and that's not exactly what I mean.  But when you have the opportunity to share your perspective in the appropriate environment, every little bit helps!\n\nThanks again!",

As I mentioned previously, we work hard to be different and create a different environment here on campus.  Those efforts are ongoing and daily and intended to break down the barriers that have been built up over time between the police and communities of color. As a member of this team, we acknowledge these things and try to do the consistent work to not only build trust, but also to create a different experience here.\n\nMore specifically...\n\nOfficers spend a lot of time walking and riding bikes.  This enables them to be more visible and more approachable.  Some of the patrols include walking through res halls, our public areas, academic areas, our cultural centers, etc.  It is our hope that those efforts will foster communication and help officers better understand student perspectives as well as helping students understand that officers are here to help.\n\nActive participation in the Campus Dialogue on Race planning and discussions.\n\nAdditionally, we participate in events on campus, such as the recent Black &amp; Blue Dialogue.  Those conversations are helpful and I hope create trust.\n\nAs mentioned previously, I'm implementing a CAP (see above) that will be a student-led initiative.  I'm hoping to get participation from our cultural centers for academic excellence and think those voices in a formal (but relaxed) setting can provide additional opportunities for communication about what matters most.\n\nData is important and we'd like to hear from students who experience situations that make them feel unsafe.  I acknowledge it can be horrible to experience something that makes you feel unsafe and reporting such incidents may very well further this already bad experience.  However, it helps us to better track things, where they're happening, who is involved, etc.\n\nLastly, UPD officers partner with a lot of off-campus activity focusing on student safety, especially the concerns expressed by students of color.  Those efforts are ongoing.\n\nThere are other efforts that are occurring, but these are just some of the things we try to do to address the issues surrounding safety, perception of safety, and well-being of students of color at HSU.",

When I motioned to him to slow down, he looked like he was ready to have an aneurysm. He seemed like a bad apple, and these stories only seem to confirm it. I will definitely be reporting any similar future interactions.",

They can be made in person, on-line, over the phone, via our website, anonymously, or even through a third party.  In fact, I just took a complaint from someone via the PoliceAbuse.com website.  It's imperative for UPD to be completely transparent and responsive in the complaint process.  In fact, I'm completely confident that if a watch-dog group came in and evaluated our practices, they would say that we're demonstrating best practices and way out ahead of most police agencies.  That's something I'm very proud of and work hard to follow-through on.",

In responds to these specific issues...\n\nYour experience with Officer Tompkins is probably typical of what most people experience as well.  He does an outstanding job, demonstrates compassion, leadership, and concern.  While the first case you mentioned was being litigated, commenting on it was completely inappropriate.  That completely understandable dynamic lead to mistrust and a perception of cover-up.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Now that the case has been resolved, it's okay to talk about.  Del was responding to a call where a subject, who was not a student, was on our campus stalking and harassing a disabled female student.  The subject was uncooperative and attempting to avoid the police.  In the course of his investigation, Officer Tompkins saw and attempted to stop this individual.  He attempted to elude and what happened next is a matter of record.  The bottom line for me is that Officer Tompkins was acting in good faith to protect a member of our campus from someone demonstrating predatory behavior.  Strategically, it was more advantageous to settle the case than to take it to trial where even a successful outcome may have resulted in 3 or maybe 4 times the expense.\n\nI cannot speak to the details of what occurred in Oakland other than to say that the matter was fully disclosed and considered in the hiring process.  I would suggest too that anyone concerned about it read the details and not just the headlines.\n\nIn summary, and speaking from the perspective of over 30 years of experience as a cop, it's almost impossible to go through a police career without angering someone, getting a compliant, or being sued.  And I don't mean that in any way to sound jaded or cynical.  I'm speaking from experience.  Busy, active, engaged, caring police officers will invariably upset people who don't want contact with the police and it's completely typical to be sued.  The only cops I've known who have avoided that are the ones who don't get involved.\n\nOfficer Tompkins is an outstanding officer and I would encourage anyone with questions to talk to him.  He's approachable, friendly, and will gladly talk to you.",

Now, the last thing I would want to do with police is be problematic, but i'm sure circumstantial evidence in the 2012 incident are available as public record, namely a recording of the 911 call, dispatch, and account of witnesses and reporting persons to corroborate the stalking/harassment. Where would we be able to find these things as members of the public to put these allegations and fear to rest?",

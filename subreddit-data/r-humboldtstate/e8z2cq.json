    "postText": "I just got a car a week ago and obviously didn't buy a parking pass because it would be a waste this late in the semester. I only drive two days a week so I didn't get ticketed until today. I'm not too mad about it, still cheaper than paying for parking, but I've heard some people are able to successfully appeal their tickets. Does anyone have any advice on what to write on the appeal?",

            "comment": "This doesn't totally answer your question but is a little advice from an old: Humboldt usually prorates their parking passes... At least they did when I was in school a couple years ago. Takes 5 minutes to call and ask, and they would be more likely to forgive your ticket if you have a pass. Also there's lots of timed meters on 14th and on Union that are great for a couple hours of parking. Lastly if timing is right, you could have just bought a ticket at one of the stations in the lots... I got a massive ticket as a freshman in the j parking lot and that was enough of a lesson to realize there are a lot of easy and logical options to avoid them or get out of them.",

You used to have to go to the upd window in the sbs an ask for a parking ticket appeal, and usually even writing \"I totally spaced it!\" Would work for the first ticket... Don't know if the process is still the same!\n\nEdit: times have changed, appeal [here](http://www.pmbonline.org/)",

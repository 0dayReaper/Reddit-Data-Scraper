That seems pretty unfair to me. It's not like our campus even tries to negotiate with arcata or Eureka transit to get us more frequent bus trsnsport to ameliorate the parking issue. They just take our money and put it in their pockets. We get very little out of our +$150/semester not to mention tuition and student fees.",

HSU students already ride the busses for \"free\".\n\nI agree that college has a lot of bs fees and is too expensive, but the price of a parking ticket is one fee I don't see anything wrong with. Driving is a privilege. Why don't your just walk to campus like everyone else?",

And as I mentioned earlier, HSU does not negotiate for more frequent or better busing. They come once an hour, often leaving early or arriving late, sometimes out of order and skipping stops entirely. It's a nightmare trying to take the bus, as I have in previous semesters. The fact is, we have a serious problem at this school of not advocating enough for students well being. We have an issue with housing AND transportation and there isn't anything wrong with calling it out. Idk why you're so into licking Rosbachers old boots so much.",

Lets assume you miss 5 few days of class overall and cant find parking on campus once a week, guess what thats $49 off parking for the semester, $114.\n\nOr park at the Arcata community center parking lot for free and take the bus. There is always a surplus of parking there. It's a 13 min bus ride.\n\nOr park on the street near any of the Arcata bus stops that are the stop before it drops off at HSU, those are:  \n18 and G (lots of free street parking)  \nFoster and Alliance (lots of free street parking)  \n16 and G (not a lot of parking, but can park in the back of Wildberries and nobody will notice)  \nCamp Curtis (some free parking in the surrounding area)",

I still think it's not unreasonable to pressure the campus to do better in terms of transport because there is room for improvement. I'm not the only person who has had this challenge. There are a number of reasons it's difficult if not impossible for me to park in the meter or timed spots because of a long back to back schedule. Also I have mobility issues that aren't bad enough for the state to justify giving me disabled parking but enough to make it painful and slow for me to walk distances greater than a quarter mile. I've been also reluctant to use the SDRC transport van because they're notoriously inconsistent and unreliable. But you're the first person with a useful suggestion rather than just an attack that I am not thinking clearly if I buy a permit.",

The bus lot has a fair amount of car break-ins (my dad used to be a bus driver for Arcata Transit and his window got smashed 4 times in 2 years) the community center has a largely student populated apartment complex, a big park / playground, active sports fields, and Health Sport gym. Lots of people walking around and open visibility as well as security cams. Very safe place to leave your car for the day, even overnight, I have had a few friends who lived in their car down there when they were between houses.  \n\n\nThe bus lot is also a longer route than the community center.",

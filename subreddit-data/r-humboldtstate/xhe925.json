    "postText": "We're having our first rain of the season. After a long dry period such as this summer, oil and other greasy materials have built up on the roads and are released during a good rain. \n\nIt's more dangerous to drive in the rain than usual and we see an uptick of car accidents, especially on Highway 101. It's also not unusual for there to be spotty power outages around the county that last a few hours when drivers hit power poles. There's a new season of FortNite out today and we wouldn't want to deprive gamers of any hours of entertainment. Please, drive carefully.  -Dad",

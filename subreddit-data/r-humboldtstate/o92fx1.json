The guy who taught Asian Philosophy was very unique, too.",

There was at least one hunter in the class, who's bow was so powerful I couldn't even draw it.  He was hitting bullseyes corner-to-corner in the fieldhouse with that thing.  I just found it to be very relaxing.",

Not for you if you're easily embarrassed, since you'll be doing footwork drills shouting \"tee-TAH, tee-TAH!\" around the gym as people walk by on their way to class, but quite fun nonetheless. \n\nThe \"Stretch &amp; Relaxation\" class is basically Yoga for Dummies and was a lifesaver for me my last semester when all my other classes were stressful upper div stuff.\n\nFor your \"critical thinking\" GE requirement I highly recommend PHIL 100 - Logic. Such an easy, fun, and insightful class. You'll learn a lot without getting stressed out or bogged down with assignments, which is an ideal class to me. Take it with Chandler if you can; he was excellent.",

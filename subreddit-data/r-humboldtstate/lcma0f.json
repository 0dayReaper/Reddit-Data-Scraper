    "postText": "Transferring to HSU for fall 2021! Assuming we're back on campus then....what's the yoga community like up there? Within the student body of course, not looking for a studio. Just some fellow peeps interested/enthusiastic about yoga. Anyone interested? I'm certified to teach. I'd be open to starting a free community up here, if there was an interest! The studio where I did my training was free/donation based, so I've got that sorta kind philosophy  in mind. Open to all! It would be free.",

Not my thing, I just wanted to throw that out there.",

    "postText": "Hello,\nI'm currently planning on attending CP Humboldt in the fall for graduate school, however I'm also interested in getting into aviation (specifically working towards a pilots license and even potentially a commercial license). \nDuring the campus tour they mentioned a flight simulator in the library which would be an awesome assist in learning and logging hours, but I was wondering about other resources in this endeavor. Are there accredited CFIs in the area? Does the airport have any support for aspiring pilots? Does the university have any other resources?\n\nPlease let me know if anyone knows anything and/or would be interested in pushing for more investment into such resources (especially given significant shortages in pilots overall).\n- PS: this would also be a great resource for people to get involved in energy, meteorology, aerial firefighting, etc. So would be a great resource for the university to invest in",

I think they plan on adding the credits so that you may actually use the in game flight hours as real ones. the flight sim sometimes works and other times is down for days ata  time. \nPiloting and aviation is not big at this school at all\u2026 yet! i really would love to see an increase in importance surrounding the area of expertise but I cannot say that I see a promising future. but one can hope :) \nas for surrounding CFI\u2019s, im pretty sure you could theoretically log in hours at the airport but classes are really expensive and hard to come by- from what i\u2019ve heard. I have not done any direct research so i cannot say for certain-take it with a grain of salt! \nTL;DR- \nI\u2019m really excited to meet someone with similar interests! I wish you the best of luck. unfortunately, I do not think CPH is the best place to get aviation training- although the flight sim is pretty cool! you\u2019re right on the shortage of pilots tho! real promising job outlook, the easiest way to become a commercial pilot is to go through the military(air force specific) and have them train you and maybe even PAY for your classes(pilot school is VERYYYYY expensive). But ofc that means dedicating some of ur life to the military and you may not mess with that! i didn\u2019t really see that as an option for myself so i decided to pursue other interests, \nBest of luck to you!!!",

It may help you learn some basic concepts, but it isn't something to log hours in.\n\nThe future of general aviation and flight training in Humboldt County has been shaken for a long time. In any case, this is a particulcarly expensive region to do flight training in. The resources are limited, the fuel is expensive etc. I wouldn't come here if your only goal is flight training. If you are here for other stuff, it is possible to get a start in flying, but it's not as easy as it might be elsewhere.\n\nAlso, it rains half the year and the airports that you would likely do training out of will frequently be fogged in and prevent you from flying.",

Give them a call and ask about lessons for your level.\n\nMurray Field is a county-owned public airport, located adjacent to Humboldt Bay within Eureka, California in Humboldt County.

Depending on what dorm you\u2019re in, you may or may not have springs below. I have a picture if you\u2019re curious with what I mean.",

I didn't give my mattress a second thought when I lived in the residence halls. \n\nIf you arrive and think you need one, drive to Eureka before your parents leave (or you return your U-Haul) and buy a topper at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond at the Bayshore Mall. Install the BBB app because the store is overpriced and people pretty much always use a 20% off coupon and such.",

The dorm beds have \u201ctwo\u201d sides which is \u201csoft\u201d and \u201cfirm\u201d. Kinda can\u2019t tell the difference sometimes depending how old it is but overall mattress pad is brought by people who knows their prefer firmness of the bed. Honestly I like the firmness of the bed but some want it softer",

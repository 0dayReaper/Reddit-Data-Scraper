And ifthere is a resource I can subscribe to for all of the free food events on campus\u2026 it seems like hearing about them is very hit or miss for me. Can anyone help?",

I recommend reaching out to OhSnap! and asking if they offer a pass or meal swipe specifically for that event. \n\nFor free food info, subscribe OhSnap!\u2019s Instagram page and turn on notifications to get live story updates. They\u2019ll often post about free food available, especially if there are leftovers available. \n\nYou should keep an eye out for event flyers around campus, plus subscribe to club/org IG pages\u2014 the flyer usually says if they\u2019ll have food at the event.",

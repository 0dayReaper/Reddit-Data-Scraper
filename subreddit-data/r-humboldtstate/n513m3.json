The J and the Depot are the best deals for meal plan, but the apartments are far enough away that you\u2019ll rarely go there unless you work there. There\u2019s other things to eat at the J, if you don\u2019t like what\u2019s on the line, like burgers, fries, sandwiches, and salads. If you\u2019re going to have in person classes it might be worth it to have a meal plan, or if you live close to the J and the Depot, but otherwise no. It was a struggle to use up my meal plan even without much grocery shopping, and I don\u2019t plan on having one next year. The food\u2019s not \u201cbad\u201d so much as it\u2019s public school cafeteria level, FYI. A lot of it is bland, or overcooked to maintain heat levels.",

            "comment": "I had the meal plan a year ago before covid while I lived at college creek. I usually ate from the salad bar at the J and would sometimes get things off the hot line. A lot of the food was mediocre never really on point but some decent dishes. I did judge them pretty hard tho bc I cook a lot. The meal plan did come in handy for quick meals at the marketplace like pizza or sandwiches. If you think you can balance school work and cooking/meal prep then I suggest not getting one or get the mini, that way you can still apply for EBT.",

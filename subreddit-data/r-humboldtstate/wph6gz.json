    "postText": "I live in a 4-person suite in the dorms and I was expecting to have a roommate but she texted me the day of move in and let me know that she won\u2019t be attending until Spring semester. My question is will the school fill the empty bunk with another roommate or will her bunk be saved for her for when she comes in the Spring? I thought there was an overflow of housing and waitlist for housing so I figured they would fill the bunk but I also didn\u2019t know if her spot was reserved since she was admitted. (I\u2019m a freshman if that makes a difference)",

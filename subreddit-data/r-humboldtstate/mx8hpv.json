Students have the option to work remotely though, and I believe HSU requires a remote option to be offered.   \nOne of my professor said that classes will be face-to-face as long as the professor of said class is comfortable with doing so. This may just be for my major though.",

But I heard the goal is to have most classes be at least hybrid even if they\u2019re just scheduled rn as online only.",

Assuming so that people quarantine for 2 weeks before class.\nWhen you register, you should have been able to see if your classes will be in person or online. \nIt\u2019s not mandatory to be in person though, just up to those who do want to do in person",

Masks will likely be required or at least recommended.\n\nThe school just sent out an email saying this is the CSU policy.\n\n\nEdit: Apparently this may be limited, and doesn't apply to several programs. Lots of the STEM courses will have in person and hybrid, it sounds like some programs will still be online",

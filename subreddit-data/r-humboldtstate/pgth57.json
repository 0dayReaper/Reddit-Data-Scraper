I took both but the CSU application asked what day and I don\u2019t have my collegeboard information to find that out so I skipped it. Will this delay or impact my acceptance?",

Your grades in your prerequisite transfer classes are a better determiner of your eligibility. I took neither test and had no issues with my applications to multiple schools.\n\nAlso, everyone, including high school applicants, gets a pass because of covid interruptions to standardized testing. CSUs and UCs suspended all those requirements for Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 applicants according to [this article](https://edsource.org/2020/california-state-university-suspends-sat-act-testing-for-2021-22-admissions-joining-uc/629354) from last year.",

                    "comment": "This might be a fine line to draw for you, but the article misidentifies the layoffs as affecting HSU employees. HSU auxiliaries are [nonprofit organizations](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?keyword_list=humboldt+state&amp;bay=search.results) that work closely with HSU.  The administrator interviewed is a state employee and his department oversees some [assistive services](https://businessservices.humboldt.edu/) for the nonprofits.\n\nThe distinction surely matters to those employees because they're not part of the state's job classification system (which sets salary standards), benefits system, or retirement system, nor could they be.\n\nFor example, the [University Center](https://uc.humboldt.edu/), is a 501(c)3 nonprofit that manages CenterArts, Center Activities, Dining Services, the Humboldt Bay Aquatic Center, Student Recreation Center and the Recreation &amp; Wellness Center. I'm guessing, but I think it's a decent guess, that the university isn't allowed to operate what might be considered commercial services.",

Sponsored programs facilitates student research projects, something which STEM majors (myself included) depend on for funded work or employment. I have worked two summers for SPF, which have been invaluable to my education. Cuts to that would be undermining the quality of education , research and work experience we need to be successful, productive community members post-graduation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is disheartening to hear that people are losing jobs when administrators are likely going to see pay raises next year (and the next year, and the next year). I realize that they are employed by separate entities and that this administrator didn't chose their salary.  But does he deserve to be paid more than triple what a full time, phd holding professor makes? (IMHO: not by a long shot).",

Which is to say, I know almost nothing about him and his job.\n\nGoogling him, he has a masters, and extensive experience in finance, progressively moving from the private sector to public education. My two best professors were the best because they came to teaching in retirement after 30-ish years working in their field. I have fond memories of the stories they would tell about real-world experiences, not musings from their time in college.\n\nI can think of one or two professors from my time at HSU, who surely earned a PhD, that I didn't think should be teaching. Degrees are not a guarantee of the caliber of work you'll get from a person.",

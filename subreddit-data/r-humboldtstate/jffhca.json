They put in a data request without going through the clubs office so there was a misunderstanding which is why so many people got notified. Student life has updated their policies so that data requests must now go through their office to keep issues like this happening in the future. \n\nIt's not clear if the honor society will continue as a registered student organization. Honor societies normally have annual fees but imo it's still a bit steep. Honor Societies are allowed to register as an organization through the Student Life office.",

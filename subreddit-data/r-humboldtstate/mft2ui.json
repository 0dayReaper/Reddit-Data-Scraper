    "postText": "Good morning future friends!\n\nI am a late 20's returning college student starting Fall 2021 in the Wildlife program.\n\nMy plan is to live on campus my first year so I have a chance to get to know the area, people, and focus on my studies.\n\nThe options: Campus apartments and College Creek apartments. I am shooting for Campus apartments because the privacy looks nice, but I have selected preferences for both.\n\nDoes anybody have experience living in either? If you know the Campus apartments well, is it better to be on the top or bottom floor? Lastly, do you have any recommendations for where in the building is ideal for quiet and privacy? A corner/outside wall?\n\nThank you for your input!",

But if I am locked in for a year I would rather be comfortable. \n\nI will look further into College Creek! Can I be the 28 year old non-mom? \ud83d\ude29",

HSU has a lot of transfers, more than a few of my friends were older and it was never anything any of us thought twice about. Neither the campus apartments or college creek have freshman so you should in the least not be dealing with 18 year olds.",

            "comment": "Okay, I have lived in both Campus Apartments and College Creek. Campus Apartments can be pretty bad. My roommate and I had no problems last year but people had rats, bugs, mold etc. The kitchen is small and the beds suck ass. Be prepared to bonk your head on both the ceiling and the bottom of the bed because your desk is right under your bed. The bathrooms are okay, I lived on the bottom floor and didn't have loud upstairs neighbors so that was fine. College Creek is definitely nicer but also a lot louder in my experience. The kitchen is larger and a lot better overall. You get two bathrooms which are decent. We had a small ant problem but we have mostly taken care of it on our own. The walls seem thinner in College Creek tho. I can hear my housemates who live on the opposite side of our shared space while I am in my room. You will be able to hear your next door neighbors sometimes but don't get your hopes up for if you live on the edge of the building. I live right next to the communal trash and recycling chutes, they have large metal doors that people don't carefully shut so when assholes take their trash out at 5 in the morning I get to hear a loud *clang clang* every time. Doesn't really matter which floor you go to tbh it will be pretty loud. It isn't horrible just noticeable. Definitely get comfortable with your housemates, you will probably have to have a talk about volume and what not. The laundry rooms for both are pretty okay. Feel free to ask about anything else I am sure I have some more input that I am forgetting.",

    "postText": "hey! i am a hs senior and was admitted for fall 2022 as an art major (BFA). humboldt is one of my top choices but i\u2019m hesitate to commit bc of how rural it seems. \n\nI am curious about the department and CP humboldt in general. I am nonbinary, a regular smoker, and am used to spending time in the city, even though i live in the mountains. \n\nAny information regarding student life, 504 accommodations, the party scene, the lgbtq community, housing, food, bookstores, driving etc. would be greatly appreciated!\n\ni also heard that humboldt county has a mold issue and was wondering if that is the case on campus as well. \n\nreally any information helps :))",

Check out Queer Humboldt and the raven project. There\u2019s also brainwash thrift which is an indigenous/queer owned thrift store that puts on events and art markets, and club triangle which does gay bar pop ups and drag shows at local bars",

Only one of those apartments had mold. It was a former standalone garage converted to a two bedroom house. Moisture seeped through the floor, leaving the carpet with a slightly damp feel and mold grew on the walls behind furniture for the 3 summer months I stayed there before moving to a better apartment.\n\nI experienced no mold living in The Canyon and Cypress on campus.\n\nMold on the exterior siding of a building is common though, and resolved with a pressure wash every spring. If you're in an apartment, your landlord does that. Exterior lighting fixtures (porch lights) will rust from the fog if you don't buy rust-proof fixtures. Yes, inexplicably, local hardware stores will happily sell you things they know will rust in one to two years.",

            "comment": "There is quite a large LGBTQ community here and many queer events and spaces to check out. While it is rural, there are pros and cons to that. I personally found it easier to focus on school and not spend as much money than when I was living in a larger city. You definitely have to enjoy nature to some degree to like living here. The art classes I have taken have been really fun and challenged me to expand on my skills. You will definitely need a car. Also, if you have any kind of medical condition that requires specialist care regularly, we don't have great health care services here. The on campus health services are great for minor issues though! I have found it pretty easy to make friends and connections here as well which is always nice.",

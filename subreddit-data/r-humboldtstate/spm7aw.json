    "postText": "I'm starting as a freshman in the fall and was hoping to find some advice on what the best dorm options are. Freshman options are the hill (freshmen only), canyon (freshmen+upperclassmen), and cypress (freshmen+upperclassmen). I'm a studio art major if that makes any difference. Any advice would be amazing!! thank you :))",

It\u2019s out of the way by like a two minute walk maybe if you\u2019re walking slow. If you can get one of the suites on the end cause you\u2019ll have a living room with a sliding glass door. It\u2019s pretty much right in the forest and the extra space in the suites is really nice for having people over or if you just want to do homework or something in a space separate from where you sleep.",

If you want more of a typical dorm hall type setting then the hill or canyon is your best bet. When you become an upperclassman avoid campus apartments at all cost, they\u2019re small and run down",

            "comment": "I'm surprised cypress is as unpopular as it is in this thread, they're pretty good dorms (minus the stairs of course.) The Hill is very crowded, and to a certain extent the Canyon dorms are too. Cypress is pretty lowkey with only 10 people to an apartment (4 double rooms, 2 single rooms) sharing 3 bathrooms and a kitchen. I've heard that housing has started cleaning common areas of cypress dorms (living room, bathrooms, kitchen) on a weekly basis which is very nice. Additionally, each apartment shares a balcony/patio with the apartment next door. It makes for a good way to get to know your neighbors or any other new people that come around. It would also give you space besides your room to do homework or art assignments in your case. \n\nAll in all, cypress isn't a typical dorm setting. It comes with a fair amount more of freedom and space than other dorms on campus. I'd definitely recommend cypress over the others. Just don't live on any floor below the fourth, the stairs are *killer*.",

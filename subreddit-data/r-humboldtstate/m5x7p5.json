    "postText": "Hey folks,   \n\n\nThis new program opened up today. It's called CPS Scholars and **you get money to do what you came to college to study.** \n\nBasically, **up to 20 students can get $500** to work alongside faculty for research, teacher prep, and other fields in the College of Professional Studies' purview. And you'll leave HSU with paid experience and extra resum\u00e9 fodder, giving you a leg up on your first post-graduate job interview. It's pretty ideal, and it's brand new. \n\n(It's also worth mentioning that this is all paid for by an anonymous mystery donor. Some kind stranger has your back.)  \n\n\n**Assistantships can include:** \n\n* Writing an IRB Application or a grant proposal\n* Creating and distributing a survey\n* Collecting data\n* Reviewing/Synthesizing/Writing a Summary of Literature related to a  specific discipline\n* Holding special out-of-class workshop related to a specific topic and/or discipline\n* Holding office hours for a specific class\n* Coordinating a project or event\n* Providing outreach for various programs\n\n...and more. \n\nReach out to CPS directly with questions and/or to apply:\n\n[https://sites.google.com/humboldt.edu/cpsscholarsprogram/home](https://sites.google.com/humboldt.edu/cpsscholarsprogram/home)",

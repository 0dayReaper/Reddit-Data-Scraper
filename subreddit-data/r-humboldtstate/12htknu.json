    "postText": "Hello fellow college students.\n\nMy name is joel I am going to uni in sacramento. I need a place to stay at in Arcata because I have a summer internship there. I'm majoring in Construction Management and the company that hired me is building a new student housing building for HSU on St. Louis Rd.\n\nMy semester is coming to a close mid-May and I will move out soon after. I figured there were some HSU students who will be leaving Arcata to go home. If you have an apartment or a room and need  some one to take over your lease for the summer or are looking to sublet your place shoot me a message if you want to know more about me. \n\nAs for the time duration, I would move in when the spring semester ends in mid May (am flexible by about a week), and move out when the new fall semester begins in late August.\n\nIf this sounds interesting to you, hmu and we can work out the details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

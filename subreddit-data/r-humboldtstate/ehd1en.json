    "postText": "So I\u2019m really interested in going to HSU but reading all the posts about all the scary stuff that happens has me a bit put off. I have yet to visit but this school seems to be a good fit for me based on my research but I have gone down some holes. I\u2019m a pretty paranoid person and seeing all these stories about substance abuse and sex trafficking and many more, make me a bit scared to attend. I know that all schools have problems like these but just please let me know your experiences",

If you're concerned about drugs then avoid people who use drugs. No one will care if you pass up an opportunity. If you go out, like anywhere else, bring a friend so you can keep an eye on eachother. HSU and humboldt arnt any worse than anywhere else",

            "comment": "If substance abuse and sex trafficking is what is what's keeping you hesitant from attending HSU, then you may as well not leave your house. Honestly, I feel more comfortable walking across campus in the dead of night by myself then I feel walking the two blocks to the 7-11 back home in the middle of the day with a cop across the street. You're going to encounter shady things no matter where you go, it's just a bit more observable up here because it's small and isolated. A good chunk of the students (and probably faculty lol) smoke pot, and the hardest I've seen in the party scene is coke. I've never seen anyone force anything on to another person either. \n\nI would definitely come up and visit a few times if you're that hesitant. I would come during preview week, which is hosted by the campus and you get to spend the night in a dorm, and then maybe another trip where you can explore on your own and create your own opinion.",

            "comment": "Born and raised in Humboldt, went to HSU for 2 years before dropping out, had many many Highschool friends go through HSU, my fiance is currently going through HSU.\n\nHumboldt all in all is really easy to stay safe in, the random acts of violence are low and are almost entirely avoided by using basic common sense (deescalate or remove yourself from situations instead of fighting or confronting people, don't approach the guy yelling at lamp posts, watch your drink at parties/bars and go with a group). The substance abuse is easy to avoid by just not using substances, and the violence that surrounds the drug world is easy to avoid by not hanging around big time dealers, or scumbags that try to rip off big time dealers. The sex trafficking concern is mostly a thing amongst young women from out of the area or out of the country that go work for strangers on remote weed farms (if you are going to trim, trim for someone you know and trust). The \"missing people\" issue is just media hype that they can stir up by misrepresenting what an \"active missing persons report\" is, most of these cases are people who want to disappear off the grid, or had no cell signal in the wilderness and end up showing back up later on and then nobody bothers to report to the police that they are no longer missing. [(one of the \"missing people\" was found when she showed up as a contestant on the show \"The Bachelor\")](https://www.northcoastjournal.com/NewsBlog/archives/2018/02/01/not-missing-in-humboldt-bachelor-contestant-bekah-martinez)\n\nOn top of all of this the area has little to no \"gang problems\", we have some mafia and cartel presence WAY up in the hills, but I have never heard of them causing any random violence (initiation killing, drive by, etc.), they are just trying to grow weed and get it out of the area as quietly as possible. The \"bad\" areas that you are likely to encounter (Broadway in Eureka, the alley behind the bars in Arcata, Behind the Mall in Eureka) are all fine during the day and easy to avoid at night, and even at night really aren't dangerous if you just stay aware of your surroundings and have a second person with you.\n\nThe campus itself is extremely safe in my experience and in the actual crime statistics, I don't worry at all about my fiance walking herself from one end of campus to the other in the dark after class. I'm more worried about the drunk drivers on her drive home than I am of someone attacking her.\n\nAll that said, if you don't use common sense or very basic \"street smarts\" you can find yourself in a bad position if you want to, but that is the same in any area. If you are looking for trouble you can easily find it.\n\nThe worst parts about Humboldt are in my opinion:\n\n* The isolation, when the roads sometimes get washed away or a landslide covers them your commute to the bay area can take an extra 5 hours, and that means any outside goods can take an extra 5 hours to get to us if they get here at all.\n* Our power grid situation with the PSPS that PGE is doing.\n* The very limited variety of things to do, you will most likely get board of all the same activities within the first year or two.\n* The substance abuse issue is very very easy to see and it is really sad knowing there is not a lot that can be done about it because the local government doesn't really have the resources to deal with it properly, nor can they agree on how to deal with it (something as simple as a clean needle program is a huge debate).\n\nAll in all the only thing that should keep you from attending HSU is the very very small amount of majors that actually get a well funded and well structured programs that are worth attending. Botany, Child Development, Environmental Resources Engineering, Environmental Science &amp; Management, Environmental Studies, Fisheries Biology, Forestry, Geology, Kinesiology, Oceanography, Rangeland Resource Science, and Wildlife are really the only programs that can compare to programs at larger schools. The art programs are really well funded but badly structured, for example if you wanted a BA in Graphic design, you can't get that. You can only get a BA in fine arts with a concentration in Graphic Design, which is not the same thing when you are applying jobs, as much as the counselors will tell you they are (friend of mine went through this program and is now at a different school doing one year to get a second degree in Graphic Design).",

            "comment": "HSU and the surrounding area are relatively safe. Humboldt County gets a bad rap. This is a hippie, free-spirit kind of area with lots of alternative thinking and living happening. Sort of a blend between 70s and 90s with a little hipster thrown in there. There are homeless and drug issues, but as long as you use some street smarts you\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe\u2019re in a beautiful area surrounded by redwood forests, mountains and ocean. It\u2019s rural here so there is less indoor activities, but plentiful outdoor activities. If a small town and lots of nature interests you, or if you\u2019re interested in Forestry or one of the other science majors focused at HSU, then I\u2019d say the university might be a good fit for you. Come take a visit and see for yourself.",

A search of this subreddit found 0 references for \"trafficking\" and 1 reference for \"sex.\" I suppose trafficking is possible anywhere, but it's not an issue that would be on my radar as a student, nor a concern of mine if my own kids choose to attend HSU.\n\nHumboldt County is known as a place cannabis is grown. When I attended HSU, there wasn't more alcohol or cannabis use than I expected for a college campus. Certainly, if you want to avoid those things, there are people to avoid them with.",

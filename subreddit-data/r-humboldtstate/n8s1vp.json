    "postText": "I've been a vegan at HSU for a while now and have contacted Dining several times about various issues, but it never seems to get better. It just gets worse. More often than not, I have to choose between cereal for dinner, eating out or just going hungry. Half the time when there is something at the J, the portions are so small I get hungry soon anyway. \n\nI don't know what do do and am looking for suggestions. What can I do to make dining see that this is a serious issue and that they are starving the students they used to brag about?",

Convert your J point meals to cash and price compare. \n\nGranted, transportation might be an issue. In Arcata, the least expensive option is Safeway. Grocery Outlet in McKinleyville and WinCo Foods in Eureka are super inexpensive, and Grocery Outlet has some organic options.\n\nI'm surprised The J isn't vegan-friendly. It was super vegetarian friendly in the early 1990s, so I figured it would have changed with the times.",

We were the Canyon, which had one kitchen for three floors of students, so it wasn't practical to make our own meals. If you run out of points, and don't have an impacted kitchen, consider buying groceries.",

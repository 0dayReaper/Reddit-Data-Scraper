Also advice, don't be afraid to talk to people, most college students are alone and want friends. Take out the headphones/ airpods and just start up a conversation. Might take a few trys but most if not all college students are friendly. Also bring an umbrella, one big and one small. Remember humboldt doesn't have a close store within a mile like target,staples,walmart are a drive. If you can afford it take out about $100 in quarters for laundry. It can get you enough laundry for the semester. If you use not special laundry detergent buy one of the big things if Tide laundry pods and it will most likely last all semester. Ask family now if they are wanting to send you gifts or anything for giftcards to safeway,target,walmart, ect. Bring a jacket that zips off so that it is less of a bother in in-person class. If you can afford it buy the Rocket notebook, learned about it second year in college and I regret ever buying tons of notebooks. Also buy a tool kit and forst aid kit, it has always been something I needed yet never have. Hope this helps!!",

Personally I don't like to carry an umbrella as sometimes it can be awkward to manage when walking on smaller crowded paths. I Personally like using a waterproof backpack cover and a good rain coat/boots to combat the rain. The backpack covers are great because they can fold up very small and you can keep it in your backpack at all times in case of any unplanned rain, so you can keep your laptop/notebooks/textbooks safe and dry.",

I love to study in common areas so it can get a bit loud. I would always make sure you have some easy to make food, stuff you can make without power for example. Think sandwiches or anything like that. Whatever your favorite hot beverage is I would bring some of it, whether it is hot cocoa, tea, or coffee, having something to warm you up in the morning can be nice.",

            "comment": "Welcome, u/MeIrick! Solid advice on this thread. We want to reiterate:\n\n**-Good shoes.** Or least, not *only* flipflops/Chucks. There's a fair bit of walking, and sometimes the weather will go from warm to cool/wet at the wrong time. Stepping in a puddle in the wrong shoes is a drag.\n\n**- Hooded rain jacket.** You could probably get by without a puffy coat if you have enough layers, but if you don't bring a waterproof jacket, you're going to eventually get wet. But most days, a waterproof jacket over a hoodie covers the bases. An umbrella works until it gets windy. Layering is a thing: you can sweat in the rain on your way up the Founders stairs, so zippered hoodies are really helpful. \n\nThat said, the weather here isn't extreme (at least by the numbers). LA/SD have famously good weather, so compared to that, yes - be ready. Cities that aren't \"rainy cities\" like Atlanta and Nashville get more precipitation, but while we don't get a ton of drenching rains, it's fogging/misting here pretty regularly. It can drop into the 30s overnight during winter, and you'll feel that coolness on your way to 8am classes. \n\nIf you're still worried, having a strategy to deal with seasonal affective disorder helps. Take advantage of sunny weather and get outside. We can vouch for exercise; even a brisk walk works wonders. Lots of students swear by vitamin d supplements to replace what the sun would deliver.\n\nNot HSU-only, but **one thing to consider** ***not*** **bringing is a car**, especially if you're living on campus. *Parking on campus will cause headaches*, especially after 8am. We're working on it, but [it's complicated](https://hsu-forms.humboldt.edu/files/portalgraphics/HSU_FINALReport.pdf). So you'll get a free bus pass (the Jack Pass) for in-town travel, there's a [Zipcar](https://parking.humboldt.edu/zipcar) program, and there's a [bikeshare](https://www.tandem-mobility.com/humboldt). Bike parking is almost always closer to your class than whatever parking spot you can find. Look at HSU's [alternative transportation options](https://parking.humboldt.edu/alternate-trans), then do the math ($300 parking fees, gas, your annual auto insurance) and see if having a car is still worth it.",

Toiletries and period supplies, basic first aid stuff, some cold medicine etc, towels and sheets. Tacks or sticky gum to hang stuff, a small dry erase board to leave messages for roommates. There is a Target and Walmart in Eureka but it may be a better deal to get everything  you can at home if you live in a city.

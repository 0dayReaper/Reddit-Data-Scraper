            "comment": "1st year dorms, 2nd year off campus.  I'm gonna approach this mostly financially for you.  Off campus, you can find a room for $500-600 a month excluded utilities which would be $50-75 a month.  2 bedroom homes can be $1200 a month, so $600 split.  Living on campus in a double room (without food plan) was equivalent to $550 a month. The gold meal plan (second best) cost equivalent $350 a month which I struggled to eat that much.  Off campus, without eating out, I've been spending $250 a month.\n\nEveryone says that living off campus is way cheaper than on campus, but it's pretty comparable tbh.  I will argue that living off campus you will not have the same level of social connection.  I have so many good memories living on campus and the chaos of yelling to people in the building across and all that.  My roommates last year became some of my best friends.  School will likely be going back to semi-normalcy fall 2021, so I'd recommend on campus at least first year to make more friends.",

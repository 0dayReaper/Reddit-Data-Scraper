I have 3 other people I will be moving with and ideally we\u2019d like a 3 bedroom apartment/condo/house but we\u2019re flexible. What apartment complexes are affordable? And what areas are easy to find houses for rent? Thank you so much for any advice!!",

            "comment": "What I did was google property management companies in the area and go to each website to a) look at their apartments and pricing and b) apply. Do some research and see what areas you're interested in and weigh the pros and cons - Eureka is cheaper, but not quite as cutesy as Arcata and a bit rougher in some places. It's also a small commute to the school. Arcata is convenient because of location and it's a sleepy hipster college town, but more expensive for those very reasons. Having three other people will be great in finding affordable housing no matter where you are, I'd think. Mck and Blue Lake are also close and good options to think about. \n\nYou can also check out craigslist or Zillow if you want to rent a house. It will give you a good idea of market as well. \n\nI think it's a little early in the game to be considering housing but it will be nice to get a head start and start figuring out your budget/wants/etc.",

            "comment": "The cheapest places to live are in either Eureka or McKinleyville. Arcata is definitely the most expensive area around, aside from maybe Ferndale (which I just don't understand.) Eureka is good because that's where Winco, Grocery Outlet, and Coscto are. Everything in Arcata is more expensive. Groceries, bars, restaurants -it's the bougie part of humboldt.\n\nIf you're more on the dedicated student end of the spectrum, there's cheap housing off of Giuntoli, and not a lot of partying over there, relative to near campus or right in Arcata. Living right near campus is spendy, and so is living within five blocks of the plaza, but that is also where people go out so it depends on your lifestyle.\n\nI don't party so I live in Humboldt Hill area. My 1br house w/garage is $1200/month, and isn't anything special. Not a total shit box, but not super nice by any means. That said, you are gonna have roommates and should be able to snag a better deal if you keep on top of it. Good luck in your search!",

If you have dogs it will be difficult to find housing a lot of the time, cats still kinda difficult but not impossible. We found our house just browsing through Craigslist and fb marketplace listings a month before we moved, it was easier for us though because we all already lived in Arcata and could actually attend viewings. If you or any of your future roommates have friends up here it might even be worth trying to have one of them actually go to viewings for you so you can make sure the places arent wacky. Make sure the people you talk online to are reputable though, housing scams are definitely a thing up here, and if it seems too good to be true it probably is. (Also if it has an absurdly high deposit or not many pictures of the property, its probably best to steer clear) If this is your first time renting a house I would even say just go for a property management company owned place since it's a surefire way to know it's not a scam. (even though they are scammers in their own way)",

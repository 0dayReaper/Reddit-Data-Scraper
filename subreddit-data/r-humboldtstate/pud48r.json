    "postText": "Hey all! I plan on (hopefully) transferring to HSU in Fall '22, but I'm not quite sure what is the best option for housing. What do you guys recommend? The Humboldt website is pretty vague/confusing to me about amenities and stuff. I was looking mostly at Cypress, but not sure about the bathroom situation.",

            "comment": "In terms of oncampus housing, you get different things everywhere. In cypress specifically there are renovated and unrenovated bathrooms. The unrenovated ones have stalls for the toilets, but the renovated ones have nice little rooms for them. It's fairly big so you'd have lots of flatmates, and fairly public so you might have people walking past your window, depending on the floor.\n\nCreekview is somewhat smaller, in my opinion somewhat nicer (there are more trees and it's less beat up). But it's more remote to the rest of campus, and if you're in the suites (vs the apartments), the kitchenettes aren't good at all.\n\nThose are the two oncampus housing options I've had experience with, hope that helps, maybe other people can pitch in with their own pros/cons?",

But all of the locals were totally against it! Crazy huh they don't want affordable houseing....does it surprise me? Nah. They are all greedy about the land that was stolen in the first place, all crying about how it will reduce the cost of what they want to charge per month for their shit hole, nonetheless they ended up getting built but still little affordable housing around here. Luckily  the city put a rent cap so landlords couldn't keep hiking the price up cause that's what was happening. Student enrollment started to decline by the thousand each semester so HSU pivoted and got huge grant money to be a polytechnic cause they never cared about the students instead of retaining them they let them leave and figured a different route to get the funds. I remember any given night in arcata you would see dozens of students sleeping in their cars. Just check out some of the documentary that came out right before covid. All this shit got swept under the rug though. Good luck unless you got money or have solid income lined up when you get here and can afford 1300$ a month for a apartment then your better off conserving money and going to school online where your at now.",

                    "comment": "&gt;they don't want affordable houseing\n\nIt's just NIMBYism, which exists everywhere in the country. If they can reduce the number of people living in a presently unoccupied piece of land bordering their neighborhood, they will.\n\nIt's not really about affordable housing or students. Both exist all over Arcata. They are much preferred to homes being purchased by growers for indoor growing. \n\nArcata actually paid PG&amp;E to adapt their billing system to charge high energy users more for their electricity so that the city could deter indoor growing. I believe that system has been deployed statewide. And so, there's more incentive for growers not to take up precious housing for plants that can be legally grown outside now.",

The mind fuck was that the student spoke as if this was a normal, common, routine activity for students and he was cautioning them.\n\nPost-legalizarion, cannabis prices have dropped making it harder for farmers. Before legalization my neighborhood was filled with indoor grows. I had two young children and no kids in the neighborhood. After legalization there are kids living on every street in my area. I am a bit sour about how my kids had to grow up.",

The preexisting communal bathroom has been remodeled to have individual doors leading to a toilet, sink and shower. So, everyone shares the bathrooms, but only one person uses a particular bathroom at a time.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m finishing up my lower division courses at my community college and I was planning to transfer to Cal Poly Humboldt in Spring of 2024 for quite some time now. I now understand there\u2019s a housing crisis on campus due to the influx of freshman accepted since it became apart of the Cal Poly schools. I know my chances of getting housing on campus are extremely low especially because I would be coming in Spring semester. I wanted some advice regarding if I should transfer in Spring 2024 or just wait till fall semester of 2024 so I could also have a chance at applying for housing. If I came in Spring I know I would have to find off campus housing, but how scarce is it? How bad is the housing crisis on campus? Are there many areas available in Arcata to rent just a single room and what are the round about prices? I really want to go to this school because the opportunities they have within my environmental science major, but i\u2019m seriously concerned with my living situation once I go there and really don\u2019t plan on attending a different university.",

            "comment": "It is definitely a part time job searching for housing up here, my best advise is to just stay vigilant and see if you can ask around from people you know live up here. Search all the rental sites, places4students, Craigslist, developers available sites. It\u2019s a tight market so you have to be there first and make connections early. I would start searching now just so you can line it up so you don\u2019t have to think about it closer to moving in. Also contact the campus housing department they can help.",

            "comment": "We don't usually have a waitlist in the spring. There are usually spaces available due to students graduating, transferring, etc.. Although incoming spring students usually don't get their room assignment until late December as their room assignment is dependent on students leaving the university at the end of the fall semester. If you do want to explore off campus housing, we have some resources on our website, including links to local property managers and rentals that are available.

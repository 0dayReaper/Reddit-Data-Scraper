You're going to get crime and homelessness in any city you live in. I'm originally from Southern California and the Bay Area and I felt safer in Arcata.",

Part of that stereotype comes from our high amount of missing persons cases BUT nobody ever reports that our rate of finding those people is disproportionately HIGHER than other places.  The other thing you hear is homelessness.  Stay away from most Eureka homeless people, but all the Arcata ones are super nice and cool.  Campus is in Arcata, you won't have an issue.",

I used to drive for uber and lyft in the area full time. \n\nThere are some bars in downtown Arcata that used to be pretty sketch, I have a buddy that used to work for Toby and Jack's, and Sidelines bars, they were shut down for illegal narcotics transactions. Supposedly the bar tenders were hooking people up with customers as well as picking out targets for the guys to drug and take back home.\n\nI can't imagine that went away because of two bars shutting down.\n\nDuring the day I never had any problems in the area. If you're going to go out drinking at night or to a show or whatever just make sure you and your girlfriend use the buddy system, whether it's with each other or friends.\n\nI'm more of a beer guy anyways and have never had any issues at the places I frequented. If you want some recommendations let me know. \n\nOther than the late night bar drinking scene, overall Arcata is pretty safe. However I'm not a woman, my Gf goes to HSU online right now but we plan on moving back for her last semester, when we lived there she would walk around downtown, and to and from her apartment and never felt unsafe.",

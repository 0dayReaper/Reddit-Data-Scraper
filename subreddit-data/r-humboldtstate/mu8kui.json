    "postText": "So I posted earlier about doing English + comm and some people mentioned doing journalism. If I wanted to double major and have more opportunities, which should I choose, English (writing emphasis) + journalism or English (writing emphasis) + communications? I'm looking into creative writing as a way to get into copywriting/advertising, and if I wanted to work for like buzzfeed or some sort of advertising or magazine agency. I like to write so English is def happening, I just want to pair it with something (especially to reach the 120 required for graduation anyways). What do you guys think? I think I can do English writing + journalism PR and have pretty good opportunities right? Moreso than a comm degree?",

I heard from someone that CRT was a \"burden\" to them during comm but im pretty sure that just means you're racist? Lol idk I don't quite understand the whole CRT thing",

Journalism has some practical hands on use and experience that will be invaluable. Although comm is working on adding in their own internships in the future. Comm is more theory based and humanities whereas journalism is more specialized. You are welcome to message me if you want. I love both departments, the staff is supportive and helpful. I\u2019m not a journalism major, but I will do my best to answer",

Maybe renting some kayaks on the bay. Hitting the farmers market. Meeting up with friends and having a bonfire. Life\u2019s super chill up here! I think most people in town have time to smell the flowers, if ya know what I mean. My advice is live on campus for a semester or two. It\u2019s the best way to meet new friends. Then move off campus and start getting to know town better. The people that make up Arcata are great.",

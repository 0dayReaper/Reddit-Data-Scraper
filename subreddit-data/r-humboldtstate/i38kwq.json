I think it will be open in the fall, just with social distancing measures in place. \n\nThey are shipping orders out though. They say this in their emails:  \n&gt; A note to our customers: Due to changes in operating hours as we work to keep our teams and customers safe, shipping of orders may be delayed. Thank you for your understanding and patronage.",

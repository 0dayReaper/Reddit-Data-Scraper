While I\u2019m not a film major, I do know about this career from growing up in Southern California with several successful friends in that industry. None of them went to film school. None. \n\nHumboldt has 73 students enrolled in that program and we\u2019re 5 hours from a major city. Very little opportunity for real world experience here on set. 880 undergrad film majors at USC by comparison and many opportunities to get small crew gigs etc while an undergrad. If he\u2019s dead set on film school I suggest he enrolls in a reputable program in a major city.",

They were able to network early on to get jobs after they graduated. \n\nThe ones who didn\u2019t go to film school actually ended up going to trade schools for things like electrician, carpentry, clothing/costumes, etc.",

There\u2019s a local film festival (in non covid times) that\u2019s held at the local theatre. I don\u2019t think any film program in So Cal can offer something like that.",

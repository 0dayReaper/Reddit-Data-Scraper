Once those plans are approved, we will be moving forward with confirming room assignments. We're sorry for the wait. We want to get those out ASAP too! We hope in the coming weeks, we will get confirmation. Email us at [housing@humboldt.edu](mailto:housing@humboldt.edu) if you have any questions.",

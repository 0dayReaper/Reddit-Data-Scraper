My friend is moving up and she had to get on a waiting list for an apartment and is in a hotel until the middle of the month until she can move in. She was looking for 6 months to find something. There\u2019s very little housing here atm. Humboldt Craigslist has only 10 rentals that accept cats, most of them completely unaffordable. The cheapest on there is 1600/mo and it\u2019s about 35-40 minutes south of the school. The housing crisis here is worse than its ever been. People remote working moved here over the last 2 years and in addition we\u2019ve taken in a lot of people displaced by the wildfires around us. Good luck",

I did have luck with strombeck properties bc they do first come first serve unlike so many other places which will take like 30+ applications and pick the one with the highest income (which usually isnt the students) also craigslist could work bc usually it's one person renting something out and not a company but be careful as always bc ya know, stranger danger.",

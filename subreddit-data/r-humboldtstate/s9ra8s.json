    "postText": "I\u2019m moving out of my current apartment the second week of February and that means breaking my 12mo lease. If someone doesn\u2019t move in after me, I\u2019ll have to continue to pay rent for it while it sits empty. \nIt\u2019s a one bedroom apartment on H st. It\u2019s the Woodridge complex managed by Strombeck. This apartment has been good to me for the past 6 months and is perfect for someone who wants to walk to HSU or the plaza. I\u2019ve also had a good experience with the management company thus far. \nSo if you\u2019re interested in it or want more info comment or message me :)\nI can\u2019t  guarantee that you\u2019ll get it, but I can help make sure you apply asap.\n\nUPDATE: If you are still interested, I would send in your applications ASAP and get on the waitlist. They\u2019ll contact you as soon as it\u2019s available.",

You get one parking permit to park in the lot, but no assigned spots. Small kitchen and bathroom, but large bedroom with lots of storage. And on-site laundry. We\u2019re moving this week, so if you\u2019re still interested I would apply soon. You do the application online. \nHere\u2019s a link for more info: https://www.strombeckprop.com/woodridge.html",

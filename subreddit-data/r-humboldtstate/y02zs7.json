            "comment": "I attended! Thought it was going to be HUGE. But felt like there was hardly anyone there. We parked at the plaza and walked. My friend got dropped off by their son. Later I talked to strangers at the bars who had Ubered to the event. All because we thought parking would be crazy. But it wasn\u2019t at all, It was weird. \n\nAs I walked into campus I saw students walking away from the event. Not towards it. At the event I Saw more people from the community than students. \n\nIt was fun. Beautiful day. Lots of food trucks. They had a mechanical \u201cbull-shark\u201d and a rock wall. \n\nGraduated 5 years ago and I got to say, these Students really missed out on a cool event. I mean, Portugal the man usually headlines music festivals, and they were there for FREE.",

As others have said food trucks were a little pricey but I got something small/cheap to hold me over till dinner. Overall cool vibe definitely could have been better if more students attended.",

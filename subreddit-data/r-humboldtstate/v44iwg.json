    "postText": "So I was conditionally accepted and was supposed to start this fall. Unfortunately I did not pass the classes I needed to pass this semester so that I could transfer. I've been looking at other majors at the school and decided that I want to change to something different so that I dont have to retake these classes. My question is am I going to have to reapply for this different major? I had already registered for some classes for fall and picked my room out for housing. I'm assuming I'm going to need to cancel everything and just start the application process over for spring. I'm not sure honestly does anyone have a clue?",

They want you as a student ($) and may be able to help you navigate it all. \nBe super nice on the phone since that may make the difference in how much they go out of their way to help you. Also, be concise with your request since they are likely understaffed.",

    "postText": "Sorry if this is a stupid question. If I go to the J and swipe my ID card, assuming I already have a meal plan (NOT all access, I live off campus) with meal swipes and flex dollars, how much food can I get? Like just one plate and a drink? That's what I got during orientation because it seemed reasonable. Can I get more? Or just one plate but with food from multiple stations? Or is it all-you-can eat like a buffet where you can keep going back and getting more plates until you are very full? Does it depend on the time of day (breakfast, lunch, or dinner)?",

I also would make frequent use of the sandwich bar and take some to my dorm in case I got hungry later. That shit(meal plan) is overpriced so I felt I had to get my money\u2019s worth.",

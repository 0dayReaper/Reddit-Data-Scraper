Do you want to know whether HSU will recognize and give you credit for having taken a credit/no credit class at a community college?\n\n [This page](https://registrar.humboldt.edu/transfer-credit) may help.  Specifically under the Transferology section it states this:\n\n&gt;Will my courses transfer to HSU?\n\n&gt;Step 1: Create an account\n\n&gt;Step 2: Add completed or planned courses\n\n&gt;Step 3: Search for matches to see how your credit applies to your planned major at HSU\n\n&gt;Step 4: Click Request Information to ask any questions you have about your results\n\nAlternately, call the *one* [admissions counselor](https://admissions.humboldt.edu/people-list/counselors) who serves your region and ask.  Don't send an e-mail because it will just delay things back-and-forth getting needed information.",

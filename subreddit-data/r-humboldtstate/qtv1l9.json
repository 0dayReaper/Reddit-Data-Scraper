    "postText": "Hello all! I\u2019m a 24F New Mexico resident looking around at potential places for graduate school. To be quite frank, I\u2019d never heard of Humboldt until I found it through the WRGP program (government program that grants out of state students in state tuition). From what google can tell me, the campus looks beautiful and there seems to be a decent amount of things to do. I did notice Humboldt has very few graduate students (only a few hundred according to google).. so I thought I\u2019d ask the student population, how is it there? My main fear is a lack of a car and not knowing anybody, I really want to make friends and establish myself if I pursue my interest in this university. Thanks to everyone in advance :)!",

I didn't have a car while I was attending, just a bike, and could get anywhere I wanted to just fine. \n\nComing from New Mexico the climate might be a bit of a shock. Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful, but if you're used to having sunshine most of the year it may affect you. I knew lots who came from Southern CA and it was a hard transition. \n\nLots of opportunities to get connected and you'd be hard pressed to find a place that has more to offer as far as outdoor activities and beauty!",

I\u2019m in the psych program rn and want to be a school psychologist and the director of the program seems pretty cool. I\u2019ve taken a class with the person who runs the academic research program and she is amazing. The other grad program heads also seem really good and have been really friendly when I\u2019ve interacted with them.",

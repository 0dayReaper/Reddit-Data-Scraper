            "comment": "Letter text:\n\nFriends and Colleagues,\nI am writing to share with you an incredible, transformative opportunity that the California State University has presented to Humboldt State University.\nIn a letter we received at the end of last week from Chancellor Timothy White, HSU is asked to undertake a self-study toward becoming designated the third polytechnic university in the CSU.\u00a0Full letter (pdf)\nAs Chancellor White indicates, this designation would build upon HSU\u2019s strengths, help us meet important needs for the North Coast and California, and make our campus increasingly attractive to students from California and beyond. Building on the collective vision emerging from our academic and strategic planning, we can reimagine the polytechnic university for the 21st century - marked by a focus on sustainability, hands-on and career-focused programs, and a broad liberal arts education. Beyond traditional polytech programs, we can infuse traditional ecological knowledge, renewable technologies, equitable and ethical practices, and more. There are many possibilities, and I believe this is a time to raise our sights.\nThis request from CSU follows limited conversations with faculty and other individuals on campus, with leaders at other polytechnic campuses, and with leadership at the CSU. We are now being asked to more fully develop this concept and create an academic and business plan.\nThis is our moment. First, let\u2019s allow ourselves to imagine, dream, and consider Humboldt as a polytechnic. What are the possibilities for this region and future students? What are the possibilities for new grants and research?\nWe are aware that this announcement is coming during Fall Break and wanted to make sure that our campus community was informed of this communication from the Chancellor\u2019s Office as soon as possible. Provost Capps will be following up when students and faculty return from Fall Break next week with more detailed information on next steps and opportunities to get involved.\nThis request from CSU comes at an opportune time, as we are currently engaged in numerous campus-wide planning processes, each of which includes broad stakeholder participation. I have asked Dr. Jenn Capps, Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, and Dr. Lisa Bond-Maupin, currently serving as Interim Deputy Chief of Staff and Special Assistant to the President, to lead the requested self-study, with goal of completing it by the end of the Spring 2021 semester. Please give us some time to set up an informational webpage on this matter. Please look for more information in the coming weeks.\nSincerely,\n\nTom Jackson, Jr.\nPresident",

I do think it plays to the strengths of HSU (wildlife, botany, NR, environ engineering, forestry, Native American studies) but I do worry that the wonderful art department might be gutted in favor of more hard science/math. I predict that the music/theatre/crgs programs will be drastically reduced as a result (likely from declining enrollment/interest)\n\nI forsee a large investment in facilities, which hopefully brings some employment to the region, and maybe some economic opportunities with new businesses setting up shop in the region to take advantage of graduates, our climate etc...\n\nIts an interesting proposition and makes me wonder if folks in the early years felt the same about the womens teaching college -&gt; junuor college -&gt; college -&gt; university transition. Maybe this is the next step before PhD's are offered?",

While the arts definitely attract some students, I think a polytechnic may capitalize on Humboldt's reputation among the engineering, natural resources, and sciences. Should be an interesting next six months or so to see what develops!",

So if you're worried about a program being cut, let them know! I know that NAS is seeing this as a fantastic opportunity to expand their classes and increase crossover into other majors. If it ends up happening, HSU would likely get a lot of money from CSU, so it's not yet clear if programs would need to be cut at all. I think it's exciting!",

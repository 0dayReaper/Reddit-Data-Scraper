I know in my major, there's some classes that are very similar with large workloads, so they schedule the classes at the same time so people don't take them all in the same semester. \n\nBut also, 11 &amp; 3 are good times of day. Neither are so early that people are going to be tired, but they're not so late that people can't enjoy the rest of their day.",

Little River has some coastal cutthroat/occasional steelhead, but can be difficult to access with private property. Beach in Samoa is pretty good for surf fishing. These are all about 20-30 minute drives from campus. There\u2019s a lot more out there if you\u2019re willing to drive further. Also the American Fisheries Society (AFS) club will occasionally do fishing days, so it might be worthwhile to check them out and see what activities they have planned this semester.",

He also liked to shore fish up at Orick, as well as spent a lot of time at random rocky spots jigging for rock cod.  Ugliest fish ever, but fricking awesome two hours out of the water and into a frying pan, dipped in a Krusties beer batter.  Sweet thing about having a fishing license is that you could legally drive on some beaches where it wasn't otherwise allowed.",

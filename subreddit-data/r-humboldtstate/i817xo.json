I was trying to get the swag bag but when I click the link to go claim the bag it sends me to the blue page we were all getting when the initial orientation link was broken. Has anyone come by this problem as well and may have emailed or called? If so what information do you get? I called but no one answers and the voice mail is full, I just sent a email as well and am waiting for a response.",

Call 826-3504 and leave a voicemail (that gets translated into an email and sent straight to the right person) with your info. Their VM filled up overnight, but it's cleared now and unless they're on with someone else, they're picking up. \n\nSorry about the confusion, and thanks u/[Sweetguy88](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sweetguy88/) for the heads up. We can't solve a ton of problems via reddit but we try our best.   \n\n\nBe safe, wear the mask, keep some distance. :)",

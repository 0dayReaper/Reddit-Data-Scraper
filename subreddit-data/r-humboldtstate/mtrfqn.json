    "postText": "Hi! I'm (f23) starting at hsu this fall as a lower division transfer. I wanted your opinion on which of my two choices would be better. I have been thinking about either elementary education, or a double major in English (creative writing) and communications!! (Please don't offer any other options as these are the only things I am currently considering whatsoever!!!!) On the one hand, I love working with kids, and I have always wanted to teach, but pay for teachers is unacceptably low and I also have autism and so the environment may get too stressful for me. On the other hand, I love the idea of having multiple options and I also would consider working in advertising or marketing or even publishing or freelance writing, but I feel like I don't know exactly what I can do with this double major option. Any advice? What is your experience with either major option?",

I'd look into a journalism minor.\n\nElementary education with a teaching credential has great prospects as long as you can handle the stress of being a teacher.\n\nYou could pursue work as a special education teacher, or even an autism specialist if you leave Humboldt and work in a bigger community.\n\nThat's not an expert opinion, just an opinion.",

I'd say try and grab an early field experience class in EED or SPED and see how you fly with it.  If that absolutely turns you off, you know where not to look anymore.\n\nJournalism is a decent major or minor, English is generally speaking decent grad school fodder, but not much of an opportunity generator on its own.  That said, an English major can take you into the secondary credential program with a single subject credential in English Language Arts for middle and high school.  If you pair that with either a multiple subject elementary credential or a special ed credential, you have the world of education on a platter.  Teacher pay is not the best in the world, but I wouldn't necessarily say \"unacceptably low\" in a lot of areas.  Sure, you can't exactly live in a mansion in San Francisco's Lombard Street, but you can definitely afford a life in Humboldt or any other non-major metro areas.",

A lot of the faculty advisors tend to have a hobby-horse in either a career track fully in academia (go get a PhD and teach university!), a career track fully in K-12 (go get a credential and teach kids!), or a career track that has a low chance of manifesting itself (well, you can start writing for the college magazine, and before you know it you'll be nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature!).  Don't dismiss what they have, but you may need to take it with a grain of salt.",

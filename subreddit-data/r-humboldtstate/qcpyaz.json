    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m so excited to be here for spring 2022. However I\u2019m really lost and overwhelmed. I\u2019ve been trying to find the right resources to figure out what classes I should take but I haven\u2019t been able to find out how to contact anyone about how to create my own education plan or find out what classes I should take. Overall I just need some help finding out how to use and navigate this website. Also I\u2019m having trouble sending in my vaccination status. Any help is appreciated !",

I don\u2019t know exactly where it is but I\u2019m sure you can find it if you look.\n\nFor your vaccination status, you need to go to the health portal in my humboldt and upload documents. You just need to take a picture of your card. \n\nI had a hard time navigating the website when I first came up here and I still occasionally have to search around to find what I\u2019m looking for. You\u2019ll get there.\n\nAlso when you transfer, there\u2019s going to be a peer mentor from your major. They will be really helpful with navigating the website and your requirements. If you know who they are, you can meet with them before you meet with your academic advisor and get more guidance.",

So I\u2019d guess at least 6 weeks before classes start. It will also say who your advisor is on the front page of your student center. I\u2019m guessing it doesn\u2019t have one for you but keep checking. You\u2019ll probably also get an email from them. \n\nAs for the vaccination status, that\u2019s strange. I just checked and I can upload documents. Is the file size of the pictures or pdf of your vac card larger than 6mb? If you\u2019re still having trouble, it\u2019s honestly not a big deal and the first week of school you can go to the health center on campus and they can enter that stuff in for you.",

Since you aren't a part of an organized sport coming in, you will be assigned an advisor that is part of the Kines faculty. I think the best thing you can do right now is to shoot an email to the department chair of the Kines program. She is ultimately responsible for all Kines majors. Here's her name and email (found by googling \"HSU Kinesiology Faculty\"):\n\nJill Anderson\n\n[jp319@humboldt.edu](mailto:jp319@humboldt.edu)\n\nI would email her saying pretty much exactly what you said in this post. The faculty at HSU are incredibly helpful and will work to make sure that you have a concrete idea of what your degree path looks like. I would suggest asking for a zoom advising meeting and you'll feel a ton better after she lets you know everything you need to do to be successful here. She'll give you documentation and set you up with HSU's degree planning software to plan out all of your semesters before hand. Don't be shy about emailing her either, the sooner this all gets sorted out the less work for everyone involved in the long term. It's her job to make you feel confident and relaxed about your time at HSU so don't be shy about asking her to do that! Let me know if you have any other questions! Good luck!",

I was a Fall transfer student this semester, and I received emails about this a good couple of months before the semester began. You'll probably get one soon. According to [this page](https://orientation.humboldt.edu/transfer), the tutorial will open up for Spring transfers on November 26.",

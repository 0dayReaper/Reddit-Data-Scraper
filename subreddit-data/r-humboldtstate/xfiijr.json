    "postText": "I'm transferring from community college to HSU in the fall of 2023 and am having a little trouble deciding what meal plan &amp; housing to go with. (For context, I have lived in a studio apartment and have been cooking on a budget for just myself for the last year.) I am hoping to be living in the College Creek Apartments. However, I am somewhat particular when it comes to the food that I eat. So my dad said I should skip the meal plan altogether and continue buying and cooking my food. I just wanted any input on meal plan experience and what plans will work for what people.\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "In my opinion the food is not great, and considering the combined cost of the meal plan and housing you probably don't want to waste it, so if you're a picky eater I'd definitely recommend just prepping meals for yourself. Or you could try getting one of the smaller meal plans your first semester to get a feel for it. If you end up enjoying the food and needing more meal swipes, you can increase your meal plan the following semester. \n\nAlso meal plans come with flex dollars. They can be used at the other food places on campus. Different meal plans come with different amounts of flex dollars so if you find yourself frequenting the other food places when you get here (The Depot, the Marketplace, Bigfoot Burgers) it might be worth it to take that into account. I changed my meal plan just so I could have maximum flex dollars.",

If you like cooking your own food, the best dorm besides those two would be creekview, as they have the best kitchen set up besides cc and ca.",

Food in the Depot is decent (bagels, burritos, sushi, chicken katsu, + a new vegetarian place with rice + veggie bowls) all of these you can buy with meal exchanges, otherwise are priced about $10-12. \n\nYou could plan on cooking your own breakfast + dinner but it\u2019s nice to be able to get a meal in between classes!\n\n*marketplace used to have a really nice fresh fruit + yogurt bar/salad bar* haven\u2019t been in this semester to check if it\u2019s back, could get breakfast or a small lunch for $5-6",

Don\u2019t nickel and dime your education. I don\u2019t regret getting the meal plan bc I can eat whenever and not worry about cleaning up as well",

Then, I decided to get a much bigger plan because I really like the food. \n\nThe food in the J (all you can eat buffet) is like basic cafeteria food. I like it, but I am not picky. But at least you get different things everyday. The depot food is delicious but expensive. A burrito could cost from $8-$13 (but they are big burritos).",

Places are still open until 8 tonight, if you arent registered just go to the closest polling place (theres one on campus in the great hall, above the marketplace) and bring your ID and know the last four numbers of your social. There is still plenty of time and the people at the polling places will help you through the process",

Thats more than doubled in 4 days, WITH universal healthcare.\n\nJust because our current administration has politicized this pandemic doesn't mean we all have to. Please take care of your direct community by not exposing others to the virus. If you are young and healthy you may not have anything to worry about, but the sick and the elderly have a very high mortality rate from this thing. Getting your candidate of choice is not worth literally endangering peoples lives. If you are sick, stay home.",

I\u2019m living off campus and don\u2019t have any classes on campus this semester/: other than the farmers market, anybody have an recommendations on how I can meet some people? I\u2019m nervous/:",

If you\u2019re vaccinated or will be, you can use a majority of campus utilities and you can simply become involved in campus resources/organizations. Other than that, I would suggest finding a casual class you\u2019d like to enjoy that is more for fun because that\u2019s been a good way for me to meet people without stress of not paying attention to class. \n\nArcata also has live music at some of the bars or even late night sit downs. A bunch of my peers used to go to the Basement on the plaza since it was only 18+.",

Art events galore.\nIn eureka there is old town, sequoia park and the zoo next to it, more art events. And the nature around here is limitless. Beaches, forests, you\u2019ll see people and can find solitude if you wish.",

There were plenty of non-Christian or on the fence people when I was there, and I never found it to be invasive or conversion-y like some other christian groups. I am a Christian though, so your mileage may vary. Also had a few LGBT friends I met there, so they're at least accepting if not totally affirming.\n\nP.S. Happy cake day!",

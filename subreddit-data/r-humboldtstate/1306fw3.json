    "postText": "I will be attending Cal Poly Humboldt next semester, and Phyx 210 is at the same time as linear algebra, a prerequisite math course to move on to higher level courses. I was told I could take Phyx 211 before 210 in order to stay on track. To those who took both, how was it? Do you think it's possible to get through 211 before taking 210? I'm taking multivariable calculus over the summer and am considering taking linear algebra as well, do you think that is a better idea? Thank you so much.",

Some of my classmates felt differently \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. 211 is pretty darn tough. Squeeze all you can out of that Calc 3 summer course bc you\u2019ll need it.",

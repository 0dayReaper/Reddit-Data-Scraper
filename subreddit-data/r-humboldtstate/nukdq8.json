    "postText": "Hey Lumberjacks! \n\nI\u2019m Hannah Getahun, a reporting fellow with the CalMatters College Journalism Network, a site focused on higher education news from across the state. Right now I am doing a story on the recent push towards designating Humboldt as a Cal Poly school. \n\nStudents, faculty, staff and alumni: What are your thoughts regarding the proposed change? I also want to know your thoughts on diversity at Humbodt State and how increased diversity (which officials say will most likely be one of the many byproducts of the transition to a Poly school) may affect your experience on campus.\n\nPM me or reply to this post if you want to contribute your thoughts!\n\nAll the best, \nHannah\nTwitter: @hannahgetahun\nEmail: journohannah@gmail.com \nPrevious story clip: https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/college-beat-higher-education/2021/03/crowded-study-spaces-college-students/",

I am ready for this change and think it is a beneficial step in growing the capabilities of HSU. Through the years my major has leaned more into the digital and yet I feel I have barely cracked open the door into digital arts. Having a school in the local area that can work with digital education is something I highly value because I cannot afford the Bay Area/Silicon Valley while disabled and still finding my way while wrapped in the redwood curtain, so to speak.\nPlease, bring more diversity! :)\nFeel free to Pm if you want any other contributions.",

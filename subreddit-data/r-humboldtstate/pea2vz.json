    "postText": "It's not necessarily a problem, more like a confusing inconvenience but I have a professor who gives out assignments via email instead of putting them on canvas. Anyone else? I'm nervous about missing essential information accidentally, even though I do use a planner. I've taken 12 online classes now and I never had a professor circumvent canvas this way. On the second day we got a survey to complete before class literally a half hour before it started (I was at work, classmates had other classes) and the professor commented on the low response rate.",

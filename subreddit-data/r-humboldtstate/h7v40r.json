It isn't getting easier to rent as the years go by and families are finding it harder to afford putting their kids in the dorms.",

It's new, it partially addresses a hole left in the community when the original nursing program was cut, and (I believe) probably costs significantly less than the previous nursing program. A cursory googling found $2.3 million in outside funding in the first three search results, and the fourth link was a $150,000 in nursing scholarships from a donor.",

The students entering the nursing program are already registered nurses with an associate degree. They are getting their BSN, bachelor of science in nursing, because it opens up jobs they are not qualified for with only an RN, or because their employer will give them a salary boost for having more education. It's called a 'bridge program' to go from RN to BSN, requiring a lot fewer units.\n\nSuch a person is unlikely to quit the program because they don't like it.\n\nThe program is likely to see success, in the form of graduated students, because the average age of the student is older. Not to insult younger adults, but with an older age often comes a more deliberate maturity or drive to do everything required in a course to the fullest, often because the financial advantages are real, tangible, to that returning student.",

I would argue that singles are being forced upon students, so students shouldn't pay the extra cost.\n\n&gt; so I\u2019ll need to live on campus. \n\nThat's a want, not a need. You can live off-campus in Arcata, within walking distance of the campus, and do your labs. That's more feasible now because most of your classes are online. \n\nThe non-pandemic scenario would be more troublesome, where you might be walking to class for an 8-9 a.m. lecture class, then sitting around an hour until your 10-11:30 a.m. lab, and then sitting around until your 2-3 p.m. lecture class. In that scenario this fall, you'd be walking to campus for a single lab class and then going home.\n\nThe residence hall is preferable though, I agree.",

So they would need to use the test that takes 2 to 3 days and basically be quarantining a cruise ship's worth of students on land somewhere. Yeah... nope.\n\nGoogling tells me that as of May 12th they're planning to do online learning and *hope* for a 'condensed' voyage in late October.\n\nWho would seriously remain enrolled in a cruise ship college program with the prospect of doing remote learning at home?

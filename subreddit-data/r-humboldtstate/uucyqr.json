I figure it won't be as big as the spring commencement, but I'm just curious if anyone knows what it is like? Is it still on the \"football\" field or somewhere else? Thanks for any info! :)",

Was rather small compared to a normal spring graduation, only lasted about an hour to two for all combined classes. It really comes down to whether you\u2019re interested in a smaller or larger walking group (fall seems to be the better option imo). And of course you\u2019d have to remain in the area for Spring.",

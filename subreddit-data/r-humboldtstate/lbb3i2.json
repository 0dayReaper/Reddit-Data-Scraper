    "postText": "I assume there are students in HSU dorms who like to hunt and/or target shoot. Where do these people keep and maintain their guns or archery gear?\n\nIn the old days, when I lived in Redwood Hall, we were allowed to keep guns and other hunting gear in our rooms without restriction. We even manufactured ammo in the dorm study rooms, Mind you, this was in the early 1960s. A few years later, some knucklehead came back from a night at The Keg and fired his rifle out his Redwood Hall window trying to shoot out a light on Sunset Hall. That put and end to guns in the dorm rooms, but the university established an armory on campus to support gun users. I\u2019m not sure how long that lasted. Those were the days. How times have changed.\n\nGo Jacks!",

But they only practice with targets in a non hunting manner I believe. \n\nNo one on campus are allowed to have guns or ammunition without permission from university chief of police. No fireworks or fake guns either.",

HSU students are majority liberal currently (idk if it was different decades ago), so idk more than 4 students who have guns.  The gun club in Samoa is certainly still active, and, if you go out to the dunes, you can hear guns firing in the distance.",

Plastic guns or fake weapons that could be construed as actual weapons, paintball guns, and pellet or BB guns, are also strictly prohibited. Permitted items that are used to threaten, intimidate, or cause harm to another person are considered weapons. HSU reserves the right to confiscate or remove any of the above items from either public or private areas of the residence halls and may result in removal from the residence halls, HSU and the CSU System.\n\n[PP 40-41 ResLife and You Handbook](https://housing.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/handbook.pdf)",

    "postText": "Basically, I have a class that takes up most of the time during the club meeting. I also have a class right before the meeting. I have to walk back and forth from the northern part of campus (my classes) and BSS (the club meeting), so that is a lot of uphill and downhill walking. So, I calculated that I probably would only be there for like 10 minutes before I would have to leave again to go back to my next class. Not to mention I would be a little late to the meeting as well.\n\nWould it be weird to show up to the meeting for only 10 minutes? Is it better to just not go?",

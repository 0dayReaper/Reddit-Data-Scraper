I initially registered for it but after reading the ratemyprofessor reviews for the two instructors for my class I dropped the SI. (I\u2019ve always had As in my college courses and As in APs in high school and the reviews made the course seem bearable esp with my instructors)\n\nAfter taking Chem 109, would you recommend the SI or should I be okay without it?",

            "comment": "nah you should be okay without it. I was an SI instructor and have taken the SI course. as someone taking the course i felt it was a waste of time, but some people really need it. \n\nwith 109 just try to understand each component of an equation as if it\u2019s a physics equation. know what each variable is and know the patterns based on the theory. it\u2019s not a difficult class to be quite honest. \n\nwho are you taking it with?",

If you ever get lost with the material, khan academy or even organic chemistry tutor on youtube will get you by. \n\nArianna Thobaben is the person in charge of SI. Usually it\u2019s another student who teaches you, it\u2019s usually just study games for an hour. I found I was much more efficient alone.",

You can always withdraw with a full refund if you find that you don't need the extra help. For many students going to a new campus, there's a slight adjustment to be made, and some additional support may be welcome\u2014just my $0.02 (not enough for tuition, I'm afraid).",

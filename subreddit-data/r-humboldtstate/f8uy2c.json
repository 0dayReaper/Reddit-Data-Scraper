When we hire student positions in Housing, like most other on-campus departments, we post on [Handshake](https://humboldt.joinhandshake.com/login). You an find off-campus jobs on there too. Good luck with your search!",

Easy job for students and they work around your school schedule. Decent amount of downtime to get school work done, as well. Also, best bosses I\u2019ve ever had.(EDIT: minimum wage for this job, that is).",

However, if you have a car and/or dont mind working less desirable entry level jobs (i.e. fast food, retail, etc.) Then finding a job shouldn't be that difficult.",

My brother is a high-school drop-out with zero work experience that could never get a job in our hometown elsewhere in California, after years of looking.  He had 2 job offers in retail within 2 weeks in Humboldt.  It is very easy to get that sort of work.  If you show up and aren't tweaking, you're fine.  \n\nNow professional work, that is a whole 'nother beast.  You basically either get lucky that someone is retiring right around the time you're looking, someone randomly dies, or you have to self-employ.  A lot of times professional fields may literally have positions you can count on one or two hands in the whole county, and competition for those is *extremely* fierce.\n\nOverall, I would plan on not finding work in your professional field in Humboldt.  What most people seem to end up doing that want to stay is having to leave and just keep watching jobs in their field here like a hawk.  It often takes a few years before the opportunity arises to come back.",

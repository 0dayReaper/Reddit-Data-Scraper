    "postText": "I have an open room in my house that I\u2019m looking to fill. Currently three people: One senior student, one post grad, and I graduated in 2021. \nAbout twenty minute walk to campus or downtown. Mellow house where we all have different schedules so better for later year student but really no preference as long as you are clean and respectful. \n\n700 a month, utilities about 100-150 a month depending on use, 1000 deposit. \n6 month lease with potential to extend. \n\nThere is a post up on Facebook marketplace as well that I can send that has pictures and more information. \n\nThanks!",

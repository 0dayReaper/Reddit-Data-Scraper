If anyone has some good points about what humboldt has to offer please drop them here.",

            "comment": "I was a transfer student choosing between the two last year (but not for kinesiology). I chose Humboldt because cost of living is much less. Even if you live inland like Salinas and commute to school, rent was waaaay more than it is here. It comes at a price since you are pretty isolated up here, but there are still big stores like Target, Walmart, etc in Eureka. (But lack of doctors here is a problem. It's hard to get appointments, so if you have a chronic illness, I wouldn't live here.)\n\nAnother factor in choosing was comparing what non-major courses each school has. For example, at Humboldt I found a way to double major in another subject I am interested in. However, they don't have Japanese classes, so I couldn't continue the language from my community college. Monterey did have Japanese but they didn't have the classes that would give me my double major here.\n\nOverall, I felt that the two schools were pretty similar. Both are small schools. They are both outdoors-y and by the coast. They're both in small towns. They both have sustainability goals. I guess Monterey is a newer school... You should consider emailing/setting up a Zoom meeting with professors at each school and ask them specific questions. Good luck!",

            "comment": "If the academic factors are about equal, then it depends on how you feel about a bunch of other variables. Humboldt is a very remote, rural place with bountiful forests, wetland habitats, etc. You\u2019ll be tripping over banana slugs on your way to class. Some people love this. People go there to major in forestry, fisheries and wildlife management. If you like off-campus cultural opportunities in the arts, proximity to other academic institutions, access to more urban attractions, etc., you\u2019ll find much more in the Monterey location. Many more days of sunshine in Monterey. A greater ethnic diversity on the Monterey campus. They are both very scenic areas, so tough choice in that regard. Good luck in selecting! Whatever choice you make, enjoy.",

            "comment": "Monterey Staff is less than impressive in some areas. I went there for a semester and got very sad at how disengaged some of the professors were. The campus is hideous, food on campus is gross, the people can be the best or stuck up. I had trouble connecting to people. I was pretty much bullied into becoming vegan for my time there. (Nothing against vegans, I think it's an honorable lifestyle, but not for me). But regardless of it all living in Monterey was the happiest I had ever been. The area is beyond beautiful. They just don't offer the major I switched to. I applied to Humboldt because a professor at a community college in Monterey went there, was super nice, super knowledgable, and only had positive things to say about HSU. Monterey is a pricey place to live, but there are plenty of job opportunities. If you need a part time job, you can pretty much be guaranteed one at the Mountain Mike's in Marina. Internship opportunities are out there too. It is close enough to San Jose for even bigger opportunities. I pretty much regret leaving there with every word I type.",

It\u2019s so boring. Most people go home over the weekends. The administration is awful. Housing just wants your money and doesn\u2019t do their job. The cops are terrible and harass you. All of the cliques remind me of high school. The advisors don\u2019t help at all. Everybody is just completely miserable, and it shows. \n\nHonestly, Monterey is only good for local, commuter students that get to leave and go home the minute classes are over. The teachers are actually pretty good considering they barely get paid anything. Meanwhile, the president of the school sits on his ass all day and makes more than $400k a year.",

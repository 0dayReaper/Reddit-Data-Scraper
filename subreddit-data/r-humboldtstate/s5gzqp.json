From the linked article:\n\n&gt;Some Cal State campuses have opted for stricter enforcement. Humboldt State placed what the university called a \u201chealth and safety hold\u201d on \u200b\u200bstudents who had not complied with the vaccine mandate by Sept. 10. When classes began in mid-September, those students could not use campus facilities including classrooms, dining halls, and the gym.\n\nFrom HSU's [Campus Ready website](https://campusready.humboldt.edu/testing_vaccine#102):\n\n&gt;If you are granted a vaccination exemption, you will be given accommodations such as required weekly testing.\n\n&gt;If you failed to submit proof of vaccination or if you received an exemption and have not remained compliant with the weekly testing requirement:\n \n&gt;You will be notified by the Covid Coordinator Emily McDowell (e-mail snipped) that you have three days to rectify the issue.\n\n&gt;If the issue isn\u2019t resolved, you will be notified that you are being put on an immediate Health and Safety Risk Hold. The hold prohibits individuals from accessing any campus facilities. Faculty and supervisors will be notified of the hold. Any classes or labs missed during this period will not be made up and may affect your grades.\n\n&gt;Once you have completed the necessary steps to have the hold released, you will need to reach out to Student COVID Compliance Coordinator, Emily McDowell (e-mail snipped) to release you from the hold. \n\nI expect the vaccination rate is similar to fall 2021, perhaps a little better. So, 10% or slightly lower.",

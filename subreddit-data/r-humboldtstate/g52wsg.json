    "postText": "Hello Humboldt! \n\nIn anticipation for the PC Gaming Club's upcoming High School Esports Invitational, I've created a Humboldt State University Discord Server. Please note that while this is not an HSU endorsed project, we are looking into becoming more official soon!\n\nMeet new students, ask questions about Admissions, classes, and participate in game nights. Our next game night will be tomorrow, April 21st from 6-8 PM!\n\nAll HSU students, staff, faculty, and community members are welcomed into this safe space to interact and get to know one another! \n\nSee you there!\n\nSarah\n\n[discord.gg/7mqKVyU](https://discord.gg/7mqKVyU)",

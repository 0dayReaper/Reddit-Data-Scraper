We're planning lots more outreach and hopefully at least one AMA here.   \nUntil then, there is a pile of information here: [https://www.humboldt.edu/polytechnic](https://www.humboldt.edu/polytechnic)  \n\n\nLast year's [prospectus](https://www.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/hsupolytechnicprospectus.pdf) is also worth a look: new facilities, housing (\\~100 mentions), curricula, the role of liberal arts, and so much more.",

Polytechnic education is highly sought after by students and employers alike. So yes, more people will be interested in attending Cal Poly Humboldt. At the same time, we'll be expanding our capacity (new buildings, including housing and parking).",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m going to start at Humboldt this fall as a freshman, and I\u2019ve been using the same chromebook since middle school so I figure it\u2019s time for an update. I wanted to get some sort of hybrid tablet laptop, but some of my family and friends were saying that some schools use software that works better on macbooks or that I should see what type of laptop would work best for my school before I buy one. So I\u2019m here to ask if it really matters what laptop I bring to Humboldt. Recommendations are welcome if yes. I\u2019m entering as a forestry major if that changes anything.",

            "comment": "Second on the MacBook thing - I bought one for high school classes right before the pandemic and there were no problems but I\u2019m a sci major now and the processing core of a MacBook can only just barely handle the stress of a lot of the programs I need to run regularly without overheating itself. The fans for MacBooks (even pros) are especially shitty for a laptop. \n\nFind a high processing computer, core i7 or i9, and built in fans. It\u2019ll be bulky, but you\u2019ll never have to worry if it\u2019s capable of finishing your assignments. Plus, MacBooks are almost impossible to service yourself without breaking, and the closest Apple stores we have are sac and Redding. It\u2019ll be easier to fix if you do get a problem if you get a bulkier computer, you might even be able to fix the problem all on your own\n\nI\u2019m not a forestry major but I do think y\u2019all have to run a lot of modeling programs and probably GIS and LaTeX, MacBooks get throttled by those programs.",

It can\u2019t run the programs needed, wheezes like crazy and overheats, and every time I send or receive an excel file it gets corrupted and can\u2019t be opened or read. Apple is really trying to market the mac as good for students, especially in STEM, but they leave out the fact that most STEM applications are suited to windows.",

I'm a computer science major and I've got the 16gb ram model and it does everything I need it to do, idk what kinds of programs you'd need to run as a forestry major but they do offer  a cheaper 8gb model if you aren't doing anything that intense. It's a hybrid laptop tablet like what you're looking for, I use Krita to take notes but I feel like there probably is better software out there for notetaking",

Mac make great personal machines but do poorly in windows environments/ businesses. They are use a lot by techs and computer science majors due to their ability to side load linux and run many programs from command line easily.\n\n2. Windows laptops are a minefield of barely tested SKUs and questionable setups, especially when looking at budget options.\n\nThat being said, I really like lenovo laptops, especially their thinkpad line. I personally just moved from a Lenovo yoga (Lasted almost 10 years!) and I currently use a Dell XPS 13 as my work daily driver. Before moving to the XPS I was considering getting a Carbon X1.\n\nIf I was in your shoes I would still go for a Carbon X1 but I am biased as I am not a big fan of MacOS for my personal use.",

            "comment": "If you know what major you're choosing, contact the academic department and see if they have a computer recommendation based on any software they expect you to run. My guess is, if they do have required software, it will probably be available for both Mac and Windows.\n\nTo that end, I would buy Windows because it's dramatically less expensive. If you think you'll mainly use the Google suite of software you're been using for years on your Chromebook, consider buying an upgrade Chromebook with a touchscreen.\n\nBuy a computer that has at least a 2 year warranty. Computers purchased at Costco or Costco.com automatically have a 2 year warranty. When there is a problem, you call Costco, the rep does basic troubleshooting, then the rep quickly connects you to the manufacturer's help line, has you skip their same troubleshooting, and the rep listens in on your call to be sure you're satisfied.",

    "postText": " \n\nHey guys, I know this is kind of late but I'm in need of a roommate for a 2-bedroom apartment in Arcata. It's currently my girlfriend's place, but she's moving to Eureka in about a month, so I'm taking the apartment to be close to school.\n\nMove-in would be in early September, and it's a month-to-month lease. Rent for one of the bedrooms is $515/month. Water and trash are included, so we'd just have to cover internet and PG&amp;E between the two of us.\n\nThe apartment is 800 sq. ft. with 2 beds/1 bath and a full kitchen, and it's right next to the building's laundry room. It's a 5-minute drive from campus.\n\nI have a dog, he's very friendly and doesn't bark much.\n\nI'm a 25 year old dude majoring in zoology finishing off my last semester. \n\nWe'll each have to apply through the apartment's website and get approved, so DM me if you'd like more details.",

    "postText": "Humboldt is on the top of my list for schools. I have visited and got the feel for this school. I really like it and the area, but the forestry building is old and dingy... it's the only major I want to do. The course titles/descriptions are really limited and not very exciting. Hopefully they don't express what the classes are actually about. Everyone has only nice things to say about humboldt. It is just hard to grasp as an outside prospective student. I have been looking at other schools, but they don't have the same uniqueness this area has. I really liked the botany geodome. Please tell me the forestry program is cooler than the building. My community college building is way nicer...",

            "comment": "Hey, kiddo that building hasn\u2019t changed since I graduated in 2001! Just kidding, but it hasn\u2019t. I understand your hesitation. The upside to Humboldt is that you have labs out in the forest and not textbook based and access to local professionals (like myself) who do guest lectures and labs. Also, there are more options for completing the major including fire and restoration. The down side is Berkeley and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo have more intense classes that employers outside of Humboldt County look for over Humboldt grads. Don\u2019t fret over the condition of the building. Just look at redwood forest two blocks away and you\u2019ll appreciate the potential experience in a different way. Whatever you decide, good luck and may the forest be with you (thanks to Dr. Dale Thornberg).",

Trust me, you'll want dingy classrooms and quality labs/trips/profs over shiny buildings and professors who hardly ever step on anything but concrete and brick.  \n\n\nThe number of citations/publications =/= excellence.  While the technical knowledge found at Berkeley or SLO is high, boots on the ground and time in the woods are far more meaningful",

I would cross my fingers that all my classes would be in the nice natural resources building next door. I brought friends and they were like \"yikes\" down the serial killer hallway past the dusty logging memorabilia. I think anyone would call it rough.",

A lot of your lecture will actually be held in other building due to the size of classrooms in the Forestry building. When you're not in the lecture hall you'll have a large number or labs out in the forest doing hands on work in your backyard. If you're choosing a college by the modernization of the building this ain't the spot. I choose to attend Cal Poly Humboldt because it's surrounded by redwoods and the proximity to multiple large forests and Forestry employers. I do not regret my decision at all.",

I\u2019m not making my decisions just off of a building but I do want to know what spaces I will be in for most of my time. I like most other things it\u2019s just hard to grasp programs from an outside perspective other then what you see with your own eyes. On the swing side osu was ONLY selling its \u201cfresh new sustainable\u201d building, computer labs etc\u2026 and I wasn\u2019t buying it. It didn\u2019t have anything to say or show for its program. My community college is so cool at this point with its facilities/field studies relationship, I kind of don\u2019t know where to go next.",

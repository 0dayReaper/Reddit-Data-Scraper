No matter what I would start looking for off campus housing today because it goes incredibly quickly up here. Check for anything you think might be okay for you daily. You can also check Craigslist etc. for people looking for roommates",

Although, unfortunately, it may not be until later in the summer, depending on your waitlist number. Feel free to email housing@humboldt.edu and ask for updates on how close we are getting to your waitlist number.",

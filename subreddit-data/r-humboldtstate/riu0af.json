I turned down all my other college offers for HSU because I love the enviornment and the area. \n\nHousing is rough and so if finding a good job. But for me, it\u2019s a part of my adult life. I\u2019d have a hard time no matter where I was. But I\u2019m so happy I chose here. I love the weather and the way the fog lifts from the forest in the morning. I love the other students and the shops. At the same time I talk shit on Humboldt tho. There\u2019s a lot of cons and negatives. As open as HSU students are, it\u2019s in a close minded area. But I honestly think out of everywhere that I could have been, I\u2019m happiest here. I know a lot of my peers who hate it though, couldn\u2019t stand it for reasons I understand. My current roommate is counting down the days until she\u2019s able to leave. There\u2019s no night life unless you have a friend group who goes out to bars or the beach. I miss filipino food and malls. I miss culture. But as much as I miss that, I love it here and, for me, it\u2019s worth it.",

            "comment": "HSU has a lot of great things to offer. Im one of the many who came to school here and has never left. \n\nAs many have already stated, housing is a challenge. There are apartments complexes starting to pop up in preparation for the change to becoming a Polytechnic. If you are lucky to find housing, the prices are ridiculous for what you get. Unfortunately, landlords are often deemed slumlords here. \n\nA lot of people also don\u2019t realize how rural it truly is here. All it takes is a few landslides or wildfire season to shut down the few major roadways. I\u2019ve also heard of folks being really bored - if you\u2019re craving city life, this is not the place for you. If you appreciate being outdoors and love exploring the outdoor recreation scene, you\u2019ll find an endless supply for enjoyment. \n\nOverall, people are pretty darn friendly. There has been a steady uptick in crime, due to the drug scene, homelessness and mental health conundrum. The mellow \u201ctime standing still\u201d vibe is still around, but I\u2019ve also seen an interesting progression in the Arcata area that is, at times, unsettling. \n\nThe immediate areas surrounding the college are doing their best to keep up with a nearly nonexistent economy. For those of us that live here, it\u2019s challenging. For college students who are here to get their degree and move on, it\u2019s fine. \n\nThere aren\u2019t many resources for shopping. Locally sourced places are your best bet. There are several local grocery stores that do really well. \n\nOverall, Humboldt can be the best, or the most challenging place to be. It really depends on what your brother is interested in, and how he plans to finance his stay.",

Criminal Justice is a very niche field of study and if he doesn\u2019t plan on working in a police station or courthouse after getting his degree, then it would be wise to consider a broader major. Even if he *does* want to work in the criminal Justice system, there are other majors that would likely benefit him more like Political Science/ Pre-Law, Sociology, Psych/ Social Behavior, etc. Just my $0.02.",

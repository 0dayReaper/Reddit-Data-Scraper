Anyone know of places that allow dogs not too far from campus? I have a pit bull which makes things harder due to \u201crestrictions\u201d but she\u2019s my service animal I have to have her with me. It\u2019s getting down to the wire I really gotta move from SoCal soon so if I don\u2019t find something I\u2019ll just have to keep her on the low.",

A rental agency can't refuse your service dog if they approve your application and can't deny your application based solely on you having a service dog... Unless of course it isn't actually or legally a service dog.",

The reasons we stress \"if it's legitimate\" isn't to be mean, it's because if it's not, and you don't have all your ducks in a row (letter from your doc, etc.), this will backfire drastically on you.\n\nIf it's legitimate though, wait until after you are approved and just before lease signing and request the reasonable accommodation.",

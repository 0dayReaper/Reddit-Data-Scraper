    "postText": "Hello, hello!:)\n\nI\u2019m a high school senior and I\u2019ve recently been accepted into Cal Poly Humboldt, but I was hoping to get some opinions on if living on or off campus would be better as a freshman. \n\nI\u2019ve heard that living on-campus would probably be the best option because I would be close to everything (student store, the J, classes, etc) and would also be a lot better for my social life and making friends. \n\nAt the same time, I\u2019m pretty introverted and would appreciate having a space of my own to recharge. Also, because rent leases are year-long, I was hoping not to go home during the breaks and summer because of my home situation. \n\nFor context, my social situation would probably be weird anyway because I\u2019m graduating high school with two AA degrees and the credits would likely bump me up to sophomore or junior classes. \n\nTLDR: would you say it\u2019s better for an introverted freshman to live on or off campus?",

            "comment": "I'm a senior in my final semester at CPH and I highly recommend living on campus your freshman year. There are lots of spaces to be alone around campus that aren't your dorm/suite, including the Library, the Community Forest, dining halls, etc. These spots are great for winding down from social interaction, but I do understand wanting a private space to do so. The reality is if you do have a roommate, they most likely will not be in your dorm/suite 24/7, especially if you both have full class schedules.\n\nLiving off campus can be rough for your first year, especially if you do or don't have a car. If you do have a car, parking is notoriously a pain at CPH, both affording it and finding it on campus. If you don't have a car, you will have to account for taking public transportation (which is decent in the area) or hiking your way to campus.\n\nAll in all, I think that living on campus will not only aid in supporting your social life but also just allowing you to settle into the area &amp; the swing of higher education. You'll really appreciate it if you have any 8 AM classes too.\n\nBest of luck! :)",

You can figure out some life stuff (just like regular living away from home experiences) and in the meantime enjoy not having utility bills or having to grocery shop etc. \nAlso did you get all your credits from a hybrid type of high school? There\u2019s a local school, Academy of the Redwoods that is high school along with college credits. It seems really neat! It didn\u2019t exist when I was a kid.",

For your own personal development as a human being, I encourage you to live on campus and challenge yourself to form new friendships. If you are living in first year housing, everyone on your floor will be in the same predicament, interested in forming friendships from the get-go. Be the same from Day One, welcoming those friendships.",

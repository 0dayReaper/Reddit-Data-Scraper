There, we practice the various \"events\" that happen during competitions.\n\nThe events include things like axe throwing, tree climbing, wood chopping, and sawing. It's a great deal of fun.\n\nThis year, there's no competitions because of the coronavirus, but in a normal year, we would travel to other places, sometimes out of state, to compete with other schools.\n\nIf there's anything else you want more detail about, feel free to ask. For now, here's a short video that shows some of the stuff we do:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4Z0CZQflQXI",

I probably still am because we haven't had too many practices. But despite being bad at it, it's a great deal of fun. The older members have been nothing but supportive, so it's a super welcome environment for newer people",

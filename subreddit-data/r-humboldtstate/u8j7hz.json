The general class workload is light, every lab starts with a quiz on the previous weeks material and there\u2019s not a lot of homework. You\u2019re expected to hold yourself accountable to keeping up with the content and memorizing taxonomy. A head start on the taxonomy would be rly helpful, by first lab we were expected to have 8 phyla memorized.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a currently attending CPH and I\u2019m majoring in Zoology. It\u2019s a heavy unit major so expect to possibly graduate a year later than most of your friends with other majors. Also keep in mind that the major is lab heavy and is more for if you plan on going to Med school or doing lab research than getting hands on with animals. You do learn anatomy and taxonomy of animals but if your goal is to be in the field working hands on with wildlife and animals you should look into majoring in wildlife. This is a major I\ufe0f wish I\ufe0f would have known about before transferring as a junior. Overall the classes are challenging but the teachers that I\ufe0f have had so far are always willing to help. Lectures are only an hour and not everything you need to know is covered. Classes are heavily reliant on you reading the book or looking to outside resources to solidify your understanding. YouTube, crash course, khan academy, and openstax have been my go to resources so far. Also start looking into other academic programs the school offers these helped me further my understanding of what would be needed in my future career and it has given me great opportunities to see if my major is right for me. They can also help you navigate resources on campus. I\ufe0f also live on campus in apartments so if you have any questions about it feel free to ask. Im also an minority student which can be very hard in that area so if you need help or have questions about my experience so far let me know. If you have any other questions and need an honest answer lmk and I\ufe0f will be happy to help! Hope you have a good time at HSU!",

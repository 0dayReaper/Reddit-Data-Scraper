    "postText": "There were zero buildings open to use the bathroom near G11 at 7am today. I checked every building all the way to Nelson hall and when I got to Nelson hall the door was locked. I thought Nelson Hall was suppose to be open 24/7. Thankfully I have a portable toilet otherwise I would have either shit myself or take a squat in front of Nelson hall to show administration what\u2019s up. I wouldn\u2019t been able to hold it long enough to drive into town for a bathroom. Humorously frustrated. There should always be a bathroom open for students who are on campus in the early mornings. I\u2019ve been here five weeks so perhaps I\u2019m unaware of some things. Kindly share or urge admin to have bathrooms available in early mornings. Thanks.",

    "postText": "HSU NOTIFICATION -\n\nAll classes are cancelled on March 23-25.\n\nClasses will be taught in alternative modes starting March 26 to April 17.\n\nThe campus will remain open and all student services will be available.\n\nHumboldt State University will suspend face-to-face instruction and move to alternative modes of instruction on March 26. This will follow the regularly scheduled Spring Break and an extended three-day faculty preparation and development period (March 23-25) during which instruction is cancelled. Based on the parameters set forth by the CSU system, this suspension of face-to-face instruction is temporary and currently scheduled to remain in place through April 17.\u00a0\nThe schedule and agendas for three days (March 23-25) of mandatory faculty preparation and development is forthcoming. Lecturer faculty will receive a stipend for participation.\u00a0\nAlternative modes of instruction will include use of Canvas, Zoom, and other instructional technologies. For more information on preparing to use alternative modes of instruction please see the\u00a0Keep Teaching website.\u00a0\nStudents: Please look for email and Canvas-based communications from your instructors about plans for individual courses. Please also see the FAQ page on the HSU COVID-19 web page:\u00a0https://covid19.humboldt.edu/faqs\u00a0for general information.\u00a0\nThe decision is intended to mitigate spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), and is based on current guidelines from the CSU system, Office of the Governor, as well as local and state health officials. It was made following consultation and meetings of the academic department Chairs, Deans, Provost and Chair of the University Senate.\u00a0\nThe decision was not made lightly. The goal of these changes is to minimize the need to gather in large groups or spend prolonged time in close proximity in spaces such as classrooms.\nThe University remains open. Residence halls, dining, student support services, health, counseling, disability services and other related offices remain fully available in support of all students. Students who need computers, Wi-Fi, or other technological support can continue to use the Library and computer lab spaces on campus. A social distancing policy is likely to be in place on campus following Spring Break. More information on HSU\u2019s social distancing policy is forthcoming. All staff are expected to report to work. Student employees should return to their normal work as scheduled following Spring Break unless alternative arrangements are made with their supervisors.\nThere is currently no community spread of COVID-19 in Humboldt County. There have been no cases of COVID-19 on campus. Because information about the virus is changing rapidly, please check your\u00a0humboldt.edu\u00a0email and\u00a0HSU\u2019s COVID-19 website\u00a0frequently during the break for announcements from HSU and California State University system.\nDon\u2019t forget there are\u00a0basic steps you can take to protect yourself and help prevent the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0\n\nStay home if you are sick or have a fever.\u00a0\n\nWash your hands frequently and avoid touching your face and eyes, nose, mouth.\n\nRoutinely clean your home, particularly high touch surfaces like doorknobs.\n\nConsider limiting attendance at optional large gatherings because this is where colds, flu, and other respiratory viral infections are spread.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember to treat each other with care, respect, and empathy as the virus continues to disrupt daily life.\u00a0\nPlease know that support and health and wellbeing services are available on campus. Students who would like to talk with a counselor can contact Counseling &amp; Psychological Services in Student Health &amp; Counseling at 707.826.3236 anytime. Staff or faculty seeking additional support may call the Employee Assistance Program at 707.443.7358.",

Someone mentioned art majors having a hard time, and at first i (embarissingly) scoffed at the notion before realizing they won't have access to the potentially expensive materials/references they need, not to mention the guidance of our super talented art dept.\n\n\nPretty much all majors are screwed, except maybe philosophy majors... /s",

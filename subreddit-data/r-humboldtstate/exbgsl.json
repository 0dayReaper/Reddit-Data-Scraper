And I get it, we\u2019re college students and sometimes we don\u2019t have enough time to shower or to do laundry...\n\nBut Jesus Christ guys.\n\nIn literally all of my classes there\u2019s someone so musty, so fucking smelly, that it\u2019s literally distracting. And even walking around campus sometimes people\u2019s body odor is so strong it makes me fucking gag. Use some fucking deodorant and spray some febreze on your clothes at least. (Btw those all natural aluminum free deodorants don\u2019t work.) oh and just to be clear- don\u2019t do these things in class. Put your deodorant on before you come to class. I\u2019ve had people in my classes straight up do their whole hygiene routine at their desks. It\u2019s fucking disgusting. I\u2019ve been on a lot of college campuses and Humboldt is definitely the worst smelling one. It\u2019s a disgrace. \n\nGet it together everyone.",

Is the Humboldt weather as gloomy as people say it is with like no sun for a long time? What\u2019s there to do in Arcata? How diverse are restaurants, and supermarkets (i\u2019m from the bay area so i\u2019m very used to lots of asian/hispanic/southeast type restaurants and supermarkets)? Also a question i\u2019m a bit scared of asking, with the rising amounts of hate crimes on asian american and pacific islanders, would any other asian students be willing to express how they feel living in the area? I\u2019ve been looking at some demographics for the county and i\u2019m not going to lie i\u2019m used to a lot of diversity and from what i\u2019ve seen it looks like there is not a big asian community in the area. Any input on how the general community is like would also be appreciated.",

            "comment": "It rains quite a bit, and it is gloomy for a large part of the year, but if your coming from the bay area it might not be all that much worse than what you're use to. \n\nArcata has a good amount of out door activities, a good number of bars, and regular community events. There's also rock climbing and hatchet throwing. There are not many restaurants, you will get bored of the available places to eat in Arcata (and the surrounding area) the restaurants here are pretty good, but nothing to write home about. \n\nYou won't find supermarkets in Arcata that cater to any particular demographic (other than yuppies and hippies), but there are some in Eureka. \n\nArcata is a fiercely progressive community filled with well meaning mostly white people. In Arcata you may encounter ignorance but you probably won't see hate. Eureka is comparatively diverse, but that does include some shady rednecks, and it is not nearly as diverse as you'll be used to. I rarely hear about race based crime, but there is a lot of crime in general. There are white supremacists in the surrounding areas, and I would be a little careful in McKinleyville, but you should be okay. I don't think you'll find much of an Asian community here but I could be wrong, I'm a white dude, so my perspective on this is limitted. \n\nUnless you're planning to study Wildlife, Botany, Geology, Forestry, Anthropology etc. or are really into outdoor recreation, I wouldn't recommend coming here. HSU excels at field based education, but is kind of middling in a lot of other areas and Humboldt can be boring for people who aren't into what it offers.\n\nIf you are into outdoors, then get on over here, you'll have a blast.",

The only unique things I can say thatare different on your post is that yeah there are not a lot of asians at HSU.  Just go look at their demographics.  All colleges post their percentages of race and gender and whatnot.  There are a couple of Asian markets in Eureka though.  Also, I'm white, but I haven't really heard of any outright racism.  My four Asian friends haven't had any issues really.  You might run into more issues in Fortuna and McKinleyville though?",

Fog is becoming scarcer, it seems to be replaced with low lying clouds instead, and burns off pretty quick in the summer.\n\nNever too hot, never too cold. Summers have been getting scary dry, this year has not rained enough yet for my liking. There are endless opportunities for adventure, its big enough for major services, and small enough that people know your name if you stick around. \n\n\nFwiw: I am finishing my undergrad and starting grad school in the fall at HSU.  It's nice in all the right ways for my liking",

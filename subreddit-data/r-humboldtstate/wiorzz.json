    "postText": "So my schedule this semester got pretty complicated and I have a couple days where I have online classes right before or after in person classes. Is my best bet to try to reserve a study room in the library, or are there other places quiet enough for online classes? Any suggestions that are close to the science buildings are greatly appreciated \ud83d\udc96",

There are a few tables scattered throughout the building on the various floors. \n\nThe lobby at student business center is usually pretty quiet.  \n\nThese are the two that are close to the science buildings.  \n\nStudent activity center is also pretty decent. \n\nSometimes I'll go into the depot in the area tucked away by the vending machines.  \n\nGood headphones help tune out distractions.  \n\nGood luck",

Using the search box for 'hiking' turns up Geology and Recreation Administration as clubs that include that word in their description. There are other clubs sure to contain students who enjoy hiking and backpacking.\n\n[CenterActivities](https://centeractivities.humboldt.edu/) on campus hosts fee-based [outdoor activities](https://centeractivities.humboldt.edu/Program/GetProducts?classification=5013cc29-fecc-44e0-9672-ad832174a39a) that will also connect you with like-minded students.\n\nThe [Redwood Chapter of the Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/redwood/region) also hosts local hikes (although, it seems, not in December). The Redwood Region comprises 9 counties. I'm accustomed to seeing their excursions mentioned in the event section of the weekly North Coast Journal newspaper, which is free and can be picked up on campus and around town.",

Even a rainproof backpack cover for when you bring a laptop or tablet to school. I didn't get one until my last year and kicked myself for not getting it sooner! Umbrellas suck and I gave them up. REI sales will help you out a bunch.\n\nAlso, dread your hair and stop shaving and wearing deodorant now so you can fit in. lol jk . . . kindaa\n\nYou can also rent out a locker from the building next to the gym for $5-10 a semester. This helped me a bunch for keeping workout clothes, yoga mat, and my lunch on campus.",

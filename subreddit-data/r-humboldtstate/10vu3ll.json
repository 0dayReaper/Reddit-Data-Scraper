            "comment": "I lived in The Canyon my first year. IMHO it was the best choice for an introduction because a decent number of people live on a floor, but not a huge number like you find in The Hill. There are elevated walkways that make accessing the second floor of the Jolly Giant Complex (JGC or \"The J\") easy... and the JGC has an elevator to get up to the main campus level if you don't want to take the stairs.\n\nMy second year I moved to a single room in the same Canyon residence hall, then my third year wanted closer to an apartment experience in Cypress (also in a single) where a childhood friend was staying.\n\nApply for on-campus housing as soon as applications are accepted.\n\nThe most cohesive \"dorm community\" experience happens around the original residential hall complex (the JGC, Canyon, Cypress and The Hill). Other residence halls were build later and are scattered around campus. The JGC houses the cafeteria.",

I'd recommend the well living dorms for the genuine weirdos, not the party folks. if that's your scene, idk if Stoney Madrone is still a thing. The hill feels like a prison, I'd far prefer canyon. tips: Get a single and shell out for the largest food package.",

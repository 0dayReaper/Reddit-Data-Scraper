Obviously that wasn't true lol. I applied on april 2nd, the last priority day, I've been checking the housing portal every day, and still haven't received any assignment. Should I be worried???",

Room assignment emails for all students that applied by the April 2nd priority deadline, will receive their email notification May 21st. If you have further questions, please email housing@humboldt.edu",

I was expecting May 21st as well and was also pretty worried, I didn\u2019t think so many people would move on to campus this fall. I think there should be more room opening now that ppl have the chance to room with someone",

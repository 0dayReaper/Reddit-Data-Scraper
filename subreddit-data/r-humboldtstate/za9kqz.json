    "postText": "Hello!! I plan to attend HSU in a year from now and I have a lot of questions! My major of choice is wildlife biology - management and conservation.\n\nFeel free to answer any that you'd like. I would GLADLY appreciate it!!\n\nWhat does the wildlife biology program look like from your perspective?  \nHow often are you out in nature for education purposes?  \nWhat kind of job opportunities have you seen recently?  \nWhat's your end goal as a wildlife student?  \nDo homeless people bother students on campus?  \nIs Arcata really as unsafe as they say?  \nIf you live in the campus dorms, does HSU group you with other wildlife majors?  \nHow often does the sun actually shine?  \nAre there really a lot of homeless people in the woods when you go on leisure walks etc?  \nAre you glad you are studying there?  \nI hear the wildlife program is nationally recognized, would you say it's a great program and why?  \nWhat kind of internships are you doing/planning on doing?  \nIs there a zoo there and how is it if there is?  \nIs it really really really rainy everyday?  \nFor single room dorms, are they connected to other rooms or would it be a single room with your own kitchen and bathroom etc?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for answering :D",

            "comment": "I did that same program and graduated like... 10 years ago now (Jesus I'm old). I figure I'll give you my insight on what the program was like, and where it led me in life:\n\n\nMost of the 300+ level classes can be divided into 2 categories; the \"oligies\" and \"management\". The \"oligies\" are things like ornithology, herpetology, mammology, plant taxonomy, etc... These classes require a shitton of memorization, but by the end of each one you look like a savant to the average person. I could identify a frog based just off its croak, or I'd see a bird for a quarter of a second and be able to tell you it's common and scientific name, and it's range. I could look at a single tooth and tell you it came from an armadillo. \n\nManagement classes are things like wetland, big game, or forest management. They're basically the other end of the spectrum - a lot of theories and applied science, along with case studies and research. \n\nOverall you learn a LOT of cool stuff, and learn some impressive skills. However, you're likely to forget most of it unless you keep up practicing, or are involved in some type of general wildlife knowledge job.\n\n\nOnto my career path:\nEvery summer I worked a different wildlife job, and once I graduated I started looking for jobs in the field. I quickly realized that all the entry-level jobs were like 4-6 months along, then I would have to find a new job (potentially on the other side of the country). This wasn't conducive to being the newlywed I was at the time, so picked up a job working at a construction company for a year.\n\nAfter doing that, my wife got lucky and got offered a job in Hawaii, so off to the islands we went! I struggled to find a job out there until found some ecotourism stuff I managed to worm my way into, and I loved it! I worked that job for about 4 years, then moved to New Zealand, where I now work showing off albatross, fur seals, sea lions, and penguins.\n\nLooking back on it, I realized I probably would have been better off studying science communication or Environmental Management and Protection (although it was called NRPI back in my day). Probably would have done better in school too. But I ended up doing something I love, so I guess I can't complain too much.",

            "comment": "\n\n\nSingle dorms are usually in a \u201csuite\u201d with other roommates, so only the bedroom itself is private and you still share bathrooms/kitchen/a living room. If it\u2019s a single in a residence hall style dorm then you share the floor bathroom with everyone else. You have the option to be grouped with other wildlife majors if you\u2019re in a certain program, like klamath connection. \n\n\nThere are a lot of homeless people in Humboldt because people get stranded here- there are no trains and if you don\u2019t have a car or greyhound money you can\u2019t leave. Very few of them will be violent/bother people. They just panhandle and keep to themselves. Occasionally they will be on campus (some of them are students, and the library is a community resource as well) but they have never approached me there. I have stumbled upon camps in the community forest, but they\u2019re usually deep in, far from campus and off trail- not in places where it\u2019s easy to stumble upon. They don\u2019t want to be found anymore than you want to encounter them.",

            "comment": "There are a decent amount of homeless people in Arcata around the plaza but Ive never seem them bother anybody other than asking for change or a lighter and they never really show up on campus or the trails close to the school. The wildlife program is a really good program, its academically very rigorous so keep that in mind and do yourself a favor and always sign up for SI classes. The professors are all really friendly and welcoming and they all seem very passionate especially when it comes to birds As for the weather it is pretty rainy but with how beautiful the area is Im totally fine with it.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m in a position where I might have enough credits to be part time next spring. I was curious as to how part-time tuition works.\nIs it per-unit? For example, if I took 6 units, how much cheaper would it be than paying full-time tuition for 12+ units?\nAny personal experience is appreciated but I\u2019ll contact cashier/registrar as well",

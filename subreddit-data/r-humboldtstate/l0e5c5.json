I\u2019m going to be a teacher and I\u2019m really excited, I\u2019d love to hear from any and everyone, thank you!",

She's got particular expertise when it comes to transfer students, too. \n\n[tyler.bradbury@humboldt.edu](mailto:tyler.bradbury@humboldt.edu)  \n\n\nHope that helps, and we'll see you soon. :)",

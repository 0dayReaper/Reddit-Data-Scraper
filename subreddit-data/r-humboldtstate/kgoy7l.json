    "postText": "I'm moving to Arcata in June or July next year as a transfer student from Shasta College up in Shasta County. I know that most of  the students transferring to HSU are from the bay area and SoCal, but if anyone lives near Shasta County, I need help moving some furniture once I actually move there. I need someone who can drive a rental truck and I will pay 50% of the rental cost. I can't drive because of my disability and hiring a moving company is too far out of my price range",

While an officer is not going to arrest anyone for smoking, we refer staff and faculty caught smoking in violation of the policy to Human Resources, and students to the Dean of Students.\n\nRegarding David Josiah Lawson, we miss him and mourn his loss every single day.  As a parent, I cannot imagine the pain his mom, Charmaine, feels.  I try to honor that as I look at campus safety and the sense of security our students do (or do not) feel on campus and in the community.  Those efforts are at the core of what we do at UPD.  Aside from the usual things you would expect from a campus police department, we are also key partners with the Equity Arcata initiative, we participate in ongoing important campus dialogues relating to equity and student safety, we sponsor the UPD Scholarship for students, and most recently, we have launched the Student Safety Escort Program.  This program consists of part-time HSU students, who work with UPD to provide safety escorts on campus, as well as visible patrols around the outside of our residential halls and other places around campus.\n\nThanks for asking some questions I hear a lot.",

Which leads me to your second question...\n\nFreshmen now seem to be \"better\" skateboarders than the freshmen of a few years ago.  We're not sure why that is, and don't mean to imply that previous classes of incoming freshmen were in any way \"worse\" skateboarders.  Actually, I think they're probably responsible for passing down skills and raising skate-cred here at Humboldt.  Universally, the freshmen at HSU DO NOT like getting stopped for skateboard citations. :-)",

While they may not be illicit per the university's regulations, it seems poor form to be wielding blades in lecture halls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit to update: spoke with Chief Peterson on the phone per his request.  He is looking into the specific instance and will be giving feedback on what occurred within the scope allowable due to student privacy rights.  As a cheer for the man, he is clearly concerned with public outreach and creating rapport with the student body and creating a safe environment on campus.  ",

There are some technical exceptions, but they are too few and too obscure to be worth mentioning.  Anyone wielding or brandishing blades in lecture halls, or anywhere else on campus for that matter, is almost certainly violating the law and subject to arrest.  Please call UPD anytime you observe this happening and we will address it.",

Would you mind calling me at 826-5555?  I appreciate you bringing this to my attention.  If you ever get a response (from any officer at any department) that does not seem to make sense, does not seem right, or does not adequately address your sense of safety in the moment, do not ever hesitate to call back and ask to speak with a supervisor.",

While patrolling in a vehicle is okay, most of the officers enjoy the interaction of getting out of the car, and actually prefer walking around.  So... it is not uncommon to see officers on foot patrol, with their vehicle parked nearby so they can immediately respond to an emergency.  We recognize that parking on campus is at a premium, and try not to take up permit or meter spaces with patrol vehicles.  I totally get how frustrating that can be and I hear about it when it happens.  I will remind the team that they should attempt to park in designated service vehicle spots when they're out keeping campus safe... thank you for this feedback!\n\nPS:   We ride around on bikes too.",

    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nGot accepted as a transfer to Humboldt for Spring '23. I'm looking for off-campus housing, mostly because I'm engaged and nearing mid-20s, so dorms make no sense. I'm writing this to ask what do you guys think my chances are of actually finding a viable place in time to move in for the Spring semester? I have been looking the past few weeks and while I have certainly found a handful of viable options, it seems like everything I come across has a million applications on it. I talked to the off-campus housing lady and she certainly helped narrow my options, but it's still tough. I kind of wish I would've just waited and applied for fall '23, because then I would have much more time to look. Does anybody else have experience with this type of situation and if so, what would your advice be?\n\nI'm thinking worst case scenario I might have to request a deferment or something like that, but I know that kind of thing is hard to do from what I've read.",

Some students will be done with their program and move away. Not all apartment complexes have an online presence, so if you already live near the area, I would definitely drive around Arcata and look for any signage for apartments. If you\u2019re visiting campus, you might be able to find some flyers around looking for potential roommates",

HSU offers emergency housing for 2 weeks, you\u2019d need to contact Chant\u2019e Catt (info is on the website). She can also help you find off campus living resources. But your best bet is to try to find a private landlord on Craigslist. Just be careful bc there\u2019s a lot of scammers on there but they\u2019re pretty easy to spot.",

I read this announcement as primarily being about universal masking because the state had previously partially removed the masking requirement, and about large events. Given that the news release states conditions will be reevaluated in 6 weeks, I would look for an update in 6 weeks.",

I might draw a distinction between a special event that maybe is not critically important or can be completed over Zoom, and an in-person class that has already been reviewed and designated important enough to complete in-person. Like, there is a risk for anything done in-person, but instruction must continue.",

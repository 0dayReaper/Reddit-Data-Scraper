    "postText": "Hey ya'll, I'm graduating at the end of this semester and will be moving back to Los Angeles. I am thinking about renting a small U-Haul truck. I have some large items, but not much so there will be a lot of room left over. If you are also going back down to Southern California and need to move some stuff please let me know. I will probably be leaving the 21st or 22nd of December. So far the rates I have seen online are around $550, so it would be $225 each.",

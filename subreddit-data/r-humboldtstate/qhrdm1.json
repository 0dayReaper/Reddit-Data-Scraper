I think this has already been discussed, but if I have 2-3 hours to tour the CAMPUS and surrounding cities, what are some notable areas to check our?",

Super informative and helped piece everything together more + got some cool free stuff. if you're up there again I would totally recommend even if you've gone through the campus yourself",

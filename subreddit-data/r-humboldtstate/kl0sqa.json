    "postText": "Hello everyone happy holidays!\n\nSo question I\u2019ve recently been accepted for Fall and I was wondering how hard is it to switch majors. I\u2019ve never switched majors but just curious as to how to do it and if it is difficult to do so. I applied as communications being my major but I have experience in journalism and I would be curious to see how the program is at HSU and possibly switching.",

You'll fill out a form and that's pretty much it.\n\nBut if the major happens to be impacted... I think it's best to make an appointment with an advisor within the department you want to switch into.",

Not enough room to accommodate the amount of students who want to take those classes. \n\nImpacted majors are hard to get into, rejection rate is high not because you're not good enough but because they already have too many students to handle in that particular major.",

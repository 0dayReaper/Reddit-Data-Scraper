It was a joke to the English department, and is potentially being dropped as a requirement because it essentially tests for nothing other than highschool level reading and writing comprehension.",

Basically, if you do okay on written essays you\u2019ll do great on the GWPE. I feel like the GWPE is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, that\u2019s how easy it is. With that said, still put your best foot forward with putting effort into your writing when you take it of course.",

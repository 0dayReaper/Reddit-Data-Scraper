But I feel like HSU has an environment that makes it easier to not be segregated or put in the spotlight. \n\nProfessors ive had have always respected my trans and non binary classmates. I like the support groups too and my original on campus therapist works mainly with students who don\u2019t identify as cis, so it helped me a lot figure my own identity out. \n\nEven some of the not so polite freshman I had met respected trans rights. But of course this is my experience and being the introvert I am, it\u2019s extremely limited. I\u2019m not trans nor have I really put myself out there so this might just be surface level. \n\nBut personally, I think hsu doesn\u2019t do have bad and I like the few gender neutral bathrooms they have. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re living on campus, but people who identify as trans or non-binary will only dorm with students who openly Mark their housing application for it. So you won\u2019t be paired with someone who doesnt support trans rights, in my experience.",

I've seen them make strides for trans students in the last 4 years which has also really helped things progress. If you have any questions hit me up. Theres a pretty large trans community up here and the campus is not an exception.",

There is at least one trans professor I know of (English) and some NB folx in Education.  In general, people will respect your pronouns and chosen name - you have a place to mark it in the online systems so professors will know as they read the roster that you prefer to go by, say, Rose instead of David so they don't accidentally deadname you.",

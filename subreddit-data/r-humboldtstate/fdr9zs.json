    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI\u2019m planning on transferring in Fall 2020 and I have some questions for people.\n\n1. Is Creekview a good dorm? It\u2019s my dorm of choice I just want to make sure it\u2019s a good one.\n\n2. Do people spend a lot of time indoors or are there a lot of people outdoors?\n\n3. Is it really hard to walk around campus? That\u2019s like the main thing I heard about HSU.\n\n4. What should I bring? For rain, for nature, for dorms, for everything.\n\nI want to be the most prepared I can be\n\n(EDIT: I\u2019m also moving with an ESA I\u2019m not sure if anyone has any tips or help for that as well but I\u2019m just gonna throw that in there)",

            "comment": "1. I lived in Creekview my sophomore year, the hill you walk up can be killer sometimes especially if youre sore but the dorm itself was something I will always miss. My window faced the creek the dorm is named after and I got to take naps with the sun shining through my window listening the creek babble. There's a path from the dorms to campus that goes through the forest and taking that walk twice a day was very calming. \n2. Theres a mix of both, but HSU certainly has plenty of people willing to go to the beach or go on a hike at the drop of a hat.\n3. HSU has a lot of stairs, and a fair amount of hills. We aren't nicknamed \"Hills and Stairs University\" for nothing. However, there are elevator routes available and the [student disability resource center](https://disability.humboldt.edu/) is there to help if you ever need assistance getting to class.\n4. I'd recommend some waterproof shoes (not necessarily boots which can be tiring, just waterproof sneakers have always been good enough for me) and a proper rain jacket.",

I can always always park in the parking lot at the bottom of the J at any other time.  Sure the creekview parking lot might be full at night, but there's a big parking lot right at the bottom of the hill that always has parking.",

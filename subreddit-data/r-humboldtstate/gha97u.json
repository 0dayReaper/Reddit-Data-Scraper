    "postText": "I have a few questions about housing that hopefully some people might be able to answer! Me and my bf want to find a place to live next semester by HSU but are at home right now in the Bay Area. Will we have to go back to Arcata to apply to a place? We just don\u2019t know if we\u2019re able to travel there now due to covid and if we would even be able to stay at a hotel there because I heard that hotels are being told to turn away people from out of town. \n\nAlso what are people\u2019s experiences like renting in Arcata? And are places really strict about not smoking (420)? I know that\u2019s the least of my worries about finding a place but was just wondering :) Will I have to have my mom or someone with good credit/experience co sign for me? Because Ive never rented before just lived in the dorms so i don\u2019t know how it all really plays out when applying but we\u2019re trying to figure it out! If anyone has any advice on how to go about it for first time renters i\u2019d really appreciate it! Sorry i\u2019m new at being an adult but i\u2019m trying my best. Thank you all :)",

So far, a lot of the places are asking for you to fill out the rental application first and then they will schedule you for a showing. A few places have video tours of the rental on the website. I'm from down south so I understand your pain about not being able to visit, but you'll have to call any of the places you are interested in to see what they want you to do.  Hope this helps!",

Last year, I agreed to rent my studio apartment without seeing it first (worried about being homeless, school was starting soon, and there were barely any spots in my budget and I kept getting declined) and while the pictures weren\u2019t dishonest, they certainly framed the apartment to look much bigger than it was. I remember when I first walked in, I literally laughed at how small it was.",

That order will not be lifted until the state's shelter-in-place order is lifted.\n\nTheir closure is mostly about deterring tourism, because there have been incidences of remote resort communities having outbreaks due to tourists thinking they'll ride out the pandemic with a nice vacation. \n\nIf it was me, I'd wait a month to see if hotels open up so you can look at apartments in person. \n\nIn theory, a property management company could e-mail you the rental paperwork and remotely sign you up. I just wouldn't rent an apartment or house without seeing it first, unless I was desperate. \n\nDefinitely be cautious of Craigslist listings, and *do not* rent from a Craigslist landlord without meeting the person and touring the rental in person, because there are plenty of scams around.\n\n&gt; And are places really strict about not smoking (420)?\n\nNo smoking means no smoking. Smoke leaves an odor that isn't exactly easy to hide, or remove, when it comes time to switch apartments. At a minimum, you can expect to lose your deposit.",

The landlord almost exclusively dealt with college students, and while there was a high bar for entry, we didn't have cosigners, just myself and two others on the lease for a 3br. I know Arcata has been pretty competitive for housing, so I wouldn't be surprised if there are more hoops to jump through than when I was looking for a place, but definitely check craigslist and try to avoid the complexes if you can! My specific landlord was strict about no smoking indoors, but the property had a porch and a backyard that could be used, just don't expect to get your full deposit back if you do smoke inside.",

But, as anyone with common sense would tell you, hotboxing your house the day before a landlord inspection might not be a good idea. Smoke on the porch/balcony/with the windows open and hide any 420 related items before your landlord shows up and you'll be fine",

Not saying anything about your relationship just something to be aware of, if you can meet the rent requirements without him on the lease, and then add him onto the lease after you move in you are gonna have a better chance.  \n\n\nAs far as co sign you will most likely need one, if you have no rental history and don't have a verifiable 3 times the price of rent every month as income (not financial aid or loans, actual income) nobody is going to rent you an actual apartment (although you can still probably find a room for rent or a mother in law unit that is being rented by the homeowner and not a property manager, the bar of entrance is usually a lot lower for those, although then you will have a problem finding a room for rent that will allow a couple)  \n\n\nGood luck",

            "comment": "Hey, I was a first time renter originally from the Bay last year and I can tell you my experience and hopefully it helps. When I was looking for spots last year I simply couldn\u2019t afford to stay in a hotel. I know it isn\u2019t great, but you might want to consider driving up here, looking at apartments, and then heading home same day. I know that a bunch of the hotels don\u2019t allow out of town guests because I had some friends visit last week and I live in a studio. \n\nI personally rent from pacific properties management, it\u2019s whatever. Technically not allowed to smoke, but my neighbors and I all smoke, literally all of us, and no one has said a thing. That being said, none of us smoke outside. A lot of places are no smoking, but if you smoke indoors, it doesn\u2019t matter. My specific apartment is by a park and school, so even if my property management company was cool with smoking, I think there\u2019s a law about preserving nature that prevents smoking. Also, the other property management companies are interesting. I had excellent credit and was denied pretty much everywhere unless I had a co-sign. So if you don\u2019t have great credit, y\u2019all are gonna need a co-sign. \n\nAlso \u201cnew to being an adult\u201d lol I feel that. If you lived in the dorms at HSU, I\u2019m sure you have a good feel for the place and cool spots to check out, but if not I can recommend some places. If you have more specific questions, I\u2019d be happy to try to help.",

Most applications will let you know if you need to have a co-signer while filling out the initial applications, and if you are worried at all a simple email/ call to the company can clear it up. \n\nLots of places do prefer applicants with renter history, personal the only places that rejected my application due to age/ renter experience were private homeowners. When I went through companies they didn\u2019t care much, they just made sure my co-signer and I had good credit/ reliable income.\n\nYou got this, looking for places to live may be stressful but putting yourself out there and emailing/ talking  to who ever you go though for housing will help make the process go smoothly for you!",

I was also only applying to rental properties managed by property companies, I didn\u2019t want to take any chances with a homeowner in case it was a scam, but that was because I was really new and unfamiliar with the area. \n\nI think I spoke with people from 4 different property management companies and asked them what the state of my application was and I didn\u2019t get a straight answer. Ppm was the only company that told me anything, which is (one small reason) why I ended up renting an apt from them without even checking  it out first. \n\nAlso none of the property management companies charge you for an application unless you get approved.",

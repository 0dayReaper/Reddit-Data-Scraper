    "postText": "Throwaway because this isn't my proudest moment and reddit really knows me too well with these auto-generated usernames. Does anyone know the max weight limit for the beds/furniture in the dorms? For what it's worth I am working on losing all the weight I gained during the pandemic but as I won't shed all of it and I will unfortunately be between 300-330lbs this is something that affects me.\n\nEdit: not really concerned for comfort, I'm concerned for durability, can it hold me and not break or become damaged instantly",

When I first moved in I was worried about sitting down to hard but after a week I got over it and used it like normal. The biggest issue is the mattress itself. Make sure to bring a memory foam mattress topper that wasn't cheap maybe buy a 4 to 5 inches and honesty save up money for a really nice one. The mattress itself will cave in about halfway through the semester but a easy turn around will fix this issue. So don't worry about breaking it just worry about be comfortable. Also hmu if you ever want to walk around or something, I'm around the same weight so I won't judge at the fact walking alone can make you out of breath. :) hope this helps",

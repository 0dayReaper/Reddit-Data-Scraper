    "postText": "bruh. they emailed me multiple times saying that I should go to this event for the \"campus community.\" but then I was outside and I looked in the window and I saw no students. there were no backpacks or anyone college-aged there. just a lot of people who probably aren't students. I know not all students are college-aged, but clearly a lot are. and in the middle of the school day, obviously many people would bring backpacks. it was clearly an event for older people or alumni or teachers or whateverthefuck. idk bc this \"campus community\" bs is so vague. I wish they didn't waste my time inviting me to an event that is clearly NOT for students, even though I am a student. the website info is so small and vague and the shit they emailed to me was also vague. how am I supposed to know that this event isn't for students if they emailed me multiple times but with such sparse and vague info? did I get on their mailing list on accident?\n\nwebsite: [https://physicalplan.humboldt.edu/open-forum-event](https://physicalplan.humboldt.edu/open-forum-event)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am so fucking pissed. they claim to care about the students, but they are often so fucking vague with info! shit like this has happened before. maybe I am just a fucking idiot who cannot understand subtext. well I can't be that stupid if I got accepted into college.\n\nedit: ok ya'll don't understand, I planned part of my day around this event. like damn if I wasn't worried about this event then I would've had time to notice there was a Taste of Bim food truck in the quad and I could have gone there for lunch. but I didn't notice it, so I got a burrito at the depot (it was delicious, but like I can get that any day and the food truck is not there every day). by the time I noticed the truck I was not hungry enough for a meal and I had to go to the bus so I only got plantains. they were delicious though.\n\nok but also like what if I had walked in there and then everyone looked at me weird because it is not an event for students and I am clearly a student? damn that would have been embarrassing. so like that made me mad as well.\n\nalso this happened before, like they did not make it clear that you need your id card to go to the J instead of just paying with cash or debit/credit card like at the depot or the college creek marketplace or a vending machine.\n\nedit 2: I didn't want to say this, but since ya'll think I am a whiny brat now, I guess I should settle the score. I was so pissed because I actually walked in there (a few minutes late because I am an idiot), instead of just looking in the window. I hadn't even been in that building before, so it is not like I knew the layout so I could know which room to look in anyway.  but yeah, I walked in and everyone looked at me funny. not just a \"you are late\" look but like a \"you don't belong here\" look and vibe. it was so uncomfortable, I could tell it was not an event for students. so I left. that is why I was so fucking mad, not due to wasting my time but to embarasaing myself.\nhappy now? sheesh. I should have just gone to r/Rants.\n\nedit 3: this post wasn't meant to be just complaining, or I would have posted it to r/Rants. I meant to ask who actually was meant to got to that even because it clearly wasn't me.",

It is the university's obligation to invite you.\n\nI've read in this subreddit students complain about the lack of housing, that some students are staying in a hotel under university agreement because of the housing shortage.\n\nThat's exactly the type of issue to raise at the meeting you didn't attend. The forum was broadly about how the university is going to change as a polytechnic that, as we can already see, has increased enrollment. The university is seeking your input.",

Unions' locals can be quite large. in this case, Local 4123 spans over the entire state of California. Similarly, UAW Local 2865 covers over 19,000 tutors, readers, graduate student instructors and TAs at the University of California's system, once again for the entire state.\n\nThese 30,000+ individuals are about to elect the next president of their union, the UAW, one of the most advanced expressions of the corruption of unions in current days. Most of its leadership is in jail, essentially for having stolen the lives of tens of thousands of UAW members by signing sellout after sellout.\n\nThis election is a big deal. Seeing a candidate who is figthing against the rotten bureaucratic apparatus is of great interest to TAs and staff affiliated with the UAW in California.",

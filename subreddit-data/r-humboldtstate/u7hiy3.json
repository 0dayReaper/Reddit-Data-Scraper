Who\u2019s stayed or been inside a canyon end suite and knows what it looks like? Kinda disappointed by the lack of pics Humboldt has on the website for the housing. BIG THANKS!",

There are two mini fridges and microwaves also in this space. On either side of the living room  is a door where there are two bunk beds and one desk in each of these rooms. I can draw it out on a piece of paper if you want! I don\u2019t think I have any pictures of what it looks like.",

            "comment": "In my time, the entry room was a common area for the four residents living in the suite, with two residents each having a desk in the common area because there wasn't room for two desks each in each of the two bedrooms. There weren't mini-fridges in the common area unless a resident brought one from home. (We weren't allowed to have a personal microwave in my time.) \n\nWhat I described seems to be reflected in the [the floor diagram](https://housing.humboldt.edu/options/canyon), but I'll defer to /u/ashbexx's comment regarding what's in that space these days.\n\nIn the 1990s, the end suites were the most popular rooms on the floor, a sort of hang out spot. On warm days, it's important for one or both end suites to have their main door open and windows open to create air flow through the hallway. This helped immensely on warm days, especially for the poor souls who had rooms facing the afternoon sun. Without air flow, those rooms were basically greenhouses and everyone had a desk fan. \n\nI lived in Alder, and the side of the residence hall facing the hillside could be perversely cool while people on the other side of the hallway were baking, and not in a good way. The students living with the hillside had windows always bathed in shade.\n\nWhat I don't see on the floor diagram is a sofa. In my time, there was a sofa of sorts, and one of the four residents invariably owned a large TV, so the TV was located in the entry room across from the sofa. This just made the end suites all the more popular, with people piling into the room to watch movies squished together.\n\nIf you're thinking of bringing a large TV, communicate with the other 3 residents first, because there isn't room for a large TV in your bedroom.",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am a incoming transfer for Fall 2021 in the Forestry major. I was wondering if anyone could give any suggestions on what to pick for housing. \n\nI personally went to UCSC my freshman year and each dorm definitely had a stereotype. I was wondering if that was the case for Humboldt too. \n\nAlso would be nice to live with other people who are planning to major in Forestry/Wildlife as well. \n\n:)",

There is also an exclusive room above the marketplace that is really nice to study in. Only residents have access to that room. It has the comfiest vibe and an amazing view. And they're the nicest apartments on campus. No mold....yet!",

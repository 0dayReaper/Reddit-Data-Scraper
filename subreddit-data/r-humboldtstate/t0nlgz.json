    "postText": "I moved up from the bay area in fall 2019 and have lived off campus since I started HSU. I\u2019ve consistently had a hard time making friends as I\u2019m an anxious introvert who doesn\u2019t want to intrude on people\u2019s seemingly well established friend groups. I\u2019m also slightly older (25) than a lot of students and definitely feel out of place at times. Anyway, if anyone has any tips or would like to make friends please let me know! I\u2019m a current ESM major and love art, nature and eating. I\u2019m looking to be more active and as a girl, it\u2019s scary to do things by myself. Would love a buddy! Thanks for reading \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "Hey. Just wanted to give you my perspective. I was 30-32 when I went to HSU, ESM major as well. I'm also introverted and totally relate to what you are feeling. I hate to say that it took me a full year to actually start making friends. Mainly I realized that it was mostly the same students in all of my classes, so what's the point in acting like they don't know who I am and I don't know who they are? That was how I felt and acted at first. The thing is, you can kind of get to know people by seeing what topics they take on for projects, what they talk about in class, chit chat in between classes, etc. So I started to drop the act of \"I'm not eavesdropping on your public conversation I'm minding my own business\" when people would be talking before class. I just kind of started dipping into conversations. I started smiling at people more and just forcing myself to act social. Not always obviously, but when I felt like I had something to add. I don't know if that helps but it was kind of a combo of class camaraderie and fake it till you make it attitude and I started making friends. Try not to overthink it. Most people are friendly and if they aren't then fuck them.  \nAdditionally, I highly recommend getting out on your own. I'm also a woman and I did a TON of stuff by myself in my first year up there. Explored downtown Arcata, went to Patricks Point and Trinidad Head numerous times solo, went out to Cape Mendocino and Petrolia solo, beaches along Scenic Drive, Loleta, Ma-le'l Dunes, even the redwoods up north. I never felt unsafe. I was smart and told people where I was going and didn't go out by myself at night. I truly never had a bad experience not even a slightly sketchy encounter surprisingly. Truly, you're doing yourself a disservice by being too afraid to go out on your own. There are so many amazing places that are perfectly safe to go alone. Just be smart. Carry pepper spray.",

Your major is popular so you're bound to meet some class mates at stuff like friday roller skating and intramural dropins if thats your thing. Peep the posters around the gym and campus",

I just applied to housing for next school year in hopes of being able to make friends through that. I also have the feeling that I won\u2019t be able to connect as well since I will be 25 by the time I move up there from the Bay. I feel like our ages are not too far off from the average age, but what I am most worried about is my social anxiety.\n\nI am a Kinesiology major so I don\u2019t know anything about ESM. I have similar interests but I am trying to get into producing art rather than holding the ideas in my head and being able cooking more dishes. I know there isn\u2019t much in Humboldt County as compared to the bay, but what are some of your favorite food spots?\n\nI previously attended SJSU but dropped out. They had this app that people were able to post different things similar to like posting tweets on twitter. I wish Humboldt had a social app/thread, because its aleays nice seeing memes shared by fellow students (I don\u2019t own FB but there is probably a meme page there). Other than that, I would suggest clubs as a source of making friends.",

I wish I could take it on campus but I\u2019m the unit cap already. Annies in eureka is a delicious cambodian spot, they have the only good pho around. Siam orchid is a good thai place. Greene lily is good for breakfast.

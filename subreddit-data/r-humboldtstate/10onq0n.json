Our department is pretty small making all classes no more than 15 people per class sometimes less (my theory class had 6 students last semester). \nKaren august is fantastic she is mostly in charge of  upper class men and graduate classes \nI would say tho the school is moving most upperclassmen off campus for housing in hotels and other structures so I would definitely consider that before moving up because non campus housing can be a bit of a bitch to come by.",

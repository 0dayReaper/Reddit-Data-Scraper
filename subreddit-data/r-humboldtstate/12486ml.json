            "comment": "Short answer: no.\n\nLong answer: The school is going to be offering two more related programs soon so I doubt it will get much more crowded than it is. On top of CS there will be a software engineering, cybersecurity, and data science with their own classes and some shared. I don't know of anyone besides those who register exceedingly late to not get a seat in the class they need.",

Most importantly GO TO YOUR PROFESSOR\u2019S OFFICE HOURS and get to know them early on, as of the class doesn\u2019t, so especially if you\u2019re anticipating you\u2019re going to have a problem in a class meet it head on. Your professors aren\u2019t there to punish or shame you, so trust and depend on them and they\u2019ll guide you much better than if you avoid them.\n\nThat said I have a friend who graduated from the CS program at HSU and has a high paying job at a local hospital (always complaining about how untrained his coworkers are) but is loving life so it seems like its a better option than most.",

            "comment": "CS is not impacted for UDT students, and in fact you should have no trouble getting in, since enrollments at HSU were shrinking before the change to CPH.\n\nHowever, I recommend against going to CPH. Housing costs in Eureka and Arcata have been out of control even before the pandemic, the region's economy is in decline which fuels NIMBYism (similar to WWU in Bellingham, Washington), the only profs with half-decent teaching ability are David and Sharon Tuttle (who mostly teach lower-division courses) and Adam Carter (who left for the private sector).\n\nI recommend Chico State or Sac State instead. Chico State has the second-oldest CS program in the U.S. after Purdue and punches above its weight in tech recruiting. Sac State is close to UC Davis for networking opportunities and hackathons.",

    "postText": "Hey all, I was hoping to get some advice and/or tips about student life on and off campus. What are some of your experiences with accessibility / availability of part time jobs for students in the area? What kind of regular community or student events are held on and off campus if any? Would investing in an electric bike or scooter be wise to get around (long stretches of) campus and town, or would it be better to just stick to driving a car?\n\nHumboldt and the area around it seem to really sync up with what I'd like out from a University experience as a transfer student, (Looking to transfer as Undeclared to explore a few options such as Botany, Forestry and Rangeland Resource science) so I wanted to poke around for some info and perspectives before coming upstate to visit and tour campus.",

There do seem to be on campus jobs in the Depot and various offices, but they pay around minimum wage and limit hours to &lt;20 per week. Off campus, it seems part-time jobs want more of a commitment (the co-op says part time is 32-39 hours per week). So I guess it all depends on what kind of job you're looking for.",

I'm currently in a writing tutor training class at my junior college to help open up some opportunities, but I enjoy a lot of outside work like in gardens, greenhouses or being a field tech.\n\n I wish more field tech jobs had flexible hours because the last one I had was a dream, but I decided to get more serious about school again and needed to step away :/",

I'm in a writing tutor training class currently at my junior college to help give me more opportunities.\n\nAnd thank you for your advice about transportation :) I'm never sure what would be a better investment, like either spending money on gasoline or just investing in an electric bike/scooter. What would you say parking is like on an average day? Is there usually enough space in student parking?",

The parking situation is horrible, I park a 15 minute walk away from campus so I don\u2019t have to deal with that and don\u2019t have to pay for the expensive parking pass. Gas is really expensive out here and depending on where you end up staying the drive can be long.",

Make sure a dehumidifier or heater is available and functional. Read the lease carefully and make sure to ask questions if lease were to be broken, sublease, etc\n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "I've read on here that some people get waitlisted for housing, and it can be not easy to find housing. I'll be a Junior transfer in the fall and want to stay on campus. I'm hoping to live in College Creek Apartments. How big is the chance that I'll be waitlisted? I am already planning on completing the housing application as soon as it opens; I just don't want to have to find off-campus just yet.",

Your application will have you chose a 2nd and 3rd housing choice, be sure you know what you want those to be before starting your application",

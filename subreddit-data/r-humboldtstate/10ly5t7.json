    "postText": "Note: I'm abandoning thread but keeping this up as a warning to men to stay away from woke, man-hating feminists on campus that will find any excuse to ruin your life. To those who decided to respond to this thread, your replies have been redpilling to say the least, with most of you demonstrating EXACTLY why a post like this needs to be made in this sub. At a normal college, NO student wanting to go to school should be falsely accused of sexual misconduct by trying to socialize. These toxic assholes will use Cal Poly Humboldt's misandrist HR department to completely fuck you over, in my case over an \"anonymous tip\". Just look at these fucking replies, fellas, please, do yourselves a favor and go off-campus to date or make friends. People like this are better off left alone. \n\n---\nI graduated last semester after transferring in 2021. I've been to four universities over the course of my academic career including overseas, yet in all my time in college I have never had such an abyssmal experience trying to find romance.\n\nFor the people I see in this sub talking about how hard it is to connect, befriend, or network with others, you are not alone. I am an fit, outgoing, and relatively attractive dude who's had decent luck dating and forming relationships off-campus with non-students; however, I have never seen a group of college students who were more anti-social and straight up entitled in my entire life. \n\nFirst and foremost, after four semesters of study almost all the friends I made were from student clubs or the pool tables. Try to make friends or ask out a female classmate? 99% of the time it will end horribly. They all are in \"situationships\" or will just straight up use you for homework help/resources before throwing you away like trash. \n\nI have no clue if it's the women's studies professors or merely just what university students in general are like in the 20s, but as a straight male I have never felt so frustrated at the sheer disrespect, gossip, and transactional superficiality in all my 8 years of being in university. After the last person I asked out BSed me and blew me off this month to go see amateur fights after using me for a free meal I had to speak up.\n\nFellas, ladies even, don't bother trying to ask people out on campus or your classes. It's nothing but a recipe for drama and highschool-tier bullshit. Save yourself the stress and join off-campus organizations or clubs. Keep your nose to the grindstone and avoid these self-absorbed dyed hair feminists who think they're better than every man on the planet.\n\nSeriously. I'm not just being salty, the experiences I've had would horrify you. Don't risk your academic or professional career over a false accusation of harassment, stalking, or assault because you want to ask out the cute woke girl in your class. If you don't heed this advice it might cost you everything.\n\nBest of luck on your Spring semester y'all.",

So its just difficult overall unless youre some wook or some like hella alternative type of person. It is really hard trying to meet people alike me. I just stick to helping everyone out and just platonically being a great person overall. It is just hard to find someone that sparks that feeling within me like I have had with previous relationships outside of this area. \n\nMaybe this place just wasnt for us. It is my last semester here and I am a little sad I had not met any motivating person. It just feels like all these people were really affected by covid and their socialization skills are in the shitter unless youre in their clique or friend group. It really is like High school environment here. Maybe I just need to let go and just hook up with just anyone, but for me I cant do that i feel fucked up inside and I just feel like im wasting all my time. I am a good looking genuinely good guy and i know when people type that shit about themselves its a red flag but I know I am genuine.",

A lot of people are anti-social so straight-up asking for someone's number, even when they seem friendly, can become an issue. At the same time, I know a lot of couples that met each other for the first time on campus while they were students, and most are happily married now with kids or in long-term relationships with kids. My advice to you is to chill out and let things move slowly. If it's meant to be it'll be. Definitely don't let this sentiment be the thing that holds you back from finding your person because people who live here but were never students can be just standoffish &amp; weird.",

I don't agree with everything he said but definitely there are women and men that are shit bags and would use you. Life is tough and hey as a man you gotta be careful now adays because it's easy for a woman to try and fuck your reputation and life up. If someone says he's a abuser nobody will believe him if he Denies it. And in that case you're better off growing as a person and wait for a woman to approach you. Even then it might not go well. I think we all walk a path and some of us walk alone. Don't trip over women it's not worth your peace of mind. People always talk shit and it's easy to talk but it's difficult for a young man to navigate in a false image of himself. Also you gotta realize that mental health is serious and we all suffer from it at different degrees. Personally I don't ask for numbers anymore I just suggest them take my number and let them decide because man woman are everywhere and be confident don't doubt yourself worth. Fuck everyone that throws hate around. If you're a good person at heart life will favor you but just make sure you make good decisions. One last thing, try dating older women;)",

If you have been approved for housing, they will surely contact you directly as well.\n\nThis fall, there could be a new immune strain of the virus keeping things restricted, or the vast majority of the population could be inoculated and we'll have achieved herd immunity, allowing some semblance of normalcy. \n\nIn other words, it's probably way too early for the university to make a decision about a situation that could call for completely different responses depending on how the pandemic goes.",

Recently HSU has reconsidered the plan for fall, and we will continue to only have single occupancy bedrooms, with about 1,000 students living on-campus. Rooms will continue to be at the double rate based on the living area, and there will be no rate increase. If you have further questions, please email us at housing@humboldt.edu",

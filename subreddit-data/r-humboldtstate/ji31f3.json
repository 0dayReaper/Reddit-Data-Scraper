So if that\u2019s an aspect that is important to you it\u2019s a great choice. Their MBA program has an environmental focus and has a 100% placement after graduation in a relevant job. Cost is fairly reasonable compared to other programs. Cost of living here is really high, especially food and rent. Community is awesome and if you love the outdoors you will find yourself here. If you prefer more city life then you may want to look elsewhere. Professors here are approachable and progressive. Student diversity is not the best, but it\u2019s better than other areas.",

I wouldn\u2019t say rent is too expensive but most of the apartments are old and run down. But you can get one for like $800 that isn\u2019t too bad. Everything down south is way more expensive so in comparison it seems way cheaper to me",

    "postText": "New Wildlife transfer here, looking for info on textbooks. Did any of you Wildlife students need the textbooks from WLDF 301 for future courses like WLDF 311? I'm trying to avoid getting them from the bookstore to save money but I can't decide if I should rent or buy the WLDF 301 books from wherever I buy them.",

Some teachers will provide pdf copies of the books, or you can get them from students who found them online.\n\nIIRC for that class, you can check digital versions of the textbooks out from the library.\n\nETA: don\u2019t buy textbooks until you\u2019ve gone to the first day of class and the teacher has the chance to give you the info about whether you need to buy them or can access them some other way.",

A lot of dorms have weed smell because students smoke. You probably didn\u2019t think of this, but mold is a much bigger problem and if you have a roommate that doesn\u2019t like to clean you\u2019re not gonna have a good time. \n\nIf bad smells are a big issue, I would honestly recommend living alone over student housing. I pay less per month living in a studio apt with my own kitchen and bathroom than every single on campus and some of the doubles. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an option with freshmen.",

A public university also follows federal law, which hasn't legalized cannabis.\n\nFrom the [residence hall handbook](https://housing.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/handbook.pdf): \"Outcomes may include educational/administrative agreements or sanctions, a student\u2019s removal from Housing, and referral to Dean of Students, and possible legal charges (including arrest and fines).\"\n\nIf it becomes a health concern for you (headaches) you certainly could:\n\n1. speak to those students involved. They could smoke someplace else.\n\n2. speak to your living group advisor (a fellow student).\n\n3.  speak to your resident director (your LGA's supervisor).\n\n4. call the University Police Department. UPD will investigate cannabis use on campus, sending an officer over.",

    "postText": "I'm still taking community college courses, but I need to tailor my class for the next step. I *love* the idea of Rangeland Management- it seems like the perfect marriage of agriculture, forestry, and biology, which I love. However, since rangeland management is typically a career found within the federal government, usually located in the midwest, I fear that I will be putting myself in a box with this major. What if I don't get a federal job? Are there still options?\n\nIt's worth noting that I currently work for the agriculture department out of city, so I do have some opportunities for getting hands-on experience with environmental and agricultural related work. I'm not sure how I would get hands-on range/ranch experience, however.",

There are students who are being recommended to NRCS which can be found all over the country. Also rangeland is any undeveloped plot of land and there is management jobs for that all over California! I definitely recommend trying out for range",

A lot of the individuals who leave get into the BLM so yea it would be a lot of federal jobs but also in the private sectors! The program teaches you skills like how to identify plant, soil types and grazing techniques. This also gives you hands on experience like developing and installing springs systems fences and rain catchment systems. It gives you a lot of experience",

I am seeing know that many private/state/county jobs are options, too. Honestly though, depending on where my life is after graduation, I would totally work in Montana for a few months/years. It's actually on my bucket list lol.\n\nThanks for your help! :)",

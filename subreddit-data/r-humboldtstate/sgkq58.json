    "postText": "Hi y'all I'm gonna be a returning resident next year. I noticed that the housing application for returning residents is the last to open. So, I was wondering if anyone knows how likely I'd be able to get the same room again? When I did my application for this year, I was a transfer, and did it the moment it opened. And still there already was very limited room available. I'm in college creek if that helps. Thanks y'all.",

If you are in an upperclassmen area, you should be able to select your same room. The first 600 Returning residents to complete their application, will be able to select their room for next year.

Maybe returning student applications are accepted last to give returning students more time to consider their housing options? Like, if they open the application process early, they'll get more students who say they are returning, but then change their mind?  It doesn't make sense to me though because what matters is the consideration process on the backend, so Housing really could accept all applications at the same time.",

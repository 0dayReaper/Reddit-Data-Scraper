    "postText": "I tried. 350 signatures is not going to provide much backup nor will a walkout/demonstration etc of just a few people. I was able to get it shared across social media from some large verified accounts with 100k+ followers but it didn\u2019t help. It\u2019s been hard to do this all on my own and now I must rest. What I haven\u2019t disclosed is that I am a disabled student at HSU. As such, I must take time for self care and to deal with the decline in my mental health so that I can hopefully finish out my final semester and graduate.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to do this. I have accommodations that will keep me at lower risk off campus. I wanted to be in person for my last semester so badly. I miss the campus so much. \n\nI did this for everyone else and to try to protect the local community. I wanted to help but I failed. I hope I am wrong in what I foreshadow to occur in the next couple of weeks. I\u2019d rather that I was. \n\nGood luck everyone and have a good semester. I hope you all remain healthy. I\u2019ll update the petition further should anything change but I\u2019m not holding my breath.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m seeing some faculty now signing the petition and signatures are growing again. This is fantastic. I\u2019ve also been informed a news article will be written in the Eureka Times Standard and that some students are getting emails that some of their classes will be online the first couple weeks. Thanks to everyone for the support!",

I just spoke to a reporter from the Eureka times standard and they\u2019re doing a story about how many students are discontent with the University\u2019s decision. Should be out today. They are also featuring your petition in the article! We mustn\u2019t give up hope now. It\u2019s a small chance, but it\u2019s still a chance. Thank you for organizing the petition and doing so much already. As a fellow immunocompromised person, I am so grateful.",

To book with them students can go through vaccines.gov or Myturn.ca.gov. Local pharmacies can be booked on their websites directly just to give some further info. Stay safe everyone. Really worried about going in person in the middle of this giant wave for many reasons. Humboldt is really low on resources right now as is.",

            "comment": "Getting a booster for my kids was not difficult. Just a week's wait through my pharmacy's website. Create an account at the websites for CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid and see what's available. If the HSU one on-campus works, even better.\n\nI'd personally avoid the Target CVS. The person doing jabs was reading what looked to be a personally made list of advice for what to do after the jab in terms of side effects. It made every shot take a long time and it took almost an hour to process 5 people. \n\nThe CVS in Arcata was 5 minutes + a mandated 15 minute wait afterward to check for side effects (they hold your vaccination card for 15 minutes to be sure you sit it out).",

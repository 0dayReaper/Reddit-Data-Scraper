Any pros and cons? Anything would help me get more insight on that option\n\nThank you so much for your time and help!",

There are however limited cars on campus and unless you\u2019ve booked it ahead of time there\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019ll be available when you go to book it. It can also be expensive depending on how long you\u2019re taking it. I know there\u2019s day rate, but you\u2019ll have to be the judge if it\u2019s worth it. They\u2019re nice cars and they\u2019re clean.",

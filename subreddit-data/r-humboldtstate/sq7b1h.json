There were a few people I knew that would just walk off campus property, by just crossing the street by the Wildlife complex, and smoking on the sidewalk over there. From what they told me, \"The campus police don't care about things not on the campus,\" but I would take that with a grain of salt. They would come into labs High out of their minds almost daily without any issue, so they may have been right.",

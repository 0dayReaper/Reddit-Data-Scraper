            "comment": "I did it, and then went on to earn my credential.  I feel like it definitely made the credential program easier - both in terms of the entry requirements and in terms of the actual material already being familiar.\n\nI don't know how the capstone course (HIST420) is these days - I still took it with the now long retired Gayle Olson-Raymer, who was wonderful.  You may find HIST211, World History for Educators I (pre-modern) kind of boring and difficult to create lesson plans for - I'm very much the high school teacher, so making lesson plans for 4th grade standards was hard for me.\n\nA lot of straight history majors will tell you having to take political science, econ history, etc. is boring, but i actually found both comparative politics and third world politics to be my two most interesting non-history classes.\n\nWhat I wish I would have done is double-dipped with HIST 490 and still done a thesis.  Would've been really hard, but in retrospect, I wish I had that experience.",

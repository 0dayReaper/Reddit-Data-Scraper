I feel like I got a bigger bang for the buck at the J and at the J grill\n\nThe depot options are pricey and IMO meh.\n\nTake advantage of Ozzies to double up on meals. Ex: get lunch at the J/J grill then order an Ozzie with food for dinner to go.",

The Depot was a pseudo-restaurant... sort of Subway, sort of a coffee shop, sort of a hospital cafeteria.\n\nIf a person is not eating at The J, I'd do the math and see if a meal plan offers anything other than convenience in having a parent paying in advance for their student's food.",

I'm not 100% if I should apple for a single or double room. How lenient are you with that choice? And what was anyone's experience with the roommate finder? I think I'm just nervous about the whole experience.",

I love my roommate now, we even roomed together again for our last year. \n\nits nice to live with someone when one of the random natural weather events messes up the school day. its nice to just have someone next to you. if you dont like people it might be weird for ya, but make sure to answer truthfully on your roommate preferences cuz some people are just weird. being real about that.",

I like to think itll help in the professional world, to be a leader in some sense. I am hoping you get a good roommate though I get what ya mean. Just be comfortable and as considerate as possible, this is a time to grow.",

It was actually pretty fun reading through some of the bios. \nThere was also an instagram for new students to post up something about themselves, so she met a couple people through there in case she didn't hit it off with her roommate.\nThey aren't best friends, but they are pretty friendly and hang out when it'sa floormates type of event. She says she likes it that way because there is a definite respect for space and needs/wants in the room. \nIt also makes her be more conscious of keeping her side tidy. Too bad I didn't think of getting her an older roommate when she lived her at home. \ud83e\udd23",

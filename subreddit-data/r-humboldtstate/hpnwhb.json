Is there any advice I should give him that is newer than 1992?  I'm working on a \"Places to go and things to do\" kind of document for him.",

The bridge leads into old highway 200, I\u2019ve been meaning to explore it a little more but it seems like a nice hike/bike ride!",

            "comment": "The Google Ball does not contain this sacred knowledge. It may be that \"identity tree\" is a term known only to your secret society, and none still live who tell the tale.\n\nI have no knowledge of students falling from trees. I do hold tight to the tale of raw hamburger meat nested in trees, but it was surely not placed there to entice students upward.\n\nI'm not sure if the following changes occurred just before you graduated, but... the biggest change is The Depot. The cafeteria and candy store are gone. The whole space is now used for The Depot with very different food, and their delicious pizza is no longer delivered to the residence halls. If they serve pizza at all, it's a different recipe because the good stuff disappeared in the early 1990s. \n\nOn the floors above, the hair salon and travel agency are gone. The bookstore is completely revamped into a claustrophobic experience (no more open space where you can see from the front entrance to the back wall). And, of course, there's a clock tower and elevator on the quad. \n\nThere are a whole bunch of newer residence halls spread around campus. A number of the residence halls have themes now. Back in the day, I don't know that there was much more than a sports and upperclassmen residence hall in the Canyon. The Campus Apartments are now owned by the university as residence halls. A few homes around the campus periphery have been acquired and turned into offices. \n\nThe nursing and industrial technology programs were eliminated, as well as the football program. Well, a nursing program has returned. It's for established RNs with an associate degree wanting to get their BS degree.",

                    "comment": "Great info, thx.  The Identity Tree was indeed a sacred spot, a redwood up in the forest near that debris dam.  Someone pounded railroad spikes into it, making a single row ladder up about 100', where you could find two large cavities in the tree trunk.  There was a log book, plus hopefully some bud left from the last guy.  It was scary as fuck, some of the spikes were loose even, so you came to know your true identity in doing the ascent and descent.  In about 1990, local legend \"Blinky\" fell out of it, breaking bones, ruptured his spleen, etc., but he survived.\nAnd no, my wife and I don't like the new Spanish architecture.  We liked the old redwood HSU sign, maybe because we have good memories of the time our friends stole it.  It was recovered, and they were screwed, lol.",

The Student Rec Center is on the left in the photo. The Athletics building also houses Kinesiology, the pool, and Lumberjack Arena (basketball). I don't know if the original pool is gone; I haven't been in the Forbes Complex (I guess called Forbes Gym now) in years.\n\n* [Soccer field](https://www.flickr.com/photos/humboldtstate/5149673780/). This is where the lower event field was located, and is now half-encircled by residence halls. The road bordering it is completely redone, and the main campus parking lot next to it has a second entrance off of LK Wood Blvd. The new residence halls really are all around campus, but with more apartment-style living due to their distance from The J.\n\n* [Behavioral and Social Sciences Building](https://www.flickr.com/photos/humboldtstate/29752417748/). It's the tall one visible amid the trees at upper right in the photo. It's at the top of the hill on the road toward Redwood Bowl, before you go down the hill and back up to Redwood Bowl. To the west of it is the relocated Schatz Energy Research Center (not pictured).\n\n* [Humboldt Bay Aquatic Center](https://www.flickr.com/photos/humboldtstate/48755912443/) on the waterfront in Eureka\n\nThe Student &amp; Business Services building might also be new for you. It's a large building next to the main parking lot. Oh, and there is the Marine Wildlife Care Center up the hill on 17th Street. It doesn't look like much and is used for classes, I think, most of the time. During an oil spill it's activated as a treatment center for oiled wildlife. It's been activated twice, and is quite an experience to see during an emergency.",

There was one near the staircase westish of the Hill, but it was always a stretch to reach the first branch and I heard it was removed. Second one is legit near the back nine at the Curtain disc golf course (community forest right next to Redwood Science Labs). Had a rope and a rad web-net with some great views... in the past 10 years it is possible that all the fun things have been effectively snuffed out, but I hope not. Don\u2019t forget to add backpacking the Lost Coast and Trinity Alps, Mt. biking in Sunny Brae, surfing/climbing at moonstone and camel rock, and rafting the Trinity River!",

But the university responded by sheering the limbs off a bunch of redwoods, making them look like toothpicks. They eventually filled in again, but I expect the limbs are smaller.\n\nBut what do I know about redwoods? They're purty.",

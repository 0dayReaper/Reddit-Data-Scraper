            "comment": "Expect no contact until day one of class. If they have not published anything it will be published before class. If they are in person, turn up to class at your appointed time, otherwise if it is online, check canvas an hour before your class starts. You will need to get the Zoom link from Canvas to participate. If after the appointed time for the class session is finished and still no canvas info (make sure you keep updating the page!), I would then recommend contacting the professor. \n\nThis time is stressful for everyone. As someone who dealt with online classes last semester it is challenging. Your faculty want to work with you and help you, they just might need a little more time to work out the kinks with being online.\n\nIf you haven't met your professors before, I would recommend sending them an email, mentioning you are a student in their class. I would also include info like your preferred pronouns, why you are interested in their subject material, what you are looking forward to this semester in their class, a side hobby you have or are interested in picking up. In the email subject line, put the class code (department abbreviation, and the number), your section, your name, and the subject of the email:\n\nEg: \"RDDT101 Mon 9 AM Bellbellum Student Introduction\"\n\n^this is how you should make the subject for all your correspondences with your professors so they know who the heck you are. \n\nMost lower division classes will have some sort of introduction assignment the first week but I like to do this any way as a way to introduce myself directly to the professor and as also a way to distract myself from the fact that nothing has been posted yet. Once stuff is posted I usually jump right in and overwhelm myself (I have already made a passerine study guide).\n\nTake it slow, everything is crazy right now, we're in the same boat. You got this!",

            "comment": "Pro: Some really strong academic programs in a beautiful area.\n\nCon: Corporate food services and corporate bookstore and dismantling/wrecking of community services (KHSU radio station, art gallery in Eureka closed, Natural History Museum building sold and the museum moved to a smaller rented building increasing the cost of the museum program, closure of the nursing and industrial technology departments, and so on). This speaks to the sensibilities of the university's administration in the past couple decades, an issue affecting many universities today... more corporatized, short sighted and not as community focused.\n\nBut for you, the cons are probably the remoteness, and small town nature of the community, assuming you are coming from a metropolitan area. That said, this is what a lot of people like about Humboldt.",

I am in the wildlife program and love what I'm learning, there's a ton of wonderful professors and a lot of opportunities to work with them and on campus. I also love the access to the ocean and redwoods.\n\nCons. It's boring here. It's rural. Takes a while to meet your crew.",

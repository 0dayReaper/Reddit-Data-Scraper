    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI have a campus tour tomorrow and am very excited but have a few questions. \n\n1. Is there anything I should know about HSU? Something you wish you might've known before coming? Housing is a big concern for me.\n2. Any questions I should ask about the college itself? \n3. Things to do or places to see after the tour is over. \n\n4. And whatever advice you'd like to impart. \n\nI transferred to a four year uni right out of highschool and had a very bad experience with dishonesty and a lack of organization, which is unacceptable when I'm paying so much money. So I'm somewhat jaded with the whole \"Come to this uni and let us show you a pre-produced montage of why its like no other!\"",

People watch on your tour, try to really feel the energy of the place. I hope you like it! Also for after the tour, if its a nice day check out the beach!! Trinidad head and moonstone are amazing. Dont go in the water- far too cold and potentially dangerous if you arent real familiar with nor nor cal water. Also if you're a bagel fan- go to los bagels, just trust me. Cheers :)",

            "comment": "I transferred to HSU 2 years ago without going on a tour. I just knew that I would enjoy being in a small town because I don\u2019t like being in big cities. Plus my good friend from high school came here so I trusted her word. \n\nBut to answer your questions:\n\n1.\tHSU is a pretty chill campus. There\u2019s always something going on in the quad area like music, poster sales, clubs and all that. \n2.\tas for questions that may depend on your major? I\u2019m a kinesiology major so almost all my classes took place in the kinesiology and athletics building. Maybe you can ask where the majority of your classes will be?\n3.\tdefinitely try to hit up houda point, luffenholtz beach, and baker beach! (Get off Westhaven ave off the 101 N) \n4.\tAs for advice, try to make friends because it could get lonely. Luckily my husband and I transferred here together but we\u2019ve also made our own friends. Also, take your vitamin D pills.",

            "comment": "In my experience, what you see is what you get at HSU. I remember feeling similarly about campus tours, but HSU was better about it than any of the other schools I checked out.\n\nIn terms of housing, on-campus is fine and there's a lot of it, but the off-campus housing market is pretty competitive. You can find a place, but it definitely takes a little extra effort.\n\nFor a great place to enjoy nature or watch the sunset, check out the Arcata Marsh &amp; Wildlife Sanctuary, or any of the local beaches (Mad River, Trinidad Head, etc.)\n\nIf you want to meet up with a \"local\" or just ask more questions, feel free to DM me :)",

    "postText": "Does anyone actually use the roommate finder thing for on-campus housing or are more people like me who get nervous about messaging people first and just let fate decide or wait until someone messages them. I'm transferring in as a sophomore if that makes any difference, and I check it every now and then to see if there are more \"matches\" under suggested or if anyone has messaged me first but nothing ever really comes out of it.   \n\n\nAlso one of the questions is about whether you want a mixed-gender apartment (not the gender-inclusive room, it'll be only one person per room due to covid so I'm not really concerned for this, but I did select I would be comfortable with a mixed-gender floor and a mixed-gender apartment/suite) does HSU actually take that into consideration or are single-gender apartments the usual norm?",

We do pay attention to students that select mixed gender and those that don't. You can still change those selections in your application if you decide you would no longer like to be in a mixed gender apartment/suite. Please email [housing@humboldt.edu](mailto:housing@humboldt.edu) if you have further questions.",

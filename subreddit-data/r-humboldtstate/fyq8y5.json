It really makes it once you settle in and really find that solid group of people that really click. I\u2019ve had the same friends since the dorms and we graduate next year :) campus life is pretty fun if you\u2019re into clubs or anything and there\u2019s usually events going on all over! The concerts and school put on activities are pretty great too!",

So hopefully i\u2019m able to find a good group of friends who share my wavelengths.",

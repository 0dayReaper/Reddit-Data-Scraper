Go to the hardware store and buy 3-4 feet of the biggest heavy duty chain they have. Take an old tire tube, cut out the stem and thread the chain thru it (basically pads the chain so it doesn't rattle and gets in the way of thieves angle grinding). Get a key lock that is pick/bump resistant (spend 1/3 of what you spent on the bike). Pick up an Apple Air Tag and securely attach it to your bike. Register your bike serial number with campus police. Don't leave your bike out in the rain (it'll quickly rust). Try to bring it indoors at night or find covered areas with a security cameras. Lobby the school for secure bike lockers that can be rented for the semester.",

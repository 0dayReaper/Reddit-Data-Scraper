    "postText": "I got accepted a few months ago and have been looking at reviews and stuff of the area. It seems gorgeous, but I\u2019ve read SO many mixed reviews about the school and the English department. People seem to absolutely adore it or hate it, and it\u2019s getting confusing. I\u2019m nervous about spending a ton of money and not getting a quality education. How are the professors at the school and quality of teaching? I couldn\u2019t care less about party opportunities or nightlife, I just want to get a good education. \n\nAlso side note: I have pretty bad asthma, and I\u2019ve heard about a common respiratory issue students get during the fall and winter due to mold, is that true? \n\nThanks in advance!!",

It is really really wet and damp here, even with the climate change (we don\u2019t get nearly the amount of rain that we used to), and some rentals can be funky and not updated (like single pane windows or bad/lack of insulation.) \nThere likely won\u2019t be the environmental factors that can irritate your asthma, but if mold/mildew/pollen are an issue... we have a dehumidifier that we run pretty much year round, plus these charcoal pack things you can hang in your closet or in your drawers. We have one kinda funky side of our house with a window that likely leaks down the wall. We didn\u2019t discover that until we moved our couch to accommodate a bigger Christmas tree, and found mildew growing on the inside of the wall.\nEdit: I think a lot of the respiratory issues are due to stress, partying, and lots of pot smoking. And moisture too.",

            "comment": "Graduated last year (Spring 2020) English Major. Keep in mind I transferred in junior year. It can get a little funky during the spring and mold is kind of common in on-campus housing, so keep an eye out for that. It's nothing serious though IMO. \n\nAs for the English Department, I have mixed feelings about it -- Largely due to the teaching/ borderline preaching of diversity and representation when the faculty up until last year was nearly entirely white (someone please correct me if I'm wrong since I only took upper-division courses.) Other than that it was a pretty solid education, I wish I would've known more about the literary magazine, student newspaper, research opportunities, tutoring opportunities before senior year. \n\nPolitics within the department veer very much to the left, I mean it is HSU after all, but I've seen this negatively impact some of the more conservative students when it came to making right-leaning arguments in their papers and stuff. So beware of that. \n\nHighly recommend taking a course with Stacey if you can, he's on the retirement track right now though so you might not be able to catch him in time. \n\nBottom line is that since HSU isn't a name-brand school you're gonna have to put some effort into exploring extracurriculars within the English department in order to really gain some real-world experience. \n\nGood luck!",

I took the literary magazine class and I highly recommend it. Based on the classes I took diversity representing does seem to be going up but I've only taken a semester so I can't say that with 100% confidence. Very solid education so far for sure!",

None of my professors were bad, per say, but we all have our favorites. They were all very accommodating though.",

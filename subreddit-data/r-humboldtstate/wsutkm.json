If you have an Instagram it\u2019ll come in handy. \n\nIdk if there any parties that get posted to this page since I graduated in 2019, but there are definitely some cool popping events that have party vibes and good music that get posted on this page. \n\nhttps://instagram.com/humboldtmusicscene?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\n\nFor the most part the parties (at least the ones that weren\u2019t shitty or awkward) I went to in college were house shows. If you follow or know the right people you\u2019ll find them. I suggest if youre trying to find something to do this weekend, you should go to Richards goat on Saturday night. \n\nHere is a link to there flyer for a show they are having there: https://www.instagram.com/p/ChY5AeFOrp_/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll meet some cool people there that know more about the party scene then I do. Being 3 years removed from college kinda kills the college party lifestyle...",

There were fire dancers there tonight, very pretty. Also police coppos came almost messed us up cuz neighbor had fireworks. But everyone good, party fun, come party! When you at the j be bold and talk to people. When in quad or forest for smoking say, hey, when is next party, anybody got the address? Then keep ask, more u ask, more party you find.",

It\u2019s very mellow rural small town vibes. Small gatherings of friends usually. Maybe a few bonfires when the wind isn\u2019t bad and it\u2019s not freezing. Parties get shut down fast up here. You now live in a town of about 15k people. Welcome to nowhere, enjoy",

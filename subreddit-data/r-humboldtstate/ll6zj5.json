When I say that they are balancing the budget on our backs, I mean that tuition costs are rising, faculty are losing jobs, and administrators are adding these \"budgetary wins\" to their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Check out our push pause petition to learn more about our position. P.S. CFA has consistently argued that CSU administrators and Trustees must stop relying on students to make up losses in state funding through tuition increases.",

Howard Bunsis' findings significantly countered HSU's claims and demonstrated that a lot of the time when admin says that money is earmarked for something, they are the ones who label it as such. It's like saying that you can't use your own money at Bittersweet because you saved it for Brio. Except that this is HSU...and instead of baked goods we are talking about a university sitting on millions of dollars in CARES money and \"rainy day reserves\"...backed by a CSU system with 1.7 billion in reserves...all while faculty are losing their jobs and healthcare, and students are losing access to classes, teachers, and university support.",

You categorize all university employees along these lines, and then start purging the payroll of those who have nothing to do specifically with education, keeping only the bare minimum of janitors, groundskeepers, IT department, etc. \n\nAdditionally, an audit of demand for graduates of all programs, with a defunding of low demand fields of study, with those funds being 'earmarked' for a department with higher demand. If graduates from program A are in low demand, and even then their average rate of pay is comparable to someone who only has a high school diploma, then there is no real demand for that program. Those students majored in low value financial liability, and those professors should easily be let go. Their pay could be passed onto a new hire, in a higher demand program. Same number of profs, just not the same distribution. \n\nOur system is presently set up to cater to the frivolous indulgences of the boomer era. No one has the time/resources to waste 1.5+ years on classes that have nothing to do with their major - especially if they needed to take out loans for 1.5 years of education and living costs. Those classes cost not only the tuition (plus interest on student loans), it also cost them 1.5 years of missed wages and a possible promotion in the process. For someone starting at 50k, that's another $75,000+ in opportunity costs to the student, all to subsidize jobs that don't need to exist.",

I had no real opportunity to find a major or swap when I realized my major did not fit my needs or desires.\n\nBut back to the CSU GE pattern.  It's really not that much, especially if you double-count where you can.  Much of it is basic literacy for the world: critical reading and writing (so you can actually read and critique the type of articles you need for your major and write a proper thesis), some really rudimentary math, understanding the basics of how the society you are supposed to be part of functions.  I personally know people who went to college before a broad GE was required - the person then asked me in the midst of the Trump crisis \"What is fascism?\" completely genuinely.  (He has a master's degree in a STEM field.)\n\nPoint is, a university is to provide a *universal* learning, not just create a tradesman.  If you want only major classes, go to trade school, no shame in that either.",

The largest component, given the admin bloat that has taken place over the past three decades.\n\nIt would also require the cutting of some educators, but wouldn't result in lowering the number of overall professors, that number would stay the same at the very least, if not increase - but the distribution would be different. No more gender studies or theatre? So long 7 professors working in those departments, hello 7 new professors in nursing, engineering, business admin, and education. The number of educated employed professionals remains constant (or increases) and those who taught subjects that led to 25k/year jobs now have to go find work in the private sector.",

What makes HSU such an amazing campus and higher education a worthy pursuit is access to different disciplines, classes, and approaches to education. Graduation rates should definitely be addressed, but there are other ways of going about supporting students than just funneling them into the supposed \"money making\" programs of your choosing. Staff positions are also important to maintaining a successful university. That said, the system where upper-administrators are making more and more money, while faculty are paid poverty wages and students are struggling, needs to change.

Rather than perpetuating a system that asks people to be saddled with debt, so they can go onto an unfulfilling career in retail or the service industry, you eliminate the waste at its origin.\n\nIf those who teach these low demand courses struggle to find work in the private sector, then it speaks volumes to the low value of the 'knowledge' in which they are experts - especially since relative to an undergrad in their discipline, they'd have a masters or PhD.",

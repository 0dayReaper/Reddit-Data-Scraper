As far as Arcata options:\n\nSmug's - their cheese/topping game is on point but the crust is way too hard IMO\n\nPaul's LFNY - pretty good if you like NY-style pizza\n\nWestside - consistent but average. comparable to a chain pizza restaurant experience\n\nDutchy's - not as bad as people think, but way too expensive\n\nAPD - avoid like the plague\n\nDon's - never gotten pizza there, but their Vietnamese sandwiches are the bomb, so the pizza's probably good too",

They are only take and bake but it is definitely the best quality and taste in Arcata.\n\nLive from New York is just like Papa Murphys. Except you don't have to take and bake. Not anything special at all.\n\nThe best pizza in HUMBOLDT is at Headies in Trinidad.\n\nThe other commenter who did the pizza blog is correct about preference being the main issue, but as far as quality is concerned Co-op takes the top spot hands down.",

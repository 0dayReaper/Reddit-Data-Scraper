I have a little bit of restiance in posting on reddit for this kind of thing because it takes me out of being anonymous on here but I've realized it's pretty difficult to find actors up here.\n\nSo with that being said, if anyone is interested in acting in a short film please reach out. Comment or private message me and we can hopefully discuss a little more about the project.",

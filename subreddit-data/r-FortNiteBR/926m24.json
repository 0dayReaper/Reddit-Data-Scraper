Even TimTheTatman who plays very casually in mostly squad games scored close to 100. Granted it was just one day but 10 games is a large enough sample size ",

Shit is annoying when Myth constantly tried to preach that his viewers shouldn't be sheep and should be able to offer their honest opinions. the kid is so fake deep, it's hilarious. thinks he is brilliant or something lol. must have really grinded his gears though, bc he usually doesn't respond to non sub chat and I only messaged once.\n",

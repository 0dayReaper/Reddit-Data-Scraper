Also, they work in tandem with each other so you can be working in premiere, push a clip you need to add a motion effect to to after effects, and when you're done you can push it right back to premiere all in the same flow of things.

I feel like the movements are just a teensy bit stiff/linear in speed. I think I can see it on some parts like the scaling bounce at the end with the blue bar and the text, but I think the other pieces could benefit from it too.\n\nOne other contructive critique I could give would be to make the animation as a whole have a shorter duration. It feels just a little bit dragged out too long, IMO.\n\nThose things aside, excellent work!! \u2714",

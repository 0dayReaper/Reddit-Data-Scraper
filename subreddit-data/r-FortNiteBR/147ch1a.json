But when I turned it down to low it would let me past the loading screen. \n\nMy specs are \nA Ryzen 3 2200g\n16gb ram\nFortnite installed on an SSD\nAnd an Rx 570\n\nCould this be a hardware issue? I honestly find it hard to believe since Fortnite isn't the biggest hog for resources. But I'd like to hear other people's thoughts about this. And maybe find a solution.",

    "postText": "Okay, let me start this off by saying I know fortnite on switch isn't the best but it's all I have.\n\nAnyways, so what happeneds is I leave Fortnite open and put my switch into sleep mode like I have done before in the past, but now this time when I turn my switch back on and hop back into the still open Fortnite instead of Fortnite just auto loging me in like it has so many times in the past it now will bring me into the login page for fortnite. You know the one that asks for your email and password, but if I relaunch the game it will auto log me in like normal. \n\nThis bug is really annoying, and I have already try some things to fix it myself but none of them worked. Rip \n\nAlso anyone else haveing this bug aswell??",

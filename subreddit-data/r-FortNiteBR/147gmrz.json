    "postText": "Just what the question says. I was playing tonight and it got down to the last 5 or so. I\u2019m stuck in a bush waiting b/c craziness is going on all around me and I can\u2019t reposition. A fight starts to go down about 3 squares away that I start to watch. One guy gets dusted and then the next thing I know the winner immediately turns my way, hops down from a ledge, and lays into me with the mythic drum, killing me nearly instantly. He knew exactly where I was, but I made no sounds, no movements, no weapon reloads, nothing - nothing that would have given away my position like that. \n\nJust the same, I pop into the replay after to see if I can figure out what happened b/c there have been times where, yeah, they could actually see a part of my skin, or I moved and it made a sound, etc. so it was\nlegit despite seeming not at first. This time though, no he couldn\u2019t see shit, but what I did notice is that as soon as he killed the prior guy there was a jingle type sound that came a few times from my position that sounded like ammo jingling or coins, and he went to it immediately and dusted my ass without pause. I watched other kills of his before me and the sound never happened for them, and like I said, I never moved, reloaded, crown pinged or anything, so any idea what gives? Is this a legit feature in the game for loot island stuff or an augment, etc. or is it some kind of cheat he was running? I tend not to think a cheat b/c why would the sound be recorded in a replay, but I\u2019ve seen nothing about this anywhere, so want to see if I\u2019m just out of the loop maybe. Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Appreciate the replies. Yeah, I had no crown. I also watched him for the few fights prior to mine and he came from a far distance, so I was already in the bush long before he arrived and he wouldn\u2019t have been able to see me get in it. It also definitely wasn\u2019t a guess. He heard the sound from where I was and went straight for it without hesitation, plus every shot was on target from the start. The NPC suggestion could be a thing, but I never saw an NPC with him and it never made a sound for any other fight except mine. I dunno, I\u2019m stumped.",

It's the only thing I can think of that makes that sort of metallic sound\n\nIt's also just possible he watched you go in the bush earlier in the game. Once it gets down to around 10 players, I focus on figuring out where people are even if I don't attack them. \n\nThe final option I can think of is that he just guessed you were in there or he was trying to hide while he healed. It's hard to tell since you didn't attach a clip of the replay",

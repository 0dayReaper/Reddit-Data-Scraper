    "postText": "And what's even more annoying is this community's smug attitude about it. I'm just SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO TERRIBLY SORRY I didn't have anything to play this game on (not even a smartphone), the money required to buy a battle pass, much of an interest in online shooters, or the time to unlock everything back in 2017, clearly I should be punished for getting interested in this game later on by being denied access to some of the coolest skins in the game forever with no chance of ever unlocking them no matter how good I get. I can tolerate locking original skins behind a battle pass, but it's a real bummer that they'll never let new players unlock certain skins of characters they might like for no reason other than they started later than other people.\n\nAnd my thoughts on the arguments people make in favor of these skins being battle pass exclusive:\n\n\u2022 \"If they wanted to play an (insert franchise they're crossing over with here) game, then they'd play an (insert franchise they're crossing over with here) game\": Sometimes there ISN'T a game for that franchise. Sometimes those games aren't available. Sometimes none of those games are in a genre they like or on a system they have, whereas Fortnite's on basically everything these days. Sometimes none of the games in that franchise are good. Sometimes they're too expensive. There are all kinds of reasons people want crossover skins.\n\n\u2022 \"It wouldn't be fair to the older players\": So, the only way to be fair to the older players is to be unfair to the newer players?  At the very least you could give the players who unlocked those skins the first time around some sort of upgrade to them that would set them apart from people who unlocked them from the shop. You could even lock the option of purchasing them behind having to have made a decent enough amount of progress (like, maybe you'd have to win a certain number of matches in a specific mode before you could unlock one skin, and then you'd have to win more to unlock another and so on).\n\n\u2022 \"Crossovers sell battle passes\": Smite does crossover battle passes too, and pretty much ALL their crossover skins become available in their shop later, but they still sell battle passes. True, there'd be LESS motivation to buy battle passes, but there'd still be motivation: The crossover skins would be available sooner and you wouldn't have to pay as much to unlock them as long as you played enough to keep leveling up and earning stars. Besides, I think the money made selling skins of such popular characters in the shop would make up for it.",

You misunderstand the issue and are framing it like it's some kind of problem that Epic hasn't been able to resolve yet because the players disagree. That's obviously not the case, it's a deliberate business decision. You don't have to like it, but it isn't something that the community is going to workshop.",

In many cases it would be a logistical nightmare to try to bring back a battle pass collab skin from years ago.\n\nIts why we even have trouble with collab shop skins disappearing forever.\n\nLike they could certainly bring back original bp skins (they wouldnt because it would kill their business model). It would be possible though! But crossovers are a totally more complicated problem.",

It's about ensuring that players who buy a battle pass continue to do so every season. The BP represents a certain time period in the game's life and if the time-bound aspect is removed, engagement probably dips quite a bit.",

If you're gonna argue for battle pass skins not being exclusive, it should be all of them, not just collabs.  Either that, or you should argue for collabs not being in [future] battle passes to begin with.  I would agree with either of those arguments personally, but just saying specific exclusives that *you* want shouldn't be exclusive anymore isn't really something I can get behind.",

All Battle Pass Skins Never return once they're respective Season is Over not just The Collaboration ones from Battle Passes. Without being Smug about it you listed honest reasons why they dont return and if you think about them they do make alot of sense. Collaboration Skins do Help Sell Battle Passes, having FOMO does have ALOT of players grinding and in turn Keeping the Concurrent players numbers high. If you could buy them in the Future at some point or Unlock them anytime you wanted then Honestly no one would see the point of Grinding or playing as much as they do. There are also some other factors that go into it too but for arguments sake I Chosr this. Trust me I know it stinks I missed out on a Few Collaboration skins like Aquaman and Deadpool but its not going.to change or at least it wont change anytime so I just try to make sure I dont miss any of the New ones that come out.",

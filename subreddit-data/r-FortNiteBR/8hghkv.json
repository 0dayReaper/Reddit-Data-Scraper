Try it when you get a chance: place a wall to your left or right and switch to ramps and look up and down the wall. Everyone knows the orientation of your character determines the direction your builds are placed, so face mostly forward and look slightly left or right depending on what wall you're attaching the ramp to. It effectively does the exact same thing as when you're looking at your feet but having the wall as a reference for your placement makes the control *much* tighter. Not to mention you're not having to take your eyes off the situation and you're not having to alternate looking straight up then straight down. \n\nNever had to actually sit down and write out how I avoid that small annoyance lol ",

In the creek beds when you place like a 10th of the wall before you can put a build at \"ground level\", getting built on top of, only having to build a 2 wall classic \"box\" to protect yourself, etc. I'll do some more visual explanations in the video I'm making. It's hard to explain through text. And it'll take practice to get your invisible boundaries down just like the OP's post is demonstrating.\n\nEDIT: Video is done and uploading now. Sorry for the garbage voice quality and rushed nature of the commentary and video. My internet isn't too keen on uploading a video of such titanic proportions (3 minutes), so it'll be viewable in about 30-35 minutes.\n\nEDIT 2: Here you go! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/kvjUA91bZ8I",

And once people realize how many cars there are on the map everyone will have them and we will be right back where we were a season ago.\n\nYou can push a cracked player with a car pretty quickly, almost as quickly as the stuff last season.\n\nWe have soaring sprints back too, and because the slaps have now taken over the splashes slot we have a nice mobility combo.",

You, nylon, and that one Aussie dude that\u2019s a pro paladins player started up a server together and I watched that for ages. You opened me up to resource pack making after you used that Default+ pack in your single player series, and now it\u2019s still one of my favorite things to do years later. I just recently came back to Minecraft and started up a server with my friends which immediately made me think of your channel. I can\u2019t put it to words, but even if you\u2019re a small YouTuber, you still changed my life for the better. I\u2019m 15 now and I will probably never forget your channel. Thank you.",

It\u2019s just been a custom one for myself to use, never thought someone would want it haha. Congrats by the way!\n\nEdit: [Here's a screenshot from the server.](https://imgur.com/a/LrDVIdo) I'm remaking my whole resource pack to match the new 1.14 textures, not sure about the cobble texture but item textures is something I'm focusing on more than blocks for now. I want to note that I didn't think my comment would explode but I guess it did. Been trying to make it look tropical to match the Island life we're doing. Sorry that I can't post the pack yet!\n\nEdit 2: Glad I made someone else's day as well :)\n\nEdit 3: I actually managed to finish it up!

It really shows a culture that is building.",

Thankfully such incidents have been rare.\n\nHe\u2019s carved out a small niche of friends with similar ages and dispositions.  It\u2019s very endearing to watch though I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll ever claim a BR.  \n\nHopefully he\u2019ll run into someone with the skill and patience to carry him to a win sometime soon.

They showed me the ropes, taught me the ins and outs, and were always patient. They really helped mold how I play games online. I was never very competitive to begin with, but they really shaped my playstyle around cooperation rather than trying to outright be the best. Hopefully this experience made a lasting impression on this girl. :)",

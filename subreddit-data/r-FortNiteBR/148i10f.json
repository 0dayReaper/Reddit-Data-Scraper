It has no point being in zero build.\n\nnot to mention this gives a heavy advantage for kbm players(not pc cause im pc+controller)\n\npoint is you aren't winning against a kbm with the MK.",

The MK Alpha is probably the best gun we have had in over a year(other than the mythical and exotics). Balanced gun which requires the user to have a brain to use it effectively.

I assume this is sarcasm but I\u2019m just an outsider looking in from the front page looking for perspective.  The game seems pretty fun but shooters and I don\u2019t get along so these gifs do nicely, and this is pretty hilarious.  Everyone is going to check tubs now.\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the replies!  Cool to see a community that enjoys the game this much.  Y\u2019all sound like a pretty fun bunch.\n\nEDIT 2: apparently this game is free, so what do I have to lose?  I got no rep on twitch or anything to embarrass myself with as it were.  What the heckers.",

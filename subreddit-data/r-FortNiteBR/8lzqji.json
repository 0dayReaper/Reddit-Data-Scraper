You wouldn't be able to get everyone to full shield, because someone has to go down. The only way to exploit it would be to have someone go down on purpose, but they wouldn't get the boost. Then they're just a mule I guess. \n\nIt could always be limited as well, say you only get the +15% once or twice max per game. So you can't abuse it but it still encourages teamwork. ",

In order to maximize our bandages (if we don\u2019t have enough to get everyone full HP) we will jump back into the storm to self knock and revive to get everyone to AT LEAST 30 HP. \n\nWith this logic, you can easily exploit 15% shield (because storm doesn\u2019t hit your shield) to turn into 100%.

It's not like this would be a rapid process. It's 10 seconds for a revive so from 0 shields it would take 60 seconds of just revive time to get to 90 shield not to mention the time necessary to get into and out of the storm to do health damage. At absolute best you're looking at about two minutes just to get a player to 90 shield with low health. \n\nIf someone can do that, recover health and outrun the storm while dominating opponents let them have it. They're obviously pretty good at what they do. I'll just do a shitty job of hunting the storm edge.",

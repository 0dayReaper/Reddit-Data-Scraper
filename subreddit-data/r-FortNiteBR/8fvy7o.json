But now with more computing power, we can just use the mesh (the model that you see jumping), and basically make calculations \"when bullet collides with model, deal damage\". This is a way more accurate way of doing it since hitboxes were literally boxes. That meant that they were too big or too small for certain body types. That's why you see some posts on /r/HitBoxPorn . It's technically not a hitbox, just a collider of the mesh. It doesn't really require any other programming compared to a hitbox. Instead of saying \"if the hitbox collider collides with the bullet, deal damage\", it now says \"if the mesh collider collides with the bullet, deal damage\".\n\nNow yeah, you want to avoid using too many mesh colliders and stick to more primitive forms as it can create some funky business, but that is a whole other topic.",

Why do you need a hitbox to confirm or deny a hit, when the mesh collider not getting hit is the same as not confirming the hit? Not taking dmg = missed, right?\n\nOr am I misunderstanding what you're trying to say.",

Instead of checking every single edge of every single polygon, you can first check that the point you\u2019re looking for is *on a particular piece of paper first*. You\u2019ve just eliminated a huge number of checks you won\u2019t have to do.\n\nIe the hit box isn\u2019t to confirm or deny the hit, it\u2019s merely to check if it\u2019s worth it to check the mesh in the first place.",

(not a commentary on you)\n\nSo, occasionally I will clip a streamers complaint about something something shotgun damage.  So far, I have yet to see an instance where the person complaining did not miss point blank and was hit point blank.  There are a lot of people who believe every shot they take is a direct hit, it is rarely the case.\n\nIf you shoot even just slightly to the left or right, your damage is lessened. If the opponent hits you dead center mass, it's higher.  This is why a stronger gun can output lower damage. This clip proves it.\n\nMaybe some just do not actually know what point blank means, but general direction is not point blank.  They also tend to misstate the damage.  Heat of the moment, I get it, but it's pretty common and once big popular streamers say it, everyone says it. The light bulb goes on *\"oh, yeah, that happens to me!\"*\n\nI am not suggesting this game is perfect, but I am suggesting we have selective memories and interpretations.",

So it mimics gross movement but little bits will poke in and out resulting in our normal inaccurate gameplay. \n\nWhat\u2019s special about this is that they either have a deforming collider that matches the animation, or they have a f-ton of small ones that are attached to the animations skeleton. The former being the more accurate, the latter being a nice compromise between accuracy and computation cost. \n\nWith how close that shaved his balls, I\u2019d say this is the former, but no way to be really sure.

I foresee losing 2-3 teammates every game at the start just from people who are afk or not paying attention on the bus. Maybe the storm could just appear after like 30 seconds, post-jump or you can only jump out when you're inside your circle. AFKs get booted right before the bus leaves your circle",

At most would be 12-15 chests in tomato and surrounding. Its a decent circle with decent loot drops in gamemodes like these, and loads of wood and brick, and a decent amount of metal in risky. ",

Seeing how the Blade was featured in the Season 7 trailer, loading screen, and Battle Pass banner, this is something they planned and worked on and were excited about giving us. Unfortunately, it was not well received (for lots of valid reasons), but to change course on this is a *major* decision. It has likely erased hundreds of hours of work people have done, and it's no doubt created hundreds more as it changes the course for the rest of this season and possibly others.\n\nThis can't have been an easy decision for them to make, but boy, so much love to them for making it.",

I think Thanos was released as a LTM back in the day because they couldnt easily release / nerf / buff / pull items like they can now.  \n\n\nSo I think someone was like \"hey we can go live with this across the entire platform and get real feedback / data because everyone will have to play it\". While in theory this makes sense (to me) , I think where they screwed up was they didnt act quick enough to all of the feedback.  \n\n\nWith how many people play this game, they got way more than enough feedback the first day of the sword being out and they still played the \"lets wait to get more data before making a decision\" game which ultimately was a bad idea. If it was any other game this would make sense but this game has wayyyy more than enough people who play this game that getting this data is 10 times easier than other games.  \n\n\nI do think future releases like this will be LTMs again or they will be faster at nerfing/pulling/etc   \n",

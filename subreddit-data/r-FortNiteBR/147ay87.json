Nostalgia isn\u2019t some \u2018catch all\u2019 for people saying they liked how it was back then.\n\nAt least then they still had the LTM rotation and even came out with new LTMs. Sucks that they\u2019ve given up on that, playing the same exact 1 or 2 BR modes can get tiring a lot faster than a bit of extra variety once in a while. Considering that topic has become a top post multiple times in the past year that they\u2019ve been doing less to no LTMs, it seems a lot of people agree that it\u2019d be nice if those were back.\n\nI\u2019d prefer the game with LTMs almost anytime over now without them.",

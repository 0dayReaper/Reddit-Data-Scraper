A Siren tattoo is by default a mid-tier blue, on the darker shade. His are black.\n\nSecond: Siren tattoos are asymetrical, leaning towards only one arm covering. His are symetrical on both.\n\nThird: Siren tattoos are more squiggly and, for lack of better word, non-shaped. His are wavey lines.\n\nFourth: Sirens are exclusively female (Troy from BL3 wasn't a true siren, he just got the tattoos and some side-effects due to being a siamese twin with his sister before they were cut apart - also, his tattoos were red, which is another difference)",

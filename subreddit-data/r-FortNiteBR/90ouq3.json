    "postText": "**Edit:** \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/90q2bn/summer_skirmish_week_2_friday_winner/?st=JJVL3H5V&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;sh=ec14de5c\n\n**Epic was able to conclude a quick investigation and determined no foul play (link above).**\n\n**I would also like to confirm that EPIC did reach out to me and assured that they cross-checked PS4 Machine IDs with IP Addresses, and concluded that every player eliminated by iDropz_Bodies was indeed UNIQUE.**\n\nAlthough I had sincere doubts this would be the case, it is somewhat refreshing to see. \n\nAt the end of the day there\u2019s no reason to believe Epic would be dishonest about this. \n\nI do want to take time to thank Epic for helping insure the integrity of these matches. \n\nAlthough according to the investigation, a lot of us were indeed wrong, especially me. I have no doubt that the backlash and the quick and thorough investigation into cheating by Epic games will work as a deterrent for future players whom may have once considered it. \n\nAt this point, all we can ever do as human beings is own up to a mistake, and give our sincerest apologies and congratulations to @idropz_bodies. \n\nAn even bigger apology from me, @idropz_bodies. I was the one who started this post, and although I only wanted to start an investigation, I know how these things can quickly turn into something more bitter. So for that, I apologize.\n\n**LAST EDIT:** \n\nGuys, I trust Epics response and investigation..\n\nStill getting a crazy amount of PMs from people who were in iBodiez stream and could swear Epic is trying to cover it up. Unfortunately, we would have no way to prove this, and if Epic says they backtracked IPs with PS4 machine IDs, the best outcome this could possibly turn into is a he said, she said. \n\nRegardless, I feel responsible for showcasing what a huge number of people still feel and are urging me to help exemplify, which is doubt, and suspicion beyond reasonable doubt. I feel this comment exemplifies the types of PMs I\u2019m getting best:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/90ouq3/comment/e2s88o5?st=JJW4DOUN&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;sh=9b6a7512\n \nAlso getting a lot of people who want the VODs of winners to be automatically released to the public. This is actually a very very popular request. I\u2019d feel guilty ignoring it. \n\nShould Epic release the VODs of the winner in every tournament? \n\nOf course they *should*, they own the rights, and they can put it on the front page of their very game like they did right after their other Tournament they held in Los Angeles. \n\nHell, they should release the VODs of the Top 3 players for entertainment reasons unrelated to being some sort of cheat-filter. I want to see these players go off when it matters most. I\u2019m sure many would love to watch these guys\u2019 10 Matches of them slaying out, as well. Don\u2019t see much wrong with the idea. If not for this tournament, then for future ones. If it kills two birds with one stone, awesome. \n\nThis post has blown up to become a life of its own. You hear the evidence from both sides of the aisle. I\u2019ll let everyone believe whatever they\u2019d like to believe. As for me, I\u2019m choosing the hopeful optimistic approach, because simply, I\u2019d hate to believe otherwise.\n\nI hope regardless of outcome, this shows the potential flaw in allowing competitive matches to just become *who kills the most random players in a public lobby*. Of course, if you\u2019re going to put players in the same lobby and make them compete against each other, you\u2019d have to separate PS4 from PC due to the inherent advantages of KB+M. Nickmercs might kill more noobs than Ninja and Tfue, because a major part of the public lobby tournament format is your luck into how many noobs you run into. However, if you actually put Nick, or any console player for that matter, in a 1v1 vs any PC pro player who\u2019s sweating for money, there\u2019s very minimal chance the console player can actually pull off the win. \n\nSo there are Pros and Cons with each format. Public lobby format has problems with uncertainty/loopholes. Private lobby format with all players in the same lobby has other problems because to be fair, you\u2019d have to separate the platforms in order to offer a competitive balance. Hopefully there\u2019s a middle ground Epic can figure out. \n\nMy personal take is separating console eSports from PC eSports.  There\u2019s a reason every game across multiple platforms does it. By separating the platforms, you can throw everybody in the same lobby, and have them battle it out. It shouldn\u2019t be that hard, and the money (100,000,000) is definitely there to do it.\n\nThis was really my last edit guys. Thank you for all the PMs and generosity in general, but I feel like I did enough to showcase both sides of this dilemma and their wants/voices. I addressed people\u2019s format issue, among many other questionable concerns, such as the huge concern of Epics stance of allowing KB+M on console, in which I\u2019m confident after a little more feedback, they\u2019ll definitely revert. I also echoed what Epic claimed as truth in their own separate post, because unfortunately my post blew up to r/all, among other subreddits, and I didn\u2019t want one post to get any less recognition than the other. \n\nYou guys are amazingly passionate. Regardless of the hate mail, I think this community is pretty awesome. \n\nSee you on the battlefield, I\u2019m landing Viking Village. \n\n**Beginning of OG Post**\n\nIDropz_bodies is a PS4 player who won yesterday\u2019s Saturday Skirmish. I was happy to see a fellow PS4 player did well, but unfortunately after seeing the evidence, it\u2019s almost inevitable there was collusion and corruption in his win and road to winning $130,000.\n\n**First, his stats:** \n\niDropz_bodies had a 4 KD in Season 4. Before the tournament, he had a 4.5 in Season 5. It was elevated to 7+ after securing a 45 KD in Tournament matches. That is a 1000% increase as soon as the tournament started, and a quick drop back down to his normal self once the tournament was over. He dropped two 20+ kill wins in back to back matches, along with multiple matches between the 12-19 kill range. If you look at his past matches in Season 5, he has never done anything ever close to that.\n\n**Suspect Replays:** \n\nAfter being accused of not being the one playing his matches (having his account recovered by someone else), he quickly shut down those rumors by streaming his replays on his Twitch channel. By doing this, he didn\u2019t know the biggest suspicion of all was about to unfold. \n\nDuring the streaming of his replays. Viewers noticed there was countless players who did not shoot at him at all. Instead, these players just ran up to him and although moved around, didn\u2019t really attempt to shoot him at all. There were even instances where players stayed in 1x1s within 5 yards of each other, yet didn\u2019t shoot at one-another. Instead, both waited for iDropz_bodies to easily build up, and without even breaking a sweat, kill the players. There was also instances where iDrop jump padded right to where multiple no-shooting-back players were, as if he knew their location precisely. This apparently happened multiple times.\n\nWhen some viewers backtracked some names of the \u201ceasy\u201d kills iDrop got. They found out something very worrying. These players accounts were brand new, and their first games just so happened to be during iDropz tournament matches. \n\nViewers of the stream accounted for as high as 10 of these ultra no shooting back players during both of iDropz 20+ kill games.\n\nBut what was most suspicious of all about these players.. was what was in their inventory. When iDropz killed them, they did not have any shield he was burning through when shooting (they were 100 health 0 shield). However, in their inventory, they had minis, half pots, med kits etc. \n\nFor those who are not aware, it\u2019s easier than you think to hop into someone\u2019s match. The suspicion is that iDrop had players Queue up the same time as him and give him free kills so he can place higher in the tournament. This is something that has happened before in the past, and still does happen in tourneys run by CMG/GB. It has happened in the past, and for a lot less money.\n\n**Deleted \u201cSuspended?\u201d Twitch Account:**\n\nRight after viewers switched their accusations from him not playing the matches to him having guys create new accounts and give him kills, something strange happened. People started sharing his Twitch because the proof was supposedly blatant and consistent through his matches. As people became increasingly aware, all of a sudden his Twitch channel was deleted, and with that, all the VODs of the blatant cheating. \n\nHe claims that Twitch \u201csuspended\u201d his channel because of a profanity he used during one of his vods from when he use to play Destiny. Could be true, of course, yet very coincidental and beneficial that nobody can see those VODs anymore.\n\n**Irregular leaving of Matches:**\n\niDrop was said to have left a lot of matches before the bus began dropping players, so that the match wouldn\u2019t count towards his score in the tournament. He claimed through his stream he only left the matches because he \u201cdid not like the drop.\u201d However, this left many to speculate after seeing the type of players he did run into when choosing to stay in a game, that he may have left those past matches in the scenarios where multiple friends didn\u2019t get in. Constantly leaving matches because \u201cnot liking the drop\u201d was NOT something we saw a lot of from other streamers. Some claim they think Nickmercs did it a couple times, but that\u2019s not confirmed. I will say that I watched Nickmercs stream, and did not personally see it happen. \n\n**Invited because of LTM win:** \n\nHe was invited because he won an an LTM mode sometime back in the past. I believe it was the Showdown mode. This mode has been scrutinized, because many believed at that time that people cheated, and coincidentally, had friends join their lobbies and give them free kills.\n\n**Epic:** Cause for suspicion is true and undeniable. There is only one thing to do. There must be a full-on investigation into this players matches. I recommend looking at the replays and seeing if there really is an influx of players who did not shoot back. \n\nAlso, I\u2019d look at the IP address of players he routinely has played with before the tourney, and the IP of the players who looked like free kills in his tournament matches, and see if any of those IPs match up.\n\nOf course it can be hard to prove corruption if you hide your footsteps. But there are mistakes and precautions that not everyone takes. When this much money is on the line, and there is this much cause for concern, due diligence and investigating is necessary on Epics part. It will preserve the integrity of future matches, and if there is no doubt that this player cheated, legal action should be apart of it. \n\n$130,000 is nothing to joke about. \n\nIf nothing comes of it, I\u2019m sure many of us will have our suspicious, but we will gladly take the fact that Epic looked into something that begged itself to be looked at. \n\n**TLDR:** Huge red flags with yesterday\u2019s Saturday Skirmish and $130,000 take home winner. Investigation is necessary from Epic. If proven true, this player is robbing Epic and other competitors in the Tournament. \n\n**EDIT:** Wow, Reddit Gold! Thank you so much! Don\u2019t even know what it is or how to use it, but I know it confirms what I believe. This post is IMPORTANT. \n\n**EDIT:** Oh my, second Gold! Wish I knew what it did, nonetheless, I\u2019m happy you guys share my concern. Thank you to everyone, thank you to the person who Golded me, and lastly thank you to the moderators for facilitating this discussion and help bring awareness to a very suspicious situation.",

Now that the individual in question has won one of the first big tournaments, they are now considered a public figure.\n\n2) There is no personal information or threatening of harm to the individual in question. The minute we see the post edited with any of that or any comments, they will be removed.\n\n3) All evidence posted by the OP is technically unconfirmed, as we cannot be 100% sure. While the evidence may lean one way or the other, it is still unconfirmed. OP merely presented the evidence he gathered.\n\n4) OP did not ask for a \"call to action\". OP merely asked Epic to look into the matter.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

Epic should not a have a rule-set that would allow someone playing legitimately, to come across so suspiciously. \n\nOf course there's going to be scepticism of the result when the viewers have been provided absolutely no supporting evidence for his results.",

The last one is the wierdest for me because the guy just stands there for 45 seconds out in the open walking in a circle waiting to be killed.\n\n0:55 Guy shoots him, builds up, them completely disengages and let's him run away to the guy below who was 20m away.\n\n1:05 One shots a guy holding a full pot who runs right into him without building or getting a shot off.\n\n1:20 One shots a guy holding onto a med kit+blue tac who runs right into him without building or getting a shot off.\n\n2:44 Guy shoots him once from 3rd story, stops shooting and backs into a corner to get shotgunned.\n\n3:00 Shoots a guy 3 stories up and then runs out in the open for 30 seconds while this guy retreats instead of building a wall and returning fire.\n\n3:23 Same guy is building towards eyedrops, gets shot a bunch so he half boxes up and gets easily killed through the open back. Carrying mini's.\n\n3:51 Kills a guy who runs past him without reacting to shots.\n\n4:05 Kills a guy running right by him with just a pickaxe.\n\n4:12-26 Right after the last kill, guy runs right past him, gets hit a bunch and runs into a corner to get killed.  He had a shotgun and a full pot, but wasn't trying to shoot back, or heal.  Just stand in a corner and die.\n\n4:30 One shots a clueless guy with a blue ar + pump.\n\n4:45 Guy actually gets some spam shots into him, but them gets killed. (This one seems normal)\n\nBut...and this is a HUGE but...  Look at the player mini map.  There is a player with a gold icon walking in a circle from 4:40 until 5:30 when eyedrops comes to kill him, and he drops a gold scar.\n\nYou be the judge.\n",

They\u2019re basically saying now, that no one has to stream, at that point, anybody could do whatever in their power to win the money. At that point, it\u2019s not a tournament of skill, it would turn into a tournament of scummy intentions. \n\nCMON EPIC, YA BUSTIN MY BALLS. \nI just want to watch a damn good tournament, with everything legit clear as day so we wouldn\u2019t have this mess in the first place.

They need to find a way to fix the joining up matchmaking, it ruins solos, showdowns and tournaments. ",

And for controlled competitions, I would even say the drop should be the same for every match, for any hosted tournaments and the like, obviously can\u2019t be done in public matches. \n\nThis is also something that can be monitored and scrutinized- why would someone competing in a competition not be checking trajectory of the bus as soon as they load in, and leaving ASAP to get into a new game quicker, and get to earned points quicker? Why would someone consistently be leaving the games only once the bus loads up and is flying? It\u2019s incredibly suspicious and only adds to the mounting evidence provided. \n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be allowed at all, no matter who the player is. All players in a competition like this should be judged in every game, and be required to use every game, save for disconnects pending game investigation. \n",

I personally think it\u2019s a joke epics allowing tournaments to be played in pubs especially when lots of money is on the line, I also think everyone should be forced to stream to make sure no cheating is happening, a hand cam would be even better, to stop ppl playing with mkb ok ps4",

But in his case, I saw nothing like this. It was only one key for anything he wanted to use just like on pc.\nAnd I\u2019m very confident that this guy was not playing with a controller.",

It emulates a controller so the ps4 thinks you aren't using a kb&amp;m, so the buttons on the kbm are bound like the controller buttons... no *major* advantage in that way, but the advantage comes in when you realize it gives you aim assist while aiming with a mouse, because you have the ps4 thinking it is a controller still. You see this by the buttons down by his building/inventory, it is still ps4 buttons. His building is honestly not *that* great, especially if he is using a kbm. He kept trying to show it off, but would constantly put himself beneath his ramps/just generally screw up. In my mind, he 100% was fed kills by friends, and i'm pretty damn sure he was also using a xim kbm setup. No way in hell a player this bad drops back to back 20 bombs for the first time in *solos*.

    "postText": "Excuse or dont excuse any passive aggressiveness throughout this as it will be turned up to 11...but the communal slander lately over last seasons mobility, (because there is still a vocal group still wanting increased mobility options back), has me a bit pressed. \n\nIf you have no life like i do right now &amp; want to read my essay on how to trigger myself &amp; the fn reddit community, maybe grab a snack or if you need help sleeping, reading my post might do the trick. \n\nOkay. Last seasons mobility was not an issue imo. Flat out. Not an issue like this community thinks they were atleast.\n\nMobility made games go fast. They are now back to being a snails pace. This seems to be an accurate observation atleast in my lobbies\n\nHonest question, do you really enjoy holding down the forward button while you watch ur character with non existent stamina(assuming u have slapped) run across the map for 5-10  minutes with no action gets tiring (like do yall enjoy that genuinely?) &amp; dont say this never happens to you cos thats BS.\n\nY'all that never liked mobility options, i dont care that you didnt like them, i want to know why you think they were an issue. Is it cos it didnt guarantee your kills? If so, well i say deal with it. Just like y'all say to ppl who liked mobility options to deal with it in this season. \n\nIt goes both ways. \n\nMore mobility will be back. &amp; people saying it was an issue it seems like this also stems from thinking longer matches are better &amp; or the way things were done in chapter 1 &amp; 2 is the way they game should be yet they forget the fact that fortnite is ever evolving. \n\nIt is (well was a faster paced game) what exactly was the legitimate issue with being able to glide across the map, or zapping away when ur about to die to save ur own ass, when u could literally chase them with ur own mobility. Ending circles last season turning into odm fest or katana fest was thrilling and chaotic, sometimes a bit much an ISSUE, because you didn't like it?\n\nIt sounds like a lot of bitter veterans that didnt like the games new direction but cant seem to give LEGITIMATE reasons for why mobility was bad. Just half baked ones that come down to \"i dont like it, strategic positioning &amp; thinking &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\"\n\ni can give several legitimate reasons why more mobility was good and not the issue people said it is:\n\nIncreased match pacing (subjective ofcourse, but i dont know why some people are in favour of downtime where nothing is happenning and im not just talking a couple minutes, sometimes 10 min plus without seeing other players, this isnt a movie where theres character building &amp; downtime is required for it) \n\n\nHelped massively with parts of the map with literally NO mobilty (which still exist) &amp; with quests especially with aggressive players interrupting.\n\n\nThey added new layers to zero &amp; BR, &amp; it doesn't just come down to whoever is lucky enough to get high ground in ZB, it gave those players tools to even the odds in that kind of dynamic. Those are now gone. Some will say \"good, it should come down to strategic thinking and positioning only\", well i say, WHY NOT BOTH?, like yall dont like gameplay diversity which your precious chapter 1 and 2 lacked?\n\nMobility options had cool down so were BALANCED\n\nMobility options didnt hurt the game. &amp; when the complainers used them against others i guarantee you they were quiet about it cos its okay when you did it but when others did, then it becomes a problem.\n\n\nThis season like the last, cars, bikes are often terrain mismatched resulting in speeds slower than sprint, they are few and far between. \n\nGrind rails, literally could have them like my vine suggestion below going through out the old map parts yet they are limited to pocketed areas and pois. \n\nZiplines. Could use more of those.\n\nAerialist? Is now gone or atleast i havent been able to roll it &amp; so with the new jungle &amp; clunkiness, death by fall dmg more than ever is very much a thing &amp; i know im not the only one ofc(but skill issue ig\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f) \n\nVines...relegated to jungle...why there arent more vines extended outwards to all regions of the map, like spirit vines in avatar, like okay if we cant all agree on lack of or too much mobility, surely more vines across map isnt an issue???\n\nRaptors, relegated to jungle, good luck getting those out of the jungle area alive in \"sweaty\" lobbies. \n\nBoars &amp; wolves...not only few and far between but weaker than raptors. But hey, atleast they brought them back. \n\nOverall, me personally all i want is the katana back, ill concede to that rather than odm as well or grapple gloves whatever. But this post was never about bringing back mobility but more mobility wasnt an issue. The new jungle is GREAT, &amp; the mobility options in there are decent while its the old map parts that really suffer. \n\nAgree? disagree? Should i cope harder? Am i dead wrong? Sound off. I really wana know why people think it was an issue.",

Again it goes both ways.\n\nCurrently mobility isnt fine. What is wrong with items that allow us to zip round the map that have a cooldown, inherently?\n\nIf we had items that allowed us to do that from chapter 1, would you &amp; others have an issue with it, i don't think you would. \n\nWho is to say zipping round the map isn't the natural evolution of fortnite now.",

The problem with the whole cooldown thing is that most of these items have enough distance gain to not even worry about the cool down. \n\nSituational mobility makes more sense then almost needing a tool that allows you to escape any fight.",

That dynamic in of itself includes luck as a factor in that, with the random storm now, unpredictability of other players, not as purely as loot ofc. Its merely the same kind of play tho in the end. I could say, with the surplus of mobility in the last season even with rng, you should have made it your mission as i always did, as part of your pre-planning to find some &amp; if you didn't is it really the mobilitys fault? take notes on spawn locations or kenjutsu crossing which had guaranteed mobility. just like you could say to me i should of planned better and positioned myself more strategically if i wasnt able to get the high ground or didn't find cover in time etc.",

The sword, and hammer, were effectively vital to most players tool set. To effectively require these sorts of mobility items just isn\u2019t a design choice I think is good. \n\nSure, a player could have better positioning or get the drop on a player, but if they don\u2019t kill quickly, they run the risk of allowing the player to simply escape, unless  they happen to have an item to chase with, which then just becomes a game of cat and mouse. Items such as Rift-to-gos or shockwave nades worked better since they had a much more limited use and only served as a means of escape \n\nThere doesn\u2019t need to be an item with infinite recharging mobility or a massive pool of use/ability to dash across the map with ease. I\u2019d rather the game encourage players to stand their ground and fight rather then dash away as soon as they take some damage",

My own opinion is that there should be something to counter them. The lock on pistol was great. It was still a challenge to hit people with ODM or webs, but it gave me a chance. Anyone choosing to fly about in the open, should be at risk from something!! Katanas and hammers were OK to shoot at without the need of a lock on weapon.",

    "postText": "I only play zero build and having no movement items in the new season is making the game incredibly boring. I used to push every fight I heard to get every kill I could going from POI to POI. On new zones you could easily do a rotation for the best spot regardless of whether the rng gods favoured you which was especially important in late game. Even if you got zone you could still give up your position to look for more kills as you could just as easily rotate back. After you knocked someone you could also immediately push to capitalize off of it. Movement was the best thing in fortnite imo. \n\nNow fast-paced high-kill games have changed to games where you spend most of your time running around the map far from any action while hoping that you get zone in lategame. You need to decide between looking for fights and playing for positioning (boring). If you're stuck in zone now or rotating late for whatever reason you're just fucked without movement items. \n\n I've  heard many people on this sub complaining about people running away from fights using movement gear. This has never been an issue for me as you could just hunt them down using your own movement. A lot of people hating on movement also seem to think they're somehow better for playing safe rotations but in my opinion thats just boring as hell and zero fun to play. How do you have fun getting a victory royale in squads with less than 20 kills or &lt;12 kills in duos?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: no movement = boring, slower paced games with fewer kills",

I can't play fortnite because I want high kill games? \n\nThe rng thing isn't entirely bad but you often have no way to counter a bad position. You have no builds, no movement. In other games like apex with higher ttk and faster movement und also still have abilities.\n\nIf the 4th-5th zone pulls away hard I want to be able to quickly rotate to a good spot if I can determine one. Why do you think that this is so bad? Some rotations especially in the snow area are just so risky and slow without movement.",

The SBMM should effect there too? To me it seems the floor is lower on build than zero build and I am wiping the floor all day long \ud83d\ude0e\n\nBuild mode is the default mode, with significantly more players, which means if you're in the lower SBMM brackets, you'll get into more games with more bots and bottom ability players.\n\nBut the medium and top lobbies have significantly better players, because zero build is literally the easier game mode for lower ability players. It requires a lower skill level, and a smaller set of abilities.",

Storm circle was smaller and i was in danger zone.  I jumped away and slid down the hill they fired at my back and i spun around and blasted them with barely any health left.  In general they had the upperhand for like 2 minutes without me firing back and i got lucky.    I even filmed the kill cause i was shocked",

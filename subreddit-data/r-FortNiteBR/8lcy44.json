Not even one gray pistol? I find that pretty hard to believe. Anyone who is familiar with the basis of the game(especially running away from the storm and hiding), you would most definitely get a gun.\n\nApparent noob who doesn't have a gun automatically knows how to use a jetpack. A command that's never been used before today. Double jumping for no reason AND holding it the first time? Hmmk.\n\nEdit: I understand that you may have done/seen similar things(even though personally, I've never seen anyone in top 10 not pull out a gun/try to somewhat win). It's in combination of everything that I'm skeptical about. The whole thing could be legit, I'm just stating my personal opinion that it seems a little set up to me.",

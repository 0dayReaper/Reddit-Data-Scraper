    "postText": "Does anyone else feel like fortnite has given up actually TRYING with battle passes? Like, if you were to look back into season 2-8 during chapter 1 and even a few battle passes in chapter 2 you could literally see how much of a difference there is in the skins cosmetics whatever compared to now!\n\ni mean tier 1 used to have 2 skins and one would be an upgradable skin the other just a sick unique styled skin, throughout you\u2019d find more skins with more unique designs for example tier 70 used to be something sick like dark voyager or valor for season 4. but even with tier 100 i feel like it\u2019s downgraded a huge amount like now usually it\u2019s just a boring skin or a crossover don\u2019t get me wrong im all for the crossovers but still.\n\nAnd as for the the \u201csecret skins\u201d you used to be hyped to unlock the challenges in order to have that secret skin revealed. nowadays it\u2019s just here\u2019s the skin you can unlock in 27 days and it\u2019s just so much less exciting than it used to be.",

I guess the people who originally designed the STW art style, and early BR skins are gone. \n\nYou can kinda tell younger people are designing these ones, I guess they hired new people, or they just don't want to/aren't allowed to make them look more fortnitey.\n\nSo many skins are so oddly lanky, and are extremely overdesigned/have too much detail.",

For one they could have given him Stratosphere as a Glider. They could have easily made a metallic red and blue weapon wrap for him. They could have given him an additional built-in emote that deployed his forearm swords as an alternate pickaxe. They could have easily given him the \"Arrival\" remix from the movie as a lobby track. Finally he could have had a universal emote that is him playing with his G1 toy. throw in the content from the quest unlocks and that's more than enough for two pages of rewards but for some reason Era got 3 pages because again SEASON 3'S BP IS CREATIVELY BANKRUPT.",

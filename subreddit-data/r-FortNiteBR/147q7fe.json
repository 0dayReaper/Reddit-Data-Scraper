He watches me play on PC and always wants to play mouse and keyboard\n\nim not sure I want to build him a full blown gaming tower yet. But I was considering something like a steam deck with a dock to use to attach a keyboard and mouse to it. Would be cool as he can also use it as we travel in the car etc..",

I think the game right now makes you think ahead and move early and be deliberate with fight selection late in game. At the same time, people who are more calculated have time to slow down and not go into panic mode because somebody katana\u2019s on to them. The pace is slower which favors certain types of people. I used to get flustered when I heard that sword sound or ODM and make bad decision in the final 5 players. This season, I know I got time to make a sound decision, especially with high ground.",

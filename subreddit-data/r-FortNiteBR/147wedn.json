    "postText": "I feel like it's getting really obvious, jungle, raptors unvaulted, EVEN new raptor eggs. Maybe we might get the collab soon in the summer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome ideas if the collab does come out:\n\n\\- A raptor meant to look or be like Blue from the movies (maybe she's a boss and you can ride her, she can also have extra hp or attacks the player can control while riding her)\n\n\\- A T-rex boss. Imagine your just peacefully walking in the jungle and a huge T-rex starts trying to fight you. It could drop some special item or weapon when killed.\n\n\\- Those jeeps from the movies\n\n\\- Ballers unvaulted for event\n\n\\- Easter Eggs around the jungle (A broken down jeep as Dennis Nedry easter egg, T-rex footsteps,  Plane Crash from Jurrasic Park 3 etc.)\n\n\\- Dilophosaurus in the jungle acting like pests (the dinos that have those neck frills and spit poison)\n\nAny other ideas y'all have?\n\nEDIT AFTER READING REPLIES: Okay, I really am not saying that the collab is going to come. I'm just giving my own additions IF it DID come. Like I'm ok if the collab does not arrive. Y'all take this way too seriously sometimes...",

Thats all I want.\n\nIn all seriousness though, rex would be a hella good idea. Even better if you can knock it out with the boomerang, tame it with meat, and reenact Ark in Fortnite. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)",

While I don't hype myself up for, as of yet, unofficial collabs, I will say my most desired would be an Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler skins; and a mini JP twin door backbling with an explorer glider.\n\nCould it happen? With Fortnite, it's when, not if, so I'd say that's what I'd want whenever it happens.",

    "postText": "I have never played Arena since its release because I was not a skilled player and when I say never played I meant like not even touching It, I completely forgot it\u2019s existence When CH2 S7 Started and Up to C4S2\u2026When Ranked mode was Announced!\n\nWhen Ranked was Announced I didn\u2019t Really Cared because\u2026I\u2019m a Average Player not a Sweat so I was going to get Destroyed In 5 Seconds when I land!\n\nHowever, now, as of June 14, 2023, I finally gave Ranked Mode a try, and I have some positive and negative thoughts about it! (Let\u2019s hope an Epic employee sees this!)\n\nPositive Experience:\n\n- It\u2019s much better than Arena. (Even though I haven\u2019t tried Arena myself, I\u2019ve seen videos of Arena and Ranked Mode seems superior.\n\n- The Ranked quests are amazing. I love how we get new quests every time a new match starts.\n\n- Finally, there\u2019s no building in competitive (even though it\u2019s only in Duos).\n\n- It seems like I\u2019m always matched with players of similar skill level as mine, so I\u2019m battling against average players.\n\n- Love the Badges Design\n\nNegative Experience:\n\n- I wish we had all of the game modes in Ranked!\n\nBuild: Trios\nZero Build: Solo, Trios, and Squads\n\nIdeas for Ranked Mode:\n\n- We should get new Ranked quests when we complete the current Ranked quests within the same Match, So we don\u2019t have to start a New Game!\n\n- Augments That\u2019s only for Competitive Mode (Not Saying they Should make New Augments for Competitive)\n\n- REALSE ALL GAME MODES FOR BUILD AND ZERO BUILD, It Makes no Sense To not Add Trios Build Ranked and Solo, Trios and Squad Zero Build Ranked!\n\nOverall, Ranked mode is amazing, and I might be playing it more.\n\nAnyways, what do you think about Ranked mode? I would love to hear your opinions on it!",

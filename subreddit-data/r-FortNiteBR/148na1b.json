    "postText": "Back when I played in Chapter 3 S1 and S2, I remember I could move around during the Victory Royale pop up, and go next to my friend to use 2-player gestures. It was fun.\n\nThen I stopped playing FN for a while, and came back to it in Chapter 4 S2.\n\nNow I couldn't move after winning anymore , just make some standing still emote. I thought it was a bug and they would fix it soon, but now we're in Chapter 4 S3, and it is still the same.\n\nWhy is that? Did they disable it on purpose? Is it bugged? Did they say if it's going to return?",

We used to have between 5 and 10 seconds to position ourselves after a win before it \"locked in\". It gave us time to position ourselves and find the perfect emote and take the perfect screenshot. \n\nNow it feels like you have milliseconds to select an emote, and not only that, the entire screen turns a faded shade of blue so you really can't even keep taking good screenshots of the scenery or background of your victory.

You can yada yada about the millions of people who play FortNite, but they are divided among many, many different games within FortNite, especially Creative (which I almost exclusively play now). It's why Team Rumble was carved up and bled to death because there were so few players, and so on.",

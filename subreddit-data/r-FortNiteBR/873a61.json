I don't think it's misconstruing anything to dislike that he decided to attack someone else's experience with such poor reasoning. \n\nHe could have easily just stated his own experience. It isn't misconstruing anything to notice he ALSO decided he had to discount someone else's experience (and use poor reasoning to validate it.)\n\nI think it's misconstruing downvotes to act like they must be blamed on not understanding his overall point, as opposed to noticing his unnecessary negativity towards others and self-centered dismissal of the reality of any experience that doesn't match his.",

It is simply not financially viable to agree to crossplay and Microsoft would hold back too if they were selling more units.",

Definitely appreciate your passion, and we hear you.\n\nWe are regularly evaluating viability and logistics for new server regions, like a dedicated SEA region. Just like we stood up Brazil and Asia, and then eventually added Brazil to Xbox. I can say SEA is an active area of investigation for us. I can't give a timeline, but we absolutely want to make this happen when it makes sense to do so.\n\nAlso, a couple folks here mentioned cost/benefit analysis. That's actually not the core focus, or even a major factor in opening a new region. It's really about evaluating experience tradeoffs, impact to existing regions, etc. We are also exploring tech solutions to help make some of those tradeoffs easier to mitigate.\n\nThanks for being awesome.

Not costs, because it's literally inexpensive and cheap, but the fact that it just won't be at the standard the studios want to provide because what exists in the region is utterly awful.  \n\n\nThese studios don't own the servers that are in any countries, they are rented rackspace. The issue is that there are next to no datacentres and the ones that do exist are.... Horrific. While the surrounding infrastructure is even more horrific.\n\nIt's improving, but it's not there yet. It's at least better than it was when the mirror reflection ddos exploit was at its peak, which was at its worst in regions with poor infrastructure.",

Epic clearly wants to make players happy, but isn\u2019t going to fully route of putting every single thing on reddit into the game until it\u2019s a different game.  Honestly the only game I\u2019m excited for as all the triple A companies have nothing but garbage lined up for the next year or two because they don\u2019t get it.  All other companies should pay close attention to how epic is re investing into the game through esports support and further promotion of competitive play.",

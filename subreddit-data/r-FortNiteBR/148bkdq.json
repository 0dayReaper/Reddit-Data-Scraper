    "postText": "This is the second battle pass in a row where you unlock an item but don't get the items default style until the bonus rewards. I am the type of person that likes to play with a complete set if the skin has a backbling, pickaxe, ect. I use it but as of the last two battle passes Epic has been giving mixed match sets for certain items for example in this Battle Pase Rain's glider when unlocked you get the alternative style but the default style is on page 2 of the bonus rewards. The same goes for Traces backbling and its kind of annoying when I wanna use the default style of a skin I have everything equipped and have to wait now and grind to unlock the default styles for items unlocked at level 30ish. \n\nI get its a cheap tactic to get people to play longer but evidently if I bought the battle pass I am gonna try and complete it so I don't need that incentive.",

I just unlocked the radioactive Mountain Dew style for Trace's backbling and was confused because I didn't recall having a backbling for him yet.  \n\nI checked, and sure enough, I found the standard backbling style was locked...and I found its unlock in the 2nd page of the bonus rewards page.  WTF?",

Because Epic now has to make space in the Battle Pass to but so many styles, it has meant that all skins with a 3rd colour option like Trace and Relik don't get 3rd colour options for the rest of their set. And this dates back to C3 S4 as well with skins like Paradigm. Even Grizz which only had 2 colour styles didn't get any 2nd style for the rest of his set.",

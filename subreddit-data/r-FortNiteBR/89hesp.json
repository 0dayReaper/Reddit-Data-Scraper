One of my first routes was right outside of shifty shafts the house and cabin straight across but people started landing there every time. Best thing to do is literally try dropping at houses right outside major areas until you get pretty confidant and then you could drop in more busy places for chances at better stuff. When I first loaded up the game I just kept landing in tilted towers and found it was super hard if you didn't land first. So I started landing on the outskirts like the basketball court and then chopping  into the building below it was at least good for two chests but you'd have to put up a fight every other match.",

As I'm landing on a house in the middle of town, she tells me she's gone off to one of the houses way outside of Retail.\n\nI said biiiitch, if you're gonna tell me to name the drop, at least have the decency to back me up. Hell, at least tell me you're bouncing before I actually land, so I can follow and keep us from being separated. If you didn't want to go to Retail, you shoulda just named the drop when I asked.\n\nShe ended up getting rushed by another 2-man outside of Retail as I was making the long trek towards her. And that's why you don't separate from your team mates, kids.",

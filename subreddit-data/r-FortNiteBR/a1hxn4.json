This kinda bugs me since Epic will be making millions off of others ideas. At least do what TF2 does and give them a variant of the item they created that only they have, like the same skin in a different color scheme. Then again, if Epic started handing out variants for everything they were \u201cinspired\u201d by, they\u2019d have to give one out for almost every emote in the game.",

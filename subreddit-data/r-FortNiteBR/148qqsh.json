Here, user flairs correspond to skins you can play as in Fortnite: Battle Royale.\n\n**Post flair** is a way to categorize submissions. By choosing a flair that best suits your post, you make it easier for other community members to search/filter for content they are looking for.\n\n###**Changing your User Flair**\n\n* For flairs of skins released before/during Chapter 1: Season 8, follow these steps: [How do I get user flair?](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205242695-How-do-I-get-user-flair-)\n* For flairs of skins released after/during Chapter 1: Season 9, go here: [SeeBot | Reddit Flair Picker](https://seebot.dev/flairs.php)\n* If you are requesting that a skin be added as a flair option, please note that the flairs are not updated on a set schedule and so it may take time for the flair you are looking for to be added. If the flair you want is for a skin that released some time ago, you can [send us a message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/FortNiteBR&amp;subject=User%20Flair%20Request&amp;message=I%20would%20like%20to%20request%20that%20the%20following%20skin%20be%20made%20available%20as%20a%20user%20flair:) to formally request it.\n\n###**Choosing the right Post Flair**\n\nWhile most post flair options are self-explanatory, you may find yourself in the position where you are not sure which flair best fits your content. In these situations, simply choose a flair that you think relates to what you are posting.\n\n* There is no need to apologize for your flair choice in your post title, if a moderator thinks the wrong flair was used they will change it\n* If a moderator *does* change your post flair, they did so for a reason - please do not change it back\n* If you are unsure if the flair you chose is correct, you can [search the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/fortnitebr/search) to see if there is similar content under the same flair (search for `flair:\"name of flair\"`)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/FortNiteBR) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

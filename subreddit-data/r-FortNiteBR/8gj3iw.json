Could never imagine handing my account over to some stranger. 10 years of gaming, don't even want to know the totally amount of $$ I've spent on digital downloads on mine over the years. If my account was ever compromised and lost, that would be the day I retire from gaming man.  Risky move but if it all works out, That's awesome.\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that there are many people out there in the fortnite community that would be willing to lend a hand and help a fellow friend out, but damn.\n\nEither way I hope this is the and OP doesn't lose anything from it.

You don't fuck around with a Concussion, that shit can really mess you up, for life. \n\nI know a guy who got a concussion, he hit his head when he fell going up some stairs, a normal guy, friendly and generally well liked. He  talked to a doctor and was told to do certain things to heal it. Nothing major, he had to sleep sitting up and be careful with what he ate and drank, and that was pretty much it, and all he had to do was follow these orders for a few weeks. Then after a little over week of this he decided he felt better and it was healed, so he he went to sleep in his bed as he always had before. He didn't wake up the next morning, he was in a coma for 4 days, and when he woke up he couldn't move/use his jaw and the entire left half of his body was paralyzed. While he's still perfectly functional cognitive, he's now fed through a tube, wears a diaper and needs help to change it and be cleaned.\n\nI'm not trying to bring the mood down, but don't fucking mess around with a concussion.\n\n(This happend 8 years ago so i'm a little fuzzy on the exact details, the doctor might have told him to do other stuff and i'm only 80% sure the coma lasted 4 days, might have been more)",

Including shit like giving you symptoms that look like Alzheimers, it can fuck with your short term memory stopping you from retaining new information, which basicly means you live a life where you don't know you're unable to learn new information. You can end up loosing all previous information permanently (memory loss), it can fuck with your speech and vision centers. \n\nConcussions is not like most injuries where the injury happen and then that's it and the body starts to heal if it's not fatal. Concussions happen and then you might feel dizzy and throw up, and you think that's it. But nope, concussions are special because the bodys attempt at healing can cause more damage. A concussion is a very slow injury that keeps happening and evolving, it has more in commen with a disease that normal injuries when it comes to progression.\n\nAgain, i know this is a very serious subject to post about on such a lighthearted post, but a lot of young people are here, and it's an important thing to learn early, before it happens.

I like it because it clearly outlines the progression for return to play, and doesn't allow parents, coaches, or the athlete the ability to skip it.\n\nThe more we learn about concussions, the scarier they are. No game is more important than the potential long-term side effects of brain injuries.",

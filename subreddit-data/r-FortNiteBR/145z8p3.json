Post nerf sometimes I would just capture the island for slurp and to upgrade other weapons and hide the pulse rifles. \n\nDon't get me wrong, ODM was fun, and Spidey gloves were just a poor man's ODM, but I felt like the chapter was peak when mobility was purple katanas only and the loot pool during that era.\n\nI have mixed feelings about S3 so far. Change is good so it doesn't get stale, but I'm not really loving it from a BR mech/meta aspect. Perhaps it will grow on me.",

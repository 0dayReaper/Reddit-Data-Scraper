I know you can spam it in to oblivion, but it's useful for me and I always try to get it early game. I understand if someone in the comments disagrees with me.",

Throw the boomerang behind a box to either damage a majority of the box, or hit someone inside of the box.\n\n2. ~~Recall/explode the boomerang right after hitting someone to deal a total of 120 damage (Untested by me)~~ Doesn't work",

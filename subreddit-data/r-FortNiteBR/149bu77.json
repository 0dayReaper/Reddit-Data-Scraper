    "postText": "I started playing again after a long hiatus. Before, I was using the repair torch strategy, so my kda was pretty good. But in normal 1v1s, I had about a 1.0 kda. \n\nBut now, I'm averaging about 2.5 kills per game. And I noticed a lot of names seem pretty botty, even though they weren't bot names I was accustomed to before. eg. HotelBlankets or those old names you ran into all the time. Even in the mid-late game I run into people who I'm surprised I can so easily beat before the final 10 humble the crap out of me.\n\nAre there just more bots now? Or did the removal of repair torch and mobility finally get me to learn to aim?",

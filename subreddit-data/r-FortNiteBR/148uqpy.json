    "postText": "So me and a groupd of friends decided to go back to fortnite after several years, typically we played Apex\n\nWe arent the best by any means, but as soon as we got on fortnite we win almost every game, and one friend in particular gets like 20+ kills and over 3000 damage when typically on apex he gets 100+ damage and 1-3 kills\n\nWe are on zero build because we arent skilled enough to compete with the 10 year degree master builders on there\n\nSo I was just wondering of the game is just easy now or has bots, because I remember during first few season after release ot was pretty difficult. Because we just won our third game in a row with almost no difficulty",

This season has been sweatier than the last, so far.  I\u2019m an above average player, but not near the level of the really good ones and I\u2019ve had a tough time making deep into games this season.",

Maybe the data you are referencing only covers builds? Zero builds is filled with bots at all ends of the skill spectrum. This is a reason why people that grind crown wins play this mode.",

You can see them emoting all the time in the lobby and jumping about in pairs in game shooting at each other with terrible aim (while they laser you at a distance). Clean them up and get some wins and the game gets harder. I\u2019m now finding it pretty challenging and I\u2019m playing against some really good actual players now. Also I have a theory if you take a bounty job at a job board you are always hunting a real player. Just a theory.",

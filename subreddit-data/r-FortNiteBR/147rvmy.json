I wanted a Jurassic world collab back in the wild season in chapter 2 when they first introduced raptors and that paddock jungle. \n\nI don\u2019t really know what they could do with skins. I guess they could have Grant, sattler, and Malcom (it would be hilarious to see Hammond popping people off), but everyone knows the real stars of Jurassic park are the Dino. They could do more skins in the style of jonesy rex?  \n\nWhat I would rather see is Dino\u2019s being introduced to the game. We already have raptors. They could add a dilphasouras as a ranged variant. I would love a trex mini boss. Also maybe a brachiosaurus or triceratops that wanders the map like klombo used to and not be hostile unless triggered. A lot of potential for a Dino season.",

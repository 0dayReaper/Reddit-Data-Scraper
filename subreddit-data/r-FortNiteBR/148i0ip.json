I have verified the files, ensured all drivers and software are up to date. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on I\u2019m just playing with no obvious glitches and the screen will just stop showing,or I get the unreal Fortnite crash msg. It\u2019s so random. What\u2019s going on? It has never done this before and weird it\u2019s only happening now as today is my first games playing the new season",

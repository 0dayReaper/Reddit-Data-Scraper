    "postText": "Lots of posts about this recently makes me want to speak up about this.\n\nAs a PC player who *doesn't* play performance mode (wow, I know!) this discourse is silly because it comes down to one thing -  epic's implementation of Performance Mode and how it effects the way terrain renders.\n\nOn the top, Epic settings. Very nice. Could probably be a wallpaper.\n\nOn the bottom, Low settings, **NON PERFORMANCE MODE** (Just directx12). See how the foliage remains identical? Indeed, the sunshine was removed, *but keep in mind that players have an outline that makes them stand out from environmental FX.* There is probably an advantage here, but this is also rather close to the settings that the switch plays at.\n\nWhen you turn on performance mode and literally everything disappears, that is the problem. Epic should change that - but the community should not be attacking us, the PC players, for something out of our control. This issue affects us as well, and should be fixed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Performance mode is broken. Not all PC players are on performance mode. We are not to blame.\n\n[Epic settings](https://preview.redd.it/nqoh2zp10q5b1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5f530eb97acd016d0f59f40a443bf2a996df4589)\n\n[Low settings, non performance mode](https://preview.redd.it/dzliqk290q5b1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=950fff3c8811cf0b3f5227cf045534484fb0c944)",

I have a RTX 2080 with a ~5 year old system - not amazing but certainly more than adequate system specs; it\u2019s super choppy if I don\u2019t scale down the settings significantly. Years ago I used to be able to run it on max settings in 1440p with 100+ fps. Now I need performance mode to prevent the game being a slide show.

Havent tried in the last few season but I was getting dropsdown to 30fps into mega city on performance mode when I can average 160 fps just moving around normally. Would it hurt them to maybe optimize tge game a bit more? Anyone know if higher settings are more stable than performane mode now?",

And in return items don\u2019t render unless you\u2019re super close to them, you\u2019ll just see a weird blob colored the same rarity, so trying to pick a gun while hotdropping is impossible. Epic should be giving us more options with foliage quality not less, ugh",

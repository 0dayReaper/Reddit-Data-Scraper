    "postText": "I don't know about you guys but when they changed it last season it made sense as there was a plethora of movement equipment.  but now that all of that is gone and most of the vehicles in current rotation suck offroad (the excessive number of supercars) but now that the storm moves extremely fast with player count, you're more likely to get killed by zone campers while you're just trying to keep ahead of it since you can't outrun it anymore. in addition that it can just give you an automatic loss with the dynamic final storm circles due to terrain issues and that cannot be planned for since again, movement items are gone. so if it moves to the opposite side of a mountain.   \n\n\nyou just lose.   \n\n\nI feel like I'm playing pubg more than fortnite now with how much running you have to do but you just don't have the stamina to do that.",

Before it wasnt an issue because you could outrun the storm, fight them and you\u2019re fine. Now if you fight back you\u2019re going to make the circle close faster and harder on yourself when you already weren\u2019t outrunning it. \n\nI played a game last night we\u2019re I didn\u2019t even have time to find shields before the circle was closing twice because I happened to land somewhere with 2 teams in trios. I can\u2019t ignore them because I\u2019ll get shot and die. I can\u2019t just leave because I\u2019ll have no loot. Lose lose situation. And if i fight them the zone closes faster and harder\n\nThere is no correct decision\n\nThere is straight up just less incentive to fight and we\u2019re now in the meta where ratting is the ideal which is no fun",

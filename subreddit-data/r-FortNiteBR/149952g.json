    "postText": "On PlayStation, both jump and sprint are bound to L3 when I am riding an animal. It appears that the riding state will use my default jump button (L3) but will not use my default sprint button (X). There is also no way to rebind the riding controls for controller (this is only possible for keyboard).\n\nDoes anyone have a solution for this, other than changing my default bindings?\n\nThis issue has been raised multiple times before (e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/v5f729/animal_ride_controls_unchangeable_on_console/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/v7leex/how_to_change_controls_for_riding_animals/)) without any solution or action by Epic.",

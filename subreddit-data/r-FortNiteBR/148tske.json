The \u2018challenge\u2019 ones suck though. But at least people have been finding loopholes for the annoying ones (e.g. you can spam picking up a gas pump for the collect 500 items one)",

Picking up 500 items or destroying 250 structures can take several matches but 25 eliminations or 25 headshots have been completable in 2-4 matches",

They usually just completed on their own over the course of a season in the past, and even if they stop doing that now, the XP they would give is fairly insignificant to my overall result. I've typically hit lvl 300-400+ every season for years now, so I don't really need whatever they offer.",

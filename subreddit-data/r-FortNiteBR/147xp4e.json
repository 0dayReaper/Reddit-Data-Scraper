There\u2019s just too many sweaty as fuck PC players and dial the graphics way back for an advantage. Honestly, Epic actually needs to do something about it.",

I even tested my gpu via stress test on OCCT thinking it was the issue. No errors. I can also play other games such as re4 and Overwatch 2 just fine.",

Two gliders are essentially reskins and the harvesting tools look more low-effort than the Photonic Striker from the monthly Crew rewards.\n\nI was very disappointed to see that Purradise Meowscles was ruined completely by his mane. It is also disappointing to see an updated version of one of Fortnite's ugliest skins in the battle pass. No one asked for that, and stranger still is that the updated version has a lighter skin tone and the original's skin tone went from olive to dark chocolate.",

It\u2019s very dense and has unique gameplay elements. \n\nI love the lack of mobility. I miss when cars were the best mobility item, and they now are once again. Being able to traverse the map that fast SHOULD be loud and risky. Anyone complaining about mobility probably joined during Chapter 3 just for zero build, and has been spoiled with web slingers, swords, hammers, etc. \n\nThe new (not returning) guns/items are very fun so far. \n\nCons: The drum shotgun and combat smg returning will definitely get old fast. Battle pass is really bad. There\u2019s only 1 skin I\u2019ll ever play as.",

I played so much last season though that I'm taking a break from fortnite for the most part but will play when there's something cool i can unlock for free or when there's new map areas or events to explore.  I always play at least a little here and there throughout every season, even if i don't have the bp. I'm pretty picky with battle passes though and have ever only gotten 3 because of certain characters; Rick Sanchez, Darth Vader, and Eren Jaeger.  I grew up watching Beast Wars and do think Optimus Prime is cool, but not enough to get it.  Oh and i like the new tarzan vine version of the grind rails.  Makes me think of tarzan literally every time i grind on one.  I can hear Phil Collins.(Two Worlds One Family\ud83c\udfb6)",

It's unrewarding and makes the game less tactical and interesting. Zero Build is my jam; the loot pool is imbalanced and play style has never been an issue. When a common Flapjack is actually more efficient than a rare weapon, it's a balance issue.",

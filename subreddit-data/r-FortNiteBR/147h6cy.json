    "postText": "I mainly use the Havoc rifle or the thermal dmr, never the red-eye rifle. Why should I be forced to equip skins for a gun I never use? This has been going on since Ch1 S7, especially with the burst rifle when it would shred, but you never got to see what skin it would have because the Scar was always there. Please, for God's love, let us cycle through every weapon in the game. You could make a little drop-down under every weapon class (and add skins to motorcycles for once). This would be a massive quality of life change cause not all wraps look the same on every gun.",

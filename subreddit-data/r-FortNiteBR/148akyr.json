I don't know why but every weapon i use it feels like they got worse are just to diffuicult to use for example in last season one of my main loadout was the redeye , shot gun, Pistole/SMG and i had no Problems playing them esspacialy the redeye. Now in the new season when i want to use those weapons i suck at least two of them in EVERY f*cking Game! Okay than i just use the new ones when i play them they feel sooo clunky and never hit anything and when i do the enemy always one shots me How can that be?! Pls i need some tips what i can do better, i love Fortnite but like this im close to quitting it again.",

If you're playing controller, the combat smg has no aim assist, so that's one issue you may be encountering. I'm definitely struggling to settle into this season but really like the loot pool, my main issue is making a decision about what to carry. Can't say I have any great wisdom though as I can't say I'm racking up wins \ud83d\ude02",

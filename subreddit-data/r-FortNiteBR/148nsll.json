    "postText": "With Fortnite\u2019s new ultra realistic graphics and jungle clutter, performance mode gets even more advantages and it\u2019s kind of getting to the point of being unfair. You shouldn\u2019t have an entire different looking screen than me making it way easier to see and fight. That\u2019s just an advantage that makes this game feel unfair and if this trend of making Fortnite more realistic rather than keeping its art style continues, performance mode will dominate due to how much easier you can see and shoot enemies with it on.. \n\nI know this will probably be downvoted and hated on but it just doesn\u2019t seem fair to me. I\u2019ve seen the comparisons too so it\u2019s not just them using thermal or something.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI agree that sometimes I\u2019m probably fighting someone that is on an Xbox as well that is just hitting shots through the brush that I think is a player taking advantage of performance mode. But that\u2019s kind of an issue in itself. It makes the game feel frustrating and unfair because you don\u2019t know if the guy fighting you can see that plant you are using as cover or not. It shouldn\u2019t have to feel like a mind game.",

Normally I wouldn't care but the jungle is so cluttered I can't see shit even right in front of me. The amount of visual clarity you get with performance mode is truly disgusting.

            "comment": "Yeah it's really frustrating. And as a controller player, I think they should just remove aim assist from controller   from all games. It's all based on the idea that controller players need help aiming, but I can definitely aim better with a controller than keyboard &amp; mouse. It's always been this way. In my case it most certainly because I didn't switch to PC until like 15 years ago, whereas I've been using controllers since I was 4. Aim assist is the first thing I turn off when a game allows it. They act like it helps you, but having your sensitivity suddenly change without your control is annoying. It makes it harder to hit headshots on running targets because you're trying to keep your the center of your screen right on the player's head and keep it there by moving at the same speed that the player is moving so they you can pull the trigger at the moment when they are lined up perfectly... But your crosshair moves one speed when you're aiming on them and then slows down when you've got the bead on them and are just trying to keep it there. So then the player moves faster than your crosshair will allow you to react because it has entered the bubble of the player's hitbox where it suddenly feels like you're underwater. \n\nBeing in complete control of your crosshair/center of the screen movement is a pretty big part of accuracy, so taking the control of it away from you is frustrating. It makes it so you're always juuuuuust off of where your brain thinks you should be because you were moving faster half a second ago. \n\nI remember there was a game on steam that I was having a lot of fun with (I can't remember the name right now, it actually is a dead game) and I wanted to use a controller so I could be more agile in my movements, but you couldn't turn aim assist off. It had intense aim assist and it was terrible. So I would constantly switch between the two because neither one was comfortable for me to use, and I eventually just quit playing because of the lack of controller customization, mainly the aim assist off having a way to toggle it off. \n\nSometimes it feels like developers also see controller users as less than other gamers, so they either ignore the controller settings, or they turn the controller into a device they they assume you're only using because you don't have the mental or physical capacity to use a keyboard &amp; mouse so they add all kinds of unnecessary crap when they detect you're using a controller. It's like they think using the controller should be the same as bowling with the bumpers up. I don't need you to hold my hand, I don't need other players being at a disadvantage to help me out. I just want an even playing field where I can choose which equipment works for me, even if it's \"harder\" to play with a controller, just let me adapt and overcome. I'm not stupid just because I think a controller is more comfortable to use with my tiny hands, and I can get way better precision when using my thumb than moving my whole wrist or arm.",

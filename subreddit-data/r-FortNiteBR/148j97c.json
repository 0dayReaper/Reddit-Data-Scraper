    "postText": "Well since Optimus isn't getting a cool transformation emote I had an idea.  \nWhat if there was one Semi Truck that looked like Optimus and it had 100 more health and was 2x faster than the regular Semi Trucks and you could attach the Cybertron Canon to it to shoot while you drive? it wouldn't be able to transform and it wouldn't be crazy powerful but I feel like transformer fans deserve just a little more",

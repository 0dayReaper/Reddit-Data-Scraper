    "postText": "This is a bug that's been persistent for since Chapter 3 unfortunately. I love the thermal weapons but it's just so buggy on splitscreen. \n\n#1 Player 2 thermal doesnt work unless player 1 also using a thermal scope at the same time.\n\n#2 If player 1 is using a thermal DMR and player 2 uses any other scoped weapons, player 1s thermal scope/screen will flash and go blank. Rezooming will fix it but it's very distracting.",

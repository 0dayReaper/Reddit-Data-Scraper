    "postText": "Any of y\u2019all ever seen this before. I have been subscribed to Fortnite Crew since September of 2022 and have been receiving the rewards with no hitches every month. This last month I was charged for May but never got the rewards. My epic games account claims I have no subscription, but when I go to try and buy crew in game it acts like I already have it. Additionally when I try to purchase the battle pass I get this message. I have opened up a support ticket and am waiting on a response but I figured I\u2019d ask if anyone has seen this before. Thanks!",

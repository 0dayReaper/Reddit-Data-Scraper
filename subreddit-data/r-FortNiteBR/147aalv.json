After capturing the zone I looked around to discover 3 people in my area, I was playing solos. I looted real quick and started running when one guy starts swimming across the river towards me. I pull out my heavy sniper and miraculously headshot him and kill him. Before I have a chance to breathe, a new opponent appears and starts firing on me with a barrel shotgun at range. Then I see boomerang man jump down with a shot gun to fight them. At this point I consider firing on them both\u2026 but it just feels wrong since boomerang man had done nothing wrong to me. So I just dipped and left the area to boomerang man. I hope he won, but I also didn\u2019t want to be his next target if he did, lol.",

Due to the lack of mobility in this season (yes there is actually a lack of mobilty &amp; no, having more mobility isn't inherently a bad thing like a lot of ppl think), give the boomerang a teleport ability to where ever you throw it. This is more than reasonable &amp; should keep the ppl who don't like \"too much mobility\" from bitching still whilst it should keep ppl like me who like \"too much mobility\" from bitching aswell.

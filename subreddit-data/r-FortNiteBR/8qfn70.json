Had it stuck in my head a few weeks ago and my brother looked it up after he heard me humming it. Since then, at least one of us noticed it at some point during the day every day since. Laser tag, movies, YouTube commercials, Reddit posts about LineRider, other songs, even a few musicals I heard my sister watching. It's everywhere.\n",

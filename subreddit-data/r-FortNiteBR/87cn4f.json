I don't watch his streams regularly but I watch him on YouTube a good bit. He is kind of a hyper dude sometimes but if you watch full games he's not like that all the time or anything. I wouldn't say he has a character that he plays but he definitely has an on stream personality that has helped him get a following. People watch him for two reasons, first he's the best player in the world at the game and secondly his personality and dramatic reactions. ",

I've been watching him for about a month now (ironically, because the reddit circlejerk made me want to see for myself) and very rarely does he really rage, he normally just takes it or even admits when someone else made a really good play on it. He gets salty and annoyed every now and then like anyone else, but he's not a little rage gremlin like every clip posted on reddit would lead one to believe. You should also keep in mind he purposefully overblows his reactions to be entertaining, like in this clip.",

I guess doubling it can make that point moot but out of the shotguns in the game right now, a single Heavy shotgun is the least obnoxious vs the shotguns (assuming single slotted). Tight, reliable when hit (looking at you 7 damage tacs) but not completely unfun because the enemy can't get a huge hit and oneshot you with full shields. ",

The guy's an energetic person, he's passionate, but when you see him using that shit he's almost fucking bored. \n\nThat's my take on it, and the video OP made is hilarious.",

If you are going to have OP shit in the game it better be hard to get.  Thats the benefit of farming up kills in a game is you are going to get two heavy shoutguns.  But with the double pump you could land in pretty obscure places and play it safe the entire game, make it to a top 10 with 1 kill and still have one of the best possible load outs in the game.  ",

I really don't see anything wrong with him occasionally ranting about the double pump. It was broken as fuck, and needed to be nerfed. He went a long time without using it, and only succumbed later on after it seemed like Epic was not going to fix it. By that point, he had been killed by it tens of times. Also, using two heavy shotguns is not the same because it is far more difficult to get two of them than two pumps. Likewise, they do less damage. You can't OHKO from 200 hp with a single heavy shotgun shot, which is how double pumping could quickly down entire squads.\n\nI think Ninja allows himself to go over the top for entertainment value while also speaking his mind. The problem with some of you guys is that you cherry pick a couple minutes of footage out of a weekly 70+ hours of stream to make memes. Is it really surprising that a fraction of a streamer's time would include some freakouts or anger or complaining? We are talking about people living most of their lives on camera in front of  thousands of people. Try to recognize that there is a) a person behind the camera and b) small snippets posted to social media and popular websites do not tell the whole story.",

Nobody that I\u2019ve seen has said it\u2019s the same. And even if he felt it was broken, he\u2019d use it to bring it to the devs attention same as he did with double pump. I\u2019m no Ninja fanboy, but kinda seems like you\u2019re trying to create drama without doing any research. ",

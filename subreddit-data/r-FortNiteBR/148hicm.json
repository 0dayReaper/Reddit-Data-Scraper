    "postText": "I have this mic bug , when i start fortnite and join a party the sound is gone. I cant hear my party and they cant hear me. When i look in the party chat on the right side  is says party channel / game channel and both are not selected at all, and im not able too selecte it as well.  I tried reinstall everything, repair fornite , reset sound settings, select game chanel but still nothing worked for me. Strange thing is i dont have this mic bug on my laptop. This ruins the game for me , because i cant communicate with my team with voice chat. I know there are more people that have the same bug as me , and i hoped some of the people tried something and solved this issue. I know there is a Discord you can use as well for example but a lot of my friends play on console so that is not a option.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ",

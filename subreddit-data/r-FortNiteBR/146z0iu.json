I liked everything about the game except the building aspect. Soon as ZB was introduced? It was a done deal. All the older gamers who\u2019ve been playing shooters for 15+ years are just looking for a slightly different take on a third-person shooter game which is why we flock to ZB, while the kids stick to regular mode.",

Therefore a byproduct is a game that keeps is players interested, but at the same time can frustrate different groups of players depending on their needs/wants in the game over time. If we didn't have change, we'd probably have a stale community that complains about the lack of change (which we have also had).\n\nWith regards to transportation, the game has always swayed from having lots to not having much. Just because the game had lots of transportation added, doesn't mean it needs to stick around. I actually welcome the fact that players can't traverse the map in a short space of time continually. I remember when the only form of transport was floor rifts or a rift to go that you could only use once.",

Coming from Overwatch, people here may not know how it FEELS to be truly betrayed, eviscerated, by the creators of the game you love so much, right after they left you unanswered for years, with a few hopes and dreams to survive off.  \nSo I thought at first that the Fortnite community were cry-babies, something along the lines of \"You guys don't even know what it's like to play a bad game\".  \nWas it true? Fuck no! I realised that complaining about a game is normal and necessary to keep developers at bay, so they don't try anything funky, or correct it when they do it.  \n\n\nSo keep complaining, it's good for the game.",

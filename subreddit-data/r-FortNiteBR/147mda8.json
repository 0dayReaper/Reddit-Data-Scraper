    "postText": "Concerning the comp and content creation scene, as a person that has been a player  since Jan 2018, I believe that the games downfall has nothing to do with the game itself. Fortnites all time high viewership was when people were concentrated on fast-paced gameplay and when high kills was the content creators\u2019 and pros main goal. It wasnt as focused on victory as much as it was to a show of skill. We had household names that we were rooting for even during their lucky pub encounters (eg. Tfue vs Ninja).Now concerning viewership in comp all time high was the world cup. Where the need to win and to have a good show were equal with each other. Household names were present but there was also room for new names to rise. The box meta was existent but not to the extent that every endgame was the same thing with different players each time. There was room for innovation in gameplay and strategy. However nowadays, there are hardly any known pros left representing in media and any attempt to leave your box in endgame without doing a standard third or fourth party is almost certainly getting you killed(in competitive matches and tournaments). There is no spectacle to witness anymore. Its all the same boring story regardless of seasons or items. The problem with the game isnt the game. Its its players. Fortnite is a game still trying to hold on to casual gameplay, while its BR players are clearly way past that. A casually designed game paired with a competitive community is possibly the worst possible combination in the gaming industry. It leaves the devs clueless and the players frustrated. There is no spark anymore. We dont even know who the best players are. Chances are that the best player rn is a 14 yo that nobody knows because he doesnt provide anything special to the scene. He is just better at doing the same things as everybody does. Every match feels like a repetition of the last since you continuously face the same opponent with a different nametag. The skill progression has reached a stalemate that epic does nothing to reset. They give us \u201cnew\u201d locations and \u201cnew\u201d weapons when what we need is something gamechanging in the mechanics aspect. And perks and sliding and mantling wont make the cut.

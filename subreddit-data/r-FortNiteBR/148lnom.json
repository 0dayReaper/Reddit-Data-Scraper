Right now, long distance gunfights are becoming fairly drawn out. It'd be nice to see one of the mobility items come back.",

I definitely agree it was frustrating to no end when you get some so close and they whiz away. Of course i did it a lot myself too lol. I would play methodically with more time in the day but otherwise want as much action per game as i can get. But im a fairly new player and can respect the consensus that removing them stays truer to fortnites roots.",

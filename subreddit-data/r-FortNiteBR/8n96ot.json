Only difference is I was wondering why the heck those guys are still here and not going to tilted because that's where the circle was. I decided 'fk it, I'm going' so me and 2 others were in tilted. Next thing I knew, I went from 19 members to 3 of us left. I was like 'you gotta be fucking kidding me...' I just see a bunch of cross signs on the map and laughed so hard and then died to someone above the clock tower. Then, a similar situation happened again next 2 games later, this time from Greasy Grove to Shifty. 20v20 is just everyone messing around and so I just joined in on the fun.",

So you can kinda use it to move faster across the map depending on where you're at. We survived the storm earlier because of it, made it out with 2hp to spare because of the downhill speed. \n\nHonestly, I can't tell how good it is yet but it's a hell of a lot of fun. I got into a cart battle with another duo earlier and it was hilarious. Me and my friend have made it a mission to win games using the cart all game, we've pulled it off a few times.\n\nThe guy in the passenger seat can build/shoot so you can provide cover for your buddy while he pushes. So far, it's pretty useful because of the surprise factor. Nobody expects you to come flying downhill at them REALLY fast while spraying a scar.\n\nMy next thing is gonna be to build a skybase and then rotate my ramps backwards so I can roll alllll the way down.

    "postText": "After the new season released I cant log in to the Fortnite. Sometimes it just logs in after a considerable time but it is so laggy that my friends in the lobby cant see that I become ready. I tried to change to my mobile internet and everything seemed fine. I logged in to the game very fast. I tried almost everything like port forwarding or reset the settings but it did not work. I am waiting a response from Epic. Anyone here experiencing same issue ? Thanks.",

Download a free program called CCleaner - run it and clean up your pc. Check what startup and background apps are running and turn off everything unnecessary. Make sure the game is running on directx11 and not 12.",

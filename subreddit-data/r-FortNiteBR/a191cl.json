Obviously I get the joke but the random capitalizations would look pretty dumb, especially if someone were being considered for a higher level position. As someone who understands the reference I would honestly facepalm at something like this, but it\u2019s not like I wouldn\u2019t hire someone because of a joke. \n\nAlso, some simple cross checking would show that the two people have never lived in the same market or worked for the same company. They\u2019re possibly not even in the same industry but I have no clue. There are people out there who try to stuff their reviews and it\u2019s usually pretty obvious so this would probably be written off if someone was digging. \n\nThat being said it really depends on the company, some companies are anal about stuff like this some not so much. If a company wants to actually check references they\u2019ll ask for them, not rely on something written on a LinkedIn profile. ",

It's not Facebook or Reddit where you just make a dumb joke for some easy karma - some people actually try to use LinkedIn to screen qualifications.\n\nMaybe you've never worked in recruiting before, but I have.  You may think that 1 fake review wont tank someone, but I can tell you from experience it does.  You think he's the only person in the world looking for a job?  Hell no.  But the other 100 applicants dont have a review  from someone that only knew them for two weeks, could not give any specifics on how they helped the team up, and which seems to be littered with random capitalization errors.\n\nThe review wont atop him from getting hired when his foot is in the door.  But it will stop that door from opening when the hiring managers sees that no one else needed a made up review on their profile.\n\nI appreciate trying to put out your opinion that you dont think something like this could hurt; but that's the problem.  People are so caught up with thinking their opinion is 100% correct that they turn it to fact when they haven't actually thought it through. \n\nPS.  ITS HIS ONLY REVIEW.  You dont think a made up review as the only one will raise a red flag?  Jesus dude.",

It also might interest you to know plenty of people have LinkedIn and don't use it for those purposes and don't really care about it. Not everyone is networking up selective career ladders. If this guy cared, no fucking shit he wouldn't leave it on his profile. And by the way, no one is forcing or even recommending those of you who do care to do anything like this.\n\nThis post is an obvious joke, everyone preaching about how LinkedIn is some sacred serious thing is so fucking lame.

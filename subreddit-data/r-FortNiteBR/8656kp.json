It looked 3d, but you and all the enemies were always on the same level - you could only aim left and right, not up and down.  Doom added ramps/stairs so you could be on a different level as enemies, but the vertical part of aiming was still automatic - you could only move your cursor left and right, and as long as your shot was lined up on the horizontal axis, the bullet would go to the right height.   Then Quake added \"true\" 3d aiming.  If you were a rich kid who had a sweet computer.  which i wasn't :(",

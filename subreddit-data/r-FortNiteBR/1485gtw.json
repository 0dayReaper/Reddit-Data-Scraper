    "postText": "I doubt anyone knows anything about this, but I'm asking just for some hope in case someone does. Recently, I was supposedly banned (without knowledge of the ban), and this error popped up when I tried to go into creative:\n\n\"You were removed from the match due to your IP, VPN, machine, or cheating.\"\n\nBut I wasn't and still am not cheating, so obviously I was confused but then a day later I was unbanned, so today, like I did the last time, Fortnite wasn't opening so I deleted some files that a tutorial I watched on YouTube said would fix the issue, and it did fix the issue, except I got banned, they were in the EasyAntiCheat folder under certificates, I deleted every file in that folder, there was only 3 but still, I probably should have thought more about deleting EasyAntiCheat files than I did but still, I just now correlated me deleting the files and me getting banned at the same time, so my question is, is there a possibility I could have been falsely banned or cheating get falsely detected for deleting those files? Again, I doubt anyone knows much, if anything, about this topic, but I'm just reaching for a prayer here, or however the saying goes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n (Also, I apologize if I used the wrong flair.)",

The ban-message you got clearly stated MULTIPLE POSSIBLE REASONS why you were removed from the game, so going \"but I wasn't cheating\" doesn't exclude the rest. Nor is \"I wasn't cheating\" ever something anyone believes because guess who claims that the most and loudest? Cheaters.\n\nThird: The game wouldn't allow you to even play without a working EAC.",

I know that cheaters are the ones who say that they aren't cheating the most, but I don't really know how else to prove or say that I'm not cheating. I know that most other people don't believe me, but still. I don't think the ban is permanent just because of yesterday; it might be, and if it is, assuming it's an IP ban, then I guess I'll move to Germany and buy a new PC.",

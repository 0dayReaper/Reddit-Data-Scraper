    "postText": "They went from the fastest season ever to one of the slowest, and not just for the mobility: they nerfed the pistol, vaulted the red eyes and every new weapons it feels slow. And it\u2019s a real shame, because the map and the battle pass are great. \n\nI hope they add some \u201cpotable mobility\u201d to make the game faster, something that matches with the season like the hammer or the katana. Maybe the grappler could be an option, even if they nerf it.",

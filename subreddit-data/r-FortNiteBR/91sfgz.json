Once you figured out how to play Thanos, you'd murk entire lobbies since your shield amount would refresh on kill.\n\n* 700 Health\n* 300 Shield that refreshed on kills\n* Beam that hit for 15dmg every tick\n* Fly across the map after about a second to gather himself\n* Smash AOE into the ground and destroyed builds like C4\n* Punches hit for 100.\n* Punches destroyed builds instantly.\n\n\nHe was overtuned. And it fit because he was Thanos.\n\nAnd then Fortnite didn't want anyone's feelings hurt by not playing as Thanos, so they made Thanos easier to kill. Everyone got to play as Thanos.\n\nAnd eventually, Thanos was bait for easy kills, whether the enemy captured the gauntlet or not.\n\n",

To lower bloom a player needs to stand still or crouch. Tap firing automatic weapons allows the size of the cone of fire time to reset between bullets.\n\n&gt;Bloom applies to the following weapons : Sub machine gun (SMG), Assault SMG, Silenced SMG, Automatic Pistol, Silences Pistol, Revolver, Assault Rifle (AR), Burst Assault Rifle, Scoped Assault Rifle. The scoped AR is a stand out because its bloom is not messaged with the crosshair while zoomed, however it does seem to offer less bloom than the other weapons while not being 100% accurate.\n\n&gt;In Fortnite BR the inside of the crosshair arms denote \u201cbloom\u201d \u2013 the circle where bullets can land. This changes with movement, crouching, shooting. The usual suspects that lower weapon inaccuracy in FPS. In order to hit 100% this circle needs to cover the target 100%. The centerpoint of the crosshair is meaningless for the AR/bloom weapons. Bullets do not appear to favor the center more than outside parts of the bloom circle. A better way to describe this might be the cone of fire \u2013 however the fortnite BR community seem to have attached the term bloom to everything related to weapon inaccuracy.\n\n&gt;Technically \u201cbloom\u201d is the aim area shrinking or expanding based on player behavior. Bloom simulates recoil in Fortnite, however beyond controlling the size of the shooting area (minimise bloom) players cannot control the recoil like in CounterStrike and similar games. \n",

But, epic pumps out updates practically every day to improve their game, and they have always done a good job imo (even if they make some mistakes like trap damage and p90 as shown).",

Complaints about how long it takes for them to change something because multiple updates come to the community but not even a full week has passed. It's been one single full day and people are wondering how they haven't made any changes? That's crazy lol\n\nIt would be stupid for them to respond to the criticisms so prematurely because anything posted on here will be taken as an official statement and run away with",

He smile and told me: \u201cwell, I guess i\u2019ll win this game.\u201d\n\nHe then proceeded to win the game with 12 kills with that SMG. He\u2019s an great player overall, but the SMG makes it even easier, since you don\u2019t even need to aim properly.\n\nI don\u2019t know, man; we\u2019ve been playing since pre-season 1, and this new SMG is the dumbest and lamest thing ever. \n\nI am really uncomfortable with the direction the game is going in the last updates. \n\n",

In this instance, the one on the back wall, and the torch on the far left are the torches that match.(The torches are the same, but the rooms are backwards! Since the one torch was on the far eight, it is now far left) The statues truly are a guessing game I believe, but the flames just have to be extinguished to match that first flame room we found.\n\nHope that helps!",

    "postText": "So I have 4 kids, 3 Nintendo switches, and a PS4. Kids 1, 2, and 3 all play Fortnite, all have their own Nintendo Switch accounts. TLDR: I want the account with all the gear (on the playstation) to also appear on the Nintendo Switch, which was previously logged into another Epic Account.\n\nDetails:\n\n\\- Kid 2 has been using my Playstation account to buy all his stuff on Fortnite on the PS4.\n\n\\- Kid 2's Nintendo Fortnite account is somehow logged into MY Epic Games account. His username is my name.\n\n\\- I have linked the PS account with all the gear to HIS Epic Games account.\n\nNintendo tells me this: \"**Important:** It is only possible to link one Nintendo Account to an Epic Games account. After linking your Nintendo Account to your Epic Games account, it will not be possible to switch the Nintendo Account linked even if you unlink the accounts.\"\n\nI want the gear from the PS4 account to show up on the Nintendo Account. I'm fine to \"give\" him my PS4 account AND my Epic Games Account by switching names and avatars and such, so long as I don't have to repurchase all this gear. The Nintendo accounts, on the other hand, are linked to progress on MANY other games and cannot change.\n\nCan I get the gear to show up on the Switch by logging into his Epic Games account, unlinking the PS account with the gear, then linking the PS account to my Epic Games account (which is tied to HIS Nintendo Account somehow)? Then I can switch the names and avatars and email addresses, and it's like it was him all along?\n\nIf not, is there some other way I'm not thinking of? If we have to start fresh somehow, is there a way to get his Switch and his PS4 on the same EG account?",

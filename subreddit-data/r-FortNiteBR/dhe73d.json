For every other event, 10 minutes was kind of the sweet spot, but I guess not here.  It was pretty disappointing, but I feel even worse for people who didn't get to see any of it.  \n\nThen the black hole thing...after 10 minutes I got on youtube to see if that's what was happening, I was sure it was my internet again lol.",

You cannot forget that there are many people within the coorporation, who makes the coorporation possible (Thus the game possible). I mean. I'm sure their marketing team is pretty strong, since the game exploded so quickly. And that is just one example.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, I reckon it is much easier to deal with specific salaries, and from a developers standpoint, it's nice to be secure about your salary. If one month Fortnite doesn't make that much money, then the developers will suffer from it otherwise.",

Now if he were to pitch an entirely original skin concept and it were to be put in the game then they could sue, but they would still have a tough time winning.

I'm just glad epic actually look at the work people create and add it to the game, I think it's super cool and hope they do more, some of the skin ideas I've seen on here are sick and I would buy them in a second if they got released",

Detect enemies from the canopies with the \u201cThermal DMR,\u201d skate on vines firing the \u201cFlapjack Rifle,\u201d and turn opponents into spectators with the \u201cCybertron Cannon.\u201d\n\nRead all of the details over at [fn.gg/WILDS](https://fn.gg/WILDS)",

There is so much space and way to move around too (vine grinding, jumpin on the top of the trees etc). Love it.\n\nThe ruins vault mechanic (enter with a correct rarity weapon + flame puzzle) is also a very nice touch didn't expect that. Now I feel sad for all the people who missed out on Indiana Jones and Lara Croft.\n\nIf there will be a mini battlepass again (like the Star Wars last season)... oh boy please Jurassic Park.",

Everyone applauded the removal of the ability of the mythic pump to 1HK in ZB, but every time someone mentions the sniper should get the same nerf they get downvoted to oblivion.\n\nEvery other AAA BR either never had or removed 1hk snipers but the fortnite community built different ig. \n\nI\u2019ve been 1 shot headshotted by a player with a heavy sniper before then spectated him miss 3 straight shots on the slabs vault boss. Too much luck involved. I thought we were we against items that close the skill gap",

New Augments are pretty mid and I find myself missing the augments I didn't even really like after they have been watered down by the new ones. And of course, rest in peace to the Combat Shotgun. I hate to have only complaints but there isn't much that I like about the new season.

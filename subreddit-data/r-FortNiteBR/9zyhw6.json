At one point there was a giant building sized purple cube that you could bounce off of traveling slowly around the map leaving imprints on that ground that made those areas low gravity zones. The community ended up naming the cube \"Kevin\" which eventually fell into loot lake, melted and made the entire lake a bounce pad. And thats not even scratching the surface of things that have happened. Do a little research on this whole cube/Kevin event because there's a lot more to it that's even crazier. It's pure madness almost every week now. For Halloween there were zombies all over the map. Can't say they aren't keeping things fresh though. It's actually pretty cool.",

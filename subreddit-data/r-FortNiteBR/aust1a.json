Every now and then you end up with a player that is more concerned with having fun than their KD ratio. Had a super fun interaction with a John Wick recently. We both went for the same shotgun after dropping and when I got it first he just crouched and looked at the ground. I gave up the shotgun and did the same thing, he refused to kill me. We ended up just dancing back and forth until eventually he threw a couple clingers at me and stuck next to me so we'd die together. I really wish Epic had a messaging service of sorts so I could PM them confessing my love the way I would have when I was playing on Xbox",

Full story: After giving him the gun and dancing for a bit I tried to go separate ways (we both landed at shipping containers). I get to the otherside of shipping containers and LOW AND BEHOLD I SEE A JOHN WICK. I start emoting again to show I'm still harmless and the guy starts shooting at me. I ended up winning the fight but my heart was broken in the process. Next thing, I hear some emoting behind me. TURNS OUT I SHOT A DIFFERENT JOHN WICK, WHAT ARE THE ODDS. We chill for a bit, both dropping our guns. Meanwhile John Wick #2 is still spectating me and I highly doubt he saw the original interaction. I really didn't wan't to get in trouble for teaming in a solo so I kept doing the crying emote and facing the ground, hoping my buddy John 1 would get the hint and take me out. That's when my boy ran up to me, tossed some clingers and took us both out in a beautiful blaze of glory. It's a pretty long interaction but I did save the replay so maybe with some editing it could be reddit worthy. That one 2 minute game was honestly the most fun I've ever had playing Fortnite. Shoutout to JW1 for making my night",

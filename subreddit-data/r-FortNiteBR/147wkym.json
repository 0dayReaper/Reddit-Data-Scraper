The hammer is definitely my second, never felt as powerful as I did then when I wielded that thing. My mid-range would probably be the explosive rifle or the thermal DMR because let's be honest I am blind and could use the assistance with seeing players. Then I am really not sure, likely some healing because that is never a bad idea. I also am typically the one carrying the team's healing or slurp cannon to run as team medic, so that is a relatively likely situation to play out.",

Nintendo also sells Switches in China through Tencent and Tencent makes sure everything sold in china censored.   \nCan't really blame them if they want to extend their business to China, unless they push chinese censoreship onto everyone else. That shit can stay in china and if they make china-only clients where the censoreship happens, I don't mind.   \nThe opposite would be something like Ubisoft did in Rainbow six where they removed blood and casino objects in a map because of China and this censorship affected everyone globally. That is bullshit.",

The storefront situation is in such a bad state that anything that isn't familiar (aka Steam) will be absolutely ignored unless there are some exclusives attached to it.

Generally, I'll often side with Jim Sterling's arguments, but his argument for the Epic store doesn't apply to its situation.",

We contained the USSR in large part because we, the West, did not do a lot of business with them. By making business routine with China we gave them all carrot and no stick in regards to improving the treatment of all people, protecting human rights, labor rights, and the environment. It's been a fucking disaster and we need to start putting our foot down before they decide to take Taiwan and murder all of them. Or start taking down even more of the world.

These items were all awesome, but you\u2019re instantly disadvantaged for not having it, so you basically have 4 inventory slots to play around with. Having the map facilitate movement through grind rails, hot air balloons, airflow, ziplines, grind rails, etc allows every player to have equal footing with mobility.

Guy sprays open one side of the box, I return fire, and hit more of my shots than he managed to hit his. 1 Win, 6 kills, and I could not stop shaking afterwards lol.\n\nFlash forward to now, with several hundred wins, and I only wish the Chapter 1 Scar was in the game lol.",

It's amazing to see how much progress and improvement you've made since then, accumulating several hundred wins. It's natural to have a preference for certain weapons, and the Chapter 1 Scar was definitely a fan-favorite.",

The map was perfect, the battle pass was iconic, the gun selection was great, the game was really starting to take off popularity wise, it felt so new and fresh. There were no bots back then, so Victory Royale\u2019s were actually hard to get and still meant something. I still remember coming home after a long day at school and jumping on duos or squads with the boys. Or going to my friends house after school and taking turns trying to get a solo win. C1S3 was easily the peak of my enjoyment of the game, I was playing every day and night and got to tier/level 100 so fast.\n\nI miss 2018 so much. Life was so much better.",

Thinking back to that season I remember rotating from Lucky up into the farm, or going over to Lil Mexico in the desert or into the snow. It seemed like that first map had lasted forever and would last forever. I remember the day before that old map went away I spent some time up on that floating island, just looking down at Lucky Landing, not really believing that it would be gone tomorrow, but trying to sear it into my memory in case it was. Guess it worked, because I still remember.",

I was at my cousins house on day one of fortnite and was watching him play, I had a few games on it to want to download it later that same day but only played like 3 games for this season and like 7 total, I enjoyed those 2 games of season 2, season 3 dropped and my friends had just downloaded the game and that\u2019s when I started to play seriously, so technically, I played at least one game since season 0 to chapter 4 season 3, I bought every battle pass up until chapter 3 season 1, and I have used every single gun since, I was lucky enough to watch my cousin use the Zapatron, he gave me the controller and I am proud to say I am one of a very few to ever use the Zapatron,",

Thought it looked fun, and I think the game was the best when people didn't know how to build fast and only built forts and such. No build is fun but building IS the defining fortnite feature, but the hyper building is beyond obnoxious. \n\nWish there was a mode where you could build but on a cooldown. The concept of making your own cover but not outright building onto someone is what is appealing to me",

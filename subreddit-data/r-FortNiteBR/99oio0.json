If my memory serves correctly, there was very little camera manipulation in those Harry potter games. \n\nIt takes a lot of practice getting your hands to do two different tasks simultaneously without thinking about it and continuing on to the next task. Add in the stress of knowing there are 99 other people trying to kill you? Just adds to the disconnect. That seems to be the biggest problem with new gamers and why they always seem to be looking at the ground or at the sky. They have to think about what they're doing with one hand, which leads the other to just wander.",

Growing up, the extent of my shooter game experience was repeatedly dying in COD back in day and barely touching it (it was my brother\u2019s game). I only just found out a couple of weeks ago that shot guns do more damage close range. Apparently this is basic knowledge!",

Later played Counter Strike 1.6 and it went so much smoother. The quality of the mouse itself can also be a huge factor, with some of them having really imprecise sensors.          \nBack to the point; Older games often were console ports plagued with mouse acceleration that just took away everything that makes the mouse intuitive but fortunately that is almost unseen nowadays.",

I had to use it since my old mouse suddenly stopped working and that was the only thing around.   \n\n\nIt did some really weird stuff, like whenever I moved my mouse really fast the sensor wouldn't pick up anything and just turn reeeeaaaaly slowly. And if you manage to move it just the right speed you could get your camera to turn for about 2 seconds longer than the movement you did with the mouse itself (if that makes any sense).   \n\n\nGaming mice don't have to be expensive but it needs a half decent sensor at least, that's able to pick up faster movements as well without buggin out completely ",

It's hard to jump into modern games of any genre without any prior experience and most folks who play games all the time have played so long they don't remember what it was like to be a scrub.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into the stuff that folks just intrinsically know from playing prior games that modern games don't often explain. Stuff like sprinting, stamina systems, or, as you alluded to, the fact that shotguns fire in like a 'cone' in video games and are more effective in close range.\n\nMy wife started playing a couple of years ago and I couldn't stand to look at the screen while she learned how to work the camera. I had to make myself busy to not get nauseous but I also didn't want to leave in case she bumped up against something the game expected you to know but didn't teach.\n\nShe's a full blooded bad ass on video games now though. Just like anything else, no one starts off good, it's something that has to be practiced and nurtured.",

I'm too old to be great anymore, but the controls and world awareness is second nature to me.  \n\nI also get great joy out of encouraging the people just learning or just trying out games for the first time or this game for the first time.  With new or less skilled gamers particularly if you praise them when it gets messy they are more likely to keep playing and more likely to get aggressive and push next time.\n\nNext time instead of \"what the hell pull out the shotgun\" try \"hey you lived longer than me and that guy was tough, good job getting some shots on him, ready for another round?\"\n\nAs experienced gamers we know what \"just press A\" or \"just smash square\" or \"press e then r double tap x OMG hit your crouch button\" means.. But for someone that wasn't born and bread on this remembering which button is crouch etc is hard, and when someone gets uppity about it it just makes them want to put the controller device down and go read a book or talk with their friends that GET them.  Try and remember the excitement and fun when you learned how to use the single red button and joystick on your Atari... they can have the same but instead of one stick and one button you give them a super mouse with 8 buttons and a 152 key keyboard.... \n\nEvery person that i've played with more than a few games of fortnite has gotten quite a bit better over their months of play.  Help make the game fun for those people you'd like to play with and let them learn at their own pace and don't try and jamb 30+ years of gaming knowlege down their throat in one session.  Day one \"point at the enemy and pull the trigger\" day two \"lower the sensitivity so its easier to point right in close battles\" day three \"build a ramp for protection\" day four \"when it gets close bust out a shotty\"  etc etc. \n\nAlso... take the new players into playground for 10 minutes so YOU are not stressing over kills and such, and show them how to harvest where chests often are hidden, basics of a 4x4 and let them practice shooting you (on the same team so you don't keep re-spawning) explain the hit-marks, explain the red x showing they will hit an obstacle in the way etc etc.\n\nIf they want to play they will get much better in just a few weeks if we remember to make the game fun and enjoyable and make them feel included and not outcasted by our inability to remember what its like to have no clue how to even control an imaginary thing on screen.\n\n",

We are suposed to play Fortnite or making role movies cosplays ?\n\nThis attitude make us looks like spoiled brats, this is why above us they speak about kids.\nHave nothing to do with \"kids hate\", it's just that any grown up can understand this is a technical problem nothing more and just move on.",

Probably it was specifically made for an Optimus Prime 3D character.\n\nEpic's animation rigs for Fortnite playable characters all share the same structure and bone/joint hierarchy. It's the only way they can use the same animation (be it locomotion, an emote etc) on all characters. It's also the reason why you have characters like The Hulk have small hands - so they can  have hand animations like grabbing, shooting etc that work the same way as the other characters (Midas, Fishstick, Spiderman etc). So, if the base animation skeleton of the Fortnite characters does not allow a manipulation like this, then it won't work... Even if it uses an Optimus Prime 3D mesh on top of it.",

You can have a competitive advantage in casual modes and having the head not visible is a competitive advantage and fortnite has always said that they don't do that and everytime they've done it before it's been fixed\n\nAlso oh no you said my username wow what an insult, honestly get a a fucking life",

Plus, they pretty much hid their head so you have no solid way of dealing extra damage to them despite them still being able to headshot you. You enter the bathroom, and suddenly, after realizing the player you just spent the past 5 minutes chasing turned into a fucking truck the size of a Creepin Cardboard, they get the jump on you, and headshot you with a pump shotgun, destroying your HP. Does that sound fair to you?",

Who is consistently hitting head shots. If this emote was a traversal, it would be going that slow and would take a few seconds to transfer back that you would already have a huge advantage to cause damage even without the head showing. There could be an autobot logo projected - similar to the back bling - that could hover where the hit box would be if you are really that bothered. \n\n3) make the emote a victory royale emote only, such as Doctor Doom",

So why wouldn\u2019t epic just do a simple emote of the transformers transforming??? It\u2019s easier to make a transformer transform as an emote rather then put Ironmouse or froot in a game. All of the vshojo girls (and ex) have very detailed models. Epic is very confusing sometimes",

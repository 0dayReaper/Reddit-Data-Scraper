    "postText": "I fill like every season I have played ( started really playing CH3 SE3) I get extremely nervous about if the styles are really going to be worth it. I know lots of people look forward to them but does anyone actually use it? CH3 SE was really bad but how often does that happen (thankfully last 2 have been good) cus find myself really worrying if there good or not every season.",

There's no use spending your time worrying about something that you can't change. In the meantime, try to think about the possibilities with the theme:  Mud! Leaves! Petrified zero point!",

            "comment": "Super Styles have always been a mixed bag in my opinion. Sometimes they are very dull (full skin 1 color without any kind of accents for example), some have been outright atrocious (weird color choices, a very busy looking effect on the skin, ....), and some have been pretty good (usually the ones that only change aspects of the skin, like clothing + hair, where it's more like the character got a new set of clothing, instead of getting dumped into a vat of gold).\n\nUntil either Epic unveils the super skins (or someone finds infos on them hidden in the files) we can't do anything but wait.\n\nAs for actual usage of the skins - I only very rarely see super styles in action. I personally only use them when it's fitting for a set I'm making (for example, If I'm making a Cube-based Set I might grab a super-style that has a fitting, purple color, or some kind of rune-based superstyle.)\n\nYou shouldn't really get worked up about them though. They are just a little bonus for when you get over level 100, there's no necessity to actually get them, much less when you're not going to use them. And even if they do look good, chances are that you're still not going to use them all that often simply because there's such a huge variety of other skins and styles available.",

            "comment": "As someone who hit 200 the last 8 seasons, it's never really \"worth\" it if you are only playing for the sake of grinding them out and not the fun of the game. I use them, but only on skins I would already use without them, if that makes sense to you. Occasionally they can combo with the set gear or some other stuff you have to look decent. For example, I loved every skin from MEGA that got the styles and I was able to find a good loadout I liked for at least one super style per character, so I felt last season's super styles were worth it for my fashion options.",

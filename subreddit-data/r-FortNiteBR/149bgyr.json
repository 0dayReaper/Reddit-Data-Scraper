The classic locations themselves are slightly worse versions of their initial iterations, and serve little purpose other than nostalgia bait(looking at you, tilted). What few landmarks there are, mostly, are boring, character-deficient, and uninteresting to travel through and loot. \n\nThe season-specific map changes did little to the map other than remove quite a few of the actually interesting locations(looking at you Camp Cuddle, looking at you Wind Breakers). The map elevation feels severely neutered and poorly distributed. Location placements feel clumsy and muddled overall.\n\nDue to the heavy presence and influence of the Seven, the map also doesn't feel like its own separate entity. Rather, it feels like a storybook landscape, a set piece used to further the narrative, and as a result, it makes everything feel cheap and expendable, and deprives the map of any charm, character, and soul, that it otherwise might have.\n\nIn short, it was a bland, tasteless, clumsy, muddled mess of a map that made the game a chore to play, and I audibly cheered during the end of season event, when I saw it get blown the fuck up by the Herald.\n\nAlso, the Daily Bugle far overstayed its welcome.",

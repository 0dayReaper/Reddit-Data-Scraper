LMG is not one, as LMGs are seen as Assault Rifles for weapon classificiation of the game.\n\nThe game got Pistol, SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Marksman, Sniper Rifle, Heavy. With Marksman and Sniper Rifle sharing wraps. And the Flapjack is affected by everything Assault Rifle related, making it by game mechanic classification an Assault Rifle. Not an Sub-Machine-Gun.",

There is even dedicated killfeed lines for the timber trees - and I doubt you want to argue that THEY are somehow weapons, too.\n\nBut for anything actually gameplay related: weapon categories we only got the ones I listed:\n\n1. Pistol\n2. SMG\n3. Assault Rifle\n4. Shotgun\n5. Marksman (only one not existing in STW)\n6. Sniper Rifle\n7. Heavy\n\nThere is no LMG category at all. Meaning any LMG needs to be put into one of the above seven (or six, in STW) categories. Which is by default \"Assault Rifle\". And that applies to the Flapjack, too: As far as the game is concerned, it's an Assault Rifle and treats it as such.\n\nWhich brings us back to the issue of the OP: Why is the Flapjack, a weapon the game clearly considers an Assault Rifle, sold in an SMG vending machine? Because it's a bug that it's offered there. Simple as that. And I don't see how there is much need to discuss here.",

If, for example, it wants to say that someone got scewered by a particular bow, but set ablaze by a different bow even if both killed via a direct hit, Epic can do that.\n\nIt's as simple as adding \"if killed by weapon X, display line \"player%1 murdered player%2 in a hilarious way\" as part of the weapon coding. It's just a string of text.\n\nIt's a feature Epic used even way back in UT2004, where the Lightning Gun and the Sniper Rifles were both the same type of weapon (Sniper, go figure!), but had two different kill messages simply because Epic wanted them to have two different ones, not a generic \"got sniped\" one only done by sniper rifles in general.",

Offers two Shotgun-classed weapons plus shells&amp;slugs ammo. Uses a showman look for Llana.\n5. Marksman Vending machine. Offers two Marksman-classed weapons plus Medium ammo. Formerly offeres Sniper Rifles and Heavy Ammo. Uses an eyepatch look for Llana.\n6. Bow Vending machines (not currently in use). Offers two Bow-classed weapons plus arrow ammo. Uses an eyepatch look for Llana.\n7. Mending Machine. Offers two healing items plus a insta-heal-option. Uses a hearts look for Llana\n8. Broken Vending Machine. Offers a complete random item from a dedicated pool (up and including live chicken sometimes). Uses a red screen instead of Llana.\n\nAdditionally, all Vending machines have conversation lines specifically tied to what they are offering for various interactions: Inspecting, buying, cancelling, damage, critical damage, select emotes.\n\nThis is how Vending machines have worked since Chapter 2 Season 8, which is now close to TWO years.\n\nHowever, there is not a \"generic vending machine\" like you claim. Look it up on the Wiki.\n\nSo, yes, the Flapjack being offered in an SMG vending machine is a very blatant and obvious bug to anyone who knows how vending machines work.",

I could write some blatant bullshit on there and it would get added.. the fact that you can't understand his choice is over the LMG and the character is talking specifically about a sub... which is DIRECTLY NEXT TO THE LMG..",

Which are currently correctly listed on the Wiki, which also lists EVERY DIFFERENT vending machine individually, along with categorizing the various dialog lines for the respective vending machines, and even what situation they're said.\n\nWhich is like that for, again, nearly two years.\n\nBut hey, if you can prove that you're right, please go and find a vending machine that offers two different categories of weapons but only talks about one of them, that isn't the SMG vending machine offering the Flapjack.\n\nFor example, a vending machine that talks about offering you a shotgun, using the shotgun-selling Llana (showman with a bowler hat and bowtie) yet offering ANYTHING that isn't a shotgun.\n\nI'll wait.\n\nBecause if you would be right, then you could find that. Easily. With no issues.\n\nI have backed up my claim with explaining it in detail and mentioning the Wiki as visual and readable confirmation where everything is listed exactly as I stated, on TWO different pages (one for the vending machine itself, one for Llana specifically).\n\nYOU have not.",

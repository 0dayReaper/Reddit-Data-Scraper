He got this girlfriend when he was 19, and when they eventually had sex, he didn't immediately tell the stream. He waited a little while and when the chat was memeing about his virginity, he dropped the bomb. And because he's such a humble guy, he never changed his attitude and just lets people call him a virgin because it's funny. He's an awesome dude. ",

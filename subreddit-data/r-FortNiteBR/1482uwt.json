We ended up hitting a slurp truck down to its last hit, then having another teammate hit our fill with a truck until he bounced him close enough for us to crack the tanker near him. We did it and we lost it laughing that we successfully got our fill to full health.",

After the news season starts there's always some people who al most never play but want to check out. My 6 year old shoots with a grey gun on everything, starts emoting and is fishing on the other side of the map. But he's a happy camper and learning more quickly than I can. He plays a few times and then looses interest and goes back to minecraft. \n\nBut most of the time I like playing with the newbies way more than with the players who think they are God and treat the rest of their team as their personal bodyguards and start swearing and being toxic if they die due to their own stupid shit... Don't mention if you \"steal\" a kill.",

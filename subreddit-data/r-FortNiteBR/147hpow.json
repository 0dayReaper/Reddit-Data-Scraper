Additionally, you can always easily spot other players, especially in dense areas like the jungle, but I'm certainly taking the Cobra DMR over this one. This is because the Thermal DMR doesn't quite register sometimes, and it's very discernible and irritating when I'm supposed to hit half my shots.",

Kits emote is significantly less complex (his legs just go on top of his shoulders that's it). And Beast boy becoming a gorilla is just a puff of green smoke and now he is Monke. That's A LOT of time and effort for a few skins.",

Beast Boy can turn into a gorilla but the metal transforming monkey robot can\u2019t? \n\nLame.",

Lumen and Nanite aren\u2019t just for Fortnite, they\u2019re for the Unreal Engine as a whole, and they\u2019re both lighting compared to animation. Also Lumen was a massive update to the Unreal Engine, this is just a collab.\n\n2. Yes, Fortnite _could_ make a transforming animation for Optimus Prim(al) with their resources, but why would they? It\u2019d be a waste of time creating an entirely new model and rig just for two characters in a collab. Also _minimal_ animations? Have you even seen any live-action Transformers scene? That animation is _not_ gonna be minimal in the slightest lmao. Not only that, but every Transformer is gonna have to have a unique model because they turn into different vehicles, so either Epic use the time and resources to  make two Transformers transform OR they could add way more transformers skins in the future \n\nI\u2019m not defending Epic, I just think people are blaming the wrong thing (game balance, hitboxes or IP issues) when it\u2019s most likely the resources required to make one emote, plus the possibility of adding more transformers (meaning having to make a unique model and transforming emote for each one)",

    "postText": "I'm not going to act like I'm a pro at the game or anything but I'm decent enough to hold my own in squads and carry my team. Since the season dropped I've been getting absolutely shredded by players hiding around corners that don't miss. When I say they don't miss I'm talking hitting me in the head consecutively while I'm jumping, sprinting and sliding before I can get behind cover dropping me from 250 to 0 in seconds with no chance at a reversal. Did Epic fuck with the SBMM or something because I feel like I'm playing ranked or pro-league games all of a sudden.",

Every game I'll get full magged by someone that just popped up behind me with 100% crit accuracy through me sprinting, jumping, weaving and sliding before I can get to cover. It just is boggling my mind when I've never had this issue to this severity at season launches.",

Jumping will make AA go sticky, crouch when your instinct is to jump.\n\nThe Drum Gun and the Flapjack have pretty strong AA so a lot of players are locking on hard close range.",

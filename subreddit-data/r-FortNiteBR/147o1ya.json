Some days I\u2019m grinding for XP or practicing to get better at something.  And other days, I\u2019m figuring out what I need to do to play better and get some Victory Royales.\n\nThat\u2019s the aspect of the game I love the most; the strategies to win are always changing and the right think to do in any situation is highly dependent on context (loadout, health, terrain, zones, remaining players, play style and much more im sure)\n\nEvolve Jake (YouTuber) has some great videos on how to play the game; his videos are easily digestible and contain straight up no nonsense tips of how to play the game.   His videos give you so much food for thought and have help me player better and win some games now and again.  You might want to check home out if you haven\u2019t heard of him.\n\nKeep on sweating, grinding or vibing fella!",

That\u2019s what I like about the game.  The constant cycle of reviewing one\u2019s in game decisions and questioning  whether I should or could have had a better strategy in a particular moment.\n\nThe three aspects you mention (good loot, good positioning, decisions to engage) can sometimes be in conflict and you may have to make choices between them.   \n\nI\u2019m not a particularly skilled player so learning how to deal with in game situations to make the most of my meagre skills is an important aspect of enjoying the game.  \n\nUnless I\u2019m just grinding quests; of course!",

The assist just levels it out some. All the top players still use mouse and keyboard for a reason. Go cry somewhere else or play a game that doesn't \"play itself\" lol. You keyboard homer people are something else.",

Esports teams have come forward admitting the controller is overpowered right now and that there\u2019s no competing without using how busted AA is currently.\nThis has been the case for years now and you people just talk out your ass and make shit up. If you firmly believe keyboard and mouse is strictly better, Buy a pair for less than a wireless controller and plug them in to the console to play. It\u2019s been a thing since PS3. But no I know you people will NEVER do that because you\u2019re scared that if you do you\u2019ll realize how bad you are without aim assist.",

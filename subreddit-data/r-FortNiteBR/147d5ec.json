    "postText": "It took a couple of days for me to report this as I had trouble logging into my Epic account on my laptop. On the last night of the Battle Pass I went to buy the last few levels to get all the bonus rewards. As you can see in the pictures I attached, it glitched on me on the buy extra levels screen and wouldn't let me buy the levels. There was well over an hour left in the season when I tried to buy. You can look at my account if you want and see I bought the V-bucks before the season ended. My Epic account is Willster999. I tried to report with a screenshot in game but it wouldn't let me take a screenshot on the buy extra levels screen. What can be done to resolve this issue or possibly get the bonus rewards added to my account? I am a little bummed out over this glitch as I was looking forward to getting all the rewards this past season. Edit: I am playing on XBox One consol. #Bug #Fortnite #Glitch\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zozd20si5i5b1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=912705cf04e5044eb47d40c3e7c09ab08c4f1ed3",

I think it was on the second and on the last day about four hours before the season ended they stopped people from buying everything it\u2019s not a glitch it\u2019s not a bug you should\u2019ve done it earlier.",

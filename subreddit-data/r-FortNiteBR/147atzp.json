    "postText": "I've seen a lot of controversy over this season, particularly the loot pool and lack of mobility. So with that being said, what would YOU change about this season? I'm hoping if this gets enough attention Epic will see this and use it as a potential way to make this season better for the community.\n\nHere are my top 3 changes:\n1.) Replace the Drum Shotgun with the Ranger Shotgun.\n- This allows the shotgun meta to feel less \"spammy\" requires more thought.\n\n2.) Add the Grapple Glove \n- This is to commemorate the \"no mobility\" accusations.\n\n3.) Buff the damage of the Kinetic Boomerang from 60 to 75. \n- The boomerang is great, but I feel like 60 isn't enough considering it lacks mobility unlike the other kinetic items.",

Increase blast radius of recall\n\n2. Allow players to direct the boomerang's turn back using their camera instead of the up-left angle it always takes\n\n3. Allow the recall to happen instantly instead of a cooldown\n\n4. Highlight the boomerang behind walls\n\n5. Buff explosion damage to ~100 without changing blast radius or normal damage\n\nEdit: 6. Allow the boomerang to pick up items and bring them to you (mostly as a reference to the Legend of Zelda boomerangs pre- BotW.)\n\nThose are just 5 things I could think of. All of which would add more depth to the boomerang instead of avoiding the problem with a direct damage buff.\n\nI feel like the Double barrel and Ranger could've been good competition for each other, but the DB would need a reload speed buff and a slight accuracy increase to be balanced with the ranger\n\nThe grapple glove would be an alright addition, but things like shadow bombs with a duration increase could be better since the thermal items would get some use as a counter to the invisibility.",

On the one hand I'm fine with how it is now but i feel like a small tweak with it's handling would suffice, like if it hit two targets on the way from the user and on it's return path as well with better seeking (not outright aimbot of course but I feel like it's \"return\" summon is a bit lacking) although it's ability to go through builds on the way back has helped.",

The heavy sniper and grenade nerf was a foolish decision on Epic's part, so I undid it, and I removed cars because they've been in the game too long and are preventing other, more fun vehicles from returning.

The reason I would make this change is because the Drum Shotgun genuinely requires minimum skill, since you can perpetually trigger other players by just shooting everywhere. Another thing I would change is the Tier 100 battle pass skin, which is exceedingly controversial and disputable. However, in my personal opinion, I was expecting a bit of a better Tier 100 skin other than Optimus Prime (which is still very unique, so no hate is going towards it whatsoever). Overall, this season is probably not better than the previous season, but still a very awesome one.",

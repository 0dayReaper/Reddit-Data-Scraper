The shorts should be looser than that and if I wore shorts that tight I\u2019d have a rash. Tracing over the outline of the original drawing (her body) will inevitably make her clothes look tighter than intended resulting in more emphasis on certain areas. Drawing clothes slightly past the outline would make them look more natural and not place too much emphasis on certain areas. Obviously the waist of the shorts and collar of shirts would be touching the outline.\n\nHonestly it is awkward to draw people or humanoid characters for that reason alone.",

    "postText": " I'm getting input delay in Fortnite only on my keyboard. I'm not sure what the cause is, but when I play my CPU gets from 90-100%. I'm currently overclocking i5 4670k from 3.4GHz to 4.0GHz. If I use the base overclock of 3.4GHz, I get an even worse delay. My GPU is always around 50-70% when playing. And I have 24GB of RAM but only about 12GB gets actively in use. I'm currently using a MSI Z87-G45. I also get the most delay when in Battle Royale, and not in Creative but still noticeable in Creative. Could anyone suggest a fix? If you need any details I will more more than happy to give you the info you need. And sorry if I posted in the wrong Community this was just the closest I could find to hep with my problem. ",

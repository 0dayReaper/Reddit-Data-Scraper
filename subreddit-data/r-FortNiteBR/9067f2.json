He always thought it was dumb. I love the game, especially the teamwork aspect of 50v50, which I thought would be great for his first game. Lots of action but not too hard. The first fucking game we play, we\u2019re at the edge of the storm with 2 others. I get knocked and crawl in to be rez\u2019d by my brother. There\u2019s a Red Helmet (forgot the name) and a default in an ATK. As my brother is healing me, the fucks in the ATK hit us into the storm so that we both die, just to get our loot. How sweaty do you have to be to be that much of a douche?",

Most plasma center will pay your $30-40 a trip, I have friends who go the 8 times a month and make around 250-300 extra a month. \n\nAll you would need is to go one time though and you could buy the battle pass and its free for you to do and one trip and you could have enough to buy the next 3-4 battle passes.

They take the clear part of your blood for an hour a day, twice a week for $45 a pop. You can watch Netflix while they do it, or just kinda chill out. That's $90 a week just for 4 to 5 hours out of your week.\n\nSure, in a way you can see it as work, and if you are super cynical it's like being milked, but it's not all that bad. And yes, they will make 20x what they pay you for your blood, but at the end of the day, you still get paid for very little effort. Also like a cow, I don't care what's going to happen to my \"milk\" after they take it. Some old dude could drink it for all I care.",

The police of Chicago came in and shot all of the protesters and hanged the leaders the next day. Everyone else in the world saw how horrible that was and made it an international Labor Day... everyone except for America, because we wanted people to forgot the darker part of that history. \n\nEdit: literally just something I vaguely remembered from an old professor. Not a historian, found the wiki and it said \u201cThe Haymarket Affair is generally considered significant as the origin of international May Day observances for workers\u201d. Maybe my prof was wrong but it was worth stating I think.",

Plus it helps support Epic. \n\nI easily make that 10 bucks within my first hour of work so the content I get for my money is a good deal. It's a pretty good middle ground for those of us whom don't want to spend tons of money on skins but still kind want to have skins to switch between and to enjoy.",

Like I tend to be pretty sporadic with my game playing in the sense that I usually don't play one game for too long before getting bored and finding a new game to play.  And basically rotating through the games I'm currently playing.\n\nSo as a result I usually don't end up playing any one game on a super consistent basis. Just whatever I feel like playing. \n\nSo I usually find it hard to justify spending money on a game for cosmetics that I'm just going to get bored of fairly quickly. Fortnite on the other hand has kept me busy and doing the challenges has been fun for me. So I can justify it.\n\nI have no problem with people that spend money on free games. Its just a thing I tend to avoid because it doesn't usually have s justifiable reason for me",

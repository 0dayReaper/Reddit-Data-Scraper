    "postText": "alright the current season has a big problem, the drum shotgun. its insanely powerful and it instantly beats every other shotgun regardless of tier differences. in every drop the first question isnt \"who gets a gun\" but \"who gets the drum first\". ive had several rounds where my purple tier havoc or maven loses to a green drum because i have to repeatedly press and be precise, they just have to stand there and hold down the trigger. it makes the entire game less fun. so i have come up with not just a good way to replace it but a cool policy for handling the shotgun pool in a season. firstly, replace the drum with the auto shotgun. problem solved. shotgun fires fast but is balanced. this leads into my plan for the shotgun pool, which is thus; every season have three to four types of shotguns. now imagine a line that looks like this\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nslow heavy damage---------------medium fire mid damage------------high fire low damage\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nusing this chart we can see how previous seasons did it. last season had havok, maven, and combat. havok is on the far end, maven is in between the middle and right and combat was on the right. however, when the balance is too far to one side, be it in quality or just how powerful a gun is, the season is less fun. last season had a very heavy trend towards the havok at first until it was tweaked. this season leans VERY far to the opposite side thanks to the drum.  i also think that we could use more variety, like a new pool each season or every couple seasons. now one idea i have for this seasons shotgun pool is to replace the havok with the striker, the maven with the two shot or lever, and the drum with the auto shotgun.",

I could just build and get the high ground, peak, and one shot with my havoc. Then I gave ZB a try and got decimated. If you can\u2019t build your own cover, you\u2019re a sitting duck in front of a drum user.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the grammar tip, I was typing on mobile so I was expecting it capitalize automatically but it didn\u2019t so oh well. And secondly I have been playing long enough to be good with shotguns and recently I had a pair of back to back fight losses that were stupid. First, I\u2019m using purple maven versus green drum. They messed with the way the maven fires and I still haven\u2019t gotten used to it, but even with that not being the case I was landing multiple headshots yet that didn\u2019t change them melting me with the green drum. Or another time where I had just landed and only picked up a blue havock before someone came at me with a white drum all I was able to do was land one headshot before they mowed me down. So the problem isn\u2019t damage per shot the problem is the firing speed and mag size. And I wasn\u2019t pointing out that the shotgun had a high damage per shot difference between tiers, the problem is, again, it fires both insanely fast and is full auto. All other shotguns have to be fired semi auto to reach max firing speed(like the combat or maven) but the drum shotgun doesn\u2019t and so it takes no skill to use well",

And there shouldn\u2019t be sniper rifles in zero build, if anything there should be seperate weapon pools for build and zero build. And if you want a good list of shotguns for this season go striker pump, two shot, auto.",

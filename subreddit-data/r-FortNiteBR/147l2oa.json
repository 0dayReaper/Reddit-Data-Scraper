    "postText": "First of all, the game runs way smoother on switch than I expected.\n\nSecondly, WHY ARE THERE SUCH STRONG WEAPONS? I thought we'd learned from season 2 to not put OP mythics in the game. I can't count the number of games where I've been erased from full health by a drum shotgun or combat smg. The Boomerang is a little too weak compared to all other weapons, and the maven is useless against the drum. I like the changes to movement, but I feel like the season has a lot of unused potential.",

For the longest time \u201cmythic\u201d was only a STW rarity and only the infinity blade had the rarity. Then the community wondered like \u201cwill they ever add mythic as a rarity?\u201d and the first time they did it, it was such a good idea and made season 2 chapter 2 fun and fresh. The idea held strong but it\u2019s been season after season of mythics to the point where the word mythic doesn\u2019t even hold much value to me.",

We\u2019ve had them before and I don\u2019t remember ppl complaint about them being significantly more OP than a stinger smg or anything. \n\nDrum shot gun, sure. Probably not good against a green maven but the heisted mavens are at tons of Holochests now. Or one pump them in the head and finish them with an smg.",

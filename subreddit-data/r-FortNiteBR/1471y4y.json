The plants are so huge and really give a great jungle feel. Also, there are plenty of ways to get out of the poi, which I like. As a shotgun user I also love the drum.",

No more pulse rifle/havoc pump or go home. \nMobility has been nerfed so positioning actually counts for something. New biome is big and really well thought out. \n\nOverall, very good start. Much better than the last two seasons (especially last season) as far as I'm concerned.",

At least here you can find combat smgs and drum shotguns everywhere. If you have one and I have one that's a fairer fight based on skill then if you have a pulse and I have any other weapon from last season.\n\nAlso combat SMG recoil is not insignificant and the drum doesn't seem do the same damage it used to, I've survived plenty of fights against drums. Havoc pump? Boom, one shot, match over. It was, frankly, bollocks.",

I think the reason for that is unlike the last time we had the drum, the pump is actually viable against it whereas the striker pump just wasn\u2019t \n\nOther than that I love the flapjack, the map changes are really good, I love the new vaults, I\u2019m enjoying the lack of mobility items honestly and I\u2019m sure at some point we\u2019ll get some good mobility again but for now it\u2019s a nice change and really rejuvenated the game / play style for me",

It's so easy to get lost and ruins POI are literally so deja vu in this game so it's not something too exciting for me at least\n\nThe new weapons are ... a bit weird? Like the boomerang is sooo hard to aim compared to some rifles and it doesn't reward you with good damage (60 seriously?) The combat smg is great. The transformers weapon is not really fun imo bu I'll say it's pretty balanced, should maybe do a lil bit more damage because you're very vulnerable when using it but that's just me\n\nMobility is what make the game interesting and more surprising because before, at any time, anyone could rush you and attack you. It made the game more unpredictable.\n\nThe pass is awful, I only like a skin. The transformers collab is soooooo lazy, like no transformation emote or glider or anything??? But that's not gameplay\n\nMy opinion here, it's subjective and I'm happy for everyone who enjoy the game :)",

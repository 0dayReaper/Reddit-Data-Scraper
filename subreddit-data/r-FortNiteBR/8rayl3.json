I actually just opened the game to check and if you open the map during a replay it displays the region. A square on the map is 375 meters, and the region seems to extend juuuust a little more than that from your character, so maybe 400 meters max. You wouldn't have been able to watch that shot be fired in the replay system, unless a teammate was at least 63 meters closer to it  ",

If I can have my settings on medium/high with no shadows and stick at 165fps, then I'm going to do that rather than be on performance mode.\n\nEDIT: I want to make a strange point, that commonly on PC I have always switched off or lowered shadows as it allows me to have my other settings higher. I don't have shadows off for competitive reasons.",

(If they really had the advantage, pro players would switch over in order to have a better chance at that sweet tournament money. I mean... why wouldn't they?)\n\nPerformance mode has reason to exist, as does aim assist. But the state of crossplay and SBMM doesn't tend to match people properly. This shows the type of gap in fairness that can occur due to that. (And even here I basically acknowledge that Switch deserves any advantage it can get.)",

Now,  only 3 random ones are active at a time. If you have this one to collect items, but your actions would have progressed a different one in the same category... then too bad.. no progress is recorded. \n\nThat is objectively worse than it was before.\n\nOh, and you blaming campers for some reason? They would have had to do the things for the milestones before. That part is no different between the systems, so that argument makes zero sense.",

For whatever reason, if the stack overflows into a new stack, it won't count it AT ALL. There was something else too, I forget. I did find that it won't count anything you purchased either. But I hired the specialist at the gas station southeast of Mega City and the bandages they drop count.\n\nEven with all of that, I still need 150-200 more.\n\nAnyways, if only I knew about the gas station trick 5 games ago.

Its not that he ran out of building materials, its that he physically couldnt place any more stairs according to the game physics. They then realized the only way that the person stuck on the bottom would be to get back up is to put the ATK down there. A little feature on the ATK\u2019s roof is that when you jump on it, you get launched into the air as if you had just jumped on a pile of tires (so the kart roof and tires have almost the same bounce properties). So the person had planned to bring the ATK down to the bottom so that they could both jump on top of it, sending them high enough to reach the closest part of the bottom of his \u2018rescue build\u2019, except that when he brought the ATK down that steep cliff, he accidentally knocked off the person he was trying to save. As you can see, regardless of the outcome, his rescue attempt was not made in vain, as Epic also tried to fix the root problem by placing those tires down there to help get back to the top as well.

They usually just toss a game, some DLC\u2019s and tell us to play with those until they come out with the next game (COD) but Epic\u2019s employee\u2019s really sit back listen to the issues and bugs with the game and fixes them promptly. They watch the fan made videos as well as art/character designs and given enough traction it could possibly be added in. They listen to map design suggestion of people, one of the POI (I think its Haunted Hills?) was actually suggested by someone on this subreddit.\n\nIt\u2019s just really awesome having a game company and its developers be so hands on with its community. We been so used to being used and abused by EA, Activision, ect. for all these years. It\u2019s such a surprise when you download a game as great as Fornite and find out the developers hear what we say, put the players first and the money second....To an extent ahah",

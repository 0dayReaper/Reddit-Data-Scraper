When I play with my friends I\u2019ll just run off cause most times it seems like there\u2019s only 3 real full teams until you get a win then the sbmm gets better and you\u2019ll olay against more real players. Just miss everyone being real honestly I hate they implemented bots at all. Takes away from wanting to play regular modes. Like hell yea I just killed 3 bots running in a straight line at me",

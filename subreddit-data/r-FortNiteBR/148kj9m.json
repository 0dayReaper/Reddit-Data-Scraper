            "comment": "For Zero Build this season, my main tip would be to pay very close attention once the moving zones start, and try to rotate to the new zone before any other players get the chance.  Driving a car to rotate helps immensely with this particularly if you get an unlucky circle and need to travel a long way.  I've got 5 wins this season already and most of them happened because once the match came down to the final 1v1 I was already in the new circle and my opponent wasn't.",

The key to winning for me is staying out of fights I don\u2019t think I can win, surviving to the very end, and then getting the drop on people. I get everything I can to be able to detect the last player first (people tend to hide) and then elim them (thermal fish, thermal dmr, follower that will shoot at them lol). I\u2019ve won two solo matches this season following this. First W I had 10 kills, second I only had 5 but all of those were within the last 15 players",

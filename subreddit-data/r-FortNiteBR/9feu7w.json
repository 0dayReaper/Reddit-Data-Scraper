However, after he spent some of my money (with my permission) on a skin, I investigated further and realized that skin meant outfit. Forgive my ignorance, I apologise for this hiccup. \n\nUpdate: I told him that a lot of people saw and liked his suggestion. He got pretty excited and said he is going to draw a more detailed picture after school. So thanks for all his support. Maybe this may become an avenue he pursues down the road in 10 years. ",

Granted, everything should be done with balance and moderation, but some parents are outright dismissive with no reason why. \n\nI play casually (maybe a few times a month), but subscribe to this sub mostly so I can have talking points with my patients. Just knowing some of the news and lingo is enough to make some of my patients go from stand-offish to open and excited right away. So keep up being a rockstar parent. ",

I am not good at the game and spend my time following him around and reviving him when he\u2019s down, or collecting build materials to give to him. It allows us quality time to get to know each other and when he has friends over they think I am so cool because I have several skins and play with him. I had one of his friends tell me I am the coolest mom because I played with them for 2 hours one night they had a sleep over.  As I spent time with them I heard about the girls they like, the teacher who let them clown around in class and how one of his friends had 4 girlfriends at one time \ud83d\ude02.

    "postText": "About 4 days before the new season update my game started not letting me load into matches. It would have me ready up, queue for a match, then before loading me into the map and game stop me saying \u201cMatchmaking Error #3\u201d. It doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue with a specific game mode cause I\u2019ve tried Build on/off, solo, duo, trio, and different creative maps but none would work. \n\nSo far I\u2019ve tried:\nVerifying Game Files\nUninstalling and reinstalling the game\nRebooting my internet and some other related ideas\nSwitching matchmaking region\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! I just want to be able to play with my friends again.",

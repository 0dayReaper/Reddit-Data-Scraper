    "postText": "This has been an ongoing issue for TWO YEARS. The Predator built-in bio mask emote is broken. When you do it, 9 out of 10 times the mask is not removed. It\u2019s classic master chief from Halo CE final cutscene. Removing the helmet to reveal the helmet.\n\nThis leads to a much bigger issue, a lot of built in character changeable emotes don\u2019t work. TnTina is another example. Will these issues ever actually be resolved?",

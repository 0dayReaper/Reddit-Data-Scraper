    "postText": "So this all started out of nowhere, I have a pretty good pc and it can run any game I try to play and it used to run Fortnite perfectly until a couple months ago when it would start randomly crashing my pc. It could be in the lobby of halfway through my first match or just not at all but for whatever reason and with only Fortnite my pc keeps crashing. The screen turns black for a few seconds and then after it boots back up at my Lock Screen. I asked some of my friends who are good with pcs to take a look at it and hardware wise they told me everything looked good, I even bought a new power supply thinking that could be the issue and it wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hardware related, if my pc can run elden ring I feel like it should be good playing Fortnite. I tried deleting the local app data and then re-verifying the files and that didn\u2019t fix it. I also tried deleting and reinstalling the game but that didn\u2019t help either. It\u2019s so weird that I never had an issue with this and then one night it just started but if anyone knows anything that I could try to fix it I\u2019m open to suggestions",

Never would have thought in a million years that would be the culprit of my crashing, but it was kind of last resort thing that I just happened to read on some obscure forum and sure enough it ended up resolving my issue. Bought a new DP cable from Amazon and haven\u2019t had an issue since.",

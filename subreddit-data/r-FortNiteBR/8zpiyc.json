Sure, you couldn\u2019t really run, your fielding was terrible and you hit like a malnourished child. But, surely it was your effort that would\u2019ve counted? You even soiled yourself one summer when you were 12 because the inning wasn\u2019t over and you didn\u2019t want to disappoint papa. You fought for his approval in vain and now he only supports Jimmy, because he has collegiate scouts watching him play simply because he can throw 96mph and can hit long dongs. It\u2019s not fair I know, but you brought it upon yourself. ",

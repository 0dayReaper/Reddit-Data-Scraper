I doubt this would ever happen, but as someone who is waaaay below average at playing this game, it would definitely make it more fun and a lot less taxing ",

The first few seasons of Overwatch I hit gold and diamond, and that was throwing all my game time at it and then some. Got a different job with more stable hours, do more shit socially now, less time to play. I eventually trickled down to bronze and quit.\n\nIt's cool, I enjoy being in on the early wave and riding the high of a moderately fair playing field, but once 25%+ of the player base is putting in 15+ hours a week I have a hard time keeping up with that. I mostly play single player anyways, being able to pause is pretty clutch when living with one's significant other.\n\nApex is already slipping away from me, it's gone by so damn fast lol. C'est la vie.\n\nEDIT: Oh right, I forgot that in the last few days I saw a bunny hopping infinite scroll video so even though I have a Logitech mouse with that feature this game has already risen beyond my level.",

That said, I've also gotten incredibly good this and last season (started season 3). My definition is consistenly getting 5-7 kills (against sweaties) and crack top 10. The skill at Top 10 though is insane. I rely 100% on outwitting and it's still too big a dispairty in skill. Hopefully we get a ranked system this season or I'll soon say my loving farewell to this game",

Unless you have enough time to dedicate to the game, other players will get way better than you and make it no fun. As a person with a full time job who likes to play a variety of games rather I don't foresee myself picking fortnite up again anytime in the near future. Furthermore it makes it difficult for new players to enjoy the game, ranked systems like Rocket League's are far superior for longevity of a game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Alright, I get that i made a typo and that fortnite is a third person shooter, but my point remains the same",

Playing with one on your team is so nice because they always are where they're supposed to be and will put the ball right where it needs to be when passing. Playing against them and their aerial dribbles, mustys, flip resets, etc fuckin blows though",

Jesus playing people that were barely cutting Glad was like practicing against shitty bots or something. I'll never forget the first time we were making fun of our opponents and laughing at how bad the matchmaking was to put us against them only to realize they were Gladiator ranked themselves when we actually won decent rating points from it. But they were literally better than 99.5% of the people that actually play pvp, and if I tried to play a match against people at that level now when I'm not taking it seriously, it would be truly pathetic.

It\u2019s crazy how much the level of sweat has ramped up over the last month and a half. \n\nI really think this directly coincides with the materials collection/health regen changes. I like the changes in a vacuum but they without a doubt benefited strong players a lot more than casuals. The best players now have enough mats to build you to death within the first two minutes of the game and then for the entirety of the game and the health regen makes it so they can play full out aggressive the whole time without the worry of getting 3rd partied before they have a chance to heal.

Super fun game that lumped the sweaties in with the normies since both the devs (Respawn) and the no-lifers were so against MMR/ELO. Multiplayer imploded within 4 months of launch after the player base had sufficiently stratified (by time invested). By the time the devs acknowledged the problem, they had already lost 90% of their player base since all the casual guys had left and no new guys stuck around for more than a match or 2 of getting shit on and spawn camped.",

Grandmasters and masters in the same game as bronze and silver? It would be miserable, which is what it\u2019s like to play fortnite right now if you can\u2019t play for hours everyday.\n\nEpic can figure it out. Create specific rewards that only players who reach certain ranks or tiers can get, on par with Overwatch\u2019s special icons or sprays for reaching Top 500 and such. Special skins and cosmetics. You can\u2019t tell me sweaties wouldn\u2019t want a way to show how sweaty they are? Doubtful. If you can get an icon next to your name in game indicating you are a top 500, there will be less smurfing. Or if you can get a skin no one can buy that shows your high rank status? Sweaties would be less inclined to throw games to get in lower ranks.\n\nJust my two cents.",

Trying to enjoy some duos with a friend and the people you run in to are just not fun to fight. I'm a decent builder and I have good aim, but when every single fight the entire match is people playing like there's a cash prize, it sucks the fun right out.\n\nWould much rather play Apex where it doesn't feel as hopeless.",

It\u2019s hard as fuck to get better because you\u2019re put in a lobby with people of varying skill level. That\u2019s like saying if rocket league had a ranked system where bronze players (lowest rank) get paired with grand champs (highest rank). Obviously you\u2019re not gonna actually progress that much. You\u2019re gonna get crushed. \n\n",

Only picked up fortnite for about a week, but reading these comments made me want to chip in with a relevant story. \n\nI played Battlefield 4 religiously every waking moment of every waking fucking day. Thousands of hours of game time. Top of the leaderboard every match. I\u2019m being deadly serious here. Streamed, had followers, did well. \n\nOne day I realised how much it had taken over my life. I wasn\u2019t going to bed with my wife. I wasn\u2019t playing with my kids. My back was so fucked from sitting on a stool in front of a TV I had to change jobs and it affected my every day life to the point I couldn\u2019t do any sports, couldn\u2019t move properly and couldn\u2019t do everyday shit. My mind was running so fast I couldn\u2019t sleep. Playing the game would make me sweat and shake when I finished as I was hyper aware of everything. When I was driving down the road my mind was looking for \u2018players\u2019 in the real world. \n\nI quit, and it\u2019s been amazing. I hadn\u2019t realised how much a pointless video game had robbed me. It\u2019s ultimately absolutely pointless guys. You\u2019re playing and interacting with people who you will probably never meet. You\u2019re concentrating on things that ultimately, in this life we have, are utterly and totally useless and serve no purpose whatsoever. \n\nYou may be good at it, but you can get good at anything with enough time. Use that time Wisely is my advice to you all, it is sucking your life and probably money. \n\nThis will probably get buried. Good luck to you all. ",

Streamers were loud and clear asking Epic to not do it, but now that little Timmy and his friends has caught up with building and the game mechanics suddenly its a problem?\n\nThese people don't care about casuals, competitive players or even Fortnite, they're streamers and only care about their own content",

    "postText": "Chapter one had Shockwave Grenades and I gotta know if you guys think Kinetic Ore is the same mineral used in Shockwave Grenades even though Kinetic Ore wasn't introduced until Chapter 4. I also had a theory back in chapter one that the mineral used in Shockwave Grenades is Kevin the Cube because of having similar properties, so if that is true, could Kinetic Ore just be fragments of Kevin too? \ud83e\udd14",

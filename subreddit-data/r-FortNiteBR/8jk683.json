The entire trip the one guy would randomly beg his friend to play Fortnite when they get back so I know they play the game. These two guys in the video sound exactly like them and it made me happy because they were genuinely just the nicest/funniest/coolest dudes I've met in a long time. Idk why I'm sharing this but it made happy. ",

The friction slows your crosshair down when on an enemy, the magnetism helps to track them, and the snap moves your crosshair closer to the enemy when you ADS.\n\nFortnite and CoD zombies are the only games I've played with proper aim snap. Usually they have friction, sometimes they have magnetism, very rarely do they have aim snap. And when they don't have aim snap, rapidly adsing does nothing other than make you hip fire between accurate shots.\n\ntagging /u/jprosk ",

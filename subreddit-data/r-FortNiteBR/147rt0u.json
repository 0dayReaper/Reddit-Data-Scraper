I'm surviving through some tough gunfights and it's not through skill it's the fact I'm bouncing all over and an erratic target. I mean, I struggle to get shots in myself due to lag but my duo teammate can get elims while I run into close range combat as distraction? I dunno. It sucks, I wanna enjoy the new biome and stuff but mantling etc is super frustrating with the lag. It's a silver lining I guess that I can't get hit so easily? But I'd much rather be a better target and be able to move around better!!",

Both of your shots were a little too far to the left. If you rewatch it a few times, you can clearly see it.\n\nI'm not trying to hate on your post, but both weren't bugs.

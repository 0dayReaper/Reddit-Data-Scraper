Just because you don\u2019t have a quick get out of the storm free card like Spider-Man gauntlets or odm gear doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no mobility. You still have vehicles, 3 different types of animals to ride, vines, zip lines, the occasional launch pad and rift, slap juice and now mud. You don\u2019t need to travel across the map in 5 seconds with broken and annoying to play against mythics.\n\nEven while you\u2019re in the storm, you have med mists, slaps, bandaids and medkits to help you survive the storm plus the new healing plants and animals to kill.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of time to get even to the farthest of circles. Look at the map more often and pay attention to how long you have until you need to move rather than bashing the mobility when you could have planned better",

After the first few games though I realised that it\u2019s quite a nice change of pace.",

Last season really spoiled us with mobility, so now that there\u2019s a normal amount of it again people are complaining because they used those insane mobility as their crutches for getting out of fights they\u2019re losing, and rotating to circle since they don\u2019t check the map",

But, respectfully, I don't know what on God's green Earth you all are talking about. Kinetic blade was absolutely not balanced mobility (nor was ODM or Web-Shooters). Apart from the offensive capabilities of ODM, in many aspects kb was even better for cheese engaging/disengaging because it was less telegraphed.",

Too bad I don't play build mode.",

There is not even a consideration that maybe you shouldn't land on the outskirts if you have troubles paying attention to the zone. It's the games fault for not giving enough OP movement items. And then when you die to another player yielding those items it's also the games fault.\n\nThis game has SO much mobility. Look at other BR like PUBG, you either walk or find a vehicle. There are no magic anti gravity bounce items that propel you half way across the map. \n\nWhen someone dies to Zone in Fortnite, 99% of the time it's their own fault for not playing accordingly.",

Its perfect how it is now, I hope there will never be a mobility item again altough i loved the swords, its just better for the game without it, and as you said indeed, there is so much mobility like cars etc that make you go FAST around the map aswell. so its perfect, i love the season",

With things like raptors, vehicles and rails/vines, you can certainly travel long distances.\n\nThe problem is more about *positional* mobility. There are no items that allow you to move short distances quickly, such as to escape a bad spot, push an enemy, get to highground, etc. This is especially bad in the endgame where there is no guarantee that there will be vines or ziplines in the direction you want or present at all, and jumping on the back of an animal or getting in a car isn\u2019t gonna help you in any way either since they get stuck easily and make you an easy target.\n\nThe thing that was so great about the sword was that it wasn\u2019t insanely OP or anything. Only having 3 dashes before needing a recharge, you couldn\u2019t go insane distances in short times, but it at least allowed you to quickly react to gunfire and get yourself in a better spot. Zero build feels very, very dependent on luck of the moving zone now without that item to bridge the gap.",

The person closest to where the circle is moving is already at a massive advantage, and being forced to book it on foot means almost certain death at their hands \n2. Third partying can be even WORSE without mobility, as if somebody approaches you as you just got out of a fight, you are forced to take it, whereas before you had a chance to escape\n\nI can 100% agree that items like the ODM and Spider-Man web shooters, even if insanely fun, are unbalanced. I\u2019m talking about more standard stuff such as the Katana which I would not consider OP, or even an unrechargeable mobility item like shockwave grenades. If it wasn\u2019t clear, my main concern here is zero build. In build, you can use builds to breach the gap and push up in zone but in Zero Build, without mobility, the gameplay doesn\u2019t feel as dynamic and sometimes like luck of the draw. You don\u2019t have to be an arrogant prick about the fact you disagree with me over gameplay. Go play another BR if you\u2019re gonna shit your britches when the game has a more diverse and utility-based lootpool than just a bunch of standard weaponry, or mature up a little bit.",

No items is fine but I think ZB just benefits a lot from this items. 3rd parties are much more deadly now and the natural mobility like the zip lines, animals, flowers and vehicles will not help you with that. Only items like the previous kinetic weapons, movement mythics and shockwaves will which is what ppl are asking for. \n\nPushing people with odm, hammers, gloves and katanas was also pretty fun and I do miss that a little ngl. The change of pace is nice but 3rd parties are just awful. And it ain\u2019t even a positioning issue when you are in those moments where the entire map just randomly pops up at one place. Lack of defensive items is also part of the problem. Imo they shouldn\u2019t have removed the bubbles and the quick heals bc this issue would have been a little less annoying",

It just caters way too heavily towards a slow paced noob friendly gameplay. Cars are horrible and we all know that. Launch pads are found at Brutal and Mega city and thats it. Rifts are only by loot island. Animals are too scarce to conveniently find and ride out of the storm. I don\u2019t want to run away from the storm the entire game, the game is a shooter. If i wanted to hide and only care about positioning myself correctly by planning ahead of time, id play some other game.

All while fighting, rebooting and trying to find cover from people waiting at the end of the circle. I was dead and he couldn't find any green life when he had to push up to the hill with 60 hp with fights going on to his left. He barely made it to the hill and it was him against the last team which already was on the hill which is a shit position to be in anyway. But the best part was the circle moving in a way that he could not get up the hill at all. With any kind of mobility item it would at least have been an entertaining fight but this way he just gave up and died to the storm because he had no way of getting up the hill.\nYes, you could say you should plan upfront and he probably would have lost anyway but going out like this just sucks and is frustrating.\nAnd i died before because i tried to climb up a wall as high as the character and it bugged me back down 6 or 7 times which got me into the zone.\n\nReally miss movement because with bugs like that and unlucky zones you stand nearly no chance.",

The point of the game is finding people to kill, not looting until end game. To your point about \u201cskill\u201d, this season actually requires WAY less skill because it is so stagnant, my heart rate doesnt even increase once the entire game. To your point about scaling into the late game, it\u2019s really not fun the the very last team to engage in a fight after hiding all game, pops out in the last moment for an easy kill on enemies who are putting themselves out there actually fighting others. I dont know if you play builds or zb, but zb is absolutely trash now, and majority of the streamers agree with the points I have made. The streamers are an integral part of the community of this game and their opinions matter whether you like to admit it or not. A game that is unenjoyable for the top 1-2%, will always impact viewership, and in turn will impact its player count. If i could take out a billion dollar loan and bet on the game dying if they kept it in the state it is right now, I would do it. I guarantee you they will add mobiility sooner rather than later, because it is essential. I\u2019ll see you back here when they do, it will happen I promise you. Things will not stay like this because it is damaging to the fun of the game",

The kinect blade allowed for a player to turn the tides of a fight. U just get hit with a heavy sniper? Well now u can re-engage with a better angle or u can catch the enemy off guard and push inwards with a kinetic blade.

In no build it was impossible to take the high ground from somebody without mobility items later in the game when the storm blocked the way up, but that was solved by the mobility items (also ones like the hammer and odm were fun to kill with.) there\u2019s also cases where it\u2019s literally impossible to survive the storm because you get trapped in a small pocket with no way to get up (cough cough where hill scrambling) and the storm doing 5-10 dps (although survivable with a full medimist or with slurp juice, your often still left very low) and to people saying plan ahead, sometimes, especially for people  who land in popular places you go from one fight to another where your focus is surviving especially if you have to stop often to find healing. I personally know the past few games I played I had to stop in the storm multiple times and find healing after a fight, and still almost dying because the storm was simply moving too fast.\nAlso the whole \u201duse vehicles or animals\u201d is a fair point till you realize that animals don\u2019t spawn nearly enough (and tamed ones keep dying for me) and vehicles are just inconsistent, especially in the jungle (and let\u2019s be honest the futuristic ones just suck ass) while items allowed you to fairly consistently get where you were going (which you had to sacrifice an inventory slot for.) I Understand it was a little op at times but right now the only true mobility items are slap juice and the run n gun smg, not to mention the removal of movement augments like icy slides and aerialist which were not worth losing for (imo) the shitty augments we got (except soaring sprints my beloved)\n\n\nAlso people apparently think wanting mobility items is entitled/spoiled lmfao",

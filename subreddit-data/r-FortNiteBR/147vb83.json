I like Fortnite, and part of what I like about it is its innocence. \n\nYou used what appears to be a swear word fill in in your title. I believe this should warrant some sort of disclaimer. Maybe not NSFW, maybe I\u2019m being too harsh there, but some sort of tag users can put to indicate profanities. (Reddit, are you listening?) either way, it\u2019s NSFW to me!\n\nIt\u2019s very clear you mean to use \u2018cluck\u2019 as a fill in for \u2018f\u2014\u2014-g\u2019, which is language I prefer not to be around. Thanks for respecting my wishes of a clean, God-respecting, and family friendly environment. Have a blessed day!",

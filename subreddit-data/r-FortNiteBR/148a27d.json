For a week it was one of the best in terms of number of chests and floor loot, and the following week, it was trash due to little or no chests and floor loot. It also proved to Epic that it wasn\u2019t such a good idea to leave the keys of the realm for the players to create whatever place they wanted (the Block was removed after that week\u2019s integrated creation contained a hidden easter egg where there was a flipped over chair and a noose iirc). And it proved that Epic was onto something good with the concept, but backfired and caused the Block to be killed off unceremoniously because of their lack of verification regarding the chosen creations, and that the competitive viability of the POI was never consistent.",

I know the graphics well from that time and I understand what you mean by the simpler graphics.\n\nI also understand that you can feel they are better fit for Fortnite, but I'm sure it's you prefer them out of nostalgia. Like how many people prefer the original look of Minecraft alpha.\n\nHowever, the game has to evolve otherwise it would die. I think they made a good job in modernising the graphics while still keeping a goofy look. \n\nYet again, I agree the models could be still more goofy in their current form.",

And no, developers who produce those graphics can just pick another game to work for if fortnite community doesn't like them, they are wealthy individuals who have talent and availability of work if they chose too, so why feel sorry for them working hard if that's their job? No I never ever said fortnite should default to having \"the worst graphics\" And no, the delay is noticeable, am not incraesing them In a competitive game just to die to some loser. Not everyone wants to be like you. We play the game competitively because that's how we enjoy it. Its like getting angry at someone putting sugar in their tea for a taste advantage and u saying they shouldn't. Let people be. You reduce playability putting graphics up, it's laggy, delayed and I can put up the graphics whenever I feel like. Plus the 'bad graphics' aren't that bad, their on par with Valorant, your acting like it's roblox.",

You really honestly are gonna look at the economy and state of the US and tell a developer, who doesn\u2019t make the big bucks at the company, to go get another job\u2026. Meanwhile companies are still laying off thousands of employees to meet projections of spending to earning. That\u2019s also not fair to say I don\u2019t play competitively because I like better graphics\u2026 it why I own a PS5 and not a PC. I will always sweat hard and win but I will not sacrifice the aesthetic I will have both \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. But thank you for coming to a post about the quality of the graphics when you don\u2019t care about them to find me. (last of us is an amazing game! The ending of the second one was easily one of the most visceral experiences from a game, I genuinely did not want to continue but we Have to \ud83d\ude2d)\n\nLook my guy, I\u2019m not arguing what you\u2019re saying but you\u2019re choosing to ignore my whole point. If you have the ability to have both good graphics and gameplay and you choose to have bad graphics to have the advantage I personally think that\u2019s lame. If your gameplay suffers from the graphics and by lowering it the game is actually playable for you then that\u2019s the situation and I\u2019m not gonna blame someone for their technologies capacity. I\u2019m never gonna stop nor want to impose myself on the way someone plays, but why then have we created all these advancements in games then? I don\u2019t believe just because Fortnite is a battle Royal that is wrong for the creators to want to make a beautiful game. With the amount of skins and the amazing designs we\u2019ve seen through the years I can\u2019t say it\u2019s not just for people to want to see it all in a better image.",

And the ended had me raging!! I spent time and traveled all that way just to slap Abby up abit?? Huh? Ellie???????? But nah the majority of pc players are not streamers nor are they playing on pc that cost 5,000 plus. The Average pc player plays on those settings for convenience. If they get to play on both but chose performance mode it's for performance lol, no matter how good the pc is that mode would always be more preferable as it would preform better. Games advance to apply to different niches but they aren't perfect, although the setting for high graphics are nice, having my pc start flying, sounding like a Boeing 747, produce more air than a plane I start to wonder if its worth it\ud83e\udd23 am not saying those graphics are bad, it's the opposite their great, but in a battle royal people should have the option to be able to play how they wish, and if performance is one of those wishes I don't see why it shouldn't be granted.",

I\u2019ll always love Ellie but after the last one I wouldn\u2019t mind her taking a back seat in the story as more of a supporting plot character to pop in towards the end (perhaps the cure finally?) it was just such a deep and dark journey for her and I\u2019d almost rather them not let us see her till we \u201chave to\u201d to really amp up the solo path she chose. She deserves to sit and think about what she did \n\nIt should and will always be an option as long as gamers cant own turbine engines in their house never the less a processor that sounds like one \ud83d\ude02. Then it comes down to epic re coding certain things to not be affected by the lower setting. For me it\u2019s strictly the fog and plants in the current poi. Not even about the advantage of seeing through the bushes with no mist, but the whole point of that area is to be shrouded and overgrown and add a bit of difficulty in fighting against players in there. You cant have a guerrilla war fair POI if players aren\u2019t able/don\u2019t want to have the obstacles.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s why I believe they made mega indestructible, to give players an area that you can\u2019t just bulldoze through, you actually have to chase and hide and strategize and move through the environment",

Even in lower graphics its hard to see players, and tbh either way both sides enjoy their time in the biome, lower graphics enjoy the performance and higher graphics enjoy the graphics, so players aren't/don't want to see obstacles and those who do both enjoy it. Plus most players are console, by alot, so guerilla warfare is basically the default. The biome is more aimed at those on high settings tbh.",

Seeing as performance mode is so much better for pc, then epic is more than welcome to recreate a player pool for just y\u2019all again. Overwatch is set up so that pc players only tend to be put into games where another pc player is already teamed up with a console player. Otherwise they match consoles with consoles and pc with pc because of the aim and click advantage, albeit a game of 10 is 10x less than the battle Royal in Fn. If the graphics on a pc are that detrimental that only performance mode is applicable then they should be systematically matched with each other so high graphic players can enjoy their graphics and the game. Because the assumption that console players aren\u2019t competitive and only like graphics is an eye roll. And the fact the game cant run as intended on a pc is also an eye roll. And if pc players as a whole only care about being competitive and not enjoying the games designs then the more competitive game would be only playing with them.",

Console players that are competitive often opt for pc later on. due to console having a larger pool of casuals it just doesnt compare to competitive pc gaming. And I think epic just doesn't have the pc player base, I think am not 100% sure tho, to properly sort players on pc with one another so they chose to instead provide strong aim assist to console players as a alternative. Pc is compatible but performance mode is just more playable, input delay is crazy with it on pc idk why tho. Cross platform has to stay or epic would just loose their pc players to more pc compatible and friendly games, like counter strike or valorant. Pc is likely to include more their high end competitive players and to keep them crossplatform just needs to stay I guess. I play low graphics because of performance and I low-key like them, it's aesthetically pleasing and easy on the eyes, beautifull even.",

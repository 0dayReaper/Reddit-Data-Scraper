Then she laid it on me that they do in fact do all that stuff, and that I was one of them. I was born with several rare and deadly heart defects that needed surgery right away. My parents' insurance refused to cover the medical care and since we lived in Florida, my mom drove to St. Jude's and they accepted me with no charge. I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for them. They did all of the required surgeries, followed up with the checkups required, and gave my mom an apartment for several weeks with food already in the cupboards and fridge so she could stay ready to go while thinking about her dying baby. They even have the refferal when my parents moved states for my dad's new job, which had better insurance. I was completely blown away to hear that. I had no concept of that level of charity and kindness at that age. They're amazing.",

However after watching them do something this big live for one of their creators, I kept the app installed. \n\nDespite the controversy and drama, you have to admit most companies even at the same size and worth of twitch wouldn\u2019t do something like this normally. Twitch has definitely earned my respect again, and it feels good to use the app knowing this company isn\u2019t as evil as it\u2019s made out to be at times.\n\nEdit: Spelling",

Amazon paid no income tax last year - taxes that would have paid for things such as children's healthcare. \n\nCharitable donations are good, but don't let that cloud your judgement about all the lobbying Amazon did to keep from paying taxes that would otherwise fund St. Jude.",

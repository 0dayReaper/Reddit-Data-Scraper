    "postText": "I don\u2019t want to bore you so I\u2019ll keep this short. I\u2019m a LEO (Law Enforcement Officer) and I love fortnite. I\u2019ve been playing it flat since season 2. \n\nTonight I attended a job after a call for service came over that a 12 year old was attempting suicide. We attended and struggled to get him to talk to us. He stated he had made threats to kill himself and I observed several cuts on his wrist. After a good 15 minutes of little conversation with officers, I asked him what usually calms him down when he gets like this and the boy said \u2018when I can just play fortnite and relax\u2019 \n\nWe spoke for a solid 5 minutes about our favourite skins(his favourite was raven), places to land and our favourite weapons and this young boy was amazed that a police officer had heard of Fortnite. He opened right up to me about everything that\u2019s been happening and what got him to this point. \n\nLong story short he\u2019s now receiving professional help and I really feel like fortnite made this job so damn easy for me. I hope this young boy gets the help he needs and maybe one day I can duo with him! ",

I am a quiet depressed person. So every time i play, watch videos or talk about these two games it relaxes me. That's probably why i have played too much both of these games.",

If I can give you some advice, I know its hard to want to change your life when everything seems like shit, but you gotta change some stuff if you want to be happy. \n\nA depressed mind is like a high school bully. It doesn't want you to succeed, it doesn't want you to do the things that make you truly happy. It wants you to be miserable and doing the same old things so it has a pattern it knows to prey on you.\n\nYou gotta be very pragmatic about this. YOU are not a sad/angered/dejected/etc person. Your mind however currently is, and YOU have been on cruise control while it drives you through a ditch. Put your hands back on the wheel and take control. \n\nStart each day by writing in a journal 3 goals, and don't go to sleep till you complete them. My first day was; 1) Go for a walk. 2) Read 20 pages. 3) Bed at 11:00. They shouldn't be difficult, they should be easily doable and serve as a physical reminder that the true you wants you to achieve these goals today, and the only thing stopping you is the bully your mind has become. Make this a habit, and then you can set your sights a little higher. Maybe quit a bad habit, or start a new hobby, learn guitar or something idk.\n\nI hope you find your true self and pull yourself out of this mind state man. I know you can do it, because I did it. Much love and respect, many wins to you and your friends. ",

He started doing the floss dance while waiting to enter the venue and I said \u201cNice moves, fortnite is a great game.\u201d Kid was amazed, eyes opened super wide and he goes \u201cYOU PLAY FORTNITE!?\u201d I said yeah, he started asking me if I had the battle pass, what skins I use. When I told him I had skull trooper the kid was floored. Started looking at me like a freakin\u2019 celebrity. Asked me if I knew Ninja or Drake. I gave him a rose for his sister and told him I don\u2019t know them but maybe I\u2019ll see him out there in BR one day. ",

Every Friday we would take that week's set of first years on a 5 mile hike up and over a small nearby mountain.\n\nInevitably, some of the first years would get upset during the hike, and start crying. The hike isn't super difficult, but can be daunting for a 11 year old without much experience. Also, at that point sometimes being away from parents for so long can make you homesick.\n\nIf some kid starts crying along the way, we cant really stop all 80-150 scouts on the hike, and we want them to enjoy the experience, so we have to try to cheer them up. \n\nMy preferred method was to just engage them in a conversation about video games. Almost all scouts at that age played games, whether it was minecraft, assassins creed, or call of duty, and most would perk right up if you started asking them what their favorite game was. Even though the counselors were only 16-18, the first years saw us practically as adults, and were excited to talk about gaming with an older person who actually enjoyed gaming themselves. \n\nAfter a little but they'd forget about whatever made them upset. Looking back it's one of my favorite memories.",

I live in a different city from them so don't spend a lot of time with the kids. My nephew (who is also my godson) is 11, though, so when I mentioned on the first day that I heard he plays Fortnite, he was so excited that he had someone to talk about it with, even his uncle that he only sees a couple times a year. Whenever we sat next to each other at dinner, he'd always want to ask about my favorite weapons or skins or drops or whatever. He was also checking the news online all the time (this was when the rocket launched) and filling me in on all the details he read about. We really bonded over Fortnite. I like to think I'm a slightly cooler uncle now. ",

A new hockey stick, NERF guns etc. Later that night after his party, I get a text from my sister that was basically: \n\n\"I hate you. LOL. We spent all that money on birthday gifts and his favorite gift was the stupid Fortnite dog tag you gave him.\"\n\nLike, I get that video games (especially Fortnite lately) can be stressful for parents to deal with, but it literally cost me $6 to make the kid's birthday special, vs the $200+ they spent on other stuff that he was \"meh\" about.

And it\u2019s a really good point too, this sub doesn\u2019t have this problem but most subs do, where people just upvote literally anything with a sob story attached to it. This is the first one I\u2019ve seen here but it has 25k+ upvotes (*lmao holy shit*) so you can expect these to start showing up now. \n\nEdit - plus it wasn\u2019t even like he exploited people with his post. He didn\u2019t ask for money or anything, he just showed them they upvote dumb shit 24/7 and that the content we spend all of our time on Reddit looking at is largely fabricated and completely pointless if we aren\u2019t looking out for shit like this",

I was suicidal from a very young age, and while I never got to a point where a police officer was called on me, I did speak to several counselors or therapists. I often spoke about how video games helped me cope, specifically Oblivion. I always got blank stares or indifference. It really was a generational thing or maybe just a lack of understanding that video games can do good. \n\nThankfully, I had a mother who was the type of woman to wait in line for hours to get her NES, so she understood how I was using it to cope and never tried to take games away from me. It would have been transformative to find another authority figure that understands how cathartic gaming can be. ",

I've used it at my job also to connect with scared kids before their surgery. I don't play because I'm terrible managing the controllers but I watch my husband and son and follow this Reddit and it gives me something to talk about with each of them. \n\nKeep it up Epic.

So I decided that I'll share some experiences of my own, just to try and clarify why this hit so close to home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been struggling with clinical depression and anxiety attacks for about 8 years (which is kind of a long time considering I'm only 23) and I have once met someone just like you, that changed my thoughts to the better just by finding common ground between us.\n\nFor me, it was skateboarding. I've always found skateboarding to be my biggest relief from anxiety and depressive periods, as it's the only activity that completely clears my mind from everything else that might dwell in there, and I can totally see why fortnite would be that sanctum for someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really don't know if I have a point in writing all this, but seeing another human do such a kind thing to another is so reassuring and it gives me hope that more people will be saved due to this awesome game/other hobbies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy hat is off for you, officer.

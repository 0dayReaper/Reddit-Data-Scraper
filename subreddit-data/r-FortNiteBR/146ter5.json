I don\u2019t see any reason why is couldn\u2019t just be a normal boomerang. \n\nIf I would have designed it, I would make it a hit and run type of weapon. Imagine throwing it at a guy and then when it flew back to you, you grab the end of it and the Boomerang keeps flying backwards. So it\u2019s not really used for high ground or to escape any encounter, but offers some mobility and battlefield control and professional players would come up with strategies like throwing the boomerang behind them to launch them forward. It would be very reminiscent of Bouncer movement from C1 (where players would jump, rotate 180, and place a wall and a bounce pad to move a bit faster.)",

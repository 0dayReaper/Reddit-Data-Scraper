We wanted to play games together, so I scrounge up the little money i had and bought a small TV for her. That was 10 years ago.\n\nWe've always had 2 tvs to this day. It's a pain to buy everything twice. But it's great to be able to do what we want and not have to worry about hogging the TV lol. We play a ton of games together, side by side. You guys should totally look into a similar setup. And if you're worried about the sound from the other TV getting in the way of your gaming, buy headphones. I got a noise canceling pair.",

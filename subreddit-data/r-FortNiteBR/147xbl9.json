    "postText": "My child's grandma bought him a V-bucks giftcard a while ago (long enough that I'm sure the receipt is long gone).\n\nI just tried to redeem it and its telling me it wasn't activated. Epic is telling me there's nothing they can do. I think it was probably bought at Kroger but not positive. \n\nIs there ANYTHING I can do at this point? Some way to look up where it was purchased via barcode or something?\n\nI'm sure grandpa paid for it lol",

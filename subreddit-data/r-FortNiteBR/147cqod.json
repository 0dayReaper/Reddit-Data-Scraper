The gun itself doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense because of how the distance slug works, even though what you see in game today is actually a rework of the og one. \n\nIt resembles a gun to the sorts of a KSG12 or some kind of SRM arms. \n\nKeep in mind the sucker has yet another iteration in save the world, whose development probably pre dates the battle royale release",

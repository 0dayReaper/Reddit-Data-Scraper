    "postText": "Wondering if Fortnite would see a significant boost with my new cpu at 1440p. I had no problems with the 3070 and 3600 but I\u2019d like to hit stable 165fps on higher graphics settings just to see what it\u2019s like playing with max (non Ray tracing) settings. \n\nI know some games get a big bump from the CPU while others don\u2019t so I\u2019m curious.",

            "comment": "CPU in gaming matters when you deal with a lot of objects in games. Like having to know where all objects are, big open games. Such as a battle royale.  \n\n\nAnother example are those big war games like civilization. GPU how it looks, CPU how much it can compute and process all at once. So yeah, it should make it smoother with a stronger CPU. will process all the objects faster",

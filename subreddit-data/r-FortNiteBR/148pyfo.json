    "postText": "This has been a problem for months and I never see anyone complain about it. \nIf you get unlimited stamina from a slap barrel and drink slap juice after, the combination of both shows you have infinite stamina but you actually dont because its bugged and you end up having the normal amount of stamina. Its a really annoying bug and I believe its the same if you drink slap juice and then break a slap barrel.\n\nTLDR: Slap barrel + Slap juice consumable at same time cancels out the infinite stamina effect. Bug?\nPC",

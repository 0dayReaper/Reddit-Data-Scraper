I've been enjoying realm Royale a lot more because it's less of a standard shooter. And I will be enjoying battle rites battle Royale since it's stop down which is where I am good. But fortnite and pubg are both just very traditional which means I've played a million games like them and I don't exactly want more of it. But I can appreciate it for what it is",

Eventually the meteor hit a part of the map and destroyed it. \n\nThis season the Battle Pass has introduced super hero skins that have been fighting each other in a movie. The rocket is similar to the meteor in the previous season. It is building suspense for the next season which starts in a couple of weeks. ",

Because if the game launched in july (according to google), and season 1 was introduced in october (according to the fortnite wiki), and now it's season 5... damn that's quick. I play another mp game and each season lasts a year, so I don't know, 5 seasons in less than a year is very different from my own perspective.",

Just one island, you drop onto it every game, and for a long time it never changed.\n\nFortnite also has a thing called seasons. Basically just a few months grouped together with one or two themes. The first season was Halloween, the second season was Knights, and the third season was Space.\n\nThis season, season 4, is superhero themed, and the developers have really dove into creating a story of sorts to follow throughout the season. They release weekly updates, and this season's updates have featured changes to the map. So every week, there's new clues to the story and it develops a little further.\n\nThe main storyline features a meteor crashing into the center of the map, as well as a new-this-season Superhero and Supervillain hideouts. In the supervillain hideout, there's been a big rocket all season. About a week ago, a countdown showed up by the rocket.\n\nToday, the rocket finally took off. It happened only one time, at 1:30 eastern time, and it happened in everyone's game. There is a whole story behind it about a superhero that took a weapon from the meteor that crashed and used it with the rocket to try and go home or something, but that's a little more detailed and frankly, I haven't even followed it *that* well myself to tell you any more.\n",

You can go back and watch the game from any angle at any point, as long as you don't stray too far from your character.\n\nIt's led to a lot of cool content from creative people like OP, and of course this one-time event was a must capture",

I think it's really fun because each match is wildly different even if you go to the same place every time. The building is really unique and rewarding once you start to grasp it, even if the actual shooting aspect is a bit weak or weird at times. \n\nIt's free on every platform (PC, XB1, PS4, Switch, and iOS), so the worst that could happen is you try it out and end up hating it. ;)",

This includes changing a major portion of the map every season, as well as minor changes every few weeks. Last season, a few weeks before the end a giant meteor appeared in the sky. As it got closer to the end of the season the meteor continued to get closer, until the end of the season when the meteor hit, and destroyed a large portion of the map, as well as a few smaller meteors hitting and causing damage. This season is super hero themed, and in the beginning of the season a super villains lair was added, that had this giant missile in it. They have been building suspense around it since it appeared, and today the rocket launched. Now there is a giant tear in the sky(which you see at the very end), that will tie into season 5 somehow, which starts in 2 weeks. ",

It's quite a bit harder. I can give some pointers tho.\n\nThe reason you look up when you fire whilst riding a rocket, is so that the slow start of the rocket doesn't push you off your rocket. When you aim it nice and high, it passes over your head, and the hitbox misses you.\n\nWhen moving downward, the jumps are fairly easy. It's almost exactly the distance of 1 full jump, and it's hard to miss if you do it straight on. The HARD part, is trying to jump rocket to rocket whilst moving at an upward angle. You need to aim much higher in the air so that the hitbox does't knock you off, AND you need to make it so it trails much further away. When jumping to the rocket behind you at an upward angle, it's effectively downhill from you. I've flew over it so many times straight to my death. the distance is super hard. I still haven't been able to do this very reliably. \n\nAlso, people in high explosives suck xD. Just LET ME FIND A GUIDED IN PEACE THANKS.\n\nAs for the takeoff, I still suck at that, and I've been trying to master it, but now I have like a 50% success rate. Not really many tips for here. Just follow OP's instructions, and practice a lot. I've failed the takeoff SOO many times. It gets easier tho.\n\nAs for changing directions, you really can't. Unless you do it by a VERY VERY tiny amount that is still within jump range.",

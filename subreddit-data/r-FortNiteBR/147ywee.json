    "postText": "I have my nvidia control panel settings on full screen with override application settings on. And I've tried all the methods of Alt+Enter or going through settings to enable it. Whenever I try forcing fullscreen, it just reverts to windowed full screen and freezes a little bit. I've changed my gameusersettings.ini and when setting it to fullscreen mode with read only, it just stays in the top left corner of my screen like picture in picture. Even running native resolution, not stretched res it still has the same effect. I haven't had this problem before and I'm not sure why it started to happen.",

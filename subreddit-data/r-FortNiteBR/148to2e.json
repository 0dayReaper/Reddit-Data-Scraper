    "postText": "So since the newest update, I\u2019ve had a few games where I die because someone seems to stop taking damage. What I mean is, I run up to third party, and shoot a dude in the back at point-blank range with a 30 round smg. It looks like I get hit markers until the enemy\u2019s shield breaks, then nothing - it\u2019s as if my bullets just stop connecting. I don\u2019t appear to lag/clip/stutter/rubber band or anything when this happens, and it isn\u2019t *too* often, but it\u2019s frustrating when it does. Does anybody know what causes this? I think it\u2019s a bug because even though I\u2019m not the best player, I\u2019m not going to go from hitting most of my shots to missing literally everything in the span of a second.",

It would hide your head but also slow you down and presumably have truck noises playing while using it. Plays noises, so you can't hide, slow, so disadvantage by being an easier target to hit, and can't shoot or fight back without the emote turning off. Not having your head show doesn't mean shit with all that if you ask me, you're still fucked if someone catches you using the emote.",

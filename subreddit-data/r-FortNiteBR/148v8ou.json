I have watched some videos and kinda understand the lore behind Fortnite (if you wanna explain it here I would appreciate it very much ngl) But recently I saw this chalice quest but couldn\u2019t understand the story that much. Why was Aura looking for it? Why was it supposedly dangerous? Who is the gold avatar we get when we grab the chalice?",

    "postText": "I'm not sure how many of you have played apex legends before but if your game crashes or internet goes down and you're forced to leave the game it will allow you to rejoin the game in the same spot you left at and allow you to continue to play. Even if you die your teammate can pick up your banner card to respond you when you do get back.\n\nThe only reason I bring this up is because I live in a rural area and sometimes my internet connection will just drop and it'll kick me from the game. I wish we could re-join like in apex.\n\nOr do you think this would be too unbalanced for the game?",

The only way I would support it is the card reboot option otherwise it would be too easy to exploit (I drop out, and all of a sudden my solo teammate has reinforcements late game that they shouldn\u2019t)\n\nRejoin options in battle royale type games just have execution issues by nature",

            "comment": "Problem: the moment you quit, your character dies and your reboot card gets removed because you're out of the game.\n\nMeaning if you rejoin, you'd be forced to spectate for the rest of the match. Which is already how it works, and how it SHOULD work.\n\nFor Team Rumble, that's a different story, and I wouldn't be against it. It would just put you at a massive disadvantage because you'd only have starting gear (which could be somewhat balanced out by giving slightly better starting gear later on in the match).",

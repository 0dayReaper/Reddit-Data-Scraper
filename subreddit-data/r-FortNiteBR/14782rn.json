    "postText": "Whenever I change the rendering system to DX12, the game refuses to load into matches, and if it does, performance is stuttery at best. I have a perfectly competent system to be running this, (i511400 w/ rtx4070ti 16gb ram) so needless to say, I'm a bit confused. I also know that this bug doesn't affect everyone, as my friend with a lesser machine can easily run DX12.",

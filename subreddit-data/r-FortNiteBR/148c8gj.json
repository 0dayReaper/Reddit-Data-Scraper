When your squad is firing, it can\u2019t be distinguished and when you first hire an NPC you see footsteps briefly. Always freaks me out",

I used to have one member of my team using visual audio so we could tell when someone was walking 45 feet away. Lol\n\n\n\nThis is why you still see some streamers and content creators not using it, though the last one I knew about was Evolve Jake and he turned it on like 3 months ago.",

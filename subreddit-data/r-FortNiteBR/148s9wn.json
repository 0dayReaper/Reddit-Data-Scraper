I also really want a Rinzler skin. He is the last character on my list of people I want added to fortnite.",

The reason they probably haven\u2019t returned is  because people didn\u2019t like that they were lacking the actual Tron characters. I\u2019d love to have just about any from the OG cast or Legacy Cast.",

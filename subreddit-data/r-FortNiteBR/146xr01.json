And might get downvotes for this but guys... Yes fortnite is made to play however the hell you want, but don't flex on players and purposely hunt down quest doers when all you do is hug a corner and play peek-a-boo. That isn't skill. I watch sucky ass players get many many kills all the time by using wall hugging. You ain't good. If everyone played like that, no one would ever push. And honestly, you ain't pro. You wanna be? Stop spamming your \"techniques\" on people in open lobbies and play ranked. You guys play like there's money on the line and ruin people's day. I fucking love this game so much, but I'm kinda older and the tunneling edits n shit are kinda rough for me. I'm good but ain't nowhere near what seems to be the \"average\" skill for a player these days. I wanna have fun man. And most of the time I've had a bunch of beers. Y'all are cruel. The most cruel gaming community I've seen. Even cod players talk hella shit, but have genuine gamer moments and enjoy the game. I don't see that in fortnite... Just complaints and sweaty plays that seem like every single player fears for their life as if it's a pro game. It's annoying... Love y'all anyway tho. And will continue to practice.",

Both for some reason attract these type of people.\n\nSome people claim to do it to stop harassment, but in the year I've been playing this game I have never been contacted by another player in any type of way.  Neither have any of my friends or the streamers that I watch. And the only form of \"harassment\" you can get would be friend request.\n\nIts only real use is for streamers and high-ranked players to hide their names from lobby kill feed",

I can also see how it would be fair game to dupe a player by pretending to be friendly just to set up an easy kill, but that obviously won't be good for trustworthiness long-term.\n\nSo I guess all in all I'm a bit confused...they've added so much new stuff since I last played. I can see myself popping dudes in games when they're trying to pull off quests as I get back into it, but is that something I should really feel bad about?

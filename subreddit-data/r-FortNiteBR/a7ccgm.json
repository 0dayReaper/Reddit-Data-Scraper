    "postText": "We loaded in with the rest of the squad, and this kid, I guessed to be about 14, begins to ask basic questions regarding how to play the game, pretending to be a new player. So, as I always do with kids trying to troll me, I called him out:\n\n\"Let me guess, you're 14, you're the class clown and you're trying to be funny right now?\"\n\nHe pauses and an audible giggle can be heard through the mic. And after a minute of him continuing to try and fool me into believing his story, he gave up:\n\n\"Nah bro, I'm just trolling you, but honestly you guessed pretty close, I'm 13 and I am the class clown.\"\n\nSo we laughed it off and proceeded to play our squad game together. He asked if I wanted to duo with him after. \n\nWe played quite a few games together after that and learned a lot about each other. At one point he asked me: \n\n\"Do you think I'm funny?\"\n\"Yeah of course, I don't think I'd be playing with a 13 year old if I didn't think you were funny.\"\n\nHe seemed to like that. Later, he asked another question:\n\n\"Hey, did you ever like, get bullied in school?\"\n\nEverything became clear in an instant. This kid needed someone to talk to. And so we did. We talked about life for a while, his school experiences, the friends who let him down, the girls he never gets, and the bullies who have no regard for his feelings.\n\nHe told me he has a rare condition that affects his intestines and has resulted in him having parts of it removed. He explained that much of the bullying stems from this.\n\nBefore he logged off for the night he thanked me for listening and said he was glad he could talk to me about those things.\n\nNow, I don't know who this kid is, but never before have I been so emotionally touched by an encounter online. Fortnite brought me into this kid's life at just the right time, and I hope I made an impact.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm excited to hop on tonight and play with my new friend. Thank you Fortnite for facilitating this.\n\n\nTLDR; What I thought to be another kid trolling me in squads, actually became a heartfelt encounter where I learned this \"troublemaker\" was actually a kid looking for someone to care about him.\n\nEDIT: Wow, thank you for the Gold! I hope this story has touched you all as much as experiencing it has touched me. You have the power to choose love over hate. You never know what people are going through, so let's all spread kindness and love, especially in this season!\n\nEDIT 2: Dear Lord, Platinum! Blown away by you people \ud83d\ude4f\n\nEDIT 3: You guys are incredible! The stories I'm reading and messages I'm getting seriously reinforce my hope in humanity. I'm going to see what we can do for this young man, hopefully make his Christmas a memorable one!\n\nAlso, it was Hirschsprungs Disease",

During this time, I joked around a lot, had friends always around me and was the center of attention and all that crap. This one particular time I had my friends over and she kept calling and texting me. She was being really emotional and wouldn't leave it alone. I was laughing about it with my friends (these days I could never do that bullshit ever). \n\nAnyways, she starts saying suicidal things and how she doesn't want to live anymore (while also threading in how she wanted to be with me like how the conversation started yet again). I mean, she was a nice and very pretty girl overall. But thinking i was being funny, I just looked up a suicide hotline number and gave her that. Said she should call them and they'd help more than me. My only issue with it now, though, was that I laughed about it with my friends while doing it and just wanted her to leave me alone and thought it was humorous, the sending her the hotline number. \n\nDays later, she messaged me and thanked me deeply for sending her that number and \"having her call.\" She said it helped her out immensely and I was the one to thank for having her do it.\n\nI honestly felt really fucking bad about it since I could've been genuine in trying to help but instead turned it into a joke. To make it clear, I never thought the suicide was a joke. Not in the slightest. \n\nIt was just that I thought it was a ploy from her to get me to feel bad for her and talk/invite her over. So I didn't take it seriously. And I should've. That kinda stuff should never be taken lightly and you only regret it once it's too late. \n\nThat girl is now a successful local musician who seems really happy and making all her dreams come true so far. I'm happy for her. And at one point bummed I didn't take up her offer on her liking me lol. Just messing around.  I now have a wonderful, beautiful girlfriend who has saved my life 100%.\n\nDisclaimer: These days, I'm not like that at all. I have no friends, depressed, anxious and def not \"popular\" anymore. But I care so much. Life is fucking tough, esp if you make it that way. ",

I've been through things I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, but at this point I wouldn't change them even if I could.  Those experiences have made so much better, and stronger of a person, in an odd way I'm almost thankful for them.  It's taken a long time to get this point though...when you're in the middle of it, it's so hard to see past it and know that things will get better.  \nYour past is not your future...leave it where it belongs and work on being the person you want to be.

It actually is pretty crazy seeing how well she has done pursuing her music career all these years later. Thanks for the comment man!",

I'm 33 years old and I'll admit, there are times when he can be annoying (very talkative during intense situations) but more than anything, he's just a kid looking for someone to talk to and play Fortnite with. Early on he told me he was getting picked on at school for his name (honestly, the name is \"white\" but he's in a predominately white school so any deviation I guess is met with ridicule) and I told him to tell whoever made fun of him that \"I've heard better\" and walk away. It's such an easy counter to a bully, via words, that it catches them off guard. If they continue, \"I've still heard better\". You can use it endlessly.\n\nHe invites me to a xbox party to play a week or so later and tells me he used my method and \"it totally worked!\" Nearly got a tear in my eye cause I felt like proud dad.\n\nRecently, he told me his parents were getting a divorce. He's an only child, like me, and you can hear it in his voice that he's so sad about it. I told him about my parents divorcing at 18 and I didn't have someone close to turn to. I also let him know if he ever needed someone to talk to, send a party invite.",

The stuttering kid took awhile to tell us stuff and it was sometimes hard to hear him but I encouraged him to talk to us because previously he didn't like to because he often was made fun of. The other rando, as soon as the kid talked said \"t-t-today juniour\" and I snapped at him, and told him to StFu. I then proceeded to ask the kid all kinds of questions and told him to never let any difference he has bring him down. I also have a soft spot for speech problems because I had a lisp they required weekly counseling for like 10 years. ",

It turns out he was using 240hz monitor but it was set to 60hz. so i talked him through the nvidia control panel and the windows display settings to get it running at its full potential. The first game he played he said it  was as smooth as butter and felt like it was a different game. he was better than me before, now he's godly XD \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr \n\nGuy didnt have his mouse software installed and he didnt know he had a 240hz monitor. i walked him through the install and his settings so now he can play a bit faster.",

You did a good thing and you are a good person, you may have been the person just with that conversation to give him enough strength to drown out the noise and keep him from being another statistic. You tell him that bullies are bullies because they are sad inside and they don't know how to express their own emotions and that it's not his fault and he should not let it get him down. He's stronger than that and maybe one day he can pay it forward to some 13 year old kid who feels lost and helpless by bullies. GG OP",

Have fun. \n\nAs you have probably guessed I\u2019ve gained some friends from it, including a 9 year old that might be the best player I\u2019ve ever seen/played with. I think it\u2019s important to be nice to them, but some are too crazy, which is why the mute button exists. \n\nVery cool that you befriended him, hopefully you guys got a few wins for the squad!!!

Hope he remembers it like you do when he gets older.\n\nI played the first FPSs, Doom, Wolfenstein, Duke Nukem, CS, Halo, and I never thought I\u2019d be gaming with my own boy.  Fortnite was the \u00ab\u00a0new\u00a0\u00bb thing and I wanted to check it out.  After seeing him playing a bit I decided the buy a second PS4 and I set it up beside my other PS4 so we can play side by side.  \n\nIt\u2019s really special and it\u2019s the first time I actually feel old.  Trying to understand  this building aspect is hard after playing years of standard FPSs which I\u2019m pretty good at.  Yes, we grind through challenges and I might or might not buy the odd skin when he gets good marks in school, ;-). \n\nWe are at a point where we get in the top 3 in duos, and more recently solid wins.  He\u2019s really good, not in a father\u2019s opinion but as a fellow gamer.  I have to admit that he carries me a lot, but I\u2019m getting better.  We are good at communicating and amongst his friends, that we played squads, I\u2019m known as the gamer dad.  Plus that allows me to get to know his friends indirectly.\n\nI see this as the new father/son hunting trip.\n\nThanks for sharing your experience :-)",

My son came crying to me and asked me why kids were so mean. I messaged his account after the fact and told him he was a bad kid, and that he shouldnt go around bullying people but thats about all I can do. I wish I could report his gamertag for bullying but its not like Battle Royale it seems. Really makes me upset. He just wanted a friend.",

I actually didn\u2019t play for several months, and when I got back on he told me he had so many things to tell me and he felt like he didn\u2019t have anyone to talk to during that time I was off. \n\nSo interesting the connections that a video game can make. I can relate to an extent. What a world we live in....",

            "comment": "I don't play Fortnite, but my 13 year old brother does and my heart dropped when I read your post. He is exactly that kid you described. Rambunctious trouble maker in class with a jokey exterior which he uses as an obvious 13 y/o shield.  OP I think you spoke to my brother,  or someone incredibly identical to my brother, in a way I haven't been able to in a long time. Whether it is him or not, this post made me so happy to know he might be having conversation with awesome people like you.  My little brother is 11 years younger than me, 13 y/o and also had Hirschprung's, WHICH IS INCREDIBLY RARE. He was treated with multiple surgeries when he was born and had a colostomy for almost a year (hole in his stomach). However unlike what you recounted, my brother has never mentioned being bullied for his condition. That being said, I know he is a vastly misunderstood individual (i.e. he is incredibly reckless and has questionable judgement) but I always thought he was a well adjusted kid. Though, call it sisterly instinct, there's times I know he's not telling me what's really going on in his life, but I try not to pry. I think this is why your post resonated so much with me (aside from the CRAZY coincidences, damn). It felt like you wrote his story to me. Up until today I'd never even heard the disease mentioned outside the context of our family. which is another thing, the fact that you took the time to hear about it is really telling to the kindness you offered him by lending him an ear that night. I'm sorry for the wall of text but obviously this struck a chord. I also miss him a lot. Thanks for sharing and spreading the positivity. \\[and if you talk to him again, tell him his sister loves him even though she doesn't say it enough.\\]",

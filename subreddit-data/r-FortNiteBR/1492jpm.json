    "postText": "How easy would it have been to give Optimus a built in (and exclusive) glider that has him glide in as a truck (with a parachute or whatever) and have him transform into his humanoid form as he lands? \n\nIt\u2019d be cool as heck and, like, who cares- give him a giant headshot hit box as the whole cab of the truck. Anyone who wants to take on the minuscule extra risk of a bigger hit box while gliding can have a sick glider.\n\nJust me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I and thousands of others have put in time and money into this game and cannot use our accounts on the nintendo switch if we have ever signed into a PS4 console. Surely epic can keep crossplay between PS4 and switch off but allow us to use the accounts we have used for 5 seasons now.\n\nEDIT:  Epic has been active all day and chosen to ignore this post despite it being the top post.",

You also won't see their names or at least heavily filtered. It's a control issue.\n\nSony often comes with the weak excuse of having to protect what are often children from anything outside of the PSN network. As if there aren't any harassing assholes on PSN, but of course on their network they can ban assholes and claim they have control over things but with outside networks they have zero control over anything. Sony doesn't like that, apparently.\n\nThe answer to this should be; Sony needs to implement a parental control option to allow/deny cross-platform for child-accounts. They have to stop being arrogant and give people the choice and parental controls.\n\nI mean it's too little too late for me as I've already switched back to PC, but still this is ridiculous. In the end it comes down to Sony being too successful with the PS4 and they got cocky again, if Xbox was miles ahead Sony would be the one begging for cross-platform things.",

The issue is that Epic let us link our PS4 accounts without EVER ONCE warning us that we would be perma-locked console wise on that platform. I would have never linked my account knowing this because I would rather play on switch since I mostly play on PC. Epic is absolutely at some fault here, best case its a communication fault, worst case it is purposefully not informing us of this as to not dismay people from linking on PS4 and spending money in their game.",

That said, Epic are not blameless here. They didn\u2019t tell me when the game demanded I use my (pre-existing) Epic Games account in order to play Fortnite on my PS4 that doing so would lock me out of using that account anywhere but PS4, PC &amp; mobile. Had they done so, I wouldn\u2019t have done it because I would rather not have my primary Epic account be restricted like that.",

I played for 2 days and never touched a PS4 again and now you want to tell me I can't play on my switch. I was given absolutely no warning that if I were to link my account that it would be locked on other platforms or that my account would be held hostage by a company that I am not associated with. A lot of people are blamng Sony but I blame Epic as much, they are sitting there and licking Sony's ass. At the very least, they could have acknowledged this problem and replied to the affectants and said \"sorry, we are looking into the problem\" but none of it thy have kept silent much to the pelasure of the anti\\-consumer Sony.

I linked my PSN to Epic just as I've linked everything else to epic \\- it almost begs you to do so when you go to the connections page. \n\nThat being said, I've probably only played on my PS4 for a total of a few hours to play with friends before crossplay was enabled. I always play on PC \\- and not only that, every single V\\-Buck purchase I've made has been through my PC. From where I stand, it's pointless to play on my ps4 when I have much more capable PC sitting next to it. \n\nI have a Switch and I was very excited for this release because I could finally play at a friends house, or on the go, without needing to move console/pc anywhere. This also meant I could progress through my battle pass/ level up when I'm not near my PC \\- an excellent perk. I'm even more irritated because, as mentioned, I've never made a single purchase for Fortnite through PSN. I've downloaded the free skin and if they want that back, they can have it back. I don't care.\n\nI also don't care whose fault it is, really. The bottom line is there are currently 2 large companies that aren't communicating anything to their consumers, which is wrong. This post is a day old and I don't feel that we are any closer to a resolution than when this began. It's completely unfair for content I purchased on PC to be inaccessible on other my Switch because I linked my PSN. I haven't spent a single penny on Fortnite on the PSN. \n\nI've linked everything to Epic Games, including my Git. I hope this is resolved in a fair way and quickly. It's unreasonable for either Epic or Sony to be punishing players for linking an account on a whim. ",

    "postText": "While playing with the boomerang I've found a few improvements that would make it more fun to play with without making it overpowered.\n\n\n1. The boomerang turn angle should be dictated by the camera.\n\nThis would make it easier to hit players on the return flight.\n\n2. Let the boomerang hit players multiple times during flight (explosion and direct hit)\n\nThis would give the boomerang more DPS if you time the explosion right\n\n3. Allow the boomerang to be recalled instantly\n\nThis would make the boomerang feel smoother to use, especially in closer ranges.\n\n4. Half the hitbox size\n\nRight now it's barely possible to throw a boomerang through a doorway.\n\n5. Let the boomerang pick up items during it's flight\n\nThis would be a cool reference to the Legend of Zelda games where Link can use the boomerang to bring items to him. It would also add some utility to the item.\n\n6. Bring the homing down a lot.\n\nI've missed so many hits because the boomerang decided to magically curve straight into a wall.\n\n\n\nThat's about all I can think of to improve the boomerang. Let me know if you like posts like these. I may make this a series since I have lots of ideas to improve some items.",

                    "comment": "For number 3 I meant removing the ~0.5 second cooldown before you can recall the boomerang since it just makes it feel clunky to use at ~20m or less.\n\nThe boomerang right now is tons of fun, but it's not too useful as a weapon when it's homing, and massive hitbox size make you constantly hit anything but the opponent.",

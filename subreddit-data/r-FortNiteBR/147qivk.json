    "postText": "what if fortnite had ATM's that you can use to loan gold or transfer to teammates. And to pay back the loan you would have to earn the gold back but it wont be in your inventory (as if you had a negative gold count)\n\nalso the ATM would have a player account where you can deposit your gold and the max gold is 10K. You can withdraw only up to 1000 gold per match and only transfer a max of 2000 gold to teammates also per match. \n\nhere is the twist, players on the map can see all the remaining players accounts and can steal from you ONLY if you have over 7000 gold in your account and you can only steal from 1 account per match and you can take as up to 1000 gold.\n\naccounts of eliminated players are visible but are  inaccessible and the ATM's are named after midas and are from a bank called Golden Touch Reserve Bank",

Even the freaking loby songs, I have the songs on random now and everytime it plays one of the chapter 2 songs it gives me this amazing nostalgic felling.\n\nIn regards of the battle pass, I'm super curious to know who was involved in the battle pass character design for that season, and if it's the same person/team for the other  seasons as well.",

It made for some truly hilarious moments.\n\nI had played at the tail end of the first season (idek the correct terminology anymore bc I took about a 2.5 year hiatus from the game). And season 2 of chapter 1 was when I really started playing. I regret not buying the battle pass sooner and playing more of it, I wanted the floss emote so bad lol. Def some nostalgia there, but also a lot of fun times. I liked all the guns at the time, although the map was a little weak with some pretty noticeable dead spots between landing spots",

It's was great to experience that then just sit and chat about what we just witnessed and taking guesses about the next season while admiring the end screen and the calming music that went along with it.\n\nI didn't get to finish that pass and i don't use those skins very often but just seeing them in my locker brings back memories of being a fresh little player on that big island exploring every corner.\n\nEdit: was a wall of text so i adjusted it",

The super styles aren\u2019t even on the pickaxes/back blings\u2026 \n\nChapter 4 compared to every previous chapter has been lack luster, with the least amount of updates, QOL changes, meta switches, events or story. \n\nChapter 3 season 2 reinvented the entire game, while also trolling the player base by turning builds off for everyone. Chapter 4 season 2 added a bunch of OP garbage that rewarded bad players with free wins. There was essentially no story interaction other than a couple of dialogues, and only 1/6th of the map changed\u2026 Again C3, they added blimps and war zones to most POIS, the story was participating in a war, actually changed guns. \n\nIt\u2019s objective that C4 is the dryest of all chapters and you\u2019re too entertained by gimmicks to see that.",

How can you say that the gameplay didn't change at all this season ?! \n\nAs for the mythic items during C4S2, the havoc pump was OP and they had to nerf it (was still OP after that), the pulse rifle was OP and they had to nerf it too (was also still (a bit) OP after that), the force powers were super fun, but the throw ability could be a bit OP and the push one was absolutely OP at the end of the game (not complaining, I was using it too, but it was still super OP), the ODM/spideman gloves allowing players to just cross the entire map to escape, chase or third party and being completely necessary were also sort of OP, etc.\n\nAnd finally, the star wars event was definitely a real event, but I would personally not call the rest \"events\" since they were mostly battle pass quests, and often even to the detriment of the storyline.",

Felt like the culmination of the story that had been building since Chapter 2 Season 5, we finally got to see all of The Seven, as well as Zero Build being added. It also had what at this point is the most recent live event (because you can't consider Fracture a live event).\n\n3. Chapter 4\n\nAmazing theming, incredible battle pass and great map changes. Held back by the lack of changes throughout the season and the extremely convoluted story. I didn't even understand what was happening for the majority of it, even with voice acted quests. I found myself getting bored quickly and only consistently played at the start and during the Star Wars event.\n\n4. Chapter 1\n\nAnother unpopular opinion. It was good at the time, but nostalgia aside it would suck if it released today. The battle pass, while good in 2017, doesn't hold up outside of Black Knight. This season was fun because the game was brand new and nobody knew but they were doing, but take that away and you have a pretty generic season.  It also it introduced the battle pass which should be a good thing, but I partly blame this season for being the reason that a battle pass was added to every game under the sun. Dead by Daylight, Destiny 2, Overwatch 2. All of these games have pretty lacklustre battlepasses now and I can't help but say this season indirectly caused this.",

I don\u2019t entirely know why it was that season specifically, but something about that loot pool combined with the addition of zero build had me and my friends playing an insane amount, which I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d find myself saying since that season generally has mixed opinions from what I see. But I had more matches played in that season than the other chapter 3 seasons combined and they were pretty much all in squads. It almost felt like early chapter 1 fortnite where we just played for the sake of it because it was fun. We were just so into it, having specific drop spots, looting routes, making it to endgame pretty much every match and winning a good amount of them. It was an experience we hadn\u2019t had in a long time and still haven\u2019t really had since, it was one of those \u201cgood times\u201d you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re in until it\u2019s over.",

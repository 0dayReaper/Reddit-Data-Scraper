    "postText": "Whenever I get a kill, the clipping reminder does not pop up allowing me to save a clip. I also can\u2019t use the button to save at any time because it takes me to the menu/friends list. \nIs PostParty bugged at the moment or am I doing something wrong?\nI have made sure everything is linked and it still doesn\u2019t work.\nI\u2019ve also noticed that the settings for the clips is there when I log into fortnite, however, after I play a game all the settings disappear.\nI also play on PC with a Xbox Controller and use performance mode.\n\nAny help would be so appreciated as I\u2019m getting some good kills with this new season and I am absolutely loving it.",

    "postText": "I think higher ups at Epic really wanted to pull the plug on BR in favor of their metaverse. I think the plan for chapter 4 was to start with Fracture to show off what UEFN could do (barely anything big) release it immediately with chapter 4 and try to get all the hype on that, then slowly put all their resources into UEFN and let BR die out. But clearly UEFN wasn't the big success they wanted with the overwhelming majority of players in creative being in build fights that already existed before UEFN. I think Fracture to now has been a bit underwhelming in terms of new content throughout the season is because they didn't have much planned because they thought UEFN would be so much more than it turned out to be.",

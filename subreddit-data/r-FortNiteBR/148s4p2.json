Stw missions give a lot of XP, and some creative maps do as well. \n\nIf you want the quick option, there is a starter pack that costs 4 USD I believe, and that gives 600 vbucks with it. \n\nThe stw bundle quest gives 1,500 vbucks iirc, but that's the most expensive option and time consuming.",

However, there are still physical codes that can give you such pack, but I understand that some codes are for sale at high prices. So I don't know if it's worth paying a huge amount of money for the Founders pack currently...",

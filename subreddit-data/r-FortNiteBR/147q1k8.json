    "postText": "I\u2019m enjoying the new season for the most part but I haven\u2019t seen many people mention the thermal DMR\u2019s reticle. I noticed the AR\u2019s reticles are centered on screen when you ADS, but the thermal DMR is slightly off-centered. The bullets are also fired slightly to the left of the reticle, which is sort of making it hard for me to hit my shots with it. \n\nHopefully it gets patched in the weekly update!",

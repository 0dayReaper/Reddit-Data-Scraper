    "postText": "So I noticed that my cars started accelerating with the left thumb stick, and I always had the option turned off. I went to settings and even though it was off, it would still override my settings to default. \nSame thing with aim assist. \nEvery single game, I have to go in and reset all of my settings to my preference, and sometimes I have to do it multiple times with the thumb stick steering. \nI wonder what other bugs I\u2019m experiencing without noticing that are affecting my gameplay. \nEpic needs to get their shit together like wtf.",

    "postText": "As the title says, each season since Chapter 2 Season 5 we have received between 2-3 skins for this category (with the exception of Ch2 S5 and Ch3 S1, where they brought 4 characters and Ch3 S4 with just one skin) since then.\n\nTherefore that brings me doubt about what characters Epic will bring to this category this season or this will be the season in which it is not the case (although I doubt it will happen). Among the most notorious (or rather the ones I remember the most) releases we will have during this season are:\n\n- *Final Fantasy XVI on June 22*\n- *(DLC) Security Breach: Ruin on July*\n- *Exoprimal on July 14*\n- *Immortals of Aveum on July 20*\n- *Texas Chainsaw on August 18*\n\nObviously it's not all the games that will be released these 3 months and I may have made a mistake on the dates and I apologize for that\u2026\n\nSo... What do you think about this?",

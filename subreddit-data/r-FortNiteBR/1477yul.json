Yeah, the drum can feel \"OP\" against people that is scared to this weapon and only run, so they die soon or later, but if you're confidant fighting against this weapon, it sucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA vault? A nerf? Well, I don't care having the havoc pump in the same lootpool",

It doesn't even fit the seasons theme, if they needed to unvault a shotgun they could use the lever action, or even the primal (I know it's just a burst drum gun but it'd fit the theme)\n\nAnd why it the flying island mythic???

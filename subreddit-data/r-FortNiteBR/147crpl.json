That's why Web3 is either going to be the next big thing or totally useless.",

The strategy behind the item shop is to take things away and readd them so you feel like you need to have a stash of vbucks available to make purchases immediately, then they created an interface that made it easy to accidentally spend your saved up vbucks. \n\nIt's in court filings, so it's not really debated.",

We\u2019ve had plenty shops where all the Marvel cosmetics are in except Venom and the Spidermen because they\u2019re Sony property. Especially since Miles and Miguel are from a complete separate story from Tom\u2019s Spiderman and the rest of the MCU, idk if we can expect their return",

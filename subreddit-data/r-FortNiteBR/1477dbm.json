Even if you get the augments for the DMR to reduce recoil and gain bloodhound, so what?

The flap Jack is really overpowered, until you have to reload it during a firefight, for that reason I still think I\u2019d rather have the havoc ar. Same sort of issue comes along with the drum shotty, if you find yourself in a multiple person firefight and have to reload that thing, you\u2019re gonna have to have something else in your loadout good for an up close fight, for that reason, again, I think I\u2019d rather still carry the havoc pump",

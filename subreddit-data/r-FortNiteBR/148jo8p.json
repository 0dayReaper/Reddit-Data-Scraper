The lack of a clear head  placement what does is reduce the potential time to kill by a significant margin,hell some weapons like snipers can one shot you if you manage to land a hit on their head,which could totally make a difference in any firefight. \n\n\nThe fact that you for some reason cannot think of any scenario where  this could make a difference tells me that either people in your games aren't good enough to land headshots on stationary targets or that you are being intentionally dense.\n\n\n&gt;Trying to use it mid fight would likely have you dead before the transformation animation even finished.\n\nNobody will emote mid fight intentionally,but plenty of people have emoted after winning a fight,or when they think they are alone with their teammates, why should the ones using this emote have an advantage over the people using the dozens of other emotes available in game ?",

    "postText": "Been having this issue for the past couple of weeks, it seems fortnite is having an issue with the anti-chest software because it says it\u2019s not installed but definitely is. I have tried every solution I can find online and nothing works. Yesterday I was able to play after the update and today no luck for the past 3 hours. I\u2019ve tried a clean installation, repairing the service, creating a shortcut, literally everything to disabling my firewall. If anyone has a solution please help",

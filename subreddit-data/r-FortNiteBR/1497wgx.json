    "postText": "I saw some comments that some people wanted more WWE skins. Here's what that should look like.\n\nFirst, D-Generation X, with Triple H and Shawn Michaels (the main members). No back bling, green glowsticks pickaxe (with an emote where they make the X symbol with them), a tank glider, a wrap with an animated DX symbol, a \"Break It Down\" lobby track, and an X symbol contrail. Also, both DX and non-DX edit styles for the skins.\n\nSecond, the Outsiders (Scott Hall and Kevin Nash). With an nWo 4 Lyfe hand emote, nWo championship belt pickaxe, animated/reactive nWo wrap, and Hulk Hogan's black and white glasses as the glider. Also a \"Rockhouse\" lobby track.\n\nThird, the Bloodline with Roman Reigns (both Shield and Tribal Chief edit styles), The Usos (2014 and Bloodline edit styles) and Solo Sikoa. Roman Reigns with a built in \"Locked and Loaded\" emote where he readys his hand for a superman punch (hard to explain). Also an \"Acknowledgement\" emote where the character puts their 1 finger up in acknowledgement of the Tribal Chief. Complete with the Undisputed Championship belt pickaxe and backbling (with dual WWE and Universal Championship edit style), the tag team title pickaxe and back bling, \"Tribal Tattoos\" wrap and contrail (basically their tattoo designs), and the \"Island of Relevancy\" glider where the character surfs on a trophy with the number 1 on it. Also, a \"Head of the Table\" (Reigns), \"Done With That\" (Usos), and \"Taking It All\" (Sikoa) lobby track.\n\nFourth, the Undertaker (both Deadman and Big Evil/American Badass edit styles), with an urn back bling and the Undertaker's symbol back bling, gravestone pickaxe, the \"Deadman's Throne\" (Undertaker's throne) and a wrap that shows his animated titantron with the moon on it.\n\nAnd, finally Seth Rollins (2015-2017 edit styles, the Monday Night Messiah edit style, and the Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins/Visionary edit style). Comes with a World Heavyweight Championship back bling World Heavyweight Championship pickaxe, Money in the Bank 2014 briefcase glider (with money hanging out of it, like Brutus's glider), Burn It Down wrap with fire on it, and a built in emote where Rollins does his signature dance while \"Visionary\" plays in the background. Also, a \"The Second Coming\" and \"Visionary\" lobby track.",

Austin 3:16 T-Shirt as an alternative.\n\nGlider could the Stone Cold ATV he drives around the ring every now and then.\n\nBack bling could be the smoking skull WWF belt.\n\nPick axe could be a steel chair. \n\nBuilt in e-mote would have to be a beer bash (maybe soda bash if alcohol isn't allowed)",

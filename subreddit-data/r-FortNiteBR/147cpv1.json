    "postText": "BRs blow up in popularity with PUBG and H1Z1. People complain about getting shot in the open with no cover. Fortnite comes around with building and it's perfect. Turbo building is added and the skill ceiling shoots up. It gets to a point where people are leaving because of how impossible it is to compete with skilled players. Zero-builds is added and people are happy. People start wanting the ability to place cover with port-a-forts and port-a-bunkers. Now wouldn't it be crazy if we could build our own structures like walls, floors, and stairs?",

            "comment": "i feel like build mode these days just has a too high of a barrier of entry skill wise, which is mostly because smbb has never been implemented properly. hopefully when ranked is tweaked throughout season 0/1 we will see zb players come back to builds if they get in the lobbies they belong in, with opponents at THEIR skill level, and actually have fun.",

I've pretty much never played on controller, and within two weeks of playing team rumble I've learned 90s, single cone edits and how to box and edit. A majority of it is understanding the fundamentals. Once you know them, the mechs will come.",

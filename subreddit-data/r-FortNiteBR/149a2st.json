It's the current map, you can enter in private game with maximum 8 people https://www.fortnite.com/creative/island-codes/9029-3610-0228\n\nSometimes it comes back as an official LTM by Epic where more settings are available but currently it's just the map on its own.",

She could play creative games with people who are better but she\u2019ll respawn or you can do creative maps that help you learn there is no way to go back to older battle Royale maps",

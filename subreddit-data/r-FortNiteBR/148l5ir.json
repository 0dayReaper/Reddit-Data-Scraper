When y'all play duos trios or squads, do you guys abide by whoever kills a player gets that players loot or if that player you killed had a crown, should that crown go to the team member that killer them? \n\nI'm curious because when I played with this one squad the other night, they've never heard of that concept and they constantly stole my stuff and hogged the heals and even took a crown from me \ud83e\udd72 (crowns are over rated anyways)\n\nI typically run mostly duos with my cousin and we usually are more courteous in that aspect to each other and that's how we have always played.  \n\nBut really I want to know if y'all have a general consensus when you play with your squad or have any unspoken rules.",

Whoever makes the kill usually gets there first and gets first choice but we ask each other if we can have stuff and check in on what everyone has. We share ammo too based on who has what gun. Like we\u2019re not going to leave one person with grey weapons and one person with all gold, and if at the beginning of the match one person has a full load out and there\u2019s a teammate who\u2019s found nothing, we\u2019ll drop weapons to share. \n\nPlaying with randoms is just a crapshoot. You have to remember that there are a lot of children and teenagers playing this game that just don\u2019t have the maturity yet to play well with a team. It\u2019s hard to accept not having the best stuff and forcing the best outcome for yourself at first when your brains risk/reward center isn\u2019t fully developed lol",

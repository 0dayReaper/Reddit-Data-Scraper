You blend in so perfectly with skins like Poison Ivy, green superhero skins, Chris Redfield (RE5) and basically all the default skins. \n\nIts super fun though, since its harder to spot enemies and you need to flush them out either with your equipment or working strategically as a Team.\n\nBut there are also alot of campers and Teams that sit in the bushes to ambush you. \n\nAnd in this one round we were hunted down by Players who all used the Predator skin and it was fantastic! \n\nThe new biomes are well done, but with any green/camouflaged skin you have a huge advantage over your opponents.",

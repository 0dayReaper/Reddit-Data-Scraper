However, the seasons with the blimps, and later with the flying buildings had that what I liked in chapter 1. \n\nWhat I really like about the Ch1 and Ch4 map are the STEEP edges where you cannot simply walk up to (except with ziplines). They make good positioning much more relevant. And especially in Ch4 they offer great cover which naturally looking hills do not do.\n\nMaybe I did not express myself clearly\u2026 Yes, there were some hills and mountains on the Ch2 map, but except of a few of them, there was barely any impact on the gameplay. When you went from Holly Hedges to Dirty Docks, you would barely have any significant hight differences. There was no way to stay on the high ground against better builders.",

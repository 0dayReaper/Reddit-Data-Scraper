    "postText": "I\u2019m having the hardest time finding GOOD weapons/items in other areas outside of the new POI. There\u2019s A LOT of uncommon weapons, very few large shield pots (which I\u2019ve noticed are bunched up in random areas when I\u2019m roaming the map), and the mythic item is relatively hard to locate. \n\nThis is probably to get players to drop in the new POI. I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want to drop where 99% of the other players are going to. It just doesn\u2019t sound adroit. \n\nI hope they make the drop rates better soon.",

Struggling to even find shields.\n\nNext game. Landed in biome. Snagged a blue and cybertron cannon as floor loot. Every other chest was a big pot. Milk and honey.\n\n![gif](giphy|hpL093ILXQaSZF8DOa)",

    "postText": "Never had this issue until last night, but character skins are taking a long time to load in, ESPECIALLY my own skin (Isaac Clarke if it matters)\n\nIm a muddy blurry mess in the lobby permanently, and it takes five+ minutes in match for my skin to unblur. Its VERY annoying how ugly it is.\n\nHas anyone else had more issues with skins loading in slowly lately? I have all my current nvidia drivers up to date, have an fps cap, am in full screen windowed (i tried plain full screen too) and nothing seems to help?",

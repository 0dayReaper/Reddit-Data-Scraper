If I can safely rez someone without being myself killed, I don't see why not.\n\nYet in another game I happened to get sniped and knocked down with 2 of my teammates literally RIGHT beside me and they just jumped around me instead of rezzing.  \nAnother teammate from farther away came running in to save me before I died.  \n\nI love 50/50 but some people love to try and ruin it with this type of shit.  \n\nI've seen people try to create huge ramps to place jump pads on only for teammates to shoot down the ramp so they fall to their death before they can place the pad. Like fuck off.  \n",

Hopefully next time they do a game mode similar to this they implement something similar to GTA:O and their 'poor sport' pool. The kill feed already recognizes when a friendly knocks a friendly with fall damage. Identify repeat offenders and flag them to be queued into a server with like minded players. Doesn't fix the loot pirating but it fixes one of the major gripes I have with the current mode.\n",

Once you have that down it seems pretty intuitive as long as you remember that with stairs you select what you want to keep instead of walls where you select what you want removed. Hope that helps! Add me on xbox (same username/gamertag) if you want, I'm always looking for new people to play with! ",

It's incredibly frustrating when you and your squadmates clearly communicate and mark a specific landing spot, but a random teammate decides to go off on their own, lands far away, and ends up getting eliminated almost immediately. It's even more disappointing when they disconnect shortly after, leaving your squad at a disadvantage. It can really disrupt the teamwork and coordination that's essential for a successful squad match.",

I have really bad anxiety and I'm autistic, so as y'all can imagine\u2014 it's already a bit of a challenge for me to talk to people sometimes. The FN player base definitely isn't super kind to people like me. Thankfully I've had some really awesome people on mic in fills who helped me open up, but that doesn't take away from some really fucked up experiences I've had on mic. I've had people mock my voice, people mocking the way I speak (I'm not always clear and have a bit of a stutter), and on the rare occasion I'm not mistaken for a guy (which I'm fine with ofc)\u2014 I've had so much flak for just being a girl on the game.\n\n\nWorst experience genuinely has to be back in chapter 2 where a squad full of male players ( consisted of I want to say based off their voices an 8-10 yr. old, a 12-15 yr. old, and a 25-30 yr. old) making incredibly sexist, vulgar, and disturbingly sexual comments towards me. At the time I always felt bad about leaving my team, so I just stayed until the game crashed. I didn't get on for the rest of the night or day after aside for a few matches with my dad and some friends. I remember I started crying, I felt sick to my stomach, and just on the verge of a panic attack. I know it's probably stupid to get upset over, but I never would have imagined any single person talking to me the way they did\u2014 let alone 3. It seriously fucked me up for a while and genuinely made me dread playing the game outside of people I knew for a while. Thankfully I never had a bad encounter like that since then, a few sour ones but nothing as horrible as that. Plus since then I've gotten more confident in leaving when I need to and even shutting people down.\n\n\nI get communication is important, but sometimes you gotta adapt to the fact not everyone can or wants to talk. There's people like me who are just not fully trustful of players, there's people who may be literally cannot talk in the moment because of things in their environment, or people who can't/don't talk because of something going on with them that causes it (for example, people who are mute or have selective mutism). Hell\u2014 what about the times you've been paired with a player who does talk but not in a language you can understand? Are you gonna leave still because you don't get what they're saying? I hate people who do this, just because you can't hear your teammates doesn't mean there's no form of communication. There's emojis, emotes, the ping system. Hell, a lot of people just kinda forgot they expanded upon it back in late chapter 3 to make non-verbal communication better. It's there for a reason ya know!\n\n\nAnyways, sorry for the tangent. I just needed to get this out on the topic. As nice as it is to be able to, you are not entitled to verbal communication from anybody in the game. *Get over it and deal with it.*",

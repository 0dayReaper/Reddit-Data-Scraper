My least favorite are the people who play music through crunchy microphones they got on Wish. I mute those players as soon as I have a chance to access the menus without getting beamed. \n\nI take that back\u2026 my least favorite are the ones who have pretend conversations with pretend girls on their pretend cell phones. I don\u2019t know why randoms can be so cringey.",

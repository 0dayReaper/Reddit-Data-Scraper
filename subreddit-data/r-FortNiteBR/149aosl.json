I never felt comfortable with it on controller, I recently switched to mouse and keyboard and feel the same way.\n\n  \nTo me it's one of the worst auto shotguns we've ever had. Small mag size, slow fire rate, huge spread, its only good if you're right in their face (but so is almost everything)\n\n  \nThere's no doubt the gold and purple ones are pretty good, and the Heisted Accelerant is one of the greatest shotguns ever, but overall im not sure how the Maven still fits in the lootpool  \n\n\nI think personally a better loot pool would be the Drum Shotgun, Havoc Pump Shotgun, and the Combat Shotgun for its added range and tight spread.\n\n  \nThe Maven as it stands, with the exception of the Exotic, is kinda like the Drum from wish. I see no reason to use it over the drum (unless its the exotic)\n\n  \nThoughts? I never got along with the Maven, but I know others have liked it!",

For a set price (same price everyday) u get three items, which are shown to you before buying. It is updated daily. There are typically 2 bundles per day, sometimes 3. I think this is a good idea. \n\nThis brings in extra sales. If you probably didn\u2019t buy a skin already when it came out, you probably don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the price so you\u2019ll never buy it. Now if u see it in a bundle with 2 other items, this might incline you to buy the bundle. Now you bought the bundle and they made money. \n\nThe main counterargument is that \u201cthey lose money with the bundle\u201d. Not really. Like i said above, you were probably ever gonna buy that skin. So they made 0 dollars off you. With the bundle, they get the cost of the bundle. ",

They refunded the purchase for her and the vbucks didn't go away immediately. The funniest part was that my brother though he lucked out then 2 days later he sends me a pic of his 200 vbuck balance and said even the skins were taken away",

It feels weird for him to be spending real money on decorative stuff in his game.\n\nI guess my question is this, for those of you who play and know the culture better: are custom skins critical to the enjoyment of the game? Is he likely to catch a lot of flak for just having basic stuff?\n\nHe spent like an hour showing me all his shiny equipment in Zelda BOTW before he got into Fortnite, so I know it makes him feel proud...",

Sometimes there's a $5 package the get you a skin (character) and 600 vbucks, otherwise they sell in $10 (1000) 25 (2800) 50 (6000) or 100 (12000) packages. The $25 will get him the season pass AND have enough left over for an EPIC (common, rare, epic, legendary are the levels of the skins, no bonuses for them but they're fancier,though it's all a matter of preference).\n I figure the game is free, $25 goes a long way by means of in-game stuff, and based off how my son is, having a skin you like will def improve his overall game experience. \n\nHe can still enjoy the game without the pass, but once I got mine, it took the game from \"it's okay\" to \"awesome\".

Obviously, I don't know all the details of you, your son, and Fortnite.\n\nAs others have said, if you allow him one battle pass, he is able to earn vbucks by simply completing the pass. I'm not exactly sure of the amount you gain, but I know that it is enough to buy next season's pass, plus a little more. With a single pass, he is able to keep buying battle passes forever, and also is able to save up extra vbucks over time for non battle pass items that may catch his eye.\n\nAlso, if he doesn't know yet, this could be a great way to introduce him to money handling! He has to spend his vbucks wisely, because if not, he won't be able to buy things in the future. Ask him every once in a while if he bought anything in Fortnite, and then see if he ever asks for vbucks again. If you see that he is not saving enough vbucks for the next battlepass, make it a lesson for him and then continue on as you would see fit (buy him enough for ONE more pass, or maybe disallow him from buying vbucks period, or whatever you think is best).\n\nWhile these in game items do not provide any advantage (hell, some provide DISadvantages because of their bright colors or large sizes), not having them can sometimes net in some negativity from people. A portion of the (mostly younger) playerbase can be toxic towards people that don't have any cosmetic items. Of course, a workaround for this would be to disable voice chat for random players, but if your son is playing with friends of his that have, say 2000-vbuck skins, when your son has nothing, some teasing could definitely arise. It's nice to have *something* in game, even if its something that most people have, like battle pass items. And because battle pass items have to be earned, rather than bought, your son has something to work towards, and can feel accomplished when he gets that tier 100 werewolf skin :)\n\nFortnite also has another (albeit much less popular) game mode, called Save the World. It's a game focused around defending and completing objectives with 4 people (though it can be done alone as well!), against zombie-like creatures called Husks. The game can be found for pretty cheap if you look in the right places (I was able to get my copy for $10 but shh don't tell anyone), and it pays for itself pretty fast if your son puts enough time into it. By simply playing through the first few portions of the game, he can bring in a pretty healthy amount of vbucks, which can be used in battle royale. \n\nThere's daily login rewards (all he has to do is log in to the game and log back out), and rewards for completing missions. If you do enough of them, you definitely won't have to worry about running low on vbucks. I have not had to spend a dime on vbucks for well over 5-6 months, because of Save the World. I've spent almost 3000 vbucks in the past 2 weeks alone, and I am already more than halfway done earning them back, with around 1-2 hours of playtime per day.\n\nPersonally speaking, Save the World is a blast. When I get annoyed with battle royale, or am just not feeling like playing it, Save the World is a more chilled-out alternative, in the same package. If you find your son getting angry over battle royale, Save the World is also a great way to cool down.\n\nHope this helps!",

I believe it's only 950 V-bucks and the more the level it up in game you unlock a wide array of skins, cosmetics etc you get to keep forever. This way he can enjoy a tonne of items instead of spending 950 on JUST 1 skin from the shop.\n\nCosmetics give no advantage in game, they are purely for fun and other players shouldn't judge you based on what skin you have. I've purposely donned the starter stuff (think it's called \"no skin\") and only had a few people (mostly children) ask nicely why I don't have a skin.",

Scarcity creates demand. The longer that Epic goes without making a skin available again, the more coveted it is. Sadly, all that this would result in is a massive payday for Epic, followed by diminishing returns. It is in their interest to make skins scarce, because it leads to more impulse purchases when they are eventually released. ",

There is a strong psychological component in Fortnite's randomness (skins, chests, etc.).\n\n\nSure, they would get a lot of sales all at once... but if they tease you with constant 24-hour sales, they will actually make more in the long run (and keep demand high). \n\n\nThink about retail stores - they have sales for certain items... but usually a Fire Sale (i.e. everything at once) only happens when they are going out of business, and thus don't have a hope of extending profits into the future.",

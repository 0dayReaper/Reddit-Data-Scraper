Everyone hides in bushes, plants, and are fully hidden in trees but see me with perfect clarity.\n\nAnd ofc no matter what, every game I've played has a mid/end game zone with the jungle because it's the new thing.\n\nThis may genuinely be the worst biome addition ever. Primal was a shit season but at least the map changes weren't as bad as this.\n\nInb4 PC/switch players with performance mode on say \"I can see fine\" lmao",

Three season ago.  \nIt honestly is a nice experience to not have an insane hammer, deku smash, kamehameha, odm, swinging, insane traversal items. Now it feels more like a zany battle royale game.  \n\n\nForces team work, more tactical thinking. My brothers cant run offf randomly because they can't magically re-appear. Its enfuriating when they try though. instant 1vs3 means im dead most of the time. But I can hide at least lol. Feel like rambo. It's a nice experience and change of pace even if its for couple of weeks.  \n\n\nalso removing chug splash forces me to use other healing items which is nice.  I only got those cuz they healed whole team. was superior healing item in most cases",

Having a healing item that you can fling while running/moving that heals both shields and your entire team at once is broken af.  \n\n\nIn real world gun fighting terrain is used to hide. No one falls from the sky into open fields and shoots each other. So learn wtf balance really is",

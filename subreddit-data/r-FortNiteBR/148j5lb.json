    "postText": "Now for long range im forced to either pick up a thermal dmr with no hitscan like red eye , or a sniper , or try \u201c bursting \u201c with the mk , there was nothing wrong with the red eye and favored people with good aim. Some changes epic does really has me scratching my chin sometimes. Red eye was my savior , thats my end rant hope everyone else feels the same so we can get it back just like how they took out trios and we got it back",

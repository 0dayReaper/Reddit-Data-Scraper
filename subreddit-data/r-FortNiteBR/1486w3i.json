    "postText": "I think it would be interesting if Epic made a season called something like Legends of the Battle Pass. In this season the map would go back to the first ever map of Fortnite, from day one with all the original guns. Then the Battle Pass is customizable where players can select skins that they missed. So for example someone would select a skin at level 100 from the previous level 100\u2019s offered. \n\nWould the season be completely nostalgia driven? Hell yea. Would it sell really well with old and new fans? For sure.",

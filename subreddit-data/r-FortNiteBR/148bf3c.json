What's wierd is that all the textures, buildings and so on load perfectly fine in the distance, it's only things like the vegetation (new biome specifically, regular vegetation still could load from a further distance, but it's not spawning in my face) and these ground rocks that seem to load wierd.",

Gives me an idea of how yours will perform.  \n\n\nI turned up everything to the highest. Turned everything on. Yeah, it looked insanely more good than I already had it. However; it shot up from 6gigs of v-ram to 8.6 gigs of v-ram.  \n\n\nYour card cannot handle everything turned on to the highest. I was experiencing drop in frames here and there sometimes. eventually it stuck to 56fps. And I limit my display to 1080p and 60fps. More constant this way.  \n\n\nI would recommend changing everything you have to just High Settings.  \nAnti-ailiasing and Super resolution tab to = TSR Medium  \n\n\nGeometry off.   \n\n\nThis made the card run at 6.5 vram which yours will handle well. you never want to really use all your vram up. Always leave at least a gig of vram open incase other things running need it for some random reason. The more you use, the hotter i gets, the more it will slow it self down to keep cool.   \n\n\nThis made the graphics load better as I was playing after a minute. maybe it will help you too a bit",

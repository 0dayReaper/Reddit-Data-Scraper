The only think OP could've added more to this is a comparison to normal travel  apeed I guess but that's not really needed. Besides, we still have cars, bikes, and dinos for mobility as well as the new vines and mushrooms. Also I'm pretty sure OP IS having fun. If they weren't, this would've been a complaint post",

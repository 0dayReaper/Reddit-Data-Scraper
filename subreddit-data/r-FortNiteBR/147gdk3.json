For ZB specifically, you can get the high ground, have all your utility, and will lose most of the time to a player(s) in a very mediocre spot wherever zone is. I am talking the last couple zones.

The biggest problem for no mobility is storm and even if your squad is playing to minimize the risk there is always a chance you encounter a squad who can't resist the mistake of engaging instead of playing for zone and even if they prevail odds are most or all of that squad succumb to storm. You're left with a no win prop. Fight them, and if you win you likely succumb to storm or don't fight them and get shot in the back and get eliminated.",

The game would benefit a little more of having those jumping plants more around the map, or more speed plants/kegs that you can destroy and that would be enough for me. \n\nThe problem with less mobility stays in no-build when you're on the wrong part of the map. Having high ground is such a huge advantage and sometimes you're just unlucky and the enemy team to have a smooth way to go to the high ground while you have nothing to do but rotate weirdly and put yourself to the risk.",

These things will make you a better player in the long run.\n\nAnd if you are being honest it wasnt all aggression and there were many times you used the mobility to run away from a bad situation.\n\nI feel like your post has said that the lack of mobility has made it harder but you sound like you are up for the new challenge.",

Now at least there are *some* options. \n\nThat being said, I think they expected at least the Katana to be in the game at this point because all the Japanese biomes are still there as well as the dueling grounds.

Or worse when the zip line just doesn\u2019t give the immunity at all and you jump off to shoot someone below you but end up super low from fall damage you shouldn\u2019t have taken. If they can\u2019t fix the bugs that cause that, then make aerialist more common or bring back hop rock dualies. Anything to allow safe descents",

Some of us want mobility to engage fights, not run away from them. All of these items, particularly the sword, provided the ability to change position and create misdirection and reset fights. They don't even remotely guarantee escape or victory. Running away is an inescapable part of their usefulness, but most are wildly exaggerating with talk of \"infinite\" mobility and the ability to traverse the full map in \"seconds.\" You can shoot somebody who is running away and they take fall damage; or, if you have the item as well you can give chase. So there is plenty of balance and counter. The only time that I was ever pulling out gear and running with \"5 hp\" left is when somebody was third partying me. Everyone's opinion on this is determined by how they choose to play the game. I miss mobility because it allowed me to be more aggressive, not less.",

I remember when I saw here on reddit and then tried in the game and won a few matches because the other guys would be hiding behind trees or running towards my base trying to shoot me. It was so good to be one level up most people.  \nSince then, I never could change from the default controls in PS4 and get recked by people. I still do good, I can build good as well but I know I'd improve so much with Builder Pro but it disgusts me having to change every muscular memory I've built the last 7 months or more..",

That way, building would still be important, but you'd have to plan ahead more and play smart with where you place structures and when you decide to build. Just an idea. \n",

Its actually not that hard to do at all.\n",

    "postText": "Remember when you could zoom in on the map, close the map, and when you opened it back up it was still zoomed in? Yeah me too. So why can\u2019t we do that anymore?\n\nIt feels like this bug/change has been in the game now for weeks or even months, and absolutely no one is bringing it up. \n\nIt\u2019s so annoying to be in the late game, and having to waste time zooming in on the map every time you look at it, just to see where you should be. \n\nWhy is no one talking about this? It\u2019s extremely frustrating and I can\u2019t not talk about it anymore. It needs to be restored to how it was.",

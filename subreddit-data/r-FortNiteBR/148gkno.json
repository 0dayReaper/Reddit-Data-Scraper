In contrast, a projectile-based weapon would launch an actual projectile object that moves through the virtual space at a certain speed and will apply damage only once it has actually touched (\"hit\") a target.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically no bullet drop or travel time. The red eye is hitscan, dmr is projectile.",

    "postText": "At this point it is beyond fucking ridiculous.  I land shit damage shotgun shots over and over and over, and they are good placed shots, almost perfectly placed tbh, yet every controller player easily lands max damage shots OVER AND OVER AND OVER.  I thought what the hell, lets try ps5, it is so blatantly bad, that on ps5, I can have horseshit shots and they still land for huge damage.  I have been hit over 100 almost every single shot today by controller players, yet I can only land maybe 1 in 10 shots, YET 9 out of 10 shots I get hit by, from a controller players is max or near max damage, ITS GETTING FUCKING OLD.  Basically at this point I am done with Epic and their mickey mouse catering to controller players.  Fuck fortnite.",

There\u2019s a reason why almost every pro is on KBM. 100% a skill issue. Let me ask, do you mostly ADS with shotgun or hipfire? I have a friend who complains about aim assist on fortnite but he uses ADS in every gunfight making it hard for him to hit sweaty players who are bunny jumping.",

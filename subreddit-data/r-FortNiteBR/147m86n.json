    "postText": "A lot of people have been disappointed with the Kinetic Boomerangs lack of mobility, however to compensate for this it seems like it can go through all structures when recalled. With this, you can hit people inside boxes without even breaking the wall. It takes some skill to line up the boomerang, but being able to hit people in a box without them being able to do anything about it seems invaluable.",

Why would we have thought a sword would allow us to fly? In fact, a boomerang is the only thing of any of the chapter 4 kinetic items that does fly. \n\nOff the top of my head: You could throw it and at any point along the rounded flight path you could press a button and zip to that spot (right now the secondary button press detonates it).",

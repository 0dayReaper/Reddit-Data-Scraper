    "postText": "I've been watching my flatmate play the game, and I know the difference between blue shield, white health, and yellow headshot damage. Still, I'm confused, as I see him frequently burn through shields and hit other players for 110 white health damage (particularly with the Cybertron cannon) yet his opponents survive. Why doesn't this one-shot people? (He's got no clue either. He plays, but spends no time on wikis or forums.) Cheers!",

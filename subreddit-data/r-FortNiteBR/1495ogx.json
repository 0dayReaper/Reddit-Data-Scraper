    "postText": "I don't love augments. Often times I'm just picking whatever. Some are useful, some fun, etc.\n\nThinking about other BR games, there is the mechanic of not only finding new weapons but also attachments and upgrades. I think Epic should switch augments to weapon modification options.\n\nYou could have builds focused on speed, power, bunker breaking, distance, etc.\n\nOne downside is it couldn't be weapon specific, because you basically throw away an augment if you upgrade a weapon and drop it. It would have to be weapon type specific, which is more limiting.\n\nOtherwise, just introducing a weapon upgrade / attachment system like COD and Apex would be a lot of fun, especially with the whacky stuff the Fortnite devs think up.",

            "comment": "But a lot of them are not weapon enhancements though. \n\nYou gotta look at them in a hierarchy like with heal/shields. What's first, second, third priority? \n\nAnd they do tend to allow for what you want to do. W keyer who like to do the swap? Run soaring sprints, shotgun striker, light fingers, shotgun reload one.\n\nIf you want to run an ar along with the pancake as the spray weapon you can run reckless, med ammo acquired, first assault.\n\nLast season you could run bloodhound, steady Hands, and Bush warrior if you like the stealthy camping playstyle.\n\nStart also looking at them as enhancements not attachments and they make more sense.",

I'm just saying something a bit more direct, like in some of my other replies. \n\nThe faster reload on empty AR augment is a good example of them going in the right direction, IMO. Not soaring sprint, lol.",

I don't see it as a complication with Apex, but rather something that draws me to it. \nAnd I'd argue gun attachments can augment play style, 100%. Especially with what Fortnite can come up with. \n\nHeck maybe they could add what I'm talking about in a different capacity and keep the augments as is now. Could have some interesting combinations, what augment works well with what gun mod. \nThen if you don't want a gun attachment, don't grab it! Focus on augments that effect the player",

I logged in yesterday night to get my new STW quest, and when I login this morning (after daily quests bonuses have refreshed for the battle pass), no new STW quest. So I sometimes miss out on my STW daily quest.  \n\n\nI need to know when I need to login by to secure a daily quest, without missing the next day's.",

    "postText": "When you see the first circle come up, ping it. See how far you should run, if its anything higher then 500 rotate before the process begins closing. Because (not sprinting) it will take you 166 seconds to travel that distance on foot. Always check how much damage the storm will do (its on the map) and what circle is coming back. If I remember correctly moving circles start at 5th zone with half and half and the next circles fully move. \n\nWe live without mobility in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, we can live without it now. Instead of fighting rotate early and get a good spot. Also if your team isn't rotating, ping where you want to go on the map and leave them. You will die way more storm fighting and there's no siphon in game to bail you out. Good luck on the battle bus.",

Loot away, but be mindful that you've got 1-2 minutes, tops, to loot before you need to get going.  Give yourself 1 minute each circle thereafter to loot in your new locale and keep going.\n\nWhenever you stop to loot, have a storm escape plan.",

All they need to do is read posts like yours, adapt, and they'll be fine. Plus, imo the storm is really forgiving for the first four phases and getting caught in it isn't that big of a deal as long as you can either stay out of fights or end them quickly.",

We used to have none of that. \n\nPeople need to learn how to play the storm and use it to their advantage. One of my oldest tactics w/ fortnite has been to land on the outskirts of the map and ride the storm in as it closes. It cuts off a good portion of map I can be attacked from and I'm always on the lookout to move in. Can get top 15 quite consistently if not top 5",

Time after time I got into decent positions last season, got the drop on people only to end up having a 10 minute chase sequence that culminates in getting 3rd partied 700m away from where I got the drop on someone. \n\nWith no mobility it's much harder to do that and as a result teams are getting punished for making poor decisions in games.",

Your goal is to quickly think what happened, what can I do, and what are they doing. They expect you to be scared, go on the defensive, but and I repeat do not just focus on running. Try for example to do a little bit of damage, this will stop over aggro playstyles\n\nand finally, if you know you cant kill them, dont push. I'm not saying to hide, but so many bad players I fight just walk up to my wall and start pickaxing trying to replace it, or just box. When I play zero build (once in every blue moon) I see players do the same thing, just run at you. Look at your opponent, if they are clearly good, and are in a good position to kill you. STOP AND TURN AWAY.",

I think we need (some type) of mobility items. For people who can\u2019t adapt to the fact that there is no web shooters or ODM gear, that just shows how many privelged players there are, however on the flip side of the coin i do think in 2023 and with this specific map we should have some mobility item options available. (I\u2019m not doscounting the mobility that is already built into the map), because early to mid game there is no excuse, we got cars, geysers, mud, vines, rails, zip lines, launch pads, rifts, dinosaurs, augments, and the simple fact that we can sprint and slide (game used to have none of these). But again on the other side of the coin i think late game, with the way this map is shaped with all the cliffs, there should be something like a simple stack of shockwaves or shadow bombs.",

I\u2019ve played fortnite since the very beginning and I don\u2019t remember the late game circles moving this fast. Usually when the storm starts hitting for 5 it becomes slower and easier to outrun but lately when I try to rotate to the circle in ranked if I get in a single fight the circle will already be moving and even if I win the fight quickly I won\u2019t be able to catch up with the circle. Back in the day I\u2019d rotate and avoid the fight by building but in zero build with no movement you have to take the fight most the time and can never catch up. We always used to have shockwaves, bounce pads, launch pads, and seasonal items to move faster. So I get the argument to just rotate earlier but when the circles starts moving every 40 seconds and you have to take a fight, revive a teammate, and heal it becomes impossible for the winner of a fight to keep up with the circle.",

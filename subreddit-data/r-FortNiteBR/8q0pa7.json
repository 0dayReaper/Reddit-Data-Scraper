This opens up room for a ton of story possibilities and lets them break out of the problem most comic book movies have-- the heroes are so powerful that only a world or galaxy threatening villain justifies their presence and most such villains are really flat (among many others, Thor: The Dark World).  So they took this cool concept and gave the team... a completely flat world-threatening villain.  \n\nAbsurd on the face of it.  It should have been a great caper movie instead of a shitty saving the world movie.  This conceptual error doomed the project from the start (in addition to all the other problems).",

    "postText": "I usually play in Zero Build (non competitive) mode with my friend and sometimes we win, but not that often. I would say most times we finish top 15. Today we invited a new friend who was playing for the first time, and we won three in a row very easily. Also, players were clearly failing to hit easy shots at us. Like, you could run in a straight line towards a player and sometimes he wouldn\u2019t hit a single shot. That, and I believe there was significantly less players wearing \u201crare\u201d skins then I usually see.\n\nDoes it mean we were playing against bots, right? Does it have anything to do with the fact that our friend js new to the game? Is there any way to avoid that? The game becomes a little bit boring like that.",

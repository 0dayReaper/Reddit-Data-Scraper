    "postText": "I never played often up until several weeks ago (I prefer Team Rumble), and first few weeks of playing Team Rumble was fun, until my matchmaking became so utterly screwed, now the only teams I face are players who are very obviously a higher skill level. The only time teams I'm on win, is when the other team just starts to leave. \n\nI am not a particularly good player, I prefer not to build (I accept the consequences of this, I only average about 10-15 kills per game), but no matter how bad/average I do in games, no matter how normal my teams are, the other team is always packed with people who will build up a 7 story fort (heh) in 3.8 seconds if you sneeze in their direction then hit you with the 360 glint of death headshot like you just made fun of their mama and it IS that serious. \n\nI just wanna shooty in the cute graphics Avatar-esque rainforest and do my quests for neat skins, stop wasting your talents in Team Rumble \ud83d\ude2d\n\n(Please do not take this seriously, just a little brain-vomit)",

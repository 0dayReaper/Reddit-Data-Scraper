A Chris Pratt Star-Lord skin would\u2019ve been so great, would\u2019ve been way better than that \u201cStar-Lord\u201d skin we have in the game. \n\nHonorable mention to Peacemaker. He was a perfect fit, he even has a spray in the game and John Cena himself is in the game.",

Important to remember that AOT has more to gain marketing wise from the collab, and so many Fortnite players (I imagine) are checking out AOT only because the ODM gear is so cool to use (as opposed to other way around which is probably less). Showing these prospective new viewers the special Titans or even simply representing the scale of the Titans could majorly spoil the show for some imo. So while I agree and wish the collab had more real content I understand why both sides did it the way they did.",

I was convinced they were getting ready for a One Piece event to correspond with the One Piece: Red movie that came out at that time, but the movie came and went and they didn\u2019t do an OP event. It made so much sense to me with the huge DBZ event they had just done to tie into their big movie. It would have been perfect, the ship would have been their ship, the pirate theme would extend cross a larger portion of the biome and a bunch of the cast would be NPC\u2019s. Putting different Devil Fruit in the game which would give you permanent abilities. I\u2019m not a big fan of One Piece but I thought it would be a really cool collaboration with one of the biggest anime\u2019s ever huge theatrical movie release.",

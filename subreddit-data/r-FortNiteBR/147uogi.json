So I never play as them unless it makes sense, like Nathan Drake, Mandalorian, etc. make sense to be using guns with no powers. \n\nBut like, I don\u2019t have a problem with them. I don\u2019t see it as an issue. The only time I do is when they put them in the battle pass because that\u2019s one less skin I\u2019ll play as in every pass. And also, collabs in the passes make them FOMO skins.",

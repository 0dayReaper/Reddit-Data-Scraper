    "postText": "Personally, I'd like to see A Plague Tale/Amicia de Rune, the main protagonist of the Plague Tale games. I think that she would have a lot to offer and there are a lot of things you can do with her. Here are my ideas for her set:\n\nFirst are her outfit and potential ideas for it. Here are the ones that appear in all of the game, when they appear, and the item you can recognize the outfit by if you look up what she looks like:\n\n* Her first outfit appears in Chapter 1 to part of Chapter 2 of Innocence. It is the least detailed of the outfits\n* Her second outfit appears in the other part of Chapter 2 to Chapter 10 of Innocence. It can be recognized by a short leather cloak with a hood\n* Her third outfit appears in Chapter 15 to the end of Innocence. It can be recognized by the short fur/hide mantle\n* Her fourth outfit appears in Chapter 1 to Chapter 8 of Requiem. It can be recognized by its blue/yellow scarf\n* Her fifth outfit appears in Chapter 9 to Chapter 16 of Requiem. It can be recognized by its green scarf and red undershirt\n* Her sixth and final outfit appears in the epilogue of Requiem. It can be recognized by its blue cape with a fur collar\n\nShe has five hairstyles: a French bun, a French braid, a shorter French braid, a French braid that goes into a small ponytail, and a pixie cut. There are a lot of items Amicia wears on her journey. There are around 18 flowers Amicia wears in her hair across the two games. She wears an orange carnation, purple aquilegia, red gladiolus, white hawthorn, yellow St. John's Wort, lavender, white daisy, purple rhododendron, yellow cinquefoils, yellow daffodil, purple nightshade, red rockfolis, purple christmas rose, white arrowhead, white chamomile, purple gentian, and pink anemone. She gets a bracer if she goes to a smuggler's den in chapter 10 of Requiem. She wears a bandage for her head injury in chapter 6 of Requiem and if you get a souvenir in the same chapter, you get a red bandage. In Innocence, there is a DLC that changes Amicia's outfit, so it can be red (the main/default color), black, yellow, and blue. So yeah, there are a lot of outfits and styles they could add\n\nNext are back blings. Now there are also a few things they could do with back blings. A few are:\n\n* The Sanguinis Itinera. In Chapter 10, Amicia gets a book called the Sanguinis Itinera, an important book made by a group of alchemists that Amicia puts on her back\n* The crossbow. In Chapter 5, Amicia gets a crossbow that has four styles: Joseph's crossbow, the Order's crossbow, the Count's crossbow, and the fourth style, which can only be unlocked through buying a DLC, the Red Damsel\n* A rat cage. The only item Amicia does not ever use but instead relates to the rats from the game. As the name suggests, there are rats sitting inside the cage\n\nThe next one is pickaxes. There is really only one option that would be really interesting and that is her sling with a stone. In Requiem, it can be used to counter and strike guards up close. Alternatively, they could do pyrite instead of a stone because in Requiem, when Amicia is nearly eaten by rats, she can strike the ground with pyrite using her sling, creating light and sparks. \n\nThere is no glider simply because there is not a lot you can do with a glider since A Plague Tale is more realistic like Resident Evil\n\nI want to do a quick bonus for lobby music: A Plague Tale: Requiem's trailer music, \"Watch Me Burn\" by Must Save Jane\n\n[Amicia de Rune from A Plague Tale: Innocence.

Several characters such as Saber and Archer could be used as skins. \n\nArtoria(Saber): \n- The design can be her overall default armored dress with different styles being her normal everyday clothes and/or her modern day bodyguard suit. \n- Backbling being either the command spells that her summoner had to signify their pact or Excalibur\u2019s sheath. \n- Harvesting tool being Excalibur with an emote to transform it from it visible and partly-invisible state. \n\nEMIYA(Archer):\n- Can use his default design from the series with the option to keep his hair more spiked up or laying more down like in the series. \n- Backbling being the command spells similar to Sabers. \n- Harvesting tool being his dual blades. \n- Has a unique effect when changing equipment.(In the series he has the ability to materialize weapons that he\u2019s seen at will) \n\nDuring the collab the crown for winning a match could be replaced with the Holy Grail and give a unique emote. \n\nAn ingame item for the collab could be the command spells from the series with three options to choose from and can only be used 1-3 times. \n\nOption 1: Give the entire team 25-50 shields instantly. \n\nOption 2: Give the entire team minor health regen(Similar to the legendary Slurp juice but only the health and no shields)\n\nOption 3: Give the entire team(Or just the individual player) a 5-10 sec damage boost.\n\nEdit: For some clarification for the series. Fate essentially boils down to a battle royal for the Holy Grail(omnipotent wish granting device) in where a mage summons an individual from the past, present or future that has done something of renown to fight along side them. Command spells are tattoo like symbols that can be used up to three time to command the summon with a command that can\u2019t be disobeyed but can also be used as a means to boost the abilities of the summon or in some cases the summoner.",

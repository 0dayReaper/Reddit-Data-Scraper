You can get a full shield back in a hurry (they take one second to consume if I remember right). I haven't really delved too much into the fishing aside from the shield fish though. I'm unsure of anymore specific details or tricks aside from watching the bobber go underwater before you reel it in. \n\nYou can grab items with a good cast of the fishing rod though! While it's a niche thing it is a tool to be mindful of.",

            "comment": "I been using all the heals to see what works better for me. The problem I was stuck on was, missing the 2-in-1 combo heal. But when I realize I don't need to be 2-in-1 since I don't need a mobility item anymore, I can carry 2 items for healing.\n\n  \nGolden Slurps obvious number 1 choice if you can get it.  \n\n\nI often now carry the full health pack, and the 50% big blue energies.   \nYeah they take awhile to heal you. However; even in a fight its like 20% of the time you can actually heal without the fight ending first.  \n\n\nWhen I find  a mist, I swap out the packs for mist spray. Only hold one, but its more versatile option. When it runs out. I go for any heal item.  \n\n\nBest fast option if I can do it is, 4 green fish, 3 blue fish. Also I can feed my animals if I really need to feed it to help me run out of the storm. It gives them stamina again.   \n\n\nSlap juice is weak, but helps you run faster too. So I would go Mist Spray and 6 slap juices.  \n\n\nOr 12 Slap Juices.  \n\n\nGun load out usually is either MK Rifle/ Drum shotgun/ Flapjack  \nOr it's Mk rile/Drum/Boomerang. If I got golden slurps, I carry the auto bot cannon if I find it or an smg/port bunker.   \n\n\nBut yeah, tons of heal combos. Just gotta practice different scenarios on how to use them. Chugs were just op. Fast/ healed both bars/ and entire team at once.",

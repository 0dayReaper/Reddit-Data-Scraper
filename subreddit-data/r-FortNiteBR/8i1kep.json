    "postText": "Thanos deserves to be more powerful than his current nerfed state in the game\n\nEpic nerfed him before the majority of the player base even got a chance to play the LTM\n\nPlayers should be running in fear from him, not pushing towards him for the easy kill while he is immobilized by his own jump\n\nHe should be OP enough to where players will work together to kill him, instead of hunting each other, because they know there is no other way to defeat him\n\nHis power stone attack should do more damage and his jump should take less time to charge, maybe even add a new defensive ability for him\n\nAs of now, it is easier to get kills in this mode as a normal player and it feels as if the potential of a boss in fortnite was missed, I really hope Epic can fix it\n\nEdit: We did it! They nerfed him again!",

The real problem is that situationally it can be impossible for thanos to kill you. Such as if the final player is in a sky base, thanos cannot hit that player (I saw a clip of this on Twitter from NoahJ) Also, if you have 2 or 3 bolt snipers or hunting rifles, and you have some distance and he tried to jump at you, you can literally chunk his health down to almost 0 (250 damage 2-3 times) with consecutive headshots during the charge up time. Then once he gets close to you with less than half health you AR him down easy. ",

Next game I pretty much had Thanos going for me relentlessly at final 6 and I was pretty much able to hold him at bay by spamming walls while he got whittled down by another guy. I ended up finishing both of them and using Thanos to lock up the last 2 kills as he is great when you can isolate your targets. \n\nTLDR: Hes pretty good, and I like the gamemode but he should be better, particularly at surviving.",

Give us 50v50 where both sides spawn in the circle and with random loadouts (this would save 7 minutes per match and give us huge fights) There's a ton of potential and directions. Heck just copy all of the big halo 3 custom games. ",

Players aren\u2019t going to go for Thanos when they can get a sure kill for the guy that is. When I have been a match I can\u2019t be bothered with Thanos because I have to worry about the 3 to 5 people I see before I get to him. \n\nWhat I would like to see is a solo queue with squads. You won\u2019t really care about your squad mates because they are randoms but they will be someone who won\u2019t kill you and may work together. If one becomes Thanos then they are no longer in the squad. Or 99 vs Thanos make everyone teammates give Thanos a shit ton of health and damage and see who comes out on top. ",

That makes no sense, EPIC. \n\nWouldn't it have been cool if you could do something specific with every stone?\n\nTime stone - use this stone and get taken back to where you were 30 seconds ago. Cooldown of 5 minutes.\n\nReality stone - use this stone and fuck with your enemy's screen (your enemy starts seeing hallucinations) Cooldown of 5 minutes.\n\nSpace stone - use this stone to teleport to anywhere on the map. Cooldown of 5 minutes.\n\nSoul stone - use this stone, and the soul of the next enemy you kill could be absorbed into the stone. At any time you want, you could release the soul, and the player you killed (only if he hasn't left the game, otherwise any one of the people you killed still spectating you can come back) comes back as a ghost and can run around in ghost form. He'll be just like a normal player, but he can't damage you nor win the game with you. One time use. (any suggestions for this would be nice, as I think it's too similar to the Mind stone.)\n\nMind stone - use this on a player and he joins your team, and can win the game with you.

He's bad at video games, doesn't play that often, but he LOVES Fortnite.\n\nSo thinking about this one, I'm considering whether it would be more fun for him to struggle becoming Thanos but when he finally gets the gauntlet he's near invincible, or get it once every 10 matches or so but die a lot sooner when he does.\n\nPart of me thinks he'd really like to just get it once, like work for it for like 30 games and finally get it, and then it's super OP. I'm sure he'd love the feeling of being that OP for 2 minutes even more than winning.\n\nBut part of me also thinks of all the roommates out there who only play once a week and would never get the chance to be Thanos, cause they don't have the time to grind for the opportunity...\n\nSo I think the first option leads to more enjoyment but ultimately, the second option (your argument) is the better choice",

I had three other guys hit me with ARs out of punching range, and that jump charge just sealed my doom. \n\nI was really looking forward to at least getting close to winning a match with lots of kills, but at this point I\u2019m better without the gauntlet.

You have a 50/50 shot at winning, while the player pool should be spread out due to looting/surviving to get into the final 50, and helps reduce the number of players just floating until they can drop right onto the Thanos powerup.\n\nTLDR: First half of the game is standard solos, Second half \"Juggernaut\" style game mode.",

Maybe a simple one would be a time stone ability where everyone near him is slowed to %50 speed and shoots at half the speed?

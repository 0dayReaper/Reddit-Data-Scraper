(They do this to keep your personal data secure) \n\nIf your account was comprimised they will tell you. \n\nYou already logged out every session and changed the password wich is good. Make sure to activate MFA (Via Email, Phone and Authenticator App) for both your EMAIL and the Epic Games Account. Every new device that tries to login must put a Code in, even if the password is correct. And they (and any potential hacker in the future) wont have the Code since you use MFA.",

If they had executed well on designs I could get over the discordant themes, but I don\u2019t find any of it compelling this season so even though the biomes are sick I think I\u2019m going to skip the pass and enjoy other games",

He looks like someone your kid would draw in class after watching Treasure Planet. He\u2019s an unironic caricature\u2014one of the most nakedly derivative characters I\u2019ve ever seen from a game that has dozens and dozens of incredibly original designs that get me more excited for Burgers and Bananas than this wanna-be explorer. He\u2019s almost offensively unoriginal.\n\nTrace is the exact same\u2014a human with vaguely fantasy, vaguely sci-fi armor that glows in the same colors and style that all of the other Fortnite skins have glowed in for the past 2 years. Rather than being an uncritical caricature of an adventurer like Lorenzo, he\u2019s derivative of three or four absolutely mid archetypes Fortnite has already given us with zero additional passion or innovation in design. \n\nPurradise Meowscles\u2014an old skin in a new shirt. If you\u2019re hype for this, you\u2019re part of the reason the battlepass tiers are progressively worse. Not because the skin is undesirable, but because you\u2019re not holding a billion-dollar developer to an entirely reasonable standard of excellence in innovative character design. \n\nOptimus Prime\u2014no creativity involved here, just a sweet, sweet check for Epic to keep a 39-year old intellectual property appealing to children and consumers in general. If you think this is innovation, let\u2019s not forget that trucks in 1984 featured the worst-polluting internal combustion engines ever built and the exciting part here is\u2026 they can turn into hulking melee robots or planes. We\u2019re not even talking sleek Teslas or Rivians here. I love me a throwback but when you get Conan the Barbarian next season, your hype for Optimus Prime is why.\n\nAt least they could have given us Jurassic Park\u2014an older franchise being actively reimagined, updated, made marginally more sophisticated, and\u2026 appropriate to the biomes in this season. Fortnite asks us to suspend a lot of reality to avoid feeling like it\u2019s a fan service medley like Kingdom Hearts or PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, but when your new experiences are mud mechanics in the swamp or punching a velociraptor as Optimus Prime\u2026 I mean these things are neat in theory but you\u2019ve really given up on any cohesive plot as a throughline, and that is a far cry from past seasons where the whole map was under threat and the skins were characters from the defenders or the aggressors, or when the theme was filmmaking and Hollywood, or restaurants and food, or summer pool and beach parties, or winter and Christmas, or autumn and Halloween. In each of these you felt like you were a part of some kind of movement\u2014some articulable moment in time. This season feels like going through the junk drawer while reruns play in the background.",

When I saw the new trees in the trailer I thought we'd get Avatar skins because those trees scream Pandora and all these plants and the grind vines are so perfect for it despite it being kind of late to the newest movie release. If they added the Ikran it would be so cool to have a flying mount you could shoot off of like the dirt bikes. But yet another meh ninja girl... long haired meowscles is cute but he's the bonus skin? He could have replaced the red haired guitar girl easily. If I didn't have the pass already from crew I wouldn't have bought this pass",

However, I also like Relik with his entire suit fully on, particularly the Deepwalker version. I love those types of skins. But overall, the battle pass is decent, because I expected a better Tier 100 skin than Optimus Prime, although it's still very cool in my opinion. In addition, all the skins aren't as cool and sometimes doesn't get me enthusiastic or exhilarated like before. Just anticipating for a bit advanced battle pass next season and perhaps another biome.",

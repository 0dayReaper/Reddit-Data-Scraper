There's nothing like having a perfectly fine game until you unfortunately jump/fall off from height and bam. Death. This guy's way too prevalent in my games, I swear they gotta do something about the matchmaking because 9/10 I'm dying to him. He causes me to lose my composure and make me fall off a high place and domes me for all my health. Do you think that fall damage has gotten too good this season?",

But its only a one time use per day though, once you've gotten your 360k xp you can't afk for another 2 hours and get another (trust me I tried) but the xp resets anyway when the itemshop resets so no worries. \n\nAlso no fill squad bot lobbies is great, If you atleast kill 6 - 8 squads and just go to a massive manhunt you can get 30k xp per game plus you get to progress your milestones REALLY fast. But I rarely do this now since uefn maps usually gives me the levels I need (plus STW)",

Use an autoclicker so you don't get DC and leave it for atleast 2 hours, You can get extra xp if you afk a little more like 30mins more but its up to you. Just remember that you won't get that much BIG bonus if you afk for 1 hr more. I did this and compared to 2 hrs and 4 hrs of afk it was still the same so don't waste your time",

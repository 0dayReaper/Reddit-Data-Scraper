After we looted him and his team mate he crawled back into my trap in his own. It was a good 30 seconds or more but seemed like minutes.\n\nTo whoever that carbide was, if you see this, THANK YOU SO MUCH!! I tried to get his name from the kill feed and message him but it was too long and complex to remember. And I have replays disabled.",

While there is definitely overlap between programming and QA and asset creation, they are by and large separate teams with different qualifications and resources. \n\nNew cosmetics and items follow a fairly rigid schedule, whereas new bugs come up organically and without warning as content is added on a schedule. These QA teams are often much smaller than the asset creation and programming teams, and unless a bug is totally game breaking, it likely will take more time to be reported, repeated in a testing environment, investigated, and fixed. \n\nTL;DR: Making games is complicated.",

That and the occasional clutch play or two (which are pretty cool sometimes I won't lie.)\n\nI just don't get the hype for this game. If a 1 vs. 100 type of play style has so many issues then what's going on? I saw a post a few days ago of a guy ranting about it and it made perfect sense to me. How can you play this game 6-8 hours a day? While it may be a cool game, which games are supposed to be, why do you continue sinking hours into it?\n\n I'm not bashing the players by any means. I just don't understand the constant drive and loyalty to a game that's going to screw you over 2 hours in when you finally have a chance to win.\n ",

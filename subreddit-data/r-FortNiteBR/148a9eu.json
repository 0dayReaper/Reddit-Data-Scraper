They use numbers to make certain effects happen.\n\nSo for the blue material as an example, contains a bunch of different information. This includes a Texture, which is the 2D pattern/art. The artists would come in and set in-built values for things like Roughness and Metallic, which affects how light should interact with the blue material (eg, should it look shiny or matte?).\n\nA tech artist can then come in and add some fancier rules, that change some of the values in real time instead of a baked in value. For example, the blue material is using normal (gradient) shading, but they add an extra rule that ANY shadow that's darker than say 30%, shows as 100% shadow. This gives the shadow the cel shading look without affecting anything that's well-lit. Technical art is also how they do things like animations on gun wraps, have the characters get splashed with mud, or have characters look all starry on the inside. It's definitely detail oriented and its impressive the amount of thought that went into this skin!\n\nIf you're curious to read more, you can read up on material graphs in UE, or look up some of the Epic Games technical art tutorials and presentations by the evangelism team!",

Well dota 2 really doesnt give a shit about the casuals. Everything except qol and bugs is catered towards keeping the pro scene balanced. Theres been maybe a few times where a hero wasnt OP in the proscene but was just roflstomping pubs and it got patched. Because honestly there is no outright casuals. Even the ones who play casually care a LOT about the game. You dont play dota to have fun you play dota to win. ",

They never realize how bad they are in order to be matched with a new player. \n\nIt really is a shame how toxic dota players can be, because if you play dota long enough, or watch pro players stream long enough, you get an epiphany like \"I WAS WRONG, *THIS* IS DOTA.\" And then 3 months later you see RTZ do something weird like build battlefury on every character and you get another epiphany that blows your mind, and then you get another and then another. And this keeps happening until just when you think you are the all knowing Zen master of dota 2, you meet some Peruvian with an anime/hentai profile picture who is named \"smash es mi pastor\" who completely destroys and outplays you with jungle lina or some shit and you're back at square 1.",

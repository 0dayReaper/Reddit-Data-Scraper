The silver grease under your cpu, needs to be cleaned and re-newed. It becomes old, hard, crusty. sucks at transfering heat. Slows your entire laptop down. Pain in the ass to actually access in a laptop.   \n\n\n3. There could be dust in your laptop, which agian would be insane pain to open up and clean. Opening laptop is hard enough, but putting it together again forget it.   \nDust can also heat up your laptop and slow you down.",

To resolve this, you'll need to change to DirectX 12 mode and crank up the graphics quality to medium-high. I recommend setting View Distance, Textures and Post Processing to Epic, enable ambient occlusion and don't use Nanite. Tune the rest of the settings to your liking while making sure your GPU is hitting over 95% utilization at all times to avoid stutters and performance drops. Also, remember to set an FPS limit.",

Nvidia, which makes the GPU of your laptop, has a piece of software called GeForce Experience. Download it and install the latest Game Ready or Studio drivers available. Nvidia releases Game Ready drivers every month and Studio drivers every 2 months so it's a good idea to have the latest version installed at all times.",

It could also be the way your Windows installation is configured or programs that may be interfering with Fortnite's processes. At this point, I recommend a full reinstallation of Windows or cloud gaming if it's viable.",

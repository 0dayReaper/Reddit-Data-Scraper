Since a stream sniper knows that they have thousands of people watching, they want to gloat over the fact they killed the streamer \n\nHowever in this instance it just looks like a guy who is emoting because he has a lot of spectators. Especially because the spectators didn\u2019t insta-quit\n\n*Edit: Spelling",

If I remember correctly, a steamer lost an online tournament (possibly) as a result of someone ghosting their stream to know the streamer's hand. Most of us believe that practice is scummy, but we also acknowledge that this is the risk you take when you stream. \n\nI believe stream sniping in games like Fortnite and PUBG is unfortunate but not something we should be should policing because that is the risk you take with literally broadcasting your location to the world.",

This is why i like for example Just9n or Chocotaco as a streamer, because they give a lot of credit to the person that kills him and not blaming others for their own mistakes.",

All this is doing is just ruining the game for others, cause those people have been dedicated to practicing and have spent money on a free game!

We console players need it because we cannot be as precise as mouse players can be. Its in every console game because its needed but nah ninja is apparently a know it all. According to him streamers shouldn't be allowed to play a game like creative destruction because its a rip off, of fortnite. Well i dont see fortnite sueing it now do i? Hes like every streamer who plays it is slapping epic in the face. They arent affiliated with epic and are free to do whatever they want especially if theyre getting money out of it. Ninja is just a cry baby. I don't understand how he climbed to the top. His ego is extremely big, Ever noticed why he doesn't play in competitions? Its cause he knows he will lose. Ninja isnt as good as other players and thats also why he doesnt 1v1 anyone. He wants to keep the illusion going that hes the best in order to rake in viewers. Once theres proof he isnt the 8-9yos will go away",

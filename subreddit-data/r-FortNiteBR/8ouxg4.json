I saw how that game runs on my friend\u2019s Xbox, and I was floored at how much worse the experience was - and instead of polishing it they were going ham making the game work on mobiles!!!    \n   \nThis lawsuit was the cherry on top.

The first test servers everything ran great, decent fps(decent for xbox Pubg), everything rendered quickly too. They had 3 different updates for the test server and each update made it even worse. The last update brought in so many bugs it wasn't even funny and the fps was even worse. Finally switched to fortnite about a week ago and man am I having fun. There so many ways to kill people and I love the building aspect. I'm not the greatest at building but its decent compared to a lot of people I have played against who have played longer than I have. That and the solid 60fps. I love this game.",

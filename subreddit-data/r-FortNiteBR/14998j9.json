Most people only care about the PS+ Packs that include skins though, which are every third season on average. \n\nThe seasons in-between include things like emotes, emojis, gliders, pickaxes, wraps and so on, usually matching either the previously released PS+ skin or the next one coming up.\n\nWe also already know what the next PS+ skin is, it's &gt;!a recolor of Cryptic!&lt;.",

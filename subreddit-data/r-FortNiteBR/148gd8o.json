Most of them loved dmr and sniper. Even after practicing with those two for a long time I could never reproduce the accuracy on KBM they got on controller. They could fry people with a DMR but couldn't hit a thing with a red eye. It left me wondering if on non hit scan the aim assist was just code that if they were within a certain envelope of being on target that it would register the hit. The smaller the envelope the higher % of time it would register the hit. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

It's not, you gotta learn to get good with it, it might take you a week but its worth it, often the best weapons are harder to use, like the red eye or the pump.\n\nI guarantee if you put in the time to learn the red eye, you would have fried with it\n\nI didn't like it when I first used it either, but knowing its hit scan and seeing people fry with it, I knew I just had to put in the time to learn it",

It doesn\u2019t matter how far, how fast they\u2019re moving, nothing. You just put the dot on them at any range and you hit shots. If you can\u2019t do that, and if that doesn\u2019t make the red eye a more consistent and better gun than the dmr at range, that\u2019s a skill issue on your part. \n\nYou don\u2019t see pros using the DMR, you don\u2019t see streamers using it, you don\u2019t see it in tournaments or comp, why?? Because it\u2019s not as good as the red eye. It\u2019s literally that simple. You can try to spin it any way you want \n\nThe best aimer in the world would struggle to hit as many shots on moving targets with the dmr as the red eye. I\u2019m speaking facts.\n\nYour comment is ironic considering the best aimers would and do choose the red eye, if you have amazing aim the red eye rewards that. \n\nNo one in comp, or playing at a high level in intense games wants to take bullet travel and drop into account when a weapon exists that you don't have to. No nonsense just point and shoot. You don't see people getting beamed out of the sky with DMRs ever by any streamer, in any tournament by any pros. \n\nThe dmr fries no doubt, but it fries on targets that aren\u2019t moving, which is uncommon, and it\u2019s bad at longer ranges, where the red eye fries. At the range the DMR excels at, even the havoc AR would out-DPS it. \n\nIt\u2019s also a skill issue if you don\u2019t understand how huge of an advantage hitscan is over projectile and how to use that to your advantage. \n\nI\u2019m sick of the logic a lot of these DMR players use honestly.And im not a DMR hater, Ch3S4 I ran the chrome shotty / cobra for the whole season.\n\nDownvote me all you want homies. Go watch any streamer on YouTube, Tfue, Zemie, Replays, Ninja, anyone, no one will be using the DMR\n\nGo play a tournament, no one will be using a DMR. Its for good reason",

Entirely because, as you\u2019ve stated yourself, even the best players struggle to do it? It is still possible for everyone to struggle in that area and it be a skill issue.\n\nI wasn\u2019t stating about how often even the best players would pick up the weapon *at all*, only about how it would be much more difficult to use the DMR, therefore needing much more skill to consistently hit shots. Just for that struggle, it isn\u2019t better in reality, but it still is entirely better just by its stats.\n\nTop players will often use any weapon that works consistently enough for them, not necessarily what requires the most skill. Especially with the way Epic tends to balance stuff, there\u2019s rarely ever a perfect correlation there.",

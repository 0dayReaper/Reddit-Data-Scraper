    "postText": "When I first saw it, I thought it was gon be like a revamped Neo Tilted (chapter 1 season 9 anyone?). But nah, barely anyone lands there, it doesn't feel as colourful and lively as Neo Tilted, you can't break down the buildings, it just feels unwelcoming after that.   \n\n\nSure the grinding rail system is cool but that's all I can say. As for comparing it to Neo Tilted? Reason I'm doing so is cause it just feels wrong that the same team that could make one of the coolest futuristic POIs ever with the wind turbine, the holograms, the futuristic clock tower couldn't do a better job with Mega City.",

If you land there right off the bat, very few people will usually join you, despite the massive amount of loot there. There\u2019s plenty of mobility in the area too, so moving around is easy.\n\nLate game? Mega is such a big, twisty and vertical location that you can hide from people in a virtually indestructible room and they\u2019ll never find you. I\u2019ve won multiple fights by giving people the run-around with doors, ascenders and grind rails and just shooting them while they\u2019re bamboozled.\n\nAs for the design of Mega City vs Neo Tilted\u2026I consider them about the same. Neo Tilted had more futuristic things, like the blimps, and holograms. But Mega City fits the \u201cNeo\u201d theme a bit more due to how densely packed and massive it is.",

A heist every-time. \n\nRegarding the city itself, there is loot everywhere, an upgrade station, and plenty of gold. Plus multiple mobility options on the ground for rotations (trampoline at docks, jumping from rails, cars, bikes). And then rails and vents for fast movement. \n\n\u2014-\n\nRegarding the vibe, it\u2019s spooki. I love it. It feels like a city that was transported without its people a few seconds before a disaster. And lore wise, it essentially was; the city and waring factions were transported to save them from a war. It\u2019s well executed per the lore.\n\n**I truly believe a lot of the hate is motivated by subconscious reactions of terror to the prospect of an empty city. It\u2019s disturbing**\n\nIt\u2019s just being coded as complaints about the map.

            "comment": "They need to add more incentives to go there. Personally, I love it! But it can be totally boring when it\u2019s always like an abandoned city. Would be way more fun if there was a proper boss there (not that week ass group of cards). But really that\u2019s true for the whole game. We need better bosses that drop more rare loot. By more rare I mean, it\u2019s too easy to get rare loot all over. There should be less of it and y should have to fight for it more. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what other incentives could be, but for sure as it is\u2026 there\u2019s not enough reasons to go there. Would be a great zone wars map though. Do they have that in creative. If it was busy and bumping with people it could be super fun!",

Mega City has a dope theme, tons of buildings to loot, actually feels like a big city, and now with the jungle stuff, less people land there so it is even easier to stack up on a ton of loot having super low risk. I honestly think mega city is underrated, but it's nice that way so I don't mind.",

Those locations had few floors but cool interiors. \n\nIf anything is underrated, I would say Neo Tilted is. So many people hate on it for no apparent reason but I haven't seen a SINGLE person on here come out and say that Mega City is bad which is why I felt the need to.",

I\u2019ve never had to log in prior since when you tie your account, be it console or pc, to the game, it STAYS signed in. It shouldn\u2019t just log you out. I\u2019d be concerned as hell too if I log in without doing anything different and am greeted with a page I haven\u2019t seen since C1, and the excuse for it even occurring C1 was cause it was being developed early on. This is YEARS later, with plenty of time to develop an auto login system and perfect it. \n\nI\u2019m more worried on why you\u2019d think a concern shouldn\u2019t be addressed and asked on by others who know the game. If they just assumed and put their login in, all their crap could be stolen. \n\nBest to actually ask for help beforehand than actually getting screwed by some rando who hacked his account, logged him out, and keylogs his password and account name to take potentially years worth of purchases to sell off to some higher bidder, or to even just log them out entirely and change the password and username just to screw with them",

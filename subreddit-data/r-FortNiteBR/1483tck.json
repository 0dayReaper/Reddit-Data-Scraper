All in all, easy 110 nukes if you can avoid getting punished while firing.\n\nAlso don't diss firefly jars. Those can make quite a killing if you do direct hits on the enemy and also punishes enemies for exhausting their stamina to approach you. Wasp jars are way worse and are what you should be disregarding as they have no direct hit damage and the wasps are very easy to avoid so long as the victim doesn't shoot the wasp swarm (which makes me wonder why they made an augment for wasp jars when firefly jars are just superior and would actually make the augment in question viable if they were swapped around).",

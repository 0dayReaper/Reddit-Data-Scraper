    "postText": "I don't know what happened here but I decided to give this game a try I selected the epic preset at 4k which gave me only \\~50fps and very stuttery game play. This is surprising because I always select the ultra preset on other games and get good returns (capped at 165fps in overwatch, 80 fps on rdr2, and 60 fps in elden ring with rtx on). Whats the issue here?   \n\n\nMy specs are:  \ni9-10900kf  \nRTX 3080ti (Gigabyte gaming OC)  \n32GB ddr4 3400mhz   \nThank you",

Casual players were annoyed they had to play \"sweaty\" (serious/competitively), and high skill players were annoyed they couldn't play casually since they were stuck will all of the high skill players. And since match making was skill based, lag increased and annoyed everyone. And this was all done behind closes doors without communication.\n\nNot sure if its around in Destiny 2 b/c I didn't buy it, but it probably is.\n\nEdit: Grammer",

I'm not good by any stretch, but I'm not the worst player in the world either. Playing Fortnite makes me feel like I've got fucking Parkinsons disease half the time. It's embarrassing to sneak up on someone, shotgun them in the back, and then die because they start jumping around and popping you with a pistol. \n\nFuck you Nvidia. I don't want you to save that death clip. Delete that shit forever please. ",

It's a big thing for streamers to build someone into a box and place the trap down to kill them while they are trapped in the box. It's hard because the trap has a small delay after it's placed so you have to time it very well and keep them in the box.\n\nIt's famous to do because the entire rest of the game you have freedom of movement / can shoot through walls to get through. So the \"victim\" usually dies to the trap because they freak out/freeze up/don't do anything to prevent it. \n\nKind of like using a knife as an assassin instead of sniping someone from 1000 ft away.

My buddies served as excellent meat shields buying me time to get 3 kills but I wasn\u2019t fast enough to save them.  I was left alone with 3 other players.\n  \nTime was short after the battle and the circle was closing so I had to cover some ground and head towards the forest between Snobby Shores and Haunted Hills (B4).  Kept looking around to see where they were but saw nothing.  I figure I'd get in the circle and setup a base trying to do my best.  \n\nRight as I get there and I found a nice spot to build my log cabin I turned and saw building behind about 100 yards away on the hill from where I had just come.  I panicked and started firing the AR then lobbing grenades with the launcher to see if I could pick one or two off before spamming some walls.  Player in the clip charges me so i swap to the shotgun in an attempt to take him out close range.  I hit one shot then realize what is going on so I start going for the walls to escape before the death trap but with them spamming walls it was inevitable.  \n\nLooking back i should have made stairs and ran out the top or crouched in the corner to buy some time.  But, I am a bad player.  Rest is reddit history.\n",

They knew it was just me left hiding in one of the buildings still in the circle.\n\nI will also admit that I've also died do mass pickaxe from a squad of 4. They were trying to build around me and kill me with pickaxes in the recent sniper mode. I escaped a few of these prisons. However, the 4 of them ended up chasing me down as I tried to do 180-degree jumps to shoot once with a crappy grey revolver. I never knocked any down even though I landed a few hits. Wasn't hitting the same guy I guess. They ended up getting me. My friends were laughing at me a lot... I was laughing too. It was retarded and awesome at the same time. I'm sure I made that squad's night and was happy to oblige.",

Playing squad, I was downed by a couple of guys with the skeleton skin (for added creepiness) and instead of finishing me off they just build walls around me and kept me as a pet, jumping and dancing around me. When my tm8 finally came to rescue me they Rekt him with pumps and I disconnected before I  could watch him suffer the same fate. ",

So I ran up to his structure and built stairs all around the outside, keeping pace with him until he stopped.  I ended up behind him as he posted up with his yellow crossbow looking for targets.  He had no idea I was even there...\n\nSo, I sat there w/ my tactical shotty aimed at his head for a good couple of seconds when he realized, \"Hey, all these stairs aren't mine\" and turns around to see me.  I panicked, shot once and did like 6 damage, jumped into his tower and he wasted me with a pistol.  I wasn't even mad.",

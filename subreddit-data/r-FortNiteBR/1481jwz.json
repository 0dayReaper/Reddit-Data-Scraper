    "postText": "I'm not sure how to explain, but it feels like there's no weight to the gun. For example, the Cobra has a satisfying sound I guess whenever you shot the gun, and it felt like there was like a weight to it. The Thermal DMR has practically no recoil (I think) and it doesn't make a sound at all when you shoot it. It makes me feel like I'm missing more shots than I should be because of that",

I'll sneak up on people sitting still, have my crosshair dead on them and the shots miss. 9/10 of my shots miss no matter the distance and no matter the speed I am clicking at. I don't know what it is but shots that look like they should be landing just don't for me. I'll stick with the red eye.",

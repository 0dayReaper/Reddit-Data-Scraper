When using an SMG or other close-range weapons, aiming for the body rather than the head can be more effective due to the higher chance of hitting the target. In this case, crouching may not provide as much benefit since it slows down your movement speed and can make you an easier target for opponents aiming at your body.",

            "comment": "1. Health. You knew people were around you, but you didn't bother to bring yourself up to 250hp. *Always* assume your opponent is at 100% strength, and work to match them. You would have *barely* won the fight if you were 250.\n\n2. Movement &amp; Cover. You had an upperhand over Era right out the gate, being behind a doorframe and being able to peek out to the right of it. You should have stayed inside to force her through the chokepoint instead of moving to meet her, and on top of that you could have moved more to mitigate the damage you took by strafing left and right and/or crouching.\n\n3. Weapons. Typically, snipers are long-range, ARs are long-to-mid, SMGs are mid-to-close, and shotguns are close-range. You were standing right on front of Era, but instead of swapping to your drum shotgun, you kept the SMG out, and it let her win the battle of attrition (which was made worse by not being at 250 as I mentioned before).\n\n4. Aim. Even despite the range and health difference, you could have won if you weren't attempting to ADS. At such a close range it's pretty safe to spray with the SMG, yet you ADSed, and it not only slowed your walking speed to make you easier to hit, but it ironically also made you *miss* your shots as they went right past her head while she still hit you.",

To make up for the lack of endurance in Zero Builds (since throwing up a wall was basically a shield), they implemented a 50hp overshield that recharges on its own after not taking damage for long, thus 250hp total.",

It\u2019s a little different with guns with very high damage like the mythic shotgun because that can 1 shot in the head.

The biggest mistakes you clearly made were two things:\n\n1.  Positioning - You lost several bullets of your spray into the wall you strafed in front of. \n2.  Once you saw the door open the first time you knew exactly where he was, you did not aim there nor prefire right before the door opened like your opponent.  You dropped ADS and ran to open the door again which allowed him to get first shot on you.  Your opponent held ADS as soon as he saw you and waited for you to come barreling in.\n3.  Accuracy- If you had pulled up and hit one additional to the head you would have killed him.\n4. You couldve used the door to swap to a shotgun and peek shot him.\n\nAnother note on the accuracy front, you first ADS at the door you knew the player was at was foot level, you adjusted to center body before the engagement began, there was no visible attempt at adjusting for the other players head.  \n\nThis feels somewhat because of the AA doing most of your work.  Not bashing on Aim Assist, just informing.  Its something very common I\u2019ve noticed when watching two controller players in CQC.  Neither has any control of their shots so they rush each other in this weird, \u201cGimme a kiss\u201d way until the head is the only thing natural for the rotational aim assist to hit. \ud83d\ude18",

Generally you want to lead with a shotgun shot as it deals massive damage, then switch to your SMG or Assault Rifle to get a quick series of shots in",

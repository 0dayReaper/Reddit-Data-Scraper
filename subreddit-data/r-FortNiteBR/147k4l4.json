My aim isn't the issue. I just have no idea what i'm actually shooting, does anyone have a list of what is a projectile weapon and what is hitscan? I'm struggling the most with the scoped AR and DMR, but I'm fine with the unscoped suppressed rifle.",

Regular Assault Rifles, Smgs and other weapons tend to be Hitscan.",

If you can get past those 'issues' the red-eye is more accurate, hands down.\n\nOf course, the Red-eye also suffers from higher damage-falloff than DMR or any Sniper, so that one of the issues you might be facing when you use it for sniping.",

In theory, while very hard to do, you could technically block an incoming bullet after it has been fired by building a wall between you and the bullet.\n\nHitscan weapons do not have any kind of bullet physics. They look where you are pointing your weapon, add bloom if applicable (some weapons have first-shot accuracy, so no bloom), and that's where your bullet is going to land. No travel time, no physics affecting the bullet. Once you shoot it, it hits where the calculation wants it to hit, immediately.\n\nAfter the shot, recoil is applied to each weapon, regardless of Projectile or hitscan based. Bloom is applied when shooting it, unless the weapon has first-shot accuracy.",

It won't be as much of an advantage for them since they most likely don't get great frames and players who play on potatoes aren't typically your ttv sweats. \n\nThe problem I see with this is that the ttv sweats with powerful rigs will start using performance mode which will force the rest of the sweats to do it as well to keep up. Basically rendering all of the graphics obsolete and pointless unless you don't care about winning at all. And let's be honest, this is a competitive mp game. We all want to win.",

    "postText": "Hey, I have a YouTube channel which I will not give the name of as I don\u2019t want to get this removed for self promo \ud83e\udd23 but I need help with recording content. I plan on doing a series similar to YouTuber MarrenTM\u2019s road to pro as well as many other videos focused on Fortnite. I have a huge passion for video making and grinding the competitive scene but I just wish I could document it online. My channel already has an alright platform of about 1500 subscribers but there\u2019s no way to record Fortnite videos. I play on Xbox Series S with 120fps so I assumed I would need a capture card. I bought one for my birthday but it is a 60fps one, so I set it up and found out that unless my gameplay is 60fps it will not capture, but I can\u2019t stand playing 60fps and want 120. I have a pc which I could capture content on easier, but my pc only runs Fortnite at 60fps too so I need a way around this. Do I need to buy a 120fps capture card or is there an easier way? Someone please help I would appreciate it a lot :)",

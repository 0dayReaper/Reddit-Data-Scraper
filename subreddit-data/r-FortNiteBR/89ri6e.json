Four other people also had the same idea as me and we all landed at the top of it at about the same time. I was banking on grabbing a gun the fastest, but I only grabbed an impulse grenade. So, I threw it with the goal of knocking everyone out but myself. But as you can assume, I knocked everyone out including myself and we all died.",

You jump off a ramp while shooting, your body travels slightly faster than the rocket, and you are instantly on the rocket without having to destroy a floor or anything. Or you can just stand on an open door(with half your body hanging off the door, fly the rocket and pick yourself up off of the door. That version takes almost as long as OPs, so its not nearly as effective as the instant ride, but it is *much* easier to get. \n\n[Here](https://clips.twitch.tv/JoyousAltruisticAppleStinkyCheese) is the door version.\n\nIf anyone has a link to the instant ride, feel free to link that as well.",

Thats already without rocket riding, with its inteded purpose. I don't want this game to become about who the most lucky is while looting. I don't read comments in this sub nearly enough, i mostly come for funny gifs and clips. So I don't know how far off I am from common opinion, with that said; Am I wrong for thinking this thing has to go? Convince me otherwise. \n\nMy suggestion: Change its steering power. Make it go really sluggish, not allowing it to make these sharp turns. ",

If you make sure to either shoot the rocket down right away, which only takes 4 shots or so, or just keep building a wall right before it hits, it makes defending against it much easier. \n\nAlso, when I see one of these rockets go off, I'm instantly inclined to try and bunker the team with it, as they have a player basically afk, and we can likely out number them or catch them off guard.\n\nWith that being said, I don't disagree with the nerf you suggested. Making the steering a bit more stiff, or even adding different type of ammo like someone else suggested both seem like good ideas as well. ",

Its like a powerful artillery addition to the footsoldiers hitting you. Breaks any defence if executed well. To be honest I don't like the idea of a new Ammo type for it. These are after all rockets and adding ammo for a single gun alone only makes the game more convoluted or bloated or whatever, in my opinion. ",

And it's incredibly slow and loud so its not like it will sneak up on you like bullets. The most OP thing about it is it's scouting potential, but it balances out since the player is giving away his general location and is taken out of the game. Rocket riding isn't OP in squads since it results in sending one of your players to your opponents base, usually a 1v4 situation. And in duos you're stranded by yourself while your teammate is lightyears ahead of you fighting a 1v2.",

He 1v2'd 3 other teams but this one had homing missile. \n\nThese guys played it pretty bad honestly. The other one could have just continued spamming rockets to completely CC my friend but there was about a minuet in between where, I guess he got bored, and decided to rush to try kill my friend. They couldnt so he went back to rockets then stopped once again, probably bored because its a lame weapon. It would have been way worse if they just continued the missile and AR spam. \n\nHonestly this weapon is very anti-fun and it makes me sad every time I have to face one. The only bright side is you dont see them often.  \n\n[clip from my stream yesterday for all that want to see it](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/246451799?t=01h52m22s)\n\nAny tips on what my friend could have done better to win that?",

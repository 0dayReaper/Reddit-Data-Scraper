    "postText": "I saw many times that users on this sub use this term to describe a type of weapon usually. Sorry If I am asking a stupid question but just want to fully understand if this is a good thing or a bad thing.  \n\n\nAnd yesterday I saw a video on the youtube where Evolve Jake says that drum shotgun and flapjack rifle is busted. He is saying this I think as he means that those weapons are busted, but in a good way but on the other side I see users complaining about the same weapons as they get killed too easily with those.  \n\n\nSo am little confused here...why complain and why don't you just use those weapons yourself? Or maybe those weapons are broken so they don't work the same way always? So manye questions here...thanks for helping out guys :)",

            "comment": "I\u2019m pretty sure that it means that it is over-powered, or OP, in comparison to the rest of the loot pool.   \n\nObviously, if you have it, you could say it\u2019s a good thing, and if you are up against its then a bad thing.\n\nHowever, I think it has the negative connotation since it\u2019s better to have a balanced loot pool, generally speaking.\n\nI watch Evolve Jake but I haven\u2019t seen the video you are probably refer to.   If he was being positive, he probably means \u201ctake of advantage of it\u201d , \u201cbuild a strategy to get it\u201d yet he probably would not want any OP loot in the game as a whole.\n\nIt will probably be nerfed at some stage as most, but not all, busted weapons seem to be eventually.\n\nEdit: syntax",

And I\u2019m top 10 in almost 1 in 3 games, including a fair few 2nd places which is probably my most common finish.  Overall, I\u2019m very happy with this.  \n\nThe only time I could imagine that I could begin to get frustrated with something that was OP would be if I began losing to that weapon all the time and my win rate dropped to 1% or 2% (1 win in every 50 or 100 games doesn\u2019t sound as much fun) and more so if I consistently failed to get top 10.   \n\nBut the game seems to be rigged to keep me happy with or without the OP items!\n\nEdit: syntax as always",

There are various badges like this one that you can equip by subscribing to the monthly subscription for this sub with bricks you\u2019ve received from this sub.\n\n[Edit] Forgot to mention that different badges gives your username different colours. For example: this specific shade of blue that mine has is exclusive to the \u201cWerewolf paw\u201d badge (I could be wrong on that one, tho. I don\u2019t want to try out every badge just to find one that matches)",

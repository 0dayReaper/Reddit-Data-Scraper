    "postText": "I downloaded fortnite for the first time and i am facing a severe problem . whenever i try to play any kind of battle royale mode my fortnite freezes on connecting screen and after 5-10 mins it crashes. when its frozen im not able to do anything like close , alt-f4 or even open task manager , i just have to wait for it to crash . 1 time i managed to open the task manager while it was still frozen and saw that fortnite was taking up 4.2gb ram out of my 8gb ram which i dont think is normal . i know many other players who are able to play without any problem on same or worse pc specs . i really need to fix this and i have tried everything on youtube and google . plzz help!!\n\nMy Pc specs:-\n\ncore i5 10400f\n\n1x8gb ddr4 ram\n\nintel uhd 630 graphics ",

Download a free program called CCleaner - run it and clean up your pc. Check what startup and background apps are running and turn off everything unnecessary. Make sure the game is running on directx11 and not 12.",

Make sure your firewall is allowing through battleye, easy anticheat, epic and fortnite (whichever are on the list). Uninstall the game and epic launcher and do a fresh install. Last resort and really depends how bad you wanna play, back up your important files and reinstall windows",

Here's some points to get there that this would help with.\n\n- No random team members dying early.\n\n- Even team fights, excluding disconnects and/or douchebags.\n\n- More predictability with the circle so you can setup earlier.\n\nCurrently it's a crapshoot in 20v20v20v20v20 if you're going to even have ONE team setup in a base. It's fairly rare and usually involves a team and other stragglers pushing Retail Row while the other team has leveled it and set-up due to a graceful circle.\n\nMore structure in the beginning of a match will result in a much better mid thru end game.",

If they do that, I think we\u2019ll see some great big bases.\n\nEdit: it actually might be useful to have an area that is off limits for most of the match, then have the zone close in toward that off limits area, then toward the end of the match, allow entrance into the off limits area. For example, have a mini storm over tilted towers, have the regular storm push everyone toward tilted towers, then after the second or third storm, remove the mini storm from over tilted towers. By that point, both teams will have huge bases on both sides of Tilted Towers and people can risk rushing into titled for additional loot.",

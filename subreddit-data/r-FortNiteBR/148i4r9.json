    "postText": "Imagine a base skin you can get that you can completely customize. I\u2019d imagine you could chose between 3-5 hair styles, tops, bottoms, and shoes and they would have a wide variety of skin colours. \n \nFor backblings we could have a plumbob. Maybe it could even be reactive based on your health (goes red when your health is low). \n\nFor emotes there are tons of options. One that comes to mind could be taking a bite of fruitcake and either loving it or hating it (like you do in the game during your welcome wagon). Another would be a classic sim waving while saying Sul Sul. \n\nThe reason this came to mind is because of the use of Llamas in the sims (it\u2019s their mascot essentially) and in Fortnite. \n\nI think it would be so fun and bring a whole other side of gaming to Fortnite!",

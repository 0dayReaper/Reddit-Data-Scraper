    "postText": "( I only play zero build) I see a lot of people shiting on mobility, which is fine, you are free to your opinion, but I feel the game was much more fun with all the mobility items in it. Aside from the obvious benefits of not having to walk for the entire game, easier looting and the making you feel like a badass element etc, from a gameplay perspective, when you engage someone it\u2019s always good to have more options than shoot. In the new season I feel like if there are 4-6 people remaining the one who has high ground is most likely gonna win, You can\u2019t really negate their advantage, where as with mobility you had a chance, albeit with some risk. I think mobility added an extra dimension to the game that isn\u2019t present in this season. Now the obvious counter is just be better at positioning, which is true but I think having an advantageous position shouldn\u2019t be such a strong advantage, it was still advantageous in the last season but now it\u2019s too much. Besides the endgame gameplay was way more fun last season, it was possible to clutch a 1v2 or a 1v3 in squads due to mobility giving you chances to pick your opponents one by one, but now if they come at you all at once you\u2019re just fucked. That\u2019s my 2 cents on the matter. And before someone says aLl wE hAd bAcK iN tHe dAy WeRe sHoPpiNg cArtS aNd iT wAs aWsOme, I\u2019ve been playing on and off since 2017, and the last season was the most fun I\u2019ve had with this game by a long shot",

            "comment": "I think some mobility is okay. Things like shockwave grenades, launch pads, and maybe even rifts that are in fixed locations. Cars and other vehicles are fine too. I cannot stand these items like the hammer, sword, ODM/web shooters, etc that let people cover hundreds of meters of distance quickly and practically indefinitely.\n\nIf you find yourself outnumbered or without cover, that sounds like poor planning on your part. I\u2019m not sure why you should be able to get out of that situation? If you got outplayed due to your own poor game sense why do you deserve an item to bail you out? This game isn\u2019t just about gun play- it should be about strategy too.",

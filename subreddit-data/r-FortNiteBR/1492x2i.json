            "comment": "Every weapon comes with a fire-rate. In case of automatic weapons, this fire-rate is the actual amount of shots fired per second, while on semi-automatic weapons it's the highest amount you can achieve by spam-clicking your weapon. For example, the Cobra DMR had a fire rate of 4 shots per second max, the Red-eye is slightly slower at 3.5 ; A regular assault Rifle is at 5.5, for comparison.",

I think the game has trouble with the sheer amount of projectiles in such a short amount of time. Could be wrong tho.",

            "comment": "The thermal DMR has a fire rate of 5. This means you can shoot 5 times per second which equals roughly 0.2 seconds per shot, so if you try to shoot within that 0.2 seconds between shots it will just drop the input.\n\nIt seems like you're clicking slightly faster than the fire rate. If you slow down your shots slightly you should be fine.",

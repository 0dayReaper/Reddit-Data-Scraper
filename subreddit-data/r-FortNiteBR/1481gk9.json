    "postText": "So my theory is really short but it could explain the connection between Lorenzo and Renzo the destroyer so the theory goes as follows, one day Lorenzo was exploring the jungle before the flip happened and while the flip was happening he got sucked into the zero point and then shot out in the universe where megacity came from and that's why his entire locker has black holes because the zero point where he came from became a black hole",

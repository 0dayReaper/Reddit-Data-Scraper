It's almost always a part of the \"meta\" but should also always have proper counter play. In this game the counter play is someone hunting for players distracted by looting\n\nIf you loot something decent pretty quickly then you have a chance to kill other people in your area before they also find something decent. \n\nThe more time you waste looting more things for marginal gain in power, the more time other players have to also get a decent layout or get lucky. Diminishing returns and all that\n\nAlso by avoiding fights your enemies are consolidating rare drops into the hands of survivors. So a bad player with a rare drop gets killed by a good player with less good drop and now your enemy is someone with good aim and a rare drop \n\nIf you are more aggressive early on then there is a better chance of finding that good player before they have good items and now you have a much better chance to beat them \n\nIt can be tough to find people so you need to balance looting as much as possible *while you actively look for them*. If you too passive in looking then you are effectively doing what you say, farming up resources for the first aggressive player to cross your path\n\nBR games are stupidly straight forward",

It gave him an error but when he tried gifting the bp again it gave an error so we assumed it sent but was being delayed. that was almost two days ago, i\u2019ve checked my account on xbox and on pc, still no gift notif. did my friend (and me) get scammed by a glitch\u2026? ive tried contacting epic support but no response.",

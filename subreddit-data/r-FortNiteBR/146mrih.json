First you get like three rare (or even common, can't remember) fruits that give rare loot. Gradually you get better and better loot in each game and eventually you get mythic fruit with mythic loot. Then it resets.\n\nI liked the loot for sure, but of course everyone else also gets the nice loot, so you didn't get any advantage per se. And the real disadvantage was that you always wanted to land on your tree, making the matches a bit samey.\n\nYou could of course relocate your tree, but you needed the seed for it and if you played trios like me, you had to convince others to relocate too. And the seed takes one inventory space while you're relocating it.\n\nIf you played rarely with your friends, they might have their tree at different location than yours and someone is then missing out.\n\nNone of this is a problem if you don't care about the loot it gives, of course.",

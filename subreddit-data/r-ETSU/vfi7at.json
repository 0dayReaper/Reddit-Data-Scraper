(Not sure if this is the right place to post).\n\nI'm an international student who'll be moving to Johnson City in August for my graduate program at ETSU.\n\nI'm currently searching for affordable student accommodations (or even homestay options) in JC (I'm open to any type of apartment) and I'd really appreciate any recommendations I can get.\n\nLooking forward to your responses. \n\nThanks.",

They charge too much for what they provide, and while it\u2019s not as rundown as some of the other places, it\u2019s expensive, the neighbors are often loud well into the night, and the management is neglectful. The clubhouse closes at the drop of a hat. Any holiday they can justify, they will close for.\n\nHonestly, you might be better off in a dorm. It\u2019s not cheap there, either, but at least food is less of a concern, and quiet hours will actually be enforced",

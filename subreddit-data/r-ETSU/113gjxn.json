    "postText": "Hello! I sent my application for housing in all the way back in October. I didn't actually pay my $100 deposit until November though \ud83d\ude05 I'm worried I may not get into the housing I applied for (Bucaneer ridge). I'm a transfer coming in with my associates. When do housing placements come out? I'm so nervous. Anyone who lives in bucaneer ridge, how hard was it for you to be accepted? When did you find you were accepted to bucaneer ridge?",

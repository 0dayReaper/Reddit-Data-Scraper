We also do game jams and exhibitions at conventions. Our last jam was Ludum Dare 41 where we built a Castlevania/Excitebike hybrid. We've also done ETSU Con and will be at Conapalooza in October. We're open to people at every level of experience, even if you're just curious about the process. Our group is Tri-Cities Game Developers on Facebook and our website is at http://tricitiesgamedev.com Check us out!",

    "postText": "Hello! I am transferring to ETSU for the fall semester and I have the choice to take a calculus or algebra based physics. I really enjoy calculus, but am not sure if I want to dive into a class that is going to take up a ton of brain space and time. I am a biochem major, so I have other intense classes I also need to focus on. Any insight?",

Because it was online and everything though, I can't really speak for how much more of a commitment in person is going to be. \n\nI was also looking forward to using more calculus in the course too, but we really only used calculus tools as proofs and anytime we'd have our own problems we never actually did calculus, so there's that. I can't speak to how a different professor will do things though. \n\nOverall though it's still certainly not a cakewalk and there isn't a ton of benefit to taking it over algebra based. Honestly more than anything you might become just more familiar with concepts by allowing them to be presented with calculus rather than their algebra workarounds.",

One of my friends registered late, but he got Centennial because of other students backing out toward the end. It\u2019s just hoping for lucky timing tbh",

They allow all current residents first pick and Centennial and Buc Ridge usually fill up fastest. I was able to get into Centennial my sophomore year. I will say I cherish my times in Governor\u2019s hall, it really was an awesome experience. Whatever dorm you get i guarantee you will enjoy. Just make sure to find a community of some kind to get involved with. It will make a world of difference.",

I applied suuuuper early as did you and I got placed in Lucy. (Needless to say I ended up living off campus.) If you know who you will be living with I strongly suggest adding a different third of Davis Apartments. Yes you\u2019ll share your space as you would in Gov\u2019s but you still have a kitchenette and a private bath. If I had known that Davis was as nice I would have applied there too. It\u2019s better to have open options than closed and get stuck somewhere you really do not want. I personally have health conditions that would have prevented me from even staying in Lucy as it\u2019s communal bathrooms/showers but housing wouldn\u2019t do anything \ud83d\ude43",

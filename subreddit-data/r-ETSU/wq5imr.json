            "comment": "Grad student here. I\u2019d say one of the biggest mistakes I made when I was a freshman was following other students approach in college. While it\u2019s not fully wrong to do so, it\u2019s better first that you comprehend the university\u2019s system and the way professors work. For example, in the first week, spend time just to learn how to navigate through Goldlink which you\u2019ll be using for registration, pay fees, drop courses, .. etc. D2L that you\u2019ll be using to look into classes live during the semester. Professors unfortunately don\u2019t have certain standards when it comes to using D2L so you must adhere to whatever their way is. \n\nKeep it simple. First week, spend time to review each course\u2019s policy and syllabus. Check what you\u2019re going to learn from each course. \n\nStudy, Study, Study, and then Party whenever you get the chance (HAVE FUN). It\u2019s boring in JC though so it\u2019s quite a good place to just study and you won\u2019t be missing on anything honestly. \n\nDon\u2019t be shy to interact with others, make mistakes, recognize the mistakes, and learn from them. \nYou\u2019ll build lifelong relationships and also you\u2019ll meet bad people so just be kind and make the best out the experience, it actually goes away so fast!\n\nIf you need any assistance, seek help, ETSU as a university has professionals in every aspect who can help.\n\nMy DM is open, if you have any questions or need help let me know :) \n\nTake it easy.\n\nEDIT: wrote this quick so I had to come back and fix some spelling and grammar errors. (Academia) lol",

I just did grad school orientation yesterday and one of the speakers said \u201cYou know when you ask another student how they are and they say fine? That\u2019s a lie, none of are ever fone\u201d and that stuck with me haha. I\u2019ve found most students (and professors) here to be friendly! I\u2019ve also found most people the first week aren\u2019t super talkative so if you don\u2019t feel like being super sociable, I wouldn\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll come more natually the longer you spend in the course (coming from another very shy person). I also wanna say don\u2019t feel pressued to go out and do stuff or get involved with things if you don\u2019t want to. I feel like there\u2019s a lot of pressure to have the \u2018college experience\u2019 but nobody is going to judge you if groups or going to a ton of activities isn\u2019t your style!",

            "comment": "\nGrad student speaking here. \n\n1. Meet with all of your professors for office hours at least one time each semester. This will show them that your actually putting an effort in class and want success, especially when your struggling in their classes. it will also help you get good letters of recommendations for Grad school, scholarships, internships or a job when the time comes which is really important.\n\n2.learn and Utilize all of ETSU\u2019s recourses (career services, tutoring, Food pantry, CPA ect) your never going to have this much access to these recourses in one area once you graduate, so take advantage of it while your here.\n\n3. It\u2019s actually very easy to make friends as a freshman in college even w/ social anxiety. The best ways to make friends in college is to get involved on campus clubs, attending resident hall events( Buc connections, weekly socials ect), joining a living and learning community, and tbh going to parties (you don\u2019t have to drink or go out every weekend, but that\u2019s where you\u2019ll meet the majority of students outside of classes).\n\n4. Start creating a study schedule or a study routine. The best way to be successful in college is to study for each lecture as you go and start working on projects and papers ASAP. Things become stressful when you Wait until the last minute to do these things.",

Over the years, some courses may get added or dropped. New requirements for your degree may be added. You need to stick to this original plan and ensure the university substitutes any dropped courses appropriately and does not require you to add new requirements. I figured this out too late and ended up taking longer than necessary to graduate, costing me more $$$ than it should have. DO NOT just rely on your counselor to set up your schedule like I did at first.",

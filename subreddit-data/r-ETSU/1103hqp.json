    "postText": "I've been thinking about the possibility of transferring to ETSU from UNCC, and wanted to see if it would be worth it. Although I do like the program here as it's pretty good, I really don't like the social/campus side of things at this school. I do really like the campus and activities at ETSU because of the friends I have that go there. Is the Comp Sci program and internship opportunities at ETSU good?",

However, if it is only two or three repeats, then I say go for it! Internships shouldn't be a problem as the program has a special person just for that named Melinda LaPrade. She is really good at placing students with local/regional businesses for internships and with jobs right after graduation.",

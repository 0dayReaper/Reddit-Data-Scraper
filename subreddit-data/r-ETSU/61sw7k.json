It wasn't just one or two bad reviews, there were lots of one stars and most of them had a lot to say. \n\nTerrible parking, faculty doesn't care, school is business before education institution, etc.\n\nI was excited because I was going to get an apartment with my friend and attend but now I'm second guessing.\n\nI want to be a high school history teacher and know lots of teachers where I live currently who attended ETSU. But these reviews on google really scare me off.\n\nCan anyone comment on these/ reassure me?",

Parking , i think , sucks at every campus. \n\nBut i had some incredible instructors during my time there. Including in my undergrad through american history. I feel as i got a very well rounded education. Went business, and throughout my time in the college we worked with local businesses on real world scenarios. Came from UT to here. ETSU is solid, wont feel like you are at a second rate institution. ",

I guess with all colleges it really depends on what degree, but ETSU does have some fairly high accreditation in some areas.  \n",

I do not have any knowledge of the history department regarding teachers but every teacher or professor I've had has been helpful. A lot of the faculty connected to advisement are also very helpful. The only problem I've ran across here is some red tape maneuvering the scholarships but with time, assistance, and perseverance it turned out fine. Do some more research for yourself and be sure to check out the campus and the teachers in person. Good luck in the years to come.",

Also I've had the bursars office lose paperwork and so have some friends. Its all stuff that can be replaced fairly easily but its a pain in the ass anyway. This is a problem that just comes from offices that have a lot of people to deal with. But that doesn't stop it from being annoying.",

Parking is way different on MWF then T/Th. I also was going to be a high school history teacher until I changed to IT. So, believe me when I say that ETSU's history department is down right fantastic. Dr. Burgess and Dr. Maxson are some of the best teachers I've ever had. They were great teachers and also were helpful in my search of a major and career. My advice is to take a collage day and take a guided tour on campus. See if you like the campus and the atmosphere.",

I was in the music program, of which 90% is geared towards training and certification for teachers. The people that left bad ratings are probably just butthurt because they had a professor that actually made them do work. \n\nETSU has some awesome professors and directors. If you're interested in a certain program, look it up on the ETSU website and reach out to their department chairs. They would be happy to give you more info. ",

As others have stated, parking can be awful, but that's typical college life.\n\nHer advisors are always late to meetings, often don't have the information she needs, and are just generally not very helpful.  She's had a couple of teachers that were terrible or always absent and the students had no one educating them but themselves.\n\nThat being said, coming to the end of her program, she's seen the school start to weed out some of those bad teachers and her program has an incredible placement rate. \n\nUltimately, your experience will probably depend on your major and some random luck. I've heard nothing but good things about ETSU's History department.",

Parking is bad, but if people think parking is especially bad at ETSU I would tend to think they haven't tried to park at other colleges, especially UT, which is spread all around Knoxville so you also deal with Knoxville traffic. Overall I loved my time at ETSU and the tri cities.",

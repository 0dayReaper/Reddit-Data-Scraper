    "postText": "I\u2019ve been seeing other colleges, such at UT Knoxville and University of Kentucky, cancel classes/move them online for the rest of the spring semester, as well as cancel graduation. I was curious if anyone has any insight on ETSU\u2019s plans for the rest of the semester. It kind of concerns me that we may have to go back to classes if the corona virus is still running it\u2019s course in nearby cities. Any feedback is appreciated.",

They have a fantastic Hologate Virtual Reality setup that is one of the best attractions there.  They have a full arcade with regular arcade games that are up to date and also ticket winning type games with a full range of prizes you can redeem (even some high end stuff),  a restaurant with really good food, a bowling alley (nicest one in Johnson City), axe throwing and even event rooms for parties. You can watch college sports, NFL and a variety of other sports on several big screen and regular TV's.   If you're looking for something fun to do, check this place out.  You won't be disappointed.  It's in the Roan Centre shopping plaza over by the movie theatre near the mall and behind Truist bank.  You can't miss it.  Great place to take the family or even a date.",

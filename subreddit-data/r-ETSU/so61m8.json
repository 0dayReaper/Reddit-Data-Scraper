            "comment": "Hopefully this isn't super un-helpful, as I did my transfer from UTK to ETSU a little over a decade ago. \n\nAt the time, the majority of my stuff transferred over just fine. There were a few things in the way of core classes that I needed to do different. For example, my \"History\" credits at UTK were Western Civ, but ETSU wanted US. History, so I had to take that. I was not a math guy whatsoever, and squeaked by with College Algebra or something at UTK, and when I transferred, they wanted me to do Probability and Statistics. I took a little time off, because life was a thing, and when I went back in 2016 things had changed enough that whatever math I had at UTK fulfilled my math requirement so I didn't actually have to do Prob/Stats at ETSU. \n\nOther than that stuff, for me the process was pretty seamless. You might get in touch with the Admissions office at ETSU and they may be able to give you more insight. \n\nI'll say that as much as I loved my time at UT, which I really really did (the football team won a national championship my freshman year), I enjoyed ETSU more. \n\nGood luck in your decision, however it goes!",

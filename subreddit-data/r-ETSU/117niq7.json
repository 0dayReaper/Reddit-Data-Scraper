    "postText": "Hello, me and my gf are looking for a new church in the Johnson city area. We\u2019ve both pulled away from our faith due to childhood religion being forced on us and such, so we\u2019re looking for a church that is (preferably) non-denominational and one that has a very active young adult group! Thanks!",

            "comment": "The most open-minded churches in the area that I am aware of are First Presbyterian in Elizabethton, Covenant Presbyterian in JC, St. Johns Episcopal in JC, Holston Unitarian-Universalist in Gray, St. Thomas Episcopal in Elizabethton.  There may be one or two more, but diversity and church is a very small Venn intersection in this area.  As far as active young adult groups, I am not sure, as pretty much all congregations seem to skew older.",

The 11am service is typically 75% students and young families and they have a lot of active study groups of various ages that meet throughout the week. Plus Mainstreet Pizza is right below them so\u2026 bonus lol. \n\nBoones Creek Christian Church, also verse by verse. I have a friend who goes here and the services felt a little like Baptist without the judgement, just chill people, and they have a really active young adult group (18-30ish) that meets separately on Sunday nights if you just wanted to try visiting that. \n\nGrandview Christian Church. This is the more traditional out of the three, but the student ministry I attended at ETSU was sponsored by them and the few services I\u2019ve attended there have been really good. I\u2019m not sure about their young adult program church-side, but if you\u2019re an ETSU student, the Campus House is an amazing group of folks.",

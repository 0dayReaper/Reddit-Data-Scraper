We just did a tour and my son (will be incoming fresh) liked Govs....however if he were to do a LL community (health sciences) he would be in Lucy....which is better LL in Lucy or Govs?  Thank you for your thoughts!",

Govs is %100 nicer it's 60-70 years newer. It's very close to the library, the Culp Center and the campus as a whole. I wouldn't change the experience at Lucy for Govs. At the end of the day he's 18 and will be excited to be living on campus. Let me know if you have any other questions.",

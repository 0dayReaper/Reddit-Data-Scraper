    "postText": "I have been looking for an off-campus place for the fall but have been surprised at how limited the options are for places that are furnished. I feel like Monarch is the only place and there is no way I could ever live there based on horror stories I have been told. I know U-Edge and Student Quarters offer furnished housing but I do not want to room with 2 other strangers with my roommate and U-Edge is pretty expensive. I have been stressed because ETSU Housing said they cannot put my roommate in the room she was in for Spring because they already went and assigned another person because of the \"long Centennial waitlist\". My roommate for this Spring was able to get in last minute though when she came in the Spring and rooms always can end up opening up. I think housing is being a jerk about the situation because the only person there worth talking to who will actually help is Bethanie who is out on medical leave.",

    "postText": "My roommate and I have a room for rent. Rent is $200 a month for the room. Electricity is normally $40 a month, per person. Cable and internet is usually $50 a month, per person. House is located right on Lynn Garden (not the back streets) between 11-W and I-26. One mile from downtown Kingsport. There is a large gravel lot behind the building for parking. All hard wood floors. Bathroom is shared. Washer and dryer in the unfinished basement. The house is pretty big with an open floor plan. The living room is mostly furnished. But feel free to bring whatever you would like. \nMy roommate and I are both in our 20's. We work odd schedules. We are pretty laid back people, easy to get along with. Just looking for someone to help split the bills. \nIf you're a couple and interested, that would be fine. We can discuss splitting the bills accordingly. \nFeel free to call or text me anytime for more information. We would like to meet with you before to make sure we are all comfortable living with each other and to give you an opportunity to see the place before making any decisions. I would be happy to send photos of the room and house. \nMove in date is April first. However, we can discuss a sooner move in date, if you need. We will need first months rent of $200 and a $100 deposit before moving in.",

            "comment": "You're in luck!  Aside from being within an hour to Asheville, the craft beer capital of the country, JC has a nice handful of its own local breweries.\n\nAtlantic Alehouse is a great little spot that has rotating craft selections of both local and regional beers.  It's by a nice park area downtown and usually has a food truck.\n\nYee Haw Brewery is the most established brewery in town and has good beer and good vibes, a bit more energetic than AAH but still pretty chill.  It's attached to White Duck Taco.  The selection doesn't change as much as AAH but everything is brewed there.\n\nJohnson City Brewing Company is down the street and has a very small very chill little place to drink.  It's usually the quietest and most relaxed, and has excellent beer they brew themselves.  Across the street from Main Street Pizza (that also serves craft beer).  I find that JCBC has a lot of good traditional beer styles you won't find elsewhere.\n\nDown the street from JCBC is Little Animals Brewery, which has a larger front of house and a good selection of their own beers.  They get pretty adventurous with their styles so if you like lots of expeimental IPAs and stouts then this is your place.  Atmosphere is always chill.\n\nThere was a place called JRH which had very good beers too, another brewery, but it closed down and then I think was purchased by a distillery, so I don't know what's up with them.\n\nWatauga Brewing is near AAH and is the most party-vibe of the craft breweries and bars in town.  It has good beer and a restaurant I've never been to, but frankly it has a more intense energy that isn't quite my friends and my style, so we usually stick to one of the others.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I prefer craft beers and breweries so that's what I can help you with.  If you're looking for more traditional sports bar and pool halls, I know there's Newman's and Capone's, but I don't know them as well.\n\nThere's one speakeasy I know called The Windsor, near Watauga, if you like cocktails.  I don't know as much about cocktails but I like this place, and people who do know cocktails say they're very good.  Much more expensive than a beer though.\n\nI'm also a grad student.  Out of curiosity, what department/field are you going into?",

                    "comment": "Excellent response, but just want to tack on a bit.\n\nThe former location of JRH was purchased by Tennessee Hills Distillery out of Jonesborough. They recently (around a week and half ago) reopened the location as the Tennessee Hills Brewstillery. I've not had opportunity to check it out, but they did some massive renovations and the pictures I've seen look great. Based on the products at their distillery, I have high hopes. There's a massive renewal project hitting W. Walnut St. (where this is located, extremely close to campus) and the investments being made by Tennessee Hills (they have a distillery project coming, too) are a big part of that.\n\nAnother not mentioned is Barley Waters on the corner of Main and Spring downtown. It's a craft beer taproom but isn't tied to any one particular brand, so if variety is what you're after it's a good place to check out. I'm not much of a beer person, personally, so Barley Waters is a good pick for me as they often have a few different hard ciders on tap as well.",

Sometimes I\u2019ll go to GoBurrito. But if I\u2019m just chilling and not looking for large crowds or commotion, I\u2019ll go to Smokey Bones, Chili\u2019s, or El Charolais. I\u2019m in my late twenties though and not really into the whole wild downtown scene much anymore. But that\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t still go from time to time.",

            "comment": "Tiptons street pub is probably the most popping bar in JC. Wonderland can also get pretty rowdy. Newman\u2019s is ok, has the most space of any bar in the downtown area. Usually where we would go when Tiptons got too busy to get a drink. Downstairs in Capones is the largest dance club. Not my cup of tea, but some people love it. \n\nOutside of downtown there is the Crow Bar, which isn\u2019t nice but it\u2019s a good time and has cheap drinks. Tulips is more of a biker bar if you\u2019re into that. Never been to the Rainbow Asian Cafe but I know people who swear by it. There are also your typical restaurant bars like Applebee\u2019s, Smokey Bones, Mellow Mushroom which are all ok.",

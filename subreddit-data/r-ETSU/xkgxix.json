    "postText": "Please sign my petition to try and have American Sign Language (ASL) recognized as a language at East Tennessee State University in The College of Arts and Sciences. ASL has been recognized in America as a language since the 1960's, and has been recognized in Tennessee since 2017. ETSU needs to catch up and recognize the Deaf Community as having their own culture and language. Please share in Honor of Deaf Awareness Week!  \n\n[https://chng.it/g4TyZDYNCk](https://chng.it/g4TyZDYNCk)",

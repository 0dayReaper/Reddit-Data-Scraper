    "postText": "Potential Barre studio\nHello ETSU! I am a senior graduating in May from VCU and have myself a little idea that I would love your feedback on!\n\nMy grand father has lived in JC for 40+ years and I have grown up visiting there. Over the past 20+ years, I have seen JC urbanize and grow but it\u2019s still missing a few things (that I personally hope to bring). My idea is to bring barre to JC as well as ETSU in the next year or so. \nWhat is barre? It is a ballet inspired work out that creates long &amp; lean muscles. It incorporates Pilates, ballet, and low weight high rep weight lifting. The workout is meant to be the MOST efficient use of one\u2019s time so that they don\u2019t have to spend hours in the gym trying to get the body they want. \nI currently teach spin/indoor cycling in Richmond and also have interest to open an indoor cycling studio. I am divided as to which one I think JC/ETSU needs now. I am aware the university has a wonderful rec-sports facility but I will be aiming to provide morning and evening classes that provides next level fitness to Johnson City! \n\nAgain as I said, any and all feedback would be awesome! ALSO any one interested in becoming a certified instructor for my studio, feel free to contact me via Reddit\u2019s form of messaging. Feel free to pass the word along to friends!\n\n\nEdit: my user name does not reflect my recreational activities, unless we are talking about cooking/baking. Just now realizing my username could stand to be more professional ha!",

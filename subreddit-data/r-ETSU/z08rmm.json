I have messaged the mods multiple times, but they don't respond. \n\nI tried to post again this morning. It got a few upvotes, but then was removed. \n\nSo, if you ever try posting there and don't get any response, they might have just removed your post. (Your posts will always show on your profile section even if they are removed from the subreddit.)\n\nEdit: And now they have banned me without any explanation...\n\nWith a username like /u/Y0urMom, I'm not surprised that they are causing problems. The only other mod there is /u/CedarMadness who isn't very active at all. It's unfortunate that a regional subreddit has such monopolized/fascist moderation.",

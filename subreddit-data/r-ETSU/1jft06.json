    "postText": "Ok so here's the story.. I am transfer student from a college in Georgia (Southern Polytechnic State University) and came here to ETSU in January 2013. I decided to move into building B of the BucRidge Apartments. It was \"decent\" i guess. But! Not the point! At my previous institution, I stayed on campus and they offered godlike ResNet speeds. I'm talking about T3, 80Mbps download and 60mbps upload. Beautiful! Then there is BucRidge.. With a 4 mbps DL and UL. I know the school has at least 1 Gigabit connection. (I believe there is another provider for internet. Don't quote me on that) I was not happy about that. So I wrote a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/mcfeeben/status/305476113164034048) and that was how I vented my feels.  The next day I got an email sent to my student email address that read [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/87QBOrm.png). I was infuriated by this action most because if I am paying the $3,000 dollars for an APARTMENT style dorm, I expect more than below the national average for internet speeds.  I sat down and started writing my ~~short~~ [response](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6iMM79qRzcbVlIwM0RSdjMwN3c/edit?usp=sharing). I then printed it out and hand delivered it to his secretary who then handed it to him, and I just walked away. I waited and waited for him to make contact with me, but nothing. I tried multiple times to go directly to his office and to talk about the situation at hand, but again.. \"he's busy at the time and cannot take guest.\" So instead of waiting for nothing to happen, I went to the SGA and told them about the problem I was having.  I then contacted the OIT departments of multiple universities around ETSU and requested their ResNet speeds, which I also typed up gave to Mark and also the people at SGA who were helping me. [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Os8D89zq4IDDNrD32s3JRyEIafTfTUv6wMUZpIrSfpY/edit?usp=sharing). Couple weeks and and some meetings the [legislation](https://docs.google.com/file/d/1m6G1VXSggK1wQ-72WbkSPMp6RMu-c31C50cOyHvB4PhC0Fw2GcBitKCjUkzV/edit?usp=sharing) was typed up and handed in. Some more time later.. My friend in SGA told me that my legislation had passed and the ResNet speeds will be increased starting this upcoming school year. I am just showing my fellow redditors and ETSU colleagues, that you have the choice to make an impact everywhere and anywhere you go, it just takes time and effort. Go make an impact for the greater good! \n\n**Side note-** I am not a good writer, never have been and most likely won't. So there are going to be lot's of grammatical errors in this text and the links I supplied. \n\n**TL;DR** I was tired of ETSU'd slow internet, wrote the OIT guy in charge a 3 page paper single spaced of why it should be changed. Then went to SGA and weeks later, I eventually got the OIT dept. to increase the speeds.",

That guy's reply is pretty low, too. \n\nI've had many, many arguments with administrators (and have actually lobbied the TN legislature!) concerning changes to TBR and ETSU policies, so yes, changes can happen! This seems to have been handled pretty well on your behalf, so awesome!\n\nIn relation to Internet speeds, I lived off campus for three of my four years at ETSU, and had Charter Internet service, in particular, not their *best* Internet service in terms of speed, but the second tier. It was pretty atrocious. CenturyLink is another ISP, but they couldn't service my apartment, so I didn't have many choices.",

    "postText": "Hello Bucs. Last week during marching band camp I lost my black gym bag in Brown Auditorium, and I've talked to all appropriate lost and founds to no avail. The contents of the bag are rather important to me.\n\n1 phone charger USB type C.\n\n1 red Swiss army pocket knife\n\nAnd 1 Nintendo switch with neon joy cons \n\nObviously the last item listed is the most expensive and very important.\n\nI don't expect much help, and I think I'm out of luck, but I also figured it'd help to have eyes open too.",

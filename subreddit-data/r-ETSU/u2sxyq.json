Any other Halls that have suites where you may know much it is compared to a regular dorm?",

            "comment": "I graduated a couple years ago (still like hanging on the sub though) and I lived in a suite in Carter. I think the rate for the suite is about the same as a standard room (at least it was at the time) the suite rooms are smaller but it does save you from the hall bathroom. There\u2019s also a few \u201capartments\u201d in the basement that are basically a suite but with a full kitchen and bath shared between 2 bedrooms. I lived down there for 3 years and it\u2019s by far the best on campus setup besides Buc Ridge. It costs a little more than the regular rooms though.",

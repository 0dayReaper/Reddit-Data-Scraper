            "comment": "I studied Corporate Financing and Investments with a minor in Accounting. When I went through I really enjoyed it. Had some great professors who had real industry knowledge and many of them were still active in the business community. \n\nThere is an upper level class students can take (if they\u2019re good enough) that they act as advisors to one of our University Funds. They typically compete with other TN schools to see who can have the highest growths. I never took the class (didn\u2019t have time in my schedule sadly) but had many friends who did and I helped them some. It was cool and a lot of fun. \n\nThey\u2019re very much about hands on learning experiences in Finance. An upper level class gives you a $100,000 portfolio to maintain over the semester (not real funds but actual transactions and such basically an advanced simulation). \n\nYou also are required to take all business subjects as prerequisites so super easy to pick up a dual major and/or add in minors you\u2019re interested in.  Leadership has changed since I was there (department chair, college dean, faculty) so not sure to the current climate, but like I said I enjoyed it. There\u2019s so bad professors and some really good ones (as it is anywhere) so just pay attention to Rate My Professor and talk to upperclassmen. Something else to keep in mind is they have a really good internship program.",

Sheri Jervis (jervis@etsu.edu) would be a good place to start as the executive aid for the department.",

Some of the feats rape women, people are pretty rude in general, the windows don\u2019t open for the dorms so the air is absolutely stale 24-7 and you\u2019re forced to be on a meal plan here. Which wouldn\u2019t be so bad if it didn\u2019t make you sick everytime you eat in the dining hall- there have been petitions to change that trust me, but ETSU doesn\u2019t care. All they care about here mainly is their crappy football team. And the area also sucks there\u2019s nothing to do and the closest places with actual stuff is a minimum 1 hr drive. You\u2019ll be bored FAST. Last but not least, there\u2019s not enough parking whatsoever and the drivers are HORRIBLE, multiple people have been hit on campus or you face possibly getting hit every day",

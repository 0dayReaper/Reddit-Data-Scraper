    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI'm an incoming Engineering Technologies major with a concentration in Construction Sciences. I'm buying a new laptop for college, and want to get a MacBook Air. However, I want to make sure all software and programs required for this major would be compatible with an Apple product. If not, what PC should I get? Money isn't really an issue, as I want this to be a good investment that will last me all four years and beyond. \n\nThanks for the advice!",

I think some Airs only come with 4GB, you're going to want that extra memory for sure. The Pro has a model with 16GB if you're set on Mac, but trust me coming from a Mac user myself. If you are not the most tech savvy, Mac's can be a huge pain (IME), I would check out Lenovo's offerings. You'll get just as good of a laptop at half the price.",

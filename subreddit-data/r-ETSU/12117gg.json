I was wondering if there\u2019s any current or former members that could give some insight on the program and experiences and if it\u2019s worth while.\n\nWas it a tight knit community? \n\nWas the room a good size for a roommate or was it too small? \n\nDo you feel like it helped form friendships? \n\nWhat\u2019s some of the extra activities that happen? \n\n\nWas it a burden to participate in the activities or helpful? \n\nDo you recommend going into the program?",

But this post is 6 hours old with no responses, so I figured I\u2019d share my experience.\n\nTight knit community? Yes, I made several close friends during my time with the program.\n\nThe room is a standard shared dorm size. I opted for an off campus apartment nearby.\n\nYes, see above. But that wasn\u2019t my main focus with my studies.\n\nVolunteering, tours of quillen, tours of the VA, community events.\n\nDepends on where you are in your studies. I participated as much as I felt I could. Don\u2019t overextend yourself and put off studying for community events.\n\nYes and no. It helped me realize that I was going into medicine for the wrong reasons. I followed my gut and ended up in a new city for an internship in entomology and now I work for the EPA in DC, which I am very happy about. I don\u2019t regret my decision to leave the program at all.",

Stone Hall is a good starting hall, enjoy the openable windows!!\n3. Yeah friends help\n4. There's always something happening on campus! There are also tons of clubs for you to choose from.\n5. It's always good to get involved in your community\n6. Pre-Health is good!",

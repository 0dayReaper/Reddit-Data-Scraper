    "postText": "I work for a Babysitting company that\u2019s new to Johnson City and right now we have more families than employees and so my boss is giving us $100 for referrals (after they complete their training and work their first shift) and $100 sign on bonuses. It\u2019s a pretty sweet job if you like kids. Ages range from newborns to 12 year olds. Pay is $9.50 I believe but some families pay $10! Also you have an app you download and you have a calendar that you fine tune to your available so you create your own schedule. I only work like once a week or so during the school semester. Anyways lemme know if your interested! \ntl;dr: I want that $100",

I\u2019m hoping to catch some current or past MPH students &amp; ask about their field experiences and what you\u2019ve done/are doing.\n\nI\u2019m scheduled for some interviews soon; I know my *broad* areas of interest, but I don\u2019t know specifically what I want to do during my internship. Mostly because I don\u2019t know what there is to do, even. Really I\u2019m just hoping to get on board with just about anything &amp; get my foot in the door experience-wise. \n\nAdvice??",

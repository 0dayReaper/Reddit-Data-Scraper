    "postText": "Hello \nI plan on traveling to ETSU for the fall semester from Boston to pursue the MPH program. I\u2019ve been trying to do a lot of research but I\u2019ve been struggling to find info so I thought I\u2019d ask my questions here.\n\n1. What is Johnson City like, especially since I\u2019ve never been to Tennessee before. And would it make a decent place to live after graduating?\n\n2: How difficult is it to find an internship in the area? It seems like a small city so I\u2019m concerned with this.\n\n2: I planed on flying out to the tri-cities airport from Boston since it\u2019s fairly close to the campus, but I was wondering if there was any shuttle bus services or Public transportation, that could take me from the airport to campus or at least to the city, and if not is Uber or taxi reliable in the area?",

But they sort of roll the sidewalks up early. It gets really quiet at night. \n\nNo idea about internships. \n\nNo public transport from the airport. The Uber situation here can be spotty. But car rental may be easier. \n\nLOT to do in the area.  Hope you enjoy.",

You can still swim in the lake but the evenings are great for fires. The region is growing tremendously within the next four years. I would think that you would be able to find a job. \n\nETSU does a very good job of finding internships for students. They also may provide you a shuttle transportation from the airport. I would suggest checking with your advisor.",

My advisor told me most students choose to leave there area since there\u2019s not many opportunities in the local area. Although I\u2019ve never visited or been to Tennessee before.",

    "postText": "Hey all, I know this subreddit isn't frequented a lot but I figured there's no harm in taking advantage of something that's free. Gotta start somewhere? But not Craigslist.\n\nI'm looking to produce an original play and I'm starting to put some feelers out for talent and personnel. I'm starting from scratch; I need a director, seven or eight principals, and a couple crew folks.\n\nI'm looking to do a Friday and Saturday night show with a dress rehearsal on a Thursday. This will be performed in Kingsport, TN, most likely in late September. **This is a paying gig:**\n\n* Director - $300\n\n* Actors - $100 (6 men of varying ages, 1 young woman)\n\n* Crew - $50 (def need a light guy, may or may not need sound, and two stage hands for set changes)\n\n* Set building - depends on what we need and may vary based on the director's vision, but shoot me your information if you do this sort of thing I will definitely get in touch with you by June\n\nI've x-posted to the ETSU sub as a place to maybe find a younger man and woman to play two of the principals. Another role is not particularly age dependent and could go to someone college-age if they're the right fit.\n\nI'm trying to begin by looking for a director; it's the best place to start since he/she will be the quarterback calling a lot of the shots. I'd like to have a conversation to see how you envision staging the work and to get a sense of your management style. I'll then step back and let you do your thing, I won't breathe down your neck or second-guess you once I know we're starting on the same page.\n\nI do want to caution that I am looking for a director with a decent amount of experience. I'm mainly x-posting on this particular sub for actors and crew, or for any ETSU readers to possibly reach out to community theatre people that they might know. If you've helmed several plays before, we can talk, but you'd really have to know what you're doing.\n\nBut I also put the rest of this info up in case any other interested people want to audition or help out. Go ahead and shoot me your contact information and I will get back in touch with you in the coming weeks/months. No bamboozles, I just need to nail down a director first. We'll then starting contacting for people for auditions.\n\nSo if you know someone who might be interested, please let them know! And point me in the right direction if you know a better place to get this information out there. I'll be x-posting to the other local subs as a start but I'll take any suggestions if there are places my energies might be better directed.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Crew?\n\nIf you were looking to direct, can you tell me about your previous experiences? PM me and I'll be happy to chat with you.\n\nAlso, for anyone else who may read this: I've realized in retrospect that it may not be clear above that I already have a specific script in hand that I am looking to produce. To be clear, I'm not *looking for a play* to produce; I *have one I am looking to produce*. I apologize if my wording was confusing.",

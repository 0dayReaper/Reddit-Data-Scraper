We're hoping that /r/TennesseePolitics turns into a forum for real discussion and makes it easier to keep up with the news.\n\nOnce we hit 500 subscribers we're looking into starting an AMA series with various candidates, journalists, etc.  Let me know if there's anyone in particular we should reach out to!",

It's one thing for the Xboxs and PS3s not to work with the wifi, but completely blocking us from the internet is pretty shitty.",

It seems that over the weekend RES NET has changed their router/firewall policies. that is out of our control, the best thing I can recommend is that you do not NAT your internal LAN. Make sure you are getting an IP from their dhcp and not your own router. All we can do is wait to see if they change it back or fix it. If it doesn't get resolved within a few days, we will ask our administrator about it. \n\nUpdate: It seems that steam is working again. Anyone else confirm?\n",

                            "comment": "I used to be a RA in buc ridge, and on regular campus. I now have graduated and moved off campus.\n\nFor on campus: Resnet tm internet connection is usually in the ball park of 200kb/s download. This increases at evening hours because they offload a lot of the bandwidth from the offices to the residence halls for overnight downloads for projects. The latency is actually quite good. In most applications requiring constant internet (skype, gaming, etc) you will see a 25-40ms latency time which is acceptable.\n\n\nOff campus you have three real options: Xfinity/Comcast, century link DSL, and Charter Spectrum. If you live on the east side of Johnson City, you have access to Charter, which is around 55$ a month for 60mbps which is a coaxial cable with good latency (10 mb/s download), Comcast offers the same exact plan (except with a 1tb data cap, which honestly isn't too bad), but for the west end of johnson city.\n\nCentury link offers DSL for $30 a month that is 15 mbps, you're looking at a small, but comfortable for internet browsing at around 600kb/s. The kicker is DSL lines do not share upload speed well. So if two people are trying to connect to say...youtube or facebook, you will notice SEVERE lag. Therefore, it is best to fork up the extra $15-20 and go for Charter/Comcast.\n\n\nHope this helps.",

I'll try to find somewhere where Charter is available, because I don't at all trust myself to stay under 1TB/mo. \n\nBut it's awesome to know that worst case scenario I'll still be able to do the work/gaming I usually do at Buc Ridge.\n\nThanks again, you've been a big help.",

My wife streams netflix from 4pm-8pm every single night when we watch television together. I also update all my applications everyday, watch youtube videos in 1080p that can be hours long on projects.\n\nThe most we have ever went is 350gb, and I was also running a server out of our house.... just to show you a ball park. Unless you 24/7 stream a 4k movie service, I wouldn't sweat it. \n\nThe only bad part is giving comcast your money since they don't care one bit about the consumer.",

Should be no issue as long as I mind the larger downloads.\n\nI'm still a bit undecided since I haven't had any solid bites from local apartments, so if you're ever around and would be willing to let me pick your brain about Buc Ridge for a few minutes I'd love to hear your take. This sub seems a bit split as far that place goes.\n\nI'd be happy to buy you a beer when I make it into town for all the help.",

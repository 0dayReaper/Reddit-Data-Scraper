    "postText": "So, a few of you probably remember the [Big Frakkin LAN](http://imgur.com/d4HNEY2) party that happened a year and a half ago hosted by the ETSU ACM chapter. And those guys set the bar pretty damn high, because they had a great turnout and everyone was having a blast. I mean that's cool and all, but me being the current ETSU ACM Webmaster, I want ACM to team up with a few other organizations on campus like [EDGE Club](https://www.facebook.com/pages/EDGE-Club-at-ETSU/141169965921052?ref=br_tf), [Anime Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/buccaneeranime/), and the [ETSU eSports Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/413682542047816/?ref=br_tf) (And I will try to talk to some organizations at University of Tennessee). In doing this, I want to SMASH that event we called a LAN party a year ago. I believe a everyone reading this knows about ETSU Comic Con and how the LoL tournament was sponsored by nVidia and Riot Gaming. I will try to get in contact with these guys and a few other companies as well to have this event sponsored as well. (I have someone with an IN with Blizzard)\n  \n  \n  Which means no more musty Wilson-Wallis Basement, no power surges during the middle of our League matches, and no network connection problems when playing.  It would be kind of the same thing as last year. Bring your Tower/Laptop/Magic Card/Robe and Wizard Hat/ etc./  \nTo get into the event will be $7 pre-pay and $10 at the door (If we get a lot of interest, then we can go to $5/$7) Of course there will be food and drink and snacks as well.\n  ****\n **My ideas so far for the tournaments:**  \n1. League of Legends.  \n2. Smash Brothers (You all choose which one(s))  \n3. Counter Strike: Global Offense  \n4. Pokemon  \n5. Dota?  \n6. Open to recommendations  \n  \n  ****  \nOk, so your heard my pitch, now let me know what you all think of this idea. Are you interested? Would you want something else big in the tournament lineup? When would you want this to happen? (After mid-terms seems cool to me) Just let me know guys and girls!  \n-Ben Lee McFee  \n  \nPS - *Ignore my grammar mistakes.*",

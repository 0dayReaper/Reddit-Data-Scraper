Maybe our subreddit logo and then /r/ETSU in text under it. Idk.. but it would be a cool portfolio builder and if it would be successful, I\u2019d provide you our user statistics from before advertising vs. after. Might not seem like much but HR eats that shit up if you provide that data in an interview.  \n  \nI\u2019ll need to get approval from SORC, but I have some people I can contact to push that through.

Use their help to find internships and possible scholarship opportunities and **do them.** Nothing, and I mean nothing is more important than finding an internship before your senior year and networking with professors who can help you.\n\nGood luck out there!

He apparently mods here so //waves//  Anyways, _super_ late response, but there are two really awesome DIGM clubs you can join to get to know your fellow students if you haven\u2019t had any success yet. They both meet at the DMC, which is across the walking bridge and behind all that construction. \n\nThe first is EDGE Club, kind of a chill/professional development type club, they\u2019re the ones who host Speakers from the industry over Skype throughout the semester. EDGE meets on Thursdays at 8pm\n\nThe second is the Gaming Communities Club, and is exactly that. On Fridays at 7:30 we take over room 290 and set up things like N64 Mario party, Halo, Overwatch, League, etc. We usually also have various card games and snacks. \n\nAgain, this is like a month and a half later so idk how helpful the info is to you at this point, but there you go",

For the HiD program, the level of work/effort was so very worth the scholarship funding, and I know that many of my friends in the honors scholars program felt the same way. I\u2019m less familiar with the performing arts scholarship program, unfortunately. \n\nThe honors college added so much to my ETSU experience, and is one of the primary reasons I\u2019ve been so successful in my career.",

I\u2019m currently a senior research mathematician at the [Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab](https://www.jhuapl.edu/)\n\nYou may know us as the organization that built the covid-19 dashboard, for instance. \n\nI started at APL after getting my PhD about four years ago!

Aside from the undergraduate thesis project, most everything was like an extra semester-long project, or 2-3 small research papers spread out over the semester. I'd say the extra work is worth it, especially relative to the perks: occasional free food, special lab privileges, scholarship money, priority enrollment, and even travel expenses when I asked to go to an out-of-state conference.  \n  Obviously, your mileage may vary, but I think it is a good program worth involving yourself in if you are able.",

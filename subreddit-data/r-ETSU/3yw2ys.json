    "postText": "Hi! Im a potential transfer student coming from california and one problem I'm having at my current school is trying to enroll in the classes i need but due to a huge student population and limited resources no one can get into the classes they need without priority registration. How is it like getting into classes for biology majors? Is it hard, meh, or easy? Is there a waitlisting problem? I'm also considering minoring in music ed. ",

You have to register early as soon as you can like any other college though. \n\nFor my degree, I minored in music and would advise against it.  Music classes are extremely time consuming for little credit hours. The politics and mind games played by a lot of the professors in the department are really tough to get through, especially if you are trying to get a real degree in a hard subject like Biology.  If you are any good at your instrument, you could get a scholarship but you have to agree to a lot of terms, a lot of which is your precious time to be in ensembles that take away from studying Biology.  Just learn your ear training, composing, conducting on youtube from better teachers.  ",

For bio majors here, the requirements are set up a little differently.\n\n There are 5(?) Required areas of courses: molecular, population, organismal, and some others I can't recall. There are 7-10 classes under each area (some being in more than one area). And you have to take 1 (or more depending on your concentration) from each area along with the usual prerequisite courses. (Bio 1,2,3. Genetics. Gen chem 1-2. Physics 1-2. Organic chem 1-2). \n\nThe biology department here is actually outstanding. I have loved every course I've taken. I've taken everything from cell biology to general entomology (study of insects). All of it hasq been wonderful. \n\nI am about to graduate and I am attending the med school here in the fall. The biology department has prepared me very well! Good luck! Hope you attend! Go bucs!",

I had priority registration as honors, so never had an issue, but I never heard of anyone having any trouble aside from Freshmen and sometimes Sophomores for some of the bigger and more popular classes.",

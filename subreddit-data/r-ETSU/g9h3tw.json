If it's a small department and a high level class, the professor probably knows everyone in the room. If the class typically has a bunch of freshmen from you'd have a chance even in a regular room, assuming you show up the first day. \n\nEarly on if you get caught and can act like you're in the wrong room. It'll be more difficult later. You'll have to figure out how to handle tests and other work that might get turned in or returned during class.",

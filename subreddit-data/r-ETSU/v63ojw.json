I noticed on the ETSU website that Prof. Thomas Crofts teaches the Ancient Greek track but all his rate my professor reviews are on his English courses. \n\nAlso interested in hearing experiences in Latin and other classical studies courses. \ud83d\ude01",

Antiquity wasn\u2019t my speciality, but I do know that Doug Burgess, who teaches Ancient History (and is also chair of the department) is super smart and an extremely chill dude. Don\u2019t know how much history your course of study would involve, but Dr. Burgess is definitely one of the coolest professors I had at ETSU.",

            "comment": "I completed my B.A. in Spring '21, having majored in History and minored in Classical Studies. I chose Latin as my language rather than Greek and was very pleased with the language courses. The woman that teaches the Latin courses has a unique teaching style I wasn't sure about at first, but a few weeks into the first of four semesters I was sold. She also integrates a lot of historical facts and trivia into her courses, courtesy of her husband who teaches history courses at nearby Northeast State Community College.\n\nHaving said all of that, I do know Dr. Crofts and he's an extremely likeable person. I did have him for a special topics course that delved into modern adaptations of Homeric stories. In the classroom, he can be a bit dry but he is very knowledgeable. He is also the director for the minor, so you will be interacting with him regularly from that angle as well.\n\nAs mentioned in another comment, the chair of the Department of History \u2013 Dr. Doug Burgess \u2013 is a Classicist, and an extremely knowledgeable one at that (as well as being rather sharp in both Latin and Greek.) All of the courses he teaches can be applied to the Classical Studies minor as electives (the bulk of the minor is made up of electives and there are many choices beyond those listed on the program's website) and, having had a couple as an undergrad and having worked with Dr. Burgess in a variety of capacities, you can't go wrong.\n\nI am currently between my first and second years of ETSU's M.A. History program and working on my thesis (as well as having completed a Graduate Certificate in Appalachian Studies this past Spring,) so if you have any questions please feel free to ask either here or in a direct message \u2013 I may very well have an answer for you!",

            "comment": "Took the 1000-level Greek courses way back in 2011-2012. This was RIGHT before they added a Classical and Medieval Studies minor. The course then was pretty self-guided and I think it was only beginning to be hammered out. I have heard great things about Dr. Crofts but unfortunately never got to speak to him while I was taking Greek. \n\nI was a history major and studied under Dr. Burgess and preferred his classes to most. I took History of Rome, Ancient Religions, and History of Christianity with him and the courses were generally all laid out the same. Interesting lectures in class and a self-guided research project that would either take the whole semester or be broken up into two over the course of a semester. He was very knowledgeable and *always* available to discuss anything during or after class and he held very accommodating office hours, too.",

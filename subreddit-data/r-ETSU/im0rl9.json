    "postText": "ETSU just sent this email to all students, does anyone know what the flyers were? I understand not wanting to spread their message, but not giving any information other than \"We are increasing are security presence in response\" is scary.  \n    \n-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \nEast Tennessee State University has learned that flyers have been placed on some cars in parking lots on campus. The message of these flyers does not align with the mission and values of East Tennessee State University. These flyers were distributed without permission, and the placement of temporary signage on vehicles is prohibited by university policy.  Our campus is a place of inclusion and a place where people are treated with dignity and respect.  \n  \nYour safety is our highest priority.  I recognize that the message of these flyers may be troubling to some people.  Our campus has resources available for any student, faculty or staff member who might need assistance.\n\nPublic Safety has been notified and additional security patrols are in place.  Should you have any information about this incident, please contact ETSU Public Safety at 423-439-4480.",

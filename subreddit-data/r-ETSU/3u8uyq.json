I'm hoping to have it restored for two weeks to migrate everything.\n\nI'm not 100% clear if they realize it needs to be restored in addition to an extension. The guy I talked to said 120,000 accounts were deleted, and it sounded as though some notifications didn't go out.\n\nThank you for responding after I resurrected a 7 year old comment lol.",

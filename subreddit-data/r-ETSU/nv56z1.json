The phone option can get very busy at times, especially around the start of a semester (Summer started yesterday). Email is usually relatively quick to respond, though, even in busier times. Try both avenues and they should be able to get you sorted out; there may be some extra information/etc. they need from you before things can be finalized. Good luck!",

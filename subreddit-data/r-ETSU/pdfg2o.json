    "postText": "\nHi Everyone,\n\nI have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/ETSU) and I am really excited to share it with you.\n\nYou can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in, as well as filter courses by department and level and compare these courses. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking and know what to expect.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything that I should change or what features I should add.\n\nLastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.\n\nEnjoy!!",

            "comment": "I see a few issues from the get go that may complicate sorting and such. At ETSU, many departments have course codes that apply to more than one course. HIST 4/5117, for example, is Topics in European History and is used for a wide variety of one-off courses and courses only offered occasionally. There were two planned for this semester: Charlemagne &amp; the Formation of Europe (which had to be cancelled) and Stalin (which isn't listed on your site, I imagine because of this exact issue). You can clearly see in just the small sample size how varied the topics are across this single course code.\n\nThe same example can be used to highlight another issue as well: split-level courses. These courses are offered as both graduate and undergraduate courses with shared sections/lectures/etc. with the differences generally being only a somewhat increased workload for graduate students.",

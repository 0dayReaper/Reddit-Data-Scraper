There will also be plenty of vendors and artists as well! On top of that, we have Eric Stuart (voice of Brock and James from Pokemon, and voice of Kaiba from Yu-gi-oh) coming, an Art of Akira exhibit, and a panel with NASA contractors and Sci-fi enthusiasts talking about Science Fiction influencing actual space travel! \n\nStudents are free and all others are $5 pre-reg and $10 at the door! April 27th, 10 AM-10PM! \n\nThe website's here at: http://www.etsucon.com/\n\nHope you guys can come! :)\n\n",

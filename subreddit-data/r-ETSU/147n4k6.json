I\u2019ve been looking on the website where they are advertised but haven\u2019t been seeing much on there. I\u2019m going into the Applied Data Science M.S. program. Does the library ever hire GAs? Thanks :)",

I did email the assistant dean of my upcoming program to let her know I was interested in TS/GA spot, and she told me when they would put me on the list for when they start looking at the fall. \nI'm hoping maybe once summer is more than halfway over they'll have more.",

            "comment": "There's a lot of divisive feelings about Greek life at ETSU, and some of the organizations have had legal trouble in the last few years. If you decide to rush for a frat go in with open eyes. \n\nThat said, there are a lot of other campus organizations that you can get involved with to meet people, build connections, and - if you're feeling really ambitious - even make ETSU a nicer place to be. Just look around campus at flier walls and online. \n\nGeneral freshman advice: there's no rush to pick a major. Take your time and figure out what you enjoy. Chat with your classmates. Go to your professors office hours. Go to the gym. Give a shit. Party as needed. There's free tutoring in the library, free birth control in the clinic, and free counseling available if you need it. If you think you might want any of those things, just go. It's not a big deal. \n\nGo Bucs",

The larger one currently being Phi Mu Alpha. Several marching band members are in it. If you're interested feel free to shoot me a dm.",

The main social ones I recall now being SAE and Sig Ep. There are a few other smaller honors fraternities, or, like ours, music fraternities on campus but I don't remember all the names. Google can help you out!",

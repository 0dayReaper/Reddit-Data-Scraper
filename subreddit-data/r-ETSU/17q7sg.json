No one has bothered to ask the faculty, but for what it's worth, I don't think this is a good idea. \n\nMy students are struggling to get into the classes they want because we don't have enough teachers to meet their needs.  I think most of my students would rather graduate on time than pay an extra $250 a year for D2 football season tickets.  I might be wrong though, what do you guys think?",

There was no real sense of school spirit back then either, even when we had football. \n\nHardly anyone went to the games.  And, this is likely because most students commute to campus rather than live on campus.\n\nThe university has done nothing to fix those issues (not that they really can) and they are not likely to do so.  Football will fail at ETSU again and become and unnecessary burden upon students and the university.\n\n",

There are 4k more students now, and a good number more living on campus and the number of student apartments near campus has grown tremendously. They wont be in the Dome, which was an awful place to watch a game. The general atmosphere seems to have changed as well. Maybe it was just the guys I ran with, but most students today seem far more involved than back then (student groups seem larger and more active among other things). I dont know that its changed enough to support the team in the long run, but its better than it was in 03 just by my observation. I hope it has, because having a good football program can really help a school out. It can garner more attention and help fund other programs. \n\nThe OP made a very good point about the number of teachers though. We really dont have enough, but thats not going to change whatever happens with football. They wouldnt take that 250 per year and apply it to new hires anyway. The best thing for that will probably be the Northeast State center opening up downtown. If they can staff it enough that could take a lot of pressure off the core classes and free up people to teach upper division courses. \n\nOverall, ETSU is growing rapidly and I think having a football program will be good in the long run.

So, I don't think the housing situation on campus has really changed that much.  It definitely has to be better quality, but I don't know about number of beds.  Enrollment has definitely increased, but we still are primarily a commuter campus.\n\nIn theory, the increase in student population should also have affected the basketball games.  But, I think the attendance for basketball games is about the same as it was in 2002/2003.  If there was an increase, it's hard to tell.  This is just my observation, I don't actually have numbers.\n\nThe Dome was/is a horrible place to have a game. An outside field may definitely attract more people.  I, myself, have actually attended a soccer game just because it was easy to access.  So, I could buy that argument.  \n\nAs long as they still try to have games on Saturdays, UT games will always steal away spectators.",

Even still, there are a lot more apartments next to campus that could supply a ready fanbase. I wonder how it worked out with the baseball field right next to those new apartments? \n\nIm not sure why basketball attendance hasnt risen. My theory is that its just not a popular sport around here. I went to Science Hill back when they had a crap football team and an awesome baskeball team (under Coach Pitts) and people showed up to football games but not basketball games (well, not as many anyway). Maybe its an area thing? \n\nI wonder if ETSU will do what Tusculum did and avoid UT game days. Schedule games on Thursdays or, possibly, if they have a late game schedule it for us as a morning game. Also, if the school down the road stays crappy that will help our program. \n\nAs you said in your first sentence, though, Im probably just being optimistic. I love football, and ETSU, so I really hope both take off. That might be clouding my judgement. ",

I like how one of the members of the 125 Committee said that he wanted \"5,000 or 6,000 or 7,000 alumni on campus for games\". Yeah, our current parking situation means that won't be a nightmare for the actual students and staff. \n\nI do get why Noland did it though. It is far more financially lucrative to him to be President of a D2 school than one without a football program. ",

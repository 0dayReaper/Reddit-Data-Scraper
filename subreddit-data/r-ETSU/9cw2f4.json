            "comment": "This is an important piece that people often forget when attending school. It was especially hard for me to make new friends as a transferring Sophomore from a college in Georgia.  \n  \nTaking advantage of ETSU sponsored events are great for meeting new people. I found that joining the ACM club and eSports Club lead to many great friendships. I even got to help put together LAN Parties for fellow gamers to come and play some Casual/Competitive games.  \n  \n  Not saying you HAVE to join a club to make friends. I'm saying you HAVE to take a leap of faith and get out of your comfort-zone to start the process.  \n \nIf you're still having a tough time with this or just feeling lonely, reach out to me and I'll be more than happy to meet up and talk or listen! No one should have to feel like they are not wanted/lonely.  \n  \nYour Mod,  \n-mcfeeben",

ETSU has failed in this aspect. My freshman year I had a solid connection and fast internet getting around 20-40 mps. This semester and the beginning of last I get around 1.3-2.9 mps. While apogee advertises an internet speed of 100 mps download and upload speed they have failed to deliver. \nPersonally I find this unacceptable and the school needs to address that students deserve good internet with how much we have paid for tuition.",

                    "comment": "From when they initially installed the internet IT was told they were unable to do anything and my issues were to be resolved through apogee alone. This has been campus wide from what I can understand as some of my friends in three different campus dorms have reported the same issue. I tried having IT help and they said they couldn\u2019t and that\u2019s when I called apogee and they have been entirely unhelpful. Essentially their argument is that it\u2019s my computer limiting the bandwidth which  I know is just false as when I use my desktop over the summer when I return home it never has issues and runs around 20 mps.",

    "postText": "Howdy Buccaneer Nation,\n\n I'm moving out of town and am looking for someone to take over my lease at Student Quarters Johnson City for the **spring semester ONLY!** This means the lease would be from January through May (5 months of rent). I have 1 bedroom in a 4 bedroom/4 bathroom apartment. Rent plus Utilities come out to $480 a month. The place is fully furnished and within walking distance of campus! My roommates have been terrific and always keep the place spotless.\n\nIf you are interested or have any questions, please DM me!\n\nAdditionally, one of my roommates is also looking for someone to take over his lease, so if you have a friend, y'all can both move in together!",

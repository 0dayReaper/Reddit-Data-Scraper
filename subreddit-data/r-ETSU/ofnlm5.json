    "postText": "hi. i am going to be graduating high school in 22', and i'm currently in a frenzy to find colleges to apply to. i am pretty set on the east tennessee area, and trying to find the best option for me.\n\ni slightly prioritize experience over education, so in your opinion, does ETSU provide the stereotypical \"college experience\"? is there any party culture, and how is the student life on campus? as for outside campus, are social opportunities/events in johnson city easy to come across? \n\nas for the quality of education, i've heard that it is hit or miss with the courses at ETSU. i have a vague idea of what i want to major in, but will definitely minor in journalism. how is the access to resources on campus? \n\nif you have any personal pros or cons about ETSU, or even some advice for choosing another college to focus on, please share. thank you :)",

            "comment": "College is what you make it, and there are plenty of chances to have a great college experience. If you have access to the funds, stay in a dorm to meet new people freshman year, consider Greek life, and maybe join an intramural team or two. I majored in Chemistry and enjoyed the department. I can\u2019t speak to the journalism program, but I do know a few local journalists who went to ETSU. \n\nNightlife is fun, although the best under-21 bar shutdown (RIP Poor Richards). You can still get into Capones for the time being, if that\u2019s your thing. You\u2019ll be able to find parties at Campus Ridge, University Edge, and Monarch which are basically off-campus student housing. When you turn 21 you\u2019ll have access to several great breweries. Great local restaurants such as Cootie Browns, Holy Taco, Label, and Southern Craft are very close to campus. \n\nWhile the sporting events aren\u2019t anywhere near the level of SEC or ACC competition, the games are still fun to attend. There\u2019s usually a competitive basketball team, and football games provide a good experience. \n\nCollege is what you make it, and the extent to which you have a \u201cgreat college experience\u201d is really on you. If you get out and try new things, meet new people, and get involved with things you\u2019re interested in that will be your experience. If you sit in the room and play video games all day that will be your experience.\n\nOne more thing since this is getting lengthy, make sure you balance the experience and the education. It\u2019s good to have \u201cclass friends\u201d and \u201cafter class friends.\u201d These aren\u2019t always mutually exclusive, but its good to have friends taking the same classes as you. It will hold you more accountable and make studying fun. Some of my favorite memories from college were hanging out in the library all night before an exam or a big report being due. If you can maintain this balance, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy the experience for four years rather than one or two. \n\nGood luck and go Bucs!",

Had a lot of fun with organized groups like preview/orientation, fraternities, and other student groups through my major. I also was able to meet some of my best friends to this day through dorms and apartment living. No shortage of bars and restaurants, but the best part is you're literally an hour or so away from bigger cities like Knoxville or pigeon forge or Abingdon. Tons to do.\n\nPlus the hiking in the area is outstanding. Tons of trails and lakes if that's your thing.",

Ultimately you\u2019ll get back as much as you put in, but the way the DigM program is structured will set you up for success. The two major benefits are:   \nA) They teach you a broad spectrum of softwares and industry techniques as part of the overall Digital Media degree (which, fun fact, is a Bachelor of Science, not art). This helps you get your foot in the door because while you will still have your concentration specialties, you can wear a lot of other \u201chats\u201d which makes you a very attractive hiring candidate.    \nB) Both the program and the lab is set up to mimic an industry environment. During your senior year (or earlier if you make friends with older classmates and they drag you in) you\u2019ll have the opportunity to join \u201cproduction\u201d classes that create projects for outside clients and you can graduate with 1-2 years of \u201cexperience\u201d in your given field already under your belt.",

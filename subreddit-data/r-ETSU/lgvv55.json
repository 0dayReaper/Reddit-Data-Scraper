    "postText": "Howdy, I am a current ETSU grad student and am coming to visit the week 2/22 - 2/26 from Texas. I was wondering if there were any recommendations for food, hikes, things to do, etc. in the area. I will also be staying in Downtown Nashville and off of Beal St in Memphis. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Wouldn\u2019t be opposed to meeting new people in the Strength and Conditioning field or just new people in general! Thanks in advance!",

I never went to downtown Memphis that often. I mainly hung around East Memphis, Midtown, and in the burbs. Also, one of the best zoos in the country is there if you were interested.",

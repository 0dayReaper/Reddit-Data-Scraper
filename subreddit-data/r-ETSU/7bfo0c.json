Just got an email about it\n\nedit: found my answer thans to /u/dbadaddy \n\n\"Some of the flyers, however, were posted directly over and adjacent to literature advertising tonight\u2019s appearance of Opal Tometi, a Nigerian-American writer, political strategist and community organizer who co-founded Black Lives Matter, a controversial organization in racial justice politics. Those flyers included such statements as \u201cIT\u2019S OKAY TO BE WHITE,\u201d while others promoted the Traditionalist Workers Party, a white nationalist organization. Noland\u2019s statement said no information was available regarding who posted them\"",

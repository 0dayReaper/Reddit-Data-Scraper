The equipment room is absolutely brutal to deal with. I run a Sony A7sII with some newer lights and rode shotgun/lavs",

If you are driven to create and network then you can make it work. If you\u2019re looking for some easy degree to waste money on then it is also the way to do it. It\u2019s completely up to you to take advantage of what it is. With that said I am grateful for some of the professors and colleagues I\u2019ve met along the way. The equipment room on the other hand has never been beneficial to me. I had to take that aspect into my own hands.",

I don't have much faith in what schools provide after seeing the equipment they provide, so it feels like I dodged a bullet. \n\nanother question might i ask would be about sort of creative restrictions in the department. since you're creating a thesis, i'd assume there's a list of types of shots, certain elements in the story, etc. but if i'm not majoring in that category (Communication Studies major with FPA Honors minor is my focus), do you think whatever guidelines they ask for still apply to me?",

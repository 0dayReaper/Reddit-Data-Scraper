I mean technically you could probably dissemble them but I'm not sure why or where you'd put in and you'd most likely end up in trouble with an RA or in worst case scenario a disciplinary hearing. They can be adjusted up and down and move around the room anyway you want but even if you were to get them dissembled you'd have no place to put it. And you have to have EVERYTHING remain in the room, hate that stupid chair that comes with the dorm and brought your own? Well throw it in the closet or find someone who needs extra's chairs and get it back by the end of the semester/checks.",

    "postText": " \n\nHello everyone! I am a BLS AHA (American Heart Association) CPR/AED instructor. I am posting a link to the form below to gain some insight into how many people would be interested in a CPR class in our area. There are multiple versions of the course to choose which will satisfy job requirements for a variety of disciples such as healthcare workers, industry workers, babysitters, daycare workers, lifeguards, fitness workers, etc., or just people who want to learn CPR such as new parents!\n\nIf you are interested in possibly attending a course please click the link below to fill out the information questionnaire. Thank you!\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/220807808063152",

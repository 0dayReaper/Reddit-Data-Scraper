            "comment": "The school is pretty hit or miss depending on the program and the professor. The nursing school as I understand it pretty competitive. \n\nStudent life is ok - they just finished a lot of construction on campus and rejuvenated some of the big buildings. A lot of students don\u2019t live on campus though, so the Etsu experience is more about the community (and I wouldn\u2019t recommend living on campus - it\u2019s crazy expensive)\n\nThere are good student support services at ETSU, so it\u2019s easy to get plugged into clubs and get free tutoring for academics. The football program is fairly new and we don\u2019t win very often, but games are still fun social events. \n\nJohnson City is a nice town with a lot of new local business and nice public spaces. It\u2019s pretty safe anywhere in town. We\u2019re 45 minutes from Asheville, so there\u2019s usually plenty of music/hipster stuff going on and lot of local hiking and camping. (Of course a lot of that is shut down currently, but that\u2019ll pass eventually). \n\nUTK is a huge urban school with a big party reputation. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it unless that\u2019s the experience you want. The other schools I\u2019ve heard mostly nice things about. \n\nHonestly just pick the cheapest one that has the program you want and you like the city it\u2019s in. Don\u2019t go into debt for a bachelors degree if you can help it.",

            "comment": "I just graduated and want to say I thoroughly enjoyed my time at ETSU. First off, the campus is beautiful with a lot of green spaces for students to hang out (and they do, it\u2019s not just for show). They just finished remodeling the student hub building and it\u2019s gorgeous and has a bunch of great food places. There are many unique options and clubs available for student involvement alongside the standard frats and sororities. Additionally, the whole city seems to work with the school so you\u2019ll find many business and restaurants have some sort of special deal for students, as well as a lot of community activities available if you want to get involved outside of campus. (Side note, the entire city bus system is free for students so even if you don\u2019t have a car you can go just about anywhere.) \n\nFor the classes themselves, as the other commenters have mentioned, it really just depends. My personal experience was amazing, but I was part of a smaller department so everyone knew each other and acted kinda like family. Gen eds were hit or miss, and you really need to use RateMyProfessor to make sure you know what instructor you\u2019re going to get. However, the good professors I had were amazing and far outnumbered the bad ones. Pretty sure this can be said for most universities though. \n\nThe one negative I continue to hear over and over is the on-campus housing. Some buildings are okay, others are terrible, but the general consensus is that none of them are \u201cgreat.\u201d I spent freshman year on campus and then moved sophomore year to a small place about five minutes away. It\u2019s just overall cheaper (if you don\u2019t have a scholarship that covers housing) and you aren\u2019t required to have a meal plan. \n\nTL;DR Loved ETSU, lots of great student life opportunities, the city is pretty cool. Classes are fine, just use RateMyProf to make sure you avoid the crackpots. Housing is is a big \u201cmeh\u201d and generally overpriced, so consider moving off campus. \n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": " I just graduated the nursing program. Don\u2019t study nursing at ETSU. A majority of the people I talked to in my graduating class feel the same- had we all known how unorganized the nursing program is we never would have applied to the program here. Go elsewhere. The professors are 70% horrible in the program. We\u2019d have lines waiting after every test to fight for points back. And every test we\u2019d get back 5-10 points because of the professor\u2019s errors. They\u2019ve actually had to replace one or two due to our complaints. Clinicals are abysmal. I never got to step foot in an OR or ER. Or really and subspecialty for that matter. I got 2 days in the ICU. Of course some students do, but it isn\u2019t more than a day or so. The rest of the time you will be on the same exact floors on a step down unit caring for more or less the same cases (heart stents, pacers, telemetry, etc). Of course you\u2019ll get a few weeks in mental health, labor and delivery (less than half of my group got to see a delivery), and peds (we spent 10 hours a day alone in a back room because there were 0 peds patients). The scheduling is unorganized and scattered. None of us would know our clinical placements until maybe two weeks until the semester would begin, leaving no room to let work know ahead of time. During my senior practicum, I wasn\u2019t even able to begin until mid February (semester started in January) due to the coordinators being unable to find me a preceptor. Everyone I talked to only got one or two chances in the hospital to place an IV during the entire two years of the program. I\u2019m lucky I worked in healthcare for years prior and during the program or else I would feel entirely unprepared. If you have any questions PM me. Oh and you probably don\u2019t know this but Ballad Health is a monopoly and bought out the entire tri-cities so every hospital and a good portion of clinics are run by them. So if you graduate and want to stick around, you have one option unless you want to dive 1+ hours. And trust me, Ballad SUCKS. They actually have a tier (level?) system in place for their employees where they need to do certain things in order to get to the next tier and receive a pay raise. One of these requirements is donating blood. Yeah. Your blood for a raise. Anyway, I fucking hate this town. Maybe I\u2019m biased. PM me for any questions.",

You will have good and bad professors no matter where you go, college will give you what you put into it. Pick somewhere affordable and somewhere you think you will be happy is my advice, no one really cares where you got your bachelor's degree from anyway as long as it's accredited.",

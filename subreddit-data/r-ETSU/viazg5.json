I'm kind of nervous and I'm very\nshy because I'm use to having my own bathroom\nbut now I have to share a bathroom with 100+\nother people and I don't know how that even\nworks. Like do we walk down the hall in our towel\nor do we remain fully clothed until we get there. I\njust have a lot of concerns and a lot of questions.\nI do hope to meet good friends especially since\nI'm going to be there for four years hoping.",

            "comment": "I stayed in Lucille Clement my first year on campus. It's honestly kind of a shitty building (very old, the doors had to be held a certain way to unlock them) but I hear it's been partially renovated since I left. I enjoyed my time there, it was convenient for walking to places.\n\nThere's a few big public restrooms on each floor, and there are several showers in each one. Every shower has a private space with a bench away from the waterflow once you step in where you can get undressed and set your stuff.",

I just played music on my phone and everyone minds their business in there. \n\nFifth Floor was the Kappa Delta\u2019s sorority floor when I lived there in 2013. Met a nice lady friend or 2 there going up and down the elevators. I was on the 3rd or 2nd floor, can\u2019t remember. But lots of good times there, Wi-Fi was good then but my cell service sucked. Had T-Mobile at the time and had to switch to Verizon..don\u2019t know if it was the building or what.\n\nBut try and get a job at the CPA\u2026 weightroom, intramurals whatever. It\u2019s right next door. Great way to make yourself meet new people.\n\nNothings super far on campus but Lucy (what we called the dorm then) is one of the furthest dorms from any class buildings. I had a crappy bike I kept out front but mainly walked.\n\nI enjoyed my time and Lucy and met 5 good friends and many other buddies there. I grew up in Kingsport so I already knew a lot of people going there but met some lifetime friends the first move in day.\n\nIt\u2019s a great place but get out and do stuff, make the most of your time on campus. The next 3 years I lived at Evergreen Terrace.. wonder how it\u2019s doing now\u2026",

The curtain also doesn\u2019t completely 100% cover you so if that\u2019s a problem for you just take two towels and hang it over the curtain rod on each side.",

Communal bathrooms take some getting used to, but the janitors do a great job. Clement's nickname on campus is \"Lucy.\" I've lived there since the fall of my freshman year in 2019 and have not had many complaints. It's the true classic dorm experience.",

Considering attending the program, but want to know what the professional bluegrass scene is like outside the school. Are there many opportunities for players to gig? Do many bars and restaurants hire bluegrass acts besides the Down Home? Any thoughts on the BG scene in Johnson City and surrounding areas would be welcome. Thanks.",

            "comment": "I know there are a few jams around the area, I have never been though. Lots of jams happen in Sam Wilson (Bluegrass hall) and some of the students throw private jams, if you're in the clique.  Most of the bluegrass action is on campus, or for a school events, so expect to play at things like conferences, farmers markets, ect. If you plan on majoring in bluegrass, you will probably be in 2-3 bands and 2-3 lessons a semester and that can get pretty intense, if you minor it'll probably be 1 band and 1 lesson a semester. But still, a each band is 1 credit, you meet 3 times a week for 2 hours, so don't let the credit fool you, it is a lot of work. (at least this was my experience, but I am in the old program, BLU, OLD, and COUNTRY music, not the new roots music program). But the program is pretty fun. A lot of people have had a few bad experiences with the program at least once, but if you're really into bluegrass it can be really fulfilling, and if you're new to bluegrass it can help you get acquittanced. You get classes off for IBMA and SPGMA, and I've been successful in getting excuses for other festivals. I am unsure about bars and restaurants I just haven't tried that hard, from what I hear they do, but it is EXTREMELY competitive, and etsu attracts the best musicians from around the world, so you may or may not have any luck with that. There is also the Boone creeks OPRY that you can play at. If you get a good band together while at ETSU though, it might be possible to get some of the local festivals to hire you. There are a variety of others things. Honestly if you're interesting in the program the best thing would be to come down and take a tour and see if it is for you.",

I\u2019m planning to visit and get in touch with the department on Tuesday.\n\nSorry to bother you with another question\u2026 concerning on-campus cliques, in your experience how open are these cliques to new people? Generally how friendly is the social scene? \n\nThanks again, your answer was great.",

A guy was stabbed last week because he broke a string during one of these duels. Needless to say, if you think you're the best you might be humbled really quickly. But I've already said too much.",

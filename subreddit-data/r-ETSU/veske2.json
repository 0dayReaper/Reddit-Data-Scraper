The academic departments are much easier with scheduling than other positions on campus and working in your own department allows the bonus of networking with/getting to know the professors you will be having for the majority of classes (and those who will be writing your letters of recommendation, etc. in the future).",

Think of it as a good opportunity to feel out your potential major and the people in it while getting to know how the department operates and such. Best of luck to you!",

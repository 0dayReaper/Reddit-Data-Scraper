But as for average TEAS scores for those applying to the program: 73.2% in reading, 79.5% in math, 58.5 % science and 66.9% in english. Composite score of 68.8%. That\u2019s the most recent info I got from my TEAS. The minimum to apply is 58% composite score",

I've heard they actually hold a sort of competition akin to the 1989 hit TV show American Gladiators where the dean and assorted professors battle applicants to see who will be admitted. The most impressive part of it all is the amount of hairspray some of the staff use, it's really becoming quite the spectacle! I've even heard the Johnson City arena is haunted. Not sure how true that is though.",

In order to take that, you have to have taken graphic design theory, and for that class you have to take core 1 &amp; 2 (foundations courses for design).  There's also drawing and intermediate drawing, and different levels of painting. \n\nAs far as a double studio art major goes, I guess it depends on if you plan to go the BA or BFA route as they are a little different.  I have heard of a few students doing that, like graphic design and printmaking. \n\nA lot of classes have a few prerequisites, and if you double major they should count for both I think. If you do come down here, make sure you meet with an advisor and get a plan going so you don't fall behind due to prereqs! And also don't forget about gen ed requirements as well.  ",

Hmmmmm.  I was looking at MTSU for the same reason, but it looks like they have the same situation...  Very little illustration focus even though they have at least 3 courses listed.",

The only other class of illustration that I knew about was the comic one but that professor left/retired and I have been told they wont offer it, and I can't find it in the current schedule. \n\nI'm sorry its not what you want though!! I also wish there were more illustration classes",

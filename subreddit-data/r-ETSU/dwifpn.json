    "postText": "\nEdit:  Passed my second attempt. If anyone would like any pointers on what to brush up on and expect please feel free to PM me. \n\nHey all, does anyone have any experience or advice for the SBE?\n\nI took it today for the first attempt, and as I kind of expected, I failed. I've been in school part time for the past seven years now so a lot of the information on it isn't necessarily fresh in my mind. A lot of it was accounting, which I took 5 years ago at Northeast, and a lot of Economics which I took 4 years ago. My advisor had told me previously that there isn't a \"study guide\" or \"prep material\", its either you know it or you don't, which made preparing for it impossible, thus the reason I expected to fail the first attempt. What makes it even worse though is the lack of information after failing it - they don't provide you your actual score or inform you about what sections (Accounting, Economics, Marketing, etc) you lacked in, so I don't even know what I missed to go back and refresh some of the fundamentals from different topics. \n\nSo yeah, just a little lost here about how to tackle it - I will go take it again tomorrow and perhaps use my scratch paper to take notes and simply plan to take it a third time. \n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",

I've made the Dean's List multiple times, and have worked my BUTT off the past few years.\n\nThis is an absolute disgrace. Not just losing accreditation, but sitting on it and not telling students for three months. I've never, NEVER been more disappointed in ETSU.",

If I put myself in their shoes, and consider being told my desired program had lost accreditation after getting in and making arrangements, what would I be able to do? What would I do? I wouldn't switch majors (because why settle?).  I'd be stuck in an unaccredited program. Had I been told in May, like SHOULD have happened with these students, I *might* could do something about it. I just don't understand not telling the students.\n\nAnd Anderson's excuse for losing accreditation? \"[the accreditation team/board] didn't want to set a precedent.\" WTF? What does that even *mean*?\n\nEDIT: I didn't even touch on the current students. What the hell are they supposed to do?",

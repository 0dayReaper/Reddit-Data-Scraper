I would double check with the Dental Hygiene Department for additional info. \n\nAny specific questions, I would recommend directing to the Honors College. My advice would be if you have the GPA and ACTs to be eligible, apply for it all if you\u2019re interested. They\u2019re all great programs and will help you grow as well as expose you to stuff outside of your intended major. \n\nNot sure exactly what you\u2019re looking for, but most academic areas will also have student organizations such as honors societies, Greek organizations, student leadership, volunteering etc. You won\u2019t really see this stuff until you are on campus though.",

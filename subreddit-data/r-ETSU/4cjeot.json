I'd like my minor to be legal studies. \n\nI am planning my classes (dont worry I will see and advisor, just doing some crude outlook on when I could theoretically graduate) and I have everything plotted out other than the 9-19 electives. \n\nI've already fulfilled my political science electives, what could this mean? Are these just any class I want to take? ",

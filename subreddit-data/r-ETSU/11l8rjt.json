Thank you for that btw\n\nI\u2019m alright with looking around both the campus and JC. It\u2019d be nice to find good places to go to as a group or pass time alone indoors or outdoors. I prefer night life but day time activities are good too. If you know anywhere good for cooking, that\u2019d be welcome too\n\nThanks you!",

Asheville and Knox have the only real night life IMO but JC usually keeps the doors open on at least 1 dance/bar (not sure what the current club name is today), but they do pop dance mostly. Mouses Ear (strippers) closed years ago but Knoxville has a great swingers club. Stay away from the meth and crank heads that fill up Sullivan County police cars. What's seriously unfortunate, is they are usually the people driving and not in the back seat. I've never met such a dishonest group of LE in my life (and I've lived in several states in my 60 years) .  If you drive a beater, you will get pulled over for made up offenses and if you refute those charges, expect the offense to be exaggerated into an arrest.  \nThe Dr. - corrupting the corrupt",

            "comment": "Dude do I ever have the place for you!\n\nI stumbled upon a hidden secret place known to only a few lucky souls. It had all the tropes of a classic college party destination - pulsating music, neon lights, dancing bodies, flowing alcohol, and a carefree atmosphere.\n\nI heard whispers and rumors about the place, but it was always shrouded in mystery. Some said that it was a doorway to another dimension, where the party never ended. Others claimed that it was a secret underground club run by a group of renegade students who had rebelled against the rigid rules of the college party scene.\n\nI didn't know how to get there, but I was determined to find it. One night, I heard the distant sound of music and followed it, weaving through alleyways and deserted streets until I found myself in front of an unmarked door.\n\nI hesitated for a moment, wondering if this was the right place. But the sound of laughter and music coming from within was too enticing to resist. I pushed open the door and stepped inside.\n\nThe place was everything I had imagined and more. The air was thick with the smell of smoke and alcohol. The walls were covered in graffiti and neon lights. The music was loud enough to make my ears ring.\n\nI danced and drank and laughed, forgetting about the world outside. I lost track of time and space. I was in a world of my own, a world where nothing else mattered.\n\nWhen I finally stumbled out into the daylight, I was disoriented and exhausted. I looked around, trying to figure out where I was. But the secret place was gone, vanished into the shadows once again.\n\nI searched for it, but it was as if it had never existed. I asked around, but no one knew what I was talking about. The secret place was a mystery, a legend, a dream.\n\nAnd so, I went back to my normal life, but I could never forget the magic of that one night. I knew that somewhere out there, the secret place was waiting for me, ready to whisk me away to another world, another time. But I could never find it again.\n\nMaybe it was the bath salts though.. those things are wild.",

            "comment": "Late response but, for on campus shit check out the ETSU [event calendar](https://go.activecalendar.com/etsu/directory). Some cool stuff on there if you keep an open mind\n\nFor night life, gonna depend on whether youre 21 or not but you have options regardless. If youre gonna be a student, downtown is pretty great. Heres some notable stuff\n\n1) the Hideaway - 18+ bar/music venue -  My personal fav place. music skews punk and punk adjacent but a lot of alternative acts too. Rlly good open mic here if thats your thing. Really chill crowds always. Owner is a local legend.\n\n2) Capones - 18+ bar/music venue - prob the most popular college spot. Local music of all genres. Occasionally get bigger names. Long line to get in on weekends sometimes tho. Basement is a dance club but its pretty sketch.\n\n3)Mulligans - All ages Irish gaming pub/restaurant/music venue - newish addition to downtown. They have board games and shit and a lot of open space. Can bring your own games. Live music sometimes but I tend to avoid those nights cause i never been a fan of what ive heard. Foods good but expensive. Pretty cool place\n\n4) holy taco - 18+ Mexican restaurant/bar - prob most famous food place downtown. Inexpensive and awesome. They do trivia on Thursday nights which is always popping and fun. \n\n5) Wild Wing Cafe - 18+ bar/restaurant/music venue - giant wing place. Its like buffalo wild wings but less bad. Music seems to trend southern rock/blues. Not a huge fan bc it can take FOREVER to get served as its huge and the place gets p packed.\n\n5) Tipton St. pub - 21+ irish pub - a true dive bar. Super popular. Food is surprisingly good but place is a lil trashy.\n\n6) Numans - 21+ bar - the local shithole. Two story unapologetic trash heap. Im ripping on it but it has its charms. Good place to play pool, throw darts, and sing karaoke, especially if youre bad at karaoke bc 9/10 times everyone else is much worse.\n\n7)Voodoo chicken/Rum bar - 18+ chicken place/bar/music venue - good food but way overpriced. Has my favorite bar trivia every Wednesday. The bar is hybrid indoor outdoor so its great in spring/summer. Music is hit or miss\n\n8)Windsor Speakeasy - 21+ secret(ish) bar. Its a speakeasy. Full bar hidden behind a vending machine. Its fine but super expensive.\n\nEverything above is within like a 2-5 min walk of everything else downtown and all are a 2-3 min uber ride from campus.",

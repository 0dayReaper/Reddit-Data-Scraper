Furthermore, the teal and red routes close at 4pm, and earlier on Fridays.",

This is an exciting time for our university; however, as with any construction, adjustments will be required.  We appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work to make this as seamless a process as possible.  In order to keep the entire ETSU community as well as campus visitors updated on campus construction, including parking and traffic changes, we are setting up a new informational website which can be accessed at http://www.etsu.edu/fa/fs/parking.   \n    \n    Lot 18 has now been closed for construction activity. Some spaces in lot 19 have also been closed.  However, over 250 spaces are still available in lot 19 and will remain open until Phase II begins in March 2016.  Nancy Dishner Lane, which runs between the CPA and current parking lot 19, is now a two-way street and is no longer available for parking.   Maps reflecting the changes can be accessed by clicking here.  During all phases of construction, ample spaces for student parking will remain available in lots 16, 21, and 22, which are all in the same general area.\n    \n    Please continue to monitor the website for updated information on parking and traffic changes throughout the construction process.  Go Bucs!",

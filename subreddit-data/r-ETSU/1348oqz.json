However, it was off campus at an apartment complex regarding their car being broken into.\n\nThere were a couple of incidents of drive by muggings when I was there and campus/city police took the incidents very seriously and an email was sent out college wide regarding the incidents.\n\nAssuming you\u2019re living in the dorms and locking your doors etc. it\u2019s highly unlikely that someone is going to purposefully break in to steal your 3080.",

These include, but are not limited to:\n\nRudeness towards other Redditors,\n\nSpreading incorrect information,\n\nSarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.\n\n**Am I banned from the Reddit?**\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\n**I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?**\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n**How can I prevent this from happening in the future?**\n\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

But, officially, I don't think they have storage to remove items from rooms.  When I lived in the dorms, our floor seemed to always have an unused accessible room where we were allowed to stash extra furniture and fixtures (hardline phones lol) as long as the room wasn't needed.  We just had to make sure our room had the right stuff back in it when we checked out at the end of the year.",

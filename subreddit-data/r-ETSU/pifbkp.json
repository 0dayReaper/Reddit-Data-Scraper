After Brian T. Smith did his enterprise on ETSU athletics, Mullins refused to speak with him, too.\n\nIt should be mentioned these actions did nothing to ease criticism of Mullins- it was still there. It only served to reduce the amount of coverage ETSU athletics received, either from myself or the Bristol Herald-Courier, who for years didn't have an ETSU writer after Mullins quit talking to Smith, who left the BHC for greener pastures afterwards.\n\nIn doing so, and for the rest of the local media to not call ETSU out on this, it set a disturbing sentiment in local media that they were there to be \"yes men,\" glorified public relations men instead of journalists.\n\nI never stopped being the latter.",

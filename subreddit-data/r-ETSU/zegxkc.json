    "postText": "A guy on campus was going by the name of Ryan Jones. He was on yik yak trying to find women to hook up with.  He would sometimes post looking for \u201csex slaves\u201d or \u201csubmissive women\u201d. He would also use Snapchat.  He tried to intimidate some women who grew concerned with his behavior. If you have any information or have had scary interactions with him, please comment on here or private message me.  \n\nAll of this info was shared on his Snapchat story before he regained access to it.   This isn\u2019t a smear campaign. We are trying to protect women from this man. If it was a smear campaign I would post his actual name.  Right now I am hoping to collect information to keep other women and his wife and kids safe from this violent man.",

Getting swole in Brooks Gym. Football and basketball games; football made the playoffs in 19 and 96 and beat Villanova at home. Me and my friend almost made the road trip the next week to snowy-ass Montana but chickened out. Being the first residents of Buc Ridge Apartments. Working with Dr. Harry Powell in Physics and opening up the Observatory named after him.  \nI'm pretty buc'ed up! Looking forward to seeing my first home game in Johnson City for Homecoming, too.",

Also, watching the Bucs play Florida in the NCAA tournament a couple years back with some friends at a wing place. I\u2019m excited for the game and pulling for the upset. Go Bucs!",

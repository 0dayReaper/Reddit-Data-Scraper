    "postText": "I'll be working around Johnson City this summer and the company I'm working for has a housing agreement with ETSU, so I'll be living there.  A few questions:\n\n1. Which building/area do they normally house non-ETSU interns at?  Or do they kind of get housed everywhere?\n2. Is there a place to practice an instrument, ie, either access to a music building/practice rooms, etc?\n3. Is it easy to get access to the ETSU music archives?\n\nThanks for any help!",

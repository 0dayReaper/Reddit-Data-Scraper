    "postText": "Hello everyone. I am a sophomore and am switching out of Sport Management. I am pretty sick of the content the classes entail and am finding I do not enjoy the field of marketing and sport business. \n\nI really love history and politics, specifically 20th century history. I consider myself an activist, and I am a leftist. While I think I would be fine studying either history or political science, I am looking for some advice (preferably from people in these classes), on what would be the better option for me. \n\nAs for jobs, I'd be content being a history teacher, but I also really enjoy writing, especially on political events. (I run a podcast on politics as well.) That splits me between journalism and secondary education. Museum curator or historian are also two other jobs that interest me. I would like to eventually go back and get my master's and maybe even my doctorates degree, if I can afford it in the future. \n\nSo that's where I am at. I have read online that many people double major in political science and history. I've also heard that these degrees pair well with journalism, and obviously secondary education. \n\nMy options, I assume, are as follows (unless anyone else has any ideas): \n\n* History with minor in Secondary Education\n* History with minor in Journalism\n* Political Science with minor in Secondary Education\n* Political Science with minor in Journalism\n* History and Political Science double major\n* History and Political Science double major paired with one of the minors (if even possible)\n\nWhat do you all think? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks so much!",

If you feel you're up to the challenge and you want to cover as much of your field of interest as possible, I'd suggest a double major in History and Poli Sci with a minor in Secondary Ed. If you'd like, feel free to shoot an email to Dr. Doug Burgess ([burgessw@etsu.edu](mailto:burgessw@etsu.edu)); Dr. Burgess is both chair of the department and the primary advisor for the major. He'd be more than happy to set up a Zoom meeting with you to discuss your options.",

As a Sophomore, I imagine you'll have most of your Gen Ed out of the way after this semester. It would be possible to finish in another four semesters, if you're willing and able to do heavier course loads. Four semesters at 18 hours each would leave you with only needing one more class. You could either do an overload one semester and take 21 hours or a Summer course (or more than one, if you want to lighten the 18 hour load) either this summer or next to keep from having to do the overload.",

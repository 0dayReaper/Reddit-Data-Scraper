    "postText": "Hey there. I\u2019m a junior in high school (homeschooled) and I\u2019m trying to decide if ETSU is the right fit for me. \n\nI want to major in journalism and I don\u2019t plan to live on-campus since I live in the area. (I\u2019ve also never really heard of ETSU\u2019s journalism program, so I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re very good; I\u2019m still looking into it.) I\u2019m used to online school and not being around other students, so I don\u2019t really care for being around others.\n\nMy ACT score is 21, but I\u2019m re-taking it in April so hopefully I get a higher score.\n\nDoes anybody have any idea on if ETSU would be a good school for me based on these things?",

I went to NESCC and got my Associates, but when I transferred to ETSU some of my core classes didn't transfer so I ended up having to retake those at ETSU. One class I distinctly remember not transferring is Physics.\n\nEssentially, do your due diligence and you'll save yourself a lot of money.",

The classes were taught almost identically, were interchangeable for most programs, but only one transferred. The distinguishment was about as clear as mud.  \n  The good news is that NESCC has since rebranded the courses as \"Survey of Physics\" and the other as \"Non-Calc Based Physics I\" which will hopefully help prevent confusion moving forward.",

Try to spend as little as possible, get that ACT score up and look for scholarships. Consider the free community college offers. You should be able to take a lot of your core classes online if that's your preference.",

Both have shuttle/bus service to campus, I believe, but double check to be sure. Parking on campus is a nightmare for students, esp since they've closed some lots to build the fb stadium. ",

I lived there my first year and I know many people who have lived there for their entire time at ETSU. Super close and have the free shuttle service. There are some sketchy people though and they're pretty cheaply built. Also ran by students. Monarch is just a stupid choice. Over priced and I've never heard a single positive thing about it, owned by the school. University Edge is owned by the same company and Heights at 1301. All three have the free shuttle. So if you want to be on campus I would personally get a dorm set up with different bedrooms and shared bathrooms and whatnot. Once you meet people to live with get a house or apartment off campus. The little bit of drive is worth it. Plus you'll save money. ",

            "comment": "Live on campus for the first year. Meet some people. Get a feel for things. Do not move into Monarch or University Edge. Evergreen is ok. An unaffiliated apartment center or (better yet) random house for rent will be better eventually. Check the tree streets and on Craigslist. Johnson City is not a big city and ETSU is not a big campus: wherever you end up you won't be far from campus, and the parking situation is fine as long as you're physically capable of walking 7-10 minutes max.

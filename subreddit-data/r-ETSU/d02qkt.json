It\u2019s so hard taking notes in this class and the objectives are unclear. Anyone else in a similar situation? I don\u2019t think I can deal with this the whole semester.",

Typically your Gen Ed history is memorize, regurgitate, forget. \n\nMy best advice is to just grab the slide deck if they're posted and try to do some self study. If not, maybe reach out to the GA or professor for the slide deck.",

Their classes do fill up fast, but during the drop/ add period, keep checking and ask the professor for a permit to add even if the class is full. They can do that!",

            "comment": "I tested out of the class when I went to school there and also taught the class later when I went back for my Masters in CS.  That was 2009, but the core of the course and exam likely hasn't changed a ton.\n\nThe overview is here:  https://www.etsu.edu/cbat/computing/uit/\n\nBut, it's basic computer fundamentals and the major applications in the office suite, Word, Excel, and used to include PowerPoint, but I don't see that on the page anymore.\n\nTheir requirements description is also here:  https://www.etsu.edu/cbat/computing/uit/uit_proficiency_requirement.php\n\n\"The exam requires a modern Internet browser.  It has three sections: a multiple choice section that covers Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 365; a Microsoft Word practicum; and an Excel practicum. \n\nThe exam is pass/fail (P/F).  To pass, students must score of 70 or above for each of these three sections. Scoring below a 70 in any section will result in a failure of the entire proficiency exam.\n\nPassing the exam provides no credit hours on a student's transcript -- but does fulfill ETSU's UIT proficiency requirement.\"",

            "comment": "To add more detail for the practicum portions:\n\nIn the past this was done using an assessment application that had a mock user interface that replicated the applications being tested, like Word.\n\nYou would have a question like \"Change the word 'Treasure' in the first paragraph to be bold and underlined\"  and you would then have to perform that action.  It's best to know how to use the \"Ribbon\" or toolbars to perform the tasks, because sometimes keyboard shortcuts aren't always measured accurately.  Also know how to use the \"References\" features of Word, page layout, and all the formatting options (not just text, but paragraphs, lists, etc.)\n\nFor Excel, make sure you know how to use functions to calculate data on ranges and how to use the most common functions like Sum, Average, etc.  If you know Excel well enough to do things like conditional formatting or lookups, you're probably already set.\n\nHere's the official study guide:  https://www.etsu.edu/cbat/computing/documents/study_guide.pdf",

We all do that and it is purposeful. Same thing for almost all the \"mistakes\" we do in class too.",

Hmmm... that didn't quite work. Arrhhgg!!! Excel! why do you make me look bad!?!? Let's see, does anybody know what happened? Let's Google it to find out...\"",

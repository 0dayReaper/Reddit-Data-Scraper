Lots of parties, garbage left around, and parking lot drama. The units themselves have been lived in pretty hard in some cases and things break a lot. \n\nPrecautions I guess would be to be aware of your surroundings, try to meet your neighbors and establish some mutual respect, and try to clean up after yourself. Document fully the condition of the apartment when you move in, get the number for maintenance, and keep some basic tools and duct tape around. \n\nAlso don\u2019t do drugs. You\u2019ll be alright.",

In terms of housing, absolutely do NOT live at Monarch.. I would avoid Student Quarters and Uni Edge as well. Universal Development and Construction is a great local company and has townhome rentals all over the area. I lived in a one-bedroom and it was perfect for what I needed during school.",

I concentrated in biostats and it's honestly not as useful as an MS in biostats, unless you want to be an epidemiologist for a health dept./CDC.",

Don't live at Monarch.\n\nI ended up living in an apartment/home in gray TN called Suncrest Village. Which is about a 15 minute drive to campus.  It was a good layout, management/maintenance was awesome. (this was also now 4 years ago.)",

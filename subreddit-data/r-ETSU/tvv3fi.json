            "comment": "Governors Hall is just one small room with a bathroom and the only dorm on campus that doesn\u2019t have a kitchen in the building. Everyone I know that lived there hated it for various reasons.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for apartment style then Centennial Hall\u2019s 2-bedroom is the best one, but it\u2019s also one of the most expensive. You\u2019d have your own room and you\u2019d share a tiny living room with a kitchenette and a bathroom with a roommate. Centennial also has efficiency apartments that\u2019s basically a studio with a kitchenette and bathroom (but I doubt you\u2019d get one as a freshman cause there\u2019s not many). \n\nBuc Ridge is an actual campus apartment/dorm right next to campus but it may be hard to get into as a freshman cause there\u2019s normally a long waiting list. It\u2019s also very pricey.\n\nDavis Hall has a kitchenette and bathroom too but you\u2019d share a room with someone, so it\u2019s a little cheaper.\n\nI believe all other dorms (except governors) has a communal kitchen. And a couple others have private bathrooms. I know Lucile and West has communal bathrooms... there\u2019s a dorm (I think Stone Hall) that has a bathroom shared by 4 people and communal kitchens. \n\nLiving on campus is fun freshman year but I recommend looking for off campus housing after your first year if you can cause it\u2019s honestly cheaper most of the time.",

The apartment I\u2019ve been in before had two bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room, and a full kitchen. When I was an upperclassmen I tried to get a room and they put me in a lottery for a room where they assigned everyone on the waiting list a random number and then went down the list 1-whatever and offered available rooms. I got something like 122 and they ran out of rooms before they made it to me. I don\u2019t think honors gets any special privileges, it\u2019s first come first serve.",

My last year of living on campus I had an efficiency apartment in centennial which is a private room that\u2019s basically a studio. A bedroom with a kitchenette and then a private bathroom. There\u2019s only probably 15ish and they are hard to get, especially as a freshman (also veryyy expensive). As far as off campus housing I recommend Evergreen Terrace. I lived there for a year and had no problems, they have security, and it\u2019s walking distance from campus. They have some one bedrooms but they fill up fast. Honestly though a one year lease at a two bedroom apartment at evergreen was about the same cost as living in the efficiency apartment on campus for two semesters (including the meal plan they require on-campus students to have that I never used), plus with a real apartment you have a place in the summer unlike living in dorms.",

You need a certain amount of credits in order to live in Buc ridge so that wouldn\u2019t be an option. If you were an honors student you could get an apartment in Carter hall which would be the cheapest option.",

So if you're interested, send us a message through mod mail and give us your pitch as to why you would be a great candidate for a mod position!   \n  \n\n#makeetsugreatagain  \n",

As someone who recently moved here from Asheville, it is sad to see how small Johnson City's reddit communities are. Anything that could boost activity around here would be appreciated.\n\nEDIT: if whoever prints these up wants to give me some or send me the file to print them off I can hang them up around the medical campus.",

If you are taking the mod job seriously you need to actually post things. Your last post to the sub was 9 months ago. Submit a text post and link it to Facebook to get your traffic up. You need to cross posts to other subs, people follow sports so do some cross posting to /r/cfb, /r/collegebasketball. \n\n\nYard signs that say /r/ETSU probably won't do you any good because a lot of people won't know what you are talking about. Make a banner or sign and take it to one of the games ",

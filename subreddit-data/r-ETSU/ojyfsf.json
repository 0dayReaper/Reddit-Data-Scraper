I've seen other threads on here that recommended staying away from the monarch, I was just curious as to why. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

The units get lived in pretty hard, so facilities are problematic. There will always be noise at night. Stuff left in vehicles in the parking lot may disappear sometimes. \n\nTell your friend to be aware of surroundings, clean up after himself, and keep his vehicle secured. He\u2019ll survive.",

My car got hit and vandalized, I was harassed by other residents, AC was out for 2 months, management tried to screw me over multiple times, maintenance staff would enter my place without warning.. I'm not sure how it is nowadays, but I haven't heard that anything has changed.",

I know absolutely no one from this area since I'm from NY. I don't have much to do when I get home from work so I'm just looking to see if there is anything to do around here. Thanks.",

There are breweries in JC and, if you have a car, head over to Asheville for a day. If you're into biking, the Creeper Trail is great. Johnson City is rich in history, so check out the ghost lore and historical sites in the area. The AMC theater in JC is really nice if you're looking for indoor activities. There also used to be murder mystery shows in the area. There used to be a cheap little waterpark nearby too. If the Gray Fossil site is opened, it's definitely worth the drive.",

Ive always been more of an introvert so meeting new people, especially in an area unknown to me, is pretty difficult. I'm tryin my best to put myself out there so that i have thing to do while I stay in JC. I appreciate the information.",

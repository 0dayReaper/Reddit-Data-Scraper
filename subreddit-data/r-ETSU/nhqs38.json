            "comment": "For the 7-Day plans, there are three tiers: Silver, Gold, and Platinum. The two higher tiers are not at all worth it, in my opinion. The best way to use the meal plans are to take advantage of the Marketplace dining hall and use the dining dollars as a special treat on occasion. With the meal plan, each student is able to enter the dining hall four times per day: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Late Night. The offerings in the dining hall are, under normal conditions, greatly varied and most of the food is decent to to very tasty. You and your daughters can view previous menus [at this link](https://menus.sodexomyway.com/BiteMenu/Menu?menuId=14750&amp;locationId=10481001&amp;whereami=https://etsu.sodexomyway.com/dining-near-me/resident-dining); there are some things - such as pizza/burgers/etc. - offered daily while other things rotate. There are also special themed days and events in the dining hall throughout the semester.\n\nAll students living on-campus (not including Buccaneer Ridge Apartments) are required to have a meal plan. For the cost difference between the 7-Day Silver and 5-Day plans, I would suggest both of your daughters going with the 7-Day Silver plan. It is $245 more per semester, but even if the junior is only on campus roughly half of the weekends of the semester that works out to only $5.83/meal for her weekend meals.\n\nThis is all assuming they would take advantage of the dining hall, of course. There's plenty of value to be had in a meal plan, but those that often choose to eat elsewhere/order delivery/etc. are most definitely going to feel they're wasting money.",

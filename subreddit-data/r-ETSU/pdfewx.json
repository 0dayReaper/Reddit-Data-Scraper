I was rather stressed out during the needs assessment session because I\u2019d never done something like that before, but they were understanding and kind about it",

I do know you can go for four individual counseling sessions per semester at no charge and, after that, the charge is very minimal compared to what you would pay anywhere else. They have other resources available outside of individual counseling as well.",

If you are stressed or in need of fast counseling, it is perfect! A wonderful experience and they will help you move on if you need continuing therapy.",

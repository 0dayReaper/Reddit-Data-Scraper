You are technically an adult now. Drink like one. Pick a good mid level bottle of whiskey or vodka. Drink it neat, on rocks, or with soda. Keep count of how many you drink. Limit how many you drink per hour. Drink water in between orders. Use ride-sharing or a sober friend to get you around. Throughout the night, continually text someone that's not with you messages and pictures of your night  You will be glad to have it to look back on, plus it's a safety precaution. Buy some Pedialyte in advance and keep it in your fridge at home before you go out. Drink about a third of the bottle before bed if you get too drunk. \n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY! HAVE A GREAT TIME!!!",

It can't be that far back home, why waste money you could spend on booze on an Uber? Go crazy man the world is your oyster live a little!\n\nGo get fucked up at any of the fine establishments that serve booze like Newman's if you wanna smell cigarettes smoke to make you feel even more adult. Actually you should pick up smoking too.",

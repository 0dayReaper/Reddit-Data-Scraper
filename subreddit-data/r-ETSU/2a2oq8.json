I'm going to the office to learn more this fall, but I'd like to know from some people who have gone as students.\n\nHow was it? Was it easy getting the credits to transfer? Anything I should know? What were the costs like?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Do it! I'm in Japan right now and will be returning soon. I got the scholarship they recommend for one semester. Sorry, but I forgot what it is called. The got me $1,600. Excluding tuition I've spent probably $3,000. That includes rent and a lot of traveling around Tokyo. About transferring credits, all you need is to contact your university of choice and get class descriptions and then run them by the appropriate people at ETSU to see if they qualify. It's not a big deal. The only bad thing was the TONS of paperwork in preparation to study abroad. It's worth it! Since starting ETSU I knew I was going to study abroad and I'm finally living that dream. I'll be climbing Mount Fuji this month. Who could have guessed? Amazing. ",

                            "comment": "I'm not entirely sure what your asking, but I'll tell you more about what I did. I did the bilateral exchange program because it cost the least amount of money. It's where there are \"deals\" set up between ETSU and certain other universities around the world to promote exchange. You pay ETSU tuition for a student abroad and that student then pays tuition for you at their home university. This greatly reduces the cost. I'm still trying to find the scholarship I had received but can't. I could have used that scholarship for anything if that could answer your question above, though it went towards tuition in my case. Another interesting note is that because my friend wrote a longer essay for the application, he was awarded almost double. I'd like to say around $3,000, so take your time with it. Kelly Hill from from the international building could tell you all about it. I'm also using my hope scholarship as well which provides $2,000 personally. The $3,000 I mentioned before covered transportation (very expensive in Japan), a lot of visits to restaurants, groceries, rent, and gifts for myself and people back home. I also just thought of the plane ticket. At $1,400 round trip, its expensive but unavoidable with Japan being on the other side of the world. I would like to say thats also included in the $3,000 stated above. ",

I studied abroad in Germany for five months as a junior and it was so worth it. \n\nDo:\n-Apply for ALL the scholarships. Both ETSU scholarships and others that are offered by the program, the U.S. government, and the university abroad.\n-Be open to studying abroad somewhere English isn't the native tongue. I went to Germany knowing absolutely no German and got around just fine. Depends on the country as well, I suppose.\n-Start early. Start thinking about where you want to go as early as three semesters, and apply two semesters before you leave.\n-Talk to Kelly Hill in Yoakley Hall. She's is the person to talk to about everything study abroad.\n\nDon't:\n-Go there broke. Save up as much as possible so you can actually travel and do fun things. London is a little pricey, but a 3K fun budget should be pretty okay. \n-Let money stop you from going. If you only have the bare minimum, you'll still have a great time. Just be aware that you may not be able to leave the city you're in very often.\n-Stay in the American bubble. I know it's easy to gravitate towards people that are similar, especially if you're all housed together, but you're abroad! Try and mingle with other exchange students and locals if you can.\n\nGood luck! ",

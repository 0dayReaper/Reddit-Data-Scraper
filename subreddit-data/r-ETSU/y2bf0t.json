    "postText": "I\u2019m new here and looking for a good place (besides the campus) to do some flat ground skating that wouldn\u2019t have anyone around typically and where I wouldn\u2019t get ran off or into trouble. I don\u2019t mind if I have to drive a little bit (20-30) minutes to get there, it\u2019d just be nice to have a spot I can go where it\u2019s quiet to skate once in a while, especially in the evenings. \n\nAnyone know of anything? So far it seems impossible. Thanks in advance!",

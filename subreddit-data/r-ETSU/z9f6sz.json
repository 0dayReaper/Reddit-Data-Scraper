I'd love to find a copy someday. \n\nI have a few tracks I ripped from his Myspace, but there doesn't seem to be much left online anymore. \n\nIf anyone here happens to have any of those recordings, I'd love to hear them again.\n\n(I tried asking this in /r/tricities and they banned me for it. Not sure if the mod there has a connection to the rapper or what.)",

    "postText": "Dear ETSU Reddit, \n\nI am a recently accepted student into ETSU's Honors College program and I am curious what the differences between dormitories. \n\nI was only able to tour Governors Hall and was contempt with what is provided, but now with the choice of choosing between this and Honors housing, I feel a bit torn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I suppose I am asking is for those who have lived in Gov. Hall and students who have stayed in the Honors dorm. \n\nWhat are the things you have enjoyed and the things you've grown not very fond of?",

I lived there freshman year and some of my most fond memories in college are from that hall.\n\nAs for the honors housing in Carters hall, I\u2019ve only been in there a couple times. The building is much older but has been renovated I\u2019m pretty sure. It\u2019s much closer to most things on campus. Carter hall doesn\u2019t have a set room layout and I don\u2019t know exactly which style room the LLC for the honors program would have. Most LLC\u2019s are typically in the cheapest rooms however so you likely would have a communal bathroom as opposed to the private one in Govs.",

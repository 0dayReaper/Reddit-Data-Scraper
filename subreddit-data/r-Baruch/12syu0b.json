Login and make sure to take the classes you need because otherwise it may not be tap compliant.\n\nAlso, here is a bba pathway resource but keep in mind it may be off as you may have been ahead and taken some of the classes already or gotten credits transferred over. This is why I emphasize that you find that out by logging into degree works, which shows what classes you need to take. Also, it may be a little outdated, as generally people follow degree works.\n\nhttps://enrollmentmanagement.baruch.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2023/03/Accountancy-BBA.pdf\n\nIf you\u2019re still confused after try to set up an advising appointment through navigate, but warning most are not very good.\n\nGenerally, though, seems like your schedule is ok in terms of what you should take.",

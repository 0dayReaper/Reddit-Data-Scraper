Also the email mentions this, \u201cIf you have taken and passed a college level course that supersedes your mathematics placement, you may have your placement adjusted by the mathematics advisor present during the advisement sessions. Please bring your transcript and appropriate course description to the advisement sessions. You will receive information regarding orientation, advisement and registration under a separate cover.\u201d meaning exemption?",

The precalc will overwrite the placement if you get the credit for it. And I email the office and waiting for response.",

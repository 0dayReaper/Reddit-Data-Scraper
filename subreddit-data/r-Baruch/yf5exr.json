    "postText": "No, this isn\u2019t a post about applying to Baruch. It\u2019s for those already here.\n\nIt\u2019s about the library.\n\nIf you want to socialize, meet up with your friends and chit chat, play games, laugh, complain, or vent. Do it quietly, or do it literally anywhere else.\n\nIt\u2019s infuriating to students who are actually in the library seeking a quiet place to focus. It\u2019s not just the second floor. The students that can\u2019t find a table to talk go to the third floor. When that\u2019s too crowded they go to the fourth. It trickles up until the library loses its entire purpose.\n\nNew York is beautiful. Madison Square is a few blocks away. The courtyard between the buildings is lovely. There are so many other places you can consider before you decide to ruin everyone else\u2019s quiet study space.\n\nGo literally anywhere else.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am supposed to be graduating this semester. I am finishing all of my last classes.\n\nI have applied for graduation before the deadline in February, but for some reason, when I go to cunyfirst, they keep saying that my graduation status is under-review.\n\nIs this something to be concerned about?\n\nAlso, are we supposed to pay some graduation fee in order to graduate this semester other than caps and gowns and tickets?",

It should also tell you if you aren't because I had a classmate who got one that said she wasn't getting the degree and it will listed reasons why. \n\nI also checked on my CUNYfirst and my status said \"Status: Need to complete current coursework\r Expected Graduation Term: 2023 Spring Term\".\n\nI think if you got that email you should be fine, but if you really want to double check make an appointment with BOSS (Not sure if they're open right now b/c of Spring Break).",

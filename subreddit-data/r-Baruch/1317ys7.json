            "comment": "I understand it was really daunting feeling like I was still in high school during college because the social life is nonexistent outside of the friends I had from high school.\nUnfortunately graduating and looking to start a career, the rigor and the internship and networking opportunities a school can provide is very critical. Albany is not bad for accounting I know a lot of people who went there and now work for the Big 4 but the same can be said about people I went to Baruch with. \n\nAs obnoxious as it is, I had to just see Baruch as school and something I did. the big advantage is being in NYC and as cliche as it is, there\u2019s a lot to do with yourself and your time in this city that a place like Albany can\u2019t really provide. There is a college experience the SUNYs can provide but most of your life would revolve around that so there is the trade off. \nIt helped a lot to find hobbies or interests. A lot of the clubs aren\u2019t good but going a few times to meet people can be worthwhile. I had to work to support myself during my time at school but working in restaurants and bars I made a lot of friends so that is what gave me a social life and it\u2019s work experience. Also, hanging out with NYU, Pratt, and Parsons kids and just going to their parties made up for Baruch being lame. \nIt really sucks and there\u2019s pros and cons. I personally would just stay at Baruch and intern as much as possible to build up a resume, utilize your location in the world financial capital to your advantage, and also have something to do that\u2019s not just class and go home. \n\nBest of luck to you and no matter what decision you make it\u2019s just one part of your life. School is hard and mentally draining but you\u2019re doing it and that\u2019s a huge accomplishment",

Honestly, it\u2019s so easy LOL, you don\u2019t even need to write an essay to transfer you just need to send in your transcripts (high school and college) and submit an application through COMMON APP or SUNY APPLICATION. However, since you already plan on transferring, you might as well go straight to a SUNY. It doesn\u2019t make much sense to go to a CUNY knowing you will transfer out. Don\u2019t do my mistake. Well I didn\u2019t know I would be transferring but I regret not going to a SUNY in the first place because I would have received more money in scholarships entering as a first year. Also Baruch is a commuter school. I underestimated how difficult it would be to make friends. And if you\u2019re introverted like me, it\u2019ll just be even harder to find friends because most just go to class and go home. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m transferring to a SUNY. I want the the traditional college experience. I\u2019ll still be introverted but it\u2019ll be easier to make friends being on a campus where there\u2019s a  secluded community. There aren\u2019t much events at Baruch anyways but yeah, that\u2019s my advice. If I could go back in time I would have chosen to go to a SUNY school straight after high school. Hopefully I was able to help!",

    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nThroughout my past few months spent at Baruch, I've noticed a staggering amount of my peers, specifically those from Zicklin, being unable to place into competitive internships within the industry of their choice. In wanting to address that niche, I set out to create a simple guide for new and existing Baruch students that could lead them in the right direction and help overcome a few barriers blocking their way to professional success. \n\n[Recruiting from Baruch - An Informational Guide](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Ai_fi1b3CGQMd2vxl9xGg1dew0g)\n\nAs it is a longer piece, I've included a table of contents in the front-end of the deck for ease in navigation. Note that this does not necessarily include *everything.* Moreso, it is meant to serve as a primer and general layout for those in need. \n\nHopefully, this will especially be of use to you, your peers at school, as well as your parents (they want you to move out). Wishing you all the best in your individual endeavors!",

Unfortunately, I didn't want to link it in my guide due to worries of it getting taken down.",

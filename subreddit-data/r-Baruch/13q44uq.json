Quick question. \n\n As a graduate student graduating this semester (Spring 2023), if I still have an outstanding tuition balance from this semester that I might not be able to pay fully in the next couple of months, will I still receive my diploma and be awarded graduation, or is it necessary to pay the balance in full before being awarded graduation and receiving my diploma?",

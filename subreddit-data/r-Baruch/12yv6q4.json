    "postText": "Hey everyone. I\u2019m really trying to graduate in the summer and the final course that I have to take is MKT 3520 or 3600 or 3605. I don\u2019t currently meet the pre requisite (STA 2000) to take MKT 3600.The other two classes aren\u2019t offered in the summer. Is there any way I can bypass the pre req or do an E-permit to get credit for the courses. Please let me know if there are any options for me to get the credit this summer. Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "You can bypass the prereq by emailing the professor of the class you wish to register in. The prof will usually send you a Google form to fill out to ask for approval. If you explain it's for graduation you will likely be approved. \n\nKeep in mind with epermit, you need to take 60% of your core major classes at Baruch. There's a category in degreeworks that let's you know which classes fall under the 60% range. If you have already taken an epermit class for your major classes, then you will need to register for a course at Baruch to even out the 60% before you apply.\n\nJudging by all of this, you may also need a credit overload approval form. \n\nhttps://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/current-undergraduate-students/business-courses-enrollment-criteria/unit-overload/\n\nRemember there are only 2 classes per session in the summer. Total of 4 classes. If one of your classes is an 8W1 class, you will need to file this. If you will be taking more than 2 classes per session, you will need to file this before filing for an epermit.\n\nI believe I've covered a healthy amount of info here, I wish you the best of luck.",

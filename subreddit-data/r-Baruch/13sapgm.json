            "comment": "Our human mind is naturally wired to be social. But in today's time we have a problem. Social media inhibits the part of your brain that allows you to create networks in-person. Reason being is that your brain perceives that you have a network already (its online).\n\nBut you need to create a network in person to be successful at life. In order to build a network in person, naturally without any \"special tips\" (because there are none, really) take a break from your smart phone, or just leave it at home when you come to school.\n\nYour social anxiety will naturally begin to decrease and your mind will start wanting to be social again in person. This reset takes about 1-2 weeks away from your phone. I highly recommend it. Of course what you do at the end is ultimately on you, I wish you good luck. \ud83d\udc4d",

It takes one hello to start a conversation and if the conversation doesn\u2019t continue then you say ok well what did I do wrong and try to learn from it. You have to keep trying despite all your fear to improve and trust me you\u2019ll still dread it every time, but you it\u2019ll help you whether it a success or not. I believe in you, just sign up for events and start trying!",

There aren't many universal rules so you'll eventually figure out your style, and then apply that to other areas in life.\n\nWhy I think this works:\n\n- It gets you comfortable with approaching strangers, who may not initially care about you\n- You become goal-oriented instead of aimless\n- You need to use direct language to avoid wasting time\n- You learn how to handle rejection\n- You figure out your conversational style, which makes the interactions more genuine and you are more likely to attract new friends",

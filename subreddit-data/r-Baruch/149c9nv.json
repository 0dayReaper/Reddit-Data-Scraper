    "postText": "This is weird I know but I\u2019ve noticed that the Professors at Baruch use Pearson whereas at BC McGraw Hill was all I ever encountered. Anyone else notice this and/or know why? Do you agree?\n\nI don\u2019t like Pearson and will avoid a class that uses Pearson platform. \n\nI\u2019ve done tutoring for someone in a Baruch class that used Pearson and the format was horrible. If you chose to be shown an example then all the work you had done was erased and you were given a new problem set. Not clear how to submit a problem. \nThe MH setup is much simpler.",

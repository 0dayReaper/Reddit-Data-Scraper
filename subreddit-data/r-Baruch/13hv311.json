Like most other CUNY campuses (but not all yet), Baruch set up a separate Wifi channel listed as \"eduroam\" that any CUNY student can log into using their CUNY Login (the same credentials you use to log into Blackboard and CUNYfirst). The eduroam service works around hundreds of campuses across the world. If you're on a college campus somewhere and you see the \"eduroam\" channel as an option, you should be able to log into their wifi using your CUNY Login. Here's the map of institutions where you can find eduroam: https://monitor.eduroam.org/map\\_service\\_loc.php",

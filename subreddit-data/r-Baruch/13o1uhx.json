    "postText": "I\u2019ve recently in a interview for a HR internship, the HIRING manager really liked me and said I should meet up with the current intern. We met and intern told me a lot of the responsibilities and stuff, we clicked. Now the hiring manager wants me to meet the VP of operations , who is here boss in person at the office. \n\nMy worry is that, am I already kinda accepted or do I really have to finesse this in person final interview to be accepted? Because I haven\u2019t got any official offer yet. \n\nWhat if there\u2019s more candidates liek me who are also being interviewed? \n\nShe said first they\u2019ll show me the office, which one of my recruiter friend thinks really good sign. \n\nIdk y\u2019all, should I be worried that there might be more peoples who are also being interviewed for the final selection?",

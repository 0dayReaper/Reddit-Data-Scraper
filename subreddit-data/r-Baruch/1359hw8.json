You can try to take then together, but if you struggled with math in high school I recommend taking them separately. Eco 1001 in the fall and macro in the spring. Especially if you\u2019re planning on taking accounting. As ACC 2101 and 2203 are a lot of work.",

And would micro really be that hard in the summer cause the semester is basically over and i\u2019m just dropping it so i have a grasp of the curriculum. But like is that enough? or am i still gonna be f\u2019ed?",

Like a homework assignment for a week would be due every 3days, and they would only have time to teach you the concepts, so practicing the problems would be up to you. Since the connect assignments are not similar to the exams you are basically forced to do a lot at once. It's pretty difficult to grasp the material in such as short time. Also, they will test you on all the materials, so don't think they will cut down on the materials. At least, that was my experience last year.",

It's a hard course, and unless you know the material well or are willing to study and work all day every day for the duration of that semester, you will not do well. In my case, like 20 people dropped the class when they failed the midterm. I just stuck with it and got a B-, but my friend dropped and retook it over the spring and got an A. Also, Eco 1002 is so easy compared to Eco 1001, and you don't need to take them in order. You can take Eco 1002 first if you want. I'm hoping for your sake that you got good professors. I'm guessing you got Acc 2101, which is a lot of homework and information. Acc will take a lot of work, but it's simple if you have Harry Davis because his exams are the same as the homework. Never took QNT, so can't say anything about it. All in all, it's up to you and how ready you feel about the class.",

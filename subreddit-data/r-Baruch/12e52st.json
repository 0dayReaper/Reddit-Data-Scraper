    "postText": "Hello, I am currently at BMCC majoring in Financial Management. I want to ask about transfer to Baruch- Finance major\n\nIt has not been a good experience since I get in cuny . A lot of confusion and advisors that does everything but what they are supposed to do, that is advise. I get in to a point that the desinformaron about what and how my credits will transfers got me anxiety attacks. All the advisors that I consult did not anything about the process, they just read the web page of the college and that is all. \n\nPlease, somebody knows or have experience with transferring from BMCC to Baruch to get a major in finance.\n\nDid you have problem with the credits? Like having to take too much courses because the courses that you took did not count towards the degree in Baruch?",

            "comment": "Hmmm, transferring credits shouldn\u2019t be a problem if you\u2019ve take some finance related classes such as Econ, accounting, etc. For example, if you\u2019ve taken micro and macro economics at your cuny and passed the class, the courses should successfully transfer to baruch as ECO 1001 &amp; 1002. Even if you\u2019ve taken some basic Gen Ed classes such as Sociology, political science, etc, those courses transfer to any CUNY. The only case where transfer credits may get a bit confusing is if you\u2019re transferring math classes, there\u2019s many different variations of calculus courses at Baruch, not the typical calc 1,2,3 sequence that you might see at other schools. Transferring credits should be no problem from BMCC to baruch should be no problem OP, I think what you\u2019re more worried about is the transfer process itself?",

Like if exist a way that I know before getting a m Baruch, if some courses will not be counted towards the degree. For example, if I took a accounting class and maybe it is counted as a free elective. Something like that. So I want to k won if you have problems or needed to take more courses than planned. \n\nThx",

So I don\u2019t know much about the transfer process but transferring credits shouldn\u2019t be a problem at all. Maybe you could get in contact with one of the advisors at Baruch.",

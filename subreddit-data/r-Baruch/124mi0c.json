            "comment": "A lot of people recommend it if you wanna get it out of the way. A lot of juniors take those classes meaning they get filled up during enrollment for Fall/Spring. However Summer isn\u2019t as competitive to get classes, so it\u2019ll be easier. \n\nIn terms of class difficulty, take the one you feel most confident on/had experience with. Know a bunch of people who went into Physics because they already know bio/ecology and it hurt their gpa bad. It\u2019s definitely doable, but it\u2019s all about Professor at the end of the day.",

Both are generally taught in high-schools. Chem and Physics are known to be very difficult, that in combination with the amount of time you have to learn the material during the summer sounds like a recipe for disaster.\n\n(Lab+Lecture is 6 credits together so you\u2019ll be eligible for Fafsa aid as well unless you plan on taking extra courses).",

            "comment": "I transferred to Baruch and it was the best and the worst decision I ever made. Make sure you know what you\u2019re getting into. Classes are not only intense, you\u2019re on your own and the advisors are of little to no help. My graduation is late because degree work\u2019s updates are so delayed that I didn\u2019t even realize just how many more classes I need to take to graduate. They did not transfer all of my credits and I am forced to take freshmen year Gen Ed classes on top of 2 extra semesters. Also there is no real campus life or Greek life here. \n\nThat being said, I am in the business school and I haven\u2019t fallen in love with my major as deeply as I do until now, I have met brilliant minds here, and I have grown so much from who I first was when I walked in the doors of Vertical Campus.  \n\nI lived in the dorms my first year, it is quite competitive to get in but you should be fine if you apply in time. However, in my opinion the dorms are not worth the price, it is better to live in an apartment with a roommate on every level. I am curious, is this also your move to NYC? In that case, dorming might be a better option. \n\nBaruch can be a great opportunity if you know how to seize it. But no one will help you, only you can save yourself here.\n\nHope this helps.",

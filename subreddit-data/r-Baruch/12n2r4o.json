    "postText": "How many times can they do a transfer credit audit in CUNY? I plan on transferring to a different school in the fall, but would like my current semester classes recognized. However, York says they've already completed an evaluation and it will be reflected on CUNYFirst by Friday. This semester ends in may.\n\nCan I request another evaluation after the semester ends?",

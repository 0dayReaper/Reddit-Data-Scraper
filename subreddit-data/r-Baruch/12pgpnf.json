            "comment": "I have him on Sundays for CIS 2200. It's a 3 hour lecture, but we are always done in 2 hours maximum. \n\nHe doesn't take attendance. Homework and quizzes are due on Sundays but not every week. \n\nWe can take quizzes and exams (including the final) at home. \n\nI really like him as a professor, but I can't hear him well in the classroom. He's too quiet and laid back. He's always willing to answer all your questions, even the stupid ones. \n\nI also registered for 3400 summer session. I might drop it because of timing, but I wish to take more classes with him.",

But he teaches well.\n\nEdit: I have a feeling that he is still a PhD student or teaching at other colleges as well because his classes are always evenings or weekends.\n\nEdit 2: His name came in LGCC staff and faculty. He definitely teaches at more schools.",

The only few times he takes almost the whole class is sth important like midterm review, you don't want to miss that. For the exam you have the whole 3 hours to finish (and sure you can finish and leave early)",

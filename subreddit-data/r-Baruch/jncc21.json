Thankfully, my professors have uploaded all remaining assignments for the remainder of the semester. I've completed them all last night.\n\nAll I gotta do now is just 1 more research paper and I am done.  I was considering doing MA at CUNY, but fuck that. Not worth wasting time and money.",

I can totally see people taking a gap semester or a gap year.  If you have professors who are the type of teachers that are one of those \"read the textbook, post on blackboard\", why the hell are you even paying for those classes? You're not being taught anything. You're paying $1000 just to be told to read the damn book. Doesn't sound like a worthwhile investment, imo.",

Experience a different educational system, different perspectives and different ways of teaching. Most grad schools in Europe are extremely affordable, and most of their master's programs are 1 year.  I would advise against considering UK because of Brexit and how it's gonna mess everything up for everyone, foreign and EU/EEA students. On average, 1 year master's program in UK will cost a student around 20,000-25,000GBP. \n\nCheck out studyeu or mastersportal and browse through the programs. If you make a decision to apply, get in touch with some of the professors that you had in, in-person settings, remind them of who you are and ask whether they'd be willing to write a LOR. \n\nI'm currently in the process of collective all documents and I'm ready to apply to grad school in EU. All I need is a copy of my degree and official transcript and I can send out the applications for September 2021 cycle.",

Brexit is gonna have a devastating effect on young EU/EEA folks. Before Brexit, you had an opportunity for a scholarship, a grant, that will no longer be an option. Also, being completely realistic, a lot of European students from the former USSR and Yugoslavia simply will not be able to afford education and life in the UK.",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I'm a Finance major, an upper-sophomore and this is my first semester at Baruch (transfer for a CC). I am planning to learn programming languages (Python, C++) and start to code a little bit and would love to hear your opinions on how I can utilize that here at Baruch. I know that you can self-teach yourself using YT or other online tutorials, however I know that learn the most when I work together with other people. Thank you for any outputs!",

Taking such a course will at least give you the discipline to study the basics. From there you will likely have a much easier time understanding on-line tutorials and Youtube examples.\n\nNot sure if you have room in your schedule but you may wish to consider a [business minor](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/minors/optional-minors-for-business-majors/) in one of the CIS areas.   Again, just a bit more structure where you could take CIS 2300, CIS 3120 (also Python) and perhaps CIS 3100  (C++) or another CIS course that interests you.",

Take MTH 3150, 3300, and chose one more from this list: [https://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/ASheffer/csminor.html](https://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/ASheffer/csminor.html)\n\nNote: I've already taken 3300, 4300, and an equivalent class to 3150 and plan to do more. So far, I feel I've learned a lot, but I had some coding background already prior to taking these.",

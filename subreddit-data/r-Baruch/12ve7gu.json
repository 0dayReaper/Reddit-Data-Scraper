But I'd say go to club events related to marketing and definitely reach out to people on LinkedIn. Ik most of the time they don't reply to you but all you need is one yes to change your life.\n\n\nThere are plenty of free marketing certifications online that you can get and include in your resume. Google has plenty, Salesforce has some, Facebook, hubspot marketing has some too.\n\n\nHmmm idk about my next milestone. Happy with what I have and I plan to stay in this position for a while.",

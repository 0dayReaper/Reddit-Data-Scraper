When I took him last semester it was 7 Quiz and course is finished he entered grades in few days before grades were due too. I have a friend that also took his class 2 weeks ago that just ended and they said it was the same as I mentioned to them. It\u2019s a 1.5 credit 7 week class he can\u2019t change much to begin with imo. But like a comment below I can also provide some SS of proofs from what I got from his class last semester and get my friend to show her score that she got during this semester",

True/False questions. 7 Quiz = total grade for the whole class he drops the lowest score. I can show you SS of proof for how his class was but I\u2019m saying this as someone who took him last semester. This current semester I had a friend that also took him in the first session for spring, same exact format as he did for my class.",

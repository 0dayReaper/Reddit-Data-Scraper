    "postText": "The semester will be officially over in less 2 weeks but only my pell grant has been disbursed. The disbursement date on Cunyfirst said I'd be getting my refund on February 20th or something like that. I emailed bursar several times about it and when they finally responded they told me that the disbursement date on their end was April 17th. \n\nBut almost a full month has gone by since then and I have yet to receive my refund. I emailed them again on May 1st  and they told my TAP was reposted and was now anticipated on 4/21/23. Its already been 3 weeks and still nothing. My financial aid has been delayed in the past but never to this extent. Since financial aid exceeds the total cost for the semester I was never in danger of being dropped from a class or anything like that but its still annoying to be given 3 different dates that were all wrong",

I contacted Bursar and they said that they don't know why HESC told me that bc they already did everything they needed on their end l, and my disbursement was delayed because HESC made some last minute changes and my new anticipated disbursement date was April 20th. They also told me that bc the award as well as the anticipated date changed, it could take up to 2 months to get my award.\n\nSo who knows who's fault it is but I was told I'd probably get it by June so if I don't I'll try to contact HESC and Bursar again. I might contact HESC again before that since they and Bursar told me different things and are basically shifting blame as to why its taken so long.",

To understand how financial aid works, how it gets disbursed and whether or not you'll get a refund I made a detailed guide that will help you check your cunyfirst to see if you got a refund.\n\nIf your grant was disbursed on April 17th, and you did not get a refund, it was likely applied to your school tuition bill. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CUNY/comments/x94w0o/a_guide_to_financial_aid_refunds_pell_tap_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button",

    "postText": "I'm a junior who transferred in Spring22, my gpa is a 2.173 currently (my first sem at Baruch absolutely sucked due to garbage profs). I've completed all the general and flexible courses and this semester I'm completing my comm minor because I literally had no other classes to take. I know my GPA will go up when the semester ends to meet zicklin requirements, but I'm worried about fall scheduling and not getting good classes in time since I'm currently not in zicklin. Does anyone know what I should do? I've already emailed zicklin admissions about this but I haven't received a response in 3 days. scheduling opens on the 29th... it really pisses me off like how long does it take to reply to a goddamn email when it's literally their JOB to deal w these issues.",

The better your GPA the more support you will receive. They view students who miss the GPA req as delinquents. Not saying you are but  that's the perception. \n\nYou need to make bigger waves you get help, go in person,  email your advisors consistently (be annoying it's cool, this isn't for free you are paying for this) and don't ever give up you got this.\n\n\nAlso a small recommendation: I noticed you wrote \"failed because of garbage professor\" Although there are bad professors @ Baruch, it is highly unlikely that you failed only due to that. I've seen students with the shittiest professors still make their way out with an A. Try to look within than blaming your external controllable factors. Make sure you identify what caused you to get such a low GPA in the first place and do not repeat the same mistake.\n\nGood luck!",

The class had a lot of information and concepts that you need to remember and twist to get the answer. The homework didn\u2019t help me to get ready for the midterm and final since all the questions were asking something that we didn\u2019t learned.\n\nHalf of my classmates failed the midterm. In my class, he used Proctorio which is quite annoying to set it up sometimes. The good thing is that he curved our grades.",

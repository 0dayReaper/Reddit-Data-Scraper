She gives you things to read, but it\u2019s not mandatory and u can just skim it if you want. Overall, easy A. Had only 1 discussion board assignment (1 paragraph) and final was an essay where you express what you learn and she gave you a week. 1 online midterm open book and everything is on the slides so pretty easy. She gives you one week to do the midterm, but it is timed, but I remember I had more than enough time to finish it. Just try to participate in the discussions but keep in mind attendance was not mandatory, only certain days were.",

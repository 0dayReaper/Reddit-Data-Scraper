            "comment": "Go to Bloomingdales and smell like everything they have, they got like so much shit which they also have niche fragrances. Nordstrom and Sephora are decent places also. You could use a website like fragrantica.com and search up a fragrance and see reviews, people also put the longevity and projection and also seasons to wear some colognes. Just smell which one is good to you but also be weary some colognes have a harsh opening and will need some time to dry down which will smell much better later on. One fragrance that I like is Mancera Cedrat Boise, but at the end of the day it is what smells good to you.",

If you're able to, spray their tester fragrances on yourself and see how the fragrance changes, as your skin and body can change how the fragrance will smell on you.  However, if you're short on time, I suggest REPLICA's Jazz Club, By the Fireplace and On a Date; YSL's Black Opium; NEST's Black Tulip.",

    "postText": "**Hey All, I received an email from Baruch about the graduation and saw this:**\n\n**NOTE:** Due to unprecedented participation in our Commencement program, some limited view seats will be opened up to accommodate all graduates the opportunity to bring guests. Any guest sitting in a limited view seat will still be able to view the ceremony on Barclays Center large LED jumbotron. We encourage your guests to arrive when doors open for first come first seating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone know if this is for guest who doesn't have tickets? Like are they allow to go in without a grad ticket? Because I am short on 1 grad ticket at the moment :(",

            "comment": "So basically a LOT of students are attending commencement than they are used to which is why some guest seats are going to be opened up behind the speakers. And if you\u2019ve already seen, some tickets arrive w rows and seats already assigned. From my understanding that doesn\u2019t matter, guess seats will be available on first come first serve basis. \n\nAs for your guest without a ticket, unfortunately they won\u2019t be able to attend. There are no more extra tickets available as you can probably guess that many guests will have to be behind speakers watching the commencement via a jumbotron.",

    "postText": "I submitted my last assignment this afternoon and that was my last as an undergraduate. I just wish I had a chance to say goodbye to the school in person, take a photo next to Bernard Baruch at the entrance, and leave. But, a new chapter opens everytime we close an old one. This reddit has been helpful. I wish everyone going for a few more semester, Good luck. For those graduating, may the odds be ever in your favor in the job market.",

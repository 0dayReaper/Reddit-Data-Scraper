    "postText": "I am currently an accounting major at Baruch. all my professors say I would be great at consulting and am definitely client-facing. with this advice, I'm taking it as I'm ok at accounting and I'm more of a people person, which kind of makes me want to switch to marketing. I am way more creative and talkative than most people that are in accounting, but I feel like it is the best major at Baruch for undergrad and is the most practical.  Is it crazy if i just stay accounting because I feel like its a safer bet?",

That being said, get that accounting degree but get a minor that relates to marketing in some way (not sure if baruch has that as a minor but I would think so) in addition to a liberal arts minor that\u2019s mandatory.",

Although I know that this is not by any means unheard of, I was wondering if there were any programs in Baruch that I could apply to and take advantage of my GPA in any way possible. I\u2019m in Zicklin and I\u2019m open to anything. Please let me know. Thanks.",

Make sure to apply to early insights programs outside of college (citi, J.P. Morgan\u2026.). With your GPA and hopefully good extracurriculars you would most likely get in. That is an automatic opportunity to gain the upper hand and get an internship for junior year! Go to more events and network! A good GPA is not everything, but it\u2019s one of the factors that might make you a more appealing candidate.",

I know Baruch accepts CLEP credit from incoming students, I just want to know if they will accept CLEP credits from students that are already matriculated at Baruch. I've already finished a year at Baruch, and want to know if I can take a CLEP exam over the summer and have the credits transfer in. So far, I haven't been able to get a sure answer about it.",

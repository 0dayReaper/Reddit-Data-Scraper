Unless if it persists until the end of summer, they are likely just work through either bureaucracy or ancient backend systems. If you are still worrying or impatient, check back in a week or two. If it's still like that, then check with financial aid services at Baruch or call or email into the TAP offices.",

If you registered for 12 credits+, it'll likely come back. I would be worried if it's close to the start of the semester and it hasn't come back.",

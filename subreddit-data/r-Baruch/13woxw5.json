    "postText": "So I am waitlisted for ECO 1002, and it says I am in position 4 for the recitation but I am not sure what position I am in for the lecture. If i get into the recitation, will I automatically get placed into the lecture since it has 6 available seats? (Never been waitlisted so im curious)",

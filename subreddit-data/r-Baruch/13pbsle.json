    "postText": "Tomorrow is my last day at Baruch, almost there and I gotta say.. it\u2019s been an experience lmao. Can\u2019t say it\u2019s been the best but honestly, it\u2019s not even bad. I\u2019ve had my ups and downs in terms of class performance but the ones I\u2019ve done bad in have been my fault and I can\u2019t blame the professors. I agree that professors do suck most of the time here, but I haven\u2019t had the worst experience with them. Anyway, here\u2019s my advice as a graduating student as a General CIS major.\n\n1) don\u2019t rely on RMP all the time for professor choices. People always say this but it\u2019s true. There\u2019s obvious bias in the reviews, one person\u2019s experience won\u2019t be the same as another\u2019s, etc etc. definitely use it as a baseline but look at reviews here and I believe you can also find reviews from the course evaluations online, but you can also ask here (best to first search the professors name so the sub isn\u2019t filled with 70 posts asking about the same professor)\n\n2) if you want friends, approach people and just ask and 9 times out of 10, people will be willing to be friends. My experience has always been positive with people who have wanted to be friends. I\u2019m definitely introverted but I\u2019m always willing to chill and talk to people who approach me &amp; that\u2019s true for a ton of students at Baruch. The social scene isn\u2019t dead at all and there are tons of groups/clubs to join so if a social experience/group is what you want, you can easily find it. I\u2019ve also just talked to people for 1 semester and never contacted them outside and that\u2019ll also happen most of the time. \n\n3) group projects are plentiful. You\u2019ll have groups who actually put effort in the class and do the work, but you\u2019ll most likely have groups where people don\u2019t do anything till last minute. If you want something done, take lead and do your part, encourage people to do their work, and if they fall short, be that person who lets the professor know. It\u2019s college, people should be responsible and respectful for their work and unless there\u2019s a legit reason and established beforehand why they\u2019re slacking. I get last minute problems happen, but if it\u2019s constant, then that\u2019s their problem and they should talk to the professor about it.\n\n4) take advantage of Baruch resources. SACC, star, writing center, the tech available (may not be the best but it does come in clutch if available), the counseling services, printing, etc etc etc. it\u2019s all included in your tuition so it\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d - use them!\n\n5) CIS general is more of a project management concentration than a coding/technical one. But it\u2019s still worth it if that\u2019s what you like! You get opportunities to take courses related to the other concentrations (data analytics &amp; cybersecurity) and get the knowledge there. With the new CS major coming around, if software engineering is what you want to do, go for that, but I\u2019ve had  pretty good experiences with the CIS classes I\u2019ve taken. \n\nThat\u2019s all for now! I\u2019ll be dropping this account next week so if you have any questions, feel free to ask but I wish everyone the best of luck and a great summer!",

                    "comment": "So I sorta made the mistake of accepting a job offer as a software engineer associate (part of the TDP for a company) with veryyyy little coding knowledge and only experience I have is literally the intro python class and object oriented programming in c++ lol but you should definitely look for opportunities in companies that have a TDP (technology development program) for internships as well as analytical/project management internships. I didn\u2019t pursue internships till it was a little too late but the first one I accepted turned out to be a job lmao. If you haven\u2019t taken it already, I definitely recommend taking CIS 3120 which is data analytics/object oriented programming in python because it\u2019s more useful than cis 3100 which is object oriented in c++\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in programming/coding, take internship opportunities revolving that, but make sure to prepare yourself beforehand. There are free online programs/courses you can take (like courseacademy, py4e, coursera, etc)",

    "postText": "Good morning everyone!\n\nI was curious about how students pursuing a CPA fulfilling their credit requirements. As far as I\u2019m aware BBA is 124 and if you are to take an additional minor that will only be 9 more credits. What are some other ways people are planning to complete the required 150 credits? (Without going for their MBA)\n\nHope a great day ahead for everyone :)",

You could easily get the credits from a community college using CLEP/FEMA. If you plan to go into public and transition out the Master is definitely a leg up. If you don't plan on staying in accounting but want the CPA to get a master's in something that can benefit you! Information Systems and Finance are great degrees to combine with accounting to pivot into other accounting adjacent fields.",

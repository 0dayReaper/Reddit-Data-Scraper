Homework\u2019s are just discussion board posts, quizzes are open book &amp; online, attendance doesn\u2019t really matter but he doesn\u2019t post notes/slides mainly cause he lectures and the slides show topics and general things. There\u2019s a semester long group project where you solve a business problem of your choosing and you create a system to the best of your ability (website, database, etc). There are 4 presentations you have to do but they\u2019re just project updates to show your groups progress. I\u2019d recommend him, especially if you do have classes or something to do beforehand cause there are times where he\u2019s had to cancel class due to travel or something else. He\u2019s available if needed and most of the time he ends class early.",

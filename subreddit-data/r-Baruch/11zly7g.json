    "postText": "How hard is the COM minor. I heard people say it's the easiest minor for a GPA boost, but I'm not that great at public speaking, so I'm a bit nervous.\n\nAre the classes more writing intensive than speaking or a bit of both? Thanks.\n\nAlso, if I were to take COM 3021 which is a base requirement, would that count towards my 3 minor classes?",

            "comment": "I\u2019ll be honest, I came into it with the presumption that it will be incredibly easy. Now I realized it depends on the professor and their test/ grading policies. I took intercultural communication with Gail Quets over the summer and that was very easy and no final or tests. However I am now taking executive communication and although the work is just presentations and listening to textbook readings, the tests are short response and extremely specific. Destroyed my average for the class and no curve at all. So I would say in terms of work load, it should be definitely the easiest but in terms of grading, depends on professor for the tests. Now com 3021 i had a completely different experience. We had only presentations and I had Pamela thielman and regardless of how I did, she gave a 95 on every assignment plus 0 tests.",

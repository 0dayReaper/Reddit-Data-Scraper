            "comment": "For excel - Is the linkedin course free? If not, there are so many free youtube videos that you can learn from.\n\nI assume you know the basics. Tabs, sheets, navigating excel, etc. If not, start there. Learning some keyboard shortcuts won't hurt either (like ctrl+arrow down to quickly go to the bottom of a column, ctrl+home to go to cell A1, alt+= under a column to sum it..)\n\nOnce comfortable there, start learning simple formula's, like a simple sum formula which is always handy. The biggest misconception about being \"good\" at excel is thinking its all about being a formula wiz. No. In the professional setting, its about taking a data set and extracting exactly the information you need there and knowing WHEN to use that formula.\n\nA good handy dataset with real information you can practice with? Your bank transactions. If you have an account, log in on the computer and download your transactions into a csv file. Then start practicing sums, go on to vlookups/xlookup, pivot tables. Those all have tons of video guides on youtube as well.",

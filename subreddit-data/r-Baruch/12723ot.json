Cap and grown prices are crazy and we have to buy our tickets through Ticketmaster \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nI didn\u2019t even get to take graduation pictures! The last day to take them was in February and didn\u2019t even receive an email about it. Baruch is foul for that but I\u2019m just considering going on a vacation instead. \n\nThoughts and opinions graduating studnets\ud83c\udfa4\ud83c\udfa4",

Just borrow someone else's cap and gown take a few pictures and go about your way and save yourself the money &amp; 3 hours of listening to President Wu and random no name speakers of how 'you made it, but still dont know what you want in life' messages you'll hear.",

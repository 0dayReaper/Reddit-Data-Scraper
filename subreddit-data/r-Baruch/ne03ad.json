And one of them acted like they did something and when i asked her for help she laughed and said \"I'm not doing someone else's work\" and said i was being rude(LOL). I ended up doing mostly everything. Should i complain to the prof or do you think its useless? I hate these damn group works.\n\nUpdate: Thanks guys I certainly will report it to the prof, hope he understands.",

Had a guy who didn't a single thing even though I gave a specified task 3 weeks in advance. Didn't put his name, and I don't think he realized he got a 0 for the project that was worth 20% of his final grade.",

But I am guessing that most of the people here are overachievers and we tend to shut down the ideas of others especially if they go against how we want to project to go. I wonder if sometimes the reason for poor participation is that overachievers take over and also don\u2019t know how to get help from others. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2026 there are def people who take advantage. But there are others who maybe just step away after their ideas are shut down.",

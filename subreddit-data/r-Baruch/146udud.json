Ceremony only in May, and no opportunities to let students go to stage one by one due to Baruch is sooo poor. Maybe Baruch will say back that this ceremony Absolutely deserves your tuition \ud83e\udd23 wanna make a ceremony special, hey, help with Baruch get sponsorship, but kinda like daydreaming!",

            "comment": "Yes if your interested in both tech and business I would recommend it. General tracks are more project management related for the major require course.  \n\n\nI would recommend the general track b/c there is a lot of freedom to choose the classes between analytics and cyber security. I personally choose general b/c I like the analytics class but not all of them so I choose general to take some, and i also like management in projects.\n\nAs for interns, there are a lot of opportunities in a lot of fields.",

The track emphasizes systems analysis and IT project management so it is well suited for targeting job roles such as [Systems Analyst](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-systems-analysts.htm).\n\nYou may also wish to review [employment outcomes](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/starr-career-development-center/post-graduate-outcomes/outcomes-by-major/) for different majors.",

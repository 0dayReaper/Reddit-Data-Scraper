    "postText": "Hello, I'm an incoming freshman to Baruch next year and I'm having serious trouble in deciding if I made a good decision. I'm an economics major, however to be competitive in economics you need to have pretty much your PhD. I'm in between Baruch College &amp; Binghamton University. I already committed to Baruch as it is in the city and can give year-round internships, however to really break through in the field of economics you need research, which Baruch does not have much of. On the flip side, there is Binghamton where it has greater rankings on economics, but it is incredibly far from home and in the middle of nowhere. There is nothing said about research when I went to college tour there unless it had to do with engineering.  I also find the best paying economics majors come from crazy prestigious schools, but the average income for those are still less than 100K. Heck, both average income after college for these two are around 44K. Should I be confident in my commitment? Or should I change it? What should I do? I heard a lot of crap about the economics department from both schools. I think I am on the BA track (since I was a naive applicant) and looking at some posts I think I should change to a BBA. Is that possible? And if so how do I do that? Should I do that? Do you think I would be more successful (i.e. making that mulah) doing that? I have a class called AP Research under my belt where zi pretty much created my own research study for a class, do you think that can help or is valuable in any way?",

            "comment": "I think you need to do a bit of soul searching, as it seems like you don't have grasp of what you want to do after your Bachelor's. I would say this, tak your first year a little easier by working on your general education courses, but try out as many clubs and as many programs as you can. Go to as many GIM as possible, and try to recruit some friends for the ones you can't make it to. After that test phase, see which ones stuck with you most, and what made them stand out. If it was something business related, perhaps getting a BBA is more beneficial. Maybe tech was more appealing, then either CIS or CS is the right move. Whatever stuck out to you, consult with the people in that club, and get their opinions on this. And if possible, if you get a professor that you feel comfortable talking to, get the professor's opinion as a typically neutral perspective (English is pretty good for this). After your process of soul searching is done, if the school or major does not feel right, then you always have the option to change. \n\nAnd as for your question for changing majors, if you spent just 2 minutes typing into Google, major change form, it should be one of the top results.",

If you intent to go to graduate school you will find economics research opportunities between Baruch/CUNY Grad center and all the non profits in NYC.   You seem like a city kid, so start at Baruch, get involved, and the course work will show you the best path forward.",

            "comment": "It is great that you're having these thoughts before you start college and not during a critical time like junior year. Based on your post, it sounds like money is a factor that's important to you and that the average income for an econ grad isn't at all ideal. 44K for a college grad? It's hard to be confident in your commitment to econ knowing that's the salary figure that awaits you after college. That kind of salary is extremely limiting in the sense of where you can live and what you can do. You'll have barely any money leftover after taxes and rent. \n\nAfter taxes, you'll be sitting with realistically around $32K (thanks Uncle Sam). I imagine you would want to have your own place after college as well. Well, most places in Manhattan wouldn't even give you the time of day as some require a 40x rent rule. Would you be ok with living with a roommate in the outer boroughs just so you can afford rent and not have your entire paycheck wiped or even continue living with your parents after college? Think about that for a second. \n\nNo matter where you work after college, work is going to be work. I highly recommend choosing a field where you'll be better compensated. I chose to study finance based on that line of thinking and I'm very fortunate to have landed a job that will pay me six figures post-grad. People might tell you that money doesn't buy happiness and do what makes you happy but money and happiness aren't mutually exclusive. I promise you'll be much happier pursuing a career where you'll never have to think about how you're going to pay the bills.",

            "comment": "First, you do not need a PhD in Economics to be competitive. This is just not true. What\u2019s also untrue is the average salary information you have for the degree. Hopefully in College you will learn research skills so you will be able to make better decisions. \n\nWhat you do have right here is pursing an economics business degree as opposed to humanities degree. That\u2019s how you will earn the most money. \n\n You can do your undergrad at Baruch and then transfer somewhere else to do further studies if you wish. \n\nan Econ degree is very valuable and as a former econ\nMajor I wish you the best.",

            "comment": "Genuinely, with an Economics degree form Baruch, you\u2019re most likely to get some type of analyst role or a middle office role just like the finance majors. An increasing number but still a relatively small group of finance majors have been recently breaking into middle office investment banking for front office. The same opportunities will be present for Econ majors. Now it seems as if you\u2019re more focused on the research/academia side of economics research rather actually working. And you are correct, it\u2019ll be very hard for you to find research opportunities related to economics as an undergraduate especially from baruch. Your best bet is to get a masters in economics whether it be pure or applied. This is where more of the research opportunities will be present. Do the Baruch economics (BA) major rather than the BBA Econ major, although they are very similar, the BBA has more tedious business electives/requirements. In addition, being in weissman for the BA major will allow you to pursue a double major if you really want to later in as opposed to the BBA major in zicklin where you can\u2019t. A lot of economics courses will be more applied at the graduate level and will focus on more math, so you might want to minor in math or double major in math (don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s allowed).",

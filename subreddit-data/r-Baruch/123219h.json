    "postText": "Can i enroll in the same course for two different semesters? \n\nFor example, say I am already enrolled in Summer 2023 for Fin 4610, can I register for it again in Fall 2023 before completing it? I am only doing this in case I can't get a seat in Fall for some of the classes. Any insight would be appreciated",

            "comment": "I had ennoure, he\u2019s chill in the sense that his lectures are quick and he\u2019ll answer questions for the most part. Lectures include him pretty much speed reading slides and then going through a coding example for classwork. You just submit it at the end of class and the assignments due are based off the classwork. Sometimes they\u2019re a little bit harder but overall, very easy class and professor. Attendance doesn\u2019t matter but I\u2019d recommend going to class to keep up, I believe he still teaches the 3hr sections, and his classes normally end earlier, they\u2019re typically an hour, an hour and a half max. Exams are online, 20-25 mc &amp; true/false theory section and then a coding problem where you\u2019d write a program.",

The solutions for the lab are given in class so if you\u2019re really confused, you can wait till he goes over it but definitely try to get used to coding. When he\u2019s teaching, he just quickly goes over the slides and materials, so be sure to ask questions if you\u2019re lost and he\u2019ll typically explain it. And all exams are online and open book.",

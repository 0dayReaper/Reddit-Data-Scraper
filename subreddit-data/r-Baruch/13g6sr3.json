I know I should have had internships set up before bla bla. I transferred in and last semester started working full-time until the mortgage industry burned to the ground. Where could I go from here?   \n\n\nMajor: Marketing Management (BBA)  \nGood Excel skills: Piviots, vlookup, macros.\n\nCurrently learning SQL.   \n\n\nLooking for ideas, advice, or any good certifications.

            "comment": "Hi alum here from 2020 (Finance). I graduated as well during possibly the worst time ever without an offer lined up and after a few months i ran into some luck. A few things helped in hindsight.\n\n1. Re-evaluate strengths. You have certain soft and hard skills that can distinguish you from any other candidates out there.\n\n2. Are you getting rejected before even getting interviews? Have you had final round interviews? If no \u2014 bolster your resume. Words that are mentioned on it are generic and not a fit and not tailored to what any Hiring Manager is looking for. I spent nearly 5 days reworking my resume, making cover letters to tailor it for every position i was looking could be a fit.\n\n3. Quality over quantity. Solidly applying to 3 jobs in a day (making resume look like their qualifications / description as you best see fit) is much more efficient than mass applying to 30. Same applies with linkedin profiles.\n\n4. Dont jump at the first offer if you are not sold on it. After many fails i was offered a 60k teaching position which i wasnt appealed to, i did not want to work in a school at all. My parents tried pushing me to accept, i did not. I then was interviewing for a sales job at a big bank, was great, i was deep in the process but realized i didnt really have a passion for it. In the middle of that interview, i was also applying to be a trader for a smaller firm. I leveraged the offer from sales job to push some pressure for the Trading job. Received the trading offer and its what ive been with ever since.\n\nThe job search after college is exhausting, demotivating. But it lets you seek within, you have cards to play too. Its not about role/company ever, its about how you control what is presented to you. Coding/Data Familiarity helps so much too, keep on with SQL it is a career key. Best of luck!",

Go to major company websites and look through opportunities pages regularly. There will be alot of rejections and no interviews. Just need to apply to as much as possible",

Downside the work life balance isn't the best. And the pay can be low (40k-55k) but you can job hop once you gain some experience.",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m currently enrolled in a communications course over the summer but saw that there\u2019s seats open for MKT 3000. I was wondering if any of you have taken MKT 3000 over the summer and think it\u2019s better to take it over a 5 week period than taking it during the fall. The professor is Melanie Austin and I can\u2019t find many reviews on her so if you would recommend me taking the class with her, please lmk!!",

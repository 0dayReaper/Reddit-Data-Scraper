When I am getting coffee and or a donut and waiting near the cart I have seen them grab people by the hand and basically block people and in theory and principle it is harder to do this with a tall guy rather than a short guy and or a girl due to them having less mass to work with. It is just what I noticed a couple of times I have seen them while I get my coffee and donut.",

They\u2019re like \u2018you look like a good person\u2019.  It\u2019s been like five more times around the city they\u2019ve tried to stop me and get in front of my walking path.  I loudly say \u2018no\u2019 or \u2018leave me alone\u2019.  Just tell them to fuck off.  I know it\u2019s very irritating and I think it\u2019s a scam by one company hiring students (it\u2019s always Baruch for some reason) for different \u2018causes\u2019, like it was mostly breast cancer before and idk what this is now.  Blatantly tell them to fuck off.  Idk who we can contact",

            "comment": "Hello! Former fundraiser here :)\n\nI\u2019d like to clear up some misconceptions here in the thread. First of all, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that some people had bad experiences with the people representing this client. If anyone brought that up to the organization, you did the right thing. They\u2019ll definitely take care of it.\n\nWhat you saw is called Face To Face Fundraising. Also called Face To Face Sales or Direct Sales. It\u2019s very popular in the UK then quickly made its way to America. Many charities and campaigns have picked up on the idea and thought it was an amazing way to advertise and give back to the community :)\n\nFun fact, face to face is actually the cheapest form of fundraising. Other donations via website or check tend to use a bigger portion of the money to fund their media market. If my recollection is correct, most direct sales only holds 13% of the production for the fundraisers (providing their uniforms, badges, pitch cards, etc) and the other 87% goes directly to the cause. \n\nAs for the cash situation, they cannot take cash because it will not go directly to the charity. It is illegal for non-independent fundraisers to take cash, correct. It\u2019s almost like if you were to give a homeless person cash - how would you know where your money is going and how it is helping? The card system is used to maintain financial transparency between the customer and the client.\n\nI saw somebody ask about pay. Yes, most of the times it is a paid job. Here\u2019s where the confusion\u2019s at: These fundraisers are typically hired by a third party, rarely hired by the client directly. Meaning, whatever they make off commission/hourly is NOT coming out of your donation - it\u2019s coming from the business that represents that client. So no, you are not directly adding to someone\u2019s paycheck by making a donation. Yes, your donation does go the charity and the cause. They are getting paid by another organization that\u2019s affiliated with the charity they are representing, not the charity itself :)\n\nIf I may give a word of advice, it\u2019s this: If you are unable to say no or walk away when you are uninterested in something, that\u2019s a skill that you will need to develop in order to live in NYC. Everyone has a hustle, everyone is trying to sell you something. If you would feel better by not contributing to someone\u2019s cause, you can always respectfully decline and a GOOD salesman will tell you to have a great day and proceed to do what they\u2019re doing :) \n\nI will gladly answer any more questions! I\u2019ve worked on many campaigns during my time in this field. For those who took action and stuck up for themselves after their bad encounters, good. Nobody deserves to be harassed into a sale. Btw, this is for everyone who commented on this thread. Please, share this around and tag your friends. Overall, these teams have their heart in the right place :)\n\nThank you!",

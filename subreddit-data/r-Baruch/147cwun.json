    "postText": "Long story short:\n\nI switched majors and as a result, no longer need a summer class I'm enrolled in. I submitted my major switch last Thursday, but my new major hasn't been updated yet.\n\nI think because of this, I can't drop the summer class. CunyFirst is giving me an error saying I can't drop because it's tied to another summer course (which I also need for the new major). That other class is full and I need it, so I can't drop and re-enroll.\n\nThe last day for full refund is today (the 11th) but I can't drop. I emailed my situation to Bursar to let them know, but their mailbox is full and my email isn't reaching them.\n\nAny advice on what should I do to be able to get the full refund?",

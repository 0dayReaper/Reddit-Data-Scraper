One time it took me four weeks to get into a class, as even though the seats were open it took some time to update. \n\nYou are not enrolled until it says enrolled. It\u2019ll update you when you are enrolled into the class that is true, but as the system still hasn\u2019t updated, you were not enrolled yet. In conclusion, stay calm, and be patient.",

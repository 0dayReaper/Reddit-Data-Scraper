    "postText": "Hello all, me and a couple of other members are on our way to making Baruchblockchain an official club. \nWe will have our first General Interest meeting after spring break, but for now I would like to hear from everyone on what they would like to see from our club, so we have a better sense of how to structure it. Whether that be learning about blockchain infrastructure, Nfts, DAOs cryptocurrency etc any idea is appreciated. Thank you!",

I will say as much as Baruch students love to shit on Baruch for it's highly bureaucratic and inefficient admin, lack of campus life and generally soulless student population, (exhibit A: the cake above)  I personally think that the education was quality, especially considering the fact that I paid virtually nothing for my degree thanks to financial aid. Zicklin grad programs from what I know are pretty well regarded by employers, just be prepared to wrestle with the infamous admin to get anything done in a timely manner.",

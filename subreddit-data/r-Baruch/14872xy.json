I recently found out that I messed up and took a wrong class so I haven\u2019t met the graduation requirement and BMCC isnt giving me my degree. \nDo you guys think I would still be able to attend Baruch without an AS and just re-take those classes later?? I have been accepted and attened the orientation etc. Thanks sm",

They are probably under the impression that you have it and will have a guaranteed transfer to a senior CUNY school. \n\nYou should call and ask to find out what kind of transfer you fall into? Regular transfer or the AA/AS degree guaranteed transfer program. \n\nGood luck!",

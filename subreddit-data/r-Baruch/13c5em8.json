    "postText": "This is more of an anxious thought than something that is happening. I am taking a photography class and it\u2019s beating the shit out of me. \n\nThe professor is subjective as hell. I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be this complicated. But so far, I\u2019ve been passing the class. \n\nBut I\u2019m anxious about the final project. What if she gives me a bad score and I fail this course. Wtf do I do?\n\nIt\u2019s just an elective for credit. \n\nBut has anyone been in this situation? What did you do? \n\nI\u2019m about to graduate on the 30th.",

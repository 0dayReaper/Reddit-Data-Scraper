Use Reddit instead.\n\nHaving friends: Definitely! Apart from hanging out, they can help to get internships, connections, etc. I am also introverted, so it\u2019s okay if you take the initiate to connect with people.\n\nStairs: It gets crowded between 3-4pm. Take your precautions if you are in a rush.\n\nWorkload: Depends of what major are you doing. What I know is that Finance and Accounting are hard here.\n\nAdvice for mentally draining: Manage your time wisely. Plan ahead.",

            "comment": "Definitely use rate my professor reviews to have a general understanding of a professor but take them with a grain of salt as they are not always accurate and can leave out details. Try to check reddit if anyone also has comments on a professor. As for having friends, it really depends on you. Some ppl don't care and just go to school and go home, but if you want to make some memories and have somewhat of an enjoyable experience, try and put in the effort to make friends so that you don't feel lonely. Making friends isn't an easy process but a good start is joining active clubs and being an active member. Going to one meeting is not gonna make you 10 friends right off the bat. Stay involved with campus activities. The workload depends on your major and yeah the stairs suck so people tend to wait for the elevators or even use the escalators to avoid walking. I would definitely say not to stress too much on your grades, having a 4.0 won't mean anything in the long run, just do your best and whatever grade you get is whatever you get. Take breaks, don't over exert yourself. Always make time for yourself atleast one day a week where you're not doing ANY type of school work. I would suggest to start prepping for internships as early as you can. Learn about writing resumes, making a LinkedIn profile, even writing cover letters. Pay attention to emails about internship/career opportunities and inquire if it interests you. Take advantage of the internships that CUNY offers like the Spring Forward, Career Launch, and Cultural Corps, check to see if there's internships in your field of study. You don't have to stress on landing an internship your freshmen year but definitely start prepping for it so you're not stressing later down the line. Going back to clubs, join clubs in your field of study which you can add to your resume.",

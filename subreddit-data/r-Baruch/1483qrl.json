I meet all the requirements and submitted it correctly.\n\nI've been denied for other classes in the past as well.\n\nThis is what it says:\n\n\\*ATTN\\* Please submit valid and eligible e-permits by carefully reviewing  policies, procedures, regulations, and restrictions first. --&gt; [https://enrollmentmanagement.baruch.cuny.edu/registrar/epermit/](https://enrollmentmanagement.baruch.cuny.edu/registrar/epermit/)| If there are policies/procedures you happen to not agree with, please don't apply and opt to take the course at Baruch College instead. Many thanks.             more  &gt; &gt; Denied.    \\[\\] Permit Type inaccuracy.

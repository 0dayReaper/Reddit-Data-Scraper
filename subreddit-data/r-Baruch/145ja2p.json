My end goal is Marketing Analytics, and in order to get into the Zicklin School of Business I must take Pre-Calculus at Baruch as I cannot e-permit it. I was at a four-year school prior to this but have never taken calculus/precalc and I'm pretty bad at math to be honest.** \n\n**Do you guys suggest I transfer to BMCC and try to get my pre-reqs done there and \\*then\\* reapply to Baruch, or just thug it out and see if I can manage to pass PreCalc at Baruch? Tbh the calculus horror stories have me shaken up and I just don't know what to do. I appreciate all help.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: I'm scared of taking precalc/calculus at Baruch so I'm considering deferring to BMCC for a semester or two.**",

I took most of the required credits at BMCC and 75 of them were accepted. Yes, it took longer but with BMCC, I could work full-time. At least, I am not one of those who could work full time while working at Baruch. I did it for a couple of semesters but, it deteriorated my grades. Baruch is a difficult school to be honest and the competition there is a lot. At BMCC, they go easy on you.",

Also, if you get courses done at BMCC, once you transfer to Baruch your GPA will reset, which is great. The transfer from BMCC to Baruch is very straightforward as well, BMCC is great and they have a ton of resources at the LRC to help you out, while at Baruch taking advantage of said resources is quite competitive, as are the courses themselves. Community schools also generally receive much more merit based, and need based scholarships and grants, if that matters to you.",

The reason they are scary is because they have a high failure rate, but because of that these programs carry prestige. A badge of honor. Running to BMCC will set a precedent for the rest of your life \"this is too hard, I am going to run away.\" What you do with this obstacle here today, will define you for the rest of your life. \n\nBaruchs math &amp; finance program will either break you, or turn you into a diamond from all that pressure.

It\u2019s just a matter of perspective\u2014maybe to you it seems like \u201crunning\u201d but I\u2019m sure if you changed your perspective you could see it as taking the most efficient and *cost-effective* method possible. \n\nAt the end of the day, I\u2019m trying to get in and out bro. I\u2019ve spoken with a few data analysts who are friends of mine, and while it\u2019s not *exactly* marketing analytics the work is similar enough (to a degree). ALL of them have stated that they NEVER use calculus. So is it really running if the obstacle in question isn\u2019t something I\u2019ll have to revisit later? \n\nDon\u2019t take this as an attack, because I do believe there is some merit to your statement. However, for someone like me who has never even taken a pre calculus course in high-school, or isn\u2019t even particularly strong in algebra I prefer to not be thrown into the fire and burn. I don\u2019t want to burn thousands of dollars if there\u2019s another option that may potentially save me the money, time, and headaches.",

Would you be okay with a bachelor's from BMCC? \n\nAnd the lessons you learn won't be about calculus. I took upto Cal II and I barely remember algebra, not the point here. You will learn how to overcome what you consider a difficult obstacle. That experience on how to handle something where you will \"burn\", is priceless.

There are Baruch-specific YouTube videos for every lecture and for the final, loads of practice tests, and free tutoring through SACC. Do all of the above. If your professor allows a formula sheet for quizzes/tests, make one every time. Show up to tutoring prepared with questions. Frankly, I think a lot of my classmates didn't realize how much study time was actually required until it was too late. They procrastinated on the homework and suffered. You can do it!",

Their math classes have the same rigor and intensity as international courses and ivy leagues. It was the first time, I felt challenged after a while and throughly enjoyed it. The enjoyment part of course is subjective, but it changed me. It made me a better person because of the academic rigor. I learned many valuable lessons, lessons you will miss out on by going to BMCC.\n\nLook no judgments here, I took the epermit bmcc route for Spanish, I get it \ud83d\ude05.

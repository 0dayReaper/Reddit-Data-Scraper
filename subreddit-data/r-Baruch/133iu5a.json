    "postText": "Hello, I am failing Calc I (MTH 2610) and planning to withdraw from this course. Even if I pass the final exam, I will pass with a D+. So I am thinking about withdrawing Calc I now and retaking it this summer but will this affect my financial aid? I am currently taking 16 credits and will only finish 12 credits if I withdraw from Calc I and I have already received refunds from financial aid which I was wondering if I had to pay back. I also want to know if I could receive financial aid for MTH 2610 (4 Credit Course) in the summer. \n\nI mainly want to pass Calc I with a good grade because I am transferring to Hunter for Computer Science this Fall 2023, and I wish to take Calc II as soon as I get there so I could get transfer credits since I want to transfer to a University after 2 years of CUNY.",

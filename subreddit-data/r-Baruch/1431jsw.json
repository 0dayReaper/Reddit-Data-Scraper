    "postText": "Recently graduated with a BBA in finance from Baruch college in nyc. My gpa is a 3.0(had to sacrifice time to give money to the family) And I have no internships in my resume. The only thing I\u2019ve been doing for the past three years is working as a manager at a check cashing place. I really want to get out of here and find a new job. What would you guys recommend?",

Do a resume review and work on it with them, and then do a mock interview. Once your resume is polished up, start applying! If you ace the interview, and talk about your managerial experience in a certain good way you\u2019ll be good. Leverage your experience, and the skills you learned through baruch and your work experience. It may seem like nothing much to you, but if you format it in the right way, it can seem like much more than it is.",

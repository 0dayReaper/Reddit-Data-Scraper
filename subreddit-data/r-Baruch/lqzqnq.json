    "postText": "1-Please do your research on the professors you select. The material could be the easiest and suddenly it will become living hell for you if you choose the \"wrong\" professor.\n\n2-Group work- Don't wait for others to do their part. Do your part and have an understanding of what everyone's part is about so you can improvise when you need to!\n\n3- Don't wait for others in your class to initiate a conversation, you start first and learn to communicate effectively with your peers (you never know if you are chatting with the next CEO, COO, CFO, CMO) and make sure you ask professor's mid semester: \"Hi professor, I really enjoyed all the lectures in your class and your style of teaching is one of the best i've ever experienced. If needed, may i use your valued name as a reference, letter of reco in the near future?\"\n\n4- Don't get caught up in toxicity of students, professors, reviews.. etc LEARN TO MOVE ON\n\n5- Say Thank you when someone does something nice for you, like help you with homework or explain a concept to you.\n\nGood luck!",

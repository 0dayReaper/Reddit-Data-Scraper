Gillespie is very kind and helpful. Schedule is doable but if you\u2019re working, you\u2019d have to manage your time wisely!",

My recommendation would be that if you have a job outside of school then you consider dropping one of the classes. However, if you\u2019re ok with like working a lot then you\u2019re good. If you\u2019re thinking of dropping, I would recommend dropping opm, or pol. People usually take opm after they take mgt and when they are juniors around. Plus the class can prove to be pretty tricky and difficult. Pol is a simple class and honestly would drop only if you think you\u2019ll be overwhelmed. It\u2019s only if you don\u2019t want to drop any of the harder classes. This class can be retaken later on if anything.",

Agrees to all get on X time and surprise! 2-3 makes excuses saying they can\u2019t attend. Repeats process until semester ends :) oh and the fact that half of my group hasn\u2019t attended class at all and only came the last month of class. Groups are terrible at Baruch",

Absolutely disaster , no clue about anything just entitlement to all, and professors keep telling you about collaborating and team-working. If they are so naive or they do not really care what they produce???",

Things you see in high school just expect to see them again at Baruch. Classes that aren\u2019t in lecture halls feels like your in high school classroom as well.",

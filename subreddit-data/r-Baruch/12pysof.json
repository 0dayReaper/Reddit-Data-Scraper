And if you travel to another country you need to ALSO have that countries vaccinations to enter? You had over 2 years to get a vaccination, you should have gotten it by now or youre a clown. The reason why you're not seeing as much news about it (and btw Covid is still a thing), is because the average person has gotten it and we have HERD IMMUNITY. This is something you should have learned about in high school biology.",

He didn\u2019t follow the grade breakdown on the syllabus since he didn\u2019t assign half the work that was on there. One midterm, one final. We had one project which he gave no feedback for. Overall, it\u2019s an easy class if your grouped with the right ppl, like most MKT classes. But don\u2019t expect to learn anything.",

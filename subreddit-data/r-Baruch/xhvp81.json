Not implying it made a huge impact, but I assume a percentage of students dropped out because of it, or they didn't get the vaccine in time or only had one shot and not two. I suspect the main reason is the reduction of online classes. It gave people a lot of flexibility.",

Additionally baruch accepts a lot of transfer students, some of which are lazy as fuck and thinks baruch is an extension of community college. They chose to be in baruch, so put in the work to belong in baruch.",

They literally built a Vertical Campus without reliable escalators and elevators lol. Like in the last decade. If anything Baruch should do more to accommodate working class adults and other unconventional students tbh.",

The whole message is just them playing dumb and ignoring the shit that their students are going through this semester. it does not matter if all the classes are online, and if families have lost loved ones and jobs during this pandemic. there are many of us who are still working in full contact with others because thats what has to be done to survive during times like this. this message is tone deaf as they lack perception on what students are going through, and its truly disgusting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/af4ifqjlsn261.png?width=501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f027b6a44b535d0caedd008990abeb3864b23f83",

We wouldn't be here otherwise.  I agree that the administration (really institution that's part of a larger system for that matter) dropped the ball in this regard.  There should have been a more proactive approach to addressing potential future, lingering concerns, and by the time it was looked at, the ship had sailed and it can't be turned around without some serious issues.  \n\nThere's other means to have your [individual concerns addressed](https://enrollmentmanagement.baruch.cuny.edu/undergraduate-advisement-orientation/appealsanddismissals/) on a case by case basis, but there's not going to be an \"en masse fix\" (which I personally don't think is necessary) for the student body on the whole.

For example, my full-time buddies are getting thrown more work because their superiors think they have the time for it because of the lack of commute time. \n\nYou're right that some profs are terrible at online teaching, and will post assignments late and whatnot, but they all grade on a curve anyway, so as long as you do less shitty than your other classmates there shouldn't be a problem",

Meanwhile, the rest of us, who are trying our best with schoolwork, work or lack of work, lack of adequate learning space/environment, and sick family members have to ALSO deal with profs who seem to have gotten worse at teaching as time has passed since the beginning of pandemic and a college that couldn\u2019t care less. Also, if you have issues with your employer, take it up with them. This issue is about Baruch\u2019s lack of consideration for their students. Sending out information about mental health awareness, while ignoring distressed messages from students who don\u2019t know how they will make it past the semester is despicable on their part. They don\u2019t care about us at all, and I would take a gander and say people who have your unsympathetic mindset are who pushed this decision. This is how a college loses students. Instead of trying to help aid us in our turmoil, they throw us to the wolves and veil their \u201cf you\u201d attitude in a nice, long email full of empty euphemisms.",

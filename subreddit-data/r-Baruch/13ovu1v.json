    "postText": "Hello, I just graduated with my associates degree from a community college and will be transferring to Baruch this Fall. I\u2019ll be majoring in Finance with a minor in C.S. and commuting from home. \n\nI used to be very active at my CC and loved opportunities for personal and professional growth. That being said, I also got to know a lot of things very late that I wish I knew during my Freshman year as it would have helped me a lot. \n\nFor those who have been at Baruch for a while, what are some things you wish you knew when you started your journey here and what advice would you give to those who are trying to make best out of their time at Baruch? Also any tips on joining clubs or networking would really help. TIA!",

            "comment": "I wish I knew that joining clubs was extremely easy and the career fair isn't a useful tactic to find out more about the clubs. All you need to do is search them up on Instagram, and around September, start coming to their events.\n\nYou can also apply for club mentorship and analyst programs via their Link Tree/websites if you are interested (boosts resume, the opportunity to learn, and a great place to try to make friends). Still, don't expect to get in easily into their programs because some will ask technical questions during the interviews, so be ready (do your research). Also, don't be afraid to reach out to people in these clubs via LinkedIn, as most would be happy to talk to you about them!\n\nSomeone here even created a page devoted to outlining all of Baruch's clubs.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Baruch/wiki/index/clubs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baruch/wiki/index/clubs/)\n\nThere are a lot of opportunities, but a lot of individuals just don't look for these opportunities at Baruch, and trust me, they are there. You really need to take the initiative, and you can't expect everything to just work out somehow. Also, the career center is pretty helpful with resume reviews, LinkedIn reviews, and mock interviews. Not really helpful in advising, though.\n\nAll in all, work hard, network, take the initiative, and get involved, but don't forget to take some time for yourself and take a break when needed, and enjoy yourself!",

Also, they literally break down every other day. So, plan to be there early if you want to avoid any of the rush.",

May the odds be ever in your favor\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffcgetting great professors at Baruch is super competitive due to majority of low quality staff.\n\n2. Always research your professors and what to expect. I was fortunate enough to get 4 star+ Professors in my 2.5 years at Baruch.\n\n3. Join clubs that you are interested in and/or you\u2019re majoring in. Find out internships/ apprenticeships you can join prior to it being time to apply to these internships.\n\n4. Stay on top of your schoolwork. Put all your class hws, quizzes/tests, projects all on a google sheet and sort them by assignment date, due date, time. Also keep a yearly planner to be on top of schoolwork!",

Follow clubs on social media that interest you. They offer many free foods throughout the year. Free lunch and dinner sometimes \ud83e\udd23 \nFollow @usgbaruch especially. They host bigger events. \n3. Be active in class. Teachers will love you!! Ask to stay in contact with those you like at the end of the semester as well. \n4. Keep an active social life outside of school. I only really made friends this semester at Baruch, but I never felt bad like many people seem to do in this group because I had a social life outside of Baruch already. I\u2019m graduating the following semester and I could say I am friends with a few people that I could call friends. \n5. Form a group chat that is how I ended up increasing the number of friends I had at Baruch. I kept them together and try to plan things together, so it is easier for me with my limited time to meet colleagues. My most active groupchat is an art one, where we go to places to enjoy our art discounts as CUNY student. **This a great option if club hours don\u2019t work for you!!! \n6. Apply to opportunity only open for Baruch and CUNY students. \n\nYou will have a great time. You already seem proactive not like many in this group that only complain.....\nI bet many of them are the same one that don\u2019t say a word in class.",

You don't understand the office politics, and you wont for a few months. Work hard, and work well. Dont be annoying. DO NOT talk about your race/gender/sexuality, whatever. Nobody cares, and those topics dont belong in the workplace. Good luck with your new job!",

Starting conversations can be tough at the beginning, but it gets smoother when you make it a regular habit.\n\nEdit:\n\nOne more thing! Get comfortable with people not engaging or liking you for one reason or another. Don\u2019t be a people pleaser (and especially don\u2019t go around asking how you can make them like you) and give your energy to people who can reciprocate and appreciate it. \n\nI\u2019ll rather have a few close friends/acquaintances than 10+ \u201cfriends\u201d who don\u2019t engage with me.",

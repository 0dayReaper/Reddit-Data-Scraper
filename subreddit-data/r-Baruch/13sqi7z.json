The grade was submitted from the other college I took the class in, it still has not been transferred to Baruch into my degreeworks which I\u2019m worried since I\u2019m graduating next Tuesday. I already contacted the office and they said they will review it when final grades are submitted but isn\u2019t that going to be too late? What if my name isn\u2019t on the roster for graduation.",

No idea what the dates where.",

The place I was going to stay this summer from June 10th to August 12th had to pull out for an unexpected reason - looking to find another place to stay for the summer near midtown/Bryant Park(within 25ish minutes by subway) with a preference for studios/single bedroom apartments under 2000 a month(but i\u2019m open to private bedrooms as well). Dm me!\n\n(Original Post)\n\n\nHi! I\u2019m interning in NYC this summer and wanted to see if anyone was subletting their place that I could take over. I\u2019m a guy, looking to take over from June 1st to August 12th ish\u2026 My office is going to be near Times Square, and ideally I don\u2019t wanna be too far from the office or from that part of the city. \n\nWe can talk rent prices and more in DMs so please reach out if you have something that could be useful. My approx budget is 2000 a month on the high side.\n\nFeel free to reddit msg me, just indicate that you\u2019re messaging about housing in NYC so I know where you are dming from. Thanks!!",

You will have to call with your particular schedule as they usually lease per semester but they might accommodate you as they should have rooms available. \n\nhttps://www.studenthousing.org/",

    "postText": "What classes have you guys took during the winter session? How was the workload? Curious bc I'm looking to take winter courses for winter 2024 and the period is only 3 weeks long. Also, was it worth taking classes in the winter for you on all levels (academically, financially, mentally, etc.)?\n\nThank you",

            "comment": "Academically= worth it bc I got an A in 3 weeks for a class that would\u2019ve taken me 16 weeks to finish during a regular semester. Also, another plus is that since it\u2019s a shorter period professors tend to give less work compared to regular semesters.\n\nMentally= It was a easy minor class so it didn\u2019t take a huge toll on me.\n\nFinancially= Not worth it. I had to pay 1k for one class. If you receive financial aid then I recommend taking the class during the summer session 1(5 weeks) because that way you\u2019ll get some type of aid instead of paying everything in full.",

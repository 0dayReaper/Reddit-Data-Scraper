            "comment": "I graduated in Fall 2020 after switching majors from Finance to Entrepreneurship. I loved the program but Id be lying if I said it helped me get a job. But it's entrepreneurship... so that sorta makes sense?\n\nThe professors were great and I was very interested in paying attention to what they had to say. Prof. Holley and Milton were probably my favorites, but there were a handful of other male professors that I couldn't recall or find on the directory. There were a few rough ones of course, but overall pretty solid. I didn't love Prof. Loomba (he who has the department named after him) but he basically gave out high grades if you had good attendance. Had him for Service Operations Management.\n\nYou'll take a variety of business courses. Management, Family Business, Small Business Management/Startups, Communications and Marketing were the main ones. All intro courses basically. When I was in the program, they provided a list of applicable courses and I was able to choose 3-4 of them. I believe I ended up choosing Law, Internet Marketing, and International Business. All informative and reasonable workload. \n\nThe major gave me a well-rounded knowledge of business and I'm happy for that. As someone who struggled with the finance major, I felt like I found my home when I switched.",

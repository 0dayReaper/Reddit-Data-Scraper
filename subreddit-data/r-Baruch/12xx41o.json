    "postText": " Hey there, fellow Bearcat!\n\nAs the excitement around our commencement ceremony grows, we want to remind everyone that the tickets for the event are absolutely FREE. We have noticed some individuals attempting to resell or buy tickets for the ceremony, and we want to clarify that this is strictly prohibited.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 Reselling or buying commencement tickets is NOT allowed. \ud83d\udea8\n\nThese tickets have been provided at no cost to our students as a celebration of their achievements. To ensure that everyone has a fair chance to attend the ceremony, we ask that you do not engage in any activities involving the sale or purchase of these tickets.\n\nHowever, we understand that plans can change, and some students may no longer need their tickets. If this is the case for you, we encourage you to give your ticket(s) away to fellow students who might not have been able to secure one.\n\nIf you're in need of more information about the commencement ceremony, including ticket distribution, dates, and times, please visit the official commencement website: [**https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/studentlife/commencement/**](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/studentlife/commencement/)\n\nWe're all in this together, and we want to ensure a smooth, memorable, and fair commencement experience for everyone. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Let's celebrate our achievements together and make this event one to remember!",

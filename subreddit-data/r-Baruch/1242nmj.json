She\u2019s a very easy A but it is in person.",

The class is easy but AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS. She\u2019s very kind but the tests will destroy your gpa. And she\u2019s a harsh grader on top of that.",

            "comment": "Elisabeth Gareis sucks. She's overcomplicated discussion board posts to the max expecting 4 responses (atleast 150 words each) every week with an extremely strict grading policy and wants you to treat blackboard like it's god damn facebook w creating profile pages and stuff. \n\nI suggest Rianne Subijanto, she's in person and gives discussion boards every week too (3 responses each week) but isn't an asshat like gareis. Do them= get a 100. She young and her class is extremely entertaining ngl.\n\nfor COM4906 I'm taking Richard Wilkins who's literally a boomer. bro doesn't know how to work an email account at all and assigns useless writing assignments which he never grades. But his class was fairly simple, Research topic, presentation, and final 20pg paper. decent professor at baruch imo compared to what we have to deal w.",

Easy ass paper at the end bc the information is literally given to you and you just have to organize it in paragraph form.",

Instead we had a 2 min presentation which was easy because it's literally just 2 minutes, and it wasn't live we just had to record and post.",

Assuming that the presentation you\u2019re talking about is for the ethnographic project on RMP, did you get to pick the person to work with or was it randomly selected? Did you have to read the textbook for discussion posts? For the 4 posts, was it 1 post in response to the prompts and then the 3 other posts were responses to other people? Seems that there are 3 between Monday and Thursday, so did you have to spread out the 3 posts across 3 days or could you just post all 3 posts in one day? Sorry for asking several questions at once, thank you in advance",

She pairs people up and tries to make the matches culturally different from each other. If your partner is unresponsive/uncooperative, you can email her and she'll either pair you with another person or give an alternative assignment. Idk what the alternative assignment is though cause my partner was fine. For the presentation, you can have one person speak but the other has to do something like visuals or making the slides. Or you can split up the time speaking.  \nAs for the discussion posts, you technically *should* read the textbook since the questions are derived from stuff in the textbook. But if you don\u2019t want to you can just command f and find the exact part that the question is referring to. The questions are made by other classmates so they\u2019re generally not that hard. Also, it\u2019s 3 questions each week. You answer each of the questions in a separate db post and then the fourth post is replying to a classmate. You can post the first three posts all in one day as long as it\u2019s between Monday and Thursday, and then the last one just needs to be after Thursday but before the next Monday. The class is very organized/structured even though it sounds kind of complex at first but you get used to the routine pretty quickly and then it\u2019s just super easy. If you just follow the directions you get a 100 on everything.",

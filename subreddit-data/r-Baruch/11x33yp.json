            "comment": "I took him last semester and I actually really like him. He's definitely not the greatest lecturer ever and often goes off-topic, which can be annoying sometimes. The class was pretty easy though and consisted of a lot of the same material from 3500 and 3550. If you take him I'd suggest you participate and turn your camera on if it's an online session.\n\nIf I remember correctly the course consisted of:\n\n\\-Online labs through Infoseclearning.com (12 or 13 of them)- very easy to complete\n\n\\-Midterm Exam (all MC and T/F)\n\n\\-Final Exam (all MC and TF)\n\n\\-Final Research Paper and Presentation- you choose the topic, 8-10 pg paper, 5min presentation, you have most of the semester to work on it\n\nHe also took us on a tour of CUNY's data center in an off-site class session, which was pretty cool and one of the more interesting things I've done at Baruch",

Other than that, no one (and from what u/Living_Leading79797 said, especially not Sockovic) can match the teaching propensity and seductiveness of Harry Davis.",

Harry Davis is awesome. Anyway, Zeljko tries to teach, but unless you practice the homework a LOT, you will not do well. Know the concepts, practice the homework, practice his review problems, and practice exams, and then you can do well. And go to tutoring and the workshop they do every week (which helped me a lot). Unlike Harry Davis, the exams don't match the homework, so expect a hard exam. It will match the review exams a little more but overall might be pretty different.",

When I had covid he didn't even extend the homework if I wouldn't take 50% off the grade. He was not very accommodating too I had a fever and I was still doing homework b/c he wouldn't extend it. He said covid does not count as for extension even if i show him a doctor letter.\n\nExam, its all on you he does review but was not very helpful to me. And you need to do the question over and over again. Just to drill the steps down and what to do in each situation.  \n\n\nOn Rmp he writes his own reviews. So some of them I wouldn't trust it.",

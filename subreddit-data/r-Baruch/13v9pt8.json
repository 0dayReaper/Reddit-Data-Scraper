    "postText": "Here is my fall 2023 schedule:\n\nENG 4710 Medieval Romance Christina Christoforatou Konstantinis\n\nENG 3010 English Lit I Steven Swarbrick\n\nHIS 3456 American Intellectual History Johanna Fernandez  --- I was also thinking about doing POL 3364 Latin American/Caribbean Political Systems Ian Kaufman \n\nPOL 3336 Modern Political Theory Eli Karetny \n\nANT/SOC 3137 Sociology of Health and Illness Robin Root\n\nIdk how I should balance this schedule because I do want to take challenging courses but also maintain my GPA. Idk if I should do a mix of easy and hard courses. Which courses seems a bit extraneous? For myself, Idk how much i would learn something new in american intellectual history so Ithat's why I have also considered POL 3364. Although I have checked rate my professors, I would like to know from people's personal experience, which one is better? Are there any better SOC/ANT courses available in fall 2023 semester?\n\nI need to have 3 eng courses unless I take one in the summer which I am considering. I also like to have courses that connect through theme so I am learning similar things from different vantage points of those fields. I have also though of switching up the eng courses to ENG 3025 AMerican Lit II and ENG 3036 Post-colonial. Could I still do a mix of one of these courses with the abovementioned ENG courses?",

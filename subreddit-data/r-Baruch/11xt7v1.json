    "postText": "I'm in a bit of a pickle. I have to take all 3 fin 4000 level classes this summer to graduate on time. Fin 4610/4710 and the two other Fin 4000 level courses. My question is if I take both Fin 4610 and 4710, will one of them count toward the other two Fin 4000 courses. I am taking Fin 4910 as well, so I'm hoping this will work to fill this requirement, as no other Fin 4000 level courses are being offered this semester. Thanks!",

I had a good experience with her, exams are extremely hard but as long as you participate she\u2019ll curve \n\nFor 4610 - Theodor Hanan Eytan (I think he also teaches in the summer) Do not recommend at all! Avoid him at all costs \n\nFor 4775 - Dan Russo but he does not teach during the summer",

Unfortunately I\u2019m a grad student so I have no impact, but god damn, they get like 20k to spend for students and the students in the sga do nothing. Bruh, do u know how weird it is when you have to walk around to find a seat to eat, and your sitting next to strangers all the time? I really need the secret spot where I can eat.",

The history at Baruch isn\u2019t that great of a program, class subject variety isn\u2019t the best and the professors are hit or miss in terms of lecture quality but the major is fundamental and so it exists. Some things I noticed over the last few semesters here: it is department policy to assign a minimum of three books to buy for the class, essays and exams are mandatory in the courses, the full time professors are considerably more difficult/strict/demanding than the adjuncts. The major isn\u2019t hard, but you will be sitting through classes which are not engaging wondering why you\u2019re doing this major, hence do a second major or minors to keep things interesting. Many of the students in your courses will also be business students, aside from a few other history students you\u2019ll notice. No too much variety of ideology among the professors either, yet you will hear more politics from them than the polisci professors. Happy to share more if needed.",

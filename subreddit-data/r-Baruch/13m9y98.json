The 'deadline submission' is just a rough guideline and theres no penalty for professors giving grades back late. The best you can do is email the chair and kindly tell the chair to tell your professor to speed up the grading process.",

It happens all the time, and don't expect your grades for each assignment to be posted on Blackboard. Some professors just don't post it there and will only post your final grade on CUNYfirst, eventually.\n\nAlso, it's finals season, so some professors will take longer to reply. Based on personal experience, I'd recommend following up in a few days if your professor doesn't answer.",

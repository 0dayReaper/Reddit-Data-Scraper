            "comment": "Had Babak Somekh last semester for ECO 1002 and I would say that he\u2019s a good professor. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to do this next semester but what he did was allow students to join the class on Zoom when the lecture was being held in person so you had the option to join online or attend the class on campus. The grading policy is: HW (on connect and you have two tries for each assignment)- 20%, Quizzes (he drops the lowest one)- 40% and Final- 40%. He does curve the final grade based on your attendance.",

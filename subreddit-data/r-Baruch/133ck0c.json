So I searched through this subreddit and I decided on PAF 1250 Citizenship and Public Affairs with Marco DeSena.\n\nThe subject is really easy, it\u2019s just basic US history, literally everything you learned throughout grade school. One 10 question quiz a week based off weekly short readings. I don\u2019t actually read them, I just use the find function and search for the answer on the pages. \n\nThere is a 30 question test every 4-6 weeks that is based in the readings and prerecorded lectures. I haven\u2019t watched a single lecture either, just look through the readings and use quizlet. \n\nThis class is asynchronous so I literally spend less than 20 minutes a week. But if you have questions he does hangout on a zoom call during class time. It\u2019s literally the easiest and least time consuming class ever. It\u2019s great.",

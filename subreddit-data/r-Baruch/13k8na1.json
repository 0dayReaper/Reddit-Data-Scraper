I could not bring this up during orientation since I had a block on my account and thus could not create the schedule. \n\n  \nDid the BOSS thing, and the lady was super rude and was no help at all\u2014any way to schedule a different appointment? Please, any help is required!",

There could be a possibility of the credits transferring over and it showing up on DegreeWorks but not showing up on your transcript. I took microeconomics through College Now in high school and although on DegreeWorks it said that my credits transferred over, it apparently wasn\u2019t on my transcript which is why I wasn\u2019t allowed to enroll into classes for next semester until this was fixed which only really took a few minutes.",

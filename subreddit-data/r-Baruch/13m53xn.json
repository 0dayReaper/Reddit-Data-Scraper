Any advice based on the teachers and subject ?\n\n\nI want to drop MSC for LAW for the second half of the semester. I am planning on taking MSC for the fall semester, Im just not sure about 3, 3 and 1/2 hour law classes a week is gonna be. Anyone whose taken this class over the summer let me know how it is. Thank you !",

If you can only take the ethics course in the summer, then yes this your best option, but if you want to really engage with the material and leave the course with something then you\u2019d take it in person in the fall or spring.",

This class has a tendency to attract the \"is there class today?\" \"When is this due?\" Types of people. He lists every single due date on the syllabus and his course load is super easy. He's also very understanding. \n\nI also took Benjamin Adam for sociology and he has a different method of teaching the class that doesn't require homework. It's creative and easy to keep up. \n\n\nAlso, good job on securing a fully online schedule. That takes coordination and skills!",

Opened in 2001, the Vertical Campus replaced the Lawrence and Eris Field Building at 17 Lexington Avenue as the primary home for Baruch\u2019s academic and extracurricular activities. For more than 70 years Baruch College was largely restricted from expansion due to the confines of the Field Building at the intersection of 23rd Street and Lexington Avenue and the structure remains nuisance of Baruch College students to this day. As 17 Lex currently undergoes the largest renovation project in its history, it should be pointed out that there is a forgotten chapter in the history of Baruch College, one that would have entirely changed campus life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur story begins in 1967 at Long Island University. In August of that year, CUNY entered into negotiations with LIU to purchase their Brooklyn Center Campus at the corner of Dekalb Avenue and Flatbush Avenue. The sale to CUNY would have included the old Brooklyn Paramount Theater, which LIU had converted into a gymnasium, a 16-story dormitory, a 3-story classroom building, three 15-story apartment buildings owned by LIU, and an under-construction 8-story social sciences hall nearing completion. One month later, the CUNY executive board released a report recommending the relocation of Baruch College to downtown Brooklyn, with the LIU campus being the ideal landing spot for the school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Newsday 9\\/28\\/1967](https://preview.redd.it/mhnlyeh6uld41.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=234b005f84a33d2ce7433aacef84e257e9c77c0f)\n\nThe proposed sale of Brooklyn Center was not made without pushback. Immediately after LIU announced their intentions, students, faculty, community groups, and local pols made their opposition to the sale loud and clear though organized rallies and protests, a lawsuit from the LIU Board of Trustees, and a probe initialed by the New York State legislature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[NY Times 10\\/4\\/1967](https://preview.redd.it/7sphwcabuld41.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=24c91ef171b4ac8770bcc5c08d483b3ac719e8c3)\n\nDespite this, The Board of Regents approved the 32-million-dollar sale of LIU\u2019s Brooklyn Center to CUNY on February 23rd, 1968. There was still a significant amount of bureaucratic red tape before the move became a reality, but it appeared CUNY had made the first step towards getting Baruch a new home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[NY Times 2\\/24\\/1968](https://preview.redd.it/fsj2jj3huld41.png?width=467&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a9500115ebb2fc780d42e0bd0d350c99d23262da)\n\nFollowing the sale\u2019s approval, a new wave of outrage erupted. One week after the announcement, hundreds of LIU students marched across the Brooklyn Bridge in the rain to city hall, urging New York City Mayor John Lindsey to block the sale. However, there was a hidden political dimension to this issue.\n\nFor years, the downtown Brooklyn area had been a target for development by the City and other parties. Most famous of these attempts was a 1950s proposal by Brooklyn Dodgers owner Walter O\u2019Malley, who wanted to build a domed baseball stadium as the new home for his team. His plan was thwarted by New York City Planner Robert Moses who wanted to construct a stadium in the Flushing section of Queens instead. Moses got his Flushing stadium, but not until after O\u2019Malley moved his Dodgers to Los Angeles. The lack of progress in the neighborhood was also one of the motivations behind LIU\u2019s decision to leave Brooklyn. For Mayor Lindsey, Baruch College had the potential to be the cornerstone for an ambitious urban renewal project.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The never-built home of the Brooklyn Dodgers](https://preview.redd.it/o49uyw7puld41.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0fbdc0f6f5db7a34d9fdd20a0fb0f5d7392c546f)\n\nOn April 16th, 1968, Mayor Lindsay made headlines after announcing his opposition to the sale, stating that LIU\u2019s Brooklyn Center served \u201ca unique service\u201d to students and community of downtown Brooklyn. Three weeks later, the sale was rejected by the city\u2019s Board of Higher Education.\n\nWith the planned move dead in the water, it appeared that the chance of Baruch making it to Brooklyn was fading. However, there is more to this story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[NY Times 6\\/24\\/1968](https://preview.redd.it/29hmozvmxld41.png?width=261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5f4bc417ad308fb24565068ed2531a34cb53af45)\n\nOne month after the demise of the LIU sale, the City Planning Commission approved a plan that was set to completely revitalize the downtown Brooklyn area. The 250-million-dollar plan included the creation of new community facilities, parks, 2,400 new low- and middle-income housing units, and finally the construction of a new 97-million-dollar campus for Baruch College along Atlantic Avenue. The entirety of the work would be done within the Atlantic Terminal Urban Renewal Area (ATURA), which encompassed a triangular shaped plot between Flatbush Avenue, Vanderbilt Avenue, and Greene Avenue. With construction set to begin in 1971, Baruch\u2019s Brooklyn Campus was not far away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[NY Times 10\\/31\\/1971](https://preview.redd.it/4jh88y2ayld41.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=388610276a384c754dc6d7ae028fb4c6285c7dee)\n\nBut by 1972, construction had yet to start. Because of the planned location of the campus, realignment of the Long Island Railroad tracks beneath Atlantic Avenue would be necessary and the MTA was unwilling to pay any of the 27 million needed for trackwork. With this high price tag, The Board of Higher Education rescinded its Atlantic Avenue plan in January of 1972 and it once again seemed that Baruch College was back at square one in its journey for a campus in Brooklyn. However, the following year the rumor mill would begin again as CUNY once again sought a new campus for the business school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[NY Daily News \\(12\\/15\\/1973\\)](https://preview.redd.it/srhhymp3vld41.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5f899afff12ff7fbb0b37cebaa5eba0292e69fe6)\n\nIn early 1973, Mayor John Lindsey once again expressed the desire to move Baruch to the ATURA. Under a revised plan, instead of being built above the LIRR tracks along Atlantic Avenue, the campus would instead be situated across the street on the northeast corner of Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue, in turn sparing CUNY the additional 27 million dollars that doomed the original plan.\n\nThis new plan was met with dissent, surprisingly from within Baruch itself. Instead of moving across the East River to Brooklyn, many officials within Baruch sought to move to downtown Manhattan to a vacant skyscraper located along the riverfront. The 40-story skyscraper, 2 New York Plaza, had been completed just a few years prior during New York City\u2019s skyscraper boom of the 1960s, but had sat mostly empty during its short existence. The building\u2019s location right on the edge of the financial district would have put students within close proximity of New York\u2019s premier financial institutions and added to the convenience of faculty, many of whom worked in and around Wall Street. That November, CUNY Chancellor Robert J. Kibbee announced his support for the purchase of 2 New York Plaza citing the 65-million-dollar price tag for retrofitting the building and the ability to move in relatively soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[NY Times 11\\/24\\/1973](https://preview.redd.it/iesv0iyuwld41.png?width=421&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=63256c3baaf98acc137d8935c6d5d3d4d3e12e8c)\n\nAnd as with the previous plans, politics would ultimately decide the fate of Baruch\u2019s new campus. Upon Chancellor Kibbee\u2019s request to the Board of Regents to modify the master plan and allow Baruch to move downtown, local politicians from across Brooklyn came out advocating for Baruch to honor their decision to move to ATURA. Soon, newly elected Mayor Abraham Beame threw his support behind \u201cBaruch to Brooklyn.\u201d Also in opposition of a potential downtown move was NYU and Pace University, both of whom did not want any more higher education institutions entering their downtown territory.\n\nThus, in December 1973 the State Board of Regents rejected Baruch\u2019s request to shift to downtown Manhattan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zvtx5fjxld41.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3f4a1d0e6775d7bd47de30d7943699e51e1b76e1\n\nIt would take yet another year for a substantial development in Baruch\u2019s search for a new campus. In December 1974, The Board of Higher Education approved the modified ATRUA plan to build a 73-million-dollar, 15-acre campus in downtown Brooklyn with an expected completion in 1980.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[NY Daily News \\(12\\/14\\/1974\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ubhhenybvld41.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=af602771bfbcd2b48a6fe53c0fabfc56c8297249)\n\nOf course, the project never got off the ground.\n\nIn 1975, New York City found itself in the midst of the worst fiscal crisis in its history. This crisis inevitably affected CUNY. With proposals to cut staff, raise tuition, and downsize its institutions, the Baruch to Brooklyn plan was put on the shelf yet again, this time for good.\n\nFor the next few decades, Baruch students were forced to contend with outdated facilities and overcrowding at 17 Lex, with the school forced to lease out space in commercial buildings around Manhattan to remedy these issues.\n\nIn downtown Brooklyn, soon after their anticipated sale with CUNY fell through, LIU changed direction and decided to hold on to the Brooklyn Center campus and it remains home to the LIU Brooklyn unit to this day.\n\nAt the former site of ATURA, much has changed since the days of \u201cBaruch to Brooklyn.\u201d Despite a new series of plans arising in the 1980s, the Atlantic Terminal area would remain largely undeveloped until the turn of the century. The final site that was approved for Baruch in 1974 is now home to the Atlantic Terminal Mall which opened in 2004. Finally, across the street at the site of the original 1968 campus plan, now stands the home of the NBA\u2019s Brooklyn Nets: Barclays Center.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ATURA Today.](https://preview.redd.it/ywzl58qwvld41.png?width=1112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=589961e00b519cd40c9d8854f2c18c4af83b8c3f)\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be until 2001 when Baruch finally got its new home, 34 years after Baruch made its first steps for a new campus. The site was not across the river or in downtown, but one block away on the corner of 24th Street and Lexington Avenue.\n\nLooking back, Baruch\u2019s relocation died at the hands of politics and money and Baruch College students suffered as a result. The effects can still be felt to this day. Renovations at 17 Lex, which should have been completed long ago, are just now in essence getting under way, with completion potentially decades away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[NY Times 1\\/15\\/1975](https://preview.redd.it/jecduqdowld41.png?width=1007&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e7eac324ac61c1a1a9e98b3babf5bf4636d0d659)\n\nSo, the next time you\u2019re wait on line for a working elevator at 17 Lex, or march single-file down the sidewalk between 23rd and 24th street to the NVC, just wonder how different the campus experience would be had Baruch made it to Kings County.",

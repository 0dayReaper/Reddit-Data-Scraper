As a matter of fact, for these classes, it doesn't matter who you take, all the professors are doing the same thing.  \n\nAs you take higher level classes, the material may get more technical (depends on your major) and the professor should elaborate more on the concepts rather than reading off the slides.  \n\nEnjoy the easy classes while they last before you get stuck in the difficult ones!",

I scraped all the teacher evaluation data and am hosting it in a way I feel makes it actionable.\n\n[https://professort.tech/](https://professort.tech/)\n\nI hope it can help some people, and I would love some feedback! There is a form on the website for that.\n\nThanks!",

If I was going to use ur app to pick a professor then i would check how the professors performed recently in 2019. Sowing me result for 2017 &amp; 2018 isn\u2019t too helpful. Again, it\u2019s just a friendly suggestion/opinion.",

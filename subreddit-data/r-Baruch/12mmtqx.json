Tbh I\u2019d do it if you get an extra stole or cord to wear at graduation or something. Is anyone in it or know anything about it ?",

I\u2019m gonna pay for $75 it cause it is lifetime membership fee. I think it is worth to pay it but everyone have different thoughts, it\u2019s up to you. Good luck",

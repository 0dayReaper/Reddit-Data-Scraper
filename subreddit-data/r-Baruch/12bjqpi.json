There is a check-in list and journal entry, but he doesn't give it most of the time, but when he starts a new lesson. Midterm was online for me and open book, but not sure how the final would be as he hasn't started on how it would be. The work is not overwhelming since it was open book. Overall, he is an amazing and passionate professor to have while teaching ecology.",

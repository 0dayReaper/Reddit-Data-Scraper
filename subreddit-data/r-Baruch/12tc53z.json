            "comment": "Most likely, in order to become a data scientist, you\u2019ll need to go to grad school. There\u2019s a lot of competition surrounding this field just like with every other tech field.  Some people can get into data science with an undergrad degree but that\u2019s usually if you go to a top school and Baruch is not a top school for tech/data science. If you want to give yourself a better chance, maybe major in SQM and minor in math. The better alternative would be to just major in statistics (BA) and minor in comp sci. SQM just touches on the basics of statistics and there is no calc requirement if you don\u2019t do math minor. The statistics route would be much tougher because you would have to go the calc 1-3, linear algebra, and probability route, along with many other advanced statistics classes. Taking all of these classes will make you a good candidate when applying for grad school. Arguably, majoring in statistics would also give you more of an advantage than being an SQM major if you were applying to internships in undergrad. Now, with both statistics and SQM, you\u2019ll learn R and SQL, but as a stats major, if you do the comp sci minor, you\u2019ll have even more programming knowledge, especially with data structures and algorithms. In summary: Statistics major (BA) with comp sci minor &gt; SQM major with math minor &gt; CIS major with data analytics concentration and comp sci or math minor.",

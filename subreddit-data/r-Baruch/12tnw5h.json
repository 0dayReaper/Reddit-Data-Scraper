    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m currently a sophomore at Baruch\n \nI\u2019m having a hard time deciding whether I should drop a course where my professor is assuring me that I will receive an F. I\u2019m currently a full-time student with 12 credits this semester, If I drop this course, I\u2019ll become a part time student with 9 credits which I understand will affect my financial aid in a significant way.\n \nDo any of you mind telling me what are the consequences on my financial aid if I decide to drop this course as of this moment of the semester?",

First try that route instead of dropping the class.\n\nProfessors love students who take accountability (from what I've experienced), send the professor an email, don't blame anyone just ask if there is absolutely anything you can do to make up your grade and that your financial aid is in jeopardy which ultimately puts your future at jeopardy. Explain this to the Professor, they may work something out with you. \n\nI know you haven't taken the final exam yet. Why not try your absolute best to get a 100 on the exam? Could that pick up your grade enough to get you to pass? \n\nDon't withdraw just yet before you explore all your options. It isn't worth it to lose financial aid.",

However, you are downgrading to a part time student, less than 12 credits, which means your fee model now goes from one flat rate, to a per credit basis. In this case, it's $305 per credit if you're in-state, 305*9 is $2745. This $2745 will be your tuition cost for this semester. However, downgrading to a part time student will change how fin aid is calculated, but that I don't know the specifics. That you will have to go to fin aid office to sort out.",

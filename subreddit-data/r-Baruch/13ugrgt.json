    "postText": "I'm thinking about getting a Master degree, and Baruch still seems like a fine option.\n\nI'm too broke for out-of-state tuition.\n\nMy gpa is probably too low for Stern and Columbia (3.4 est.). I'm still going to apply for it anyways. \n\nI realize these private schools are more expensive than some public schools even with out-of-state tuition, but considering the cost of relocating and the headaches with it, I would  rather stay in the city.\n\nI just finished my junior year(Zicklin, Finance Major, Economic Minor), and haven't take GRE yet, will prep it during the summer.\n\nFor anyone who is in Baruch for grad, how is the program, and when did you guys start your application process.\n\nThanks for any advice in advance",

    "postText": "I\u2019m planning to graduate in this summer and registered 2 classes (those are the only left to satisfied all the requirements). On my degree works, the credit circle indicates 100%, but requirement circle indicates 97%. Is this because I am still in the process of the spring semester and I have to have 2 more classes done in the summer? I\u2019m super anxious about this graduating stuff because I can\u2019t mess it up\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

So I believe the number of credits sound about right ( the credit circle also indicates 100% as of now), but as you mentioned, many people have gotten screwed by it, I just wanted to make sure with someone\u2026.",

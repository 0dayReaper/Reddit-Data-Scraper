Is there anyone I can contact at this moment to ask about this concern, since technical support hours are over, or am I screwed?",

If you absolutely can\u2019t take it today i believe they just reschedule you if not contact the undergraduate email and see what they can do. And the test itself is on blackboard, I don\u2019t really remember where it\u2019s located exactly though",

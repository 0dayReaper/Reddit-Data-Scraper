    "postText": "As the title suggests it feels like baruch treats alums as strangers when visiting the school. This is specifically a security problem, I don\u2019t understand why the security can\u2019t just let you write your name and give a security pass. Other cuny schools that I visited have done that and I wasn\u2019t even a student at those schools. Yesterday I visited and the security in the front seem to have an issue because I wanted to visit one of my professors and friends on campus.",

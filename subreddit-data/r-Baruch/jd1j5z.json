However, with classes online this semester, professors have been overloading us with work to compensate for the fact they\u2019re online. I\u2019ve barely been sleeping because I can\u2019t keep up with the sheer amount of work they\u2019re piling on us. \n\nI\u2019m not even doing well and I\u2019m this close to having a mental breakdown and dropping all of my classes. \n\nI hate that my professors don\u2019t care \u2014 I hate that they think I have a lot of time on my hands because I\u2019m home.",

The amount of work is tripled if not more compared to the last term. No Pass fail this semester and what sucks, even more, I think we are gonna be online for at least another year.",

Now I\u2019m stuck in my house and the best thing I can get is a discord group chat but it\u2019s just not the same. I really hate this semester. A lot of valuable knowledge could\u2019ve been learned, all I\u2019m seeing is people submitting assignments for grades nothing more. I might take a gap semester in hopes of Fall 2021 being in person if not idk what I\u2019m gonna do. It\u2019s honestly been a struggle, idk how you guys can go about this way. \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14",

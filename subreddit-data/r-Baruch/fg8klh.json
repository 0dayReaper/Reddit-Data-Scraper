He instead, taught it *his* way. The class was difficult, and the company even sent representatives to tell them how they were going to essentially fail without the program. Well, after exams and homeworks, the class average was an A; whereas other classes, who used the Pearson program, had at best a C average.\n\nIn short: literal scam and a half and no better than a hustler.",

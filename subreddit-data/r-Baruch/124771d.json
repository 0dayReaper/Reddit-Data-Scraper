            "comment": "I did all 3 in one semester + 3 more classes. It really depends on professor and how much work they give, and on the way you design your schedule. If you go to class 2 times a week (Monday &amp; Wednesday) from morning to night (yes it\u2019s tiring), look how much time you have now to study and relax. If you go everyday with 1-2 a day it now gets stressful since you have to study in between. Then accounting 2101 is asynchronous so you don\u2019t have to attend class at a specific time, so once you get free you knock that off. Cis 2200 is just memorization if I understand and stats is decently hard but manageable. I went straight into qnt2020 which I think is easier if you have a good prof",

Who is a better choice? I'm trying to improve my GPA, so I really don't want to end up doing badly in any classes. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Someone on our team has both of them currently. Says that Malca is a more conceptual class that is laid back. He doesn\u2019t curve and most of your grade is tests. Zhang is a more quantitative class, however attendance and homework account for 30% of your grade, plus she curves heavily.\nIt really depends on your learnings style",

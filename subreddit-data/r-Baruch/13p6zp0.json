I don\u2019t give a rats ass about who\u2019s saying what. Gimme one Oprah like speaker and start calling names! Kingsborough had a great ceremony last year, we had a few speakers but we each got our moment when they called our names, played relevant, hype music, and let us enjoy the moment, it\u2019s OUR moment!",

I would have settled for them asking the students from the different schools to stand and wave at their friends and family or even a walk in and exit procession. There has to be a middle ground.",

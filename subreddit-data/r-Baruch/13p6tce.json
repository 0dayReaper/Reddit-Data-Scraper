Everyone saying the social scene is dead in this Reddit be lying through their teeth, trust me you\u2019re gonna see large friend groups everywhere you go and it\u2019s incredibly loud and it\u2019s easy to make friends, though there are a lot of toxic adults with a high school mentality, so I can get why people think it\u2019s hard to make genuine friends who will stay in the long-run. Good luck",

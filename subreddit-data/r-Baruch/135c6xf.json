Baruch didn\u2019t even help me with job search or anything like that. I\u2019m glad I put myself out there to at least get internships and whatnot to have experience because if I didn\u2019t I wouldve legit been so much more sadder as a senior. I always knew from freshmen year I would regret coming here since it\u2019s commuter. Hopefully in the future I can save up enough to let my kids go to a nice school",

Seems way to dramatic but events shown that greatly. And my work ethic improved coming to Baruch.

            "comment": "Personally, I find CUNY's environment to be quite upsetting.  Many CUNY students don't seem to be happy with their lives, especially those who attend Hunter, the school I'll be attending in the fall. As a commuter school, CUNY's environment makes sense, but I do believe that many students would LOVE to socialize with others if CUNY made the effort. I would frequently witness amazing events that Columbia, NYU, SUNY, and literally any other institution would put on for its students, but nothing like that at a CUNY.   I understand that the majority of students are there to get a degree, but many of them have expressed regret about their time at CUNY because they 1. didn't enjoy the college experience (because there\u2019s literally none) and 2. They don't seem to receive much assistance from advisors... It is also annoying that networking is difficult at CUNY because few individuals are socializing. I still haven't even gone to hunter, but I really, really, really hope that my experience will be different. \n\nBut I also feel disappointed in myself for not putting myself out there. If I'm being completely honest, I feel like I already regret choosing to commit to hunter. I had other options like Binghamton, Stony Brook, Fordham\u2026but I still chose hunter. The fact that my family didn't appear to want me to leave for college meant that they wouldn't have been supportive even if I had chosen a SUNY. Even my father told me I shouldn't apply to Syracuse because he thinks I'll be miserable, but to be honest, living in the city for so long already makes me feel depressed. I try to make myself feel better when I think about grad school and not having to take out loans for undergrad, but peoples comments about hunter is actually making me regret my choice. Now looking at it now, I don\u2019t mind taking out some money for undergrad\u2026at least they seem to have more fun than us\u2026anyways, I\u2019ll try to have a positive mindset, especially since a feeling towards something can affect your experience \ud83d\ude15",

This place is just mean \ud83d\ude02\n\nI\u2019ve been here damn near 4 years and I haven\u2019t had any interactions with advisors \u2026.. at York I almost immediately got in contact with the nicest most helpful advisors. It was a breath of fresh air, it felt like I was right back at BMCC (which was a magical place.) I was pressed to go to Baruch because of the name \u2026. But I wish I would\u2019ve realized that it doesn\u2019t matter where you get your degree. Nobody cares, as long as you can show proof that you have it. \n\nBaruch is such a cold and callous place. The workload is absurd, the professors and staff are terrible, and it\u2019s just not a very social campus. I think out of all the CUNY\u2019s Baruch is the one that really lacks that \u201ccommunity\u201d element. It\u2019s full of the business rejects that just weren\u2019t good enough to get into a better school. \n\nThankfully I\u2019ll be doing my second bachelors at York.

Plus students only want to make friends to cheat off you. I rather have a great college experience than a sad anti social life here.",

However out of 6 exams and 1 final (didn\u2019t make it to the second semesters final) the highest grade I could achieve was somewhere in the 30\u2019s.\nI am so discouraged at this point that I know if I registered for a third time I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. The ability is no longer there.",

My graduation date has already been pushed back a year due to prior difficulties getting the classes I need. I spoke to an advisor about this when enrollment opened and they were no help, told me there was nothing I could do besides wait and see if I get off the waitlist. \n\nAdditionally Ive only been able to get into evening/weekend classes the past two semesters (and seemed like fall 23 semester would be the same). My job is only open nights and weekends so this impacted my work.",

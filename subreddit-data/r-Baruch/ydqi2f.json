    "postText": "Hi all. This really hurts my pride coming on here for this, but due to unfortunate circumstances I think I might become homeless within a couple of weeks and, with the cold weather coming up, I\u2019d really like to avoid that. \n\nIf anyone knows of a place with a quick hiring process I would really appreciate it. I have retail and medical office experience. I have a 3.6 gpa and currently struggling with the job hunt. \n\nThanks for reading.",

            "comment": "Most of these solutions offered here will not prevent you from losing your apartment or home. I currently attend Baruch full time, i am 33, I pay 1850 rent and I do not work. Those offering to get a job hourly aren't clearly aware of what it takes to prevent eviction.\n\n\nStep 1: Go to HRA and apply for the full range of benifits.\n\nhttps://a069-access.nyc.gov/accesshra/\n\n\nStep 2: Create an account.\n\nStep 3: Apply for SNAP, Cash assistance, medicaid and for rental assistance also known as the one shot deal/grant. \n\nStep 4: gather your required documents, food stamp and cash assistance are pretty straight forward. Provide identity documents, income documents (or the lack of income), your lease or a statement from your landlord verifying your residence.\n\nStep 5: You need to get proof of rental arrears. If you have already received paper work from your property management/landlord be sure to provide these documents to the HRA. \n\nStep 6: Over the span of 25 days, monitor your \"e-notice\" category around the clock, the one shot grant team will release updates here and may require more documents. Sometimes the case moves up the ladder and the new agent will want you to submit everything all over again. DO NOT SLACK, SUBMIT EVERYTHING ALL OVER AGAIN.\n\nStep 7: You need to provide a future ability to continue paying your rent, you could provide a job offer letter, or a provide a relative that promises to pay a certain amount towards rent. \n\nStep 7: you'll get a payment notification like this:\n\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/hyDs27B/Screenshot-20221026-160548-Chrome.jpg\n\n\nStep 8: The grant limit for one shot deal is I believe 7500$ and you do not have to pay it back.\n\nStep 9: you made it yay, no more eviction.\n\n\nNow that you are approved for SNAP/CA/Medicaid you can move further down.\n\nGet free high speed internet\n\nApply for the affordable connectivity act:\n\n\nhttps://www.affordableconnectivity.gov/\n\nYour approval is usually instant if you have a Pell grant or SNAP or cash assistance.\n\nOnce you get this code head on over to:\n\n\nhttps://www.verizon.com/home/free-verizon-internet/?cmp=KNC_H_P_COE_GAW_FiOS_99_99_BP-9120&amp;abr=CMOGBRPLUS&amp;c=A005126&amp;kpid=go_cmp-15621458566_adg-132086749595_ad-628072119348_kwd-1646154501518_dev-m_ext-_prd-_sig-Cj0KCQjwteOaBhDuARIsADBqRejSsKcmB3xTJ2Zweu0ovjm17HOFEtKeHpQQbqcOTwneu-kNzwt3k3saAgMXEALw_wcB&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwteOaBhDuARIsADBqRejSsKcmB3xTJ2Zweu0ovjm17HOFEtKeHpQQbqcOTwneu-kNzwt3k3saAgMXEALw_wcB\n\n\nSchedule for a Verizon fios or high speed installation.\n\nOnce install is complete, call Verizon enter your affordable connectivity code and you will now have free 0$ per month high speed internet, this will allow you to stay connected for free to keep your online presence consistent to find employment.\n\n\nIf you are also still in school, once you reach to the bottom of this guide  you can apply for an income adjustment, have your EFC reset to 0 and the Pell grants will flow in giving you the needed cash surplus boost. \n\n\n\nI genuinely wish you the best of luck, and I hope this guide helps you get through it all. Good luck again, Godspeed.\n\n\n\nEdit: forgot to mention, once HRA approves you, you'll get roughly 281$ + 95$ every month for food. That's 376$ per month to buy food. If you live near the hood, some stores let you use SNAP to buy whatever, you can pick up your bounty, bathroom essentials this way without touching your cash. \n\nIf you get approved for CA you will get a bi-weekly allowance for about 200$x2 per month. If you get approved for one shot deal, they usually lower this amount and send monthly checks to your landlord for small amounts. I get 2 checks 107.50$x2 per month sent to my landlord. So my rent is 1850 but with the assistance of these checks  it brings it down to 1635 per month.",

You're better off looking into spring 2024 or fall 2024. If not, then I can't help you.",

Most of the electives abroad are easy to pass.\n\nKeep in mind that depending in what country are you studying, the way that they teach you and evaluate you change which in some cases it can become harder compared to the US.",

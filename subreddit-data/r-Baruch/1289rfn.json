            "comment": "Had Anthea Perkinson earlier this semester and it wasn\u2019t that bad of a class. There\u2019s two quizzes, a midterm and a final. The two quizzes and midterm were online while the final was in person. The main problem everyone had was that the final was worth 50% of the overall grade. But the final ended up being questions from the midterm and both quizzes and she gave extra credit on the final so if you studied the quizzes and midterm, you pretty much got a 90+ on the final.",

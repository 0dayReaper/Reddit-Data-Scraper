    "postText": "Hello,  \n\n\nI'm looking to apply for the MS Quant and Modeling and wanted some opinions. I'm working full-time currently and wanted to see how other have balanced their classes with their work schedule. I'm not in a position to go full-time and I wanted to hear some opinions.   \n\n\nHow is the course work?   \nHow many hours of studying did you see yourself doing?   \nHow many classes did you take?\n\nAre there summer/winter classes available for MS students? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance! I greatly appreciate the insight.",

Because a laptop wasn\u2019t mentioned in the list of perks for DS students. Someone let me know before I order my own pls!!!\n\nTotally missed the rundown of what the honors program entails of  because I couldn\u2019t attend the reception.",

If it's not within your budget, Baruch also loans laptops. \n\nDS will remind you of the requirements to remain in the DS Program throughout the year, in some events/emails/advisor meetings. But it goes something like this: scholarships for tuition, study abroad stipend, priority registration, maintain a 3.2+ GPA (lower than a 3.2 for two total semesters, cumulative, will result in removal from the program). Again they'll just tell you everything early into the semester, so don't worry too much.",

He\u2019s veryyyy lecture heavy, literally spends the entire class time talking, starts exactly on time and ends at the exact ending time. But the exams are easy, multiple choice all based on the slides he posts. There are 2 group projects, in 3270 it was 2, 6 page essays in groups of 3 so each person is in charge of 2 pages basically. In 4910 it\u2019s 1, 6 minute video and 1, 6 page essay. He\u2019s an easy professor, just boring cause he drones on lol.",

                    "comment": "thats good to know but makes no sense if each person is responsible with two pages each since the essay has to make sense together which would be the hard part then just one person doing it or by yourself lol. Luckily his lectures are exactly like his slides he post so its can be easy since its just multiple choice.",

Something that\u2019s worked for me and the groups I was assigned was doing everything in 1 google doc so you can make the essay flow together and have one person do one last look over and put it together. His slides do include a lot of redundant info and there are times the slides just have questions but he answers them in class, but tbh, I zone out in class and do other work and still get 90+ on the tests lmao",

    "postText": "what is the minimum grade needed to pass pre-calc. I honestly don\u2019t know what to do .. i go to tutoring , practice &amp;study ,never missed class and i still can\u2019t manage to grasp some  of the concepts of mth2003. I end up blanking out on tests even though i may know the concept . Even if i manage to pass the final , I don\u2019t know if I can pass the class . I want to be hopeful that i can pass but I also want to plan an alternative for next semester if I don\u2019t because some of the classes i have to take require it as a pre-req. Should I try to take MTH2009? is it easier , do the clep exam , anything ?  I know some people will come here and comment that the class is easy or i\u2019m lazy or whatever it is\u2026 I personally find it difficult so that is why I ask . For reference my major is international marketing :) any advice or help as to what to do or someone who\u2019s been is a similar situation would be helpful :)",

            "comment": "If I\u2019m not mistaken, the only rule for pre calc is that you have to get at least a 50 on your final exam for your exam score to be inputted into your overall grade. If you get less than a 50, you automatically fail the course. If you do get at least a 50 on the final exam, then you would need to get at least a 60 as your overall grade because a 60 is equal to a D which is the lowest passing grade at Baruch. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re allowed to switch MTH 2003 for MTH 2009 when retaking the course so you might want to check in with the department to know for sure. I personally had to retake the course and I chose to take it during the summer instead of in the spring because I wanted to only focus on math instead of being overwhelmed with other classes at the same time. I would recommend watching the video explanations that explains the problems on the practice finals that are provided in the MTH 2003 ALL section of Blackboard. Besides that, something that might help you study/understand the course materials a bit better are the video resources that go into detail of each section of the course. \n\nhttps://www.baruch.cuny.edu/tutorials/CombinedCalculus/",

            "comment": "I think the minimum passing grade is 50 or above towards the final. Even if you did all the hw and exams, the final determines if you pass or fail.\n\nTry practice the finals from previous semester and go to tutoring. Even go to office hours and ask your professor regarding any questions you don\u2019t understand. \n\nMth 2009 is the same as mth 2003, but 2009 with one topic less than 2003 or vise versa. I think. I know that they are similar, but one of the class doesn\u2019t do one more topic compared to the other one.",

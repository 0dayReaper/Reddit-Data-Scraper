They said we could reach out to them for further questions? Do students actually reach out to them to ask questions? What is the etiquette around  asking questions? \nFirst time here . \nHelp me out in this.  ( anything you can think of) \n\nAlso , how did you politely decline one over the other ?",

            "comment": "My advice is to do your own research about the company especially think if one or the other will benefit you the most in the future. Research about the work environment, work satisfaction, their revenue, and information like that. Whenever you decide on which to decline just write them an email to thank them for their time but you\u2019ve decided to not accept their offer at this moment. Keep it short and simple. Best of luck",

    "postText": "Hey, I\u2019m an incoming freshman that mistakenly applied for Econ on the BA track instead of the BBA track. I really want to change it and possibly my major. I know people don\u2019t start taking classes for their actual major until junior year\u2026but I have a lot of dual enrollment credits and want to get started on my pre- reqs early. Do you think they\u2019ll let me change it before the semester begins??",

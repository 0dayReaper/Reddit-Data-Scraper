In MTH 3300 course description mentioned **\" MTH 3300 is not open to students who have completed CIS 3120\"** However, I haven't take the CIS 3120 yet. \n\n# MY question: Can take CIS 3120 next semester? or I can never take that course since I am taking 3300? I am asking it becasue it says \"MTH 3300 not open for those who completed CIS 3120,\" But I haven't completed CIS 3120; so does it mean, If I take MTH 3300 then I will be able to take 3120 in next semester?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will highly appreciate any response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",

If you already took CIS 2300 then you can not also get credit for MTH 3300.\nhttps://baruch-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/courses/1473721\n\nIf you want to minor in CS, you would just need take an additional MTH course in place of MTH 3300.  As per the FAQ here:\n https://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/ASheffer/csminor.html",

If the description of that class states that you need to take CIS first, it better to take it and not to worry about it. But if you take MTH, without CIS, then, I don\u2019t know if you will be drop from that class. I haven\u2019t started on my CIS classes yet. I would prefer to do what the require classes without worrying about being dropped out",

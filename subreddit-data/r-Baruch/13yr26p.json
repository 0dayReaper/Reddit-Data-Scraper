    "postText": "Just curious why Baruch does the BARE MINIMUM when it comes to anything especially commencement ceremony. Every other CUNY literally recognizes each of the student and gives them a chance to go on stage, shake hands and have a moment!!! It only takes 4 hours(whole ceremony) to do so for the SAME AMOUNT OF students as Baruch has. \n\nIsn\u2019t it more beneficial to recognize the students rather than listen to speakers on that day? And it\u2019s perfectly doable in literally 4 hrs!   \n\nMaybe we should do a petition lmao",

It was so aggravating sitting through it. I understand it\u2019s not mandatory to go but it\u2019s such a huge milestone and we deserve for it to be celebrated properly. I had so many friends and family ask for a video of my name being said and were all shocked when I said I don\u2019t have one! \n\nIdgaf if we have a million kids that go to our school. Do separate graduations ceremonies for each school or something then. All CUNYs have a million kids and still do it properly. Instead we had to hear Chuck Schumer come and brag about his political accomplishments instead.",

Baruch\u2019s commencement was in the morning and Hunter was that afternoon. There had to be some cleanup in between and prep for the next group. \n\nFor walking across the stage they have to accommodate students, especially those with disabilities. I know names were called at Brooklyns commencement this year, what I don\u2019t know if there was a specific marching order, but their students had to confirm via a form ahead of time to ensure their name was pronounced correctly. Security and layout also had to considered.\n\nI\u2019d personally stay for the confetti drop as well, but I can\u2019t speak for everyone. With speeches taking up a couple hours of the ceremony, people that have reservations, small children in attendance, or other plans will most likely leave if it goes on too long.",

People also know what time the event ends and then can plan accordingly with their reservations. \nI\u2019m not seeing a valid excuse to deny the walk across the stage. \nI saw there several staff members from various departments helping to direct students and did so with a smile as this is the culmination of a shared effort.

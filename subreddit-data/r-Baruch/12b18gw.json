Then yes. \n\nI wasn\u2019t going to go to my graduation; then, on my very last day of class as an undergrad senior at Baruch, as I was leaving my house that morning, I bumped into my 7th grade English teacher (who lives in my area). Throughout the years we always say hello to one another when we pass each other on the street etc. Nice dude. Anyway, I told him \u201chey today is my last day of college!\u201d And then he asked me when graduation was, and how proud he is of me. I responded with \u201cI\u2019m not going to graduation\u201d. And for the first time ever, he showed negative emotion toward me. He nearly flipped out at me saying \u201cyou have to go to graduation!  I know your parents!  They worked hard for this!  YOU HAVE TO GO!  I know that you\u2019re too cool for it, but you owe it to them. Go, get the cap and gown, and take photos with them. Do it for them and for me\u201d. \n\nThat interaction, at that exact moment, was enough to change my mind. I went to baruch and paid for graduation etc and picked up my cap and gown. \n\nIt\u2019s up to you. But my parents love the pics from that day. I truthfully didn\u2019t care for graduation. It was boring and full of speeches but truthfully it was a nice experience. \n\nYour call.",

Big waste of time imo and you can always get pictures with friends and such elsewhere without having to pay for a cap &amp; gown",

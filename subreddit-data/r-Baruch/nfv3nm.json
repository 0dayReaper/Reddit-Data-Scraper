    "postText": "Finally done with Baruch and will be graduated, so I've decided to compile a list of professors I've had since my time at Baruch. Was a transfer student. Yadda yadda, def can find it on RMP too, but hey, some professors weren't on there. Feel free to add your own!\n\n**SOC1005 - Daniel Sherwood**. 8/10 would take again because the class WAS interesting. Learned a lot about Chicago Heat Wave, something about drag queens. Had to write essays, no exams (if i remember correctly) Had him for a 9AM class so I did want to fall asleep here and there. Had a lot to read for homework, but I mostly highlighted a few things that I can talk about instead of reading the entire thing.\n\n**COM1010 - Beth Seplow**. 10000/10 LOVE HER. I definitely recommend her to everyone who's nervous about public speaking. I think her class changed my life, honestly. She was always very encouraging and gave tons of extra credit to whoever volunteered to go first. I always went either 2nd or 3rd. About 4 speeches, 1 group speech. She asks for outlines, but that's pretty simple. You do what she asks, you will get an A+. I know there were a few people in my class that didn't try and gave up in the middle of a speech - yeah, don't do that!\n\n**HIST1001 - Anna Boozer**. 8/10 I honestly don't remember anything in this class. She was really easy, but she counts attendance and has you seated in a certain seat so she knows who you are. Think her exams were just based off her slides and a couple short answers. Easy class but not memorable!\n\n**CIS2200 - Jarrod Placide-Raymond**. 9/10 and again, I don't remember ANYTHING I learned. I believe this was before the class got into more of an excel-type class? I think they changed it around. But he was so easy and quizzes were on blackboard. I took him for a friday class. Had a group project that I barely contributed to because it was just that easy. SAM assignments are annoying, but that's the schools programming so there's that.\n\n**ART1011 -**  **Maria Del Mar Morosse,** 100000/10 excuse me, literally the easiest class i have EVER had. Exams were based off of pictures. You circle the right choice, that's it. Final was 100 pictures. It sounds really hard to memorize it but...she literally stood there, graded it, told us what we got wrong and...let us circle the correct ones. Had an assignment where you go to the museum, like a \"treasure hunt\"  and you had to find a sculpture, take a photo in front of it, and I believe that was it. SO easy.\n\n**ENG 2800** \\-  **William McClellan.** 7/10 but that's because I found his class to be extremely boring. I love reading, but dammit did I want to skip everyday. We read a few shakespeare books, analyzed it, and wrote 2 or 3 essays on it for our exams. But that's it. Really easy essays as they're stuff we talk about in class. Our homework was just to read. People barely participated so he WILL cold call. Best to read a few pages :)\n\n**COM3800 - Susan Mekrami.** 100000/10 once again. I actually took this class on a whim because I needed an extra class to meet the TAP requirement. BEST CHOICE EVER. This class is the class that made me be a communications minor. Either way, she is super easy and sweet. Our essays (I forgot how many) were so easy because she gave you the directions and then an entire essay example of what she wanted to see. SO easy. SOOOO EASY. Presentation in the end about a company that used public relations to their advantage. Love her. Although...our quizzes were pretty hard. I never knew what she wanted. But still got an A-!\n\n**ACC2101 -  Mingcherng Deng** 7/10 what can I say, I hate accounting. Very good professor. If you study, you will do well. Homework is all on connect and final/midterm exam was in person. Just study. I didn't but still passed. With a C. So theres that\n\n**FIN3000 - Lei Lei** 5/10 but I'm biased because anything that has to do with numbers or math, HATE. He was good but so boring and I paid 0 attention in class. Again, if youre a studious person, you will do well. Got to have a cheat sheet for our midterm exam, which was all multiple choice. Halfway into the semester, we went online. Online, we had homework on connect (As always) and our final was also online. The final, he probably made it harder because he put in around 5 short answer questions. If we didn't have the option of credit/no credit, this class would've plunged my GPA.\n\n**MKT3000 - William Heath**, **Teodora Szabo-Douat** 10/10 Bless Professor Heath, before we went online, he was actually replaced by Teodora for a few days. I hope he is okay and whatnot. He was an old man that never gave any homework or actual work. Just read off a textbook. As for Teodora, we spent a few days in class together but she was really interesting and kind to us. We had about 2 homeworks, real easy. Then we went online and we had a group project, which was to create a product of your own. Easy class overall.\n\n**MGT3120 - Cynthia Thompson** \\- 9/10 REALLY easy professor. She definitely counts attendance, though. You need to sign in. Her homework was on connect and I don't remember much tbh. Just remembered it as an easy class. Had to write journals based off of these personality tests she sent. Then we went online and in lieu of a final exam, she wanted us to write an essay on how we think we changed (based on those journals) Kinda lame tbh I wouldve rather taken a real final\n\n**NMA2050 -**  **Fabian Tabibian** \\- 10/10 He taught me about Photoshop/After effects and I was going to minor in this but I didn't want to take more classes than needed. Sucks we had to pay for Adobe, but having it in my hands made me want to teach myself things he didn't teach me. I would've expected more graphic art making/learning cool photoshop tricks but tbh we just learned how to make a gif and a video. Loves when u participate, he did give us some work, like watching a video or two, but its manageable.\n\n\\[\\[ONLINE EXPERIENCE\\]\\]\n\n**COM 3102**  \\- **Susan Mekrami** \\- Took her over the summer. Same review as the other :)\n\n**MKT3600 - Sheldon Wayman**  \\- 10/10 Took him over the summer when we were online. No homeworks, I think? Either way, really easy shit. Exam based off of slides. What more can you ask for.\n\n**COM4900 - Linda Lopez** \\- 100000000/10 LOVE her. She seems like too much, but honestly...she's a professor I will hold very dear to my heart. She sends a lot of nonsensical articles that I never bothered to open. She had 3 modules, each module she basically gives you a month to do and you just follow her prompts. Be sure to understand her clearly because she tends to go off on a tangent. But, she truly treasures each and every one of her students.\n\n**POL2001** \\-  **Joanna Phua** \\- 10/10 Easy class. Google form based off her slides that she sends, EASY. No classes were held even though we technically shouldve met. EVERYTHING IS BASED OFF HER SLIDES she tells you exactly whats going to be on the quiz/exam. We met once as a group  to talk about an article we were supposed to read, but that's it.\n\n**MGT3121** \\- **Amita Singh** \\- 7/10 Manageable, I don't ever remember taking an exam, although I'm sure we did. I passed and that's that. we were supposed to have a group project but she scrapped that. looking back, i actually remember nothing from this class.\n\n**MKT3605 -**  **Sankar Sen** \\- 8/10 I truly like him because he is so interactive and kind, but man. His exams were tricky. I'd second guess myself a lot and it seemed like the problem for many others as well. Butttttttt, I passed with a B+ so needless to say, was shocked. Exams are based off his slides, of course. Homework? I don't remember any.\n\n**MKT4555 -**  **Karthik Sridhar**  \\- 7/10 He was alright. If I was in person, I would actually learn a lot. Taught me about google ads and things like that. Exams seemed hard but it was alright. Quizzes were on this other site, also super easy. Had 3 group project assignments which were mainly done through google analytics/ads. You'd learn a lot if you paid attention!\n\n**MKT4620 -  Marshall Sponder** \\- 100/10 He was already an online class, so it was easier. He reminds you a week in advance on what is due. Lets you retake quizzes/midterm/final like 2 or 3x. Discussion boards but you just have to read an article and BS it tbh. Really easy A! If you do everything well, he will let you go without taking a final. but I do admit quizzes are tricky!\n\n**MKT4123 - Marshall Sponder** \\- AGAIN\\^\n\n**MKT4557 - Benjamin Guttman** \\- 8/10 I would definitely find his class interesting if I had him in person. Online, i cannot pay attention. He brought in some guest speakers which was pretty cool. He is a Baruch alum so he understands it's a  lot of stress as a student. NEVER responds to emails, however, and had 1 homework assignment that many people got 6-7/10. Had a final group project which was extremely vague imo. Takes forever with grading. But really nice guy that cares about digital marketing.\n\n**MKT4561 - Joshua Mortiz** \\- 7/10 I had to take him because it was the only \"elective\" class available for me and it was so strange that this professor had taught in different colleges before, but I couldnt find a review for him. Sigh. I went in this class thinking I'd get a C at best, but I've been getting 90-100s, which is a surprise. In the beginning, his homeworks took me hours to do because I wasn't familiar with the program he uses (Tableau/RapidMiner). In the end, we kinda cooled off on that and focused a lot more on excel. Had 3 projects and i was extremely blessed with a good team. I know a few people who weren't so lucky. You must make sure to communicate to him that your team sucks if they do! Quizzes were easy if you paid attention. If not, (like me), you can definitely study for a good hour or two and figure things out. Would recommend, just a little boring and way too much work.\n\n**MKT5750 -**  **Diogo Fajardo Nunes Hildebrand** 7/10 Won't lie, he gets on my nerves a bit. We had a midterm and he was about to give us only 30 minutes for 30 questions because of \"policy.\" HOWEVER, his class *felt* easy. The midterm actually wasnt so bad and he ended up giving us 45 minutes for 33 questions. We had a stimulation to do, a few reports, and a case study. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE GREAT TEAM MATES! Case study was worth 35% of the grade, so make sure you proofread and all that good stuff.\n\n**BPL5100 - MaryAnne Holley** \\- 10/10 I think I'd like her more if we were in person. I had her for a 9am class and she ALWAYS wanted to talk. I was like damn. Can we not do this so early? But just humor her and respond back and she will love you. She def checks to see if youre awake though lmao she calls on people to read her slides. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE GREAT TEAM MATES AGAIN FOR THIS. Reports were really easy because we split them up and I honestly feel like shes an easy grader cause I know for sure that our reports were NOT cohesive. Quiz (not really a quiz honestly) took up the entire class time and it was a lot of short answers and open book. EASY. Presentation? EASY. We had to do 2 case studies worth 5%. EASY!!!! EASY GRADER FOR SURE! She is also sweet but again, got annoyed at her cause she talked sooo much at 9am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's the end of my time here! Hopefully this proved to be of some help to future baruch students out there. Happy Baruch-ing!",

Did not respond to emails timely.  \n\\[IN PERSON\\] ENG 2100 - Sheila Getzen 2/10  \nInstructions never clear, assignments a disaster.

Don\u2019t take in the morning.  \n\\[IN PERSON\\] CIS 2200 - Morris Schwartz 4/10  \nAlso boring, don\u2019t recommend taking this in the morning.

I don\u2019t think the online format works for this professor-begging students to turn on cameras turned me off from the class.  \n\\[ONLINE\\] MKT 3520 - Barry Soloff 6/10  \nNice guy just couldn\u2019t figure out the online format at all. Group project is kind of annoying but if you have a good group then you should be fine. Lots of work.  \n\\[IN PERSON\\] ART 3050 - Tom Lulevitch 6/10  \nReally only one big project for my portfolio that I didn\u2019t even end up using.  \n\\[IN PERSON\\] MGT 3120 - Roger Mckechnie 6/10  \nLessons were interesting. Nice guy, but I don\u2019t remember learning a thing.  \n\\[IN PERSON\\] MKT 3000 - Amitai Touval 6/10  \nGroup projects are good if you have a good group.

Easy easy assignments.  \n\\[IN PERSON\\] MSC 1003 - Jean Patrick Besingrand 10/10  \nStrict with attendance/being late (don\u2019t try and come late), but easy A elective if you study  \n\\[IN PERSON\\] ENG 2800 - Carina Pasquesi 10/10  \nAnother great English professor - super laid back and understanding.  \n\\[IN PERSON\\] JRN 3150 - Ben Hudson 10/10  \nTeaches amazing written/oral communication skills  \n\\[IN PERSON/ONLINE\\] ART 3056 - Joshua Whitehead 10/10  \nGreat class for people interested in typography. Don\u2019t be late  \n\\[ONLINE\\] ART 3058 - Howard Klein 10/10  \nGlad this was offered online, got to skip lots of the in person stuff that I probably would have been bad at.

Professor is nice  \n\\[ONLINE\\] CHM 1003L - Suzanne Charnick 10/10  \nSet up blackboard amazing, mini-lecture videos that you can pause/go back, clear about what\u2019s on the test. Fantastic professor.  \n\\[ONLINE\\] JRN 3510 - Lindsay Armstrong 10/10  \nFun class, involved going around taking photos/videos and recording audio and using editing software.  \n\\[ONLINE\\] BLS/HIS 3055 - Katie Uva 10/10  \nReally nice compassionate professor, easy writing assignments all semester, no tests.  \n\\[FULLY ONLINE\\] ART 3057 - Nick Rymer 10/10  \nGreat professor, great introduction to web design. All lectures are tutorial videos.  \n\\[ONLINE\\] ITL 4999 - D\u2019Amelio 10/10  \nSweetest professor, but this class is for serious Italian students. Whole semester is conducted in Italian, and the largest portion of the grade is speaking in class. Lots of reading and writing.  \n\\[ONLINE\\] ART 5900 - Whitehead 10/10  \nMuch better than a graphic design internship. Sets up portfolio, resume, cover letter, and one group project dedicated to social change.",

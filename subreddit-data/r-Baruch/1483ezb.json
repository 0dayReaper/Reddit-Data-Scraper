The midterm/final were both just east questions ripped straight from lectures and PowerPoints. She will upload a massive PowerPoint with every slide she shows before the final to blackboard, and everything you need for the final is on that PowerPoint. Super easy.",

The workload is easy, just take it a bit seriously and try to contribute to discussions and she\u2019ll love you for it",

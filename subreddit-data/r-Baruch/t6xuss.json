People get shamed for not wearing a mask all the time and those who chose not to wear one don\u2019t give a shit. So why do you gotta be all sensitive. Who gives a shit what people think of you. \n\nLike if someone has a good reason to wear a mask, like if they live with immunocompromised people for example or they simply just don\u2019t want to get sick alright cool. But when people are triple vaxxed, double masked, and scream at others that their killing people for not wearing a cloth mask that has been scientifically proven to do practically nothing to prevent covid, yea they\u2019re stupid. That\u2019s not shaming. They may think I\u2019m stupid for my views and I may think they\u2019re stupid for their views but that\u2019s life. We gotta stop being so god damn sensitive. Shit happens. People disagree. We deal with it.",

My parents have been exposed a million times and they\u2019re always asymptomatic and they\u2019re the only ones I\u2019d be worry about bringing it home to, but they\u2019ve been fine. So it\u2019s like whatever. \nI think it\u2019s great just to let everyone chose what they want to do. The vast majority of students are young and most likely healthy. Of course there\u2019s the fear of spreading it, but honestly for the moment, especially heading into warmer weather I think we\u2019ll be fine for now. Then next winter a new variant and the same damn cycle it\u2019s whatever",

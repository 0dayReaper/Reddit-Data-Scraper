            "comment": "Generally, a  technology focused degree program coming from a business school will be titled computer information systems, information systems or information systems management. All of these names describe a program with a basis in business curriculum where the emphasis is on applying technology to address business and other organization requirements.\n\nBy contrast, a computer science degree program will typically be based in mathematics and granted by a liberal arts school.\nA Computer engineering degree program will be based on an engineering curriculum and likely be granted by a school of engineering.\n\nIf you are considering a CIS major at Baruch College, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aHa50Z5D1Q) has some explanation of the major.",

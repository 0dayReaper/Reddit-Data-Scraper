    "postText": "Anyone else graduating this fall 2020 semester? Just so glad to be done with Baruch, it's been a rough 4.5 years... from switching majors from accounting to finance ONE semester before my intended graduation date because of gpa requirements and missing it by 0.1 points (YES 0.1 points), to commuting 1.5-2 hours one way, to struggling with business classes, to losing motivation, to struggling to find places to eat on campus because it's always packed, to waiting forever on the elevator lines at 10:40am, to sneaking in food to the library, to trying to find empty working bathrooms on each floor, to trying to get the attendance sheet asap so you can leave asap, to having to deal with financial aid &amp; advisement, shall I go on??\n\nFor those of you graduating this semester, CONGRATS! WE DID IT! WE ENDURED IT! What are your plans for after college?\n\nFor those of you who are still stuck at Baruch, I have no words to say but, GOOD LUCK! It may feel as if there is no hope, but time does fly and you'll be done before you know it. I know I will miss being a student and yes, Baruch... (maybe like 0.1%).\n\n\\*currently writing this post as I'm \"studying\" for my two finance finals tomorrow\\*",

Management... i was embarrassed to not have made the cut, i lost all motivation, i avoided people, i became depressed, i struggled with money, i was at the lowest. Here i am today, push through everything; working full time (thankfully), finished undergrad, on to masters, etc! To those fighting the good fight, don't give up!",

I'd like to say that I had a good time at Baruch, but that would be a lie. My biggest frustration was with advisement, class registration and transfer office. Reason why I took almost an entire year off was because I had no motivation to continue due to the fact that I couldnt register for classes that I needed. When I transfer from a CC I was taking 1-2 classes a semester cause I was working and had major problems with scheduling both classes and work. \n\nIt almost took me almost 3 semesters to resolve a mess that was caused by the administration in a sense that 15 credits that had transferred over to Baruch went missing and these people were telling me that I have to retake 5 classes cause Baruch decided to no longer offer the courses that had been credited by the transfer office. \n\nIt was just a mess. I am glad that I made some incredible connections with professors. Say what you want about Weismann, but some of the departments really know how to connect with students and offer them as much help as possible. \n\nHere I am now, waiting for my diploma and transcript so I can submit my grad school applications. I just hope that Cuomo and Bozo De Blasio won't order another shutdown cause then I won't be able to apply to grad school cause Baruch won't be issuing diplomas, like they did in spring.",

There are only 2 people in academic advisement that have been ever helpful to me - Vilmarie Rosario and Yulya Sokolovskaya. The person in charge of the advisement her name is Elaine something is a complete bitch. I've never, ever met a more rude, condescending person in my entire life in an academic setting.\n\nI was thinking about make a thread with general info and my own recommendations for professors, who to talk to in case you have and issue etc... but it's all Weismann related and most folks here are from Zicklin, so it's a waste of time.\n\nThe only regret that I have that is Baruch related is not participating in a study abroad. It was just not feasible for me due to work, but it also is a reason as to why I'm applying for master's overseas.",

Despite my completion in the accounting major, I definitely can feel the pain when you are forced to switch major. \n\nDuring my first semester in Fall 2018, I got one C and one C- in ACC300 and 3202. At that time I knew I screwed, and I was depressed, scared, and unmotivated because I didn't know what to major other than accounting. But then my friends encouraged me and told me don't give up. So for Spring 2019, I dedicated my entire semester with only one class, ACC3200 (yes, cost accounting). I was so happy ended up with a B+, and so I was more confident and that I pushed me beyond the threshold with an A in ACC3100.\n\nI finished my Auditing final yesterday and I looked back the whole journey. I am still terrified if I were told to switch major and probably not getting back up as fast as you did. Anyway, sorry for the long story here and again, Congratulations!! Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors :)",

Getting that bachelor was just personal for me, it wasn't just about the opportunities anymore. \n\nAs an international student, I already had a bachelor but getting jobs on my field wasn't happening. CUNY pretty much made me start all over as they allowed only a few credits to transfer. They even denied my application to a 4 years college. I could've gone to a private school but I didn't want to take on huge loans. So I started at a CC, went there full time while working two jobs with 50 hours a week. I got a salary job a semester after that and kept my full time status but work was less stressful at that point and just 40 hours a week with perks like work from home.\n\nI had a 4.0 the last semester and a 3.8 overall when I transferred to Baruch. The school was just a few train stops from work, so the commute was never a problem.  What I hated the most at Baruch was having to go part time two semesters in a row because the classes I needed were always full. Besides that, I like the campus and most of the professor I had. My favorite professor was Ian Owe, the weird and funny one was Harpaz.\nI'm not planning to go for my masters, It's time to start making money, especially outside of the 9 to 5 trap.\nGood luck to everyone graduating! To the rest, hang in there, you got this.",

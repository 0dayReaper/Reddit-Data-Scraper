Just asking that you don't wait until the night before it's due and that you actually read/try the assignment first before asking for help. \n\n(Why is it free? It's just a random hobby while I consider whether I want to become a teacher or not. That said, I only have time for a few ppl per week, so let me know. Also, later in the evening works best. )",

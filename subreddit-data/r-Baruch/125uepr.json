    "postText": "Hello\n\nI know I will have to take CIS2300 and the only class that meets my schedule is Stanley Wine? but his ratings isn't that great. How is he and can I put this class off another semester or will I not be able to take other CIS classes if I do not take it. I have tried to register for a CIS4100 class but it stated that I will need  CIS3100 class. \n\nThank you for any advise :)",

Generally, you can\u2019t take 3000 or 4000 level classes without taking the respective 2000 level (there are exceptions like finance and such where you can start with 3000)",

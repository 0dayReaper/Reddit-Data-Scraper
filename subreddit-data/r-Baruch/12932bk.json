    "postText": "Several students\u2026 along with myself have complained about the lack of help and communication we received from staff at the dean\u2019s office, finance department, and many other places at baruch. We live in a post 1st amendment world where one can be accused of slander and racism for speaking about issues completely unrelated as a result of gaslighting.\n\nThere needs to be change. I was treated horribly by the dean\u2019s office and completely disrespected. We the people are paying tax dollars for this type of staff and behavior??? \n\nEnough is enough. I think we all have a story of baruch\u2019s staff not helping us much. \n\nI am graduating. But for the rest of you guys. This is a problem. Plenty of people happy to take these great government jobs in their place.",

Sounds like this is a school wide issue. \n\nIn a private institution it would be much harder to fire this Art King guy\u2026 but again this is a public college. We pay his salary and the salaries of his staff. If they are incompetent in their jobs\u2026 they need to get extensive reviews or be fired after repeat offenses of not helping students. \n\nGovernment jobs have great benefits. It will not be hard to find replacements that can do better for the students of Baruch College.",

When someone would try to ask him a question or something he would disrespectfully shut them down\u2026 no other staff present in the meeting said anything to him. It was honestly a very saddening situation as an incoming freshman during your summer orientation being presented with someone so vulgar.",

I felt bad for the guy he did that to. This dumbass Art King truly deserves to lose his job and be homeless in my humble opinion.",

            "comment": "Definitely agree , poor quality staff in these departments, unable to give straight answers to students questions as well as making it very difficult to get in touch with them . Also wanted to point out that it seems that a lot of professors for these Pre requisite courses or business majors , very few have decent rating on rmp \u2026 these are classes that most students have to take yet a small percentage of professors are rated good .Of course Rmp may be biased in some ways ) . I don\u2019t think baruch is a bad school , in terms of the resources it provides , and the value \u2026but trying to access these resources and help from staff is very difficult and inefficient. Our tuition and taxes goes towards this and it sometimes feels like money down the drain when we can\u2019t access it",

Like sent an email to the Dean or the President of student affairs or provost or your student liaison or head of student government?\nBecause you have one time to be rude to me and then I\u2019m messaging and cc\u2019ing everybody. If you are a bad employee everyone in the school and then CUNY will know. \n\nWhen these people are rude to you they know what they are doing. They are just banking on the fact you won\u2019t tell anyone. Or that the people you do tell are the people they are friends with. That\u2019s why you have to tell everyone.",

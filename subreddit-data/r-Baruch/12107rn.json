Some questions asked us to solve equations.. don't know why this guy makes us do those very complicated calculations in a 1-HOUR exam. This is wayy harder than 3000. Also, his conceptual questions were tricky, which he didn't give us in sample exams. I need a course that gives exams with the exact same questions as homework.",

                            "comment": "Currently taking him as well, I did well on his midterm and rest of my class did fair but we agreed that it was a very reasonable midterm.\n \n1) don\u2019t stress too much since everyone who took him before said that he curves the grade at the end (hopefully it\u2019s true) \n2) not to sound rude but I mean you can\u2019t be seriously complaining about the math, I know hes legit the worst at teaching but did you go to to SACC for tutoring? Also he legit let us bring unlimited cheat sheets for the midterm. Also it\u2019s a upper level 3000s course almost considered a 4000s level course, It\u2019s supposed to be \u201cdifficult\u201d (for business majors at least lol) so that we become at least competent in our field of study and somewhat competitive in the job market lol (assuming if we choose to work in investments and use this knowledge). Also it\u2019s a point to mention that finance is leaning towards the more quantitative side now so your gonna have to face the math eventually, a lot of banks, hedge funds, asset managers are targeting engineering students for pretty much all analyst positions now except for commercial banking, corporate banking and wealth management I guess\n\nMy advice is that if you don\u2019t think a curve will be enough to pass then drop and retake, and to go over fin 3000, fin 3610 concepts and even a little bit of stat 2000 and to actually understand it rather than remember it. I have a deep understanding in it and so it made learning the math part easier imo. If you deeply understand conceptual then the math will follow. Cmon now we\u2019re business majors, this isn\u2019t engineering we can\u2019t complain otherwise the financial mathematics majors will laugh at us Lmaoo. \n\nIn all seriousness tho if you retake then take fin 3710 with Edward Malca, a lot of people say he\u2019s the best fin 3710 professor and that his class is easy",

    "postText": "I still needed 5 classes to graduate and there is a class offered in spring only. So I am not able to make it all in one semester. If I take extra liberal art course to keep my full-time student status, will TAP pay for these courses? I tried the ask the bursar advisor through the BOSS zoom section, but the lady said she is not going to answer any questions for future semesters.",

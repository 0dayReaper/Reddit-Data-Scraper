You guys are home, you got this.\u201d When in reality, I still have a job. Not sure if this may apply to every single person, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a handful of people with jobs still. I\u2019m a grocery store cashier, under immense stress at work. And these professors just think we\u2019re all home.. so why not pile the work on right? \n\n I\u2019ve been hearing the same thing from every professor I have.",

This is their job, and given the circumstances some of them might be doing better than others at teaching, but the reality is that they also have families to worry about, they also have to go out and make lines to buy food, they also have children and other problems. They\u2019re also making do with what they were given which is not much. Next semester there a lot of professors will be laid off because of the pandemic and they will lose their health insurance. So please, for many of us this is more than an inconvenience. If you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t eat. If you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t have health insurance.",

My ACC4100 Professor had only one lecture since online learning began, and it lasted for 50 minutes, while the class was supposed to be 4 hours. So basically I had only one 50-minutes class last month and Professor \u201csuggested\u201d reading a chapter or two to keep up. My FIN3000 Professor keeps ignoring my messages, while department is doing departmental review for ch.6-7, we are doing something else in class, like ch.11 and I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s gonna be on the midterm which is in one week. Also professor still assigns stupid problems from one month ago and no HW on new material we cover..\nThis semester is such a joke.",

In that case, you may not be able to request an e-permit.\n\nYou could email the Registar's Office for information. You could also ask the departments of the courses you need to take for permission to enroll in the courses even though they are full.",

For now, I would recommend getting on the waitlists while figuring out if it is possible in any way (probably is not). Just because the class is full doesn\u2019t mean u might not get in eventually. If those classes have no waitlists then download coursicle and monitor the classes. Good luck!",

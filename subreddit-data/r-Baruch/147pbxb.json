But that's OK, its just like that for the first semester. The following semester based on your GPA and grade level you will get an earlier enrollment date. But for now, welcome to Baruch. You made it.",

From the sound of it, you're getting your orientation late.\n\nHave you created your baruch email? They send the orientations there. Also download the navigate app, you might be able to sneak in an appointment, with existing orientation sessions.",

It can also be used to schedule an appointment for orientation when you are given permission to do so. Sometimes though you can register and they say they remove students that weren't given permission, but sometimes you could slip in.\n\nEdit: on second thought don't slip in, just email them instead they might include you on the next one. They have attendance sheets and I'd imagine your profile needs to get ready as well.",

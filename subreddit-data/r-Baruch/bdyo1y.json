The first thing they told me was that I should properly format the school name. They also showed me sample resumes and all of them were the same format.  \"Baruch College/CUNY - Zicklin School of Business\", \"Baruch College/CUNY - Weissman School of Arts and Sciences\", Baruch College/CUNY - Marxe School of Public Affairs\".",

It probably  helps to let your employer know you went to Langone and not Stern if you're getting a job as an orthopedist.",

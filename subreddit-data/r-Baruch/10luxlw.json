    "postText": "I know I might sound like a Karen but I was in the library just finishing up some work, and this group of individuals was talking so loud that I heard them over my headphones, and they were there for an hour doing this, I eventually did leave so they might have been there for longer. I am not even saying do not talk and socialize in the library, the library is one of the nicest parts of Baruch and I want people to be able to be comfortable and talk and meet with their friends but do not talk as if you are at a rock concert. There are people that actually just want to study, read, sleep, relax and or destress, just be mindful of them. Treat the library as a Starbucks, you can talk but do not be an asshole. (SIDE NOTE THE THINGS I HEARD WERE DISTURBING, DO YOU GUYS REALISE YOU ARE SAYING THIS IN A PUBLIC SETTING)",

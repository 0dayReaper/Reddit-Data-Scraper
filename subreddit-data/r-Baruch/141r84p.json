    "postText": "I\u2019m a junior finance major and I took fin 3610, 3710, and eco 4000 last semester. I passed all of those classes, but for fin 3610 and 3710 I passed with low grades, which affected my gpa requirement for those classes. I didn\u2019t meet the requirement only by a few points and now they\u2019re saying to change my major. I\u2019ve been crying for days cause I got so far and now this. Is there ANYTHING I can do to maybe retake the classes and stay in my major??? Any advice?",

Baruch weeds people out initially with mth2003 from getting into zicklin, after that theres another test, you have to pass those specific classes (in your major) with a certain grade overall among ALL three whether it's in finance or in the accounting major. If there all low grades and falls    below the requirement needed you cant continue any further into the 4000 level courses and they force you to change your major which is sad. It's just Baruch's way of weeding kids out and forcing you to pay more money for the additional classes for the new major. Alot of kids then transfer out and continue the business curriculum elsewhere at another school. Sorry to hear :(",

If you want to give it one last try, I would reach out to your profs and ask for them to fail you in those classes so that you can retake them but like others have said, grades have probably been final for a while now.\n\nIn the future, you should just keep a running tally of your grades to have an idea of what your class grade is going to look like. If it's not a surprise then you can either go to tutoring or ask to be failed.",

What I did was I transferred to another school, Brooklyn College. I\u2019m now continuing my Accounting degree at Brooklyn College. I have to take 30 credits to graduate here. The best advice is to transfer to another school and file a transfer application. And yeah, it might take you another year to graduate. I know how this feels!!!!!! ;( Good luck!!!!",

No only that, Tuesday &amp; Thursday are when most are hosted in the week.\n\nWhat about leadership experiences that come with being involved? Or making connections?

Narrow it down based on which class has the better professor through rmp, and Reddit.\n\nAlso, try to calm down. Yes, you are a transfer, but overloading yourself and doing badly in a few classes will kill your GPA. So, instead of trying to quickly get through it. Don't be afraid to take it slow. Join some clubs, network, and create a social life. Because, at the end of the day, it will help improve your resume.",

    "postText": "Accounting major, received a C- for acc3000 and prob a B- for acc3202. Taking acc3100&amp;3200 this summer. The rule for accounting major is to have minimum of 2.5 GPA in these 4 courses. At this point should I just ask for F (delay graduation by 1 year since acc3000 is the prerequisite) or just take the C- and try my hardest to get Bs in those 2 classes in the summer. Any suggestions is appreciated \ud83e\udd79.",

But if the professor allows it, i would redo the class as 3100 is more challenging than 3000 and 3200 is the toughest out of the four.",

            "comment": "If I am correct, for the letter grade to be curved (so like an A is having 85 in class, not a 93+) depends on the overall class if they did poorly. It happened in a microeconomic class before, so it\u2019s not impossible I hope that answer that question. However, wait until to see what the class average is cuz they will probably curve that exam, you can get a good grade just study more for the final since the final is worth more than midterms and keep up with hws.",

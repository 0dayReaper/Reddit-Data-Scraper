    "postText": "Folks:\n\nIt has come to my attention that some on-line courses may have a note on the course description regarding the need to participate in an in-person midterm and/or an in-person final exam.\n\nPlease check your courses carefully, especially if you signed up for a course marked \"On-Line Synchronous\" or \"On-line Asynchronous\".  If in doubt, consider contacting the professor so you are certain of how the exam will be delivered.\n\nAs an example, search for CIS 2200 in Fall 2023 and look for Section ETRA Class Number 17252 (Isak Taksa). \n\nObviously courses listed as \"In-Person\" or \"Hybrid-Synchronous\" or \"Hybrid-Asynchronous\" require you to come to campus for at least some or all the class sessions and so these will likely include in-person exams.",

Focus on the choices you have available and take the best option on May 1st.   If a Baruch acceptanse comes in afterward and you still prefer to go there, you will lose the first deposit but it is no bid deal, college will suck up your life, time, and money over the next few years so consider the loss a small down payment on your education.",

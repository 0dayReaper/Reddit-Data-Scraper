    "postText": "I'm currently taking 4 classes for 12 credits this semester and am full-time for financial aid. It's nearing the end of sem and I'm doing horribly in one of the classes and am thinking of dropping before deadline. How does this affect my financial aid for this sem/next sem? I am enrolled in 5 classes for fall 23.",

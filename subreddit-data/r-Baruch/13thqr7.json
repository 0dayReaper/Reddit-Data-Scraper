            "comment": "I'm pursuing my Masters with Baruch right now while working full-time and it's absolutely manageable. The time it'll take to get my degree is projected to be 2.5 years total, which entails taking 2-3 classes a semester and an occasional winter or summer session class.\n\nI'm in the MPA program so I can't speak much to the curriculum of Business Analytics, but I think pairing one quant class with a qual class makes it the easiest workload to handle (for example a business class heavy in reading and writing paired with a stats class more focused on math). Makes it much easier to manage expectations and schedule homework that way imo.",

To graduate in 2 years, you will need to take 3 classes per semester (this is considered full time, you cannot take more than 3 classes btw). So it's really up to you. You can take 1-2 per Fall and Spring, and I don't know about Business Analytics, but my program also offers Winter and both Summer sessions.",

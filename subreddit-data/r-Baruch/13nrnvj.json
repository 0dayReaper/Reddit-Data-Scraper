Note this section:\n\nFirst college experience: We accept applications from first-time college students (incoming Freshmen). We do not accept transfer students, or anyone who has attended classes at a post-secondary institution after high school, whether or not any credit was granted. Students who attended college classes (such as College Now) ARE eligible to apply to Macaulay.\n\n\nMore about the [Zicklin Scholars program](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/zicklin-undergraduate-honors-program/)",

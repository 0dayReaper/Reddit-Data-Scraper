            "comment": "Your concerns are valid. It is a challenge to get into some sections. In Baruch's defense, they outlined the criteria for selecting the students for these classes.  You are 30+ credits away from graduation and probably have enough classes to take without the capstone. So once you qualify, you don't have to beg or worry, you are granted a seat there.\n\nAs for your second question, the department's budget is not unlimited and it is hard to hire staff to fill the classes.",

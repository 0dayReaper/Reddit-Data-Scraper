A lot of professors don't really care if you actually learn, but rather if you can pass their exam. It's crazy that when I entered CIS 3500, nobody knew the basics like what bits are or how many bits in a byte. Keep in mind CIS 3500 is one of the last classes for your major in CIS: Cybersecurity.",

I could probably pay off my tuition . I really wonder if people are really this clueless or is common sense not that common . \n\nAm I the only one who got a syllabus \u2026.. or has access to the internet . People keep asking about the final examination dates . When you can literally google : Baruch Final Examination Schedule and boom the answer pops up.\n\nI know this can\u2019t be the next gen of people going into the workforce \u2026\u2026.",

It wasn't until one day I finally answered, \"Hey x, how many times have you asked that question this semester? And how many times have we all responded that there IS class? From now on, we'll tell you whenever we don't have class, okay?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe never asked again. Sometimes you have to make people realize how dumb or annoying their questions are!",

What do we have to do for this assignment?\" over and over again. These are also the same people who cannot handle a tough professor and will break down if the Professor is a little bit rude. (I hesitate to use the word rude, because the Prof is just doing what anyone would do in the real world) They also think the Professor needs to accomodate to them (LOL)\n\nThey grew up on their phones, and I also grew up on technology. Still, I managed to have enough social interactions to develop enough mental toughness to have initiative.\n\nMy theory is that because they did not develop any mental toughness or any tolerance, they are very soft and are broken apart by the smallest of obstacles. This puts their mind in a state of fear, where they are unable to do simple tasks, such as reading a syllabus.",

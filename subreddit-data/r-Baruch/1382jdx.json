Those classes usually get full like during the first day registration opens and only Honor students in the program get to register on the first day. Even seniors with 110 credits had to register on the 2nd day and by then most of the classes are full and waitlist are almost full. The professors are also hit or miss. You get to pick your classes but the problem is how can we pick our classes when everyone has a different registration time with limited seats in classes. Example would be a Capstone Comm class where everyone needs to take and they only have like 2 classes for it and it only has 20 seats and No wait list like wdf? Hard for me to not think that they want to stall students from graduating on time or early.",

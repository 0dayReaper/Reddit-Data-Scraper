    "postText": "I know most of you are burnt out this semester but you all are SO close. Don\u2019t give in, ace those tests, and get that big smile on your face when you get your grades. That small satisfaction you get for taking it easy is nothing compared to the sadness that you will feel if you give up now. We just have to suffer for now to rest easy later. \n\nBut resting is not for now. \n\nThis is the point in the marathon that we have to run. The last meters to go. The best part of your leisure time after is knowing that you can have fun without that feeling of regret. \n\nSo good luck everyone.",

Some professors have all this time to prepare on how to deliver online lessons, but they still can't get a grasp on it and are making it extremely difficult for students.",

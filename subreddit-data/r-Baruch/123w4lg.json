A lot of info is presented through slides (which he shares) but prepare to take notes to memorize for info that isn't on the slides occasionally. He has relatively high expectations for quiz/test scores.",

But I wouldn't rely on having the slides open because you would have to spend a few minutes searching for the one that contains your answer and then sifting through them.\n\nThe journal entries are the essays. They're just one to one and a half page responses to a prompt (double spaced). You just have to incorporate what you learned in class while coherently convrying your opinion, and he just gives you full marks.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is one of those classes that doesn't really bleed into your personal time outside of class as long as you follow along in class.",

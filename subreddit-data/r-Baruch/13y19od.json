    "postText": "I recently got an offer for a HR internship with a small software company , 100-200 employees, 6 months duration, 40th floor office in Fulton st, paid and the staffs are amazing . I really want this internship \n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s another opportunity to intern for NYC dept of buildings, haven\u2019t got any offer and hiring managers asked me to call her. Assuming I get an offer, what should I do in this situation? \n\nIn one hand I really like the small fast growing internship and on the other hand I can work for the NYC govt? Idk if interning means a city job? \n\nAny suggestions? \n\nI feel like interning for the NYC dept of buildings will build my resume as stronger and more credible, for long run it\u2019s the better clearly. \n\nIdk guys .. help",

Did you have to pay back all or some of the money or were there any repercussions?\n\nThank you in advance.",

Once you dip below 12 credits, you will not be eligible for the full amount of TAP/FASFA you had when you were taking 12 credits. However, you will still receive some, so I don't believe you will have to pay the whole tuition.",

From what I've heard from asking around is that we'll have to pay back some money and someone else told me that it's possible that they don't give you Tap for the fall 23 semester. \n\nIf you do happen to come across more info let me know as well please.",

I found this online\n\n[https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/tap-guidance-last-semesters-of-eligibility.pdf](https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/tap-guidance-last-semesters-of-eligibility.pdf) \n\nI'm pretty sure in my senior year I won't have enough courses left to take to get 12 credits toward my degree. Is this an actual thing? And how does tap know it's my last semester?",

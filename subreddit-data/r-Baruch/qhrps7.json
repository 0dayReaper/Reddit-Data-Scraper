    "postText": "Im in group chats for my classes because I like to keep up but wow some people are so stupid it is frightening. I had a class in person this week and everyone was being super helpful about the location and how to get there. Someone legit said \u201cok but record yourself walking in so I can follow that same path\u201d ??? Is that not STRANGE to y\u2019all?! 2 months+  into class and people are still asking what time class starts. \n\n\nEveryone is also so damn lazy asking questions that are on blackboard or have been emailed god forbid they actually look for themselves instead of having everything spoon fed. And honestly if you respond to the stupidity that gets asked I feel like you\u2019re a part of the problem too. Stop enabling! These are adults!!!!\n\n\n* an hour after posting this someone legit messaged me DIRECTLY on what\u2019s app asking about a project cause \u201cthey saw I was active\u201d what the f????? I am not a professor",

They ask stupid questions like why is it  this and not that, you can read the textbook and see that is what the rule said, like Jesus christ\ud83d\ude02",

The classes, although hard, are extremely rigorous and the student life is great for a commuter school. Stop shitting on Baruch all the time \ud83d\ude02.",

I had an advisor tell me it was ok to take a class but it didn\u2019t sit well with me and I went to another advisor who asked me why was I even registered for it!!! Also when I first started Baruch they told me to take a math class that was suppose to be mandatory, I did an appointment with Lirie Kurtaj, come to find out the class has nothing to do with my major ...... I had to drop the class but was thankful to Lirie because she is the best advisor very on point, vilma Rosario helped as well with the first situation so those two are the better advisors!! Stay clear of the Russian advisor can\u2019t remember her name but she\u2019s useless",

Turned out that Professor is a first semester grad student and due to him being in the US for only two years his accent was really harsh and half of the class was blinking and stopped attending after a few lectures. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, accent is fine, NYC is a capital of diversity, but when you cannot understand what professor is saying it\u2019s not cool. I saw that he really tried, but no one could understand what he was saying. Perhaps he needed a bit more practice before teaching? \nAnother case: I had a prof that bragged about teaching at NYU. But he was plain horrible and rambled on and on non stop. If there were any questions he would re-read the sentence from the slide. Why did he even think that just because he was an NYU Professor it made him a good one? If you take the worst Adjuncts from NYU, Pace and Columbia you can\u2019t say: Baruch Professor are top-notch.

The professors are top of the line and have gotten their degrees from prestigious universities all across the world.  The classes, although hard, are extremely rigorous and the student life is great for a commuter school.  Stop shitting on Baruch all the time \ud83d\ude02.",

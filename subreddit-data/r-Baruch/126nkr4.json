There\u2019s a group presenting every week, and you have to participate in the discussions to get points. There\u2019s no rec for ENV 1004, only for 1003L. Also take professor haggerty for both 1003 and 1004.",

So the way the schedule works is that you have one group presenting every week. For example, in your case it would be a presentation on Tuesday. On Tuesdays, all you have to do is watch the group presentation, nothing else, once the group presentation finishes, the classes usually ends. On fridays it would be the student led collaboratives, where the group presenters ask questions about their project to all other classmates. Participation is required in order to get points for these types of days. So maybe, although I don\u2019t recommend it, you can skip Tuesdays rec class, and attend only fridays rec classes to get the participation points.",

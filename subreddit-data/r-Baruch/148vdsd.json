    "postText": " I would understand if it\u2019s only for classes that are near capacity or full since that means you are actively stoping someone else from getting the class spot but if there are multiple seats open when the class starts it doesn\u2019t really seem fair. especially since the amount you pay for the summer doesn\u2019t get applied to the other class you might add late or in the second session. Really wish the student government addressed stuff like this.",

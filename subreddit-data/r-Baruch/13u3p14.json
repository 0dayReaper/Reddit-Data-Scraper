    "postText": "A month ago I was literally frightened of how bad the rest of the class and I were doing. Did some calculations on Excel for what I needed to get that C average for the 3 Finance classes. Had the worst professors too while taking these classes. Well... Somehow it's now all over, grades are posted and I actually did better than I projected! Don't ask me how, hell it's a gift from the heavens \ud83d\ude01. Who else was in this situation and made it out alive???",

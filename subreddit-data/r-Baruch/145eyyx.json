            "comment": "His class is very conceptual. 35% of grade is final, midterms are 25% a piece and there are two of them. 15% of grade is homework. Class average during spring 2023 was a C-, the class is not an easy A. He is an exceptional teacher but expect the class to be difficult. Will curve you up if you show up and participate. \n\nSource: One of our members who took Malca for Fin3710 in Spring 2023",

I\u2019m taking Malca as well next semester, and was wondering if you or any of your other members have advice for how to do well in his class. \n\nAfter hearing that the average is so low now I\u2019m thinking of possibly taking a different professor, but sadly it\u2019s pretty limited and the other profs are Scot Perlin, Aref Bolandnazar, Qiuping Zhang, and Theodor Eytan who have either similar or worse reviews. Which do you think might be a good alternative option?",

Quiping Zhang gives the worlds hardest tests but curves a lot, Aref Bolandmazar is easier but structures his class similarly. Can\u2019t speak about Eytan or Perlin because I don\u2019t know much about them. \n\nRegardless, you\u2019re going to have to study hard - it\u2019s just a question of do you want easier tests with no curve and a lower class average (Malca) or harder tests but a higher class average after the curve (Zhang and Bolandnazar)",

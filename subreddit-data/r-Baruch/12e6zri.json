    "postText": "All those posts about not having ppl to talk to or interact with on Baruch campus... ~~welp I'm not here to solve that lmao but~~ **why don't we do something fun??**\n\n**Does anyone still have their 3ds?** as you may know, the recent 3ds eshop closure has caused a resurgence in appreciation for Nintendo's last true handheld. People are apparently bringing their 3ds devices outside hoping to catch another person of culture through streetpass and relive the glory days of digitally meeting random people just by perusing the streets. I too miss greeting the occasional straggler in my mii plaza or pokemon rumble world.\n\n**How does it work?** Well you just turn on the device, put down the screen, and hope another person who did the same is within close proximity. The device flashes a green light to alert you ~~and you get a few seconds of enjoyment before returning to the reality that this device is over a decade old yet still with loving supporters near you (hopefully).~~\n\n**I am on Newman Vertical campus on Monday and Wednesday afternoons** (when classes are in session ofc). Maybe you might catch me playing it in the library lobby instead of listening in a zoom class. Whatever it may be, I hope someone read this and thought \"wow, something to do besides cry in the library corner! Let's connect!!\"\n\nI'd love to chat but knowing I have the social skills of a brick, it might be better to meet through our mii plazas. Hope to ping at least 1 person before I graduate. See you then hopefully :))) ~~(oh darn this post was buried by people asking for good classes and club settings)~~",

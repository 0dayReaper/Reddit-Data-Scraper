I\u2019m in Macaulay rn bc besides free tuition, they give students a free MacBook laptop (I believe they\u2019re still doing that). But if gpa is your top concern, full tuition from Dean\u2019s Scholars is still great",

Also, for Macaulay, after freshman year the requirement goes up to 3.5 from 3.3. As a Macaulay student the GPA requirement is annoying. The seminars suckkkk. But its rlly cool to know people from other campuses and Macaulay has some unique opportunities/ events that might add to your college experience in a way Baruch can\u2019t.",

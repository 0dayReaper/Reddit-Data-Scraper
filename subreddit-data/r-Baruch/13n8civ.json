The only reason I didn\u2019t find a girlfriend at Baruch was because I was dating someone I met in high school. \n\nThree girls showed interest in me during my freshman year but I didn\u2019t want to lose the relationship I had with my gf at the time. \n\nMe and my ex gf were pretty much glorified friends with benefits that had strong romantic feelings, neither of us was mature enough for a relationship. We just told her parents that we were dating so I could get away with coming over so much to their house. \n\nAfter a while we got serious about the relationship and covid hit. Covid was another reason we stayed together so long. Her parents let me come and the pandemic brought us closer. I\u2019d do my coursework in her house. We\u2019d take naps together. Watch movies. Do puzzles\u2026. It was nice while it lasted. \n\nAnyways you\u2019ll meet someone if you go to clubs just don\u2019t be obvious about it. Go with the flow and practice social skills. Eventually you\u2019ll get close with someone who also wants a partner and hit it off.",

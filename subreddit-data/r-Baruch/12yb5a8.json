Plan to study extra.\n\nReview textbook, slides, and practice questions on your own.  \n\nParticipate in class, most people don't tell you this as the average individual suffers from social anxiety but participation has been shown in research to help retain what you learn in class and offers better memory recall. Ask questions, don't worry about being annoying because the people that will find you annoying will likely be lower grade students anyways. \n\nIt also helps the Professor remember you during grading time, and if you're a few points short from a letter grade, the prof might give it to you because they remember you.\n\n\nStay away from co-dependent and manipulative students who come in the guise of wanting help but really they just want to copy your work. Draw a firm boundary and tell these students to f*ck off. \n\n\nShift responsibility of your grade onto yourself. Don't blame external factors. Bad grade? Study harder. Professor doesn't explain things properly? Study harder. When you have this mindset you can control your own life. \n\n\nMost of all remain confident and focused, I wish you the best of luck this semester. You got this",

There\u2019s not gonna be any tricks to the intro class (well I hope not lol). My personal study habits would be to always read ahead of what\u2019s scheduled for class then after class read it again to see if I truly understand. Also I always go to office hours so the professor knows my face and maybe doesn\u2019t harshly graded my exams lmaooooo. Also always ask your accounting profs if the textbooks problems are like the exams cuz if they are, easy practice, if not, google and see what\u2019s online for more practice",

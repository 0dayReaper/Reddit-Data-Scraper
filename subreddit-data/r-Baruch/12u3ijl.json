    "postText": "I\u2019m currently in between choosing colleges, I visited Baruch recently, there\u2019s not really much to look at but I was interested in a few programs they offer. I also visited Villanova yesterday and thought it was a gorgeous campus. However, I\u2019m going to pay 22k for villanova, but if I commute to baruch i\u2019ll go for free i would just have to buy a metro card. I plan on majoring in finance but don\u2019t know what career path exactly. For perspective my family makes around 90k a year pre tax. I need to hear your opinions",

You would spend 22k the first year but if you plan on transferring to baruch itll be no problem since itll be free. see if you can lower the cost either through scholarships or something else",

Baruch does have a the same professional opportunities as most school at a better cost and especially in finance you would have a bunch of opportunties to meet top industry employers and going clubs that can push your career. However, the social life aspect doesnt come easily, you really have to put yourself out there to make friends.",

I have talked to alumni and current students who have told me about the effort I will have to put into getting recruited since Baruch lacks the prestige Boston college has. Baruch offers limited job fairs and recruiting services compared to a college like bc but is able to hold its own academically. I spent hours on linkdeln looking at statistics and where people work and I\u2019ve concluded that in nyc Baruch and BC recruit about the same. As long as you put in effort to get recruited you will get a high paying job. I was also told that social life is not bad at all as long as you make an effort to join clubs and activities you will make loads of friends. For me BC was 47000 and Baruch 15000 since I was forming. I committed to Baruch because of the ROI and all the amazing things I\u2019ve heard. Do your research but from what I know Villanova is not as prestigious and BC. If it were me I would take Baruch. Do ur research and if u have any questions feel free to PM me.",

You will be able to get your foot into the door so much easier, and the name brand will carry so much weight later in your career. I think many people make the argument that you can get these great jobs from Baruch (which is true) but many do not realize that it can hold you back later down the road. Ofc you will have to try just as much at Nova, but that\u2019s at every school. I think you will be successful at both schools, this is a matter of cost at this point for you and what you are comfortable with.",

However Baruch is the largest AACSB  accredited school in the country and the average graduate does not fare as well as Villa's average graduate so you have to also consider where you will fall in the mix.  \n\nThe government  site   [collegescorecard.ed.gov](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov) has useful salary data by  major to inform  decisions.    Villanova has about 265 finance bachelors graduates who earn about $88K three years after graduation while Baruch has 937 graduates earning about $58K.  The difference is that the Villa network is closer to front office departments while the average Baruch student who winds up at the same company, but in middle office or back office roles.   As an example, there is large variance in finance salaries between Sales and Trading,  risk compliance, and  an admin job clearing trades.",

    "postText": "Don't get me wrong, I think everyone deserves a chance at a higher education but the recent acceptance rate is alarming. When I first started at Baruch it was a place for kids that got into NYU, Cornell, Duke...etc, but couldn't afford to go due to them basically charging a arm, a leg and your first born as tuition. Recently, the people coming in seem like they are not up to the reputation that Baruch once had. Don't get me wrong I hope these people succed in life but over crowding the school with kids that shouldn't be getting in is not good for the school as a whole and the mental health of kids that shouldn't be getting in. I hope everyone does well that comes here and becomes multi millionaires but desotrying the last good CUNY with a decent repuation, in the name of equality and or extra funding is just backwards thinking. Kids that might have went to Baruch because of its decent reputation and low cost might now instead choice to go to NYU and basically live in debt because of the lowering of the standards. Again this is not knock on the kids that already are in here but a knock on the adminstration for lowering the standards of the school.",

We are two different schools with two different Crown Jewels (accounting/fin math vs ib). The vast majority of students here would go to Cornell if they got into it since they have generous aid. Another thing that doesn\u2019t get talked about is how the standards have been low for transfer students but it went under the radar since they weren\u2019t as bad as these freshmen.",

            "comment": "As an alum and someone that\u2019s been in the workforce, no one really cares where you got your undergrad degree from. Undergrad is so generic across the US with all the gen-eds. The time to think about prestige and all that is at the grad-level. \n\nUnless you\u2019re only aiming for front-office, high finance gigs where prestige matters, you\u2019re not going to have an uphill battle. Even that can be compensated for by networking (which is all it really boils down to anyway for those jobs and many jobs in general). Look at the business frats and clubs like IMG\u2014those are very strong pipelines. Their standards definitely haven\u2019t devalued\u2014they probably went up and are now more selective given the bigger student population. If you seek it out, there are opportunities to stand out and make more of your experience at Baruch. \n\nAdditionally, other students\u2019 performance doesn\u2019t affect you. In fact, if these other kids are at such a lower standard, you should be able to be a big fish in a big pond. \n\nOnce your interviewing, the main thing employers care about is if you can do the job (you need a relevant background/major ofc) and if you have a good personality (ability to work with other people). The degree is simply a checkbox and becomes less important over time. In all job interviews, no one questioned about pedigree. It was all about relevant experience and projects. In the corporate workforce, the only people who care about pedigree are junior employees, interns, and high finance drones.",

Motivation is good but some opportunities should be left to the people that earned them instead of overcrowing a school and ruining it for all.  I wish well for all and I hope everyone succeeds and makes more money than they can imagine and I know where you are coming from but this is exaclty what runied the CUNY system in the 1970s when they let everyone in and destoryed the CUNY brand. u/w0za",

            "comment": "I'm sorry but wut? First of all, no one who is actually the top of their class is going to live in debt going to any school. That's where scholarships come in.  I say that as a older student with actual workforce and business experience. If you got into Cornell, NYU, Columbia , etc for undergrad, go to those schools. For Grad school it's a bit different. For example, Baruch actually has one of the best graduate Industrial/Organizational Psychology programs in the country. Once you get into PHDs, it really depends on the Research Lab and what niche you are interested in filling. Baruch doesn't need a lower acceptance rate, it needs an attitude adjustment.",

Then spend the big bucks on a solid graduate school with a high pedigree.  \"CollegeBored12\" guy is right. If you lower the standards, the school risks losing that valuable accreditation.\n\nLowering standards to be equitable is an insult to everyone.  1. It destroys the reputation of the school, which in turn will have employers shun our school. 2. It is a slap in the face for those that worked really hard to get here.  3. It is giving someone who is not capable of the workload (based on history of subpar grades), the seat that actually belongs to someone prepared for the level of work, determination and comprehension required. 4. It sets up the lower performer for failure, and probably quitting college altogether. What those individuals need is to go to Community College first, so they can be brought up to speed, and therefore be successful.",

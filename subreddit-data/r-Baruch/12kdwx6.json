You then take courses in discrete math and introduction to computer programming and algorithms (basically an intro to Python). The classes are challenging and time consuming, but imo they\u2019re definitely worth the learning experience. While they might hurt your gpa, it could still look good on your resume because you will have knowledge about computers and coding, which pairs up well with other majors.",

I had private tutors and was still stressed mainly because I was also working internships during the school year too so I had no time. HOWEVER, if your looking for finance jobs then don\u2019t unless you know your good at math cause once your GPA drops below 3.2 it\u2019s gonna be hard for your resume to past the screening algorithm. Note that this doesn\u2019t always apply if you already had good internship(s) prior to it dropping \n\nWas a CS minor then changed minors cause my GPA tanked and made it hard to find internships since most jobs have screeners for GPA &gt;3.0. Calc 2 dropped my GPA down to 3.1 from 3.75 and discrete math dropped me to 2.7 smh had to retake that class 3 times and decided to switch minors after the midterm. I\u2019m now a law and policy minor. I personally don\u2019t regret it tho because it\u2019s was a good learning experience for me",

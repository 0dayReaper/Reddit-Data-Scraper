    "postText": "I am a 22 year old male graduating from college. I drive a great car, I\u2019ve got great grades, I\u2019m attractive, I\u2019m extremely relatable to most people I interact with in my age group\u2026.. but I\u2019m alone. I am a loner. I just don\u2019t fit in with anyone in particular. \n\nWhen I see girls in my age group.. I notice that many of them don\u2019t have the same struggles that I do. When they get upset\u2026 there are usually guys in line waiting to be their shoulder to cry on in hopes that they\u2019ll get a shot with them whether that be companionship through friendship or a romantic relationship. \n\nFrom my perspective, it feels like many attractive women are alone by choice. To be alone by choice is significantly different than being alone because nobody acknowledges your existence. \n\nBeing alone when you have 50 unread messages from people interested in you is much different than being alone waiting for a notification to pop up from\u2026. Literally anyone. \n\nI feel attention starved. I don\u2019t want to come off as paranoid. But it feels as if there is a lot of fear mongering against me behind the scenes meant to manipulate people into feeling that I am the problem, and that in order to protect themselves from me.. that they need to ignore me until I die alone of old age. A sad, slow, and agonizing death appears to await me. Even though I am not suicidal.",

And you\u2019re still very young, being in a romantic relationship isn\u2019t that serious. people come and go but when the time is right and the people are right you\u2019ll be able to make great relationships. But in all seriousness I think you should talk to a therapist because mental health wellness is more impactful in improving relationships with yourself and others.",

It\u2019s about deliberately induced *SOCIAL ISOLATION* against someone who attempted to tell their peers about mass corruption. I have a therapist by the way. Every week I see her we talk about how to cope with evil people ruining my life that are above her pay grade. Therapy isn\u2019t helping. These people are criminals and they are addicted to getting away with everything.",

All my friends at the time warned me that this girl\u2019s family was very two faced and corrupt. I tried to see the good in them but that was the last straw. They never let her dress nicely around me. However, when it came to a boy whose mom had money\u2026 the mother forced my girlfriend to dress up for him in a tight shirt showing off her body. \n\nAs a result.. he hit on her, showed her videos of him having sex with another girl to tempt her\u2026 and he was high the whole time. He visited her a few weeks later and raped her. Because his mom has influence\u2026 that guy is untouchable. No consequences at all for his actions. Absolutely nothing because he\u2019s mommy\u2019s little angel who can do no wrong\u2026. and he\u2019s one of the major reasons I\u2019m in therapy.",

I feel like society views men who are alone.. whether that be by choice or circumstances.. as outcasts\u2026. Or in many cases potential criminals. Which can be harmful to the mental health of a person who just wants friends but doesn\u2019t know how to socialize without going on tinder or other dating websites\u2026 even if he isn\u2019t inherently interested in dating.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone.\n\nHas anyone here filed for a loan adjustment for Summer 2023/Fall 2023 financial aid? Normally when I file it during previous years the adjustments are made usually in 24-48 hours. Now you are supposed to wait 45 business days for your loan to get adjusted. Anyone else facing delays on their loan adjustment request?",

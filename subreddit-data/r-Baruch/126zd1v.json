            "comment": "Honest hot take. I think they didn't have enough classes/profs when they first started that class. \n\nHear me out. They changed the curriculum recently from COM 1010 to Com 2020. So there had to be at least 1 or two semesters where they had to offer both classes since people were still on the old curriculum. That means for those 2 semesters they didn't have enough seats for the new people and then it cascades since there's a bottle neck. So older students who completed more credits register for the class first since. Lots of students get bogged down due to precal so they have tons more credits than students younger then them. This leads to people who are \"Upper seniors\" not realizing that there's a TON of super seniors, because either A, they might be seniors but again, because of the math, they got held up and not even close to graduating, so they'll graduate with far more than 124+ credits, or B. They're accouting majors trying to get to 150 credits for the CPA exam. Since the school does registration by credits completed, it doesn't matter one bit that \"I'm an upper senior\" when you have 105 credits and a few thousand students have far more. But to do registration any other way wouldn't be fair. \n\nBut then again, that doesn't help you one bit.",

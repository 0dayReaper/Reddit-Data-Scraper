So, I applied and was just wondering how long I\u2019d have to wait until hearing back about whether I\u2019m in or not. Am also wondering how competitive Dean\u2019s Scholar is just to get a gauge of my chances of getting into it?",

Even then, I had to ask whether I was actually accepted or not by emailing undergrad admissions (vague email). You might want to email them if you don't hear back from them. \n\nI unfortunately do not know how competitive the program is, but I think there are about 50 incoming Dean's Scholars every year. \n\nCongrats on being considered for the program, by the way.",

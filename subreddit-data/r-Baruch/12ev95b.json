    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am basically a senior, and I will be graduating next spring. I wanted to know if the school takes senior portraits. I'm trying to see how they look or if I should have my own photo shoot because I'm looking through the hashtags on IG and Pinterest and haven't seen any really (the oldest pic I've seen was one from 2015) \n\nAnd any heads up as a senior that I should know about deadlines or ordering stuff when the time comes around??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance !!",

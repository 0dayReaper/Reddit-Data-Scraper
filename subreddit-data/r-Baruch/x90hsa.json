We are adults, one or two members *cannot* do everything for you. They don\u2019t even care about the project or the due date and we are all going to be graded the same. \n\nI get it, if you have a lot of obligations. All of us do. We can still communicate and make it work, you can\u2019t just choose not to do it and make the rest of us suffer. \n\nYes, I can always tell the prof about the situation. However, I don\u2019t want to be putting pressure on someone who may already be struggling. \n\nIf you\u2019re one of the members who expect others to do it for you, please try to put in some effort to communicate when you\u2019re available. This isn\u2019t high school.",

Also dont be afraid to go to the professor if you're group isn't performing to par and definitely let your group know you will go to the professor if they don't start stepping up. One class I actually had to tell my group I was gonna let my professor know no one was trying to do any work and all of a sudden everyone in my group wanted to contribute all of a sudden.

Good professor tbh, there's weekly readings that you gotta do but its not too long (20-40 pages max per week I think). As a grader, he is okay, he kinda graded the midterm paper harshly but he went easy on the final paper and term paper (considering that he never posted the grades but I went from a B- to a B+ so I can't complain lol)",

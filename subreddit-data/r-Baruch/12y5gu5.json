Don\u2019t just apply to the ones you want. Sometimes you have to work your way up and get that terrible internship that barely qualifies as one to get to the next step and so on. At the end of the day any internship is better than no internship, even if it isn\u2019t related to your major, an example would be accounting major doing an internship in marketing or product management, data analyst, etc.\n\nFor me I\u2019m also a finance major and I couldn\u2019t get an internship until I found a tax internship and from there I worked my way to wealth management. Now I\u2019m landing many interviews for equity research, wealth management and investment analyst.",

Often they have their own network that you can rely on to hone in on your interests, make connections, and potentially acquire a mentor that can vouch for you. Coffee chats are super underrated imo, set a goal for yourself to have at least 1 coffee chat a month. \n\nThese orgs usually have events where they do resume reviews and interview prep. As you get more involved, try to land a leadership role in an org that you can put on your \u201cleadership and activities\u201d tab on your resume. \n\nManagement Leadership for Tomorrow is a great program with an extensive network that you can apply for in your sophomore year. Use LinkedIn to find a Baruch student who was in the program and connect with them for advice on submitting the best application. \n\nI would use this template for your resume - [Goldman Sachs Resume Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14fioPT7ftzL62CXoYRkeGzp2vCBeIjSj/view?usp=drivesdk) (lmk if that opens ive never linked something on reddit.. i can include screenshots below)",

Cousins, uncles, friends, and friends of friends are your best bet, don't be shy, put out the word.  You don't need a high level summer job but you need \"a\" job so you can leverage the experience into an internship next year when it really counts.  If all else fails, walk in to real estate offices, financial advisors, retail banks, someone must be need cheap help if you cast your net wide enough.",

Straight up sales and really no need for an MBA, but I\u2019m also currently studying for CFA level 1 cause I want to keep the door open for a career in portfolio management. MBA is good for people who didn\u2019t really study business in undergrad. Depending on what you want to do, program, and school. You can go into IB as an associate, or go the consulting route and become an Associate or senior consultant depending on the firm.",

I just got elite work ethic, and I love what I do. I work at JPM. Wealth management is great if you\u2019re the type of person to go above and beyond because your performance will determine your commission.",

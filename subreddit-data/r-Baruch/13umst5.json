    "postText": "My friend is an english major and got an INC for one of her english classes. Since then, she completed the work and submitted it to the professor but has not received a grade for it. Now mind you, she told me that she didn't complete all of the work - she is wondering if the teacher can give her an FIN just for that. Still, she reached out and nothing. Who should she contact? It's urgent since she needs this course to do 3 eng courses in fall semester and complete her overall major on time for grad. What should she do?",

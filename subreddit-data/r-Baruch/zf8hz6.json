I've \n never been to the library I was planning on going there this upcoming semester because I have an extremely long gap one day and I was going to do all my homework and study in the gap.\n\n Has anyone complained to the school? In my old school they took the quiet library very seriously and the staff would give one warning and then ask you to leave if they had to do it again. \n\nAlso where else could I go to study that's quiet? I haven't been on campus for awhile and last time I was I just went to my classes and went home I didn't have and gaps.",

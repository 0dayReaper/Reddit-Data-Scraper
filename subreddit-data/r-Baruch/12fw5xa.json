    "postText": "Hi,\n\nMy name is Kyla and I am a grad student at CUNY- Hunter College in their \"Applied Digital Sociology\" program. I am taking a class called \"Sociology of the Gig Economy\" and am writing a research paper for this class.\n\nThis research paper intends to examine the impact on the social/emotional well-being of Latino/a/x/e adult gig workers who worked during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Anyone over the age of 18 is welcome to participate.\n\nIf you (or anyone you may know) is interested in participating, please click the link below to complete the short survey. This survey is completely anonymous and will not collect any identifying information.\n\n https://cunyhunter.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_cGrYCTyuK8MV8uG \n\nIf you have any questions/concerns, please contact me at [Kyla.Cortez43@myhunter.cuny.edu](mailto:Kyla.Cortez43@myhunter.cuny.edu).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",

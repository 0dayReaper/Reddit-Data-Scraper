This is a meeting SHE wanted to have, for a project due in MAY, and wanted everyone else in the group to accommodate her for, despite us already saying this meeting is too early. If this statement had come from another student I would be pissed but understanding. From her, no\n\nIf we can accommodate her, she should accommodate the class",

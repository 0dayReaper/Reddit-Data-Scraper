    "postText": "Hi everyone, first time posting here. I am a student at BMCC and have just been approved for an ePermit so i can take a Bilogy class at Baruch. I can see the class I want on CunyFirst but I need authorization from the Department Of Natural Sciences to sign up for the class. The class I want only has a few seats still open and I would like to register before its gone. The Baruch registrars office has been helpful and says I have to wait for the Department Of Natural Sciences.\n\nDoes anyone think it's a good idea to drop by personally to the Department Of Natural Sciences and speak to someone? Does anybody know what building and room number? I sent multiple e-mails and it has been weeks and I have still not gotten a response.",

    "postText": "Hi guys, I have a midterm soon for RES 3400 with Mitchell Ryan. The lectures are awful, and every class students raise their hands to tell him that they have no idea what's going on. Most of the students don't know how to even study for the midterm. I did hear his curves are crazy. Has anyone taken this class with Mitchell Ryan and how hard was the midterm?",

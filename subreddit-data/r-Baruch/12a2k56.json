It\u2019s nice to see a fellow Economics major here.\n\nBaruch is better for business oriented majors however, Hunter is still a great school. \n\nHunter is known for its Education and Science departments and many go there before applying to medical school. According to the department of Education, Econ majors at Hunter only make up 3.2% of the student body. \n\nMy recommendation is to wait to see if your top choice admits you. If you get two acceptances research the curriculums for both and see which one aligns more with your interests and professional goals.",

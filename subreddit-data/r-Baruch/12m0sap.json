If he/she allows it but after your first term (I think it\u2019s weird that it\u2019s unlikely), just enroll in your major classes (if you want to and can) and carry on. Just know that they might be considered elective classes, so see how many elective classes you have that you can take + classes part of the core curriculum. I say that because you need 12 credits under major+core+countable electives to be eligible for TAP.",

So if anybody knows who I can directly contact or what the process of doing so is like pls lmk lol.",

I hope she is a good contact, I attended an OCR workshop that she presented and I think she briefly mentioned something about dealing with bad employers so contacting her should get the ball rolling.\n\nThere\u2019s also this other link of contacts if interested \n\nhttps://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/starr-career-development-center/our-staff/",

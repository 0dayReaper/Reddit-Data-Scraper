I\u2019ve logged in everyday this week at 9 am and barely and appointments have opened up and the ones that have get taken up right away. I\u2019m so frustrated and really need to meet with an advisor and don\u2019t know what to do at this point.",

Planning before enrollment starts helps. Having an appointment before enrollment is easier and you can shoot quick emails to the academic advisor after enrollment for anything that came up.",

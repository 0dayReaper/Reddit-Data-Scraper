I want my final grades to know whether or not I can finally gtfo Baruch. But I'm also nerve-wracked about them.",

You literally have to contact the chair of the department they work in so the chairperson pressures the professor to post the grade sooner.  I've had to contact the chair for many of my classes so the chairperson talks to the professor to hurry up with the grades.",

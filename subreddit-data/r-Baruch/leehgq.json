Someone asked the professor if he will put exams from TB and if so where would they get the TB and if he's allowed to be in a unsupervised whatsapp group chat.\n\nGuys i cant make this up...i wish i could just blast this students name in this reddit post and have mass shaming for his stupidity",

Before college I though going to a private school was useless and way too expensive. Now, I think that high cost makes students motivated to work hard because they invest a lot more. I would like to see data on the GPA's of people at Baruch that pay full tuition vs those that study for free. I will say I see much less open complaining in higher level courses vs intro. I took BUS 1011 last semester and am taking FIN 3610 this semester. BUS was like high school, people drawing on the zoom slides and blowing up the chat. And FIN is much more professional.",

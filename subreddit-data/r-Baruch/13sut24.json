            "comment": "I took Jay for 3610&amp;4910. 4910 is harder w him bc he doesn\u2019t really teach from what I personally think, all the learning is on you. He takes attendance so definitely make sure you come but it\u2019s random sometimes he took it sometimes he didn\u2019t. He is strict on lateness in terms of assignments and in the beginning of the semester he gets upset if you show up late to class so try to get there in time. In terms of exams it\u2019s like everything you learn from his homework and quizzes so it\u2019s fair game. He curves when necessary ofc. \n\nThe class isn\u2019t bad if you have a good grasp of derivatives. I honestly enjoyed learning the material but getting an A involved me studying a week ahead for at least 4 hours a day\ud83d\ude29 but I\u2019m extra so yk",

            "comment": "Agree with the other commentor on everything that was said. FYI his commute is 3.5 hours and recently he got into a car crash so if your late you don't really have an excuse lol. Anyways idk if its the same right now but when I took Jay 3 sems back it was one day in person one day off(sometimes zoom) He asks polls on zoom(which are worth points for attendance and takes attendance randomly for both in person and zoom). 40% hw 5% attendance rest is split between 2 exams. Midterm was 20 questions mc and final was 30 questions mc and 4 short response questions with 3-4 subpart each (2 were definition based 2 were formula based) he allowed 1 sheet 1 sided for the midterm and 2 sheets 1 sided for final. I can give you my condensed formula sheet if anything(has legit everything including definitions lol its font 7 but readable, bolding and alphabetized.) But like the other commentator said if you don't study your ass off your not gonna do well, even with the formula sheet I made I studied 8 hours 5 days before exams, thankfully ended with a A- but he is nice.",

If you practice those questions, you should be fine.\n\nAlso, he's willing to provide help when you need it. I once asked him a lot of questions after class, and he patiently explained everything.\n\nTo succeed in his class, you do need to read the chapters and understand the concepts in the chapter. He will add on to the stuff you read in the chapters in his lectures. \n\nHe's a nice and patient professor. But he tries to finish things quickly during lectures as he wants to make sure he can teach those fucking 16 chapters on time.",

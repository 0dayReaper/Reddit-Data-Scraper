There is also a possibility you can get \"overbooked\" into a class (pretty sure that's not the right word) where the professor can allow an exception and let in more students than the limit allows for. Be sure to have a list of your preferred classes available should this opportunity arise.",

If you mean even the waitlists are full then add the class on coursicle and it should tell you when a class opens up (although it may take some time to process). However, if the waitlists are full then keep in mind your chance are pretty slim in getting in, especially if it\u2019s a popular course. They do open more classes in the middle of summer, and closer to the end of summer some people tend to drop, so keep an eye out and get on the waitlists! Good luck!",

    "postText": "Just finished freaking out. I don\u2019t think asking my prof to fail me will work. \n\nI\u2019m really scared for my GPA. Sure, it\u2019s not a major related class and I can omit my overall GPA on the resume but\u2026it\u2019s kinda fishy. Probably won\u2019t be allowed to retake the class either since I technically passed. \n\nDoes anyone know what I can do? Is it an option to major in something that will require taking calculus? Would that make it possible to retake the pre-calc since I\u2019d need at least a B?\n\nThank you!",

And if you did get an A in pre calc there would be zero record of it but you\u2019d get departmental permission to take regular calc",

Essentially you read a story given to you and come up with possible legal claims. That\u2019s all your grade is based on, attendance didn\u2019t seem to matter and he\u2019s quite lenient with grading. Readings are the case briefs and are not necessary if you attend the lectures and take notes. Expect him to miss half of the classes or moving them online due to personal reasons.",

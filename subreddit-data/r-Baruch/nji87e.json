Because of this many people fail to get into zicklin (failing calc 3 times it actually happens to people). If they want to get a \"business\" degree they will have to go to weissman and get a BA in economics which isn't the same as BBA in economics. the courses are different. \n3. Accounting is known as the best program at Baruch but the second most popular (finance is for the reason below). They have to make it hard and rigorous to ensure that people are actually \"learning\" (theres secretly test banks for this)\n4. You combine all 3 reasons, you get people just outright failing accounting courses where I believe that you need a C or something to take the next course. Due to this, people realized that their dream of being an accountant is over the moment they get below a C in the likes of ACC 3100 and 3200.\n\nFinance is the most popular major at Baruch for the simple reason: accounting is too hard and they can use the ACC 3100 and 3200 credit for the BBA finance degree.",

Even though they don\u2019t focus on that specific major. I\u2019m currently at a CC but I\u2019m debating on which 4 year college to transfer to for accounting. Baruch seems more difficult because of the grading curve that you mentioned",

    "postText": "i\u2019m pretty sure i failed a class from the grades i\u2019ve seen handed back to me and my final work. my professor hasn\u2019t entered any grades for me in the class though and it\u2019s just a dash - on blackboard. i have gotten A\u2019s on a few assignments but i know it wasn\u2019t enough to pass but i still thought those grades would be entered to show i even took the class. i\u2019m a freshman, i\u2019m wondering if that means i was dropped from the course or because i didn\u2019t pass they simply didn\u2019t enter grades anyway for me ? is it normal for a professor to go the whole semester not entering grades for you ?",

Some professors, don't put the final grade on BlackBoard, as they consider it a waste of their time. They put it in CUNYFirst.",

    "postText": "Im thinking of applying to Macaulay Honors next year. However, the application process isn\u2019t tied with Naviance. Has anyone ever just asked a teacher for a letter of recommendation and just applied the same one to both naviance and Macaulay. I was thinking of asking 4 different teachers for 4 long recs, but the process seems tedious. In addition, I\u2019m thinking of majoring in pre dental. I was thinking of Hunter because it\u2019s known for its med program, but after reading some posts, I think Baruch might be a better fit. Any advice?",

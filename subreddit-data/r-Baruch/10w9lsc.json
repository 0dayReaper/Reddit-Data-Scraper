    "postText": "This will definitely offend a few of you here. But if the shoe fits, it fits. \n\nWhy do some of you guys think you\u2019re better than everyone else just because you\u2019re in a fund management group? Some of you are really intelligent, I won\u2019t lie but does it hurt to be humble? \n\nI know multiple people who\u2019ve had experiences with \u201cfinance bros\u201d or \u201ccrypto bros\u201d but my thing is, there\u2019s obviously an overwhelming amount of them at Baruch and I just hate it. Every semester I encounter like five of them. \n\nNo one dislikes you for being successful or what not, it\u2019s your arrogance that affects everything. I actually find those who start early to build their careers quite admirable. \n\nDuring a class, when a professor asks a simple question, why do you go out of your way to overcomplicate and fuel your ego? To the point that the professor tells you to calm down. \n\nIn one of my classes, this dude (very loudly) began bragging about his GPA and how easy the class is to other classmates. Like good for you? Stop being disruptive. \n\nSome of you need to understand that you\u2019re not better than anyone else and you are not more than a Baruch student like the rest of us. \n\nI genuinely want to ask, why do you act like that? Are some of you just painfully unaware of your arrogant tendencies or what? \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t really care if you\u2019re in the replies cursing at me because to be honest, that means some of y\u2019all are just irredeemable. \n\nIf you\u2019re a finance bro or zicklin student who isn\u2019t like this, we love you and this doesn\u2019t apply to you. Keep up the good work. \n\nIf you behave like this, please evaluate yourself a little. \n\nBye.",

I have been in conversations where I know a couple of kids making fun of other people that could not get into Zicklin and whining about how much they hate transfer students.  Also, I know some kids that act as if it is the hunger games. The funny thing is that most of them do not intern anywhere with any \"clout\", I work at an F500 company, and all the other kids that I know that also work/intern for big companies are pretty humble dudes that will help you out if you ask them.",

I just think people take themselves too seriously it is not a competition, it is sad you have to say kudos for being a decent person. \n\nSide Note: They hate transfers because the common belief is that they just end up bringing the class down with them and they just end up failing the courses. They hate people that come from community schools to Baruch.",

There\u2019s so many factors that contribute to why someone is the way they are, with the typical response being \u201ctheir childhood\u201d, \u201cthe environment they grew up\u201d, \u201ctheir parents didn\u2019t love them enough\u201d, etc.\n\nBut IMO, two things I think are critical to explain someone\u2019s attitude (at least for college kids) are their philosophy on life, and their level of insecurity. \n\nWell first, I wanna say only about 50% of college students even ponder about their philosophy on life (source: my ass), thus many of these Zicklin ppl probably haven\u2019t even devoted meaningful thought to ethics and morality (this is me included lol). Of course, one doesn\u2019t ***need*** to read up on ethics and morality to not be a dick, but it certainly helps IMO.\n\nOn the topic of insecurity, I\u2019m sure a majority of college students in general are very insecure about something \u2014 whether that be their intelligence, physical appearance, physique, hygiene, academic success, laziness, addictions, etc. the list is endless. \n\nIt goes w/o saying that how you view your insecurities can really mess up your mental state, which in turn influences how you interact with other ppl. I can go into my own personal experience with my insecurities and how it had a tremendously negative impact on my life but I\u2019ve made this comment 100x longer than I thought I would lol.",

These people watched movies like, \"Wolf of Wall-Street\", and think that's how they should act. As if they're superior to others.\n2. The culture in the finance major and any of the finance programs has a decent amount of people that love to shit-talk other majors. Not all finance majors, but enough that it's common. This makes new finance major students that are easily influenced by social stuff to follow in their predecessor's footsteps and act as you describe.\n3. It may also be due to social media and these posts from these business accounts that keep claiming that Finance/Accounting is more useful and superior than any other major. That any other major will lead to you being broke and useless. So they feel superior by doing a \"precious major\". What must be understood is that it's not just about the major that you are taking but the work that you put into everything in general. I joined a job program where I learned that there was this business communications person that became a CFO for a company. I had a mentor who was a psychology major who became a business analyst. But many of the young finance major students don't get this. They think they're set with what they already got.\n4. The finance field is weird socially in general.",

I definitely got to understand why they behave like this a little more now. \n\nIt\u2019s not shocking that young college students (especially men) watch these movies and think they\u2019re the protagonist of a film, while, others are just lesser beings they can stand on to get to success. I guess they will be brought to reality once they enter the workforce. \n\n I knew accounting and finance majors shit on others, but I didn\u2019t know to what extent. As a non-finance and non-accounting major, I feel like some of them don\u2019t consider my major to be a field that requires hard work. Finance is versatile and a field that cannot be \u201cgate-keeped\u201d as you mentioned, people can move from psych to banking. \n\nI also stated in one of my responses that these finance majors most likely don\u2019t feel validated and that\u2019s why, when they join one of the fund management clubs at Baruch, they get hyped up by upper-class man and start thinking they\u2019re the shit. \n\nIt\u2019s saddening that their arrogance and lack of consideration makes it difficult to feel comfortable at the school.",

I hope most of them can redeem themselves. \n\nIf you do not mind and time allows, are you able to share about how the part-time/evening MBA program is like? I\u2019m quite interested in pursuing a part-time MBA after undergrad, because I have to work while attending.",

                            "comment": "Sure: There are six classes of \"foundational courses\" that are standard across MBA programs: statistics, microeconomics, strategy/competitive advantage, industrial psychology, etc. You also have to pick three out of six \"functional courses\" from accounting, corporate finance, innovation, IT systems management, marketing, and operations. You round out the program with electives and a one-semester capstone practicum where you consult for a company.\n\nEvening MBA students' backstories and reasons vary widely for entering the program: I myself am prepping for a mid-career change; others want to take their current careers to the next level; and others it's apparent that they're using the program as a conduit to a US visa (which I'm completely fine with, btw.) This being said, people's skill levels vary widely from impressive to \"how the hell did you get through HS, much less into grad school?\" I've been in group projects with \\*native English speakers\\* who are barely able to string a sentence together, much less write a cogent paper. Someone in my international business class legit said that \"Google was the first search engine\" and \"Germany doesn't border water.\" I really regret not responding to him, \"Ask Jeeves about the Baltic Sea.\"\n\nThis all being said, you get from the program what you put into it and given its prestige, it's a true bargain with NY in-state tuition.",

Let you use cheat sheet. \n\nLaw \u2014&gt; Garnica Garcia. When the semester is about to end and finals are coming up, there would be 3 days of fun aka extra credit in playing games with teams. I don\u2019t know if he is doing the same when I took him, but let us use cheat sheet on midter (I think) and definitely let us use it on the final.",

Reading slides aloud over zoom, him giving his analogies to explain the law, oh and his sarcasm. Yes he gives plenty of extra credit but his teaching style wasn\u2019t a good fit for me. He skims the info, I\u2019d rather have a better understanding of the laws than to just dumb it all down to pass a test. Exams were all essay based., the midterm had a few terms to test which he allows an index, so it\u2019s essentially open book. Same for the final if it\u2019s online. I took an online class and up til the last week he freaked us out saying the final would be in person, then switched it up and changed the entire thing to an online final, but then we had to be on zoom for 3 hours in a Monday morning. Some may like his watered down teaching g approach but as someone who\u2019s studying law, he was not for me.",

If you get the chance to take him for Macro Honours, do it.\n\nLaw 1101 - Gabriel Garnica, I just took him this semester and I loved his class.  He gave one memo assignment with detailed instructions (he planned to give another and decided to drop it) and one revision which equated to 20 points.  One class before the end was dedicated to a team extra credit assignment that ranged from 1 to 7 points yhat could be earned.  He also reviewed for the midterm and the final with us.",

No one really talks about her but I took her my first semester as a transfer into Baruch and I haven\u2019t met a professor I\u2019ve liked as much as her since, and it\u2019s been my favorite class in years. She is so passionate on the subject and made the class so much easier to learn, and all the readings and hws are pretty easy to do. Her slides also help so much, especially for the final. She\u2019s also really understanding so if you need extra time for anything she\u2019ll probably be nice enough to extend it! She did this for us for the one group project we had to do. For the midterm it was take home and she even encouraged us to speak to each other and discuss the cases. She always says she wants us to succeed and wants to give us all A\u2019s and it definitely shows. I wish I could take her again, but she sadly only teaches this class.\n\nAlso P.S. something I don\u2019t wanna say fully online just in case, but she\u2019s really good to take for the final especially if she\u2019s the only person in your room!",

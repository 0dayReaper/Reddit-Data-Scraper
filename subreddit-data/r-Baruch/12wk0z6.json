Regarding internships, they definitely are available. However, you need to take initiative and find them utilizing handshake, LinkedIn, the websites of your desired employers, and by networking. Internships won't just appear out of nowhere, so just keep that in mind. You will have to work for it, but it's definitely possible!",

On quizzes/exams, which are all open-book, he drops the questions no one gets and curves final grade. It was a little hard to see and hear what he was doing so try to sit closer to the front.\n\nMKT 3000 - I took this asynchronously, so it may be different for you, but a very chill class. Tests and assignments are straightforward.",

    "postText": "If you travel up to the seventh floor of Baruch's Field Building at 17 Lexington Avenue, you'll notice something unlike any other floor in the building. A long hallway leading down to a pair of locked doors on the building's south side. Take a peek through the opening and you might be able to make out the giant well-lit open space and scoreboard hiding on the other side.\n\nSo... what is it?\n\nThe answer can be found one floor down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[So much for keeping that door closed...](https://preview.redd.it/icl462us73041.jpg?width=2016&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4e14e6d8f32442a5797c52ca94f251de24397565)\n\nFor more than 70 years, 17 Lex was the hub for all academic, extracurricular, and recreational activities that took place at Baruch College. As a result the building had a little bit of everything: a library, cafeteria, club rooms, lounges, and even a swimming pool on the first floor. And wedged between the sixth and seventh floors was the gymnasium for the then-known \"City College School of Business and Civic Administration.\" The gym was used as a practice facility for the C.C.N.Y. Beavers, the premier collegiate basketball team in the nation around the middle of the 20th century (and the Division I national champions in 1950).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The gymnasium's better years.](https://preview.redd.it/4ss4y6e2c3041.jpg?width=2016&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=becc0a8c71122b94e864dc0fc00fcac676e6f698)\n\nUpon spinning off from City College and becoming a separate CUNY institution in 1968, the court became home to the Baruch College Statesman basketball team. After four years at the gym it became clear that facility was not suitable even for Division III basketball and in 1972 the team began a 30 year exodus bouncing between the 69th Regiment Armory on 25th Street and the Xavier High School Gym on 16th Street. When both facilities were unavailable the team would be forced to play at whatever other space was available in the area.\n\nUpon the completion of the Vertical Campus in 2001, almost all of Baruch's activities moved to the new state-of-the-art building. This included the school's athletic program, and the newly renamed Bearcats finally had a place to call home. The 6th floor gym was mostly forgotten. At some point prior to the beginning of the Field Building's renovation the gym was \"closed for maintenance\" and has never reopened.\n\nThe 7th floor doors leading to the gym's balcony seats are almost always locked, but on this particular day, the handle turned all the way and the door creaked open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9gozgzyl3041.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cfaf71a2c7ab9734b360d62ec67bbf565f777193\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, the gym is a graveyard of chairs, 1970's color scheme desks, chalkboards, window AC Units, other assorted office supplies, and even a refrigerator.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdlkumztm3041.jpg?width=1846&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f6e1cfe062b95c7c8893f970d2c28e5f1627d5ff\n\nIt would also appear that the court has played host to its final pickup game.\n\nAs part of the renovation of 17 Lex, the sixth floor gym is set to be demolished and replaced with two large lecture hall at some point in the coming years.\n\nIn the meantime, in a city where every inch of recreational space is in high demand, Baruch's hidden basketball court will be shunned by the institution it was meant to serve, just as it has been for the past 50 years.",

I\u2019m not sure when or why they stopped, but I\u2019d imagine it had to do with the renovation and that organizations would rather shell out the extra money to rent the gyms at the NVC than the decrepit one on the sixth floor of 17 Lex.\n\nAnd they have repurposed it. Unfortunately, they repurposed it into a giant, well-lit storage closet.",

Unfortunately, in its current state its a pretty miserable place to have class in, and understandably most students won't be able to look past that. But it really is astounding that it was the hub for all things Baruch for a majority of the school's history.\n\nAs for the swimming pool, sadly it is now a thing of the past. It was one of the first things that was demolished when the renovation began in order to make room for a new set of elevators in the new lobby.",

We used to play there 2-3 times a week when the doors would be open) until security caught us and told us that we weren't allowed to be there. Nonetheless, that didn't stop us from playing. It's a shame what they've done to it. A beautiful court like that should be preserved and used for its purpose, not be hidden and used as a storage space for a bunch of old &amp; worn out chairs.",

Up the ladder and you're own the highest roof of the 17 Lex, breathtaking and dizzying experience since that part of the roof is extremely small, so it was like being in a little sail boat. Used to go up there early fall and late spring and read until they locked up the room that leads there.",

I'm starting to think and look for internships but its very hard applying because there are so many platforms and positions out there and i don't know which one is the right one for me. and most importantly i don't want to waste my time applying to any not so useful internships either. So if any of you majored in fiance and have landed some good internships, please guide on the process such as where to apply, what positions, companies etc. thank you!!!!",

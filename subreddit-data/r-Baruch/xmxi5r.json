    "postText": "I finished an internship at a wall street firm this summer and I think I want to share how I did it. \n\n- My background and reason my GPA is 2.5. \n\nMy major is CIS data analytics track and minor is Mathematics. \nLong story short I got severely depress during late 2020 and early 2021 so I tanked my gpa to 2.5. \n- How I got my internship.\n\n\nPrior to my wall street internship I did some small internships provide from CUNY Resources. \nI looked into all internship opportunities that CUNY have that could possibly apply to my field of interest. I highly recommend Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP). It did help me to form project and worked on it through out summer. \nThe second program I recommend is Break Through Tech Sprinternship. It is a short internship through out winter break and it was super fun and collaborative after this internship I was able to reapply to the firm that chose me during sprinternship and came back to intern for them during summer as well as the experienced land me quite a lot of interviews from various different companies a long with internship offers. \n- Resume \n\nI did very generic work for resume that I bring it to the career center and editted it as well as bring it to people in the field I want to apply to to get feedback. \n\n- Applying process \n\nMostly I apply for all the internship I saw on linkedin and similar job search website nothing much tbh \ud83d\ude2c. \n\n- Networking \n\nTbh I did not networking much apart from with recruiters from career fair and the rest tbh I was so bad at networking like I sent the cold call messages and close my laptop with anxious thought and pray they don't answer me \ud83d\ude43. \n\n- Interview Prep \n\nI wrote down a doc of around 15 to 30 interview questions and answers for these questions for behavioral questions I suggest bring the doc to career center for editing for technical questions for data analytics and similar position I check on github and stackoverflow and material learned from classes. ( yes knowledge from cis classes did apply to answer interview questions)\nPlease let me know if you want to know anything else. I'm here to help.\n\nEdit1: last things I feel like is super important is to do as many mock interviews session as possible I find that do mock interviews with people that work in the industry you want to be in is the most effective. Good luck y'all.",

For behavioral they mostly ask questions like: \"tell me about yourself\" \"what is your most favorite class\" it were generic behavioral interview questions.  But if you want more info just DM me.",

I prefer paper towels over the dryer; I alway think about the study conducted on driers that suggested that they blow out fecal matter. I honestly thought it was a way for them to save money, which sucks. \n\nI do not want to wash my hands and have hundreds of individuals fecal matter on my hands. It\u2019s gross. \n\nStart a petition, post flyer for the link in each bathroom.  I\u2019ll sign it \ud83d\ude02.",

The only part I\u2019m confused about is if we for example, use any of our aid(whether that\u2019ll be grants, scholarships, FAFSA) it\u2019ll reduce the amount of aid we get during the fall and spring term? Since summer is considered its own term. If that\u2019s the case then is it really worth it using your aid instead of actually paying? Idk\u2026",

I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll reduce, I\u2019m currently waiting for financial office in getting back to me. However, last summer I did not receive any financial aid and paid out of pocket while my exelcisor scholarship covers my fall and spring semesters almost full",

The summer term has its own Pell grant so you future grants won\u2019t be reduced unlike TAP on the other hand. If you request to receive TAP during the summer term then your future semesters TAP will be reduced and you\u2019ll have to pay out of pocket to fulfill the remaining amount.",

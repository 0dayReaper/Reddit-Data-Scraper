It\u2019s getting ridiculous at this point where people  keep spamming and asking when is a midterm in the group chat when it\u2019s all on blackboard/syllabus.",

            "comment": "there will always be people asking about things you can find on the syllabus. why are you concerned about their \u201cnon-sensical\u201d questions? whatsapp group chats can often get you an answer quicker then logging into blackboard, selecting the syllabus, and scrolling down for dates. maybe they didn\u2019t want to download the syllabus document. it\u2019s lazy, but the entire purpose of whatsapp group chats is to help with the class (not just homework help or topic help). if you don\u2019t like lazy people, you mind as well make a private and separate whatsapp chat for the class with like-minded people. \n\ni really don\u2019t understand why you guys are annoyed by \u201clazy\u201d people with \u201cnon-sensical\u201d questions. make a different whatsapp chat and stop complaining about it.\n\nthe reason that I am explaining my point so much is because I would rather people promote an environment where you can ask any question, it\u2019s convenient and most importantly, it helps. When a question gets repeated, it helps. When it comes to career responsibility, people will be forced to remember things on their own but this is school. Get over it.\n\n*** If you don\u2019t like \u201clazy\u201d and \u201cnon-sensical\u201d questions, don\u2019t answer them. It\u2019s as simple as that.",

You won\u2019t survive long if you\u2019re just book smart but aren\u2019t a good worker because you need simple things explained to you all the time. In real life, people look down on those that can\u2019t put in a little bit of effort to do very simple things like checking the syllabus. It\u2019s beyond stupid to want to nurture that behavior",

    "postText": "The problem is that I want to take both of these classes. I want to take ECO4200 with professor Norman Kleinberg but that class is at the same time as the only ECO4093 class offered this semester. \n\nSo my question is how is Anthony Karydakis for ECO4200? I am taking prof Norman this semester and I love him. Should I take prof Anthony next semester (even tho I want to stick with prof. Norman) so I can take both ECO4200 and ECO4093? \nOr should I just take ECO4200 with prof Norman because I know it will be a fun class? \n\nFor reference I am a senior and this is the only semester I can take either or both classes. \n\nHelp would be greatly appreciated!",

If you apply to SWE internships, and you have a finance major on your resume with no past SWE experience or related projects, your resume going to get tossed faster than you got accepted to baruch.",

I decided to minor in CS, which gave me the option of taking Data Structures &amp; Algorithm\u2019s, Discrete Math, and Intro to Programming which gives you a very strong base for a non CS major. I\u2019m planning to apply to grad school for CS, a lot of schools don\u2019t require a CS degree if you\u2019ve taken the prerequisite courses they\u2019re looking for, and you can knock most of them down at Baruch as a CS minor.",

Unless you did some sort of programming in your previous tech consulting job, the experience doesn\u2019t really help you out that much. But once again, experience in something tech-related is better than no experience at all",

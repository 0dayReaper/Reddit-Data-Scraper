    "postText": "Hi so I chose to attend Hunter College and I honestly was just being lazy and did little research and only chose it because it was close to my home. I\u2019ve recently started doing research and realized Hunter is terrible for what I want to major in and in general don\u2019t want to go there at all. I haven\u2019t even scheduled classes yet but was wondering when/how I can apply to transfer? Thank you",

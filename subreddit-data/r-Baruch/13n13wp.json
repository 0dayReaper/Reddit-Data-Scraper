President Wu closes the ceremony congratulating you  &amp; confetti rains down the Barclay Center. You do NOT walk the stage, you do NOT get your name called and you do NOT get your diploma during that time.",

I recall another poster stating it was because we have such a large graduating class. I\u2019m not sure that is the main factor but could be a contributing one. They should let us walk.\n\nUSG should get to the bottom of it, \ud83d\ude02",

Neither we get to walk on the stage, they should at least consider using the screens to show our names, degree, and pictures while we listen patiently for those who we have been listening to for the past 4+ years.",

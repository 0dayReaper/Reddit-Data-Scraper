I had to fight sleep bc I had his 9am class.\n\nHe really focuses on participation. You'll have to print out every reading (over 20 pages back and front) that you'll use once or twice. He's fussy about lateness even though he's late most of the time. \nAs long as you do well on the written assignments you'll be fine.\n\nEdit: to add, he hates technology which is why you have to print everything",

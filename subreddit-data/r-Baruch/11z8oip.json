I chose yes but I am really in between right now.\nI say yes because of my friends and playing video games, basically just dopamine from my hobbies. Hobbies that I can\u2019t just sit down and do anymore without getting ridiculed or personally feeling guilty afterwards for not doing something \u201cscholarly\u201d.\n\nWith exams coming up, I feel confident on most, but my most recent one I did horribly and the class average was failing as well. I just feel like I won\u2019t be able to keep up. My gpa isn\u2019t good from my last semester (it was my first sem). I just want to build it, and it makes me feel anxious. \n\nMaybe now that I am writing this I should\u2019ve said \u201cNo\u201d, but I\u2019m trying to make the best of it. Studying, talking to people, and playing AC:NH again like I did in the pandemic makes me feel better despite how shit I feel.  \n\nThanks for reading and have a good day. \ud83d\udc9b",

Im fortunate to have friends and family to emotionally support me and I already work so that takes some of pressure of finding a job after school off my back. I think if i were handling all this stress right out of highschool all alone i would be scrambling. Im also in therapy which has been really helpful in managing the stress and anxiety of school.",

I know I should be excited because I will be graduating but idk why it makes me more anxious. Zicklin is very competitive and makes me feel worthless even though I am trying very hard. \n\nI also have not made any friends here. Even though I make friends they only keep in touch throughout the semester. Once the semester ends, they are gone too. \n\nAnyways, I hope everyone finds happiness and succeeds!!",

I suffer from mental illnesses, and she completely invaded my personal space by touching and using my belongings, such as my towels and bed. She heightened my anxiety, and on top of that, living in the city completely depleted my self confidence. It\u2019s weird. I love the city, but at the same time I find myself comparing to so many kids around my age and they dress so cool, seem to have so many friends, and I just feel like I\u2019m an outsider. :/",

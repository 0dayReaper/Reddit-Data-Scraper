I think for Fall 2023 it will be Prof. Rados Radoicic.\n\nHe used this book a few years ago: A Walk Through Combinatorics, Author:Miklos Bona, Publisher: WSPC 4th Edition Year 2016.\n\nBut that might have been updated.\n\nYou can see Prof. Matic's resources for the combinatorics course on this page:\nhttps://imomath.com/bmath/index.cgi?page=m4150M\n\nSome of his recommended textbooks are free on-line.",

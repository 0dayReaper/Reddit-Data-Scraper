    "postText": "Prior to Baruch, I took a course that met the requirements for  Scientific World and now I just need to take a lab to meet the requirement for  Life and Physical Sciences. Can anyone who has been in that situation before and done it tell me if it's doable to only take the lab without any lecture? If so did you have to do outside study to do well in the course? Also, what is the grade breakdown of the lab course is it only graded on lab work or is there a midterm and final exam? Also which lab is an easy workload? Is it the env course?",

The labs weren\u2019t too hard neither too easy. The grade mostly consisted of the labs, one mid and one final and this presentation we had to work in. Mine was totally online so an in-person might have more projects to it. But overall it was an easy A.",

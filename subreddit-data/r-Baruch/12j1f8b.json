Some people commute from Long Island or Staten Island!\n\nYou might have better luck posting in subs for colleges where most people are from out of town; say NYU, the New School, or Cooper Union, which are all nearby. This being said, your budget is on the low end for the neighborhoods you listed, which are among the most expensive in the city. Consider neighborhoods in the boroughs that are on the NRW for an easy commute to Flatiron or at least the UES or UWS.",

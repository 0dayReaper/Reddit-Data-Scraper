    "postText": "So, I now realize why people post here asking about different instructors. RMP is kind of useless, as I've just visited for the first time and could not disagree more with some of these people's ratings. I don't know if I should even ask anyone else's opinion or just continue to roll the dice. Does anyone have any tips on vetting teachers?",

Overall, it should take less than an hour to check everything, and if you're lazy, then take the dice and hope for a good roll.\n\nAlso check their syllabus as most are avaliable with a quick Google search, also check old end of semester  surveys as useless as they are sometimes they help\n\nOh also check the discord server, don't be rude tho",

I had one professor with a bunch of bad reviews, but rmp gave him a 5.5. I don\u2019t know how that is possible, since it\u2019s a 1-5 ratio.

So, it\u2019s really important to choose wisely.\n\nThe only way to see if it\u2019s a good professor is to check everything, reddit, the evaluations, and rmp. Then make a decision based on all the info. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to post on reddit with questions about them, and pm people with specific questions. Worst case they don\u2019t answer.",

There were several incidents including one with me after I tried to advocate for myself and she went off telling me to be quiet. To make a long story short. She was giving grades in exchange for favorable reviews. By this time the students were communicating on a chat so we all knew what was going on. The students she approached to do this decided not to take her deal. She actually have one student a lesser grade for not doing this. I plan on posting about this because the Deans, Advisors, the Chair of the language department received complaints and did absolutely nothing because of the Union. I say all of this to say don't trust RMP. Ask people for their opinions and experiences.",

The reviews certainly don't lie and you can filter out the one student that was upset they failed because they never showed up and barely did anything. I don't know about you but in texas we have a 6 drop rule so rate my prof is ESSSENTIAL to having a higher percent of exceeding. Those who tell you not to use rmp is definitely a professor 100%. USE IT\n\n1. You are paying A LOT of money for it, you are not choosing, you are paying for that professor\n2. Getting a bad professor could increase your chances of a lower GPA and a bunch of bullsht (academic suspension) if they fck with your grades\n3. Some professors do not care or aren't influential at all making the class boring and could kill your inspiration.\n\nBeware I have been seeing professors create fake reviews on rmp, even they care about that website.

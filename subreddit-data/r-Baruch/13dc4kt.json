However, I\u2019m curious as to what the minimum is in Baruch? Will I be able to get by if I only take 12 credits per semester as I am now?\n\nPS. I am diagnosed with ADHD so I am choosing my mental and physical well-being over anything else.",

I also did 4 classes  on reg semester and then 1 or 2 during summer cause I feel that summer is too long even if you have internships you loose the feel of school and are lazy as the semester starts.",

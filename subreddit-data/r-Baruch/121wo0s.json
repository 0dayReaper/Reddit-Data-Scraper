Highly recommend, no hw, and no slides just class discussion and papers midterm and final. \n\nI took Hany for eco 4000 and had to drop because he went way too deep into math proofs for the course. Granted, not sure his approach to this class given it\u2019s macro. He\u2019s a nice guy tho and super willing to help his students.",

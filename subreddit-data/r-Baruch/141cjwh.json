Good point about an email like that coming from a student email address as being a red flag.",

Then he asked for weird things like a screen shot of the deposit (I of course blocked the account info when sending him this). After that things got rotten fast (good thing!)\nHe kept asking me to pay some \u201csales rep\u201d from amazon (in order to expedite processing and shipping), while the check was pending (PS it is a fake check that will never clear!). \nThe point is you applepay one of his associates pretending to be the sales rep while the check is pending\u2026 and only after 3 days when they reject the check, you would be screwed for $2,500!",

    "postText": "So, at the beginning of the year, on a different account I put out a post saying if anyone wanted an access code to X class I got it, due to McGraw Hill sending me an extra one by accident. This code still worked and was unopened and unscratched. Currently, I am a senior I work in an internship that pays me pretty well, but I thought to myself why don't I just give this away for an extreme discount rather than free? I didn't give it for free because we as humans do not appreciate things that are just given to us for nothing, so I charged 20 dollars for a 100-dollar code. An 80% mark down even though I could have sold it to a third-party college prep store for 50 dollars because it was unused but I wanted to help out my fellow peers. So the day came when I had to give the code, I told the kid \"If it doesnt work, do not pay me\", a day later he messaged me and said it worked and was thankful about it and told me to wait a week before accepting payment which I did because I didn't care about the money. So a month goes by and I message him, the day after he deletes his Reddit account and vanishes off Reddit. Hey, a\\*\\* h\\*\\*\\*\\*, I didn't even care about the money but the principle of not being a dick head is something you never learned of. I gave you something at an extreme mark down because I thought I was doing you a favor. Remember karma is a bitch and to my fellow Baruch peers if you going to sell anything get the money upfront. Sometimes people take kindness as a weakness, and he is lucky I dont report him because I figured out what room his class is in and if I wanted to be petty I could inform the deans and I do have the receipts to prove I bought the code but I won't or will I?\n\n\\*15 UP VOTES AND I LEAK THE MESSAGES (I WONT REVEAL ANY PERSONAL INFROMATION, FOR HIS SAFETY)",

    "postText": "As I was boarding the train, this man went up to me and put his head against my head. He used his hand and put it at the back of my head so his head and my head bumped. He did this twice. He whispered to me \u201cI can knock you out right now but don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t.\u201d He then asked me for money by telling me that he\u2019s doing a fundraiser. It seems like he did the same with the other folks on the train because right after, he pointed to the man next to me and said he \u201cdonated\u201d $20. Things happened so quickly that I didn\u2019t have time to process what just happened. I was so terrified that I opened my wallet and gave him a dollar. I don\u2019t typically carry cash but this was just some change from when i went to Chinatown. He saw that I only had 3 dollars and told me that I should give him one more dollar. I told him I needed it to buy lunch. He touched my head once last time and moved onto the next cart. After that, another man, who I assume was with him walked into the next cart. \n \nStill in shock. My hands are still shaking. \n\nNote: this happened about an hour ago on the 6 train at Canal. Train was not packed but there were a few people, including little kids. \n\nStay safe everyone.",

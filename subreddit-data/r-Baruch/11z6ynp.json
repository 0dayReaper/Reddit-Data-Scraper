I had a solid background in statistics and physics so OPM came easier to me and FIN felt like a weed out class to me (super hard for no reason later fin classes [perhaps it was bc I took it (fin300) during covid online] made things easier to understand). To me, OPM was easier. I had some accounting majors tell me the same they sort of compared it to cost accounting (not at all the same but some small aspects here and there).",

I disagree from my experience, but everyone has had different professors so it\u2019s really all up to the professor imo. As for FIN 3000 imo it was harder than my 4710 and 4610 class im taking right now. Literally a professor can make or break your semester in terms of Grade / Effort ratio.",

    "postText": "I would like to reiterate that this post is not in any way intended as humor or satire. My wallet and I are completely serious about this endeavour. My offer is exactly what the post title says. We meet up, we hold hands for a few minutes, I transfer the money and then leave. I will try not to get any tears or snot on you or say anything that is overly self-pitying. I am a relatively clean and normal-looking person, and I am willing to wash my hands again in front of you if that would make you more comfortable. Thanks for reading, and please PM me if you are interested. Go Bearcats.",

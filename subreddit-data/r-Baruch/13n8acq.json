Join some clubs or a frat, doesn't matter if it's catered toward advancing your career or just something you're interested in. The fall semester is the best time to make new friends because of the incoming students and the club fair!!! Put yourself out there. It took me till the spring semester to realize that going to class isn't a solid way to make close friends.",

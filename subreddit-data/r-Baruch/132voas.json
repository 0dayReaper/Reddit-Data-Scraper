I believe the DSP scholarship is only for tuition so it will not cover the cost of dorms. I would apply for the Excelsior scholarship in addition to the DSP scholarship. (If you have more questions about the DSP scholarship, you can ask at the DSP freshman orientation.)",

Try to do your own research instead of believing what anonymous strangers on Reddit tell you. \n\nRegarding your question: short answer is no. \n\n\u2018The Dean's Scholars Program provides students with a full-time, in-state tuition scholarship (up to 8 consecutive semesters) after all other grants and gift aid have been applied. Awards are applicable exclusively to the fall and spring semesters only.\u2019\n\nThis is a tuition (goes towards tuition) scholarship and applies after your other grants (I would think including Excelsior too) already applied. \n\nSource: https://baruch-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/fees-expenses-and-financial-aid/financial-aid-and-award/deans-scholars-program",

            "comment": "There really aren\u2019t that many biological science majors at Baruch. If you choose to go with this major, I suggest double majoring in something like economics. It might be a weird combination, but economics is always a good backup plan. It\u2019ll be a lot of grunt work, but you have something to atleast fall back on. For sure hunter will be better for biology. Generally, hunter is better for anything medical related, CCNY is better for anything engineering related, Baruch is good for anything business or math related, and queens college is well rounded for everything.",

If there\u2019s any specific biology classes you wanna take that baruch doesn\u2019t offer, you can always epermit it.",

What I hear about majoring in science at Hunter is quite different.",

The Biological science field is very competitive due to the hoards of graduates that come out each year . Industry and acidemia cant create enough jobs for all these graduates. Its gotten so bad that even those with masters in biology are having a tough time. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 70% of all biology graduates have at least a masters degree right now... ( let that sink in) but only 49% of them are actually working in their field of study! \n\n  \nsource: [https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market/index#/outcomes-by-major](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market/index#/outcomes-by-major)\n\nyou should also be aware that a BS in biology is also one of the least lucrative degrees to have even though its a science and part of the STEM majors. A great analysis done by the Foundation For Research and Equal Opportunity found that a whopping 31% of biology graduates will actually have a  NEGATIVE return on investment over the course of their 30 year careers compared to a High school graduate.   The analysis found that biology to be the 3rd worse degree in terms of a financial payout. only Art and Theology majors had worse outcomes. \n\nsource: [https://freopp.org/is-college-worth-it-a-comprehensive-return-on-investment-analysis-1b2ad17f84c8](https://freopp.org/is-college-worth-it-a-comprehensive-return-on-investment-analysis-1b2ad17f84c8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nzip recruiter also did a survey of college graduates and found that biology graduates are the 9th most regretful of their degrees (tied with English majors.)  A whopping 52% said they regretted this majors. Surprisingly biology was also the only science major in the top 10 .\n\nsource: https://www.ziprecruiter.com/blog/regret-free-college-majors/\n\n  \nIf you choose Bio make sure your 100% sure you'll be going to graduate school and are ok with the 50/50 odds of ending up not needing your masters degree afterwards. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ngood e luck.",

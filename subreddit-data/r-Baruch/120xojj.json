Tell me why the first advisor I went to was helping me map out my degree (long term planning) but fail to tell me that since I\u2019m going to take my last requirement to enter into Zicklin in the summer (macro), I\u2019m going to have to wait until June 26 to to register for my classes. The thought popped in head and if I wasn\u2019t curious enough I would\u2019ve tried to register for my business classes at 9:45 on Monday like an idiot. I\u2019m a freshman so I\u2019m new to this so has anyone ever had these problems? What classes do you guys suggest I enroll for because I literally have nothing left to take. By 6pm on June 26, all the good Acc professors that teach the classes will be filled up and I\u2019m either left with the shitty ones or all the seats will be filled. Im also worried about financial aid too \ud83e\udee5\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Leaving HS is very structured entering a senior college some expectations are that students also are active participants in their curriculum review not just completing courses that are needed but also learning to navigate all aspects of college life. I always strive to assist students in their journey but I also want students to learn the particular program policies for themselves so that we can have a reciprocal advising experience. This allows for you to ask targeted questions as well as the I will lead you to your path. We cannot be everything to everyone but I do know that I take my work very seriously with my students and I am fairly certain I give that information about checking the Zicklin website for any of my students who are taking their final courses in summer for Zicklin. I cannot unfortunately do everything some things will need to be done by the students so that you the student also become well versed in the policies and procedures. I do apologize if you felt misled but I am like 99.9% sure I mentioned checking the Zicklin website for the rules.",

They tend to open up more classes as the semester comes closer to starting and since you are a freshmen your schedule flexible, so you can take classes that are traditionally easier that a higher volume of classes. You\u2019ll be fine, do not worry about it.",

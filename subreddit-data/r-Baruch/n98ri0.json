If you don\u2019t want to take the vaccine because you are hesitant I get it and I\u2019m sorry that the rest of the world is trying to move on with them assuming they are completely safe. Yes getting it is *somewhat* risky but the longer we get from the start of the vaccine trials and the start of actual vaccinations, the safer it seems. I don\u2019t know of any side effects from getting the vaccine. I *do* know that there are a lot of people still suffering from long COVID and we have very little understanding of that still. Sure young people might not die if they get it but it can still affect your life and maybe permanently. I\u2019ve read too many long COVID horror stories. Some people who got it early last year still haven\u2019t recovered completely or still haven\u2019t gotten sense of smell or taste back. It\u2019s not something we can fuck around with and take a chance on. I trust the vaccine science. I do not trust people to be smart and stay COVID free on their own. As the number of vaccinations go up, the cases are dramatically shrinking. I\u2019m graduating from Baruch but I\u2019m glad that CUNY is implementing this.",

But it's turning around, and we're not reversing back when the infection rates spiked.

You call me anti-vaxx because i am against this one specific, rushed special-interest-pushed \"vaccine\", with no regard to how I feel about MMR or the polio vaccine (actual vaccines that meed the required guidelines which include *concluded clinical trials*)\n\nRemember when that Gardasil vaccine was recalled, even though it was marketed for years and years?  \n\nSorry for being able to think independently, and for being able to use historic data to support the \"my body my choice\" side. \n\n You are a fellow college student.  You know it is easy to find data to support **either** side of this argument **from credible sources**.  \n\nAlso, if you've ever taken marketing and critical thinking, you'd also understand that this vaccine BS has been nothing but a very successful ad campaign in modern history.",

The people who are vaccinated took it to protect themselves and others on campus. If you don\u2019t have the vaccine you\u2019re highly likely to spread the virus to other students. And if people who aren\u2019t vaccinated are still in public places and spread the virus, the pandemic will just be on for longer, which I assume you don\u2019t want :). You\u2019ll be considered a risk and you won\u2019t be allowed in public places. There are going to be a lot of other things that are going to be open to people who are only vaccinated.",

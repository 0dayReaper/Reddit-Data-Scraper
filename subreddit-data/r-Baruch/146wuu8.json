Class starts at June 12th which is tomorrow and I'm on position 4 of the waitlist even though there's plenty of open positions. Does anyone know what I should do here? I tried scheduling a meeting with an advisor but there was no availability.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xarzxv7qpe5b1.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=eaaf8df8ea14b8354713a44d2233f1add29c14ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7tga17wmpe5b1.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=842786f66646166b42047fe089f87e5b8599b239",

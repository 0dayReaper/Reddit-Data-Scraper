I doubt it\u2019s an accreditation issue since there are plenty of reputable universities in state that offer fully online degrees at all levels. Any institution that doesn\u2019t offer a healthy balance, or at least one or two sections of online/hybrid at this point is simply choosing not to. \n\nBaruch pushing for in-person courses only comes down to 2 things: 1. It\u2019s part of CUNY (aka the government) 2. CUNY needs all the money they can get from you.",

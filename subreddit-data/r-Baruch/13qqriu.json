If I was you, I would take micro only in the summer just because I believe the exam isn\u2019t departmental so the exam might be a little easier",

I did not even study in between classes, I only did the homework's assigned over the weekends. If the only two classes you plan to take in a summer semester are micro and macro then do it, if you believe you have an ounce of work ethic.\n\nMacro is pretty simple, it's just memorizing concepts with some basic math.\n\nMicro is slightly more math heavy.\n\nPre-calc is a pre-req for these entry level economics courses, so I am surprised students cannot find a point of intersection between two lines (for Micro)",

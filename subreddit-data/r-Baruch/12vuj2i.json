    "postText": "Anybody else fed up with the mentally disturbed people all over the city? \n\nCommuting from Queens into the city has caused me so much anxiety. The mentally disturbed have completely infested the subway system. It seems like everyday I encounter some kind of mentally disturbed lunatic having a violent outburst or harassing people. I swear it seems like EVERY DAY I get on the trains it\u2019s like this. \n\nEven near the campus; there\u2019s always sketchy people sitting outside. This is one of the reasons I\u2019m considering picking a more local school that only requires bus to get around. The subways have become completely taken over by psychos, schizophrenics and whatever else \u2026. \n\nToday near Fulton street, I was threatened by a clearly mentally disturbed, young black man on the platform. It was a truly terrifying experience.",

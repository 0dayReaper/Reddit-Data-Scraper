            "comment": "I had Katherine pence last semester as a first semester freshman, it was by far my hardest class not because of the rigor but because of the amount of work we were assigned. Be prepared to read 20+ pages of textbook material, you have to memorize the important names, dates, and other definitions from weekly readings. Professor pence gives you a study sheet for all the important terms for every quiz if I remember correctly. On top of this, you have to review over 30+ pages of presentation slides. With all this information, you\u2019ll have weekly quizzes on the first day of the week, depending on when you have the class. The quizzes are out of 10. Not hard but just completely based off memorization. I believed I may have averaged a 9/10 on the quizzes. She also drops the 2 lowest quiz grades. She gives 2 extra credit assignments also. There are also some other low stakes assignments which she gives. Now for the midterm, for me it was just short responses and an essay question, I got a 100 on the midterm because I studied pretty hard and memorized everything. She also values participation, but just participate like once or twice every class, and you\u2019ll get full participation points. For the final, there were multiple choice questions and an essay, super easy. Got a 90 or something. Finished the class with an A. She\u2019s also a super lenient grader when it comes to the midterms and the finals.",

The midterm for me was 2 short response questions and one essay. The final for me was around 30+ multiple choice questions, and one essay.",

    "postText": "What I find truly outrageous is every class requiring you to pay for connect, cengage, SAM, etc. just to do your goddamn homework. You're paying stratospherically high amounts of money for access codes that last you a single semester, and this goes for pretty much every class you take. You can't buy these access codes used, you can't resell them after you're done, you can't find PDFs online, nothing. You don't even get to have access to the information or to your work after you are done. It is literal extortion, because if you can't afford it, too bad, your grades suffer. And this is all because professors are too lazy to create their own homework or quizzes, so they just force you to pay these exorbitant fees to outsource the content and grading to these monopolistic textbook companies. **Fuck McGraw Hill, fuck Cengage, and most of all, fuck these lazy professors who don't want to do their job and don't care about the financial strain this puts on their students, especially at a time of mass unemployment.**",

            "comment": "Consider, the professors do want to dump this software and textbook. But it is the institution of CUNY itself that is forcing it upon the various colleges in the system. When you have a regulatory board named CUNY which is controlled by the government, it limits the actual autonomous ability of each college, (they have some autonomy) CUNY head office controls most decisions. We have so many adjunct professors in the system and they out number tenured professors. Tenured professors have time and the ability to create a curriculum. The adjunct may just teach sporadically and does not create a curriculum. So CUNY trusts these publishers to supplement material for these adjuncts while still providing an accredited education.\nThe problem goes farther up the chain than \u201clazy\u201d professors (which there are plenty). I\u2019m also going into a small scope of this institutionalized problem that plagues the country\u2019s college education system on a national level, I write this as i brush my teeth so excuse the grammar.",

We are paying $1000 for a class where majority of professors arent even putting in the minimal effort of actually teaching. They assign these software thinking its benefitting us when it's actually hurting us",

I think it benefits administrators and professors to assign this software--they either get kickbacks from the textbook companies themselves, or are effectively bribed by them by being invited on all expenses paid vacation to attend a conference hosted by the textbook companies. They could care less about what benefits the students, they are just looking to line their own pockets.",

CUNY is also at fault.   \nI went to a CUNY community college prior to Baruch though, and not once in 2 years did I have to use any of this BS software. Curious if they don't enforce this in CCs, or if it's really become much more prevalent in the year since I left CC, and especially with online learning.",

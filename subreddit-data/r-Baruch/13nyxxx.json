    "postText": "I have one year left here, don\u2019t get me wrong I love the friends I made here but I don\u2019t feel like I belong here. There\u2019s no community, opportunities are very limiting and our school is underfunded. I also feel like I did not grow as a person at baruch, the commute, living with my family, being in NY my whole life, everything feels so limiting here. I was deciding between UMich Ross and baruch during my senior year of high school. I gave up on Ross because tuition was ~50k for me despite coming from a low income household, and I had medical issues (plus Covid lockdown), but now that I have one year left here, I wonder why I didn\u2019t take the chance. I can\u2019t help but feel jealous of my peers who are at mich right now, wanted to go so bad but I couldn\u2019t make the decision as a teenager with no guidance. I won\u2019t ever have the chance of doing undergrad again at my young age, and I am deeply regretting it. Would you guys have made the same decision as me? Or was I stupid and should\u2019ve taken the debt? Anyone else give up their dream school because of financial reasons? How do I get rid of this feeling, it\u2019s been keeping me up these nights and I don\u2019t want to feel this way.",

I did not wish to incur a tremendous amount of debt so I stayed in NYC and went to parties museums and moved out. Those four years of college are just a fractional four years of an entire life. You have many more that you can do whatever you want with. It sounds like you\u2019re dreading the next stage of life and wish to redo the current one. Take your time going through the dumps and process it. Then focus on your studies and your next goal.",

It's been really hard to socialize and have a fun experience at Baruch as it's harder to do here, but I've been working really hard on it, and it's definitely improved for me.\n\nI try not to compare my experience to those of my friends at other colleges, but if you end up doing that, think of this. Although they may be having more fun, their worries regarding debt, living expenses, and the future can outweigh your regrets. I actually just spoke to my friend who was telling me she just realized that she's supposed to be applying to internships and was crying about having to deal with 250k worth of debt... (she is a senior in an out-of-state uni). She actually regretted going there because now she won't be able to go on her dream vacation and buy a house. So, ironically, her opinion is the opposite of yours now. She wished she went to Hunter.\n\nMy experience at Baruch has made me feel much more secure and confident in myself. I learned to network through clubs, learned to do interviews, create a resume, some financial concepts, and even got an internship. I genuinely believe that if I went to a more expensive college like my friend, I would be clueless right now as I would be too focused on having fun and partying!\n\nNow, I am actively participating in various clubs, which really helped me build friendships, but the key thing was that I needed to keep up the communication to build lasting relationships, which definitely wasn't easy. Still, these friendships helped me get through a lot of the struggles I've experienced and taught me how to build relationships in a  work environment. Truly, these friendships are what improved my experience significantly.\n\nYou can always go get your masters at a dream uni in the future. For now, accept that you can't turn back time and live with your decision. Keep in mind that you won't know what your friends will have to deal with due to their decision in the future. In the future, you may actually be happy that you did what you did. You won't be able to fully get rid of this feeling, but you can just think about the bright side. Don't think about the positive things that you lost; think about the positive things you gained!",

Really wanted to go to NYU but it was just far too expensive. I have similar feelings to yours about Baruch. I remember my first day stepping onto campus how disappointed I was. The vibes were just off. Can\u2019t explain it. There really is no community feel. I feel like students here barely interact or engage with each other let alone the poor professors where it\u2019s like pulling out teeth to get students to participate and interact in class. I definitely wish I would have just went to NYU.",

You\u2019re still young and you can still do everything that anyone else with half a brain and creativity can do! I transferred from after Hunter my 4th year and finished Baruch after 2 additional years starting off in management consulting. That career decision also came only in my final year at Baruch after taking the capstone course (OPM?) and my professor asked me if I would be interested in exploring that field. As you could imagine, it was a pivotal suggestion and conversation that set my future trajectory.\n\nTactically, I whole heartedly recommend going as hard as you can in exploring various career options you think you\u2019d be good at, but may not necessarily excel in. This will help you pinpoint your true strengths and weaknesses, whether it be through personal projects or some form on internships. \n\nIf you got into Ross, then you\u2019re not stupid. Your choices were a matter of circumstance, and I don\u2019t think you made the wrong choice. Please don\u2019t beat yourself up about it, and life is really more than the school you went to at the end of the day. \n\nStrategically, if you still want to later in life, there\u2019s always an option to attend Tier1 uni if you really want to join the old boys club for network access through MBA or EMBA programs; those doors never close if you can find success in your career.\n\nPlenty of my colleagues who didn\u2019t attend Yale, Harvard, or Chicago Booth for undergrad went back after becoming Managers and got sponsored MBAs through their firms. There\u2019s always time to do what you want if you make time for it. :)\n\nGood luck, and fuck the haters. Just don\u2019t ever give up on yourself.",

The only difference is that you would've been 100k more in debt. To me it's not worth it. If you're looking for prestige, just go to a prestigious business, law, or med school. I promise, unless you went to Harvard or some other IVY league, no one cares what undergrad you went to.",

Yes, Baruch lacks in the community and social aspects unless you join clubs (which I do recommend!), but the ROI is worth it in my opinion. You're saving yourself tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars which can be used for your MBA elsewhere or just anything. To me, I wouldn't want to fall into debt. It's risky and I don't want to spend most of my life trying to repay that with my income. I have one year left just like you, and I too still think about the social life I've missed out on. Who would I be friends with right now? Would I have experienced my first football game and school pride? It's totally normal to feel this way and have these thoughts, so don't feel guilty about it! But at the end of the day, you're living for yourself, so might as well take the route with a better value. I'd say just try to make the most of this last year because at this point, it'd be too late to transfer. Best of luck OP! You got this!",

Didnt have friends (at all, they ghosted me.) I just believe the more of a commuter school it is, the harder and the more work you need to put in to make friends. But honestly, thats just what it\u2019s like to be an adult. \n\nGood luck! And dont dwell!

I went to Baruch Fall 2022 and immediately DIPPED and dropped out because I couldn\u2019t handle another semester and I transferred to BMCC and am really happy about it.\n\nI do agree with the others that you shouldn\u2019t keep focusing on the what ifs. I\u2019ve had my fair share of that and the past few months have been stressful because of it. And no matter what know that you saved a bunch of money because no amount of student debt is worth 4 years of a possible slightly better college experience. I got into Temple and for a little moment considered going at the cost of my entire 529, savings, plus loans and said fuck that. No amount of debt is worth it and be proud you haven\u2019t fell in the same trap other students have.\n\nI also wanted to add while I did not enjoy my Baruch experience at all I am grateful I went for that one semester. I didn\u2019t know what the hell I wanted as a student but going through what I did helped me discover more about what I want in a school and how I want to experience college life. You can do the same thing for senior year and life after college. Try and use this as a learning lesson to make sure whatever is in your future you prioritize having a community and more shots at opportunities.",

I wanted to go to Vassar and they gave me pretty good aid (30k per year including housing) but my parents are paying for my college (which I realize is a great privilege to have) and they want to spend as little money as possible. We were bordering on the poverty line for some time until my dad got a better job in recent years. We just can\u2019t afford spending more than 100k on college. And I\u2019m so sad about that. All my friends are going to their dream schools with traditional college experiences. And I come from a slightly diff situation since I went to a boarding high school. So I\u2019ve gotten that little taste of freedom away from my parents. I\u2019ve gotten a taste of what\u2019s it\u2019s like to live in dorms and make friends and go to parties and I really don\u2019t want to leave my high school. I don\u2019t want to go back home to a place where it\u2019s all grind, where I have to commute from home, where I won\u2019t have the same community. \n\nMy plan for the next four years is to just make the best of it. It\u2019s gonna suck not being able to have the same college experience as the rest of my friends (they\u2019re going to places like Columbia, UPenn, Yale, Harvard, Northeastern\u2026 yeah the self esteem issues go crazy I can\u2019t stop comparing myself to them but that\u2019s besides the point), but I\u2019m just going to try my best to be happy. Not worth wallowing in my sorrow and disappointment. And if I really hate Baruch I can try to transfer out I guess? But yeah, those are just my thoughts.",

You are very wrong in the sense that there is no community and opportunities. Just like everything you gotta play with the hand you're dealt. I was low income, first gen, non-diversity.   \n\n\nI joined the right clubs, met the right people, made great friends. I worked my fucking ass off for opportunities, internships, jobs etc. I'm headed into a job that is rare to get even from Umich Ross and I did it from Baruch with 0 debt to my name.  \n\n\nThe advice I want to give is tough, but stop being a whiny fuck. Take pride in the decision you made and face uncertainty head on. You are young, you have a long life ahead, and people would do anything to be in your shoes.  \n\n\nYou live in the United States, are getting a college degree for little to no debt, live with family in comfort. You have no right to FEEL bad about anything. There are people out in the world who can't even fathom what its like to get an education let alone to be in the most expensive city in the world and get one for basically free.  \n\n\nThe mentality you have is what is going to doom our generation. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Go out there and do what needs to be done, no complaining, no bitching, no moaning. Your parents probs sacrificed a lot to get you to where you are today.

Yes, good for you that you got a job but you are a rare % of the bunch at baruch. Like I said, we all have to fight more for the same opportunities and are drained mentally and physically unlike other schools with guaranteed recruitment alongside having other perks like community, etc. and don\u2019t use my family/parents as an excuse I did not mention them once. You don\u2019t know my family situation so using them as an excuse is far fetched.

It was my dream to be in the city, the city that never sleeps, and I love it but my first year experience has made me shift perspectives. I had a terrible roommate, and other events happened to me that significantly lowered my self esteem and worsened my eating disorder. I applied to Binghamton because I also felt there was no community or sense of belonging. I only made one good friend but I\u2019ve been thinking if my first year would have been better at a tradition campus school where you\u2019re secluded with students and I guess are sort of forced to interact (kinda). Anyways I got in, but I\u2019d be paying 17k a year, which to me is a lot. And I don\u2019t want to out that financial burden on myself or my parents. So I won\u2019t be going, but idk I\u2019m telling myself that how good or bad my next 4 years turn out depends on me . I\u2019ll be living with my friend next year, so that\u2019s better, but I\u2019ll still want more of a social life so I\u2019ll be joking clubs and idk trying to immerse myself more into the city life because all I did was isolate myself. But I guess I understand you. I\u2019m choosing to stay, but I\u2019ll never know what could have been if I went to Binghamton. I\u2019ll be stuck wondering whether or not my life would have been better, whether or not I would have been happier, whether or not I would have made a group of friends rather than 1. I\u2019m trying not to dwell on these questions but I hope that when I\u2019m senior I don\u2019t regret choosing to stay. I really really hope I don\u2019t.",

I hope you\u2019ll enjoy your time here more than I did, and make the best of it. also $17k isn\u2019t pocket money for sure but I think you\u2019d be able to pay it off in a lifetime after getting a job, don\u2019t let that be the ending factor.",

A couple of years later with experience, you can move to any part of the country and do anything your heart desires.   Having to make education loan payments force you into decisions that affect you for decades.  Your professional life will shortly start,  so maximize your opportunities and live a lifestyle that you enjoy.   Don't forget that college is about 30 weeks a year and you still have 22 weeks to do what you want debt free if you really value experiences.   \n\nThe only loans worth taking are on appreciating assets and large undergraduate education loans are not worth it considering the slight difference in outcomes ten years into your career.     Students also tend to focus on the initial value of the loan, let's say $200K, but that works out to $300K if paid in 15 years.  A monthly payment of almost $1,700 will also allow you to lease a Porsche 718 Boxster plus insurance if you are debt free.   Investing the $1700 per month in the SP500 for the 15 years could make you a millionaire if the market winds blow your way.  \n\nTake a positive perspective on your situation and you will always feel better about your choices.",

            "comment": "Offering another perspective here aside from the financial aspect, I went to Baruch partly cuz it\u2019s nearer to home due my medical issues. If you went somewhere out of state, dealing with possible medical issues away from home and somehwere unfamiliar might\u2019ve resulted in much worse circumstances. I know several people who had to take a medical leave of been due to medical issues worsening or being unable to handle it alone. \n\nYou still got one year left and while it might not be the typical college experience, I think there\u2019s still you can make a lot out of it. A lot people are gonna move to a major city anyways once they graduate so you get a head start in a lot of ways. But the way you\u2019re feeling is def valid and maybe u can also consider going to graduate school if you really want that typical college experience or even study abroad (there are scholarships that can fund your stay).",

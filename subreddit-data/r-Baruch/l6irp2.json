                    "comment": "Rich investors bet that Gamestop would fail. They 'borrow' stock to sell, which they promise to buy back and return to the lenders within a set time frame - the goal is to sell it while its higher, and buy it back lower ('shorting stocks'). This usually works because other investors see them shorting stocks and assume they know something they don't, and sell as well, thus dropping the price.\n\nNB: they have to pay those stocks back, so if they're wrong, they lose money. The goal is that they're rarely wrong.\n\nr/wallstreetbets notices they are shorting Gamestop stock. They make the call that Gamestop will ultimately survive, even if it takes a hit. They group together to buy the stock to pushback against shorting. The act of them buying the stock elevates its cost, instead of dropping it.\n\nInvestors are bailed out for the loss so far, but continue to short stock for Gamestop to force it down. They end up 'borrowing' more stock than actually exists.\n\nr/wallstreetbets does not stop. They collectively buy up this shorted stock. The value of Gamestop stock is now ludicrously high, many times over its starting value.\n\nInvestors are forced to buy back their stock, but the price is hugely elevated. They need more stock than exists, so demand is hugely elevated, multiplying the stock's value several times over. r/wallstreetbets has created a 'short squeeze', where slow investors are brutally punished.\n\nInvestors lose billions. Many investing companies are now looking at bankruptcy.",

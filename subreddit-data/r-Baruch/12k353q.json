    "postText": "I've been told that acc 3200 is probably the hardest accounting class so I'm not looking for someone easy since that's not possible due to the nature of the class. Rather I want to know who's better at explaining things, how lenient are they with grading, do they go over problems in class to ensure that we understand the concepts, do they give more for than one attempt for the hw, if the exams are online do they allow for you to go back and change answers, is there extra credit, etc. \n\nThey are the only two options for summer so I want to who who's the better choice",

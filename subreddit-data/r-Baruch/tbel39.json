She deserves better, and I hope all of you stop putting up with people who don\u2019t bring you peace. If being with someone gives you anxiety, stress, or brings you out of your character consistently then you need to leave. It\u2019s better to be single and happy! \n\nAnd pay attention when someone gives you half assed energy. Big red flag",

    "postText": "Hi, I don't know if it's okay to ask this here. But anyways.. I'm currently pursuing an integrated masters in data science from a tier 2 college in India. I've completed a 6 months research internship too. I have a cgpa of around 3.3 in US scale. I have two more semesters to go and can bring it to 3.4. I will be doing another 6 months internship too. I want to pursue MFE at Baruch. Can someone let me know my chances. Is this cgpa too low? Thanks in advance!",

That way you will get a few credits and have less to do if you eventually get in to baruch. As far as which credits transfer cuny to cuny is pretty good bur I dk about indian college to US in any way shape or form.",

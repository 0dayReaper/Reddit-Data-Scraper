It seems to me that the majority of people in my classes are already taking it for a second or third time and I really want to be able to pass this first time around . I already tutoring very frequently. Does anyone have youtube channel reccemondations for practice or other resources that helped them when taking the course ? Thank you",

YouTube is helpful (khan, organic chem teacher) and make sure to review your hw problems. But make sure to focus on the final. Practice the practice finals given on the Baruch website. Do all of them and then practice the ones you got wrong + there are video solutions to each individual question. The final is literally exactly those just different numbers and names. I got an A!",

Now I enjoy my summers with no shame :), students thought just studying once or twice a week was enough - well goodluck baruch math department really wants you to fail if you dont take it seriously.",

Mymathlab is great and has a lot of extra practice material, so use it. I had Prof. Espinoza for 2009 and Prof. Jordan for 2205. FYI I'm not good at math at all and barely passed in high school.",

I didn\u2019t really study but my professor was chill and went over the problems thoroughly if people asked. I feel like some of the people who fail either have bad professors or are afraid to ask questions when confused so be sure to ask questions and take advantage of SACC tutoring. Good luck!",

Ended up studying the practice tests that were on the Baruch webpage and thank goodness I did. Prof made the huge mistake of only grading part 1 of the final and not the second, made a bunch of people who were taking STA 2000 next sem be kicked out. YouTube is very helpful and getting me through STA 2000 rn, specifically khan academy has always been clutch.",

They are also easy to follow and vids can go from 5-15 mins which can help if you need a refresher or just want a simplified overview of the topic.\n\nMy professor has [this website](https://stats.proffriedman.net/home) with a bunch of review material for sections in Stats 2000. She herself isn\u2019t the greatest of professors so I\u2019ve been studying the material on my own most of the time and its pretty good in conjunction with the videos. Don\u2019t make the mistake I did and take use of it when you are going into it immediately. Good luck!",

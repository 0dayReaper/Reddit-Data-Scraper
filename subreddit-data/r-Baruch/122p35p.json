    "postText": "Hi guys - I see options for 5 week classes in the summer which would be great for my schedule, however, I am concerned that it's only 5 weeks.\n\nHow intense are these classes? Would you recommend them?\n\nIe. ECO 1002 or OPM 3000\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestion 2: OPM 3000 has 2 options:\n\n3 days per week at 2:54 per day or,\n\n2 days per week at 2:30 per day\n\nObviously, the latter option will have less class time. What is that about?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lgn0wedm3qa1.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e85084ba6be722d9e31b7202e46bb1ca32dd9d49",

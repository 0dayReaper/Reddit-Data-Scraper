Or, take the elevator to 8th and walk down.\n\n- Don\u2019t talk in the library and if you need to then speak low. \n\n- some advisors are terrible, so learn what classes you need to take and ask here just in case. Be on top of this. \n\n- Use rate my professor and Reddit to look up professors because some are truly awful.\n\n- make sure you have your ID and know your emplid # by heart. Also, try to get your ID early because the lines can be crazy. \n\n- use student discounts! UNiDAYS and some places around the school. \n\n- check the syllabus and know your due dates. \n\n- scheduling 3 different classes in one day sounds great because less school time, but it also means having 3 finals all in one day and that may be too stressful \n\n- please participate in the group projects. Don't let your group do all the work. \n\n- say NO to the money scammers that love to hassle the students out front\n\nCongrats on being admitted and don't worry if you make some mistakes. We all learned somehow, so don't stress yourself.",

When you are general admission, it\u2019s so much harder to get information and contact people. \n\nRMP and reddit have really helped me out when picking profs. If you are taking pre cal, get as much tutoring as you can! So many people fail and retake it! This goes for a majority of classes as well especially if you are struggling! \n\nAlso talking to professors and participating really helps, some professors will be easier than others. If you get sick or something happens with work, notify the profs asap so it\u2019ll be on record that you\u2019ve told them. Don\u2019t do this if it\u2019s in a 100+ class though, just do this if you have a big assignment due, like a essay or test, and need an extension/retake. Also don\u2019t be afraid if your GPA gets low after your first year, and don\u2019t let it discourage you from trying harder next sem! :)\n\nPeople say to join clubs early and I completely agree! Don\u2019t be afraid, get some business casual wear, since they used to be in your position too! People say the school is antisocial, which it can be at times. But good people will gravitate towards you as long as you give a good impression. At the end of the day it\u2019s YOUR journey, focus on yourself! \n\nAlways stay on top of class deadlines, I use a app called Power Planner. But I know a lot of people use excel as well, book planners, anything that works for you! Don\u2019t skip classes unless you REALLY need to. It becomes a bad habit REAL quick if done consecutively. Always write down important stuff like class times and the professors email (you don\u2019t know how many times ppl ask for it in group chats when it\u2019s on the syllabus\u2026) Also download WhatsApp if you didn\u2019t already, there\u2019s a option on blackboard to email everyone in the class and people use it mainly to send a WhatsApp group chat link. Can be useful for talking to people if the class incorporates group projects. \n\nGet a reduced fair metrocard!!!!! Great if you are a student, it takes a little bit to get to you, but 1.35 for a ride compared to 2.75 is amazing. Idk what your schedule is like, but if you need food, there\u2019s a bunch of places around campus. Food trucks are good (one even sells water/soda for a dollar), there\u2019s many fast food places (download their apps for better deals), and some local places have 10/15 % student discounts. But if you wanna save, just make something at home, take snacks, bring your own water bottle, but always have something to eat beforehand because (from experience) sitting through a 2 hour lecture having nothing beforehand in the morning sucks.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn as you go, everyone has different experiences and tricks to do things. So just make sure that college is your priority, and get out of the \u201chighschool mindset\u201d asap! Good luck and welcome to Baruch! :&gt;",

Most clubs have Instagram, so you can check if there are any events coming up, @/baruchtimes does some overview  \n2. Stay organized. Read the syllabus, and don't ask stupid questions on group chat (some prof might disallow group chat).   \n3. Be mindful of rate my professor, read the comments, and ask people around you for feedback. Some good prof might get low ratings, and vice versa.   \n4. Start making a study plan as you're going on with the course, don't wait till a week before the midterm or final, as it might be tougher.  \n5. Start looking for an internship. You don't need to get one, you just need to familiarize the application process and practice your interview skill. Idk about your major, but for accounting students, companies like Big 4 have freshman internships (rotational experience programs) that help students discover their interest field. And if you completed them, you have a high chance got a return offer for the next summer and a full-time offer when you graduate. Bro I wish I knew this earlier.  \n6. Know Handshake. You can view upcoming events, apply for jobs, and utilize Starr's benefits including mock interviews and resume reviews on there. And if you want to learn how to write a resume, just google \"Baruch resume\", the same goes with interview practice.  \n7. Google \"Baruch (your major) pathway pdf\", you can get insight on how to make a schedule for next semester. Use Degree Work to check your credits. You can also use Navigate to make an appointment with an academic advisor.   \n8. Some people don't like the new CUNYFirst platform. When making a schedule, you can use this website to check professor and class time: [https://globalsearch.cuny.edu/CFGlobalSearchTool/CFSearchToolController](https://globalsearch.cuny.edu/CFGlobalSearchTool/CFSearchToolController)\n\n9. Library: You can borrow a calculator and use the printer (500 pages per semester or a year I forget) there. And try to not play music, leave trash, or talk loudly in the library. I remember at the beginning of last school year there were like 20 posts complaining about freshman behavior in the library.   \n10. Focus on your mental health, it is okay to take a break. And that's what all I can think of right now, if anything I will update it. Good luck on your journey!",

            "comment": "Start looking for an internship. It helps so much having that experience early, as someone who is about to become a senior without one. Also if you are one of the lucky few to happen to know what you want to do, don\u2019t waste a lot of time and really focus on learning further on what you love. You\u2019ll have that experience that will help you a lot for the future. I think one of my mistakes was giving up on joining a club after I was rejected freshman year. Try as many opportunities as you like because not only will you make best friends but it\u2019ll be something you can really enjoy once you find what you like. Academic wise, try to do assignments as early as possible and understand each professors teaching style, for a lot you\u2019ll have to learn on your own.",

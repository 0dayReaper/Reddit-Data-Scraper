    "postText": "I am currently a student at LaGuardia CC majoring in New Media Technology and will be transferring to a four-year university next semester. I got accepted to both Barcuh( Business Communiaction-Graphic Communication) (BA), City College ( ELECTRONIC DESIGN AND MULTIMEDIA) (BFA), and now I am kinda struggling between those two. tbh I love web design and graphic design so City College also has been my priority. On the other hand, Baurch's (Graphic Communication) major is half business and design which I also can learn about business at the same time plus a higher ranking, So I am thinking that even if I can't find a job in the design field after I graduate I still have a business back up. However, I don't have experience in taking business classes plus I didn't take any business classes at LaGuardia CC therefore now I am kinda struggling to choose when college",

Like you said has more business-y background to it. \n\nI mean location wise idk where it\u2019s easier for you to commute to\u2014If it\u2019s easier for you to get to city college then I\u2019d argue it\u2019s best to go there. Personally for me location was important.",

If youre doing finance/business ect thats more baruchs speed but anything else merged with business may be better suited for another school w more liberal arts, if youre not really dead set on business (to my knowledge)",

You get exhausted going to campus. Aside from the campus the area it\u2019s in is unsafe. \n\nThe buildings are cat fishes. May look nice from the outside but looks like a literal prison inside especially the nac building.\n\nProfessors are also questionable at least on the stem side. \n\nIf you live close to ccny go there but if anything else Baruch is better. Definitely cleaner and far fewer mice lol",

Once you\u2019ve scored an internship and a return offer, you\u2019re pretty much set even if your GPA takes a hit. Which I find funny because a lot of bigger firms \u201crequire\u201d you to have a certain GPA to even apply but won\u2019t really bat an eye if your GPA goes down afterwards.\n\nBut yes, a big 4. Surprisingly there is such a big Baruch presence at KPMG. When I went to Lakehouse (their training facility) on the first night there, they had an orientation and Baruch was the third biggest school, in terms of interns, at Lakehouse which was a shock to me. And when I started working in the office, I met quite a few seniors and managers who went to Baruch.",

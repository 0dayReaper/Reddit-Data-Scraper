    "postText": "I\u2019m currently a lower sophomore and my first semester was rough. The school made my schedule and i had to take chem at an odd time. Long story short i flopped hard and failed. Does this affect me in the long run? I have only had straight A\u2019s since but it\u2019s like a bad scar on my gpa does the fact that it\u2019s from a flexible core make it less damaging? How can i fix it? will i be able to retake a flexible core class like this? PLS HELP",

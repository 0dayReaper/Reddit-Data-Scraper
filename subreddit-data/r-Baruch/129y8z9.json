He also teaches students about soft skills to prepare us for career. If you want to learn and improve your communications dramatically I would take Dargan. He allows us to resubmit our projects too and takes the highest grade. His grading method is VERY fair. Workload is the same across COM 2020 because it is created by the department. You won\u2019t regret taking him.",

Is there any system which notifies you. Otherwise I have to sign in multiple times in a day to see availability of new classes which is kind of annoying.",

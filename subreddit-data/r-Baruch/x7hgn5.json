Out 6.2k admitted freshman only 1.5k enrolled.\n\nAccording to a website (idk how accurate it is since data isn\u2019t on the Baruch website) it said 20-21 acceptance rate was 40.7%. Also stated was the 21-22 acceptance rate at 51%, up from last year by 10.3% and almost a decade ago 12-13 class had a 22% acceptance rate. It\u2019s gone to shit :) still can have a comeback though!",

            "comment": "Had him a year ago, online in the fall. Awesome professor, but a lot of easy work. He is very enthusiastic and loves to teach his subject, and teach in general. His assignments are easy, but I will admit he gives a lot of them. Specifically for the final assignments you really need to listen to him and set up the appointment he recommends to figure out what your final report will look like because otherwise you will be lost. Still, if you\u2019re an accounting major or just have to take acc 2101 then I would recommend this class as preparation because acc 2101 (Harry Davis, the best professor for this class) is basically similar, but with even more work. Overall, would recommend.",

If I withdraw from a class weighing 3 credits it becomes 11.\n\nI'm on the Excelsior Scholarship &amp; I \u00a0enrolled in 9 credits this summer, which means I would still meet the 30-credit per year requirement.\n\nIf not being enrolled full-time makes me lose TAP, will the Excelsior Scholarship cover my remaining expenses? I just want to make sure my parents won't have to pay out of pocket if I drop a class.",

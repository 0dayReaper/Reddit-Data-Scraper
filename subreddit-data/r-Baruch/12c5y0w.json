    "postText": "Hey everyone! As the title suggest I am considering going aboard for spring 2024. Spring 2023 is my second semester at Baruch. I am considering doing the exchange program at Yonsei university in Korea. I am in good academic standing and don\u2019t mind taking challenging classes. I have access to the portal and noticed that many of the classes are really high up (like 3000+). Most of the classes I can take are for my major but I\u2019ve read that it\u2019s best to take elective courses when aboard. So my question is should I hold off going abroad and take all my major classes at Baruch for next spring? If not, what do you recommend I do? \n\nSome classes I would like to take abroad are CTM 1001 (= MGT 3120 from Baruch) and IEE 2060 (=MKT 3000). These are two classes that align with my degree works. I was told by a study abroad advisor that it is recommended to take at most four classes abroad to maintain full time student status. I don\u2019t know what other classes to take. Thank you for the help.",

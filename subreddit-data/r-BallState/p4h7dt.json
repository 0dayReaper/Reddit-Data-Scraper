Is there another way to find a job on campus? Is there people I contact directly? I really need a job as soon as possible. Any help or advice would be very helpful, Thank you!",

It's definitely confusing so I don't blame you lmao. Once you open it and log in, on the far left column has different sections like home, jobs and internships, profile, etc. If you click Jobs and Internships, it'll have a drop down with the section On Campus Student Employment. If you click that it'll show you all on campus jobs! If you're still struggling, I recommend shooting the career center an email at [careercenter@bsu.edu](mailto:careercenter@bsu.edu) :)",

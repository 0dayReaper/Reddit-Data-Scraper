    "postText": "who okayed this re-design? A year ago I heard they were considering actually straightening in out and running it out through the parking lot, why didn't they do that? The gigantic ugly roundabout seem pretty pointless to me without another road. A bus stop would have been better on the other side next to where they're going to be putting the new dorms. ",

There have been multiple articles about that project in the local paper over the last year or so.  BSU is adamant that it not be called a roundabout.  They are keen to point out that it is a \"traffic circle\".  They say roundabouts are designed to move traffic along more quickly, and traffic circles are designed to slow traffic down...  Seems to me that BSU would really like to make campus a \"no car\" zone if they could get away with it.  They've been dropping the speed limits all over campus, and literally just days before move-in this year, they turned the intersection of University and Dicks into a 4-way stop.",

I know two people who have been hit there by cars making quick turns off University.\n\n I don't like the new four way stop at Martin street though. There was already a light. ",

Commuters struggled to find a place to park anyway, and now they're out a couple hundred spots. I was lucky enough to be able to get a pass for CR7 (top floor of the garage behind Sursa) but not everyone can afford a reserved pass.",

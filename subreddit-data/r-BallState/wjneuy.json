    "postText": "I'm an incoming first year at BSU with junior status from dual credits in high school, so I have most of the core curriculum done and just need to finish required courses for psych majors. I already have taken AP Psych and dual credit Quantitative Reasoning in high school so those courses I don't need to retake, but I'd like to know if there are any psych classes that psych majors could recommend for these next few semesters. Additionally, any teachers you guys liked and didn't like would be very helpful to know.",

If you meet all the requirements for Ivy Tech at MCHS you can get your associates and that's what I did, you just essentially have to stay VERY focused on earning it. I definitely was a bit worried for a bit because I took like 9 or so AP courses and it was either hit or miss with credit from those, but I luckily got passing scores on every exam. But I definitely am one in a few that actually had enough to transfer as a junior, many only get sophomore status.",

Many of the classes I took that were dual credit were of course what met Ivy Tech's requirements so I could get my degree, but when they transferred over to BSU with my AP scores it showed that all that was left was 4 credits in the core curriculum and then major required credits. So I have the credits of a junior and won't have to retake those classes.",

    "postText": "Hello! Me and two friends were planning on renting a house for the Fall 2021-Spring 2022 school year, when one of my friends had to opt out- we are now down a roommate. If anyone needs a place to stay next year, please hit me up! I'm a gal and my friend's a dude, so gender is not an issue or anything like that. Rent would be around $350-375 before utilities. Hit me up asap.",

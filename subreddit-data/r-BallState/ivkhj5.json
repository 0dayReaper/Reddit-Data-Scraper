    "postText": "Sooo I\u2019m a freshman at Ball State. Due to Covid-19 I\u2019m not having the experience I expected to have (Maybe I can blame my habit to have high expectations) but I\u2019m not having a good time. I have 3 in person classes and 3 online classes, so I\u2019m getting the best of both worlds. I\u2019m seriously debating on IUPUI next semester.  Going to IUPUI, I can live at home (which is fine with me), I have a job lined up if I want to work, and it would save me money since I won\u2019t be living on-campus. Also IUPUI has both of the majors that I want. Ball State only has one of the majors. But I have friends at Ball State that I don\u2019t want to leave. I have gone home every weekend since school started because I feel like I need a break and my mental health is taking a toll. Should I stick it out for a full year or transfer at the semester!?\n\nI need advise please!!",

Theres no sense in spending the exorbitant amount of money for an education that to you could have been more complete. Making friends in college is an important part of the experience too, but unless that was a bigger part of your goal in going to college than learning about fields you may want to work in the future I would give it less weight in your decision.",

            "comment": "Everyone is different. For me personally this has been my most productive semester by far, because I'm not dealing with the extra bullshit and teachers struggling to fill class time with busy work. Online courses really helps imo, I only have one in person.\n\nThat being said as an undergrad I'd be pretty disappointed. But to be fair I've heard that iupui doesn't have the same campus feel as bsu or purdue etc. So be careful you won't regret leaving, also be sure your credits transfer, they're pretty expensive.\n\nEdit One trend I saw a lot before covid was people who go home every weekend get a lot less out of the college experience. If you aren't around to build some of those bonds outside of class the social side of things tends to struggle. I'm not sure it sounds like that's a big issue for you though. And while it might feel limiting there really are still a lot of things to do in Muncie, you just have to look harder for them compared to a city like indy.",

I normally am a bit annoyed being a commuter since most things were tailored for on campus students (understandably pre Covid) but I am pretty glad I\u2019m not paying for a dorm now. \n\nIf it was feasible for me to do, I would be switching to a school taking Covid seriously by being all online. I don\u2019t see BSU getting its shit together anytime soon. A family friend teaches here and when I asked they said that this semester was BSU barely holding itself together, so I really doubt they are magically going to be better funded and prepared next semester.",

I'm a semester away from graduating and my three years at IUPUI haven't been the college experience you would think.  BSU has a more college feel and if that's what you're after then I recommend staying. You can get a college experience at IUPUI if you end up getting into one of the dorms but if you live off campus then it can get rather dull. IUPUI's academics though are top notch and being in downtown indianapolis provided me plenty of opportunities to start building a resume for after I graduate. Basically, if you want a college experience stay but if you'd rather put your education first you can't go wrong with IUPUI.",

            "comment": "One word of caution - make sure the classes you're already taking can be transferrable credits for IUPUI's curriculum. Gen classes are usually safe but I believe some classes for majors may not be.\n\nWhat major/s are you interested in? Why those majors specifically? Not sure if you're fresh out of high school type freshman but I'd try and stick around for more than a semester. One thing that people do early on at BSU is try and front-load all the core requirement classes, which gimps their interest in school and makes them do worse. I spread those out over my 8 semesters there and didn't burn out from that. \n\nHave you tried talking to your friends about maybe doing a zoom call or hangout on weekends if y'all don't feel comfortable hanging out in person? I think that might help you feel better. \n\nYou could also check out the counseling center for resources or talk therapy, though I'd imagine there'll be a fair wait for the latter.\n\nKeep in mind that you're going through a pretty major change on top of the pandemic so being stressed out is understandable. I think before making any decisions you should think about if doing IUPUI would really help, even if it sounds appealing right at this moment. It may alleviate some issues you're having but it could also make you more stressed for any number of reasons.\n\nE: there's a big wooded area near campus, out past the science complex. There's also a greenhouse on campus over in that same general area. If you're wanting to get out of your room without coming into contact with a lot of people.",

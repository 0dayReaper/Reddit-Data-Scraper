Most of the people we've met far seem to be mainly focused on getting *\"Lit\"* every weekend, and not that we don't appreciate a good time, but spending every Saturday night hunting down ragers isn't really working for us. If your looking for friends who have an appreciation for art, music, and Nintendo 64s, hit us up.\n\n\\- Andrea and Tori",

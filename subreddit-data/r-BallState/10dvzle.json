    "postText": "Me and my current roommate are rooming in a double room in Botsford/Swinford. We\u2019ve been looking for apartments but have decided that\u2019s out of the question, we\u2019ve seen recently that a selection of dorm buildings offer a suite option. I haven\u2019t been able to find anything online about a layout or floor plan. Does anyone have any knowledge about the different types of suites or how they\u2019re set up? Kitchen, laundry, common area, or room situation? Is it like a small apartment within the dorm? I\u2019m starting the 2023-24 semester as a junior so I feel like I\u2019d have a decent chance of getting one of these but i\u2019m not going to apply for something I have no knowledge of. Please help!",

            "comment": "As someone currently in a suite with a single room and one suite mate , these were difficult to get as a future senior, specifically if you are a girl as there are more girls at ball state in general and those who choose to continue in the  dorms and they allot the same amount of suites for guys and girls. It will be much easier to get suites that are larger (4 person suites). All of the suites are in kinghorn. Park only has doubles, singles, and 4 studio dorms that are meant for one person. Please feel free to DM if you have any more questions!",

And there are 325 or so COVID patients in the hospital in Indiana right now. I\u2019ve been tracking this and it hasn\u2019t jumped up, it has been a slow rise. All the scary headlines on this are either out of context or downright misleading. I saw one that said \u201chospitalizations double in local hospital in past two weeks.\u201d They went from 5\u201310 COVID cases in the hospital. That\u2019s not some huge number but of course the headline was designed to create fear. Omnicron pt 2 is no more lethal than the original, thus far. We have to learn to live with this virus bc it isn\u2019t going away.",

For that to happen I think hospitals would have to be really overrun and I don't think we will see that to the extent that it was happening earlier in the pandemic.",

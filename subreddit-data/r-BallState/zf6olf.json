    "postText": "I'm planning to attend Ball State after graduating high school next year. I have a 2.8 cumulative GPA with 1060 on my SAT score. One F on my high school transcript unfortunately (it was for computer science), but most of my other grades are pretty much A's and B's, some C's sprinkled here and one D. Would I have any chance at making it into BSU? I've been thinking about it a lot, I definitely could've done better in high school but oh well.",

    "postText": "I applied for a graduate program and my application is under review. I was just wondering how long I can expect it to be in the under review section. Days, weeks, months? If anyone has a ball park estimate I'd appreciate it. I get antsy and don't want to be obsessively checking if it won't be updated for months. I applied for the spring 2023 semester if that makes a difference.",

He sat in the back to borrow a laptop charger if I remember correctly.\n\nOne student left, and Dr. Borna singled him out to move to the front, even though there were supposedly other students also on their laptops not in the front. \n\nWhen the student refused, Dr. Borna called UPD. Which no matter how you look at this whole thing, was the wrong move. The student wasn't being aggressive and felt like he was being singled out because of his race.\n\nUPD wasn't hostile but they weren't exactly nice. They seemed to take the professor's side. Ultimately, the student just left the class because there is video and his classmates were on his side. It's just a bad situation all around.",

From what I've heard after the fact, UPD hates the situation just as much as the students because they were used for a petty reason.",

Mufasa minded his own business after his seat was taken and was not disrupting the class at all. The only person who disrupted the class was Borna himself. From what I know lots of kids sit in the back of the room with their laptops and don\u2019t get cops called on them. I\u2019m still ashamed in BSU for allowing such incredible misuse of power and letting Borna off the hook with no punishment for endangering the class",

There was no danger to the class y\u2019all are blowing this out of proportion. UPD is ALSO there to provide BUILDING SECURITY. Which is what that call was about.

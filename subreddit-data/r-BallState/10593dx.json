    "postText": "Is anyone else having the issue of their TVs or gaming devices not connecting to BSUguest? I have everything registered through mydevices.bsu.Edu, but when I go to connect on my switch it says \u201cRegistration is required to connect to this network\u201d and attempts to take me to the BSU guest page where you click \u201caccept\u201d- but it does not load. Normally, in the past, it would just connect straight to the wifi on my switch without having to do any logins on the switch itself. Let me know if anyone else is having this issue. Thanks.",

Unfortunately a vendor is also having issues with their site, which is preventing us from fixing the MyDevices portal. \n\nOne work around you can try is connecting your laptop to \"bsuconnect\" and then going to the MyDevices portal. Then enter the MAC address of your bsuguest device that is having the issue.",

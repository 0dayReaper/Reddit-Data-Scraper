He was competing with \"The Region\" in The Tournament midwest region and he's still as good as ever, putting up 27 points in the one game he got to play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe caught up with Jerrod on life after college, let us know what you think:\n\n[https://nothingbutnylon.com/jarrod-jones-success](https://nothingbutnylon.com/jarrod-jones-success)",

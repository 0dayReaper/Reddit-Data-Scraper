    "postText": "Hi everyone,\nI'm wondering if anyone has any experience or knows anyone who was able to get prescribed medicine from the health center for anxiety. I have been struggling for a while and should have called earlier but I'm not sure if it will work out. Just wanted to know if anyone had experience with the health center and how it went. \nThanks in advance",

            "comment": "So I recently went to the health center for the exact same reason.\n\nThe psychiatrist was helpful and prescribed me medicine. She asked me a ton of questions, which I answered truthfully, to determine if I needed an antidepressant. It was incredibly thorough, and naturally they want to make sure you and those around you are safe. I spent roughly an hour there and got a script to take to my pharmacy of choice. \n\nGenerally, it was a good experience. However, my wait time to get into the health center for this specific reason was roughly a month. \n\nIf you have more questions, I'd be happy to answer them to the best of my ability. Hope this helps.",

They are very understanding and have lots of treatment options. I also think that they understand college specific stressors more than other doctors would.\n\nAlso, if calling to make an appointment is too much, you can always walk in and make it in person. That\u2019s what I ended up doing.",

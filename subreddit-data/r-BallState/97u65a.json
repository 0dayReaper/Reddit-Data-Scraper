If you get caught with a parking pass that doesn't match up with your car, you'll be fined, towed, etc. Just get a permit at the stadium. You can still park on campus during the weekends if you need to. ",

Get stadium for now and park there during the week but during the weekend, you can park anywhere on campus. That's what I'm doing for now. I got on the wait list really early and called yesterday and as of then, I'm about a 2 weeks wait from getting a closer spot to my dorm. They go through 10 people on the waitlists per week.",

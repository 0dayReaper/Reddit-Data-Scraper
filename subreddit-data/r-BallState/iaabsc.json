I hate being stuck at home and my job is 100% reliant on campus being open BUT I also don\u2019t want to be a walking Petri dish bringing COVID home to my family every day. Plus you already have dumbasses planning parties. For once I\u2019m not looking forward to the start of the semester.",

The worst part is because Mearns wanted money, he\u2019s going to shut down dorms after a bit and everyone will go right home during the asymptomatic stage most likely and infect their families. This is just going to be so ugly and sad, I\u2019m ashamed of our administration and their fake show or new banners and \u201ccardinal care\u201d, if they did they would\u2019ve made the most out of online and kept it that way till the vaccine comes.",

That's after they already bought out dozens of professors already.\n\nHell, southern schools (Alabama, Georgia, etc) plans to have fans in the stadium for their football game! What an utter joke. \n\nSchools shouldn't be in a position to falter when people are online.",

All the kids in the dorm won\u2019t have any idea they\u2019re sick and have no where to go but back home to infect their whole community unwittingly. It\u2019s frankly disgusting to see all the posturing about caring about our health while knowingly risking lives, I agree.",

    "postText": "Since when are the meters in front of Woodworth enforced 24 hours? I thought all parking was free after 7pm. I just got a $20 ticket after parking outside for 10 minutes. This is such fucking bullshit. If that\u2019s the case, there needs to be fucking signs. This is my third ticket THIS SEMESTER and all of them have been for stupid bullshit. Fuck Parking Services, fuck the meters that last for 45 minutes when classes are 50 minutes, fuck all of it. It\u2019s fucking stupid bullshit and I\u2019m sick of it. ",

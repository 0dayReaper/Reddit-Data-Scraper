    "postText": "   Housing sent out an email regarding dorms for this semester.\n   Double Dorms: The university will allow students to room together if they wish. They will help you locate a room. In addition they will give you instructions on how to keep the room clean.\n   Single Room: If you want a single room you can request one. If you thought you wanted to share a room but changed your mind you can request a single room. However there is a limit on single rooms so it will be first come first served.\nAn email will be sent out Thursday so students can chose if they dorm w/ others or want a single room to themselves.",

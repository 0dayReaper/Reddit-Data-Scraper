    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman at Ball State and I\u2019m trying to fill out a housing application. The prices for things like meal plans and the room itself differ depending on the hall you\u2019re in. Are you assigned a hall and is it based on your major? And if you\u2019re assigned one, at what point do you know what one you\u2019re in? The deadline for the meal plan stuff is July 15th and you can sign up for an orientation after that date so it can\u2019t be something you figure out orientation day. \n\nIn short: how does this shit work I don\u2019t understand, Ball States website is not helpful at all it\u2019s incredibly vague",

I always recommend the 14, unless you plan on going home a lot on the weekends (which you shouldn\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019ll rob you from your college experience) in which you should get the 10.",

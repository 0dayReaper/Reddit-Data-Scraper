Food and lodging isn't really a perk here considering your options are to provide it to your counselors, demand that they pay for it, or they have to commute and as we discussed, 5 dollars an hour is not worth either of those expenses. \n\n\n\n\nAn argument could also be made that your wage of ~5 dollars an hour is illegal under both Indiana and federal law considering minimum wage for both is 7.25. The average babysitter in Indiana makes 12 dollars an hour watching between 1 and 2 kids and getting to go home after work. \n\n\n\n\nIt certainly sounds to me like you need to reevaluate your budget so you can provide your counselors with a living wage. Especially considering your operation crumbles without them...",

Full time, weekends off, 4th or July off.\n\n\nNet pay $2500 or approximately $10.41 an hour. \n\n\nFood and lodging provided at no cost. \n\n\n\n\n[Insert information about how fun the job will be, location, etc, here] \n\n\n\n\nIn this country, in this economy, and in this housing market, it's important to be crystal clear about compensation, expectations, and benefits if you want anyone to take the job. We are past the time of doing things \"for the community\" and on average you'll find people want decent pay more than a fun job. It sounds like, for Indiana, this is a well paying gig. Advertise it better so that people can see that and take the job. \n\n\n\nGood luck.\n\n\n-A random dude from Oregon.",

Plus, the 25\u00a2 wings are only for 21+.\n\nIf you're of legal age and looking for more quality for a little more money, Johnny Carino's has 50\u00a2 wings on Thursdays. They're bone-in or boneless, pretty solid wings. And I gotta give a shout-out to Savage's Ale House. You'll spend like $10 but you get one of the best meals in town for the price. Not to mention $1.50 PBR all day everyday!",

Is there any way I could petition, without being enrolled, for the campus to utilize more Coke products? Only then could I comfortably transfer to Ball State. Anyone know?",

We have a contract with Pepsi, so that\u2019s who supplies the majority of the vending machines on campus, the beverages at athletic events, and the fountain machines at the dining halls. You can, as another commenter mentioned, buy bottled Coke products in the dining halls, but that\u2019s about it. \n\nYou could certainly petition, but since it\u2019s tied to athletics concession stands, there\u2019s a very tiny (basically no) chance there would be any action taken.",

This, sadly, meant no Mtn. Dew, which is, sadly, a need for me. That's why I went to Waterloo, they have Pepsi products over there!",

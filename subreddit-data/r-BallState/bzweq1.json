    "postText": "Hey I'm an upcoming freshman and I was wondering what are the best places to cry at a moderate noise level between classes. Preferably a quiet area but not too quiet so I don't get murdered. Smh the only one who gets to kill me is me. I also like to hear people in the distance as it makes me feel slightly less empty inside but still quiet enough so that to where I don't feel the need to push people away who just wanna help me bc no one is gonna do it anyway. Cool thanks! :) \u2764\ufe0f",

There was a semi-private communal space almost no-one knew about. \n\nAlternatively there is the library. Plenty of places in the back of the stacks, some even have chairs. Make great places to take a nap too.  You could check out one of the study rooms online too. You could have some privacy in there, you'd probably be heard some, but it'd be semi-private. Beyond that just cry as you're walking. Not a lot of private areas until after classes are largely done for the day.",

            "comment": "Most buildings have one or two good places if you know where to go. Try walking around to where your classes will be and check the maps to look for weird stairwells or secluded hallways that don't go much of anywhere. Upper floors are sometimes emptier due to more office rooms but you might accidentally walk in on some office-only access area so be careful. \n\nSome buildings will have limited basement access with a little alcove next to the doors that only service staff can open. Many of them are seldom used so those are convenient. I'd probably have good suggestions for a few buildings. \n\nMore importantly, check out the counseling services or talk to someone you trust please :\\^]",

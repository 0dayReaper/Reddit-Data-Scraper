    "postText": "I was required to do primary research for my English 104 class and I have created a survey to collect data for my primary research. The survey\u2019s 40 questions long, but it takes less than ten minuets to take. If I could get some people to take the survey it would really help me out and I would really appreciate it! \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mmMJSxcHAjbjGaX-3vmRhDUN0LR5nugM7y5Ycr_Hey0/viewform?edit_requested=true&amp;fbzx=5312731011198806308#responses",

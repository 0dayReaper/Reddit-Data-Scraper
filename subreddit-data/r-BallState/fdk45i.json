It was always full of kids in drugrugs and skinny jeans, chain smoking and dropping tabs all day in that cage.\n\nBefore they put it there, everyone smoked in the driveway next to it or behind lafollette and johnson on Euclid Ave.",

Honestly, the crowd that was there when I was a senior was lot more toxic than the crowd that was around druing my freshman year. Before, kids would just smoke cigs right off campus over the fence and walk down to the creek to smoke weed, or sometimes go into the woods by the duck pond to drink. Then this newer crowd came in 2015 after the smoking area was built and almost everyone in it was dropping acid every week, staying in \"the box\" all day, and generally being cunts personality wise",

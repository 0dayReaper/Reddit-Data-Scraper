As it stands, I don\u2019t think it is impossible for you to get accepted but I don\u2019t  think it is likely either. If you don\u2019t get in , enroll at Ivy Tech, get some core classes under your belt, get A\u2019s and B\u2019s, and you\u2019ll get into BSU.",

They're now looking at how your grades have evolved over 4 years of high school. They're also looking at extra curricular activities and community engagement I believe. \n\nIf your grades have remained stagnant since Freshman year then really focus on getting As and Bs this last year. If you're not already volunteering in your community then I would recommend getting involved. It looks good on college applications and it's just a good thing to do in general. The Good Samaritan Network is the largest non profit Network in Hamilton county. They would be a good place to start per volunteer work.",

Have your grades gotten better during high school? \n\nI'd say it's possible but I wouldn't bank on you definitely getting in. If you don't I know people who have gone to Ivy Tech and taken a year of classes there before enrolling as a transfer to BSU. \n\nGood luck! ",

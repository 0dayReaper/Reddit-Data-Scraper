    "postText": "Hello! I'm a student at Ball State and I'm hoping I can meet new people through here and maybe develop some bonds. Currently, I'm a computer science major. I enjoy walking, games, and sci-fi movies! El Camino just came out so I'm re-watching all of Breaking Bad, can't wait till I see get to the movie! Got questions? Great! Ask me! :) I'm happy hanging out or talking on social media, I use Snapchat and Discord a lot if you have either of those.\n\nThanks for reading! Hope to hear from you.",

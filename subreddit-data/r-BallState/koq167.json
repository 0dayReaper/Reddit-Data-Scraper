On-campus also work well if you have a weird schedule or need to change hours for class or really anything related to the university. On-campus pay is standardized I believe. Off-campus can usually get more hours. Off-campus pay is all over the place. Some good gigs, but a lot of dirty or food service/delivery jobs. Off-campus is more likely to have weird/out side of normal hours.",

However you aren\u2019t guaranteed hours and sometimes there just aren\u2019t any orders available. I use it to supplement the money I make from teaching lessons and I get by better than many others I know.",

There\u2019s not much within biking distance of campus or the surrounding areas, unless you\u2019re just doing deliveries from restaurants in the Village. You can try doing it on bike, but I imagine you\u2019ll make more money if you just do it by car.",

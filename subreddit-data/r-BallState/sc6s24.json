And there was also an incredibly brief stint where there was an Angry Monday Guy. \n\nAlso, Late Nite and UPB have their own mascots, Hootie and Buzz respectively. \n\nThere\u2019s actually some more I could add since I was a super senior a couple of years ago, and knew campus a bit more intimately than most, but I won\u2019t bore you with the details.\n\nReally enjoy the iceberg!!!

Someone was arrested (a teenager) for shooting three Detroit men to death.\n\nPresident Mearns was part of the prosecution team that convicted Timothy McVeigh (the man who bombed a federal building that killed hundreds of people). Not a lot of the younger students know this about President Mearns.\n\nThere is no climbing wall incident. There is a giant rock climbing wall at Ball State and there have been no reported injuries/incidents but I wanted to make the iceberg a little goofier.\n\nElection 2020 incident is described in another comment.\n\nThe Scramble Light is usually the most populated area on campus, so if you are there at 3 in the morning it is creepy to see how desolate and quiet the area is. Especially with the robotic voice saying \"wait\" and no one is there.\n\nThere have been bodies found in different parts of the White River (a long river which flows pretty close to campus).\n\nWorkers can get on top of Pruis to wash or do maintenance on the building which is very cool to see.\n\nThere is no 11th floor of Teacher's College, that would just be the roof. I made this up too, but the teacher's college is the tallest building on campus so the 11th floor would be the highest point on campus.",

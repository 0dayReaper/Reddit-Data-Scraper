New students can\u2019t just go in and register without meeting an academic advisor first. \n\nClasses start on Monday and offices are closed until then. Incoming students have been able to register for appointments since May 1. It may be extremely difficult for you to get the classes you want since you\u2019ve waited until the last moment.",

Do you think there's a possibility to register this week, how do I go about this? Do international students meet with the international advisor or their department advisor?",

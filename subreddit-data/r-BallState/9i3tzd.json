    "postText": "So in my first year of high school I did pretty shit. I had a weighted GPA of 3.2. Unweighted was probably pretty low. But in the summer of my junior year GED, last year, and I now just go to community college. Since then i have only gotten As in my classes and have a 4.0 with 17 credit hours. I'm worried they are going to look at my shitty sophomore year grades and bamboozle me. I'm sorry if this is a weird request and completely out of what is typically post here. I just put my transfer app. In and I'm just feeling pretty anxious about it.",

I think I graduated from high school with a 3.2ish thanks to a good senior year after a few not as great years. I did a year of community college with about a 3.0 GPA and was accepted. Your 4.0 in community college will certainly help. And you obviously care, so as long as your admission paperwork shows that, I think you'll be good.",

Had a GPA of 3.5 when I applied and got in. I graduated high school online and never took the SATs or ACTs. If you have a considerable amount of college experience already and are getting decent grades they don't really care too much about how you did in high school.",

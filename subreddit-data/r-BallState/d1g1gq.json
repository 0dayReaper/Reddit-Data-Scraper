Sit in the student section near the band if you're looking for energy. I was a BSU cheerleader and always preferred when I got to cheer band-side. After I stopped cheering, my favorite games were when I found myself sitting near family members of the football players. It warmed my heart to see them get all excited.",

Then we were usually at the Schue four hours before kickoff to rehearse for a bit, eat, and get ready for pregame. My only real scheduling complaint when I did it was how the games fell. In 2015 we had one game at the beginning of September, then no game until Homecoming the first week of October, then games on 4/5 Saturdays in October, and not another one until the night before Thanksgiving Break. Having that many Saturday games in a row sucked as a freshman who really missed home, but a lot of times my section would hang out after the game which helped.",

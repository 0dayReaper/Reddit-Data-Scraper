They are located at First Presbyterian Church at 1400 W Riverside Ave, on the corner of Riverside and New York Ave (see the welcome sign). They are fully and actively supportive of LGBT rights (I think they still have a pride flag on their sign). \n\nThey have a lot of small group events which they advertise via their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GraceVillage). You can learn more about them and email their amazing pastor [here](http://gracevillagebsu.com/) if you have questions. You could also attend First Presbyterian or Lutheran Church of the Cross to learn more.",

They had their own building back then but it was demolished for the new health professionals building. The pastor in charge is Rob and he\u2019s wonderful. At least when I went it was mostly people who wanted to attend specifically LGBT friendly church stuff.",

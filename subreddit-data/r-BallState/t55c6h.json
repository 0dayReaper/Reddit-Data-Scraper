I dunno, that\u2019s just me.",

It was the fact that if an infected person sneezes with or without a mask, aerosolized covid would be drifting 30 ft away for nearly 30 seconds.  A mask reduced it to 20 ft but the infection rate did not change in a controlled study because people who come within 30 ft of eachother generally also walk within 20ft of someone who walked within 20ft of them. \n\nThe fact that it is aerosolized should logically lead to the rest, but of course they made sure that covid was like the other thousands of similar viruses.",

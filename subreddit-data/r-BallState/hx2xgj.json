The landlord is super sweet and easy to work with, maintenance gets to you either the day of or day after you put a request in, and there\u2019s a Blue bus stop 100ft from the building, like someone else said. It\u2019s about a 15 minute walk to the Scramble Light as well if you like walking :) I believe a one bedroom is $500/month? And then I\u2019m not quite sure what a two bedroom is. Their website has all that info on it though!",

Pet friendly, salt water pool, shuttle to campus, gym, coffee bar, beach volley ball... this place is really great. \n\nWe pay about $460 ea for a 3 bedroom. Which I think is slightly above average in the area, but honestly worth it because it feels less trashy than normal college pads",

            "comment": "Food:  If proximity to the stadium is important, Geno's (Italian restaurant) is the closest place to the stadium.  It enjoyed an extensive remodel and grand opening last year, but their beer selection is better than their food, IMO.  A couple hundred yards down from Geno's on Bethel is Damask Cafe, a Middle-Eastern restaurant, which is quite good.  If proximity to the stadium is not imperative, I would recommend checking out Elm Street Brewing Company.  Very popular place in a well-worn neighborhood near downtown - with great on-site brewed beer, guest taps, and really good food.  \n\nParking:  The tailgating area is a large grass field across the street from the stadium.  Get there early, if you can, to avoid the rush.  Traffic on Tillotson and Bethel can be pretty bad as that lot fills up.\n\nHotels:  The closest hotel to the stadium is a Best Western on Bethel that's literally a couple hundred yards from the stadium.  Not very nice, and not much to do around there after the game, but if proximity is important, you can't get closer.  If you stay there, both your parking and lodging issues are solved, as you can walk to the stadium from the hotel in less than 5 minutes.  The newest and nicest hotel in town is the Marriott in downtown Muncie.  If proximity to the stadium is not important, and if you want things to do after the game, that's where you should stay.  The hotel has a Three Wise Men chain on the ground floor, and you're also within about six blocks walking distance from a half dozen other locally-owned bars/restaurants.  If you stay downtown, if you have time, and if you enjoy craft beer, check out 'Heorot' on Walnut.  It's a Muncie institution and has been nationally-recognized by multiple publications for its seemingly limitless selection of beers.",

Damask is really good for middle eastern food. Concannon's has fantastic donuts. Downtown farmstand has delicious veggie sandwiches (spinach melt w/ garlic aioli is amazing). Sunshine caf\u00e9 will fill you the heck up with breakfast food (or a great BLT) the day after the game.\nI say you also have to try MTs BBQ because it opened after I left Muncie and I want to know what I've been missing!\n\nOh, and if you are going north on your way out of the city, stop by Ivanhoe's! Great burgers and shakes. ",

There's also the Downtown Farmstand if you want something Organic. ",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI recently got a call informing me that I have an upcoming interview for the Whitinger scholarship. I know that this consists of an Interview and an impromptu essay, and that this will probably decide whether I get a full ride or not. If anyone out there, current students or alumni, has any tips or advice to prepare for it, or knows anyone who has been a Whitinger scholar, It\u2019d  be really appreciated. It\u2019s really a great opportunity for me and my family and I\u2019d appreciate any help that could help me get one of these scholarships. Thanks!",

The last thing they want to see is some overextended, perfected form of who you are.\n\nDo your best, and best of luck!!",

There is no right or wrong answer per se, and it\u2019s more of a test to see you as a person and not just a name on a list. Despite it seeming very intimidating at the outset, my interviewer was very kind and friendly throughout, so my best advice is to be yourself! Good luck with the application process!",

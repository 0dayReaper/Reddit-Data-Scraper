            "comment": "They have university-affiliated apartment complexes which are spaced away from campus. Those are Anthony and Scheidler. Typically older students, grad students, and families live there. You can find the rates on BSU\u2019s website. A lot of people opt to live there because you don\u2019t have to search for a roommate (may be assigned one) or you can live on your own, and it takes away the problem of apartment-hunting.\n\nIf you want cheaper housing, look off-campus. There are some cheaper apartment complexes which will require you to take the bus or drive to campus. There are also some within walking distance. Don\u2019t live in Village Promenade if you can help it, it\u2019s very expensive and poorly constructed.\n\nIf you want a roommate or a cheap living situation, look on Facebook housing pages for Muncie. There are a few with local landlords who don\u2019t have their own websites, or people looking for subleasers or roommates. You can also post what you\u2019re looking for and people will comment. These are the names of a few Facebook pages: Muncie Homes For Rent, Muncie Rental Homes, Ball State University Housing, Sublets, and Roommates",

Prices were rising when I left so I\u2019m not sure what typical rent might look like now. I\u2019d really recommend looking to take someone\u2019s spot as a subleaser if you\u2019re only staying a year, you might be able to find a good deal with someone already doing the legwork of finding a place.",

    "postText": "Hey, so I don't actually go to Ball State, but I was invited by my girlfriend to go to her homecoming. Just thought I'd ask some questions here.\n\nWhen I talked to her she said that on family weekend her mom was able to find free parking and I can park for free too.\n\nHowever, when I looked online I didn't see anything about free parking. I see the visitors pass for $5, but that's about it. So I'm not sure if the free parking was only for family weekend or something.\n\nI just wanted to confirm with you guys if there's free parking or not. I'm not opposed to buying the parking pass, in fact it's much cheaper than what my university is charging.",

Expect to have a really hard time finding a spot, though, since all of the folks with stadium parking passes are required to move their vehicles on campus to clear the stadium lot for the game.",

            "comment": "Check enforcement hours for the lots. Almost all of the parking lots on campus are not monitored on the weekends. You can park in just about any red, green, or blue lot (probably more, idk) as long as it\u2019s after 5 or 7 pm on Friday. Enforcement hours are posted on the signs in each parking lot and you can find them on the parking map online. Just make sure you don\u2019t park anywhere that\u2019s metered or has a \u201c24 hour tow\u201d marking, because these are still enforced on the weekends. If you need to park somewhere before 5 on Friday, I\u2019m pretty sure both parking garages have $1/hour parking. You could also try parking at the church behind Dehority and Park Hall, then moving your car once the on-campus lots are safe. I did this pretty often when I was in Park and never had any issues. Hope this helps!",

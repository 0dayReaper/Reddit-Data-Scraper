You may be able to find a slightly nicer place if you have asthma or something that requires controlled air (AC). Lafollete or Johnson will most likely be the options you\u2019ll be considered for, Noyer if things fill up fast or you get lucky.",

I was in Woodworth, which is still an all-women dorm unless things have changed in the last couple years, and aside from it getting really hot on the upper floors it was really nice being able to go downstairs and get some of the best food on-campus without needing to go for a trek. Park hall is also really nice. I did my first semester in Johnson, before it was remodeled, so IDK if the rooms are still Z-shaped. Your choices i think depend on both seniority and room availability. Most of my friends got put in LaFollette their first year, since it's the biggest one on campus.",

Sometimes there are facebook groups of incoming freshman looking to dorm with people in similar tracks as well.\n\nI have no idea if they are continuing construction work on the new dorms/tearing down lafollette during the quarantine and if they will be done by the beginning of the year, but it's possible that you might be put in one of those as well.",

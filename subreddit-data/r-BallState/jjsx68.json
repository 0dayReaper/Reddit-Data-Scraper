    "postText": "So first of all I was at my desk watching YouTube, my video ended and all I hear is sex noises and I'm in complete shock and fear. I don't handle awkward and uncomfortable situations well so I consult my friend and he says to run out of the room. I indeed run out and go to workout for a while to clear my head.\n\nNow I'm back and in a zoom meeting and I want to go about letting him know about my boundaries and to not do it again but I don't want to make things more awkward and I don't have the confidence to speak up about things.\n\n Any advice to help me?",

I'd recommend doing it now, rather than when you enter the workforce and have to have these same types of conversations with coworkers or bosses.\n\nI've seen some people never learn the skill and they get walked all over in their job because they don't want to speak up or have an uncomfortable conversation with someone.\n\nMost people aren't out there trying to make you feel uncomfortable so half of the issue is just letting them know it made you uncomfortable to begin with.",

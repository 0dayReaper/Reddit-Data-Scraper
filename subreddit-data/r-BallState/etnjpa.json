Make sure you understand how to use quotes and citation correctly- I think they have you reference an article in your writing. If you\u2019re worried you can always stop by the writing center and see if anyone has advice for you.",

I did a five paragraph essay (intro, main point 1,2,3 and a conclusion). \n\nI had a professor who said he used to grade the exam. He said that honors students and English majors were most likely to fail simply because they overwrote and lost any semblance of organization. \n\nI went in blind and just made sure to make sure my email essay was organized and threw a few big vocabulary words and it was fine. \n\nIf you are really stressed, try and take closer to the 60 credit hours mark than the 90. That way you can take it again if need be. \n\nDon't worry too much though, you've got this!",

Like everyone said, just make sure you know how to write a coherent essay and how to properly cite evidence and you'll be fine.  I think I printed out my article a week in advance and then just underlined and marked stuff that got my attention.  Marking up texts makes things a hell of a lot easier in my experience so if you think that will help, do it.  If you don't pass after 90 credit hours I think there's some seminar you can take but I don't know a lot about it.  \n\nYou've been given good advice in this thread!  Good luck and don't stress too much!!!",

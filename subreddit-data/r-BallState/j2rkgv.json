The class isn't structured well. The professor is basically there to answer questions and have no control over the class structure. You pay for the book that has the class built into it. I didn't get much out of it because of that.\n\nIf you're someone who gets a lot from a textbook and can memorize facts easily, then you'll probably get more out of it. Unfortunately, gen eds are mostly there just to be there imo.",

I took it as an 8 week class (not sure if it's offered for the full semester) but was able to get most of the work done the first few weeks of the semester before other work started piling up. From what I remember, the assignments were generally pretty short, with the exception of one project where (I think) you had to track your spending for a few weeks and analyze your spending habits or something. It was an easy class, but I do feel like I learned some stuff from it though.",

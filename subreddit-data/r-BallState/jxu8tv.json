If it matters, I have a VPN and I\u2019m connected to eduroam. Is this happening to anyone else or is it just me? Any advice or solutions?\n\nUpdate: It appears to be just Canvas. Other websites are opening just fine.",

If you haven't you should try messing around with your VPN to see if that's causing the issue and if it is, switch to a different one \n\nThe other things I might recommend right off the bat would be using another buildings wifi, or using the canvas app on your phone (assuming that you're using a browser on a computer right now). You could also try using a different browser to see if it's just that specific company that's having trouble connecting with the canvas servers.\n\nI hope this helps! I'm by no means a tech wizard so I'm sorry that I can't give you more in depth help",

These are the visiting hours.\n\nTues\u2013Fri: 9 a.m.\u20134:30 p.m.\nSat: 1:30 p.m.\u20134:30 p.m.\n\nAnd no it really isn't weird, plenty of people go in an wander around. Not sure how many people are there during the day due to covid, but no one there will look at your weirdly or anything. And all the employees I've seen are college kids and are chill, as long are you aren't annoying or fucking with the art, then they might yell at you.",

            "comment": "I just graduated from the CS program. Many of the professors are kind and accommodating, and will work with you to help you do well. With that being said, the content taught in the classes isn't entirely comprehensive, so you'll also need outside experience to develop your skills. Ball State has a student organization called Digital Corps that hires aspiring software developers to work on projects around the campus. I never worked for them, but I heard a lot of good things about them so I would highly recommend at least checking them out. If you have any more questions feel free to DM me!",

We had a german professor (can't remember his name) who took a poll of people's experience, which, being intro level ranged from none like me, to a few people in their 30s and 40s with real job experience. He chose to teach to those people's level. Me and several others quickly fell behind and had to switch majors. I really hope that guy is no longer there",

Others have was it that while the course work isn\u2019t terribly complex and will help you grow, you\u2019ll need to dedicate time outside of class to learn more about what you enjoy. \n\nI loved messing around with Arduinos and building websites which helped me grow more than the classes potentially. Overall my biggest suggestion is find a niche in CS you like and it\u2019ll make the learning process so much better!\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and I\u2019d be happy to help!",

The coursework and load was easy when I was there, I know they\u2019ve made some changes but it wouldn\u2019t be what I consider difficult. I agree with the other comment about doing some work outside of your coursework: side projects, open source, etc. This is the same at just about any other non target CS school in the country. \n\nHowever, I would not waste my time with the digital corps. When I was there it was difficult to get a job unless you knew someone who already worked there. \n\nI suggest focusing on internships and side projects, that\u2019s what I did and it\u2019s paid dividends for my career growth. It\u2019s extremely possible to get an internship and job at any big company (Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc.) as a student and graduate of BSU.\n\nI suggest checking out r/cscareerquestions or r/experienceddevs for other general advice regarding CS.",

Call Sami there and she can answer any of your questions. They're pretty close and the mits stops right in front of the apartment and the campus bus is super close to",

I never had problems there aside from neighbors upstairs who walked like elephants (but that's part of apartment living most of the time unfortunately). We had a 3 bedroom and I paid $325/mo for the master bedroom (other 2 paid $300).",

    "postText": "This past weekend, I was up near Muncie and decided to drive through campus as it has been about 4 or 5 years since I'd been able to do so. I must say, Ball State is looking great. \n\nMy only sad moment was when I passed by LaFollette, or what remains of LaFollete. I lived in Brayton/Clevenger for two years and made some lasting friendships while there. And although it was nice to see my old home one more time before it's eventual demolition, I couldn't help but feel bummed for the end of an era.\n\nSo, current students and alumni alike who lived in there, if you're so inclined to share: What's your lasting memory of LaFollete? \n\nCHIRP CHIRP!",

Shit, my *dad* lived in lafollete, near when it was first built. I was born on bsu campus at the hospital.\n\nI only had a year there before I went to Kinghorn and then off campus my last two years, but it wasn't that bad at all. I do remember things being more open than in Kinghorn.\n\nI was a bit of a recluse in college outside of my immediate friend group so I don't have any fun dorm memories really, most everything I did was off campus except for school stuff.\n\nedit: is somethingelsetv still a thing at BSU? anyone still going there pls confirm",

The community was great in Lafollette. It\u2019s only downside, in my opinion, was the lack of A/C. The potato soup in Courtside was great and my freshman year they had these incredible Freschetta personal pizzas in Out of Bounds. Some of my best Ball State memories were in Lafollette.",

At one point we set up a water balloon sling shot and shot water balloons over the low middle part of the complex and into the opposite court yards. Inside everyone always had their door open and you could just walk the halls and just talk with whomever you wanted. It\u2019s really strange for me to read some of the posts on this sub about people not being able to meet people or make friends now. That just seemed like such an impossibility at LaFollette. I\u2019m still friends with around 20+ people from my time at Ball State and I\u2019m pretty sure most of us met at LaFollette.",

Looking at different Urban Planning Programs and Ball State seems to be the best option because of state tuition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor people currently in/graduated from the CAP, what are your thoughts on the program? Do you believe it has/will adequately prepare you for your career and get you a job?",

While she did not end up working in that field for personal reasons, many of her friends easily found jobs. Some are still working in the field today, one is the town planner for McCordsville. She would tell you their programs do a great job and preparing you for a job in that field\u2026. She just chose to go a different route after graduation. Unless things have changed drastically, seeing as this was nearly 15 years ago\u2026 I would say it\u2019s still a good choice",

            "comment": "Getting a job shouldn't be an issue but Cincinnati and Michigan have much more rounded programs. \n\nIt certainly was more urban design and long range oriented and felt repetitive. \n\nIt also seemed like most of the professors either didn't have much real world experience or had been teaching so long they had checked out to a degree. It's almost all new professors now than it was then, so perhaps this has changed. \n\nIn any event, most of what you'll need to learn will be learned on the fly during your career anyway. You don't need a planning degree to enter the profession, and I would personally choose another more substantive major that gives you more options. Once you enter the field and get AICP (which is a joke in and of itself), it will nullify any perception related to the lack of a planning degree.",

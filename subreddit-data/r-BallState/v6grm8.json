From what I've heard there are few good professors so definitely hunt around for the least bad ones on rate my professor.\n\nAlso, LibGen and zlibrary will keep you from paying for 99% of textbooks. I recommend going to class and seeing if you even need to get a textbook because most of the time you don't. Especially in CS. Look out for reviews that say professors provide materials and take courses from those profs. Profs that provide resources = they give a shit. Profs that have required textbooks are almost always the worst professors because they don't actually know what they're doing (which is most of them, for the record). Dig for the gems, it's so worth it.",

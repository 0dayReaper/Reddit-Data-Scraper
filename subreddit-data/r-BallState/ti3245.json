    "postText": "Sleep and Self Efficacy [IRB# 1873572-1]\n\nAs a graduate student in psychological sciences at Ball State University, I am calling all undergraduate students to complete a short 15 minutes Qualtrics study to help us understand how self-efficacy and perceived stress as a college student relates with your sleep habits. \n\nThe study can be completed remotely, and at the end you will be given an equal opportunity to receive one of 50 $10 e-gift cards. \n\nYou must be over the age of 18 and enrolled actively in an on-campus undergraduate program at a U.S. college/university. \n\nIf you have any questions, please contact me (Student Invesitigator) at vdesai@bsu.edu, or Dr. Thomas Holtgraves (Principal Investigator) at 00t0holtgrav@bsu.edu.\n\nSurvey Link: https://bsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8nT8Jaz8octuk1U",

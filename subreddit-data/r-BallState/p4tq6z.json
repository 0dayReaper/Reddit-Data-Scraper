    "postText": "I\u2019m staying in the Anthony university apartments for the first time this year and am very excited but a little worried about space. I watched the walkthrough video and it seemed like the bedrooms didn\u2019t have much space for a bed and desk. I haven\u2019t seen it in person so it may just be the way it looked in the video, but does anyone have any advice about Anthony apartments or space saving tips in general? Thanks",

In that apartment one of them had a twin bed with a shelf unit over one end of the bed and a small desk fit in with some more to spare.",

That'll likely make it feel like you have plenty of enough space but I had roommates who has full size without issues. And yes, a twin narrow is just enough to \"share\" for the evening.",

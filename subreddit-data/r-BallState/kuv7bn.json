    "postText": "Apologies if this is a stupid Q. Last semester all of my classes were rather accommodating all things considered, and it was optional to attend online or on campus for the most part. \n\nWill this be the same for Spring \u201821? I did my best to sign up for mostly online, but I have two that say they\u2019re on campus and I\u2019m concerned, as I\u2019m high-risk and don\u2019t particularly want to be on campus much if I don\u2019t have to be.",

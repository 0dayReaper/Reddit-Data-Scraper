    "postText": "I'm thinking about living in the University village next year and I saw a bunch of mixed reviews on Google and Facebook. I was wondering what your experience was/is at the University Village and if you would recommend it. Specifically on how easy it is to shuttle to campus, the management and the apartments themselves. Also if neighbors are sociable and if the company sets you up with decent roommates through the roommate search.",

I've heard other people saying great things about it, and they can go though your financial aid. We are looking for a forth person and are probably going to roommate match. The matching is like a three page survey asking likes and dislikes, all the standard stuff, then they will let you know who you could match with. However all of this being said we still haven't lived there yet, just going though the process for August.",

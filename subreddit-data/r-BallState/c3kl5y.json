    "postText": "I'm a sophomore at BSU this year (econ gang rise up) and I've decided to live on-campus again. However, I know that I'm going to want to live in an off-campus 1 bedroom apartment during junior and senior year. Does anyone have any recommendations? I'd prefer a place that is very close to campus and isn't a party destination. I looked at the Village Promenade, but they're very expensive and have some bad reviews that make them look kind of shady (sending debt collectors after students who have already paid). I've also looked at an online tour of the BSU on-campus apartments and they just look like single dorm rooms.\n\nAlso, when should I start looking to sign a lease? Is May too late?",

Also, I doubt you\u2019ll be able to find many apartments near Ball State that don\u2019t reek of weed 24/7, so be prepared for that.",

The orange loop has a stop close by, and it's a pretty short walk to most of campus. It was 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and was $300 a month except for the master bedroom which was $325.",

            "comment": "a couple years back I worked for an off campus rental company for a couple years that rented houses, duplexes, apartments, you name it, and learned a ton. First off, the dorms are the worst \"bang for your buck\" available so hightail it outta there. The Village Promenade is likely the most expensive and unnecessary option and unless you are a foreign exchange student with no financial limitations. \n\nYou can find some decent deals if you wait till May, but you will have very little selection (roughly half of all housing is already signed on by the end of December for the following school year). This leads to companies offering large gift cards for signing, etc. to try to fill their vacancy rates. \n\nJust like in any market, it's all about location, so the farther you are from campus, the better the deal you will get (unless you go with a super apartment complex like Vie). \n\nHouses are very affordable to rent, however you need to know that you are living in MUNCIE INDIANA, and to not set your expectations too high for a college house. Although you will get the most sq. footage for your buck and have a lot more private space. \n\nA lot of this is dictated by your income, transportation means, and quality of living standards, but there really are options for everyone. Look early and often to know your options and ALWAYS remember that once you sign your name on a lease, you are legally bound to paying that for the full time and companies will make it very difficult/ near impossible to get out of those agreements once they are signed. Just be sure of yourself and situation before signing. If you have questions about specific areas/ companies/ etc. feel free to let me know and I'd be happy to help.",

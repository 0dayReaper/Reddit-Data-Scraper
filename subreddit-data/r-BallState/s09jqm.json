On one hard, this is good, because this is how software development works in the real world. On the other hand, it lets a lot of people half-ass their way through college and get a degree they aren't qualified to receive. If you go to class, don't copy your homework from Google, and pull your weight on group projects, you'll be set up well to get a good software development job or go onto grad school.",

I\u2019m pretty sure the department head has changed since I attended and hopefully that made a positive impact.\n\nThat being said if you\u2019re looking to work at a FAANG or similar company you can attain it through BSU CS. I suggest you look at r/cscareerquestions or r/experienceddevs for cs related info. Those subs can be somewhat unrealistic/unreasonable but they generally have good advice.",

The transition to working in software engineering afterwards is easier than in some other colleges I've seen my friends go to or have hired interns from. So it does a good job in that regard if you want to go into programming. \n\nThe hire level of company you want to go for, the more time you'll need to put in outside of classes working on data structures and algorithms and personal projects that can show off your skills to potential employers. You can also get a job not doing all of that if you learn it well enough in classes.",

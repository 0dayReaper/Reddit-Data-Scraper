    "postText": "Mandatory attendance is stupid. I don't know why professors still do this especially after 2 years of covid. The student has already paid for the class. Literally tanks your grade and is so inconsiderate of students who have to work and or have classes on the other side of campus that starts less than 10 minutes after the class ends.",

Dude took attendance the minute class started, and if you showed up after he was done taking attendance, he booted you from the class for the day. So not only would you miss the points, you\u2019d miss the day\u2019s lesson, too.",

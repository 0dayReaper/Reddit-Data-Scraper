    "postText": " This feels like kind of a long shot, but I guess I'll go for it: if you are seeing this and have been a graduate student in Ball State's history department post-COVID, would you be willing to share your experience (either here or through PM)?\n\nI went to Ball State for undergraduate history and am considering going back for my master's. So I have some sense of the people/culture there, but I'm interested in how things look from the graduate perspective.\n\nIf more direct/specific questions would help, I'm happy to do that - just let me know!",

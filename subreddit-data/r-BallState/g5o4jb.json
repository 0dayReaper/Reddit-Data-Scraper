    "postText": "I was recently admitted to BSU's Social Psychology MA program for fall 2020 and I'm really inclined on going to school here. I got my BA in psych at UC Davis last summer, and I've never lived out of state either. \n\nI just wanted more information on grad student demographics and how Muncie is as a town as well. Davis was particularly small but from what I've researched online, Muncie is definitely smaller. I wanna know more about the program specifically as well, since there isn't too much information on the site and it'd be good to get grad student testimonials on the program. The site also talks about how the program's outcomes are career-wise, since I want to go into Human Resources or Marketing after I finish my degree. But there's no statistics or graduation retention rates so I'm not exactly sure what people really end up doing after getting their MA from BSU. What is life like after the program?\n\nIf anyone was admitted to the program, but knows more about the area and the school, please let me know below or PM me as well!! It'd be great to connect :)",

I can weigh in on how the social and day to day aspect differs. Can't tell you much about your program (bc I'm not in it) although I hear great things about psych and the opportunities grad students have to work in very applied settings. RIP picnic day 2020",

    "postText": "Hey guys, me and my friend are looking for roommates for next year, we have 3 or 4 slots to fill, preferably 4. With 6 people rent is $317 per person, or with 5 people it's around $360. The house is huge, if you live in Johnson or in the neighborhood by there you'd definitely recognize it, its the one with the entirely glass front. Some of you may know it as the ski lodge!\n\nWe're pretty laid back guys, we like to party occasionally but usually we're just at our place hanging out and playing video games or watching movies. If you're interested in coming by to chill and see if you want to stay here, pm me and I'll give you my number!",

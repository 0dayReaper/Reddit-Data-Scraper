    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm currently a senior at Ball State and I am headed towards my student teaching next semester. I and many of my current peers have had a rather negative experience with OTES (office of teacher education services)\n\nI'm a student that sits on the Dean's Advisory Board. At the last meeting on November 17th, I bought about these concerns that the OTES office has been unhelpful and sometimes very rude to the students. The Advisory Board is now asking for other students' experiences they've had with the OTES while waiting for their student teacher placement. I have written up a survey that I would greatly appreciate if you would take the short amount of time to fill it out. I know that some students can be nervous about putting their names out there to tell their experience, but this can remain completely anonymous unless you state that you are ok with having your name on any email or survey you fill out. Please consider that these shared experiences will hold a higher meaning if we have names to place with them. If you wish to add your name to the survey please do so at the very last question.\n\nI also wanted to put this survey here on Reddit because I would like to gain the response from past graduates on their experience when it came to working with this office during the time of their student teaching. when you fill out the survey if you could at least put down the year you graduated that would be immensely helpful and help establish a pattern.\n\nThank you!\n\n Survey:  \n[https://forms.gle/RZ7PC52dC11nvD1t8](https://forms.gle/RZ7PC52dC11nvD1t8) ",

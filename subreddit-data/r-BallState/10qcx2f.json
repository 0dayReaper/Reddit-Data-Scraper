    "postText": "i don\u2019t usually use reddit but gee whiz i am terrified of not finding a roommate for next year. i already renewed my lease for my current apartment for next year and if i don\u2019t find a roommate i have to pay both rents. my current roommate is graduating in may so that\u2019s why i don\u2019t have one already. i\u2019ve posted on the facebook groups but to no avail. \n\nthe apartment is great!! i\u2019ve lived here for a couple years. it\u2019s the upper unit of a house. it has 2 bedrooms, one bathroom, washer, dryer, dishwasher, and AC. it\u2019s a block away from a blue loop stop so it\u2019s a good location. the common area furniture and most kitchen supplies (dishes, pans, blender, etc) are mine so you\u2019d pretty much just need stuff for your room! rent is $500 plus utilities. \n\ni\u2019m pretty easy going as a roommate. i like to keep the common space clean, but you\u2019ll often find my room is a mess. i typically like hanging out at home but having the occasional party or going out is always fun too. i have a small dog. she\u2019s scared of new people but once she knows you she\u2019s a love bug. she\u2019s super sweet. \n\nif you have any questions message me for my number or facebook. i\u2019ll put pictures of the apartment in the comments if i can (idk how reddit works lol)",

If you don\u2019t care about having a flashy laptop and want a reliable one that will stick through your assignments and college shenanigans, I have a lenovo thinkpad and i love it! \n\nit\u2019s not the prettiest so i just cover it in a bunch of stickers lol. i can also run games like the sims and stardew valley on it, as well as get my assignments done, however i don\u2019t do much extensive work on my laptop either. \n\nedit: i own a X270; it was about $300 with a discount but looking at the retail price it is $400-500",

Can do anything you need for school (which doesn't take much lol) and you can play some games on it if that's your thing, like I can run overwatch on high settings. Only bad thing is the battery is pretty bad and needs to be plugged in a lot of the time.",

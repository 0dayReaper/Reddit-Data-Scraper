I had a buddy who was from Kokomo and as far as BSU was concerned he commuted to campus, though in reality he lived in an apartment in Muncie.\n\nIn reality though, the freshman dorm experience is really something worth taking part in IMO.",

I would honestly just reach out to the student housing folks and ask about it.",

I do know that it is difficult to get a single as a freshman, but you could always look at using a double as a single if you have the money for it.\n\nAs long as you live within 60 miles of campus you are allowed to commute, but I would recommend staying on campus because it tends to let people build their identity separate from their families, which has been good at least for me.",

I had this thought doing a worksheet in a general astronomy class when from behind me I heard \u201chey do you know how to do this?\u201d And the other girl responded with \u201cno I just drew a catfish\u201d then she got up and turned it in.

If you get in you may be thrilled you made it but you may struggle with the independent work load. Knowing how to properly take notes and budget your time for studying can mean the difference between a 2.5 and a 3.5",

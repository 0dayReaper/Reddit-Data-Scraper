    "postText": "This is somewhat of a random question but for some reason I keep wondering about the habits of the geese on campus. I saw quite a few with goslings at admitted students day, and I wanted to know if they generally are more or less defensive/territorial as your average geese or does the number of students affect their behavior? Are they on campus year round or only in the warmer months?",

Either way that\u2019s a very rare occurrence for my case and they USUALLY leave you alone if you ignore them.",

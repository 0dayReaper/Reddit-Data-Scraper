    "postText": "Hi everyone! \n\nI\u2019m a junior majoring in computer science and have been thinking about working on a project for a long time. I want it to come back and help the community and one of the issues I\u2019ve felt and heard about at Ball State is the social scene, primarily local music creators and hosting events. \n\nBack in the 80s and 90s, local music and concerts at Ball State had a huge effect on the social scene and made it extremely active. I feel that now though, it\u2019s no where near what it used to be. My idea is to create a localized website that allows artists to host a page that talks about who they are and such. Once they create their page, people can go on to the website and go to a band page where they can talk about them, see upcoming events, and let\u2019s say you\u2019re a venue owner, reach out and see if the band would want to schedule an event. The home page would feature upcoming events and the details about those. That\u2019s the basics I would want to include and I\u2019m sure much more down the road if this takes off. \n\nFrom that comes the question, how many people would want to use this/think it might have a positive effect on Ball State? My concern is that people would rather use things like Facebook since it\u2019s larger which I would understand. But I\u2019d love to just gauge any genuine interest and if I feel I might have some interested users, I\u2019d start planning it out and working on it. \n\nThanks to any and all who take time to respond, all responses are welcome!",

Like we made a web app for a non-for-profit time sharing service. Some groups worked for a big companies in the area. Another worked for an academic adviser making a class scheduling app. I'd check with the department chair/one of the teachers who teach the capstone (when I was there, there were only two profs who taught it)",

I\u2019d love to try and bring some more life to Muncie/campus. I\u2019ll reach out and see if it could be viable, Village Green Records would be the perfect partner for this.",

Things are slowly starting to improve but we\u2019ve got a long way to go. \n\nA good resource would be Travis Harvey at Village Green Records. He\u2019d be able to give you honest input about your idea from from someone with a vested interest in seeing the Muncie music scene thrive. He could also introduce you to local bands and venues that could provide input into what would work for them for such a site or even if they would use it. \n\nGood luck.",

Ball State used to be a huge pinnacle of community pride but something just kind of shattered it and it's never quite came back to anything it used to be. I'd love to potentially re-open that door and help bring some life back to campus/Muncie.\n\nThat's an amazing idea with talking with VGR, don't know why I didn't think about that but that's why I made this post! I will absolutely reach out to him and hopefully he can give some good input and open the doors to local bands/artists and what they may think about the idea.  \n\nThanks again and hopefully things might take off!",

Lots of nostalgia for past bands, past venues, and past times. I've been listening to just about nothing but old local bands non-stop since Monday. Now is great time start this conversation.",

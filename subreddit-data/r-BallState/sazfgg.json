    "postText": "Hi there, my name is Zander and I am a freshman studying viscomm (graphic design) i\u2019ve heard from other viscomm majors that it can be pretty taxing with the long studio classes and the possibility of needing to take summer courses. I\u2019ve been interested in graphic design for a while but I do already hold a position as a graphic designer and for decent money. I\u2019m thinking about a major change to NREM. Can anyone give me advice as to why I should or shouldn\u2019t? Thanks,\n\nZander Lawton\nHe/Him",

It's kind of a mix of architecture and urban planning. If you really are craving the science aspect it might not scratch that itch for you though.\n\nMy undergrad at a different uni was nrem, and while I really enjoyed it I came to bsu for LA after.",

It would deal more with video type of stuff as opposed to art, and you'd have to go through all the other required courses, but it's an idea. Ultimately, it's up to you and what you want to do with your future",

Contact other employers in this field and do the same thing. Some won\u2019t get back to you but others will and will be able to offer you some advice. They will definitely have some thoughts on what you need to learn in order to be successful in the field. Then you can find out which major will best prepare you for that field based on the answers you received from employers. Beware of faculty or academic advisors as many times they will be trying to sell you on whatever degree program they are part of. Not always but it is something to be aware of. \n\nAlso, if the thought of long hours and summer classes are what\u2019s turning you away then you\u2019re going to have issues going forward regardless of what major you pick.",

They charged my boyfriend for an entire carpet replacement because his carpet was \u201cdamaged\u201d when it wasn\u2019t and already had old &amp; nasty carpet when he moved in. I live in one of silvertree\u2019s other locations and it\u2019s been okay, but definitely overpriced compared to other options available. Also avoid MiddleTown and BSU rentals!! My boyfriend just moved into a Campus Edge apartment and likes it so far/had positive experiences.",

Maintenance makes college students feel stupid when we request for them, and I speak from my experience and friends. Friends also had a problem with Silvertree not coming to fix things they put requests for. I don\u2019t know much about Campus Edge but it didn\u2019t seem all that bad based off someone I know.",

They charged me a full months rent for the month of August even though my lease ended on the 5th. They are just terrible and I would avoid them if you can.",

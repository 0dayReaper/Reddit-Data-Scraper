I don\u2019t know why, but for some reason I just got super into Pok\u00e9mon Go recently and was wondering if there\u2019s any fellow Ball State Students that would be down to play with me sometime so I don\u2019t feel as awkward walking around campus to hit up Pok\u00e9stops and to just have some company. It would be fun asf",

    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a freshman and I\u2019m thinking about moving off campus next year into University Village but I keep hearing that living off campus will really isolate you from the campus life. Currently, I live in the dorms and am rarely in my room at all. In addition, the village has a shuttle and claims to add a night bus next year. I was wondering what your experience is like off campus and if you would do it as a sophomore. Mainly, can you live off campus and still get the \u201ccollege experience\u201d?",

My wife probably could have saved $10,000 by moving her sophomore year.\n\nTo answer your question, yes you can still do things on campus while living off. Also, you experience different things living off campus as well. I transferred there and I never lived in the dorms and I met all of my friends either through class, roommates or neighbors.",

            "comment": "IMO better as a sophomore to use your resident hall \"seniority\" over the incoming freshmen and get a newer/more central dorm. And given you don't have a solid friend group yet, stay on campus another year to see what else materializes in terms of your social life next year. Then move off campus when you're a junior.",

I lived a 5 minute walk from the building 98% of my classes were in and thats as deep into campus I went. If you\u2019re friends with the people you live with, it makes it fun. I would suggest renting a house over an apartment, though... apartments are just glorified dorms.",

If you end up living far from campus or in another town then yeah, that\u2019s another situation all together. \n\nI agree with some of the others here though. Stay in the dorms another year and solidify that core group of friends if you can afford it. Then move to a house or apartment. Sophomore year you learn who\u2019s dorm room everyone\u2019s gonna run to when the cops bust the party. Next year you pre party at that person\u2019s apartment. Or don\u2019t. You do you boo",

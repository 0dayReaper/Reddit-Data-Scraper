When I go to that tab it\u2019s telling me to log in and then says failure but I don\u2019t even get a chance to log in. \n\nI called the help desk but they are closed until Monday. And I need to turn in an assignment",

In the help menu in Canvas is a 800 number you can call and see if they're able to see what's up.\n\nThe issue looks like something between Microsoft and Canvas instead of BSU and Office so hopefully they can see what's wrong and correct it. If they can't, you can of course download the file onto your computer and upload it. It's more tedious, but it'll get you by for that assignment while everything is closed for the weekend.",

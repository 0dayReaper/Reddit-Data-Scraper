    "postText": "I got a two-room apartment at scheidler, and I need a roommate. With two people rent will be $375 per month per individual (it's $749 for the whole unit). Includes wifi, utilities, and a shuttle that goes to and from BSU. You can have a pet here as well provided you pay a fee each month.\n\nIf you're interested, please either comment here or DM me directly. While I would prefer someone who is quiet, I am willing to live with almost anyone, as I am flexible. Thank you!",

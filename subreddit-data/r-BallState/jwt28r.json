    "postText": "So I showed up to a BSU home game a week ago and I found out that apparently they had a limited number of seating and tickets available, and that I couldn't just show up and watch. That being said, it looked like the people at the gate just kinda got their temperature checked and were allowed to go in. Has anybody been to a game since these changes started? Do they actually check, or can I really just walk in? Any information is appreciated.",

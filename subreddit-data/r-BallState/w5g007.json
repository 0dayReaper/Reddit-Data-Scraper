I\u2019m paying for college all on my own and knowing that I have options is helping me be less stressed about all this.

You might have some luck at Lowes or Walmart, which are both relatively close and pay better than some on campus jobs. You could also look for some remote positions on Indeed but you might have a hard time fitting that into your school schedule/availability.",

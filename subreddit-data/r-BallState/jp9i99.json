When I visited IU earlier this fall I was able to walk around but I couldn\u2019t really go inside any buildings. Is that what it\u2019s like at Ball State too? I\u2019m specifically interested in the teachers college and school of music if that makes any difference.",

In addition though I saw you mentioned being here on the weekend, some buildings are locked over the weekend (especially on Sunday) or specific doors are, so you may have a little bit of a game of trying multiple doors to get into certain buildings. This is the case with buildings like The Art and Journalism, Robert Bell, and Letterman building, which are all connected. Buildings like the Library, Student Center, Dining halls connected to dorms, and such will be open.",

As long as you wear a mask, you can pretty much explore freely. There will be some friendly students trying to reach out and meet you, but other than that you'll be fine. I probably wouldn't be the best for a \"tour\" bc I am just a freshman, but if you get lost or anything, let me know!!",

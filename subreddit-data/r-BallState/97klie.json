    "postText": "Hey folks,\n\nI have two books that I don't need anymore.\n\nOne is for ISOM 300 with Dr. Smith.  It's for Spring 2018, and she says that you NEED to buy a new edition of her book, but you don't.  She'll snap at you if she sees its different, so just play it cool and you'll be fine.  I've written and doodled in it, but you should be able to get by with it just fine.\n\nI also have Business Driven Data Communications by Michael S. Gendron.  It's fresh in the package, I never opened it.  \n\nSend me a PM if you want them.  First come first serve.",

    "postText": "I recently applied for a Student Life Counselor position at Indiana Academy and have been invited to interview. \n\nI am just...so insanely nervous. I've been looking to get back to Muncie since I graduated last year, and this is probably my best shot, and I just really don't want to mess this up. If you are someone who would be in a position to offer me any information that could help me go into my interview feeling a little more prepared (position-specific info, a read on the culture, *anything*), I would be eternally grateful.",

That makes me think it has high turnover. I would encourage you to ask in your interview why previous SLCs have left. That being said, if you\u2019re wanting to work for Ball State specifically, it\u2019s nice to get your foot in the door with any position\u2014especially if you\u2019d like to use the tuition remission to further your own education or for your dependents. However, if you\u2019re just wanting to get back to Muncie, you will be paid better most other places.",

The culture of the department/unit you work in really makes a difference, as well as having a good supervisor. I\u2019m in a staff position and it\u2019s been increasingly difficult to move to a professional position. Staff positions are grossly underpaid, which is widely acknowledged, yet no one can really do anything about it. If you\u2019re considering accepting a position, that\u2019s ultimately up to you on if the pay rate is something that\u2019s feasible. It\u2019s a government non profit entity, so pay rates are set and you don\u2019t have the flexibility that corporate for-profit companies have, like cost of living raises. That\u2019s the biggest complaint that staff employees have. I could make more somewhere else, but I\u2019m currently working on my Masters degree, which 90% tuition remission really makes a difference for. I plan to leave once I\u2019m fully vested in my pension plan at 10 years because I can\u2019t really afford to leave money for retirement/pension on the table. \n\nSo the positives: the benefits are pretty good, especially the vision and dental plans. I currently have a great supervisor, which has made all the difference. I\u2019ve been promoted twice and am slated for another significant promotion in a year or less. My supervisor has fought for that, which is why I say it makes a difference. Every unit/department has its flaws. There will always be people you don\u2019t gel with, so finding somewhere that you like your coworkers makes any job better. Ball State is a pretty inclusive place to work. There are of course exceptions, but overall it\u2019s a good place to work if you are part of a marginalized community. Post-pandemic remote work has been much more available, which has been really nice. Muncie is a relatively low cost of living city, so it is affordable. There are additional benefits and perks, you just have to take advantage of them. Overall, I\u2019ve enjoyed my time working at Ball State and it\u2019s helped advance my job. If you\u2019re not readily looking to advance in academia specifically or utilize the tuition remission, I suggest viewing it as a stepping stone than a stay-until-retirement plan.",

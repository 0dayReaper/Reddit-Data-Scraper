I'll be working at Ball Memorial hospital and I think they have a gym there but I need to sort out if it's enough of a gym to allow for legitimate exercise vs a treadmill in a stairwell somewhere.",

Ball Gymnasium is a building on the west side of the quad that served as the main gym/basketball arena/pool for the campus for decades until the arena/pool/rec was built. Now it houses a gym(workout center) and also includes a pool. The Gora Recreation Center (the rec) is on the north end of the middle of campus and is the newest and largest gym facility. I liked working out at Ball Gym because it's less crowded and I enjoyed swimming for exercise. A lot of profs/teacher types go there to avoid the mainly student swamp that is the rec. ",

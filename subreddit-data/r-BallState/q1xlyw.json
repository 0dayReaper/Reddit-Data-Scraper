            "comment": "My favorite Ball State date was when my partner and I rented hammock from the Rec center and set up a cute picnic in the quad. We brought a small bluetooth speaker (not loud enough to disturb others), dinner and some card games. \n\nYou could also go rock climbing in the rec, go bowling, go to a pumpkin patch, go see a movie or a play, maybe even a haunted house?? (not low-energy but a fun seasonal activity lol) Good luck :)",

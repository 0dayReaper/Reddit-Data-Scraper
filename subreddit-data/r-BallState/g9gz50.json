I guess I don't have any tips specific for Deho, but I do have tips for dorms in general.\n\n When I was a freshman, I came in with the expectation that my roommate and I would become best friends. In reality, we just didn't click, and I realized that's okay. If you don't become friends with your roommate that's perfectly okay too! I guarentee you will meet tons of other wonderful people in your classes, so don't put your eggs in one basket. \n\nAnother tip is to smile at people as you pass them in the hallway. When I did that, I began to recognize and become friendly with a lot of people on my floor! I'm extremely shy, so this helped get me out of my shell a lot. Also, the janitors at Deho are amazing, so make sure to say hello and thank them when you can!!\n\nI guess this tip is specific to Deho, since we have private bathrooms. Don't lock your keys in the bathroom! I've done this a billion times, and I had to ask a janitor to help. One time I had to wait outside the bathroom for 3 hours until someone could let me in lol. Just watch your keys!\n\nOne last tip is to please change out your washer and dryer lint after doing laundry!!!! A student forgot to do this last year and it started a fire. \n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Move your dresser and mini fridge underneath your bed. Don\u2019t leave your bed all the way at the top if you\u2019re remotely tall, you start to feel cramped up. Put it at about halfway height, it feels much more like an actual bed. Use either the window sill or one of your desks as a TV Stand (especially desk if you don\u2019t plan on studying in the actual room much, I didn\u2019t my freshman year). Just definitey experiment with moving your furniture around to make it feel more like a room and not a sectioned prison cell haha. You will enjoy the a/c, so definitely take advantage of that in August, and it\u2019s a good way to make friends with people in dorms without it by saying they can come hang out in your room where there\u2019s a/c",

My main ideas to hand out at are either FNF or scramble light. \n\nWhich place would you suggest I handout at? \n\nAnd what do you suggest I giveaway? I assume food is the best option, but I don\u2019t know exactly what to giveaway. I have around $300 allotted for it, so I want to make it good. \n\nThanks in advance! :)",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! \n\nI am a student currently enrolled in a senior capstone research class at Ball State University. My partner and I are interested in people\u2019s attitudes and perceptions and would like to invite you to complete our brief (5-10 minute) online study entitled \u201cAttitudes Towards Diverse Body Types.\u201d With this study, we hope to further understand the way stigma, age, gender, self-esteem, and social media use affects attitudes towards diverse body types. \n\nYou must be 18 years of age or older to take this survey. Your participation is completely voluntary and all responses will be kept anonymous. You will be asked questions about religion, gender, ethnicity, and attitudes toward help seeking behaviors. \n\nYour help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nIf you would like to participate in this survey, please follow the link below:\n\n[https://bsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_8ijZ2g1dCxGg0WG](https://bsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8ijZ2g1dCxGg0WG)\n\nThank you for helping!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKelsey Dunn, Investigator, [kbdunn@bsu.edu](mailto:kbdunn@bsu.edu)\n\nLeah Coffman, Investigator,  [lccoffman@bsu.edu](mailto:lccoffman@bsu.edu) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLinh Littleford, PhD, Faculty Supervisor,\n\nlnlittleford@bsu.edu",

Why would you do any of these things based on someone's body type alone? No one in their right mind would be willing or unwilling to recommend someone for a job without knowing more about them aside from their body type.\n\nSorry, this is an extremely flawed survey and OP is not possibly going to get any useful information out of this.",

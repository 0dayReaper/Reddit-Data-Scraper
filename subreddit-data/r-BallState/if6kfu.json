Some have delayed and some are having classes as normal. \n\nNot saying what BSU admin is doing is good or bad, but relatively few schools have gone online only at this time, relative to the total number of schools in the USA.",

Either way it seems like staying open is constantly risking an outbreak, and I feel that come regular flu season as soon as a good number of people get sick with anything we are probably looking at a shut down. \n\nI know this is a tough situation where the admin have to make tough decisions. I have no reference as they do in regards to what goes into planning all of this so I\u2019m not really upset, it just all stinks and I want everyone to be safe :\\",

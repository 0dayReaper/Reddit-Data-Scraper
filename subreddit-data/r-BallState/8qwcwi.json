It's not like they have unlimited money to give out. I mean if the committee told the group they didn't get money bc they are pro life then yes they'd have a case but it didn't seem that clear cut. Does the committee not have discretion in what groups they think are relevant and important to students. ",

                    "comment": "That was my thoughts too. They also don't present any evidence as to why they think other groups got that money over them. They just pick out groups that likely have opposing viewpoints to the SFL group and say \"what about them\". I know from being a part of leadership of a couple student organizations that the competition to get money from grants or various committees are pretty competitive, especially if you are asking for a relatively large amount of $300 (a lot of Student orgs don't even make or spend that kind of money in a year, much less at one event). To me this seems more like they are just upset that they didn't get money that they applied for. ",

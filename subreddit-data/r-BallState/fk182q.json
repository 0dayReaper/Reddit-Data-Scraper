I know BSU doesn't currently have an MLS program but if any current tcom grad students can give me a rundown or review, I'd appreciate it. \n\nWish I could be on campus again. Miss my old profs",

Several friends ended up at Accenture after they showed up prior to graduation. Other companies came too but I don\u2019t remember who, and I\u2019m sure that list has changed too. But it\u2019s a well respected program nationally.",

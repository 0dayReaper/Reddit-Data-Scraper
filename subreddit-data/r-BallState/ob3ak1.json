It is a treatment facility for youths; most have been placed here due to being involved the court system.\n\nThe main position is for Youth Support Specialists, which are the main adult figures in these kids lives. Staff are expected to watch them, like parents, and be good role models. There are other jobs on this campus as well, but not as high paying.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an easy job and can be emotionally difficult, but it is rewarding. The kids will be quite cruel when you enforce the rules to keep them safe, but then they can make the world seem so much brighter.\n\n  \nPart time is starting out at $14 and full time is higher. There is also a higher pay for different shifts.\n\nCheck out this website for more info:  [https://yocinc.exacthire.com/All\\_Open\\_Jobs\\_at\\_All\\_Locations?jobs=%5B%5D](https://yocinc.exacthire.com/All_Open_Jobs_at_All_Locations?jobs=%5B%5D)",

Work whenever you want, and you can pull a pretty decent profit most nights, especially weekends during the school year. Even on week nights during the year I\u2019ve been able to pull about $20/hr. It does help to have a car that\u2019s in good shape though.",

This shit isn\u2019t a fucking joke and fuck any of you who don\u2019t take this seriously. There\u2019s a special place in hell for you. Wear your masks and sanitize surfaces.

Did you realize that the peak of your life is in the past and now you\u2019re clinging to the hope that the long lost rush of having a high school party will return? Have you realized you have no personality, so you drink and party to hide those facts? I\u2019m so sorry. Please reassess yourself and your choices, especially in this pandemic. Save partying for later, mate. You\u2019ve got your whole life to do so. You\u2019re gonna make everything a living hell for the rest of us by being selfish. Suck it up.",

If both of you are in the honors college, you will end up as roomies in Dehority. The only reason you two would not be together is if one of you is an honors college student and the other is not.",

Architecture usually gets in park, which is probably the best one (best bathrooms, location, room size, etc.). So she should put her deposit down first if you want to get into that one. Comm is usually assigned Johnson A, which is a newer dorm but one of the worst locations on campus imo since it's so far from everything important. No gaurentees because at the end of the day there is some randomness to it, but I hope this helped!",

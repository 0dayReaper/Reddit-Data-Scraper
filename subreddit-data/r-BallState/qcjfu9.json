I remember the Stus having sturdier furniture, but they were way more dated. I think Park is a good middle ground because from what I\u2019ve heard, everything new down by the Johnsons, while nice, have paper thin walls. Park is a very quiet, relaxed dorm, and is known for being nice on the inside.",

They are almost 1.5 times larger than a standard double, and they have their own bathroom for just that room so you only have to share with a roomate. The closets are also bigger and deeper.",

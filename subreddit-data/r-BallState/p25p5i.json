    "postText": "I'm applying to go to Ball State in the fall of 2022. What are my odds? I have a 2.8 cum GPA. Any class I had a D or an F in,5 in total, I have retaken to get 4 As and 1 B. I already have an associates degree, it's in general studies. My target major I have already shown to be good at, I got an A in the one class my CC offered(Japanese 101). Additionally, I know for sure Ball State accepts credits from my CC and for what it's worth I'm transferring out of Virginia. Also, I have a letter of recommendation.",

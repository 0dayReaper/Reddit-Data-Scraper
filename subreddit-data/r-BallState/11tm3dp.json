Also try to stay around 14-15 credit hours, i did 18 when i started and that was rough.  \n\nFor textbooks, check chegg and amazon, also wait till the day of class to if it is really needed. \n\nBall states does have a move in list for the dorms i used that and that worked awesome for me. I rented a microwave and fridge from them as im from out of state so it was easier. Bring like a mini waffle maker/ or mini crock pot of you want to cook but if you live on campus its easy to get food.",

Get off campus and enjoy the city. Go see Emens shows that are crazy cheap if not free. Rent a bike and ride the Cardinal Greenway. Climb the tree in front of the art museum. Explore the woods and greenhouses. Make it a goal to fully explore every building by the end of Freshman year",

Like, go a little out of your way and make their lives easier, talk to them, get to know them. Don't take them for granted. \n\nJan, who worked the register at Noyer while I was there saw us at the bar one night and bought us all a round. Faye, our janitor for the floor, would come and get our trash from our room if the door was open when we were sick. If you take care of them, they'll take care of you. Plus you all kinda live together, so you really owe them anyway. \n\nAnd my last, maybe most important advice: GO. TO. OFFICE. HOURS. Make sure your professors know you by name AND face. Show them you care about the class and subject. If they know you're trying, if you get mono like I did, they'll be more willing to work with you when you miss class/homework.",

MAKE SURE  to see if any future classes have prerequisites for your major\u2026 i\u2019m paying the price by not taking those classes my freshman/sophomore year\u2026 Look up your professors on rate my professor, it\u2019s never failed me. ALSO if you have any questions - email your professors without hesitation until you understand.  Use the library!! you can rent books for classes from their website (bsu inter library loan)! DONT FORGET\u2026. your advisor is there for YOU.. schedule appointments before you schedule so you know exactly where you\u2019re at, they can send you to other people who can get you into classes if it shows you can\u2019t sign up for them.!!\n\nbring allll the clothes, food/snacks that don\u2019t always need to be in the fridge (unless you\u2019re bringing a mini one!) Youre going to spend a nice amount of time in your bed\u2026 the mattress topper is worth it\u2026 \n\nAVOID FIJI - they are weird, lame parties &amp; the way the house is set up\u2026 they just stare down at you on the dance floor \u2026 weird\u2026 DO GO TO SAE/EX (sigma chi), great parties. ALSO avoid the tinder boys who can go to the bar when you can\u2019t\u2026 there\u2019s a reason they are on tinder/bumble/grindr, yfm?\n\ncommon themes: luau/beach, rave, halloween costume, white lies (right an obvious truth on a white t-shirt, toga night (just wear white), SKI LODGE AT SIG CHI IS A BIG PARTY SO FUN!!!!! \n\nall in all, ball state is great\u2026 while i\u2019m READY to graduate this summer (didn\u2019t take the pre reqs when I should\u2019ve lol) \u2026 I will miss the amazing atmosphere \n\nfeel free to dm if you want any specifics on freshman year classes, I had pretty good luck w professors !!\n\nEnjoy BSU sugar!! chirp chirp!!!",

Sometimes advisors will recommend you to take a class before the prerequisite like chemistry before algebra. It can be done but it is better to do it the other way around.\nI have a fear of public speaking and took speech online. Asynchronous classes were great for me bit a lot of students can\u2019t handle it. I write a weekly schedule with gradable assignment due dates, appointments, and goals. They have free counciling, dietary planning, free counciling, career advice like practice interviewing, career coaching, and so forth.",

You have to get special permission for it but I did and it\u2019s great, super chill and all I do is log my workouts and complete textbook assignments in Canvas. If you\u2019re fine with the PE but don\u2019t want anything TOO challenging take the walking class, I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s not too bad and that most of the grade is is for attendance.\n\n\nIf you have a class that\u2019s far away from your dorm and/or between the hours of 10am and 2pm, get to the bus stop earlier than you think. Most of the time the buses will be completely full and you\u2019ll have to wait even longer for them. I\u2019ve been late quite a few times because of it!",

            "comment": "It has been a while since I\u2019ve been in college, but if you can avoid an 8am class\u2026do it. Take it later in the day if you can. Those are the worst. I do remember some freshman/core classes are only at 8am sometimes but otherwise try for a later class if it\u2019s offered. Also, if you can, try and load classes in a way that leaves you with a lighter day of the week to catch up on studying, running errands, etc. That might be more doable later in college, when you are well into your major. But try if you can even your freshman year.\n\nThis was not as easy back in my day, but don\u2019t pay ridiculous prices for a textbook when you might be able to find it on Amazon or other website for a lot less. Find out how often the professor even uses the textbook. Sometimes they hardly even reference it. There are sunglasses work I\u2019ve never bought the textbook and still got an A or B\n\nDo not feel pressure to join a fraternity or sorority. Greek life is not as big a deal at Ball State as it is at the bigger universities like Indiana or Purdue. \n\nAgain, not applicable for your freshman year, but consider being an RA. You will get free room and board, your own room, and a stipend every month. It also looks really good on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 when you graduate yourself. And you don\u2019t have to be super authoritative, I did it for two years and was laid-back about all the rules unless somebody was really being an idiot.",

You can probably give the department office a call and check if they received it or when you might expect to hear back. Also it might be posted on the depth website how the admissions process works.\n\nNot sure if it's different for PhDs but I had to be accepted into the grad school, then accepted to the department, almost like two phases when I didn't realize that going in.",

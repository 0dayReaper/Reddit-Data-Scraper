I\u2019ve heard to stay around the university bubble, some realty companies are mediocre at best, and that there\u2019s not really much to do outside of campus. Taking everything I hear with a grain of salt since i loved it when I visited last spring. Wondering about apts cost and style that are closes to campus?",

            "comment": "A lot of grad students stay in the University apartments. They're not the nicest but they do suffice from what I've heard.\n\nThe University Village is nicer, but it's further from campus and has mixed reviews. Same for the Haven (they have the same management company).\n\nThe Village Promenade has it all, but it also comes with the highest price tag.\n\n\nAvoid Campus Rentals (formerly BSU Cribs) as well as BSU Rentals. They're both terrible companies that frequently rebrand to hide how terrible they are. \n\nThere are more options, but they require a little more searching.",

Or Grandview Square Co-op. \n\nI've been through a lot of housing and searching in the area over the last 5 years. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!",

Super close to campus, rent was 325 (2 years ago), and HUGE living room compared to most apartments I've seen. Loved that apartment, but you could hear the neighbors if they were loud and the chug on karaoke night. The landlords were easy to work with (owners of the tanning salon) and never had any problems with them.",

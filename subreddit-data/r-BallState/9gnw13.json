    "postText": "Hello all, currently a senior here and am trying to get in better shape through martial arts, preferably boxing. Started taking lessons and the summer and loved it more than any other workout I've done and it helped me to push myself. I was interested in the boxing club on campus, but I do not believe that it is functioning this year. I know there's an MMA class offered at the rec center but I'm not sure if I'm ready to jump into that, I'd like to stick to getting a solid base in boxing before I start branching out. If anyone has any suggestions/recommendations for lessons on/off campus I would greatly appreciate it. I hope you all have a wonderful day.",

Max is a high level blackbelt, one of the best guys in the state.\n\nOtherwise if you're looking for boxing the Pal Club is the only place I know of in Muncie. I have no clue about the level or reputation personally, but I've heard... not great things about some of the people there. This was years ago, things may have changed, but if you're set on boxing, check it out and make your own judgment. ",

We were one of, if not THE first state to finalize our results for Trump. Who are they protesting against? What is the end goal of these kinds of things? We gonna march to Michigan and join them in beating down the walls of the counting facility??? wtf",

The Trump people wanted to beat her up. The campus police got involved. At the moment there is a rumor that tonight at 6:45 Trump supporters are going to have a protest/ rally at the north side Walmart. There are fears that it might possibly turn violent. Merns sent an email out a little bit ago talking about the fears and said they are going to increase bussing, have more police patrols, and told student to not start a fight with the Trump supporters. Hope this helps.",

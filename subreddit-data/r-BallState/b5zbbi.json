    "postText": "Before attending BSU, I looked at a lot of apartment complexes because I wanted to find something clean and affordable. Overall,  I've had a positive experience when living in the Normandy Apartments on W. Bethel Ave. The rent is reasonable, there's a bus stop over by the stadium, and there's a laundry facility, too. The parking lot is a little tight, but I've never had difficulty finding a parking spot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince I've had a good experience, I figured I'd post on here if there are people looking for future apartments.

But Purdue is doing ok with covid, they have done way many many more tests than us and even do random testings. On top of these schools made every student get a test before hand where bsu didn't make anyone. People in dorm either had to take a test or say they self quarantined. \n\nBut I see by next Monday us going online for at least 2 weeks, maybe an announcement before closure like the first time. Announcement on Wednesday but classes still in-person till the weekend. But honestly I have no idea and we might not go online until Purdue or iu does.",

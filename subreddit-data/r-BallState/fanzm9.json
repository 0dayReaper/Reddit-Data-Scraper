I am particularly interested in breakfast places that open early, and lunch spots within walking distance of Bracken Library.  Thanks!\n\nAlso: No significant dietary restrictions worth mentioning.",

Depending on how far you want to venture from campus, Savages Ale House is fantastic, great tap list a d good cheap food, maybe a 5 minute drive from campus. \n\nAlso, Roots in the village is close enough to walk to from Bracken, kind of a burger bar type place.\n\nIf you're looking for the ol college experience Greeks Pizza and Brothers are right there in the village too. \n\nMT Cup (village) has good breakfast bagel sandwiches and opens early, good Dark Matter Coffee there too\n\nHave fun!",

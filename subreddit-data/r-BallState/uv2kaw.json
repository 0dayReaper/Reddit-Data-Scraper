They teach you how to use some parts of the software, but you're also expected to have some prior knowledge. You make videos in premiere, as well as importing audio from the audio app (which I can't remember the name of) into your videos. You use other adobe products like those mentioned prior to help in making your videos as well as other side projects. It's been a year since I've taken it so it's hard to remember, but I hope this helps!",

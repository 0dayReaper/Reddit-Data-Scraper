If they catch her making a double bed or using both sides early on, like first month, she can be charged for double occupation, but I've never heard of it happening to someone.\n\nIt is possible to be assigned a roommate but after the first month, it isn't likely. There is probably an avenue to be assigned a roommate or be willing to move into another room if she really wanted to be bunked with someone. You'd have to talk to housing to be certain.",

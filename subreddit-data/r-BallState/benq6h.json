    "postText": "Hey guys, I made a post on here a while back asking for roommates, and now we have 5 guys but we're looking for a 6th! Rent would be $317 a month, plus utilities. We have gigabit internet for $26 a month, and the rest of the bills are usually $100 if not less. We have a really cool house too, great for throwing parties every once in a while. All of us are really chill, we just hang out, play video games or watch movies, and study. If you're interested, shoot me a PM!",

One could potentially load these pdfs on a kindle or other e-reader.\n\nAmazon is a good choice for rentals though. Be weary though, I've bought used books from TIS before for roughly the same price as renting on Amazon. I recommend you look for books in person and compare online. \n\nNot to mention, certain majors have Ball State specific textbooks for some classes. Those will screw you over no matter what. Don't forget that you'll probably need online codes as well. If you buy the codes they typically come with a free ebook version of the text.",

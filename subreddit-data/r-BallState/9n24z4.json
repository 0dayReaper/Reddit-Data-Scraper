    "postText": " I am on a task-force of a university that is looking into making our campus a tobacco-free campus. At our meeting today, Ball State was brought up as an example of a campus that prohibits tobacco on campus. Is Ball State truly tobacco-free? Is compliance high? I'm just  looking for input and feedback from people who are actually there,  day-to-day. Thank you! ",

            "comment": "I was a student there when that policy was implemented. We had designated smoking sections and smokers pretty much stayed in those sections. To make the campus \"tobacco free\" they got rid of smoking sections, so the smokers were forced to go off campus and random people's yards just off campus became the new smoking sections. They should've just kept the designated smoking sections because they were out of the way.",

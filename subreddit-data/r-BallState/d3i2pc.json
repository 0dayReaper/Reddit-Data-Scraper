I\u2019m currently wrapping up my BArch just starting my final year! \n\nThe best advice I could give is just know how to schedule time, some projects will take some time if you want to get to a solid product. I\u2019ve seen it done on time crunches but that typically involves all-nighters which from experience is not something that is fun to do lol \n\nIf you want to know any specifics or anything feel free to dm me and I can tell you more! \n\nBest of luck!",

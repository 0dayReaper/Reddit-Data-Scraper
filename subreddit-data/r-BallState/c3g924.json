Technically you can get in trouble if you use the name \u201cBall State\u201d anywhere associated with your club (have it in your usernames/bios on social media) but I mean as long as your club isn\u2019t something offensive, I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t run into problems. I\u2019ve started an unofficial club and I use Ball State and haven\u2019t ran into problems yet, but I\u2019m just warning you like I was warned!",

You'll need a faculty advisor, to attend a new student org meeting (asap because they don't have that many), eventually a constitution, and at least 8 student names and emails to be officially started. I'm sure there are a few other things but those are the big ones i remember",

I don\u2019t have a car on campus and I\u2019m looking for an apartment complex accessible and possibly furnished. VP ticks those boxes off, but the google reviews are shady! Hence I need someone living there to confirm their experience...",

Be warned though maintenance can be incredibly slow and try ro avoid a room thats close to brothers if you have early classes and need to sleep early",

The only problem we encountered was the ac went out for a week or so but this was because of a thunderstorm that struck the roof. This was out of their control and we received a reduction in rent as compensation. The immenities are very nice and it\u2019s central location is better than any other apartment complex in the area.",

It\u2019s definitely overpriced but if we all acknowledge that and move past it, it\u2019s a nice place to live! My only complaints were the trash chute in my building was clogged for like a month and it definitely started to smell. Also, there was a storm and my building was left without heating/air conditioning for like...two months. I like it enough to live there for another year!",

I'm a Music Media Production major, so I don't have any specific info for you on your major, but if you've already auditioned for the program, they should get back to you within the next month or two after auditions are done with (I think they're still going, they were on Monday at least). If you have any more questions, feel free to ask, and maybe I can find a jazz studies major for you (no promises tho!)",

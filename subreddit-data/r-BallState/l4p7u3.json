I am a current junior at Ball State and I'm spending this spring semester working for a CPA firm as an intern. With tax season coming up quickly, they have informed me that they are looking for someone to help scan documents (tax returns and the works). Tax season tends to be pretty busy for everybody, so they always bring somebody in.\n\nThey are looking for somebody to come in for about 10-15 hours a week, from February to about two weeks into April. They said that week to week, the days they may need you will most likely change, so if you have a pretty flexible schedule with classes, then that is perfect. They also know that college students are busy and can work around your schedule week to week as well. The job is located in between Anderson and Pendleton, so you will need transportation.\n\nI do not have all the details quite yet, but please message me for more information! This is short notice, so they are looking to hire somebody by Wednesday, January 27th. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested!",

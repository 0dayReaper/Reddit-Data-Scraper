If you are voting early you can go to any early voting place in the county you are registered in. So yes you will have to go back down there.\n\nIf you google \"where can I vote\" there is a nice little system where you can put in your address and it shows you your polling place for election day and early voting locations you can go to. As well as times.",

If you wait till election day you'll go to your assigned precinct which you should be able to find on your voter registration confirmation they mailed to you or you can find it online through several websites.",

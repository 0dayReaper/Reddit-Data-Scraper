I enjoy housecleaning and cooking and would be more than happy to clean and cook in exchange for rent, or to factor that in if at all possible. I\u2019m quiet (on days off, I like to sleep and listen to ASMR or play videogames!) and am not into partying or anything like that. PM me if you have an open room or know of any leads. I\u2019m looking for a 3-6 month lease around the Muncie area. Thank you! \ud83d\udc96",

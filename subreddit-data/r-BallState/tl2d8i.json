    "postText": "I lost my credit card today. Somebody at the business I lost it at turned it in to the Ball State Police.\n\nJust a few minutes ago, I get a call from an unknown 765 number. I pick it up, and get a \u201cWho is this?\u201d to which I reply, \u201cWho\u2019s asking?\u201d. They don\u2019t identify themselves and proceed to keep asking me who I am until they read my name from the card. I refuse to say whether or not that\u2019s me because *this is still an unknown number of a person who refuses to identify themselves*.\n\nThey *audibly sigh* and inform me that they\u2019re UPD. I confirm that the card is mine, at which point they ask where I am right now. I state that I\u2019m at my apartment. They ask for my address. I refuse, and offer to go down to the UPD office in person. They ask for my address again, and I refuse again. They then inform me that they\u2019ll leave it at the office for me to pick up.\n\nI didn\u2019t get a badge number, name, or any other form of identification, but this behavior is *highly inappropriate*. Any advice on how I can make a complaint?\n\nUpdate: I made a formal complaint with UPD.",

They might not get fired for it but they'll be in a world of shit if the call was recorded, what a fucking inconsiderate and not to mention unprofessional way to conduct themselves.\n\nalso, fuck the upd again for good measure",

If it was 765-285, it's a small list to go through to find out who's phone was used to make the call.\n\nIf it wasn't a 765-285 number, it was probably their cell phone.\n\nhttps://www.bsu.edu/about/administrativeoffices/police/report-a-crime-or-emergency/staffdirectory",

Good job reporting this OP. That\u2019s definitely not how that should have been handled.",

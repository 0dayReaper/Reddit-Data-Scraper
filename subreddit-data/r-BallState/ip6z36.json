That's part of college life is learning to be on your own and delaying gratification like say partying for studying.  Unfortunately, it takes a couple years to learn it and people just want to party.  \n\nYou are right though, some people never learn it.  That's sad because they say that is the main determining factor in financial success.  There is a famous Stanford study on it.",

            "comment": "I don't think the university is trying to lie to us, however, I think how the University is going about updating their \"Corona Board\" is a little ineffective and misleading.\n\nFor example, the board shows us that we are now at 800 cases or more. However, it's been more than **2 weeks** since the board was created. Therefore if we know that most students can heal (through self quarantining, social distancing, and adhering to CDC guidelines.) they should have enough time where they could of rest or recovered from Corona. Thus the cases shouldn't the cases be lower than they actually are?  \n\n\nMy friend brought this point up to me yesterday which changed my perspective, not the Ball State Corona website board. In conclusion, I don't think Ball State is lying about their numbers but they could be doing better at updating the numbers board as it doesn't really account for the fact that people are recovering from the virus therefore there could be less cases.",

                    "comment": "Another thing to consider is that the total number of positive cases according to their testing does not equal the actual total number of cases. Given the prevalence of asymptomatic cases and the common \"incubation period\" that some experience before symptoms show up, there are actually probably a lot of cases that have gone unreported. Especially since Ball State is requiring a checkup showing symptoms before you can get access to a test. \nEssentially what they're lying about by omission is that they're not actually equipped to handle this situation. If they actually can't afford to regularly test everybody (yes, everybody. Even people who think they're not sick), they should have been full online from the start. But there's no way to know what they're actually thinking and what metrics they're using to make the determination to close things down.",

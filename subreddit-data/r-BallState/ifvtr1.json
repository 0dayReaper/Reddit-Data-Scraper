    "postText": "Hi, can someone tell me which type of meal plan for off campus students is best for selection and flexibility? Are there places off campus that will take payment via meal plan? And what is the difference between Dining Cash and Dining plus? My son is living in an off campus apartment and the choices are kinda confusing.",

            "comment": "As a commuter I don\u2019t suggest getting any of them actually, unless your son plans to eat literally every meal on campus it just isn\u2019t cost effective. A lot of the food on campus is mediocre at best and even the supposed \u201chealthy\u201d options aren\u2019t really that healthy. Plus I worked in one of the campus dining options for a semester and trust me when I say in this time of COVID I definitely wouldn\u2019t trust them to be safe. \n\nIf you want to help him with food costs I would just give him grocery money if he has access to a kitchen. Not only does he get to eat better and healthier food, you save money. And it will help him learn how to cook, stock a kitchen, etc which is so valuable. \n\nI commute from about 30 mins away each day and stay on campus from 7am-7pm and I manage just fine without a meal plan. I make a lunch/dinner and bring a few protein bars or other snacks in case I need them. I believe there used to be fridges you could store your lunches in pre-COVID but I\u2019m not sure as I always just went non perishable food. \n\nAlso campus is probably not going to be open for all that long so, don\u2019t know how much use he\u2019d get out of the meal plan.",

What I had my mom do when I was in my first stint of college in Ohio instead of getting a meal card, I had her get me a gift card to a grocery store for the same value and did my own shopping, way more value for the money.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t recommend getting a meal plan at all. There is no discount to buying a meal plan, just convenience. Every dining hall accepts card or cash and buying a meal plan just locks him into spending $8.50 (or however much a meal swipe is up to these days), where as if he were paying cash or card, he could get a meal for $6.50 and not worry about wasting the extra $2.00 to max out his swipe. Regardless of how much the meal is, the swipe charges the same amount.\n\nEDIT: Another thing that\u2019s not widely known is that the main advantage to using a meal swipe is that it is not taxed. However, even when paying cash or card you can show your student ID to make it tax-free.",

Neither work anywhere off-campus so you\u2019ll still need money for groceries and stuff. On campus dining is really just good for before, inbetween, or right after classes for off campus people.",

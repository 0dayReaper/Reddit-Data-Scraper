    "postText": "Hi! My name is Hailee and I'm a freshman here at BSU and I'm looking for a study partner to meet up one or twice a week. I think I'd work better with someone else considering I tend to get on my phone or procrastinate. I'm a journalism major, an anthropology minor, and I'm taking a french class. If anyone is interested please message me! Thanks!",

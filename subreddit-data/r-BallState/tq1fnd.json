If you can, aim for $700-$800 range (or base model MacBook Air if you're an Apple person) and get something that will be good to use as well as last at least 4 years.\n\nEdit\n\nIf you can find a few year old good laptop for less from somewhere reputable, go for it too if you don't want or can't get something new.",

You can get a USB one that connects externally.\n\nYou should have a laptop for general use that can run a browser, a word processor, and the whole Office suite (there\u2019s going to be *one* professor who makes you use Publisher for no good reason). You don\u2019t need anywhere near top of the line unless you\u2019re going into video production or music production as well (or are using it for a gaming pc). I grabbed the cheapest ASUS I could get quickly my hands on and it\u2019s been just fine for Music Ed.\n\nOptionally, a tablet or e-ink tablet for note taking and storing your textbooks can be extremely helpful, especially if you don\u2019t want to lug around a ton of stuff.",

But I\u2019m education you may not need that high of a ram",

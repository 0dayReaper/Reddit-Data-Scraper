    "postText": "So I\u2019ve been accepted to both Ball State and Indiana University for next year planning to go with Meteorology/Atmospheric Science major. I have my list of colleges narrowed down to these two, and I\u2019m really torn on where to go. Both have similar prices for my family, and similar clubs/extracurriculars that I would enjoy. IU is obviously the more prestigious school, but it is also the larger school and I do have some questions about whether smaller, niche majors like mine are treated the same and given enough attention at IU. BSU definitely feels more navigable and I have the added bonus of a spot in the honors college if I were to attend. I\u2019ve visited both campuses, and Bloomington seems like the better town, it is so much bigger than what I saw in Muncie, where it definitely had a more personalized, home-y vibe. I haven\u2019t been around Muncie, although it does seem to get a bad rap as a bad or boring town. I\u2019m not necessarily a party person so the drinking scene, frats, and bars aren\u2019t as much of a factor for me in either city. Hopefully, if I could get thoughts from anyone whose been a student or alumni and give their pros and cons on the universities. I could see myself at both universities next year, but I\u2019m not sure which one is the right one for me. Thanks!",

The tcom/media department is one of the best in the country. If you want to work for the government or some sort of other private industry - either school's degree would suffice... but still go to Ball State.",

If there are any camps or study programs that would allow you access to instructors in those fields, sign up for those before making your decision. Get a feel of that specific department and go with whichever you feel most comfortable with.",

            "comment": "I graduated from Ball State in '18 but am originally from the Bloomington area and now live in Bloomington. While I do love the variety of opportunities for places to eat/things to do/etc. in Bloomington, Muncie has been improving a lot over the past decade or so. Between downtown and campus, I can't say that I was ever bored out of my mind, but your experience is what you make it.\n\nI've never been a student at IU but I did work orientation for them for a couple of summers after college. As a whole it does seem much more impersonal than BSU, not only for the smaller majors but in general due to the larger size. IU's campus is still manageable but BSU is a lot more walkable. When I worked orientation helping people craft their schedules at IU, we had to pay a lot more attention to the way things are spaced out because some walks are impossible in the time between classes. BSU has that problem in some cases but not nearly as often.\n\nAs for meteorology, definitely go with Ball State if you're looking to do anything related to broadcasting/TV. One of my best friends from college is a graduate of the meteorology program. He minored in TCOM and was a weatherman on NewsLink for several years. He had a lot of other opportunities for things like internships and even a storm chasing class over the summer one year. Had no problem getting a job after college - but, again, his experience was what he made it, as he took advantage of all those extra opportunities.\n\nETA: I was also in the Honors College at Ball State. It's debatable how much it was really worth it. I don't know that it's really made me more marketable in job searches, but I did appreciate being able to register for classes earlier and live in DeHo as a freshman. I also felt like I had more support from the Honors College faculty and staff (especially the advisors) than I did in my own major. However, I will caution that most of the required classes for the Honors College are humanities related, so if you're really not into history and classic literature, it may not be for you. I was a history major and still struggled with maintaining interest in some of the classes. Not sure if it's still like this, but when I was in the HC, they only required one science class as part of their curriculum. It's definitely more geared toward the humanities. I know that some other universities (not sure about IU for sure) just offer like \"honors versions\" of regular classes where you do extra/different assignments and that's it rather than the extra courses. Sometimes it can be difficult to fit the honors courses in with all the other classes you need to take.",

            "comment": "There's one thing I can tell you as a former Honors College student: mostly everything they tell you about the Honors College is a lie, so definitely don't let that be an influence on your decision. The Honors College dorm, DeHority Complex, is easily one of the most outdated and boring dorms on campus. Also, they say \"it's not extra work\" but that is also a lie. Ball State is wonderful for those smaller niche programs. I am a theatre education major which obviously isn't the biggest major in the world, yet Ball State provides us with really good opportunities and instruction. I will admit, though, that Muncie can be a mess sometimes. I don't know much about Bloomington, but you might feel more comfortable there.",

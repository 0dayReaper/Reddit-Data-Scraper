    "postText": "So there is a chance I will be moving to take a job at ball state. I know the town is kind of nothing but ideally I would like to live within 15 minutes of campus (driving). Looking for houses or even apartments online is returning nothing good. Is there even a decent apartment complex near campus that a non student could live in for a year or so (then I could work on houses when I am actually living there)???",

            "comment": "You should look into [Scheidler](https://www.bsu.edu/map/buildings/campus/scheidler-apartments). They are BSU owned/run apartments with all utilities included (makes it worth it and laundry building on premises) and a shuttle to campus. You can apply  and move in pretty much any time -- always openings, and they are good about letting you out of your lease early if you need. Close to campus but does not feel like you are on campus. Great community, very mature: mostly faculty who moved to the area and are looking for houses, graduate students, international students and their families, etc. Great spot for a year or two.",

Be careful with BSU rentals, Campus Edge, and Heather Clemmons; all three have had a lot of complaints.\n\n The closer to downtown, the more expensive it will be. It might be cheaper to find a roommate and just rent a house together.",

The apartment units all seem very well maintained and the front office is friendly too. They don't have a whole lot of amenities (no swimming pool, gym, etc.) but for me that's not really a big deal. So I'd definitely recommend at least checking them out.",

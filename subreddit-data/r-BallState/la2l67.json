It can\u2019t stop there because there is no bus stop (the divots on the side walk) near it. The way you take the bus to TC is by riding any of the buses [edit: literally any line: Blue, Red, Orange, or Green] on McKinley and stopping at the atrium/AJ. I hope this helped!\n\nThere is also an app you can get called \u201cTransLoc.\u201d It used to be Rider but they updated it/changed it. It shows the bus routes and exactly where you should get off and when.",

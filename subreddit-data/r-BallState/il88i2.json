Canceling in person classes will not cancel off campus parties and people will go to them.  You want proof of people already partying, look at that one guy the other day who posted about his party he had during welcome week with no one social distancing.  People have said that he had videos throughout the summer going to parties and no one social distancing.  I also feel though it will be less consequences to those who are partying if classes are online.  You can make a case to suspend or expel students who are not following guidelines if classes are in person.\n\nI feel like the better option would to have classes all online for two weeks, Ball State strictly enforcing no off campus parties and start suspending or expelling students having those parties and social distancing guidelines then go back in class.\n\nI feel like its better for stuff on campus to happen with strict enforcing social distancing and keeping watch of students.  The issue is that Ball State has been pretty slow in their attempts to slow down the spread of COVID.",

Why don't we offer everyone the option to remotely take courses?\n\nThe answer is it costs money to do all that and every time they make a decision it's a calculated one that considers both lives, harm reduction and dollars.

    "postText": "Hello I apologize for any spelling and or grammar mistakes in advance because I am type this on my phone. I was recently just informed by my hall director that my roommate has decided to move out of the dorm at the end of the semester. I do not know the process of what happens after this other then I either need to find a roommate or they might just shove someone random in my room when I come back for spring semester. If any of you guys have any ideas of how to locate a new roommate and or how the process is carried out if I can not locate a roommate I would appreciate it. Thank you in advance!",

            "comment": "This happened to me once.  Because people move out, quit, or fail out of school, the likelihood that you get another roommate is minimal, unless you live in one of the more coveted dorms. Enjoy the extra space. They may try to up sell you so that you pay for a double room for yourself, and just tell them that you\u2019re considering it, but don\u2019t commit. That might help them look elsewhere first, IF somebody needs a spot.",

            "comment": "I was a resident assistant at BSU and basically you have a double room to yourself. The catch is you are only supposed to be using half of the furniture in the room. (If you have no intentions of paying for the other half).  So don\u2019t push the beds together or fill up the other dresser with clothes. But you can re-arrange the room however you want. If the beds can be bunked I would recommend doing that to save the most space. At anytime they can move someone else in with you, if you don\u2019t pay the double room fee, but the chances of them moving someone in with you are pretty low. In 3 years I believe it only happened once. In my residence hall (Kinghorn)",

            "comment": "When I was a freshman living in Shales (lol it still feels weird that the place is torn down now), this happened to me.  She moved out a month into the semester and basically they told me someone might move in at any point during the semester or during second semester.  The rooms in Woody/Shales were pretty roomy even though it was in LaFollette compared to the nicer buildings so I kinda didn't want to give it up.  I eventually just paid the fee to keep the whole room to myself and used up the entire room.  I loved it.  I did get one email of a student looking for a new dorm room but I just genuinely wanted to live by myself.  She did end up finding a new room though, and a much better one than mine (LaFollette is a dump of course haha, but so many good memories).    \n\n\nIf you want another roommate though or aren't sure if/when you will get a new one, just do what other people have already said and don't use the other half of the room.  You might get emails from other students asking if you'd be interested in having a new roommate cause they're looking to move.  You also might get randomly matched and find a new person next semester.  Check your bsu email regularly to look out for students asking about new roommates or even ask classmates but as others have said, chances are fairly low depending on what dorm you live in. If you don't get a new person, they'll give you the option to buy out your room and use the double like a single.",

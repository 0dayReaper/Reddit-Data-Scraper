There can be time limits, but it should just be a button or something like that to reset the clock. If the meters here worked better, like they were for an hour instead of the awkward 45 minutes or the top floor of the garages were free as long as you reset the meter every hour, I\u2019d be fine. But the fact that the meters don\u2019t last as long as a full class so they run out before you can head outside AND they charge you a dollar for that short amount of time? It feels like it\u2019s designed for us to fail and lose money to sadistic Parking tickets. ",

Why should other people pay for you to park your car in an area with limited space?",

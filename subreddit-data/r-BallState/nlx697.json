What your major is does not have to define what you do with the rest of your life. Get a degree and connect with the right people/have a bit of luck to prove yourself",

The good part of some business degrees are that there\u2019s a ton of time in your schedule to go take classes in other areas. Totally possible to get a major in business and a minor in something more \u201cfun\u201d.",

It hasn\u2019t been as useless as it may seem but I definitely don\u2019t work in any field relating to faith or religion in general. \n\nBe careful on selecting a major based on something you \u201clike\u201d or a 100 level class you thought was cool and interesting. Not to steer you away from possible career paths but this can lead you to selecting a major with very little real world application. Some of the majors that people have mentioned are excellent options. Computer Science and Business Management are two great examples where you can take those degrees and really apply for literally countless jobs. The same can\u2019t be said for a Religious Studies Degree.",

It\u2019s really unique in the aspect that you can do almost anything you want with it whether it be automatic excel sheets, creating a fully automatic herb garden, making games/apps, and so much more!\n\nI just graduated and it\u2019s been a dream come true, I was able to find a job before I even finished classes which was a huge sign of relief. Obviously coding isn\u2019t for everyone but if you\u2019re truly just looking around, there\u2019s lots of free resources online. In case you like it too, I can always share more!",

I prefer having a stable income and job security. I am in graduate school for electrical engineering. I wish I wouldve done this from the start. Immense job opportunities and projected job growth over the next 10+ years. Also, you can't complain about easily making 6 figures and the ability to work from home. Good luck making your decision!",

I was an art kid who liked to draw and became very interested in printmaking while at BSU. I now get paid to make boring publications (instruction manuals) visually interesting. Not exactly what I planned, but I really do love it and it certainly utilizes many of the skills I learned while at BSU.",

I\u2019m coming as a grad student in psychology at BSU.  I completed my undergrad in psych from Purdue, and believe it or not, I started out as a Physics major. I loved science and research, but I hated math and numbers. A year in and I hated every minute of my major until I was exposed to mental health issues personally and took an intro psych class! I have now completed my undergrad with tons of research experience and love my life like never before. \n\nSo don\u2019t choose something that will make you look cool, choose something that you love with a passion, pick a dream career path that you know you\u2019ll be good at and choose to study that in college!",

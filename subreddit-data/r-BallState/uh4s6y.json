    "postText": "BSU rentals is literally the worst company I think I've ever been in contact with. I rented with them last year and they are just the worst. Half our outlets broke halfway through the year and they literally took 3 months to fix it. They took way way to long to turn on the heat the inside of the apartment was literally 50 degrees, at one point I was wearing gloves just to type on my computer. They said they would provide window AC units for everyone, but they showed up one day to look at it, and never came back, never responded about it again, and the maintenance request says it was completed. This left us to live with 0 AC in the middle of August. On top of all this shit they put us through, they lost our fucking sheet we had to fill out in the beginning of the year that listed everything wrong with the apartment, and trust me it was a very long sheet. This sheet took us a few hours to fill out, half of everything was broken or ripped, walls were in terrible shape, carpet was stained to all hell, truly a wreck but we needed a place to stay and they are cheap. Them losing this sheet is now making us pay over 1200 dollars in fees for the exact shit we said was broken in the beginning of the year. Unless we can prove we turned it in they said they would \"take further actions if necessary\". Obviously we can't fucking prove it because they don't send us any confirmation emails or anything about, they said they would fucking keep it and this has never been a problem before.\n\nOk that's my rant, don't ever rent from this company. Location and price may be good, but it's so not worth it. Most scum company on this earth exploiting college kids.",

They didn\u2019t insult it so my room was always either extremely cold or so damn hot. I also accidentally overpaid my July rent 3x what I owed and they refused to give it back. Had to go through the bank and tell them that it was a mistake.",

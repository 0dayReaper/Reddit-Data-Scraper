    "postText": "I want to teach theatre/English. My problem is that I don\u2019t see a way I can do that without double majoring. A friend said I can get certified for English education as a bonus through the theatre education program, but I can\u2019t find anything like that on the website. I\u2019d rather do English primarily, so I want to make sure that if I do the theatre program I can still get the English certification.\n\nIf it\u2019s possible to get the theatre certification as a bonus through the English program instead, that would be even better.",

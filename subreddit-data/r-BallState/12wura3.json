Early registration for classes comes in clutch so many times. I\u2019d say try it out, but if it\u2019s not for you, there\u2019s no shame in dropping it.",

Someone I now work with that I graduated the same year as did take that path (we were in the same major in the ISOM program, so other than honors we had the same experience). He said that he traveled to Europe on some extra curricular with the college, and did a bunch of additional research projects. In the end I make a lot more money than him at our job and have a more prestigious position for what it's worth. I'd say do it if you care for the academic experience, but don't expect it to change anything post university unless you want to get into a more difficult to enter company right off the bat and need something to differentiate yourself. At this point in our career, no company would care about that compared to our past decade of actual work experience",

Also, they can have really great scholarships.\n\nIf you find it's not for you, you can drop, not difficult. But you need to be an honors student coming in to be one at all, so it's worth a shot.",

            "comment": "I'll echo what others have said here. I think it's worth it for the early registration and dorm alone (though living in DeHo as a freshman is probably not as big of a perk anymore compared to when LaFollette was still a thing). I didn't love all of the classes, but others were super enjoyable. I thought you were given quite a bit of flexibility to still take courses that interested you within the Honors curriculum; there are several sections of the same course in most cases, which allowed you to find the one that both fulfilled the requirement and actually held your attention. I also found the Honors advisors to be a step above the general freshman advisors (and definitely a step above the one in my department at the time, though you rely more on your departmental advisor as you get further into your major). The Honors College can help you find a sense of community early on, and all of the faculty are super helpful and want to see you succeed. Like others have said, there are a lot of good scholarship opportunities available to Honors students as well. I was in the program from 2015-18 so I'm sure things have changed some, but feel free to message me if you have questions!",

Different majors have different credit requirements and as a music ed major myself it wasn't really worth all the extra effort when we have so much extra going on already. It entirely depends on your work habits, time management, major, and what extracurriculars you'll want to take part in.",

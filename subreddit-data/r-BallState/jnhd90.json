    "postText": "Hello! I have not seen anyone else do this, but especially since we can't socialize in person as easily this year, I wanted to organize a **Discord server** for students to connect with one another a little bit more easily by providing an easily accessible platform to connect with one another, whether they're looking for a study buddy, a gaming partner, or just a friend to hang out with. I have a good deal of experience with Discord so I am happy to help answer questions or concerns. **You can join through the link below.** Thanks in advance.  \nhttps://discord.gg/7kYp8jAT7H",

I will look further into it and keep you posted on any answers I get.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm looking for a club or group on campus that's about educating students and taking political action from a leftist perspective. I remember seeing something my freshman year about a group that did something like that, but after 2016 I haven't really seen or heard anything about them. If they're still around id love to come to a meeting.",

Which I think is fair.  \n\nI don't live on campus but I think they should let students leave without charge.  There's probably already someone who's sick and doesn't know or if no one is, it's just better to let everyone leave if they want because dorms are closed spaces so it'd be a hotbed for things to spread.  Either way, letting students leave would be better to prevent a quarantine as someone's already mentioned.  Hope on campus students can leave without issue after Monday cause I wouldn't blame them for wanting to go home.",

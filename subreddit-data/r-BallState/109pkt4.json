I submitted help desk tickets and they basically told me since some devices naturally put out their own wifi signal and cause interference, they block them to keep the regular signal strong for everyone. Not sure how true that is but I'm sure they still won't let you set certain devices up fully. You'll have to wait until you're off campus unfortunately!",

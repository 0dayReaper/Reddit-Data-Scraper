    "postText": "An email was sent out yesterday regarding refunds when it comes to those who lived in the dorms. By the sounds of it if you are taking summer classes that refund will be used to cover your tuition. If you are not taking summer classes that lump sum will be given to you via direct deposit in August. If you do it the paper check way you will receive your lump sum of the refund in September.",

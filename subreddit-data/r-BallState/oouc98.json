    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an incoming grad student, and I saw an email about purchasing single/game tickets. I just had a few questions about football game tickets (these may be dumb questions, but the college I went for undergrad didn\u2019t have a football team). First, is there an option to purchase seasonal tickets? Also, is it worth it to purchase tickets in advance or should I just purchase them on the day of/at the game? Are BSU\u2019s football\ngames popular/crowded? Thanks in advance! :)",

Here's an article I found on how to claim your free tickets: [https://ballstatesports.com/sports/2019/5/30/ball-state-students-ticketing-fan-experience-information.aspx](https://ballstatesports.com/sports/2019/5/30/ball-state-students-ticketing-fan-experience-information.aspx)\n\nAs a semi-recent BSU Cheer alum: games are usually not crowded. The most crowded games are Family Weekend and Homecoming. Because BSU was good this past year, crowds might be bigger than usual, but I doubt the stadium will ever be packed. However, the tailgate fields will be, lol! Don't let a low crowd keep you from going and having fun. Some of my favorite college memories are at BSU sporting events, even if I wasn't really paying attention to the game. (PS: I recommend watching a gymnastics meet at some point--they are awesome!)",

I was using my undergrad and then grad ID until I was damn near 30 (I look young for my age). Games aren\u2019t too crowded usually, maybe this season will be better coming off a MAC Championship and bowl win. Homecoming is always a bigger crowd, and any bigger program coming in (IU for example) would have more fans. But historically it has been hard to get students to games\u2026.",

    "postText": "College is hard enough in person, and online classes are even more difficult for a lot of people. If you are unhappy with the state of education going into this semester in light of the covid-19 crisis, I highly recommend contacting the university and looking into deferring your enrollment until the spring, or possibly next fall.\n\nOn top of that, and maybe I'm just a homer with rose tinted glasses, but college is a special time, and Ball State is an incredibly special place. And, if I could take my moderator cap off for a second, I believe you would be doing yourself a disservice by not attempting to get the absolute most out of it. \n\nI don't know the nuances of those who are getting aid/scholarships to attend and how deferring may affect that, but the school has resources for you to contact to sort that out.\n\nIf you are currently enrolled, I don't know what the process looks like for taking a gap year or semester, but again if you are thinking about it, don't be afraid to talk to the university.",

If you want to defer, you better do it soon.\n\nBall State (or any university) isn't going to allow everyone to defer. Especially because they need space for next year.\n\nMore importanlty, if you go to communuty college in your gap year,  **Ball State will consider you a Transfer Student and might remove your deferment.** In Ball State's eyes, you chose another school, despite being a community college.\n\nCareful with your scholarships/funding as well.",

    "postText": "I recently acquired a Nintendo Switch and have decided to bring it on campus. However, I was wanting to enable the WiFi on it, but none of the different connections work. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an error on my end or the campus WiFi just doesn\u2019t cooperate with the Nintendo Switch. Either way, does anyone know what it is?",

You\u2019ll need to put in a ticket to Housing and Residence Life and have a technician come out and put it on a separate, hidden, WiFi connection. Just tell them you need a console hooked up to the WiFi. Weird though because I remember as I was graduating they were working on a self service portal to do but guess that hasn\u2019t happened yet",

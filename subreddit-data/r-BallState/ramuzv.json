I don\u2019t think they need N95s and boosters as much as they need to stop touching each other\u2019s faces and hugging strangers and generally acting a fool.   \n\nI watched from inside the restaurant I work as hordes of the drunken zombies walked by kissing and hugging random people walking by in celebration after a football game. Nobody wearing masks, everyone sweating noses running all over each other. If we can\u2019t get them to wear normal masks and stop fingering each other\u2019s faces, they\u2019re not going to wear an N-95. \n\nJust acting responsible is more effective than any other measure. You can go out and enjoy the game without constantly touching your face and other people.",

(I agree that many people don't care much at all about those things, though, sadly.) I used to be ignorant about this because I kept hearing the advice to wash and sanitize hands/disinfect tables and door knobs/etc., but N95 masks and vaxx's are BY FAR the two best measures.\n\nCOVID is airborne--the main route of transmission is from the aerosols/mists we exhale when we breathe and talk normally. There are fewer than 100 documented cases of (fomite) transfer by touching, but several thousands of documented cases of airborne transmission. It's why super spreader events are almost always indoors (even though people touch their faces outdoors as much as indoors.) Wearing only a cotton/poly mask indoors is way, way more dangerous than touching your own face.\n\nStrongly recommend N95s! : )\n\nEdit: Here's a recent study backing up my claims about N95s.

I mean, in all of my classes--including bigger lectures--no one else is wearing N95s. I'm not the only \"responsible\" person. I know a few people personally, including professors, who care, but none of them wear N95s, not even the professor who says she's so worried about bringing covid home and infecting her child. (Or at least they didn't until I gave some to one person.) So I really do wonder sometimes if I'm the only person in the classroom who's heard that the cotton/poly masks and the surgical masks that everyone wears only protect you \\~20%, while a fitted mask like mine protects \\~90%. \n\nPlus no stores around here sell my masks--I order online from 3M. So that's why I thought I'd mention it. \n\nBut maybe you're right and no one wants or needs to hear it lol. Who knows at this point. But my hope is that by a year from now, N95s/KN94s will replace cotton/poly masks as the standard. Cheers.",

For all of 2021 (and the end of 2020) there have been ample supplies of N95s in the US. In fact, since the summer they have commonly been on sale, both on Amazon and directly from manufacturers like 3M.\n\nThis is why I mentioned it in my post. I agree that there's been conflicting advice, due to fears at the beginning of the pandemic of a shortage. The shortage was overcome, though, thanks to massive production both in the US (where N95s are made) and also elsewhere, like South Korea (where equally good KN95s are made). The CDC was also worried that people would find N95s uncomfortable, and so give up on all masks. Unlike cotton/poly masks, N95s that don't fit can pinch--so some people have to try a couple before they find a comfy one. \n\nIt matters because folks who wear cotton/poly masks nonetheless very often get covid. Those masks offer some, but only very modest, protections. N95 protection is more than 4X better, according to numerous studies. The difference is nearly as much as getting vaxx'ed. (Don't believe me. Look at the plethora of studies on the subject, the most recent of which I linked to above.) \n\nThe way I see it, if I'm going to wear a mask I might as well wear a good one. A box of 20 disposable N95s cost about $20, and you can wear each one more than 10 times (but wait a few days to a week between reuse, to let whatever viruses are on the filter die off). But I agree that any mask is better than no mask, and most people want no mask.  : (",

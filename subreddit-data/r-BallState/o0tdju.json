Her lease starts in august and if anyone is interested or knows of someone, please reach out! It\u2019s a 3 bedroom first floor apartment. Me and the the other roommate are both females, and we both have cats. The rent is reasonable, I believe $280 a month, everything included except electric and wifi.",

Citing sources by even just giving a link just helps provide everyone with context that may not be in that screenshot and other information easy if they want to learn more and do not have access to those emails (like a parents or alum).",

What about work/friends/family/ and so much more out of their control? Tests should be mandatory if that\u2019s the route they want but classes should be online",

(see Facebook Event Link below)   \n\n\nTHE COMMUNITY AT LARGE HAS FORMAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE CITY COUNCIL:  \n\n\n*  At the August 21st meeting: Commit to overturning the July ordinance, thereby negating the financial package regardless of cost or penalty to the City.  \n\n* At the September Council meeting: Introduce the ordinance to overturn the financial package, motion to suspend the rules, and call a vote on the new ordinance at the same meeting.   \n\n* Moving forward: Commit to and develop a plan of transparency and full communication with the citizens of Muncie.   \n   \n\n\nWe are organizing against a project we were never told about. That is being forced on our town, largely by a crooked redevelopment commission and city council.  \n\n\nTHIS FACTORY WOULD BLOW LARGE AMOUNTS OF LEAD AND MERCURY DIRECTLY TOWARDS CAMPUS  \n\n\nAs well as:  \n\n\n* 417,932 tons of Carbon Dioxide per year\n* .97 tons per year of methane\n* .1 tons of nitrous oxide.  \n\n\nThe raw material itself is an EPA Hazardous Waste.  \n\n\nYou don't want this in a town you're going to spend this much time in do you?  \n\n\nCome out, if you can, bring friends! And let the council know that you have a voice and you matter as a part of Muncie, and if they don't think you matter, you may just go elsewhere.  \n\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/events/406520866651094/](https://www.facebook.com/events/406520866651094/)  \n\n\nCAN'T COME TO THE MEETING YOU SAY??  \n\n\nNot a problem at all!

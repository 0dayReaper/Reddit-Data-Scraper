I'm curious where's the best place to get tested. \n\nI hope she at least bought a lateral flow test (the 15 minute tests that cost about $15 from Target).",

The state decided there needed to be a school for students who wanted minimal covid restrictions and guidelines--and BSU drew the short straw, sadly for us.\n\nShame on BSU. \n\nYou should post about this on the other thread about pros and cons of attending BSU. Some people don't care about covid--and BSU is for them! If you're an entering freshman who wants a school that offers decent covid safety policies--like a free test if you're exposed to covid--go somewhere else!",

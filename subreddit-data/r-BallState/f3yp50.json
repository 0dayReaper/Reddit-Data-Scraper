It\u2019s student run by music education majors, all string players. \nYou could also enroll in lessons with Professor Jakovcic. I\u2019m not sure what his availability is, and you would probably have to wait until next semester to enroll in the course for private lessons. \n\nIf you want more info I can send you a pm.",

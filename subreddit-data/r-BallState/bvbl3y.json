    "postText": "If you're a fan of HBO's Chernobyl and are interested in the subject or Soviet history in general then I suggest you go speak with Dr. Sergei Zhuk over in the history department. He was a member of what was basically the Ukrainian National Guard when Chernobyl happened and was called up as part of the recovery work.",

I'm not sure I'd necessarily recommend a class with him, since it's clear he cares far more about the research side of academia than the teaching side, but he's certainly an interesting character. \n\nOh, and also, he kinda has a feud with Dr. Dmitiriev in the history department, since Dmitriev grew up in Soviet Russia",

Every class he would share personal stories of growing up and living in the Soviet Union. Per being a DJ, he had his record collection confiscated by the KGB at least twice if I remember correctly.",

You know...dark clothes, maybe a hoodie covering my face, lots of weapons and looking very threatening.    It's kind of a theme.  I will look really terrifyingly dangerous and scary (cause...Halloween), but in reality I am a kush smoking pacifist.  Maybe I will just kick the door in and start firing off blanks.  That would really scare some people.  Then I will yell, \"Just kidding, who wants to blaze?\"  Again, just for clarification, you said 200 N McKinley?  This is gonna be so dope.  ",

As for costume parties it's anyone's guess but you can usually just walk around in costume and find your way in. You're already in costume, ya know? That one on McKinley had a great themed costume party last year but it was specifically cops and robbers. Easy to get into but kind of cool to get \"lost\" in the crowd. Great for couples costumes too!",

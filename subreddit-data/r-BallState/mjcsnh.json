    "postText": "So, I got accepted into the Ball State Honors College for my freshman year. And I also got accepted into Purdue. I have been weighing the options, but I am not sure which school would be better to go into (Purdue vs. BSU HC)? I am considering going into computer science (which BSU accepted me for while Purdue accepted me for exploratory studies), but my heart definitely isn't 100% set on it. I was just wondering, thanks :)",

            "comment": "I didn\u2019t do the honors college when I was student, but I supervise student employees now and it\u2019s kind of 50/50 on if the students in the honors college feel like it\u2019s even worth it. Quite a few that I\u2019ve talked to said that they felt like it was a waste of time/effort because it just seem to be adding more to their workload with little payout as they applied for jobs or internships. I think it depends on how you want your classes to be structured. \n\nDo you have scholarships to either school? If so, i personally would have what my out-of-pocket cost would be weigh into my decision. As someone with a degree and who has worked in various industries, employers rarely care about where you went to school. But you\u2019ll likely care once you\u2019re done with school if you have a bunch of student debt. Just a thought. \n\nLike another commenter mentioned, there are a million variables in this decision. Ball state is a good school, but so is Purdue. You likely can\u2019t go wrong. Good luck!",

There isn't a truly \"wrong\" decision for you here. You obviously have both the drive and the ability to do whatever you desire to do. As long as you work hard at each individual step you take things will be fine.\n\nDon't get me wrong it is a big decision-\n\nBut it will be okay either way alright? You've got this :)",

            "comment": "I graduated from Ball State with a CS degree. It was in my opinion an easy program, I\u2019ve talked with colleagues at work and they had much harder coursework in comparison. That being said you get what you put in and I had to put in a lot of extra time to get my first job offer.\n\nPurdue from what I know is a much higher tier CS school. You actually have to pay a premium for CS at Purdue. However the name recognition for Purdue is much higher. (Not that it matters too much nowadays)\n\nPersonally I would lean towards the most economical choice. There are so many reasons to pick a school, creating a pros vs cons list may be a good place to start.\n\nAlso if you have questions about CS I recommend r/cscareerquestions as a good starting point.\n\nEdit: I took a look at your post on the Purdue sub and I think it\u2019s important to reiterate that school name in tech doesn\u2019t matter nearly as much as it used to. Yes Purdue is academically a better school but not as much as they are emphasizing in that sub. It\u2019s still Purdue it\u2019s not Stanford. Employers just care if you can do the job not where you went to school. I work in big tech and have interviewed at most of the big guys and my time at Ball State helped me get there.",

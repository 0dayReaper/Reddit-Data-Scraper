    "postText": "I recently took ACC 301. I felt like I struggled through it, but ended up getting a B+ so not too bad. But this semester I\u2019m taking ACC 302 with Professor Dennis Hickle. I\u2019m so nervous because I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t pass. Also, I checked out Rate My Professor and many people there say the class is very difficult. How bad will ACC 302 be? Any tips?",

[I looked it up](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/transmitting-std-indiana.htm), and it appears that knowingly transmitting herpes is not a crime in Indiana. \n\nHowever, this does not mean that you can't do anything. You should absolutely go to the [dean's office](https://www.bsu.edu/about/administrativeoffices/dean-of-students), and they will point you in the right direction. \n\nPlease keep us updated OP, I'm sorry if you did contract something, and have a lot of respect for you trying to do something about it. Feel free to PM me if you need support or help navigating any of the student affairs stuff.",

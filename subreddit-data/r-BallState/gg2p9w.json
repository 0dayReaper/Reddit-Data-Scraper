    "postText": "HeyO, former BSU student checking in. When I was going to BSU, I was doing the required research class that you all have to take, and as a recovering addict, I figured I'd write a research paper about the war on drugs. I argued that drugs should be legalized and regulated by the Federal government, and that tax dollars made this way should be used to fund this completely (similar to how cannabis legalization has reduced cannabis use in states where it's been legalized, and how it earns millions of dollars of income for the state governments annually). I argued and provided evidence and interviews about this topic, that doing this would reduce overdose rates. Never in the paper did I advocate breaking laws, simply a restructuring of them to reduce the harm on our society, with the goal of reducing overdoses and the rate of incarceration of Americans. \n\nHowever, my professor clearly had a problem with the subject matter, and made me edit several sentences that made her uncomfortable, yet did not advocate anything illegal or violate school policy. Chief among these was the assertion that even though the distribution of drugs is illegal, it is not morally wrong, and therefore, should not be illegal. I argued that government should accept this, and regulate the industry, rather than pushing it to the streets and increasing crime. My professor made me edit this out, and threatened to have me expelled if I did not. However, it is not illegal to say X is not morally wrong. I carefully worded this to avoid advocating committing crimes, and calmly explained this to her, but she didn't care, because she believed it was problematic. I believe that forcing students to change their papers under threat of expulsion because they contain subject matter that clearly makes the professor uncomfortable places severe limits on research and academia, as well as social activism, and should be called out whenever it happens. I no longer go to BSU, I just remembered this story and thought somebody should know about it. Cheers!",

My professor was EXTREMELY liberal and didn\u2019t like some of my stances so I was graded unfairly. I brought it up with the department and had it resolved. I mean too late now, but that sounds a bit ridiculous. We had someone write a paper similar to this in our philosophy class and he wasn\u2019t treated this way.",

Easily half the people in academia use something illegal occasionally, and LOTS of people care about minority arrests and the criminal justice system, inside and outside academia. While I did priotitize factual arguments, my assertion isn't incorrect. Drugs didn't even start to be criminalized until about a century ago, and were legal through societies across the world for centuries. It's definately a legal issue and not a moral one. Also, most people who use drugs aren't \"crackheads\" or whatever. Most of it is marijuana/normal cocaine/abused perscriptions/psychedelics. Not saying crackheads aren't out there, but a LOT of people use and that stigma should be addressed as well. I argued that if drugs were regulated by the gov instead of criminalized, we could reduce addiction by putting strong regs on the amounts people could buy, but make it accessible enough to get people off the streets and reduce crime.",

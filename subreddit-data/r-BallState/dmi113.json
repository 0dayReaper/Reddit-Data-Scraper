For those who do not know what I'm talking about, the goal of the class is to reach at least 1000 likes on a Facebook page. My group, Cardinal Construction, is pretty close to our goal but we want to reach as many as people as possible. With that being said, if anyone would be interested in liking the page the link is below! thank you to anyone who likes our page! \n\n[https://www.facebook.com/BSUconstruction/](https://www.facebook.com/BSUconstruction/)",

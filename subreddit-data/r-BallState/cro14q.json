    "postText": "Welcome to Muncie!   \n\n\nNow, you may have heard this referred to as a \"Steel Dust Recycling Plant\"  which is a huge misnomer, first and foremost. That's corporate propaganda.  \n\n\nPossibly coming to you, at the old Borg Warner site, is \"Electric Arc Furnace Dust\" which is an EPA Hazardous Material (EPA Code K061), and the plant would be in receipt of 1,000 tons per day of that raw material.  \n\n\nNow, that's just what the plant RECEIVES. Which is a hazardous material, that doesn't even get into the emissions of that plant. Waelz \"Sustainable\" Products on their own factory emissions for a similar plant:  \n\n\n* 417,932 tons of Carbon Dioxide per year\n* .97 tons per year of methane\n* .1 tons of nitrous oxide.  \n\n\nThat methane number, though it seems low is discerning, not to mention the horrendous CO2 emissions.  \n\n\nHeritage Thermal Services (who has partnered with Waelz on this project) poisoned East Liverpool, OH into a state that it has never recovered from:  \n\n\n\" \n\nEast Liverpool's streetscapes offer the direst, most depraved and destitute sights any Appalachian river town has to offer. Businesses have closed because of a flight of people leaving town. There is a myriad of empty storefronts and downtown retail buildings have been razed. Even some of the saloons and taverns have been boarded up with \\`CLOSED' signs propped up in their dusty cobwebbed little windows that once held a neon sign with \\`OPEN' blinking on and off.\n\nEast Liverpool is a small city that is fast becoming a village. In another few decades, it might become a virtual ghost town. In 1990, its population was just under 14,000 and these days, city residents are estimated to number a little over 10,000. That's quite a drain on what makes up a city - its people.\n\nFirst proposed in 1979 and touted as a great provider of jobs and prosperity, in the 1990's, when the incinerator was being built, East Liverpool became the center of national controversy. Originally operating under the business name Waste Technologies Industries (WTI), these days, the company operates under the name Heritage Thermal Services.  \n\n\n\\[...\\]  \n\n\n Meanwhile, in Ohio's southern Columbiana County, Heritage Thermal Services' smokestack, burning ovens, offices, and storage yards sit on a flood plain, on top of a high-yielding aquifer, and this plant was built on heavily polluted grounds. A little more than 100 yards away, there are residential homes and Heritage Thermal, then WTI, was constructed on a hill a mere 1,100 feet away from a 400-pupil elementary school, which stayed in operation up to just three years ago. This school's elementary teachers were instructed to put wet blankets and towels over the school's windows in case there was an emergency situation at the incinerator. They were told to close windows and doors of their classrooms. Teachers were told to dampen the towels and blankets using buckets of water to cover \\`Shelter in Place' legal requirements for emergency situations. But there was no plan to control things in the event of an explosion, which would blow out the school's windows, said Mike Walton, a 75-year-old, lifelong East Liverpool resident who has fought the hazardous waste incinerator since it was being planned, and who serves as a trustee and board member of a local opposition group, Save Our County.   \n\n\n\\[...\\]  \n\n\n \n\nWhat toxins have Von Roll's WTI, and later, its Heritage Thermal Services, been pouring into the skies in East Liverpool? Well, it's known that lead, various dioxins, cadmium, arsenic, and manganese are on the list, but many other types of hazardous pollutants are included, too.\n\n\"They really don't know what all they're burning. It's a big mystery,\" Spencer said solemnly and with a bit of anger.\n\n\"They're allowed to emit four tons of lead a year into the air,\" Walton said. \"The EPA is okay with that. Up until about three years ago, 600 children grades Kindergarten through sixth were attending school only 1,100 feet from its smokestack. How can this not be a problem?\"\n\nAccording to Walton and Spencer, Herb Needleman, a University of Pittsburgh professor who is a leading world expert of the harms lead causes to humans, and was even instrumental in ridding lead in gasoline, said he couldn't believe that the government would allow for such a facility to be built.\n\n\"Needleman said the children in this area would be like canaries in a mine shaft,\" Walton said. \"I talked to an engineer who was working on the construction phase of WTI. He told me that he wouldn't live within 100 miles of East Liverpool, because of the chemicals that would be burned at WTI,\" Walton said in disgust. *The aerial photo below shows the placement of this hazardous waste incinerator. It is located very close to the Ohio River, a major feeding source for the Mississippi River Watershed; and it is planted on a flood plain and within a residential area. A few major highways are very close to this industry, too. Surreptitiously touted, and using erroneous and misleading public relations tactics, Von Roll's big push in the 1990's was that the stack and the incineration plant would be anchored in a relatively remote locale.\"*  \n\n\n  \nThe city council signed onto give WSP/Heritage Co. a tax abatement (basically giving them the land for free!)  \n\n\nTwo weeks ago over 1,100 people gathered at City Hall in opposition to the project that was never clearly announced to the populace, nor were was public input taken in any sort of responsible fashion.  \n\n\nCouncil Chair Doug Marshall walked out of the meeting, cutting off a citizen who was speaking. Marshall was met with relentless booing and being called a \"Fucking coward\" by many, to his face.  \n\n\nThe council then moved to hold a special meeting with environmental scientists as well as people from WSP/Heritage.  \n\n\nThat meeting is Wednesday, August 21st at Cornerstone Center for the Arts, and we would love to see BSU students show up in mass against this.    \n\n\nBall State would be downwind of this project. It would literally dump toxins directly over the campus and downtown areas for decades to come if it is built, despite the assurances of the county and the company officials.  \n\n\nWhat else can you do?  \n\n\nPlease join our involvement group on Facebook. We have daily organized actions we've been taking to apply constant pressure to the parties who are actually able to stop this project, and to take the actions necessary to ensure this does not come to our town.  \n\n\nJoin us!   \n\n\n [https://www.facebook.com/groups/2299570330284259/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2299570330284259/)",

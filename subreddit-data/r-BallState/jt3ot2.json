    "postText": "Hey! So I am trying to live off campus next year but I am wondering how this stuff works. I am looking at staying in University Village, but when I started the application process it says that I have to have a monthly income of more than 3 times the rent. I do not have a job because I go to school full time and my parents do not help with paying for anything. I also don\u2019t qualify for any grants, just the unsubsidized loans. This year my parents took out the parents plus loan to pay for the rest of my tuition (that I\u2019ll be paying them back) but I\u2019m not sure about next year. Can I take out a personal/student loan through places like Sallie Mae to pay my rent each month? \n\nSorry if these is a stupid question I\u2019m just not sure how this stuff works. TIA!",

You'll absolutely include your yearly rent into that loan.\n\nFYI, you'll probably need a cosigner for the apartment at UV. \n\nMake sure you're choosing your roommates. They're not the greatest at pairing roommates together.",

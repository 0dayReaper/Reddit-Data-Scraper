    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m a ball state student with a major in social work. I recently conducted a survey for one of my social work classes. The survey is about abusive parenting styles and how it effects adolescents. I could really use your feedback. It\u2019s a fairly short survey and should only take about 10 minutes or less to complete. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you take my survey.",

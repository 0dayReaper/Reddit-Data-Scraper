There\u2019s also a free little library in the corner that the English Ed students I knew when I was there established. \n\nI also like the lobby of the communications building first floor but it tends to be busy. I used to love studying in lafollette but I think they just tore it down? \n\nI\u2019m not on campus anymore so idk if dining halls are open for seating but woodworth has some tables to the side (not in the big area with the fans) that get quiet after peak food hours \n\nThere are not tables and you do have to put your backpack up but if you go to the museum you can carry around a book or notepad. I used to enjoy reading on the benches in there\u2014no one minds.\n\nDepending on what dorm you\u2019re in (if you live on campus) there might be cool study lounges in your dorm. Make friends with someone in DeHo\u2014best study lounges on campus. Park also has really nice lounges. \n\nAnd of course there\u2019s plenty of places outside!",

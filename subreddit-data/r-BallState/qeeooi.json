There was multiple instances of pledges being hazed and multiple OSL violations that culminated in the organization being temporarily removed from campus. They are currently recolonizing and have a group of admirable young men with their priorities in line. \n\nThat being said, to address the elephant in the room. I was an active brother during an instance where a young lady was sexually assaulted by another active. I, along many others, took immediate actions to have that person removed from the school and the fraternity, and we tried our hardest to make sure they were punished to the fullest extent of the law. \n\nThat person is no longer part of the fraternity or Ball State for that matter.",

That happened years before and I personally spent countless hours working with the police and school to make sure it didn't happen again while I was actively part of the school and chapter. I was just trying to be honest about the issues that occured and caused the the removal from campus. \n\nLike I said, the issue was hazing at the end of the day. I believe there was even an article about it. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/1513482002\n\nThis article discusses an issue with a kid suing the fraternity and school due to injury caused to him. This was the cause I believe. If I remember correctly some kids were playing some stupid slapping game and the one kid ended up getting seriously hurt.",

This is to say contact those students directly, not the Digital Corps itself.",

(Source: former employee) You won't get a good video for free, though. Be prepared to ask what their rates are before you get started. Good news is that most freelancing students will give a pretty good rate to fellow students as long as you treat them well.\n\nThey're located in BC210, and the front desk is open during normal business hours. Write up a freelance request with a brief description of what you want to have made, other pertinent information about the project and include your contact info. Ask if it can be shared with the Video Team, and see if anyone picks it up. Corps students, in my 100% biased opinion, are among the most talented folks on campus and I know they can make something awesome for you. Good luck with your Kickstarter!",

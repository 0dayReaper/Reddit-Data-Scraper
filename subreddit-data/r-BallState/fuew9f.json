            "comment": "Honestly, if you can get into University apartments you'd be in good shape. Cheaper than living anywhere else. They don't have every amenity known to man but you have Ball State as your landlord, they're very responsive to issues. You have all utilities included in your rent (tv, internet, electric). Lived in them 4 years and it was terrific. \n\nEdit: Stayed in Anthony (north side of campus) for 4 years, loved it. Anthony is on campus but a ways from the dorms. It is totally walk-able and right next to a bus stop, but I'd recommend a bike as it is probably the best way to get around campus.\n\n The other complex is Scheidler, which is mostly townhouses. The real drawback is they aren't on campus and if you missed the last bus back it is a fair walk across a couple busy roads. Most people get along fine w/ just the bus, but French grad student used a scooter (and it worked out great for him).",

I eventually moved out early yet they kept illegally charged me for electric and stuff. Then when I continued to call they switched management 3x. They tried to charge me more for missing keys yet they actually had them all along and lost them. Then when they did find that and the paperwork they swore I had put the fake papers in their locked office. Also they charged me and my other roommates that were there (even though we had photo proof and signed copies proving otherwise) for damage the other roommate did while she lived there before us.\n\nEdits: grammar",

Places like University Village Muncie and the Village Promenade have nice amenities but boy, they can be pricey. Good luck!",

The manager was reasonable and nice, and I always had quick responses from maintenance when needed. Very close to campus. Downsides are that they're kind of old (not gross or anything, just older) so you have to keep a close eye out for any maintenance issues, but I had very few while I was there. Other downside is that it's around the corner from the fraternity houses, so if you're a light sleeper, you probably would want a unit towards the back of the complex to avoid the loud freshmen sounds on weekends. It's been a few years so things could be different now, and have no idea what they charge for a room there now, but I liked it.",

    "postText": "Do any commuters know if I can park in the regular green lots past 5 pm Mon-Fri? The lot signs all day 7am-5pm, so I'm worried about getting back to my car and leaving past 5 pm because I don't really want a citation. Somebody on the phone said that was for visitors, but even when purchasing the pass it specifies Mon-Fri 7am-5pm.",

I forgot the time the lot enforcement began, but I was mostly worried about the time it ended since I have a class that ends at like 4:45 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays and meetings on Wednesdays until 5 pm and I was scared about getting a ticket. I just don't wanna feel left out as a commuter student, I live nearby so I didn't wanna pay extra for residence on campus, but all the activities look so fun in the evenings and I wanted to make sure I could join in without worry!",

I went to look around once and there wasn\u2019t much for what I\u2019m looking for (zoology degree) but for my friend there was a lot of options for internships and jobs after graduation (law enforcement). I would look at what employers are going to be there ahead of time and see if any of them are your field.",

Other than that you'll find some random finance/business-type companies, some construction companies, insurance and a few other random things sprinkled in. Very few companies I've ever heard of. I didn't get any good leads there. However it was really good networking practice and the free headshot was really nice too. \n\nI would go to the companies looking for salesmen, get talking and then ask for contact info for the department I was actually interested in. They almost always gave it to me.",

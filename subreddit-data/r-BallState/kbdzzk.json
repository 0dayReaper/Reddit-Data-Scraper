We are seeing if anyone is interested in housing for the spring semester. This could extend to the next academic year if that is wanted. We are two males and rent is $275. Feel free to pm me for more info. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/orehjmo66n461.jpg?width=3092&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=140294439c517a62cc6c6e78027f90159b9fffe7",

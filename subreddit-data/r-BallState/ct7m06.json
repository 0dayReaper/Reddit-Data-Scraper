If he doesn't have an priors it shouldn't be anything more than him having to do some BS safe drinking activitie, and pay a small fine.",

No need to go get a lawyer that he has to pay for, his tuition already pays for one.\n\nIn my experience, especially if the kid has no prior violations of any kind, he'll get stuck with some volunteer work and a fine for the ticket. I don't think he's at a huge risk of losing a scholarship. \n\nSource: a student at Ball State for too long now",

            "comment": "I would recommend looking into University housing, specifically the apartments. Been a good while since I've lived in one, but they used to be 1) very affordable, 2) good maintenance response, 3) include _all_ utilities. Anthony is on campus and right next to a bus stop. It is about a 15-20 minute walk to Robert Bell but if you have a bike it is less than 1/2 that. \n\nScheidler is the other set of University apartments. These are built like townhomes and were originally meant for married couples. The drawback for Scheidler is that it isn't on campus. The shuttle/bus does have a variety of stops there, but if you get yourself in a pinch or have to be on campus after buses stop running you'll have to walk.",

            "comment": "How much of a concern is money? Off campus imo is the best bet. Muncie has a lot of properties converted to apartments. Single bedroom apartments are hard to find, most ads will actually be for sharing a bathroom and kitchen. There are some newer places that obviously aren't like this. If you don't mind roommates you can find stuff as low as 300/each within a mile or 2 of campus. If you like walking you should be okay but might pay a bit more. But driving to class is easy to do at ball state as there are big commuter lots, some city streets which aren't patrolled much (Bsu PD however is very vigilant). Also there's the shuttle which helps get around if you do park on the edges.\n\nEdit: I'm still looking for a 1 bedroom place that was reasonable price and has a garage. Lmk if anyone knows of something like this thx",

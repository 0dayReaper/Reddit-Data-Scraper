It\u2019s all dependent on what organization you join, and what the people in charge of said organizations come up with.",

I still have really close friends who I met through Greek life, men and women, even my now wife! I\u2019d recommend going through recruitment, you can always drop out of recruitment or decline bids. Sororities were way more strict in enforcement on hazing. There is a rule where Active members of the organization were not allowed to drink with New Members (women who have pledged, but are not initiated to the organization). I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s not enforced very well. It\u2019s kind of a judgement call on which organization you go to. Feel free to PM if you have any more questions, even though I\u2019m male my wife was a part of a sorority for a period, and I have close friends who were a part of sororities at Ball State! Best of luck at the school!",

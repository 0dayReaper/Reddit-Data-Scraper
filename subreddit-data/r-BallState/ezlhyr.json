            "comment": "Just picked my room for 3rd year in Park. Definitely the best on campus. Decent sized rooms, drywall (not cement bricks), semi private bathroom (sharing with about 7 other people), great location for all of campus being pretty central, A/C, quiet building. Definitely won't meet as many people like living in freshman forms though so will have to find friends other ways (100% recommend getting a group of friends you liking hanging out with, makes life a lot better). In my opinion, if you can afford the price then Park is definitely worth it.",

People I know who are more extrovert and had doors open and talked to people in the hall loved it.\nDepends if you're a hide and keep to yourself or friends with the world type.",

If you're able to get a parking permit (not sure if they allow those for Freshmen these days?), you'll be able to park pretty close to your dorm and be a quick drive from Downtown Muncie that has some decent restaurants. Enjoy your stay!",

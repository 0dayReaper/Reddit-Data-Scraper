There are lots of good ideas here! \n\nI would like to add that there is a mini golfing place and ice cream shop called Boulder Falls on McGalliard. I'm not a golfer, but I've had a lot of fun there with groups of friends. Tuhey Pool is a public pool pretty close to campus. For ages 18+ it is $5 entry to the pool and they have a concession stand. \n\nAdditionally, lots of restaurants/bars have game nights. Roots has music bingo on Tuesdays and trivia on Wednesdays. Brothers has trivia on Tuesdays. If you're interested in music I would recommend following the Instagram account \"munciemusicscene\" where they repost local house shows/concerts happening around town. \n\nThere really are interesting things to do in Muncie over the summer, but you need to look for them. :)",

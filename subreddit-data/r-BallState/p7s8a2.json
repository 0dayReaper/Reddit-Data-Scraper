Right after I graduated it came up that the owners were homophobic (cancelled a Pride event at another gym they owned, which ended up going under due to backlash) and they quickly/quietly packed up and moved somewhere in the PNW within a month or two. I have no idea if they still own the Muncie gym remotely or if they sold it, but I know it's still open.",

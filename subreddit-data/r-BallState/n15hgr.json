    "postText": "The Ball State campus Covid vaccine clinic is taking walk-ins for the Moderna vaccine! If you\u2019ve been meaning to get your vaccine, stop by the Health Professions building on Riverside (across from Woodworth). Tuesdays-Fridays from 10 am - 4 pm.\n\nThe earlier you arrive in the day, the more likely you will get a dose immediately. Towards the end of the day, all the doses available for the day may have been assigned, although some days doses are still available at the end of the day. \n\nYou do not need to get your second dose at the same location as your first dose.",

    "postText": "Hello all, I am an international applicant preparing to apply in the graduate program (2021 fall) of Ball State University. I have done my Masters in Psychology and will apply for educational psychology PhD program. I strongly feel that I should get in touch with any grad student (preferably one from my discipline) before initiating the application. The purpose is to get help on several grounds like, I would really like to know what this grad program expect from an applicant? How much research experience is required and how to structure my SOP in order to present myself as a good fit for the program?   \nHope to get help.",

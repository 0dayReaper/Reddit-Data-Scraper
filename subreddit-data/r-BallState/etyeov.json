The fact that he just called the police after arguing with the student is what is getting people\u2019s blood boiling.",

I'm sure if it was a white person or a hispanic, it wouldve been the same reaction. I bet people wouldn't protest if it was someone else though. That is someone's career you are fucking over. I hope it was worth it snowflake",

I would HIGHLY recommend living off campus if you don\u2019t care about getting your own groceries and the driving. If you\u2019re within that 60 mile radius at your home address, and you don\u2019t hate living with your family save yourself the money and stay there and drive if you\u2019re comfortable. If you don\u2019t want to stay at home, I would recommend either the village, the haven, or varsity house apartment complexes hopefully you can find roommates to live with you and that\u2019ll make it easier, if not those places will find roommates for you typically and you will save big bucks trust me. I had a friend who did that, worked at the Walmart (not terrible but I would recommend keeping your options open), and she has maybe $4,000 in debt she has to pay now. If you have to live on campus your freshman year because you\u2019re not within the radius, that is unfortunate and just what it is and you unfortunately do not get a say in what dorm you live in your first year, but I would recommend living off campus as soon as your able/comfortable. You will save so much more money that way I promise you.",

If you\u2019re comfortable with the possibility of random roomies (which you will have in college anyways most likely), driving to campus, and buying your own groceries, I say do this. You will save money and have a lot more privacy. I personally didn\u2019t go this route bc I don\u2019t have a license (fear of driving) and living on campus was much easier. If I could go back I would have gotten my license and lived off campus. I would have saved myself the debt",

I went to apply for a housing exemption and they said my first two semesters I have to live on campus. That\u2019s almost double the cost! I\u2019m transferring in as a sophomore. Do they give exemptions to transfer students that aren\u2019t freshmen?",

That\u2019s odd actually, I thought residency exemptions were based on credits, I would call housing and honestly try and argue this bc that seems fishy. I know for a fact I had friends who transferred to BSU after their freshman year and were able to get houses off campus",

    "postText": "Why is financial aid added to the ebill till the the day before or the last day that the ebill is due? Like that gives people very limited time, idk i can\u2019t just cash out the 2K minimum payment on the 11K bill they\u2019re giving me when i should only be paying 1K this whole semester with financial aid. What is the point of having the due date so close to that? It really makes it harder on everyone.",

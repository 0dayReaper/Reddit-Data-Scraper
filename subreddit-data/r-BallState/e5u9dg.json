            "comment": "MAC just isn't a very fun division, and we aren't a very good team. There's also just overall a culture of not going to games. Even when the football team was undefeated in 2008(??? I think) I was told that the student attendance was still surprisingly low. I was a BSU cheerleader my freshman year and did not try out again sophomore year because the games were so boring.\n\nSide note, props to the band/guard. They are always hype no matter what. Some people find it annoying but I always appreciated it.",

It was my first football game and it was somewhat hype but overall sad in comparison to other football games I've attended at other schools. I went to a lot of bsu sporting events growing up but only went to a couple when I actually attended. Kind of crazy each time I go now attendence looks lower each time. They feel like highschool sporting events attendence numbers a lot of the times.",

            "comment": "Personal theory based on my own experiences so it may not be applicable today. The same problem existed when I was at BSU in 2002 and my theory then was that it was because freshmen were allowed easy access to cars. Not only were freshmen allowed to have cars on campus (not allowed at IU or Purdue at the time I believe) but the cost to keep said car was minimal. \n\nMoreover, freshmen have to keep their cars at the stadium and are only allowed to park freely on the weekends. If there is a home football game they have to move their car. Freshmen with cars are already prone to return home on a random weekend for a home cooked meal, laundry, etc. When you\u2019re forced to move your car during a home football game and the dorms already have very limited parking it really wouldn\u2019t surprise me if some freshmen just take the opportunity to just gone home on those weekends. And when a school\u2019s freshmen are back at home on the weekends instead of at school attending school events in the fall (football game) then they are probably more likely to continue the same behavior throughout the year. And finally if Ball State can\u2019t get its freshmen energized into attending athletic events then those freshmen will be less likely to attend such events as sophomores, juniors, and seniors. \n\nTLDR: Cars. Many freshmen leave town on weekends and don\u2019t attend events during their first year here and are thus less and less likely to attend events and develop school spirit as sophomores, juniors, and seniors.",

All I see are home game schedules and that one video board at Worthen. There are some many TVs around campus. Can\u2019t they put start times, records, and spreads on a scroller at the bottom. At least get some hype blasting for rivalry games. Some posters maybe. In regards to football, the sidewalks on Bethel are so hard to walk on. IU students have a much easier ground to walk to their stadium.",

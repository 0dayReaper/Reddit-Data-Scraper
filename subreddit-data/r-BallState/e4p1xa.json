    "postText": "Final Posting to sublease my apartment- I have a fully furnished bedroom and private bathroom in a 4 bedroom (each room has its on lock available immediately).  It includes covered parking. Pool, hot tub, and gym are included. Cable tv is also included. The rent is $674 but I will pay $200 a month for the remainder of the lease so it will only be  (Lease ends at end of July). The other roommates are students at BSU.  I can send pics of the apartment complex if DM me.  You will just need to qualify with Village Promenade and take over the utilities. I need to rent this ASAP as I am no longer a student so please pass this along if you know someone. Thanks!",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm looking for a roommate to fill the vacant room in my 2BR apartment. \n\n[PICS HERE](https://imgur.com/a/44ZOPBI) \n\nWHERE:\nI live near the river in an area I really love. The exact address is 2400 W White River Blvd. Walking distance from Pay Less, bars, hobby stores, etc. Not to mention a park and running trail for the warmer months. I genuinely love living here and don't want to move.\n\nWHO: Me. I'm a graduate student in biology at Ball State. I'm on campus a lot and hanging out with friends sometimes. I'm easy to get along with. I enjoy memes, craft beer, and taking my dog to the park. We can be friends or just two people who split a cost. I don't give a fuck, but I find it's easier to be at least friendLY. Oh. I have a dog who lives with me who is just the best and will fill your every day with love. I also have a cat. She'll tolerate you. (J/K, she loved my old roommate.)\n\nWHEN: Sometime between now and January 3rd. My least renews that day. I'm open to someone moving in earlier than that if we talk about it. But ideally I'd like someone who is going to sign on for the full year Jan 2019-2020. \n\nHOW MUCH: Rent is $525 for the unit, so split evenly (as we would split it) it is $263.50/tenant. We do not pay for water. My average monthly utility cost over the past 3 months are: Gas - $22.36, Internet - $56.76 (same every month), electricity - $41.12. \n\nIf you know anyone looking for a place for Spring semester, please point them this way! Thank you!\n",

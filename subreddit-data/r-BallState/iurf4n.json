    "postText": "Howdy, my shoes have very rapidly given up the ghost and I'd like to get them repaired. Being not from Muncie, I have no idea where to get them fixed and the stores I found on Google either closed months ago, don't specify if they do shoe repair, or otherwise have something off about them. Anyone know of anywhere nearby I can get them fixed up?",

He gets backed up a lot (because he gets so many orders! When you're in his shop you'll see and understand), so expect about a month wait to get the shoes back. \n\nHe's a really nice guy though, and he does great work. Had 3 pairs of shoes re-soled and repaired by him. 11/10 recommend. Very affordable and realistic in describing what he can do for you. His work has held up beautifully as well.",

    "postText": "I received three emails about packages being delivered to my dorm. I went down to collect them after the first email and was told to wait an hour. I had to wait until after work to pick them up. I was only given two packages. I informed them that I had a third one and the front desk told me to come back at a later time and they would deal with it then. I had to go home this weekend and couldn\u2019t deal with the issue until today. I asked for the package again and it still can not be located. I showed the front desk again the email saying that the package was here and the email from Etsy saying it was delivered. The front desk said it was the right address but told me to wait again. Are there any steps I should take to get to the bottom of where my package is or some form of refund (the seller won\u2019t give one because the package did arrive at the right address)? I am just concerned because the package was my mother\u2019s Christmas present and I have several more on the way.",

They found it and made sure to prevent that from happening again supposedly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut also check with the mail office in the student center, they\u2019re usually able to help you.",

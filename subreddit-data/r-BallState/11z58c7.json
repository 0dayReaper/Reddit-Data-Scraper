    "postText": "for context, I am a transfer/reenrolling student for this upcoming fall semester. I left after my first semester as a freshman due to financial reasons, so I was never academically dismissed. My grades getting into ball state weren't anything special (2.9 gpa and 1180 SAT), but I've enjoyed post-secondary education quite a lot and ended up with a 3.66 (dean's list) gpa last time I was here at Ball State while being involved in extracurriculars/clubs, and I currently have maintained a 3.79 GPA at ivy tech (will be higher after this semester) and was accepted into their honors college program (I ended up not joining the program for personal reasons, though).\n\nUltimately I'm wondering if anyone with a similar experience has managed to get into ball state's honors college. I know it's a bit late to be applying, but I wanted some advice before I began the process.",

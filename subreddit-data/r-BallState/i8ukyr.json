I know we have to get tested before moving in, (or do the quarantine), but I was wondering how we are to show/prove our results once we get them? If there's a link, could someone comment it please, I couldn't find anything on the housing portal. I also heard rumor that you just bring a note of some sort ??? I'm confused and want to do this right.",

    "postText": "One of my courses this semester has a one year Relias Learning subscription as one of the required textbooks for the course. When purchasing it, does anyone know if I should order it delivered or pick-up? I\u2019m an online student in NC so would be unable to go and pickup in person but since this is a subscription service I imagine it\u2019s something they\u2019ll just send me an email or link or something and I\u2019ll set up an account. I just don\u2019t want to pick shipping because I don\u2019t want to have to pay a shipping fee if I don\u2019t have to",

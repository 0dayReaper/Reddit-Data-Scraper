There are basically different levels of STD you can get there. The most basic because it is the most common is for gonorrhea and chlamydia if I remember right and that was just 25 out of pocket. But they do testing for all of the other STDs as well and you can run it through your insurance if you have it. They called me two days later. They were very friendly and very helpful.",

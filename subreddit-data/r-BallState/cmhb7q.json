    "postText": " CITY HALL - MONDAY - 7:30p - 8/5  \nPlease change your Monday plans so you and your people can attend. We want to show 1000 strong in solidarity for the future of our community.  \n\n\nAs you\u2019ve read, there are plans for the largest facility emitting airborne mercury pollution in the United States to open on Kilgore. It would be 15th in the United States in lead emissions. That\u2019s 5x more lead than Exide, and 10x more particulates than Exide.   \n\n\n\\*Ask council members to reconsider their votes in favor of economic incentives for this proposed facility.\\*   \n\n\nIf you can't attend, light up those emails and phones.  \n\n\n Doug Marshall  \nDistrict #1  \ndougmarshall@comcast.net  \ndistrict1@cityofmuncie.com  \n(765)702-7951  \n\n\nDan Ridenour  \nDistrict #2  \ndan.ridenour@yahoo.com  \ndistrict2@cityofmuncie.com  \n(765)760-2118  \n\n\nLynn Peters  \nDistrict #3  \ndistrict3@cityofmuncie.com  \n(765)729-8138  \n\n\nBrad Polk  \nDistrict #4  \nbpolkdist4@gmail.org  \ndistrict4@cityofmuncie.com  \n(765)717-5498  \n\n\nJerry Dishman  \nDistrict #5  \ndishjd@netscape.net  \ndistrict5@cityofmuncie.com  \n(765)215-9747  \n\n\nJulius Anderson  \nDistrict #6  \njjanders125@gmail.com  \ndistrict6@cityofmuncie.com  \n(765)289-6639  \n\n\nDenise Moore  \nAt-Large  \ndmoore1956@hotmail.com  \n(765)215-1660  \n\n\nLinda Gregory  \nAt-Large  \nlindagregory@comcast.net  \n(765)286-2925  \n\n\nNora Powell  \nAt-Large  \nnpowellmuncie@gmail.com  \n(765)284-3991",

    "postText": "Hello, Music Education major (M) here, I\u2019m hoping to start up some in-person D&amp;D at a neutral space (Wizard\u2019s Keep by the river and the dining halls come to mind) or at my apartment if such a place is not available (just off campus). I\u2019d be wanting to start either in August or September, everyone fully vaccinated.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never played D&amp;D, but are interested in tabletop or roleplaying games, you\u2019re free to join as well. This is mostly a casual thing to meet new people and have a good time, not a serious affair or major investment.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, either DM me or comment below, thanks!",

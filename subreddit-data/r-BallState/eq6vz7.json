I've been playing for about 4 years now and really just want to meet some new people with similar hobbies as well. If you've got an opening in a game or know someone who does I'd love to meet you :)",

We are running Curse of Strahd currently. \n\nAlso is your username by chance a reference to the Ancient Egyptian god? I'm a huge history nerd and after CoS is done I'm thinking of running an Ancient Egyptian themed homebrew campaign, if that sounds interesting feel free to pm me.",

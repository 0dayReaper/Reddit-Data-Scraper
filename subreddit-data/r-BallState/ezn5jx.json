    "postText": "I am narrowing down my options for college this next school year, and Ball State is near the top. I will be going for CS. One thing that I found is that there, at least used to be, a cycling team. Looking at their social media, it hasn't been updated since mid 2018. Just wondering if there is still anything like this on campus, or some other local teams, or clubs?",

There is a group called DCC (Delaware Cycling Club) that is a local group that schedules weekly rides on Facebook.  They do a good job of announcing rides and offer a good combination of rides of differing lengths and pace - utilizing the Cardinal Greenway and/or county roads.  Some of these rides are high speed training rides.  Other rides are no-drop rides more for recreation.  DCC is inclusive and they're always welcoming to new riders.  I'm sure someone in that group could also speak to the existence of a BSU cycling team as well.",

I'm still figuring if it would even be practical for first year regarding training, storage, and everything. The Cardinal Greenway looks like an amazing trail system to ride, and makes it very tempting. Thanks again.",

They may have some more information and also have a phone number on their website: [http://d.bicycle.tripod.com/](http://d.bicycle.tripod.com/)\n\nIn general, roads near BSU seem to be always under some sort of construction or have potholes and aren't great for cycling. The Cardinal Greenway is your best bet for long rides. There are trailheads all around town. People aren't too thoughtful around cyclists on the country roads either because a lot of them are very narrow. You won't see as many on the roads (other than some BSU students) as you once did.",

Around where I'm from the drivers are usually pretty good on narrow roads. It's a shame to hear that the club faded out as well. I appreciate the info!",

I do have some questions (please disregard my ignorance if they are stupid), however since it's that new, I'm guessing there is still a lot to be sorted out.\n\n1: How would training work since I would be staying in a dorm, or what would you see as the most conceivable way to get it done? As in bringing a trainer and finding somewhere to use it, or would there be a place that we could go to train, when we can't be on the roads?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2: Just to clarify that this club includes road cycling? If yes, what is the collegiate road \"season\" like? As in, early spring while still in class, or through the summer?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3: What are the options for bike storage? Would it be best to see if dorm mate is ok with keeping it in dorm, keeping it locked where others put their bikes, or another place? If keeping it in a public place to lock bikes, how is the security? Obviously, my RB wouldn't get ridden around campus to class, I just want to make sure it would be safe where it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4: How are the local bike shops? Are there ones that are more performance oriented/\"higher end\", as in if I were to break an ultegra component, I would be able to get it fixed relatively quickly?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5: Would your club include training rides for the team during the week?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am also going to PM another question (or already did depending on when you read this)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I am asking a lot, but this makes me really excited, and puts another huge step toward solidifying my decision to attending BS. Again, please excuse my ignorance.",

Right now we are very new so we are trying to get a solid training schedule but mainly we are just some dudes that like to ride. We are competing this spring in a few races in Bloomington and Ann Arbor Michigan. We ride road and right now it's just two of us. We both have mountain bikes and the president has raced MTN bike too. There is one high end shop down town called Kirks that's pretty good, and another a little farther down the road. They're both reliable. I'm sure you could find a place to use a trainer. Right now I haven't been riding much because I'm training for a marathon lol. And you're good man the club is super new but we are excited to get new members and grow a team! If you look further back into my Strava you could see some of my rides, we don't draft off of each other and Muncie is very windy lol. You're fast! Just followed you on strava. If I didn't answer any of your questions or have more feel free to dm me!",

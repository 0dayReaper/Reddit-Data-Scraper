Like that doesn't make it any better.\n\nYou seriously need to look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself if college  is the right thing for you.\n\nYou're spending thousands of dollars on school and you might not even make it out.\n\nI've been a graduate TA on a 101 class for 2 years now and I've seen a lot of people that have your mindset and expect to graduate.\n\nAnd guess what, they've all flunked because they think they're too smart to put some effort for my class.",

And I honestly don't wanna be in college, just here to get a degree because it looks better when I start applying for jobs. Trust me I'm not shallow minded in thinking that I'll pass a class without effort. I understand my mistakes and I'm working to pass them. And considering you don't even know whats going on in my life it kinda bothers me that you would make that assumption about me. I'm where I am for a reason and I'm working to get past it, its just hard for me.",

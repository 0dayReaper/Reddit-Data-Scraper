I'm in his 9:00 lecture, and I can only make it half the time when I'm not held over in my first class. Is there anyone in there who can help me by telling me how far we get in the notes so I know what to do to be on track when I take them online? Thank you to anyone who can help!!",

In the beginning of the year he mentioned that it would be okay to just do it completely online and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing... it\u2019s helped a lot! Idk if that\u2019s viable for you but it\u2019s been helping me tons! He posts every lecture online. Hope this helps!",

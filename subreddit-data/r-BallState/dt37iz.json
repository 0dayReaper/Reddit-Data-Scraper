    "postText": "I have a stadium parking pass and am currently living in the dorms, but I've recently started a job as a delivery driver and the buses don't run by the time I get home after closing most nights. I was wondering if there are any places off campus and close enough to the dorms that allow street parking, or even parking lots around campus that don't require permits. I've heard the church behind Deho has worked for some people, and someone else told me they left their car at Ball Memorial Hospital and nothing happened. Just trying to see if anyone else had experience with this and knows where I could leave my car overnight/during the days I don't work (also: this will only be a short term thing, as I have a lease on a house nearby that starts this summer)",

    "postText": "Hi, i\u2019m currently in my one night stay dorm at orientation and looking back at all the information that i was given, i have so many questions and worries that i have no idea where to go or what to do. The field i plan on entering is graphic design mostly dealing with art with photoshop, but no one in my orientation group wanted to follow the same path, so i never got the chance to meet someone in my field, or compare art with them. Does anyone happen to have any tips on meeting new people or how to actually not increase anxiety? This happens to be my dream college and i\u2019ve been following this career path since elementary school, it means a lot to myself and everyone around me that i made it this far, and i really just want to make the best of it without any worries.",

            "comment": "I went to orientation back in 2016 and felt the same.  I was an apparel design major and while I'm not anymore, I was the only one in my group who was so I understand how you feel.  I didn't really click with anyone at orientation but once I moved into the dorms and all that I tried out clubs and met people that way.  If you'll be living in a dorm(I'm assuming so since most freshman do and it's kinda required), leave you're door open when you're in the room and go to events on your floor or in your building.   There's an activity fair every year with all kinds of clubs and student organizations so check it out when you get the chance.  I know that some majors have specific clubs for students who want to do more outside of class so be on the lookout for something like that when looking for clubs and maybe it can help you connect with other people in your major.  If not, give the other clubs a shot if they interest you and you'll never know what you'll find!  \n\n\nMy freshamn year I didn't really leave my dorm door open a lot cause I was just the introvert kid but the few times I did I met some cool people.  We didn't become besties but it kinda made the experience a lot less lonely.  Just remember that a lot of students in your building are likely just as new or as nervous as you so don't be afraid to reach out to anyone.  If you have trouble or need someone I'm sure there's always someone around on this subreddit who will help! :)",

I did the CLASS program and I had a blast and felt way more comfortable after the program ended. And I met some cool people that im still very close with.",

I was able to meet a handful of friends so that I didn't eat (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) alone every day. Any time I was in a dining hall, I'd see some of the people I did the program with and they would invite me over to eat with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few of the people were in my major (started with Telecommunication and then switched to Family Consumer Science) but the majority weren't. But my first few years I wasn't taking many major classes anyway. If I were to do it all over again, I'd still go to this program because it really helped me adjust to living away from home and getting used to life at Ball State.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple other pieces of advice--use sites like this to make connections. My freshman roommate and I met on a facebook group for incoming freshman--who knows if that's still a thing anymore or not, but look into it! Other people are also saying to go to the club fair, which I definitely agree with! And finally, once you get assigned a dorm and you're moved in... do your best to leave your door open when you're in and participate in floor/building wide activities as you can. That's the one thing I wish I had done more of, but I was a super shy kid at the time... the last 12 years has seen me grow a lot in confidence and sociability. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd don't forget to have fun!",

            "comment": "Class of 2016 checking in!\n\nLook for clubs that you have an interest in and go to their meetings. There is usually an activity fair within the first week or two of school and I highly recommend you go alone to that so you can stop by the booths YOU like and not feel the pressure to do what your friend group will want. Don't be afraid to do other things outside of your field. I joined a sketch comedy group as a business major. The experience from that actually related to my field AND  I met close friends that I still talk to even now. You'll meet plenty of graphic design majors through class. Look to broaden your horizons outside of that as well.\n\nI was never involved with Greek life. No regrets at all. If that's up your alley, then by all means, but you will still get the full experience without it. No pressure to rush.\n\nI know a guy who had gone through the graphic design track at BSU. Graduated in my class I think. Adding that in to let you know it is possible to get through the courses and come out the other side. You'll be fine. Plus he does work in his field with freelance design.\n\nBest advice from my time there: Manage your time, know your priorities, and compartmentalize. When you're having fun, do that all the way. When you're doing homework or in class, be 100% in that moment. That helped me juggle multiple jobs and school, plus social time, clubs, and the adulting that comes with roommates and renting a place without parents to supply toilet paper or pay the electric bill.\n\nRandom bits of advice: Don't feel like you have to buy everything your professors tell you. Don't buy books until a week after classes start. The first week is going over syllabuses (syllabi?) anyway. You can go from Robert Bell to the Atrium without going outside when it's raining. Get some hell insoles or something because there is a good amount of walking. Office hours are there for you, not the prof, so use them without thinking you're a bother. BSU Parking Services are legit on it so don't think you can leave your car somewhere illegally for even a minute without getting a ticket. And HAVE FUN! College is radically different from the real world, enjoy it!\n\nYou'll be fine, man. You got this!",

You can look through some of the orgs on campus here:  [https://bsu.campuslabs.com/engage/organizations](https://bsu.campuslabs.com/engage/organizations) .  \n\n\nAnother thing to prevent stress down the road that I suggest is checking out RateMyProfessor at some point to help you figure out what professors to choose. First week of classes are usually pretty chill, with people still changing their schedule and professors usually just talking about class expectations. You don't usually need to buy the books until after/during that week. It should give you time to get adjusted to finding your classes, and making sure your schedule works for you.  \n\n\nNot sure when you get access, but Ball State's Canvas website will have links to all your classes. If you really want to prepare and know more about a class, you can look through what your professors have posted.  \n\n\nOverall, just take your time and find things out as you go. Just remember to pace yourself, as you don't need to tackle everything at once.",

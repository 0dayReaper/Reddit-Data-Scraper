    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm looking for someone to sublease a room from a four bedroom apartment. The rent is pretty low at $350 a month, which you can go through financial aid if you like. The lease term is yearly and will be from August 1st, 2021 to July 30th, 2022. \n\nI have pictures for anyone interested and I am more than willing to talk about the place. If you are on campus I can give you a tour as well, however my belongings will still be there. My lease will be up after the summer, but I am willing to pay first month's rent if you are actually interested. \n\nThanks for your time!",

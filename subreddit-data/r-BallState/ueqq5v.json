            "comment": "Hello!\n\nGreat question and I\u2019d be happy to share some experience as a recent CS graduate! \n\nCS120 is a fantastic class to get the program started. I had the class with Professor Largent which made the class a blast and more fun than just reading a book and doing exercises. As for content, when I took it, it was a little funky using a language called Jython, a unique mix of Python and Java. With this in mind though, don\u2019t focus on the language but more the practices you learn. \n\nThe class has lots of discussions, some team assignments (usually duos to practice pair programming), and even an art show which is just a goofy fun project. Overall a very fun and relaxed class and a good first step before some of the tougher theory classes. \n\nI know that response is a little all over the place so let me know if you have any specific questions and I\u2019d be happy to answer them!",

Overall, is the work load very hard especially with the thought of other classes to manage in your schedule?",

I think I\u2019d confidently say that CS 120 is a very easy class to juggle and balance. \n\nThere is never a massive overload of work and if you struggle, working with classmates is very easy, plus usually there is some work time at the end of class at least when I took it.",

His grading scale is very wacky and you have to be extremely consistent. To get an A in the course you have to get an A on all assignments with an exception of I think one or two. If you get a B in 3 or more assignments, congrats your grade now can't go higher than a B, even if the percentage equates to an A.",

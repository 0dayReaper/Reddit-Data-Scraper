At my undergrad college, there was a group of students that informally played each week with whoever showed up. Does anything like this exist at Ball State? Thanks!",

I also saw people playing in the field between Deho and First Pres almost daily on my walk home when the temps weren't frigid. Not sure if that was the club or a pickup game.   \n\n\nETA: This was last year, I graduated in May",

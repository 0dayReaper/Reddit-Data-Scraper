            "comment": "I posted this comment on another post on this sub, but I have been typing the same thing over and over again to explain to my friends the issues with moving all classes online, that I just don't feel like typing it again.\n\nI feel like if they cancel in person classes and kick everyone off campus, all they will do is go home and take the virus with them to their family and friends. Canceling in person classes will not cancel off campus parties and people will go to them. You want proof of people already partying, look at that one guy the other day who posted about his party he had during welcome week with no one social distancing. People have said that he had videos throughout the summer going to parties and no one social distancing. I also feel though it will be less consequences to those who are partying if classes are online. You can make a case to suspend or expel students who are not following guidelines if classes are in person.\n\nI feel like the better option would to have classes all online for two weeks, Ball State strictly enforcing no off campus parties and start suspending or expelling students having those parties and social distancing guidelines then go back in class.\n\nI feel like its better for stuff on campus to happen with strict enforcing social distancing and keeping watch of students. The issue is that Ball State has been pretty slow in their attempts to slow down the spread of COVID.",

I'm tired of being forced to sit with asymptomatic students and then getting blamed for it. If they want to close to dorms then everyone needs to be tested before going home and anyone who has it can quarantine in their OWN dorm before going home. This avoids getting families sick.",

I mean, most of my professors have been cool with the flexibility allowing students to do it through Zoom.  The thing I am sick of is everyone trying to simplify things and blaming one particular thing when in reality, a lot of things should be blamed.",

Housing situation, dining, night life, campus security, working out and any other things you think an incoming student should know. Graduated from ISU so my colors and mascot won\u2019t change for football games! Thanks!",

Also there is a bubble around the uni and many ppl don't get out into the city much. Seems pretty safe for a city of its size but I think the uni has its own set of crime issues, like theft and assault. I was a little disappointed in the rigor of my grad department but that is on me for not researching enough.\n\nIf you like the midwest, I think you'll like it here.",

            "comment": "Housing is mostly cheap, but start looking for a place as soon as you get your acceptance. The nicer places near campus book up quickly. You can probably find a nice place at a good price by looking for people who have dropped out/transferred trying to sublease their room. I personally always really liked UPD. There were a few times that I really needed them and they were a big help. The campus rec center is a beautiful facility. There are also two YMCAs and a Planet Fitness nearby if you don't like the vibe of the rec center. Minnetrista is a nearby park where you can take a lovely run or bike.\n\nNightlife in the village is limited to like 2.5 bars, but many of the grad students head to downtown Muncie where the more lowkey/chill bars are. Food: lots of chains but there are some good local places too.",

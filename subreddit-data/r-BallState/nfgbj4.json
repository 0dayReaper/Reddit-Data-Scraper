I got a big sculpted stone dragon with a lamp built in for $20 and the only issue was it was missing part of an arm. That's probably the coolest place to go for trinkets and such. So to summarize, Atti Window for clothes, Habitat for Humanity ReStore for furniture, and Captain Rob's Bargain Bin for trinkets/memorabilia.",

There is also the Vintage Shoppe downtown that\u2019s worth checking out. For more unique items checkout the antique shops around town including Mulberry Street Uniques and Old 67 Antique Mall.",

I went to Attic Window for the first time last Thursday and they didn\u2019t have much I was interested in and I found the men\u2019s clothing section small, but they usually are in most thrift stores.",

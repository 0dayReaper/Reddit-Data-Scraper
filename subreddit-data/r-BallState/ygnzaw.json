    "postText": "Does anyone have any recommendations for good professors that teach ENG 104? The class is one of the last classes I have left on the core curriculum that isn't related to my major, so I want a professor who won't screw me over when I take their class. I've looked on RateMyProfessor, but there's just so many professors teaching it in the Spring Semester that I want to narrow it down a bit more than what RateMyProfessor shows.",

            "comment": "The problem is partly because campus did not do a good job setting up optional testing for those not symptomatic and also no way to report if someone tested negative elsewhere, of the ~25,000 students .1% of the student population that has been tested doesn't seem significant as testing is only done to those who are showing symptoms so as of now they're seeing 99% of the students aren't even showing symptoms enough to be tested and (should be) masking and sanitizing so that should stop more spreading.\n\nIf the campus wants an accurate count of how bad it is they need to start trying to make optional or required (no symptom) testing a thing at least once a month to those on campus. Will also help with getting on top of spreading and containing those who should be isolating.",

Go one step further and have stickers on the back of our IDs for when we were last tested and have to be renewed every 2 weeks to month. For added bonus, disable our ID (tap, swipe, and barcode for the few that still have it) if we don't have a recent test. Then have a simple way to see if this person had a test come back negative for dining, classes, and offices.\n\nHave UPD patrol frat houses and the off campus apartments and if there's parties or large gatherings take name and send to Dean of students to expell. They've had plenty of warnings and I have 0 sympathy for those people who choose to have large parties still.",

While it might be hard to get there for some there is a site at the National Guard armory on the east side of Muncie. I got my test back in 48 hours. I read before that appointments and walk-ins are welcome, not sure if that's still the case",

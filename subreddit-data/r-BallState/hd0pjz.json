I don\u2019t know of many good skateparks in Muncie tbh, but there is a bowl/shop somewhere in downtown muncie. I forget the name of the place tho",

Someone told me once that there is a private ramp in a barn or some shit that's close, but I never herd anything else about it.\n\nThe closest park that isn't a complete dumpster fire is Newcastle, so you'll have to drive like 35 minutes. At that point, though, you might as well just drive to majors (IMO).\n\nAs far as on campus goes there's some decent handrails and shit all over, but upd will get shitty with you. So choose your battles.\n\nAlso, McKinley (main road through campus) has brick sidewalks. Longboards do fine, but anything with small wheels kinda sucks.",

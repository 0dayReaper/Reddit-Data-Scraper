I am looking for housing options and applied for the University apartments but there are hardly anyone that I can see on the portal to find a roommate. I am unsure about the neighborhood (safety, and distance) as I have never been to Muncie, Indiana. Any leads where I can find a house with a roommate?",

            "comment": "The university Apartments are by the stadium and have BSU shuttle stops. BSU is surrounded by students mostly, so it\u2019s not around bad neighborhoods. There are 2-3 versions of university apartments on the campus, but I\u2019ve never lived in them.\n\nAnother place to look into is Varsity House ([https://www.yugomuncievarsityhouse.com/](https://www.yugomuncievarsityhouse.com/)) ; they match you up with others and you have your own room and bathroom. Varsity house also has a shuttle that makes runs to campus. Varsity house, I lived there 3 years ago, had a lot of amenities and was a gated community with a pool.\n\nBoth places are along or near McGalliard, which is one of the main roads in Muncie. Both places are walking distance (10+ minutes at least) if needed to campus, though shuttles are better.\n\nThere is also the village promenade ([https://villagepromenade.com/](https://villagepromenade.com/)) on the edge of campus and is where a lot of students hang out. It\u2019s closer to campus than Varsity house, a 5min walk or so. They match you also, I believe. I haven\u2019t lived here, but it\u2019s like Varsity House.   \n\n\nHope this helps.",

The University apartments cost around 400$ including utilities for a 2-bedroom sharing apartment. I am not sure if this is the lowest price or can we find apartments around the neighborhood with the same pricing?",

There are house around campus that rent by bedroom, which can start around $375 plus share of utilities. Anything around downtown will be higher priced and further away from campus; at least a 20min walk.",

One of the apartments I listed had a hottub. There is a convenient bus route that runs like clockwork. I used the bus even though I had a car to go to class because on campus parking is annoying. I always felt safe in muncie. Downtown, walmart, on campus ect. It\u2019s a small town college town.",

    "postText": "Hey all, I am in incoming freshman living in Dehority this fall and my roommate and I want to bring a futon and a TV, but I dont want to loft my bed high. (I\u2019m fine with lofting it in order to fit stuff like my dresser and fridge but not to put my desk under) I was wondering if anyone had any set ups that would help or pictures of their dorm set up in deho??? thanks!",

However, neither my roommate nor I had a futon when we lived there, so it's hard to say.\n\nEdit: is your roommate okay with lofting their bed? If so you could put the futon under there and both dressers under yours maybe. Not sure if that would work, just spitballing.",

There isn't a lot of space left in the room after that though. And I think they had their dressers in the closet which doesn't work in deho iirc. Works great in Johnson and kinghorn though.",

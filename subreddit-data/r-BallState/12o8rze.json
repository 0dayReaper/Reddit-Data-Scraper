You learn some interesting math in it and some neat shortcuts towards the beginning (such as solving for three variables with three equations).\n\nI\u2019d say calc 3 was easier than differential equations for my personal experience. I took calc 3 as a freshman before linear algebra and discrete math, and it was doable but made the class 100% harder. Some key vocabulary and concepts are taught in discrete and linear e.g. proof types and orthogonality respectively. \n\nDifferential equations almost blew me off the map. I think a huge reason for that is because I took it in fall 2020, the first full COVID semester. The class was all online and while the professor was amazing, without face to face instruction it was insanely difficult. I had to email the professor constantly to help with the homework\u2019s and projects. \n\nI\u2019m happy to talk about any math class you may have a question with and I\u2019ll tell you my experiences. I took quite a bit of them, but not all!",

    "postText": "Hey Cardinals,\n\nI graduated in 2018, am a Hoosier through and through, and now live in Florida. Recently had a quick chat with a kid asking for advice about college, and consistently I\u2019ve had the same general answer: if you\u2019re looking to make it cheaper + get great leadership experience, become an RA.\n\nI took a swing my Junior year to interview as an RA, and wish I\u2019d done it sooner as a Sophomore. In terms of general perks: free housing + food + a monthly stipend. That\u2019s literally getting paid for everything each semester other than your tuition. I was a 21st Century Scholar, which made the year completely free. I made money off of college.\n\nAnd in terms of leadership, I learned a ton about managing others and communicating. Roll your eyes, but in the professional world, trust me: that kind of skillset matters.\n\nTruly can\u2019t say enough about the experience. If you go for it, give a shit, show you care, and can be a leader, being an RA at BSU will literally save you thousands of dollars and help your future.\n\nDM me if you have any questions or want advice.",

            "comment": "Thank you for sharing. I also was an RA for two years while at Ball State. I loved the experience. And I chose not to be one of those authoritarian jerks who made life miserable for their residents (or \u201ckids\u201d as we called them even though they were nearly our age)\u2026. Some let that bit of power go to their heads. I was not that guy. And yes, the perks are very nice. And you are correct, you learn a lot of things: mediation skills, leadership, collaboration, etc. In my experience, I have found that having \u201cresident assistant\u201c on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has only helped me in my job prospects. It isn\u2019t for everyone, but if you are thinking about it, at least learn some more",

    "postText": "So as I was wandering through the David Letterman building, I noticed the Spiritual Life Fair, with a variety of Christian ministries. As a newly arrived grad student, I will admit that many of them seem quite similar, outside of a few denominationally distinctive groups. Most, if not all, hosted some form of worship and bible study. If there's anyone on here who attends them, what sort of distinctions have you noticed? What made you choose one over the other? Was it a matter of schedule? Doctrine? Community? Or something else?",

            "comment": "I checked out Cru and Navs as a freshman. \n\nCru is by far the biggest, and they have a lot of smaller groups (dorms, majors, etc) you can be a part of. I stopped going because I felt very judged because of my involvement in Greek life. However that was years ago and everyone I was there with at the time has graduated by now, so I still think you should look into it. I liked almost everything else about it, just be prepared for a lot of people.\n\nNavs was a lot smaller and more intimate. I really liked their mission and camaraderie. \n\nI stopped attending both Cru and Navs due to a low point in my faith, nothing really to do with the groups. I would recommend checking out both and seeing what you like best about each. It's just a different vibe from each group. I can't think of any religious groups on campus that you should avoid.\n\nAlso, I had some peers who were very involved with Cardinal Catholic and LOVED it. I am not Catholic but it seemed like a very fun group of people!",

            "comment": "I attended the Baptist Collegiate Ministry (BCM). It was a much smaller group than any I had previously been too. Met in Robert Bell 125 (I think? The big lecture hall in the first floor of RB) on Tuesday nights, but I don't remember what time. I think the biggest I ever saw BCM get was about 40 people. There were only 20-25 when I first showed up.\n\nI personally knew the director/leader of the BCM at the time, so I knew his doctrine. Definitely Baptist in theology, but kinda surface-y in the worship, I thought... not that there's anything bad with that in any way! I went to a few Cru and Nav meetings, and they felt just as, if not more surface-y/watered down. Honestly, on a secular campus, you're not going to get a lot of deep, hard doctrines.\n\nThe thing I liked about BCM though, is that the director stressed getting involved with local churches, and mentioned multiple times that \"BCM should not be your church replacement while at college.\" We even had a few events to help people visit other nearby churches and get involved.\n\nThat director has since left, and idk who leads it now. It was student-lead for a while.",

            "comment": "Just for clarity, this from a male perspective, as my experience has been pretty divided into male/female activities other than a few big events.\n\nI\u2019m personally involved with Chi Alpha on campus and they\u2019re good for community and small groups, as well as small events (regularly play basketball and have Super Smash Bros nights). \n\nIt is technically a Pentecostal denomination called \u201cAssemblies of God\u201d, but you\u2019ll find that the denomination pool is quite varied, but a lot would claim non-denominational. \n\nThe worship nights is where I tend to struggle in general, and I usually don\u2019t end up attending. This isn\u2019t a big deal though, and most people won\u2019t judge you for it if you have something going on. It is a co-ed service. I personally don\u2019t tend to like typical church sessions though, but mostly because I\u2019m a pretty private person with my faith a lot of the time.\n\nI can\u2019t speak on any other campus organizations, but I hope that helps with Chi Alpha. PM me and I can get you more info on who to contact if you\u2019re interested.",

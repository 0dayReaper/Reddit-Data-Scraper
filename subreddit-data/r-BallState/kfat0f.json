    "postText": "I recently just finished my master of public administration at ball state. Today I gathered my Ball jar of Muncie Dirt, to my surprise many of my fellow students and co-workers (I am a GA for another day) didn\u2019t know about this tradition.\n\nI was told, way back in 2015 that after you complete your schooling at Ball State University you should collect a Ball Jar of dirt, gather from somewhere on campus or around Muncie. \n\nHas anyone else done this? Have I been believe in a lie? Have I been living in some strange ideology of dirt collecting?",

    "postText": "So I got accepted into the Honors College and got the Presidential Scholarship. However, I got the decision back really fast, and I\u2019m wondering how hard it was to get accepted in the first place...how many students are typically accepted each year? \nI also got an email that said I should apply for the Whitinger Scholarship, because I have an \u201coutstanding record of academic achievement, even compared to other Honors College Applicants\u201d, which made me wonder how prestigious the honors college and scholarship even is, since I have a 4.2 and only a 1280 SAT. Should I even bother applying for the Whitinger Scholarship? I pretty much only did band and orchestra throughout high school, and I\u2019m going to be an education major.\nI\u2019d really appreciate any insight from current or past honors college students. Thanks \ud83d\ude0a",

To graduate with honors you have to meet some additional requirements I believe? It\u2019s hard for me to remember now as it was last year. I opted to pick up a second major and just be fine with that. However, you do get some perks: living in DeHo, which is a pretty nice dorm, and early class registration. That\u2019s about all I know. As far as I know it isn\u2019t super exclusive, but they don\u2019t let just any student in. No idea on the exact number. And yes, you should apply to the scholarship! Don\u2019t ever not apply to something because you feel you aren\u2019t qualified because you\u2019re not the one who gets to decide that anyways! Let them decide. Good luck!",

            "comment": "I graduated from the Honors College back in 2014. When I applied back in 2011 they thought my GPA of 3.8 was too low, so I begged them to look at how insanely tough my high school experience was, then they let me in. The funny thing about this was that a bunch of kids with amazing GPAs dropped out only a semester or 2 after getting in. It's definitely not for everyone and it doesn't really have a ton to do with academic achievement.\n\nI took 3 types of classes in undergrad, Ball State required general classes, my major classes, and Honors College classes. Ball State classes were so boring and easy that I felt like I learned basically nothing from them. My major classes were obviously great because I cared about the subject matter. Honors College classes were actually really interesting to me because they blended all the elements of the humanities (history, literature, debate, philosophy, etc.) in a really well taught way that actually helped me learn how to learn. From what I remember most of the classes were just reading books and discussing them in class, which I prefer for teaching humanities style courses. Now that I'm in grad school the class style is actually really similar. They trust that the students are smart and are willing and able to learn about things, which is much less rigorous and painful to me compared to classes that force students via testing to make sure they're learning.\n\nAs far as what it means afterwards, if you're planning on staying in academia or education then having \"Honors College\" slapped on your degree probably means something and will be valuable in the future. In my field I don't think it means a ton, science values field experience a lot more than grades and degree achievements.",

Best thing (iirc) could be free college! \n\nHonors college was great for getting priority registration for classes (!!!) and my freshman year ('12), DeHo was pretty much the only renovated dorm freshmen could get, and then Park was nice too. Not sure what the housing is like now because I know some new buildings went up/opened since then. You can always drop it if it's too much or the perks aren't worth the effort. \n\nChirp chirp!",

            "comment": "An advantage for me was not having to worry about fulfilling Ball State's tiers. Aside from your major classes, Honors courses will fulfill pretty much every other requirement for getting a bachelor's degree (like, you don't have to worry about getting into a writing-focused class, since all honors courses are writing focused). \n\nIf you've already been accepted, I don't really see the point of not doing it. It's not too much extra work, and in some cases can be easier - if you know how to write, you will breeze through the classes. I know several people who dropped out sophomore or junior year once they finished needing priority registration. \n\nYou will be required to do a thesis. Sometimes, you can combine it with the capstone requirement if your major has one. I've never really seen anybody struggle with the thesis, as it's usually building off of work they've already done or it's a creative project. \n\nI enjoyed the classes a lot, especially because you could pick and choose what interests you. For instance, I took colloquiums about terrorism and about women in the ancient world. Both had nothing to do with my majors, but were quite interesting and a fun break. \n\nThe worth of having a Honors College diploma does depend on what your intended career would be. If you think you'll go to grad school, I'd say it's worth it; if you think it could set you apart from others while job-hunting, I would do it.",

            "comment": "Hey! What type of education major are you going to be? I'm a music ed major, and you mentioned band and orchestra. In the honor's college, some of the requirements are that you have to take more, higher level classes. Music education is one of the busiest degrees here. It is extremely hard to combine the two and graduation in four years, which I was lucky enough to find out from some friends, and was able to drop the honors college. It doesn't do much for your degree, and while DeHo is bigger, I've heard terrible things about noise levels throughout the night. I don't know about general education, but if you are music ed and don't do honors, you'll end up in Studebaker East or Noyer if Stu East fills up, and both are good. Just wanted to let you know!!",

            "comment": "Hey u/alyssajs62, Honors College Senior here. Sorry that this is a reply that's several days late. I was a recipient of a couple of additional scholarships other than the Presidential Scholarship, and to be honest I'm not sure if it was more because of my academic high school achievements or because of my borderline-FAFSA qualifying status. I had a 4.46 GPA in high school and I believe a 1310 SAT. I played Varsity Basketball and was an NHS member.  My roommate my freshman year had nowhere near my credentials and still got in. Smart guy, just not a fantastic student. \n\nI would 100% recommend applying for the Whitinger Scholarship, but also look into more scholarships offered through the Honors College. I recommend e-mailing Dr. Emert (Dean of Honors College) about additional opportunities. If you establish a relationship with him, it's more likely for you to be considered for a scholarship. \n\nAlso, as much as I have enjoyed the Honors College experience, many do not enjoy it. More is expected of you from a GPA standpoint. I personally stayed though mostly because of the scholarships I was receiving that I would have to sacrifice if I left. I say you try it out, get your DeHority perks for a year, and the evaluate from there. If you aren't getting any additional scholarships, it's your choice really. I wish you best of luck. I'm also assisting my cousin who is possibly coming next year to the Honors College with this process, so feel free to shoot me a message if you have more questions as your decision and scholarship process goes on!",

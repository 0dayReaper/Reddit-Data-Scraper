It's honestly a shame that the chapter turned into an absolute poop fiesta after some of the older classes moved out of the house. \n\nI lived in the house the first time it ever happened and I did my damndest to punish the individual to the fullest extent. He was removed from the chapter,  school, and organized fixation as a whole. Unfortunately, I had to move on at some point and couldn't hold people accountable after I graduated. \n\nThe chapter has been removed from campus until fall of 2022 as far as I know.",

Since BSU backed their loan on their house, one of the conditions is that they have an active chapter. Since their charter was revoked, they also lost all capital they had into the house as BSU repossessed it. So it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be back anytime soon.",

The Alumni organization of the Delta Kappa chapter owns that house and it is only being rented out temporarily till the chapter can be reinstated on campus.",

I put a lot into the organization and always felt like I got little to nothing back for my efforts such as recruiting one of the largest recent freshmen classes. I was eventually kicked out during a reorg with a group of 8-10 other good members and friends because we liked to smoke weed and the rest of the leadership/alumni hated weed. I guess they had to make room for rapists and assaulters.",

From what I hear, it's in the prosecutor's hands. Dustin has been charged with multiple counts of felony theft. I don't know if he'll plead out or if it will go to trial. If it goes to trial, I may be asked to testify that my video is mine, but that wouldn't happen for months. ",

Someone told me that that could be the guy, though obviously I wouldn't want to rush to judgement in case it's not.   \n\n\nAlso, the guy was seen stealing a box off a porch today. He had on the same Nike shoes with bright orange swooshes, and he had on the same black coat. He was wearing a red hoodie, looked to be Ball State. He also had on a black baseball cap with either a red bird or a red B on it.",

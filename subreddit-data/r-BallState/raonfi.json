            "comment": "Pros: - the education program is good, public school focused, and practical. (I am a secondary English Ed major) Plus I hear there are quite a few scholarship opportunities for elementary Ed majors. \n- generally good value for your money here. Most dorms are nice and the food is pretty good (for college food)\n- quite a few extra curriculars are offered here. If you were in band in high school you\u2019ll love it here especially, but there are lots of things\n- not too big, not too small. It is a true mid sized university.\n\nCons:\n- Muncie. It\u2019s alright, it has about one of every department store and restaurant you might want, but Bloomington, West Lafayette, and Indy are all more interesting cities than Muncie. \n- could have a better reputation. But for your major in particular, it is a good and solid choice. \n- only one foundation on campus \ud83e\udd72 but that\u2019s a personal gripe lol",

When I went, I didn\u2019t know anybody there and had a great time meeting new people all the time. \nAs a student, you get free tickets to all sporting events.  I mean it\u2019s not a big ten school, but games are still a good time. Tailgating for football games is always a blast. \n\nCon\u2026 in the winter, it\u2019s f\u2019ing cold and windy all the time. And I was in Johnson, which wasn\u2019t close to anything, so you really learn to dress for it pretty quick. \nYou\u2019ll want to move off campus pretty quick, so you don\u2019t have to go home anytime the campus shuts down.",

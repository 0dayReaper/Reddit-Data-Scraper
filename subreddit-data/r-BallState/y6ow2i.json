I think they tore that building down and built a Taco Bell. \n\nNobody went there because the food was good. They went because they were drunk and didn\u2019t know any better.\n\nAlso, Carter died 3 years ago. I heard he was helping some other guys out get a hot dog food truck up and going, but I have no idea how true that is, or if those guys are still around.",

You gotta join a club or even try and get to know some of your next door neighbors in the dorm.\n\n I'm very introverted so it's very hard for me but once you find people who share the same interests it gets way easier. Don't worry, you'll make friends soon, as long as you want to it'll happen eventually.",

I was used to a ton of friends in high school and knew only a couple people that went to BSU.  I never had to learn to approach people.  Then I just decided that that\u2019s what I was going to do.  Now with Covid, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s tougher.  But there were so many times in class, when I would just ask for a pen (even though I had one already) or would ask someone on my floor for some sort of help that I didn\u2019t necessarily need.  But doing those types of things really helped start conversations. Some led to nothing.  Others led to friendships that I still have.   You\u2019re in the same boat as so many others.  Just put yourself out there",

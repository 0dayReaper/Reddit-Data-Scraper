    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman at BSU and I'm just curious how safe the campus is in general. Are there places to avoid? Certain shops or stores to not go to? On campus security? I just wanna make sure me and my roomate are gonna be safe and not end up becoming a statistic which is sad to say but that's the world we live in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm just curious to hear from actual students and not the website\n\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for all your advice this is really helping me settle my nerves for when I move in and start the semester!!",

If you\u2019re cognizant of your surroundings, you\u2019ll be fine. If you\u2019re under the influence of anything, your general safety can decrease, particularly if you are alone, but that\u2019s the same as anywhere. \n\nThere is campus security. There are also blue light boxes around campus with a button that calls the police that you can press if you feel unsafe. There\u2019s also Charlie\u2019s Charter, so if you\u2019re somewhere on campus and you need a ride or you feel unsafe, you can call them for free, particularly after hours. \n\nThere are truths to some of the college stereotypes, which remain true at Ball State. Sexual assault, domestic abuse, violence, bullying/hazing, drug use, etc are all things that can and do happen on or near campus, but are not unique to Ball State or Muncie. The most important things you can do for your own safety are to be aware of your surroundings, trust your instincts even if it makes you feel uncool or \u201cother,\u201d and be particular about who you surround yourself with or are friends with.\n\nI hope you enjoy Ball State and get the most out of your college experience!",

They just happened to be reported more BECAUSE it's safer than most other places. Now, most of Muncie is actually pretty safe. Especially on/near campus. We do occasionally get texts of nearby gunshots. I don't have data to back this next claim, but unless you're a frequent buyer of highly addictive drugs, they're not of much concern to you.\n\nTldr, it's about as safe as anywhere else",

To show suppression of evidence, you\u2019d need to show a Muncie Police report of a SA incident near campus (sat Frat Row) that would be mysteriously missing from data provided by Ball State.  Or Ball State\u2019s numbers being consistently better than those provided by the Muncie PD for similar area/time frame.  Absent something like that, Id be careful throwing around accusations.  Granted you may have a personal experience that makes you think BSU \u201cmay\u201d be suppressing evidence.  Now go out and prove it.",

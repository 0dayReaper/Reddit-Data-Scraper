My friend and I signed a lease but are no longer able to live there. You do NOT have to be a student to live here! We really need someone in here by September 1! It has a balcony, air conditioning, and on-site laundry. You would be fully responsible for electric, utilities are split between you and the company, which is an additional cost each month (under $50). Here is a link to the property, and an application link for anyone interested :) feel free to dm for more info![Listing and images](https://www.bsurentals.com/listings/detail/853bfec1-e921-4b06-8771-2696eb32c333)\n\nhttps://middletownpg.appfolio.com/listings/rental_applications/new?listable_uid=9051bf61-3efa-418d-a418-4f819afb931e&amp;s",

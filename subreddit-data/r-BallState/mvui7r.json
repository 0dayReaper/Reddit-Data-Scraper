In March I was notified I am on the wait list, was told I\u2019d find out after April 15th. The program I\u2019ve applied to is the dual major MA in Social Psychology and CMHC (counseling). At this point I\u2019m not feeling very optimistic that I\u2019ll be admitted for the fall, but I\u2019m reeeeally hoping there\u2019s still a chance.",

R1 colleges like Purdue were just a far fetched dream as I barely have a year of research experience and am graduating with a 3.4, so not the best for getting into PhD programs! So for me it was masters programs or post-bacc research to make me competitive enough.\n\nTL;DR: I was rejected at 3 masters programs I applied to, and of course at the two ambitious PhD programs at Purdue and IU. After 2 months of being anxious, and literally entering a mental breakdown, I was accepted into BSU\u2019s Clinical Psych MA program 3 days ago!\n\nTL;DR (Again): Don\u2019t loose hope, be patient and things just may work out for you in the end! This admissions cycle has been hard, just keep courage and hope for the best! :)\n\nAnd feel free to connect with me! Glad to see a fellow student applying to grad school in psychology!",

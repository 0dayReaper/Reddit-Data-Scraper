Even when I did from sophomore year on, I only used it a handful of times (outside of going home)\u2026.my bike was great and I lived a good ways off campus my senior year. As mentioned, MITS can get you to Wal-Mart and such, and the Village has stuff you need also.",

There is a bus that passes through campus that goes to Walmart and I think a few other locations. That being said if you want to be off campus in the city OFTEN get a friend who can drive because I don\u2019t think it operates on the weekends. As for going home for breaks i have relatives who pick me up and drop me off and it\u2019s honestly really nice to have that time together before you have to go back to school",

Are the alternatives actually any good? Are there alternative hook options?",

If you need one removed and are worried about it leaving damage, (I think) you can ask an RA and they can do it for you. At the end of the year, don't remove any hooks or pads you don't have to. If you cause the damage you get charged, but if a housing person does it after you move out, you won't get charged.",

The janitorial staff will remove them at move out, they probably use a heat gun or Something. But if you chip some paint Then just go to Lowes and get some more paint and correct it, depending on the age of the dorm it will likely blend in. Just don't do it the day of move out.",

In some space huge chunks would some off.\nI lived there the first year it was open and at they time they told us to only use brand name and then quickly pulled a reverse on that statement when everyone was upset they got charged for the paint peeling off at every turn.",

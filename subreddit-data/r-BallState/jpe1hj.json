There will be a limit of 500 students, and you must reserve your FREE ticket online at ballstatesports.com.  Only 500 and once they are gone, they are gone. \n\nAnd we will be making sure to use appropriate distancing and mask policies to ensure that we can all have fun while still being safe.\n\nWe hope to see you there!

            "comment": "I grew up in Muncie and driving around the non campus areas is generally chill with exception of the main roadways during high volume hours. I knew multiple people who were involved in accidents on or around campus.\n\nI'm of the mindset that the road layout in Muncie is terrible and that's what causes a lot of issues. There are a lot of weird stretchs that funnel to one lane and create race conditions for people driving. It doesn't help that people treat driving like a game but the infrastructure layout in Muncie is suboptimal.\n\nI'm located in Phoenix now, but when I come back to Muncie the driver's all seem like angels to me and I just drive the speed limit.",

On campus it wasn\u2019t too bad but I\u2019ve been gone a long time so I can\u2019t speak to that. But generally drivers would let us cross at designated crosswalks. But the other poster mentioned the poor infrastructure",

But student drivers don\u2019t stop often and speed around when there isn\u2019t much car traffic on roads like McKinley and University, due to this, these drivers are oblivious to pedestrians and don\u2019t stop if someone is crossing the road when there aren\u2019t a lot of cars",

I always tell my dad who works in the grounds department that trees in the medians on McKinley are terrible because you can't see around them.\n\nI know they've floated the idea of shutting down McKinley to campus only vehicles but have never followed through. For on campus pedestrias  that could be a huge safety increase.\n\nI totally agree about McGalliard but it's not just McGalliard, Wheeling at one point was 4 lanes to 2 lane to 4 lanes. Traffic funneled to bethal during football games is 4 lanes to 2. There's so many places like that in mucnie that cause issues. They really need a pedestrian bridge over Tillitson so they don't need to shut down the road on gamedays.\n\nHowever, I think op might be talking about differences in driving demographics and I went a bit off topic with muncies bad road layout.",

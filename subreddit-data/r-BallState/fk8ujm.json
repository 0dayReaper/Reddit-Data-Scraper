    "postText": "Since everything is shutting down/moving online, including tutoring, I could very much do with getting together with someone to help me with my statistics homework. I have talked to some classmates, who are all going home. If anyone would be willing to talk with me further, I would greatly appreciate it. The class is PSY 241, but I do suppose that anyone who is good at math/stats would be helpful to talk to. Thanks!",

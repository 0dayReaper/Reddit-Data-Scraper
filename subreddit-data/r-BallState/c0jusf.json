I'm not one of those people who shoves it down your throat and makes being bi my whole personality, but I feel as though I should be upfront about it. Anyone have any advice/insight into this?",

It\u2019s not like you are going to be asked at the door do you like guys or girls. \n\nI\u2019d encourage you to meet all the fraternities and don\u2019t just settle on the first rush event you go to. At the end of the day, it\u2019s about finding where you feel most comfortable and at home. You might even find out that joining a fraternity isn\u2019t for you.",

            "comment": "In all honesty, it depends on what fraternity you rush. Some chapters have almost no LGBT members, others have a large amount. I highly recommend going to the Meet the Greeks event during the Fall semester to \"meet\" all of the fraternities and see which chapters you are interested in. Don't be afraid to be yourself and if you run into any jerks, you probably won't want to be in their fraternity anyways. Feel free to PM me if you'd like a list of fraternities that are more LGBT friendly at BSU to look out for at Meet the Greeks. If not, then trust the system and have a blast.",

We never made a big deal about it and as far as I know there were no hateful comments towards them. \n\n\nBut like most other people said, try a bunch of fraternities and see what one fits you best I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot more than the one I was in that is accepting.",

When I went through rush years ago, I was dead set on one fraternity until I asked a question regarding hazing. When I couldn\u2019t get a straight answer, I was out. \n\nThe experience will only be whatever you make of it. \n\nI\u2019d also suggest either waiting until spring or your 2nd year before you rush. Actually making friends the old fashioned way, either in classes or in the dorms, was more beneficial to me. The people I\u2019m closest to 20 years later I met in Schmidt/Wilson.",

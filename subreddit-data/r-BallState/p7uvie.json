    "postText": "Hi! I'm a high school senior and I'm looking at universities to apply to but I'm so worried absolutely no one will accept me. I have a 3.5 gpa, but no real extra-curricular activities other than a job I've had since the middle of junior year (mostly due to financial reasons) My biggest worry is i technically dropped out my sophomore year and then returned junior year. So while I'm on track to graduate on time I only have algebra, geometry and algebra 2 math credits. Also I'm taking the SAT this October and based off of my psat scores I should get around a 1200 or plus since I'm doing some hard-core studying. Any thoughts ? and tysm!!",

            "comment": "Your numbers look good, so I think you will do fine. A lot of schools won't look beyond that. The last 2 years have also been difficult for a lot of people, so they don't have the extracurriculars they would normally have or they were doing school online. Apply to a wide variety of schools so you have options.  Since your asking on the Ball state page, Indiana has a lot of different schools. There are the big state schools, as well as small private schools, and the branch campuses. Give some thought to what are looking for in a school. I was surprised when the financial aid from the private school brought the price down to being comparable to a state school. The branch campuses didn't offer as many scholarships. Some majors may be harder to get into, but once you are accepted to the university, you can attend and reapply to the major.",

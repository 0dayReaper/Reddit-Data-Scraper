I emailed 3 days ago and haven't heard back. This is frustrating because some of the assignments are blank, and I don't want to fail my final semester of school because of a blow off Fine Arts credit. I might contact someone above them soon if I can't get ahold of anyone by end of day Monday.",

There may be a GA listed as well that you could contact.",

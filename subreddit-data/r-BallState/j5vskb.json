You would need to travel at least a mile from the edge of campus before you got into any sketchy areas and even then, it's just Muncie. Muncie is statistically safer than a lot of cities(big and small) in Indiana. Also, the campus police are one of the two Indiana campus law enforcement agencies accredited by CALEA.",

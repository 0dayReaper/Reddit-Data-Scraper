Under these extraordinary circumstances, we will provide grading alternatives for the current academic semester by extending the deadlines and availability of the credit/no credit option.  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This is a very complicated issue, and I assure you that we are considering all options and their implications. Whether or not a student should take a course credit/no credit depends on many important factors, including academic standing, financial aid, and certain licensure requirements.  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Our top priority is that all students make the right decision for their long-term academic and professional success. Therefore, we will provide enhanced advising and financial aid counseling for students who wish to explore taking one or more of their current courses credit/no credit.  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I understand you may have questions about how the credit/no credit option affects you as we work through these issues. In seven to 10 days, we will email you with additional information and post it on the University COVID-19 website, [**bsu.edu/coronavirus**](https://nam05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fg1g1rb%2F0gamqp%2Fo3vsre&amp;data=02%7C01%7Csplantenga%40bsu.edu%7Ca94d17822f6043ad61b108d7d4aeb3a3%7C6fff909f07dc40da9e30fd7549c0f494%7C0%7C0%7C637211719111763068&amp;sdata=aDKRWoLOTrwsJe6qS4W2grEq5T0S02MK5SwwpOnuOgg%3D&amp;reserved=0), and the Office of the Registrar website, [**bsu.edu/registrar**](https://nam05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.e2ma.net%2Fclick%2Fg1g1rb%2F0gamqp%2F4vwsre&amp;data=02%7C01%7Csplantenga%40bsu.edu%7Ca94d17822f6043ad61b108d7d4aeb3a3%7C6fff909f07dc40da9e30fd7549c0f494%7C0%7C0%7C637211719111773056&amp;sdata=1EIuWpZfCPZG5MRezL4QG%2Fwfe6pGxZzxgDmjrMloQRw%3D&amp;reserved=0).  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I thank you for your creative thinking and flexibility during this time of disruption and for your continued dedication to teaching and learning. I am confident we can effectively address these challenges together.  \n\n\nSincerely,\n\nSusana Rivera-Mills  \nProvost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs  \nBall State University",

I've been told that taking a class for no credit is like withdrawing from the class. \n\nKinda annoying that they make this statement and proceed to not explain it at all. They also could've just used pass/no pass lingo like every other school, but  it makes me nervous since they're calling it something else.",

(Though, I'd wait for their next email since they may change their policy about what credit/no credit means this semester).\n\nMy dad went to Purdue in the seventies and they called it pass/fail back then and they call it pass/not pass now. Just a bunch of names for the same thing.",

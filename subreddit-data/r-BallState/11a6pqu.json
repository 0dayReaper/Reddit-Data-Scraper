I applied for the Indy 500 internship when I was a senior and didn\u2019t even get a rejection letter. So you getting an interview is very positive. Give it your all.",

I found I could \"I'm an intern\" my way into some really unique experiences that I'll remember forever. Internships are great experience no matter how closely to graduation and provide practice of valuable communication skills that many employers look for. Plus, if you think you would like it, do it! Totally worth having some fun",

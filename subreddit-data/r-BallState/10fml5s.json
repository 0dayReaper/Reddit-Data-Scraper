From what I've heard, Muncie and the surrounding areas tend to be a bit more conservative. Any input on this topic would be helpful, thanks!",

Everybody at the school itself is super accepting and friendly. I\u2019m a senior and haven\u2019t had a single bad experience with staff or peers.",

Ball State also offers inclusive excellence training for employees, which among other things includes gender identity and sexual orientation diversity. Employees can also take part in the Safe Zone and Trans+ Safe Zone trainings. There are also a good amount of employees who are proudly a part of the queer community. Indiana and Delaware County are more conservative areas, but Ball State itself is more liberal. I can\u2019t personally speak to how thriving the queer community is within Muncie, but Ball State is generally accepting.",

There\u2019s always a chance of negative experiences, so be aware and prepared, but that\u2019s Indiana and life. Spectrum is the LGBT organization on campus, I\u2019ve never been to events, but I\u2019ve heard good things. We will welcome you with open arms.",

Ball State is very TOLERANT of differences and also provides students Safe Spaces. I was never a part of these groups but every time I walked through the atrium they were definitely giving out info pamphlets about their group. \n\nIn terms of Muncie being conservative, I have to disagree. I remember campaigning door to door and a lot of Muncie residents vote Democrat and are very Liberal. (Most College campuses are liberal). So you should be fine.",

There's a handful of pride and acceptance clubs, as well as the multicultural center where you could find some more information about that stuff in the future.\n\nThe professors themselves tend to be very inclusive and many progressive, but there's always bad apples in an orchard.\n\nI do warn that there tends to be a lot of groups of different churches, organizations, and such that tend to advertise their beliefs occasionally on campus. But that's usually stuff you can easily ignore and bypass.",

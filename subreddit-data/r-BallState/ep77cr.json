Able to get you in quick, prices are great and if they can't do anything they'll let you know with no charge and recommend someone who can.\n\nSeriously, the worst part of graduating was having to find a new mechanic.",

Both usually have someone to drive you back and forth if necessary. Midas overcharges and is a bit sketchy but has also done alright. I don't know if I'd ever go back there now that I found better places.",

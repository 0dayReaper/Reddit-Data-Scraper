It was very spooky, but we want to visit more locations like this!\n\nAnyone know any haunted locations nearby? Even a place that's just creepy would be awesome, any suggestions welcome!",

I\u2019m actually friends with the people who lease the house now, and they say they\u2019ve been a little spooked by some of the sounds, but they mostly ignore it.

I haven\u2019t reached out in a month or so, though. \n\nMy brother is a BSU student and is actually leasing out the same house in August 2020, so I\u2019m sure there will be more stories to share. I do really love the home itself, and I plan to have a throwback party after he moves in. I hope it\u2019s not a mistake to go back!",

Frog baby access is within the landscaping, and apparently the network spreads throughout the campus, with access points hidden both outside and inside college buildings.  Ask around those one who graduated in the 80\u2019s-90\u2019s, as the tunnels were popular for those who studied other things than were offered in the class catalogue:)",

My friend and I were feeling a little ballsy so we got out of our car and started to walk toward it and it started glowing red and got bigger before randomly disappearing. We had at least 8 people who witnessed this too (we took two cars). It was pretty cool. At the same time, the light seemed very far way above the horizon line of the cornfields at night, so it wasn't like the light is in walking distance. \n\nNext time we go, we are going to walk toward it again. Apparently there's a driveway that is too rough and broken to take a car on that we think is suppose to be Moody's house halfway down the road, so we are going to walk up that and investigate.",

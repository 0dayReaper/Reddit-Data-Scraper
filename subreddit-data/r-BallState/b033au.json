    "postText": "Hi there. I'm seeking a roommate for my 2BR apartment south of campus. Rent is $525/Mo for the unit or $262.50 each. Utilities range $150-200/mo total or $75-100 each. Looking for someone ASAP and the lease runs until November, but we can work out a deal if you want to move out before then. Also you could re-sign the lease if you want to stay longer. I have photos and a longer more detailed listing on CL and Facebook. If interested, message me!",

Upgrading the BIOS may require a different CPU that is supported by older BIOS revisions.\"",

Will need to know what your current components are, why you want to upgrade, etc.\n\nNeed to make sure your RAM is compatible with the motherboard and CPU you want to get. That's probably the main thing you need to worry about if you're not getting new RAM.",

Before they moved to the library they could, but then after that, the management team didn't want the liability of opening up laptops / desktops and doing more complex work. \n\nThere is a hardware team but I'm not sure if they'd help with something like that since they generally just do repairs. Doesn't hurt to ask though if you want to go that route.",

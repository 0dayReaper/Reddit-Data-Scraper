Yeah, maybe it\u2019s not handled the best, but it\u2019s a crisis and nothing in a crisis is handled well in any crisis. Im sick of every post on this subreddit being \u201cthis school is unsafe and sucks\u201d or \u201cwhen do are we gonna get sent home? Two or three weeks?\u201d Focus on doing your part of staying safe if you want the school to be safer.",

And for the 14 day quarantine all you had to do is say \"Yup I quarantined and checked for symptoms everyday\", without any proof. And for anyone off campus they just said, \"We recommend getting a test/quarantining.\" That's a big difference from the schools that made everyone get a test.\n\nAnd no I don't want to run a school of 22 thousand people, but obviously our current administration should have went into different careers because they can't run this place either.",

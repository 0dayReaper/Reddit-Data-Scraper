    "postText": "i feel ridiculous asking this to start off. i'm just now returning to the bsu campus in my senior year after spending the last two and a half years doing online\nclasses. originally i was going to commute 45-60 minutes to muncie but after one test drive up i\u2019m regretting it and i really need to move somewhere on or near campus ASAP. during my freshman year i didn't really\nget an opportunity to seek new friends and the few i did have either dropped out or found someone to move in with so i\u2019m getting desperate. i\u2019ve been trying to see how many flyers around campus i can find searching for roommates and getting in contact but have had no luck so far. does anyone have any suggestions or really anything that might help? anything is appreciated. i\u2019ve made an account on roomsurf and have found some people who made accounts a while ago so i have no idea if they\u2019re still looking for roommates or even check the website at all. if i have to rent out a place for myself i\u2019ll do it but it\u2019s not ideal and i\u2019d prefer splitting rent and living with other people if i can",

I feel if I had been taught better foundational skills in high school (or taken more lower-level classes with the minor) I'd be right there with them. \n\nStudying in school definitely helped my conversational skills. I came fron a high school where we spoke hardly ANY spanish even in college level courses. Of the classes I've taken, only one felt really pointless, though all the profs I've had have been great. If you can get in one with Marina, you're in for a good time.",

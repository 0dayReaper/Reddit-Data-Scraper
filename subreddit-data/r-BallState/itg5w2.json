My girlfriend, Bridget, and I started this club as a way to meet new people while having fun playing pickleball. We'll get you caught up on the rules and all the equipment will be provided. Bring friends if you'd like!\n\n##### Why Should I Join?\n\n* You'll meet new friends\n* It's casual and laid back w/ opportunities for more competitive play (tournaments) if you choose :)\n* It's a great exercise!\n* The bus route leads right to the tennis courts\n\n##### Wednesdays at 6pm Doesn't Work For You?\n\nNo worries! Once we all see how many ends up joining the GroupMe, then we're gonna take a vote for a day and time that fits best w/ everyone's schedules.

            "comment": "I have my MA from an aligned dept. I maintained a 3.8+ GPA which is pretty bog standard in grad school. Everyone gets good grades or they drop out in the first semester. Basically the rule is, for ever credit hour you take, that's 7 hours of study/work per week. So 12 CH's = 4 classes = 84 hrs of study. Then add in class time (4\\*2) = 8, sleep (8\\*7)=56, and research (\\~20hrs). In your case you'll have practicum so that's your 20 hours.  \n\n\nThere are 168 hours in a week so your hours in terms of what remains after each activity:\n\nClass = 160 hours left  \nStudy = 76 hours left  \nSleep = 20 hours left  \nPracticum / research = 0 hours left  \n\n\nYou maximize your time by studying efficiently with your cohort.",

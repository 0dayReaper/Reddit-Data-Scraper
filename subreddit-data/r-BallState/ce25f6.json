    "postText": "I'm in my late 30's, hold an associates degree in business admin, and am hoping to get into the computer science program this fall.  My gpa from the associates is 3.41 (from a regionally accredited school, out of state) and I requested transcripts to be sent yesterday to the university.  I also applied yesterday for admission.  How likely does everyone think it is that:\n\n1.)  I'll be accepted, period, without submitting SAT, ACT (I know it's optional and because I never took them)?\n\n2.)  it is too late for fall enrollment?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see they prefer those who have contributed to the community in some way or another.  I'm just your average citizen who has worked for the past several years and am hoping to advance my degree/career.  FWIW, I'm a 5yr veteran of the Marine Corps.  Will that honestly even make a difference?  I'm also a local resident of Muncie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's pretty exciting but I have a feeling that I missed the chance for this fall.",

You can still register through the end of the first week of classes (first week is the week of Aug 17 I think). You may not get the classes you want but you should at least get something. Good luck!",

Granted I applied for Spring 2020, but the teacher\u2019s college has been amazing at replying to any emails I send! I\u2019d suggest emailing admissions@bsu.edu or your program director. Admissions has generally replied within 24 hours and my program director has generally replied same day.",

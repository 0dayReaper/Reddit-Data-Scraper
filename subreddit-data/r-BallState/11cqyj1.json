    "postText": "After graduating with an undergraduate degree in the humanities last spring and moving an hour away to pursue my dream of teaching middle school, I've realized that a) teaching is not for me and b) my heart is still in Muncie. Finding a job at the university seems like the best bet for securing employment in the area, so I'm currently looking at/planning to apply to some academic advising jobs and entry level positions at the library. Given my background, I'd also jump if Indiana Academy started hiring Student Life Counselors again.\n\nIf anyone has been hired in these (or related) areas, can you tell me what the process looked like for you? Any advice or insider tips?",

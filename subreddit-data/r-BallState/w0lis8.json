    "postText": "This was something I\u2019ve been wondering for a while since Degreeworks isn\u2019t saying anything about it, but what would the passing grade for MATH125 be for a music major? I know some classes have a minimum of D- while others a C but I\u2019m just not sure which of the two apply for that class",

The major in music for BA/BS doesn\u2019t have a listed grade requirement and neither does the UCC for this one. D- would apply here.

Also, don't be afraid to ask your advisor these questions! They will email you back with helpful info.",

    "postText": "As the title says, I saw the new Esports bachelors and was shocked BSU would offer it. For background I just graduated with a STEM degree so I already know I have some funky bias. I obviously could never do an arts/theater/etc degree but I respect them and understand the purpose/experience of learning around other artists. \n\nBut this bachelors seems like an absolute joke and robbery for anyone gullible enough to fall for a way too specific TCOM pseudo major. To me the market just isn\u2019t there and even if you do complete the bachelors, what are you going to do, announce a local Smash tournament for a $250 payout if that? \n\nI mean events that pull thousands, potentially millions like the Dota 2 International and Hearthstone Grandmasters only have like what, 5-8 announcers? But those tournaments already have big and established names that I assume won\u2019t leave because they\u2019ve already made it and are making stable money. \n\nWould anyone genuinely spend four years for this major as opposed to just going TCOM or journalism?",

There\u2019s interest among many young people trying to go into professional esports, but the idea of an esports degree in 2021 sounds about as reasonable as a Jazz degree in 1921 \u2014 degrees and education is just not how that industry works, whatsoever. There are many parts of the Esports industry that are unique to it and are multi-faceted, such as coaching, tech work, logistics, management, and so on, but nobody in the industry now employs based on degrees, and one degree couldn\u2019t possibly cover all of those roles with the level of quality of their respective specialized degree programs. This degree just seems like an easy cash grab for the university, and if it flops then you just fire the professors and move on.",

I mean honestly the fact they removed the testing lab for a Esports room was extremely odd to me and that\u2019s coming from someone who hated the testing lab. It\u2019s also extremely insulting to teaching majors who have to put their own money into supplies or social work majors who have to usually take an unpaid full time capstone, plus who knows how many other majors in similar circumstances.",

They raise money by offering programs like this. It's one of the reasons Dr. Ferguson didn't last long. The board is focused on money and hiring \"favored candidates\" over who the best person is for the job, and that clash led to him resigning. \n\nIf you take that into consideration, it's no wonder that shit like this makes it in.",

Like in the real world, people are not going to get performance jobs with just classical music.  Vocal Jazz and commercial music are literally more practical because it is the stuff that is more mainstream.  I'd think the vocal music department would teach multiple styles and teach their students how to adapt.",

It\u2019s the same way with esports. You need to know all about the history of gaming and know all the technicalities of video production and streaming, which is something you can learn on your own but being in a specific course plan and environment sure helps a lot for people who can afford it. You get to interact with people with the same interests as you and get the specific connections you need to break into the industry, taught by professors with the specific experience you need to learn from.\n\nI\u2019m sorry all your efforts to bring more specific vocal programs have been shot down by the school. I think those would be really cool to be offered at Ball State. But realistically, esports is a more booming industry and has more interest which is why we were able to get support from the school to make the program a reality.",

They just care that they have a bachelors degree. \n\nThere are more degrees earned than jobs available in most very specific fields. It\u2019s no different than a degree in Medieval Literature or Dance. Not everyone will work in literature or become a professional dancer. But a bachelors degree is still a bachelors degree. \n\nAnd even then, the degree is only to get your foot in the door. After your first job, experience far outweighs education when it comes to getting hired.",

Broader is always better no matter the degree and I feel like this one focuses on one of the most niche markets, I can\u2019t see how this bachelors would give you a fighting chance in any other career if up against other bachelor degrees. \n\nAll in all I\u2019m just stumped on why someone would get this over a TCOM major, I always imagined anyone wanting to be an announcer would just go for that. \n\nAlso while I don\u2019t like the bachelors, I think it\u2019s introduced some *potential* great classes, the most unique being history of gaming! I think this could be a really unique class IF it was about cultural influence of gaming, say for example DND and Magic the Gathering being used as fuel during the satanic panic. Gaming is a major part of our society, up brining, and daily lives and I think there\u2019s a potential for scholarly discussion on the subject. \n\nThanks too for the input, I hope I don\u2019t shame any potential esports majors, just love to hear some reasons why others think it\u2019s viable and worth the debt.",

While you and many others may feel like it\u2019s silly and unnecessary, it is something the student esports community has been campaigning hard for at Ball State. There is a lot more that goes into esports than you may think. There is a specific kind of production that goes into it so it makes sense as a concentration in TCOM. It is still a TCOM degree just with that specific focus. \n\nAs a whole esports is not respected as a career and the fact that Ball State has chosen to invest money in the program is incredible, especially with the new esports center dedicated to our program which also is open for students to use to game casually, which is nice if you can\u2019t afford your own equipment or bring it to college.  As of right now, I can say that our school has some of the best administrative support and one of the best teams in the country. \n\nI am an arts major so I know what it feels like to be constantly disrespected and looked down on for my career choice. If you feel like this major is taking away funding from other potentially great majors I can understand that, but there\u2019s no need to be condescending towards people who are genuinely passionate about esports. I think the program has incredible potential.",

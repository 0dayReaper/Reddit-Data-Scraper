    "postText": "Hello!! So for a few years now (this year is my junior year) I've thought of renting somewhere off campus with a few pals, but having had few years to ponder this, ive had time to grow a bit and realize the essential thing of \"living with someone is different than being friends with someone\" which is very true. That being said, I'm making sure that whoever I live with, we each have our own separate rooms/spaces to be alone &amp; to ourselves.\nI'm also a newbie to the whole renting ordeal of being an adult, even though I'm 22, almost 23. That being said, anyone have any advice on how to find decent paying jobs to pay bills w in the area (I already have phone &amp; car bills so I know bills well, just want a job that pays more bc more bills) and any other advice?? I know to avoid BSU rentals bc old friend used to rent through them.",

I would recommend scheduling your classes carefully just so if/when you get a job you have a solid availability you can show to an employer for either mornings, afternoons, or evenings!",

It was right off campus on the north side, on Oakwood Ave. Solid location with BSU bus stops nearby (at least back then).\n\nI lived at the Scheidler apartments that are owned by Ball State my last year and a half there and honestly loved that even more.",

            "comment": "To be perfectly honest, I think the best method for looking for rentals is going through a small business homeowner. Places like BSU Rentals/Middletown Propertjes group, and even apartment complexes like haven, silvertree, etc. all have dumb rules and stipulations that really shouldn\u2019t exist. I rent through a private owner of a house and I pay $600 a month, and he\u2019s very genuine, wants to keep the apartment in working order, and is a very kind person. So honestly, look for smaller, private owned businesses (lots of signs all over the place in Muncie) and try going with them.",

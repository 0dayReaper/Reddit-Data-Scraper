    "postText": "I have a gorgeous/large one bedroom available the first of November. Original hardwood floors, lots of light, security cameras, washer/dryer hookup. It\u2019s really nice and in a quiet part in the old West end. Super close to Ball State and downtown. $500 plus electric but that\u2019s cheap since I pay gas and it\u2019s gas heat. I will do a six month lease, and dogs are acceptable at no extra charge(just have bet records). I\u2019m not a slumlord and take really good care of my property. Y\u2019all message me if you\u2019re interested!",

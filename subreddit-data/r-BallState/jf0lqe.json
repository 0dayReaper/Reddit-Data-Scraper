My roommate and I got drunk on a Sunday and took the neighbors VHS recorder(which at that time was $$$) and walked to the   neighbors houses and I filmed my roommate basically pushing his way in the door and filmed him jumping on their beds, checking the water pressure in their sinks, making sure their doors locked all the way, seeing if their silverware had stains, and on and on.  We never got kicked out of anyone's house.  It was amazing and I wish I had that tape.  Next year we moved to the old church that was on the corner of Riverside and New York.  And that was a blast because of all the girls that walked to the Frats and got invited into our apartment!  Kids, enjoy your time at BSU.  Have fun and do it right.",

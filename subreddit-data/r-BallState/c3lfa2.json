Doesn\u2019t sound like much, but each print is like 10 cents or something like that. I\u2019ve only met a couple of students who used all of their printing money and they were music majors. \n\nAlso the computer labs in the dorms don\u2019t count prints so you\u2019re grand.",

Just don\u2019t try to print in the library during peak hours, it\u2019s hell. If you need to print in color the library has a color printer (or get an architecture friend to print in their building, I heard they had a more easily accessible one).",

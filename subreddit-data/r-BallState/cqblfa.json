First time they had him on a Thursday he didn't go on until midnight, last year I think he was just finishing up by around 1130ish\n\nLast year I think he ended up doing a bit of a short set, I caught the tail end but a few people said he sat down and told jokes for a while. \n\nI would just probably get there around 930-10, you may have to watch some openers but fuck it, support local music and all thay",

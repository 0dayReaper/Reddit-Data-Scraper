It's gone now but I know for a while they wanted to do a cat cafe but the plan fell through and nothing came of it.  Now the area they planned to use is the smoke shop I think.  Can't remember what was right next to it off the top of my head.  I was told one of the reasons why the village is dying so much is because the parking situation really stinks but because I always walked to it I can't really vouch for that.  I know there was some type of music festival in the village last year so it seems like they're trying but with not much down there it's kinda eh.  I think nowadays the only time I go to the village is when I need the atm since so little is down there.  \n\n\nOutside of the village I wish BSU was more involved with student organizations but that's already been said.  Outside of the activity fair it just seems like they don't do a good job of engaging with them.",

It\u2019s a shame that any business plan that gets put forward in the village usually fails or doesn\u2019t last longer than 6 months.",

But Don't loose hope for the lack of concerts. The Sauna is a house venue near campus and it's hosted and ran by students. They have great Indie rock, punk rock, and a little bit of everything else coming through and playing. They bring bands from across the region so it's definitely worth checking out this semester. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the social scene would be a lot better IMO if Muncie and Ball State could find a way to be more included with each other but the social stigmas hold high for some reason.",

During the winter of my 4th year there about half of the bars in The Village closed down leaving us with The Chug, Scotty's, and that other sports bar whose name escapes me. The place on the corner that I think is a hookah bar or something now used to be The Locker Room, which was my personal favorite bar on that strip. It had character, wasn't sticky like The Chug, but was still your typical college bar. And it was cheap. But back then you could bar hop, go to like 7 different bars in a night, have a good time at all of them, and not spend too much money. Nowadays you just have that lame excuse for a \"village\" they have now. I wish future generations could have the experience I had. \n\nAlso I heard Neely street isn't the slop-fest it used to be. Man I had such a good time on Neely. Neelyfest was a great time. So many bad decisions.",

Bevi's kinda just disappeared overnight.  I wish they used more of the area but if businesses cosntantly go belly-up out of the blue like that it probably doesn't make sense to set up business in the village for a lot of people so they go to other college towns or elsewhere in Muncie.",

For example they have a rural research division that is working to help smaller nearby communities like Bedford boost their economies. Ball State should do more to help Muncie imo.",

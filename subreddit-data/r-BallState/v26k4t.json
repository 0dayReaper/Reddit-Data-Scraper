The decoy clearly announces they are \"underage\" to see if the match will do the right thing and stop communication or continue. \n\n\nIf they continue, the conversation usually turns sexual by the match with the decoy playing along up to agreeing to meet up. \n\n\nOnce the meet up is arranged a group of members from PCM/PCI will record the meetup live on Facebook or YouTube.\n\n\nOuting the subject as a Predator. Interviewing and discussing the interactions.\n\n\nAll info is then turned into local PD with varying degrees of success regarding actual arrests or prosecution.",

He asked at least 100 times about what he could do to prevent being exposed. He initiated sexual plans with the child including acts such as \"swapping head\" as he calls it \n\nHe made plans to meet with a male-to-female transgender child for sex. Then he fully followed through on those plans by going to the meetup location, excitedly looking for the child. That's when this video starts- predator catchers Indiana confronts him.",

It is criminal and he should be arrested. If he was anyone else would he have been arrested? \nIf he was trying to meet my child/family I would push for arrest. However, thank God it was just decoys outing  him. Very sad for his girlfriend/family that his criminal actions affect them",

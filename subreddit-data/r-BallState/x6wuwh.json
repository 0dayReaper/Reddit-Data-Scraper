Most do not have working lights any more, but those that do have ancient fluorescents that make you want to vomit. Overall, 3/10. Nowhere near as good as Purdue\u2019s.",

Don't cause any damage, don't steal anything, and leave no evidence that anyone was there (except for maybe some tasteful graffiti). If you can't access an area without breaking something (like a lock or a window) then either come up with a more clever plan or turn around.",

From my experience, all that stuff Phantom-Watson says is correct.  In those days, I don't think the tunnels were old enough that we had the mineral formations, but I remember that we could hear conversation from above in the tunnels under Noyer and you could hear and see lights from the traffic above as you went down the tunnels next to McKinley. I regret not leaving any graffiti, but there was a ton of it down there.  Keep in mind my experience is from forty years ago, so I have no idea what they're like now.",

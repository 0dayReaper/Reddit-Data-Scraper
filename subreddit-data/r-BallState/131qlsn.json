    "postText": "Does anyone know what the extremely slippery substance on the road and sidewalk was on campus?  I was in town to see Nate Bargatze at Emens, and it would have been at a pretty busy intersection that was about 1/2 mile north.  I thought that it had rained, but realized that it was some type of oil.   Cars and people were slipping because of it.  I also thought that it was weird, as it wasn't just on the road, there were puddles of it on the sidewalk next to that intersection as well.",

I\u2019m a bit nervous since I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be the oldest student in my classes but I am very excited. I\u2019m gettin my BS in accounting. Any other older students planning to attend in the fall? Any commuters? I live in Anderson, happy to car pool if able. I have classes on campus Monday, Wednesday and Friday.",

Even as an undergraduate most of us didn\u2019t mind older students and as a grad student there were more than a few \u201colder\u201d students. Not sure on the other stuff but I can tell you not to worry about being the \u201cold person\u201d bc most college aged kids don\u2019t really care too much\u2026.in fact I saw them as a good thing bc they had life experiences I didn\u2019t have yet.",

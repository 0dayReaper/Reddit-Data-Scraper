I think it\u2019s either just the shit internet or maybe it\u2019s the router in our room. Honestly, it could be both. Has anyone else been having this problem or is it just us?",

            "comment": "Well for starters, you can\u2019t have a router in the dorms. You don\u2019t need one, and it messes with the already shitty bandwidth. Secondly, if I remember correctly, there\u2019s a certain method you have to use to connect your system to the internet. Talk to your RA, they can give you more information. And get rid of your router.\n\nhttps://bsu.service-now.com/helpdesk?sys_kb_id=c5cb30aedbe6fa00704c38ff9d9619e6&amp;id=kb_article_view&amp;sysparm_rank=15&amp;sysparm_tsqueryId=47bc76661b82e890d5012fc4bd4bcbf3\n\nThis tells you how to register your console",

I assume that there is an issue with the router in the dorm itself, neither of us brought one. Bsuguest is straight up not even on the list of available WiFi networks. Sorry if I was misleading or confusing in my wording.",

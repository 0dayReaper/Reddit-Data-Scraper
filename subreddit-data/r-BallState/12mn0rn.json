I saw online that you got them at the beginning of this year an I just wanted to see what the perspective of another school is on them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you like them?\n\nDo students use them?\n\nDo they deliver anything from off campus / non-campus run dining?\n\nDo they run at night?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny other information you think makes sense.",

            "comment": "Love them! Yes, people use them. They have slowly added more options (just added Starbucks coffee).  I think they run the hours of the restaurants but not sure. They have on campus dining halls and on campus restaurants (Papa John\u2019s for example). They are impacted by volume so something\u2019s it takes longer than other times, but we love them. Also, if they get stuck, it\u2019s interesting to watch how they can get themselves unstuck. I put a pin in the wrong location and it hopped a curb and was going up a hill and managed to correct itself which was hilarious to watch. I hope you enjoy them.",

I like them and I think they\u2019re cute. It\u2019s interesting to see them driving around campus. Students use them all the time. Meal swipes and dining plus (which is like extra dining money you have that\u2019s connected to your meal plan) are able to be used with the robots. They stop running when the dining halls close",

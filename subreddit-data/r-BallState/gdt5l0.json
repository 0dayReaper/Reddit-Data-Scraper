There are cheaper options, but you get what you pay for. This location is very close to campus and is a very standard apartment that isn\u2019t trashy. **Muncie is very trashy** \n\nI would refrain from renting a house for your first year unless you are looking to save money by having roommates. The houses are typically trash and landlords are hard to deal with. \n\nSammie, the 400 apartments landlord, is incredible. She makes everything easy and is very lenient on rent deposits and rent payments. Give her a call  (765) 729-1244\n\nDM me if you have any more questions.",

They don't have every amenity known to man but you have Ball State as your landlord, they're very responsive to issues. You have all utilities included in your rent (tv, internet, electric). Lived in them 4 years and it was terrific.\n\nEdit: Stayed in Anthony (north side of campus) for 4 years, loved it. Anthony is on campus but a ways from the dorms. It is totally walk-able and right next to a bus stop, but I'd recommend a bike as it is probably the best way to get around campus.\n\nThe other complex is Schiedler, which is mostly townhouses. The real drawback is they aren't on campus and if you missed the last bus back it is a long walk off campus and crosses couple busy roads. Most people get along fine w/ just the bus, but French grad student used a scooter (and it worked out great for him).",

You pay all your rent and bills online. Liability insurance is required. I pay $450 plus utilities for a \"1 bedroom\" that actually has a second room, but they're raising it to $500 next year (or they would be, if anyone rented it..). It's also the upstairs unit in a converted house. It's walkable to campus in 15-20 minutes.\n\nI visited and toured apartments, but they rented the one I was in the process of applying for after I had left. An employee (every one I've met has been a student) FaceTimed me a tour of the unit I ended up in. \n\nThey've been totally fine to deal with. The bill pay is a little annoying, because it won't notify you when they are posted. The apartment is janky, but honestly I mostly ignore it. Beware if you go to them, they do use tons of tactics that create a sense of emergency to make you think you have to sign now.\n\nI signed with bsuvillagerentals for next year, and I'll pay $400 and be closer to campus. It's another unit (nicer) in a converted house. Rent is payable in person to the property managers near campus. So far, I recommend them, but they have limited property.\n\nSchiedler seems pretty good, but I didn't want to pay that much. I also chose to not have internet at home or a parking pass, so I'm really limited, but campus is close, walking is good, and there is a lot around.\n\nThere is also so much trash around this town! Just tons of litter that blows in constantly.",

The inside was covered in mold and it was a pain in the ass to get out of the lease despite it not being in livable conditions. So always be very careful if you are not doing the university owned apartments. Avoid Orchard apartments and really anything owned by consolidated property management too.",

I spent one year in a privately owned townhome, then spent 4 years living at Sugarbush (LOVED IT), another four years as a homeowner, and now I live in a loft downtown which I absolutely love. My biggest pet peeve is that there are absolutely phenomenal, cool lofts scattered around downtown Muncie above various restaurants and shops, and you seriously can't find out shit about them online.  If you can find one and that's your style, great!  Otherwise I highly recommend Sugarbush, I loved living there, had only one issue with my upstairs neighbor and they handled it immediately, and were prompt about maintenance requests. It was important to me to find a \"non-college\" place to live as a young professional, and Sugarbush fit the bill; it is mostly graduate students, young professionals, or young families.",

Windsong is by commuter lot, Liden Place is the \u201ctop tier\u201d closer to classes and by Beacon Hill. The links should be correct and safe but to be extra safe I would always google the website yourself rather than follow my links. If you have any questions about my lengthy post PM me I should respond within a couple of days.)\n\nSomeone may have listed this already, but /SilverTree/ isn\u2019t half bad, they have 2 and 3 bedroom options and you are on separate leases from your roommates. In the three bedroom option there is a master bedroom which is an extra $25 a month. There are multiple locations for there apartments and the \u201ctop tier\u201d one is 350-375 (all utilities other than electric) if I remember, depending on if you are the master bedroom. It is right off of campus, walking distance to classes. I\u2019m staying in the more mid tier one which is 300-325.\n\nI\u2019ve heard /Beacon Hill/ is nice, right off campus but a bit more pricey (but also apparently nicer and I think some of them may come with free wifi). \n\n/Applegate/ seems pretty but is quite pricey, I seem to remember them saying they charge a $65 fee every month ontop of rent, could be wrong. \n\nI\u2019ve also heard decent things about /Sugarbush/. \n\nI used the /x/ to make it easier to see names. I should mention I am not local to Muncie and I am still learning the area, but these are the apartments I have heard of the most in good ways. A lot of students do /Beacon Hill/ and /SilverTree/.\n\nUniversity apartments are the cheapest you will get but very small.\n\n[Silver Tree](https://silvertreecommunities.com/) [Beacon Hill](https://www.beaconhillmuncie.com/beacon-hill-muncie-in/floorplans) \n[AppleGate](https://www.applegatemunciebyelon.com/floorplans.aspx) \n[SugarBush](https://www.sugarbushapts.com/vacancies)",

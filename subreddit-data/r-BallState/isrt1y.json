It can be very challenging, but overall I\u2019d recommend it.\n\nAlso as the other person said if you don\u2019t enjoy it it is very easy to switch majors within the business college and not be behind",

From experience, I transferred from Chemistry into Accounting and Finance, and it was such an easy transition. As others said, many professors will help because they want you to succeed, like most professors. \n\nThough, be careful with your prereqs, ACC201 and ACC202, because it was waaaay too easy and does not prepare you well enough for your 300 classes. The reason being is that the professors don't want to go into much detail and challenge you as much because those taking the class aren't all accounting majors.",

Literally got my internship and job offer thanks to connections a professor helped me make.  The 300 level classes are a huge jump though.  I saw a lot of people struggle in 302 especially.",

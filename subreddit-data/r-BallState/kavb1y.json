Someone already said but Python is a fantastic choice, if you want to learn something with tons of resources, learn web development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), it\u2019s a fantastic skill to have and one that can easily make you money if you have the right connections (\u201cHey so and so, I saw you don\u2019t have a website and I was wondering if I could offer my services....\u201d). \n\nI wish I could give investing advice, if anyone else has suggestions tag me, I got a sweet sweet two stocks in AMC so fingers crossed that makes a comeback",

I graduated a couple of years ago now so most of that knowledge is gone, do you have a starting point you would recommend for web dev learning?",

Web development is luckily one of the easier branches of Computer Science to get into as it allows a lot more creativity and less math/theory. \n\nThere are millions of resources, tutorials, YouTubers, and free classes to get into web dev, I personally started by just making a simple portfolio site which allowed me to slowly learn new skills and get comfortable with hosting and domain stuff. \n\nFreeCodeCamp is fantastic and gives you lots of work to show by the end and W3Schools is great for looking up specific things and components you may want. \n\nI could go on for ages about what to learn but start slow and stick with HTML and CSS first, this is the core of web development and is a lot easier to grasp, if you get comfortable with those you can begin to use JavaScript to bring life to your websites but don\u2019t try and do too much at one time, it\u2019ll save you in the long run!\n\nIf you or anyone else ever have any questions about coding, I\u2019m always extremely excited to help out!",

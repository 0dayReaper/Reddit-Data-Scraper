Eventually I ended it and he continued to contact me after I blocked his number. In one instance he turned his car around and parked and talked to me for over 15 minutes while I tried to get away. He also constantly asked me about a new partner I was seeing. He apparently saw me walking with him one day.\n\nLol: this was at BSU. Thanks for the downvotes",

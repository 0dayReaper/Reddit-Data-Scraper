    "postText": "Did anybody see someone carrying a bike away from Robert Bell?  It was mostly black with red stripes on the wheels.  Unless they got the lock off, they would have to be carrying it because it had a sprocket lock.The theft happened between 11:36 AM - 3 PM on Saturday the 12th of October.  \nPlease let me know if you know anything!",

I was just admitted and haven\u2019t accepted due to the fear of not being able to pay. I\u2019m not the smartest so merit scholarships won\u2019t help. Can any students or alumni give me an estimated amount?",

            "comment": "So the nice thing about the school is if you take 12 or more credit hours the charge you the same. For this this semester I took 17 credits.\nHere\u2019s the list of what they sent me for the bill. \n\n12-18 Credit hours fee was 4,069\nTuition student service fee 672.00\nAll other dumb ass fees       470\nFor a total of  - 5,211 \nSo for the year I\u2019m looking at 10,422\n\nNow I\u2019m a transfer student this year and only spending two years here. I also live in the apartments on campus and not the dorms. But I\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s about 10 grand for the year to live in the dorms. I lucked out and qualified for enough grants and scholarships to cover my tuition. As a transfer student in the middle of a pandemic I still enjoy going to school here. I always wanted to go to school here. There\u2019s a been a lot of adjustment but it\u2019s been worth it. \nI hope this helps you, and wish you the best of luck. \n\nChirp chirp!\n\nEdit don\u2019t forget to file for FASFA for right now! That is where I got most of my money help cover The rest of tuition and my rent for the year.",

The vast majority of my school was paid for by scholarships &amp; grants, and I only took like 13K in subsidized federal loans. If you live in an apartment off-campus it's actually relatively affordable, depending on where you go. IN cost of living is pretty low over all.",

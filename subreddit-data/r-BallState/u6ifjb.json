I\u2019m looking to move soon after my masters program is done in the UK September and am looking for a roommate! Thought I\u2019d post in here just to expand horizons. Feel free to remove my post if it doesn\u2019t feel like it belongs in this group. I\u2019m 23 and graduated in may 2021 at Ball State. Thanks!",

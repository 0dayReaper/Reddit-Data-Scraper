The first semester is without a doubt the hardest with learning hiragana, katakana, and the grammar structure. Stay on top, study like crazy.  If you fall behind and think \"ill catch up by second semester\" you wont. The teachers are all great except for one...in my personal opinion, Tei-Sensei) who means well but his style of teaching can be confusing.\n\nTomizawa will tell you, its like being a sports coach, you aren't a pro yet but he will help you get to that level.\n\nwe have a phrase \"Don't Give up on Kanji\" take it to heart. dont give up on it. \n\n\u9811\u5f35\u3063\u3066",

The professors I've had have been very kind and helpful, and you do a lot of in class speaking practice, along with a lot of varied assignments each lesson for different skills. \n\nOnly thing to note is that language classes at BSU are 4 credits instead of the standard 3, but it hasn't really been an issue for my schedule yet. If you want more info, [here](https://catalog.bsu.edu/2021-2022/Undergraduate-Catalog/College-of-Sciences-and-Humanities/Modern-Languages-and-Classics/Major-in-Japanese-BA-BS) is a breakdown of the major and the required courses.",

I noticed in my study abroad program me and another bsu student were ahead compared to students from other schools. By that point I had finished two years of college level Japanese.\n\nProfessors were very helpful and kind. However, I will note there is one professor that myself and many students similarly struggled with solely due to their approach to teaching. I\u2019m hesitant to name names because the professor, while strict, isn\u2019t a bad person. They just aren\u2019t very good at conveying information. Their philosophy is to simply memorize dialogues rather than teach grammar. They literally only had us recite a paragraph from the textbook. No grammar exercises, no free dialogue speaking in class, etc. Compared to the other professors in the program, the classes I had with this one professor were difficult just because they were not really teaching us. I did a lot of outside learning on my own time (of course that\u2019s expected to some extent, but I was basically teaching myself because the professor wasn\u2019t).  In those classes, you couldn\u2019t familiarize yourself enough to use the grammar/Vocab outside of a very specific scenario in a textbook\u2026because that\u2019s all the professor focused on. They would also forget to assign homework, then yell at us for not turning in work that was never assigned. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say every Monday their TA (who would teach on that day) would have to reteach the lesson in a way we could understand. If it weren\u2019t for the TAs (both times I had this professor) it would have been difficult. But again, this professor isn\u2019t malicious, they even recognized they were getting poor reviews and scores and working to change their curriculum, so they may be better now. All this being said, I passed this prof with an A both times I had them, so it\u2019s not like a death sentence to have them. \n\nAside from that, if you study (you will need to. A lot, especially with kanji), listen in class, ask questions, do your homework, you will be successful. \n\nAlso, I took Business Japanese and the Culture classes over the summer which majorly freed up my schedule for fall. Same professor teaches both of those classes and is awesome! So that may be an option for you to look into! Good luck! You\u2019ll enjoy it!",

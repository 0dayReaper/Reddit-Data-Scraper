I get there will be precautions but why not just send them to the hospital where they may need care as it progresses?",

I think that classes above a certain size should have been online this fall.",

I think that\u2019s the idea here. \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if maybe \u201chalf\u201d of the spring semester is online, as that semester aligns more with the traditional cold and flu season.",

They were ones that had a lot of problems last semester (foreign language, yikes.) \n\nI\u2019m expecting half of my classes to be eligible to go online, why even go back to campus for the other two at that point? It wouldn\u2019t be worth it.",

For the online parts I do feel a bit bad for students who need access to labs and studios though.  I imagine it was kind of rough for them when we first went all online and campus was closed",

However, I would still need more scholarships/financial aid/loans in order to be able to start my studies at Ball State. (| am an international student from Nigeria)\n\nAnd as I looked through the uni's website, I was confused a bit because of the plethora of information there. \n\nGuys I need your help. I would like to know what scholarship and financial aid opportunities are available for me, and I would also love to hear your advice regarding other stuff like visa application, students housing, and life generally at Ball State University",

It's a great university!\n\nI did some searching around and found [this page](https://www.bsu.edu/academics/centersandinstitutes/rinker/international-services/new-international-students/admitted-international-students/pre-arrival-information). It does look like a lot of information, and might be overwhelming, but you can always reach out to their phone/email to see if they have someone who can walk you through all of that!",

I am trying to connect to Indian students at Ball State just to get a basic idea about the life of Indian student Ball State but so far no luck. Are there any Indian students here lol?",

Its the dorm where most international students stay as it has break housing, so there's a chance for you to find Indian students there!",

We have the the MWOC (men and women of color) and the Asian Student Union for example. Look into those and consider attending events, even if you cant find other Indian students specifically you might find people you'll click with and who can understand you in some ways. Good luck!",

I stay at an off campus apartment because I\u2019m a graduate student. I don\u2019t know about Indian food stores, but there is an Indian restaurant that is less than appealing. As for culture shock, never had it because I completed my undergrad in the US. So I have lived here for 6 years already",

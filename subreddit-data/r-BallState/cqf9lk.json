    "postText": "Hey fellas, I'm the prez of Ball State's sketch comedy club **Something Else Comedy**. Basically everyone who was in it has graduated the past two years and that SUCKS!! I hate to see it so empty now, and I thought reddit would be the best place to start to find more members because it has become such an outlet for people who are awkward and nerdy and have a weird sense of humor (like this entire fucking website).\n\nTo give a run down of what we do, we meet up once a week to talk about what videos we want to make, go over everyone's scripts and writing, have a writer's room set up for everyone to work together on writing or just help each other out with their own material. SHIT I'm a junior and I still need improvement in a lot of places, bro! Really if you have any sort of material you want to present in front of a group people, whether it be stand-up, jokes, or any other form of writing; sometimes we just mess around and riff with each other because it's such a funny environment. \\[Think *SNL* but not live. Also the founder of the club ended up being a huge producer for *Rooster Teeth (*another sketch format) and is now rich as hell...so not trying to say you'll get rich...but you will.\\]\n\nWe film on the weekends usually in the afternoon so we don't take up anyone's weekend plans, although, we throw some bitchin get togethers where we watch shitty movies like *The Room* or *Love on a Leash* (please look this movie up) and play smash bros all night or until someone rage quits. Super flexible, easy-going and fun group but most of all I think it's such an under the radar niche group of buddy ol pals, I have met such **cool** motherfuckers and it completely changed my Ball State experience. \n\nIt helps you if you're a TCOM student, you get so much practice will Ball State's camera equipment and resources that you wouldn't have otherwise if you're not in any of the classes yet, but we've had people of all majors join who just like to write and perform comedy as a hobby.\n\nSORRY for the long post, this is really important to me and I hope this has peaked some of you weirdos' interest, because I know it's hard to put yourself out there when you're not that social, speaking from experience. I'll be at the Activity Fair this Saturday if you wanna chat or you can PM on here too if you think this might be your scene and want any more information about the club and all that spunk-sauce. \n\nTLDR; Comedy + Weird People = WAY better than sitting in your dorm room all year.",

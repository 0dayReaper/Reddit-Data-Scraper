Do they live in the dorms, in special housing, or just mostly off-campus? I've been searching around the website and talking to people, but no one really has a clear answer.",

            "comment": "They have university-affiliated apartment complexes which are spaced away from campus. Those are Anthony and Scheidler. Typically older students, grad students, and families live there. You can find the rates on BSU\u2019s website. A lot of people opt to live there because you don\u2019t have to search for a roommate (may be assigned one) or you can live on your own, and it takes away the problem of apartment-hunting. \n\nIf you want cheaper housing, look off-campus. There are some cheaper apartment complexes which will require you to take the bus or drive to campus. There are also some within walking distance. Don\u2019t live in Village Promenade if you can help it, it\u2019s very expensive and poorly constructed. \n\nIf you want a roommate or a cheap living situation, look on Facebook housing pages for Muncie. There are a few with local landlords who don\u2019t have their own websites, or people looking for subleasers or roommates. You can also post what you\u2019re looking for and people will comment. These are the names of a few Facebook pages: Muncie Homes For Rent, Muncie Rental Homes, Ball State University Housing, Sublets, and Roommates",

Office staff can be rude, everything breaks, it smells weird, there's rust, and they already increased rent rates twice in the last two years. Also had no regard for covid and all of us losing jobs and yet that's the time they decided to up rent AND put holds on our accounts if we couldn't pay when they SAID they wouldn't in an email. I hate it here, man.",

I'm unsure how common such a situation is though.",

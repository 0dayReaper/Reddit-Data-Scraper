It\u2019s possible that it could have started later but I was glad to see it looks like people are really starting to take this more seriously. But I don\u2019t agree that ALL the blame should be put all on the students. I\u2019m a transfer Junior and this is my first year here. I read about something called late nite that is taking place every weekend with up to 250 students?!?! Should this really be going on when they are telling us to not party Or maybe they should lower the number of students allowed in?",

I still don't think it should be going on, personally, but better to have students there where the university can theoretically keep them distanced than to have them at packed frat houses, I guess. But yeah, definitely seems like everyone could just ACTUALLY fucking quarantine so we can get this over with already.",

No. But it does give people a chance to relax a little and safely have fun. I think it's a better alternative to frat parties at the very least.",

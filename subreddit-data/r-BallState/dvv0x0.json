    "postText": "Hey guys I'll be transferring to BSU Spring semester. I have 20+ credits transferring in, and filled out the housing application about a week ago. If anyone can give me some advice or what to actually expect at Ball State that I won't find on their website I'd appreciate it. I graduated HS my junior year this May and went to Ivy Tech this fall, so I don't really have experience on a good sized college campus. Thanks.",

Most of campus is the main road so it is  fairly easy to navigate once you get comfortable. \n\nJoin an organization or 2. SuperParty is in the spring which is an activity fair.",

Ball state is also a very diverse group of students, you will see some interesting outfits and meet some \u201cdifferent\u201d people, but it\u2019s just a part of learning to grow as an individual.",

I joined the service fraternity on campus (not greek life) and it was the best decision i ever made. it can feel overwhelming and lonely all at the same time and especially during the spring semester when you're cooped up all winter. just talk to people in classes and join a club or two. we're happy to have you!",

    "postText": "Hi all! I'm a grad student at Ball State and recently bought a new laptop and am selling my previous one. It is an early 2011 13\" Macbook Pro (2.3GHz, Intel i5, 8GB, 240GB SS drvie). It has a few major dents that have not impacted it functioning and it runs well. It comes with a hardshell case, the charger, and a felt laptop sleeve. DM me is you're interested. ",

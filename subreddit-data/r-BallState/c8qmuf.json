I graduated Ball State 6 years ago and haven't been active on the subreddit since. To be honest, I completely forgot I was even a moderator until I got the spam notifications earlier today. \n\nI am more than happy to promote anyone who is willing to make this subreddit a better place.  Once I get home I'll review &amp; approve those who already submitted it, I can't do that on mobile as far as I know. \n\nAs a short term solution I banned the 2 users who were posting offensive content.\n\n**Edit: Welcome to our new subreddit moderators u/link9098, u/Juls317, and u/8WhosEar8",

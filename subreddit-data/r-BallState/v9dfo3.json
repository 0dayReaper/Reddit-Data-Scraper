School aside, the whole point is to give you an opportunity to make friends with a more intimate encounter than trying to make friends in full classes. Be outgoing and try to find some people you click with. You'll find that you have a ton of time on your hands that you won't know how to use at first. And definitely get involved with clubs and sports. I can vouch for Esports. Being involved on campus and having friends is night and day with the college experience. Good luck!",

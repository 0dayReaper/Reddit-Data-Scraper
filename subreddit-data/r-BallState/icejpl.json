Birth control is 91% effective and y\u2019all get nutted in all the time or nut inside all the time and don\u2019t think twice about it because \u201cit\u2019s nearly impossible\u201d. Do some research before you spout bull shit that CNN tells you to worry about. And before you downvote me do some research. I doubt you will because \u201ccovid bad, you bad, wear mask\u201d fear mongering bull shit you watch on the news and read on Reddit. \n\nBelow is web MD stating that covid is 99.75% survival. And don\u2019t forget, most deaths from covid are in the 80+ age group from patients who were already on there death bed and a simple common cold or the flue would have killed them. It amazes me how ignorant people are when it comes to important things in life and truly believe whatever the entertainment networks like CNN or Fox say. It\u2019s literally the same effect as the bachelorette where they show some big fight or event and say \u201con the next episode of the bachelorette\u201d it keeps you watching because the suspense of \u201cwhat\u2019s going to happen next\u201d but you\u2019re the person who is being manipulated. I just wish y\u2019all would do more research, and also realize it\u2019s election time. Whether you\u2019re a democrat or republican, you\u2019re being fed bullshit propaganda. Just like black lives matter protests the media claims the protest didn\u2019t cause any outbreaks, or the DNC convention didn\u2019t cause and covid cases but yet college campuses and schools are huge risks. Take a moment and realize something that everyone born as the millennial age group heard as a child, a sarcastic remark \u201ceverything on the internet is true\u201d because it\u2019s not. Where did we get lost in this circle of fuckery where we let Facebook, reddit, Twitter, and entertainment shows that present them self\u2019s as \u201cnews\u201d control all of our ideas? Just please people do some solid research and know the truth before believing everything the \u201cnews\u201d tells you. \n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/lung/covid-recovery-overview",

Once again you\u2019ve done no research besides front page reddit headlines and you talk shit. Don\u2019t forget a large amount of the 3 to .04% death rate is 80+ year old patients who have extreme pre existing conditions. Also we can\u2019t forget about the amount of deaths that were reported as covid and then later reversed. Such as 3 people in one county in Florida.

I'm not assuming anything, I have no background on the situation, I'm not a doctor, I never claimed to be.\n\nI trust his family and friends. I find it kind of insane that you view yourself as having more insight into what happened to him than Ball State and his children but whatever man, I get it. You can't be changed, you don't want to be changed. I pray you good health, my family has lost a loved one to COVID, and another got hospitalized for over 60 days by it. So yes, I do trust the doctors and officials. \n\nOur country has lost over 200,000 more lives than we averagely do by August. You can keep on saying how low the death rate is, but the reality is almost every highly communicable disease has a low death rate (that's how they spread so well). Eventually, that number translates to tangible deaths when enough people are exposed to it. Even if COVID has exactly the death rate you claim (.25%) that still translates to potentially 55 deaths on a campus of 22,000 like BSU.",

It was never classified as covid even when his death was during the height of Covid, also the week after spring break was the last time we had class at Ball State and so that puts his death over a month after in person classes were suspended. Also we have lost 169k people due to covid in the US not over 200k unless you are saying that just in general we have lost 200k more than usual, then I\u2019m curious where the other 30ish Thousand have came from? Maybe because boomers are all reaching very old ages and the baby boom is now the boomers death? Just because I simply don\u2019t agree with the news outlets and dr fakis statements doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t wish people good health. I can show you multiple medical professionals including my mother who is currently leading a covid response team at a major hospital chain in Indiana that do not agree with the media reports on the effect Covid has on the country.  Just because the media broadcast a few individuals who have a certain viewpoint doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re geniuses. I\u2019d actually be intrigued to see data on the research dr faki has done himself on the Covid 19 virus? Because I know my mother has been at the head of it locally since March 11th and her and her peers have the same view point that Covid is being over exaggerated which is actually causing more harm than good because of the lack of accurate data. Also, I wish you good health to, I don\u2019t doubt Covid is real, but from research and primary sources I don\u2019t believe the things being broadcasted about Covid are accurate.\n\nOh and one final thing, Hospital traffic at the hospital my mother is working at has lost 75% of its business during covid and has been making multiple cuts and also they are furloughing multiple medical professionals (RN\u2019s, NP\u2019s, MD\u2019s) weekly because they can not afford to keep them with their patients decreased by 75%. Literally DOCTORS are being paid to answer phones all day and listen to people\u2019s symptoms and they simply give an over the phone diagnosis that is (if you have symptoms stay home, if not you\u2019re fine)",

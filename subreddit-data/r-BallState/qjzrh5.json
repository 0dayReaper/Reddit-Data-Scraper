Big enough but not too big that you start to feel like a small fish in a big pond. \n\nIt's very important to make connections with professors and small and mid-size schools are better with doing it , in my personal opinion\n\nIt's also pretty close to Indy so if you're craving the big city, you have it",

I do need to reiterate that is an estimate\n\nhttps://www.bsu.edu/admissions/tuition-and-fees",

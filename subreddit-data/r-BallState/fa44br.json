There are many apartments that cater to college kids and pair 2-4 people up in apartments based on smoking, age, and night owl vs early riser.   \n\n\nI too suggest looking at Facebook and also check craigslist housing, it\u2019s where I\u2019ve found awesome and affordable apartments close to campus.",

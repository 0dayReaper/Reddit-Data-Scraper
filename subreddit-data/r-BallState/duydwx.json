    "postText": "Any fighting game players here? A buddy and I meet up fairly often and play some fighting games and we were wondering if there are more fighting game players other than us on campus? We have usually been playing older games on Fightcade like Street Fighter Alpha 3 or Third Strike, but I also play quite a few other games online back home. Anyone else out there play anything? I\u2019m not really talking about Smash Bros though, I know they already have their own club and meetup, but I was trying to find some people who play more traditional fighters. Thanks!",

    "postText": "Hello all, I am applying to Ball State University for fall 2021 and as a rule, it is mandatory for an international applicant to get evaluate their academic record through the third party firms (like World Education Services) and submit it to the university. Here is my query- at what particular stage of the whole application process this third party evaluation is required to submit? Do I have to submit it while applying or it would be required after getting conditional admission result?\n\nI want to know because this evaluation is expensive which cost around $ 245 and if I have to submit it in the initial phase of application I would have to give serious thought on spending this huge sum on just one university. If it is required once student get an acceptance offer, then at least the surety would be there and he/she could think to pay. \n\nAnd I am applying in educational psychology graduate (PhD) program.\n\nHope to get help. Thank you.",

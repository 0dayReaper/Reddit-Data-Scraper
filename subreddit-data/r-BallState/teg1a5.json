There are some jobs that require a prestigious university and good GPA to land a better job, but that's not really too common with bachelor degrees.\n\nGenerally, people put Ball State down because they're dicks and want to make themselves feel better. They've been told one thing or another, and now have to validate their choice. \n\nWe've gone to a conference before and MIT was there and they were jealous of some of the immersive learning style opportunities we were getting to do at Ball State, so every school has its pros and cons.",

Ball State is an excellent college for Nursing, Teaching, Technology, Telecom, and even Architecture, I'd say. Most of the rest of the programs there are \"just fine\" and will give you plenty of marketable skills to make you just as attractive as someone with an IUB degree in a similar field.\n\nHowever, I will say that Muncie itself sucks due to its location. It's so far out from anything, it's annoying to get to, no one will want to come visit you, and so forth. People will say that \"there's nothing to do in Muncie,\" but I'm sure you can find some things... I grew up in Anderson, so Muncie was a step up in terms of \"things to do.\" There's always something going on on campus, and BSU's campus is one of the more beautiful ones I've ever seen.",

Compare our two big state schools to any comparable state. We probably tie or barely lose to Michigan because their flagship is good enough to drag MSU along. We beat the other neighboring states, two of which are much bigger in both population and economy, and the other is Kentucky, where learning is illegal. \n\nWhen I went to graduate school, the most insulting thing anyone said about my 2 years at BSU was asking if Ball State was D2. The same person asked a student from Auburn if she was used to wearing shoes yet, so it\u2019s not like he was holding back. \n\nBall State is big enough to have fun and explore, but not so sprawling and competitive that you\u2019ll get run over. I mean that academically, socially, and physically. If you want more, you can always transfer.\n\nIt\u2019s not a bad school by any stretch. Chirp! Chirp!",

It has it\u2019s not nice areas like most places do, but overall it\u2019s really pleasant. I saw in one of your replies that you want to teach, and it has one of the best teaching colleges in the country. Your friends have no clue what they\u2019re talking about and probably haven\u2019t ever been here.",

Not saying it\u2019s without flaws but for me it was a perfect-sized campus with enough going on in school, clubs, and friend groups around the outskirts to keep things interesting. Personally I think it\u2019s much easier to meet and connect with people there than other larger schools, I think you\u2019ll be happy with your choice!",

I stayed at Ball State to do my Masters because I knew the professors and what I wanted to do! \n\nGo chase your dreams \ud83d\ude42",

Depending on what you are wanting to do, you can build so many connections by simply getting involved in campus.\n\nBall State has so much to offer, it just has a bad reputation because it is a party school, which the extent of which is over exaggerated.\n\nYou will enjoy ball state, and it\u2019s a good place to get your degree, especially if you want to go one for your masters/phd/etc at a more nationally recognized school.",

I experienced the same thing as a high school senior when I committed to BSU, and my friends that chose other schools are now drop outs because they hated it, and I\u2019m still here at BSU! Ball State has an amazing education/teaching program, as well as nursing and architecture. Don\u2019t listen to your friends, you\u2019ll love it here! No school is perfect, but Ball State comes pretty close for me :)",

Except one particular math teacher, so watch out. I won\u2019t lie there are some gaps in my knowledge that I wish they would\u2019ve elaborated on for my student teaching( I\u2019m going through right now.) and the set up process for Student Teaching was a little complicated for no reason. But A friend of mine is a sophomore right now and they are actually trying to prepare her for EdTPA unlike my graduating class. I love the campus, the professors and the majority of the administration staff is helpful. Coming to Ball State for education for teaching will give you a very large leg up for the competition.",

Because the school was a little bit smaller I had some awesome hands-on research opportunities that would have been much harder to get at a larger school, and now I\u2019m almost done with my PhD at a big school. I look at some of the hoops students have to jump through to get research experience at my current school and am always thankful I never had that stress at BSU!",

Ball State is a good school for teaching and I think they in particular do a good job with more practical experiences (I was at Northside middle school my first semester and volunteer at the boys and girls club this semester, both for my classes)\nI was also accepted to IU Bloom and chose not to go there because Ball State was a little cheaper and had more music opportunities for me (I\u2019m a band kid lol). In some ways your friends are right, Bloomington and West Lafayette are cooler towns with more to do. But Ball State is also a pretty big school and has plenty of opportunities as well. If you were a business or stem major it\u2019d be different, but as an education major you are making a good decision.",

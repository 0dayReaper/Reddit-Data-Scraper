    "postText": "Hi guys!! I am going to be coming to muncie for my masters. I\u2019ve been looking for furnished 2 bed apartments on or near campus. Initially I really liked scheidler but I haven\u2019t been able to find a roommate yet for it. (I need a female roommate who is easy going and respect my personal space). I am also looking for other options bit i am honestly clueless at this point, I don\u2019t know where to look anymore and what is the best price since I\u2019m an international student and not a local. I would appreciate ANY help or guidance regarding housing or renting. Pleaseeeee HELP!",

The company is run by individuals who have no connection to Ball State. I\u2019m not quite sure how they didn\u2019t get served a cease and desist to use BSU in their name. And I do concur, they aren\u2019t highly recommended.",

It\u2019s quite common, actually, for these people to form LLCs in college towns, often assuming the name of the college in their business name, and buy up rental properties to manage.\n\nInterestingly, I just looked them up, and because they didn\u2019t file their business entity report for 3 years, the secretary of state administratively dissolved their business entity registration in 2018. They may have organized/filed under an entirely new name. I don\u2019t know for certain.",

Actually I should have said they were out-of-town investors, from Indy. So I was wrong there. But they are not tied to the university, and the original company is indeed dissolved.\n\nA new company using the name BSU Campus Rentals II LLC is assumed by a local CPA, who owns a couple of properties in the \u201cBSU II\u201d LLC name. Again not affiliated with the university. That version of the company name is not registered with the state from what I can tell. Interestingly this guy also worked for the previous company, my daughter rented from him. They do suck.\n\nMy son rented from IU Campus Rentals or something similarly named, in Bloomington. They were out-of-state. It wasn\u2019t a great experience for him either.",

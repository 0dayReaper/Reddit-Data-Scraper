You could get sandwiches or drinks but not merchandise like mugs or insulated cups. Chickfila and papa John's are in the atrium so they are more like a food court. You can pick different items within the atrium and take the to a central cashier to swipe your card.",

But otherwise yeah you can use dining plus and meal swipes at them all. Tip, if you have dining plus leftover at the end of the semester you used to be able to use it to buy mugs and stuff from Starbucks.",

The nicer the house, the higher the costs is a good general rule of thumb. Plus there are all the events that they participate in or host, which costs money as well. \n\nFall dues are typically higher than spring because fall rush is a big expense.",

You can ask each fraternity what dues are for the last couple of semesters. If they\u2019re not transparent up front, then run like hell. \n\nAlso, make sure you ask about hazing. I was dead set on one fraternity when I was going through rush, but one of the seniors refused to directly answer the question. They later got booted off campus for a multitude of reasons but I joined the house next door. This probably won\u2019t be as big of an issue now as it was back then, but you never know what kind of shady stuff happens behind closed doors \n\nIf you do rush, it\u2019s most important that you get along with guys that\u2019ll be in the same pledge class as you. The older guys will graduate soon, so even if you love hanging out with them, they won\u2019t be around soon enough. I always hung out with the younger guys more so than I did with the older guys.",

You\u2019ll be going on more beer runs than you\u2019re comfortable with.",

Hell, when I was there, we had a fifth-year senior join his last semester on campus just because it's something he wanted to do. And don't be afraid to bring a friend of yours with you and you guys can rush together if you're concerned about being alone or not fitting in with the rest of the pledge class. Most (smart) fraternities during rush week are going to ask you anyway if you know of anyone else that would be interested in joining.",

Hit them up and ask what their fees are and what it covers. It will probably seem high at initial glance, but keep in mind that this likely includes rent for living in the house, several meals per week, a ton of social activities, unlimited intramural sports fees, and more. Once you compare fraternity dues to what you would be paying for all of those things if you didn't join one, I think you'll see it's not that much of a difference.",

    "postText": "I only need an apartment or room for the fall semester. I know the Haven and Varsity House offer short term leases, but they\u2019re both a bit expensive for my budget. I also looked at the University apartments, but I\u2019d have to find a roommate for a 2bedroom. Are there any fall-semester only leases or fall-semester only subleases at a nearby off campus house?",

I\u2019m a pre-med student so I don\u2019t particularly have much interest in the classes and will be doing a lot of extracurricular stuff. Are the classes difficult? Enjoyable? \nLooking at a few options for schooling and I like ball state I\u2019m just unsure if I want to attend due to the required honors classes. Figured some of y\u2019all have gone through them and may be able to tell me what they are like!",

            "comment": "In my opinion, I found them easier than the required core classes and all of them were manageable. However, they are all discussion based (no tests) so if you don\u2019t like to talk in class this may not be the path for you. Another perk that I loved is that they have paid research positions that are only offered to honors college students and you can work on a project of your choice with any professor from any department. It\u2019s also very easy to drop if you find this program is not right for you.",

A lot of professors, especially in chemistry and biology will take most of any student interested. Another thing, a lot of they paid research positions are not very lucrative, so if you have financial responsibilities in college it might be challenging to balance bills and research.",

            "comment": "I think the difficulty varies greatly depending on the professor/section of the course you take. Because there are so many options for course topics, there is also a lot of variety in assignments, discussion expectations, etc. For the most part I'd say the difficulty was comparable to my other classes in related subject areas, with the exception of my HONR 199 class which was more difficult than most of my other history classes by far, and I say that as a history major. I would echo what another comment said about the classes generally being more discussion based. Again, going to vary depending on the class - some of my profs required you to speak at least once every class, while others didn't have requirements but definitely encouraged you to speak up as much as possible. More than anything, most of the Honors courses are going to make you *think* more than, say, a gen ed class in a similar subject. So, if you're prepared to do some critical thinking, you'll be fine.",

But tailgating is the number one sport at Ball State. They are fun and rowdy. But if ur under 21 be very very careful. The cops are like vultures busting underage kids. You can usually drink out of coke cans or unlabeled cups but they watch for people pouring liquids into other containers.",

Students usually go home when the tailgate fields close and the crowd is mostly made up of locals, athlete family members and freshmen. The MAC conference isn't exactly exciting and Ball State isn't exactly known for being good. If you're like me and just enjoy watching football, don't let that bum you out and go to some games to see if you like it. Hope you get to experience it this year!\n\nGo to a BSU gymnastics meet when you get the chance. Tons of talent and super fun.",

Like others said, it's not like going to a game at a bigger school, but there's kind of a smaller town feel that's kinda fun. I always felt like stuff at the games was geared more toward the whole community rather than just the university folks, which was nice.",

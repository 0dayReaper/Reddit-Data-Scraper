Choosing to stay open shows how little this business actually cares for it's employees and community. I have personally seen the employees not wearing masks if there are no customers inside and have seen them standing outside sharing cigarettes/vapes. If they are not wearing masks while cooking food, making drinks, or cleaning, none of their masks matter in the end. The Cup, along with every business in the Village should make the decision to shut down until classes move online. If you can charge $10 for a frozen sandwich, you can shut down for 2 weeks and require all employees to get tested before infecting hundreds of people.",

This post is riddled with inaccuracies. My housemate works at The Cup, and they have been keeping me updated on this situation.  A girlfriend of a roommate of an employee tested positive, and the employee that could have possibly been exposed to her stopped coming in when they found out she was sick. This was more than encouraged by the owner and manager because they want to keep their employees and community safe.  Masks are worn while making anything that is going out to the customers. I am not sure if OP was given inaccurate information or if OP fully twisted the information they were given to make a small business already struggling in the midst of the pandemic look bad, but this could not be further from the truth. Anyways this same energy better be shown for corporate companies that are making known sick employees come in. The Cup has anti-maskers attacking their facebook page because of how strict they are at enforcing masks. There are businesses that don\u2019t require masks or any social distancing, so i don\u2019t see what good attacking a business that enforces these things is doing. Small businesses cannot afford to close due to not being provided for during the pandemic. Necessary precautions are being taken. No employee has tested positive. Stop spreading rumors and hurting small businesses that are doing all they can to stay afloat and keep their employees safe.\n\n******* My roommate said that she wishes the sandwiches were frozen because it would make her job a heck of a lot easier. ********",

Others have said the same. \n\nI'd also been told that the roommate's girlfriend was the first point of exposure, but also that the entire household was sick with COVID symptoms and testing positive AND that this employee had been at work days prior. People infected with COVID are very infectious before they even start to show symptoms. \n\nI don't think anyone posting here with concerns is out to get a small business.

I am guaranteeing that your hearsay is incorrect or you misunderstood what the employee you know said. I would suggest speaking with them to make sure you have the facts right because you are wrong. No one in the house has gotten results yet. I am close with who you are speaking about and you do not have any of the facts right. I directly know the people who live at the house in question and the other employees. The people in the house got tests out of fear and to make sure they wouldn\u2019t spread it. The employee who was possibly exposed said that they feel fine and are just waiting on the test results at this point (a personal conversation I had with them, not hearsay). So please stop spreading misinformation. If you want to be concerned because they don\u2019t wear masks when customers aren\u2019t inside, be concerned about that, but also keep in mind there are plenty of businesses that aren\u2019t requiring anything and forcing sick workers to come in.

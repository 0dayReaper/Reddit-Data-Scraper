The apartments owned by the university do require you to be a student, but I think varsity house is independent. She's going to need to find someone to take over her contract for next year. Look over the contract, she may be required to pay a fee to have a subleaser. there may also be an option to pay a fee to get out of the contract. She should make an appointment with student legal services at ball state. They can help her understand the contract, and what her options are.",

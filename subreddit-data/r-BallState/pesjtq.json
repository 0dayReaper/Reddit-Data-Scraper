I\u2019d assume they would be in Ball Communication or Letterman Building and that you\u2019d have to sign them out. If I\u2019m right or if anyone knows where they are, I\u2019d love to know.",

Better to make friends with MMP students who are interested in learning your stuff and do a quid pro quo",

You might be able to talk with a music tech student about seeing if you can get it done, but I wouldn't be optimistic about it.",

MMP majors have access 24/7 and would LOVE the opportunity for some practice with you. The studios are really nice and they record professional level stuff in there all the time.",

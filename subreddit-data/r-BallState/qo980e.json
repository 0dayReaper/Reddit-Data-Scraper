    "postText": "I\u2019m a graduate student in the psychological sciences department, and for my diversity class, I\u2019m looking for three potential candidates to interview on a cultural issue, which in my case is immigration/xenophobia since I\u2019m an international student. The interview will take place on zoom or anywhere you\u2019d feel comfortable. I\u2019m ready to compensate you with $10. Please let me know at the earliest by messaging me! If you agree to be interviewed, I\u2019ll need to send your name and BSU email to my professor, but we can discuss the details later on!",

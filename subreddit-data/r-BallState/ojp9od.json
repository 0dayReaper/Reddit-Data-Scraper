    "postText": "Hello everyone. So long story short, I am a second-year master's student at BSU studying Linguistics. I got a teaching position this year, so it will be fantastic experience for me before I graduate... Except that it doesn't pay that well. I don't want to have to take out more loans than I already have, so I am leaving Varsity House in search of a cheaper apartment.\n\nI am ready to leave my apartment as soon as possible, so anyone that wants to take the lease, here is the info:\n\nNumber of rooms: 3.\n\nAmmenities: Bedroom includes own bathroom and HUGE closet, dishwasher and washer/dryer. Living room includes bed and desk for room and sofa, armchairs, dining room table, and television in living toom.\n\nRent: $549/mo + $12 insurance\n\nElectricity: It depends, but for me, it was about 70-80 per month per person in the apartment. Unfortunately I have had months as high as $100 for electricity, but that is only when we are greedy with the air conditioning.\n\n(all other utilities are covered, and the apartment comes with actually good internet)\n\nI won't post pics here, but if you want them, feel free to email me at [sghall4@bsu.edu](mailto:sghall4@bsu.edu) or call/text me at 574-250-2199.\n\nEDIT: I'll pay the $300 leasing fee, so you don't have to worry about that. You will just be responsible for rent and electric when you move in.",

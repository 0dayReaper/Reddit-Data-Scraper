Letterman made fun of us weekly....We had the nation\u2019s longest losing streak, actually tore down the goalposts when we broke it. My wife was in grad school in 2008 when we went undefeated only to lose in the most crazy way in the MAC Championship game to a clearly inferior Buffalo team (two botched snaps returned for TDs)...this is a long time coming. Congratulations to the Cards!!!",

I\u2019ll never forget the \u201cChester Taylor game\u201d against Toledo where we held that guy to something like 30 yards rushing, won the game, and stormed the field. People were hyping that dude as a Heisman candidate before the game. Not so much afterwards.",

Also tore down the goalposts that game too. Unfortunately a kid was paralyzed when one fell on him...which led the school to install ones that couldn\u2019t be torn down/or set down before the end of a game",

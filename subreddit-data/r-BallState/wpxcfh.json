    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am no longer a student at Ball State (graduated 2 years ago) however, yesterday I was reminded of how insanely incompetent and disrespectful BSU rentals, one of the largest rental companies in Muncie, is to its renters.\nYesterday I helped my girlfriend move into an apartment under BU rentals and the condition of the apartment was poor to say the least, and resulted in BSU rentals employees scurry around and yell at other people on the phone to blame for the \u201cerrors and miscommunications\u201d. I feel this is a recurring cycle every year with countless stories from students and Muncie residents regarding how difficult and egregiously incompetent BSU rentals are to their tenants. College is already stressful enough for students and to add unnecessary and avoidable stress and headache to the housing situations of our students is beyond\nwrong.\n\nSo here is my idea, we'll it can be anyones idea really. I think a change.org petition must be created in regards to these issues and brought to light both to the community of Muncie and to the administrators of Ball State University. \n\nUnfortunately since I am no\nlonger a student, nor do I reside in Muncie anymore, I feel it wouldn't be appropriate for me to bear the creation of this petition, rather it should be someone who has been personally affected by this.\n\nProfessional negligence from BU rentals has been tolerated for far too long and I feel things must change to improve student life and student academics at Ball State University.",

BSU Rentals has sucked for as long as I can recall (started at Ball State in 2013) and the only thing that's going to solve it is either them fucking up so bad they open themselves up to huge liability, or people just refusing to rent from them.",

Everything is favorable towards the landlords. If you want to make it better, start buying up properties in Muncie and renting them out. Be known for your attention to detail and customer service. Otherwise, there\u2019s nothing that can really be done on a wide scale (and that company knows it)",

The school is not going to want the situation of advertising for students to come to their school then in small font be like, \u201coh btw, if you don\u2019t live in a dorm, have fun dealing with shitty rental companies that pickpocket you via lease agreements and unfounded/duplicated fees. It\u2019s a bad look for Ball State if BSU rentals continues this trajectory and they should have a vested interest in finding a solution alongside the student tenants. I think a petition with the right amount of virality and directed at the right people can go a long way even if it\u2019s just a virtual piece of paper with virtual signatures.",

I guess the could go to the city and try to flex their monetary power there but, again, unless BSU Rentals is violating lease agreements then there isn't much to be done. and if they *are* violating their lease agreements (which it does seem like they likely are), the tenants should absolutely be looking into this themselves already, probably something along the lines of a class-action.",

That is, you're going to court saying \"they did this, and here's the damage it caused, and they need to make up for it.\" Just being unprofessional or annoying won't do it. Even violating the lease, unless it causes actual damage, won't generally be something you can sue over. The courts don't need to waste their time on tons of suits because someone didn't follow the rules, was rude, etc. You have to show you were harmed.",

I take very good care of my kids but we were thinking about moving to a management company simply because students don\u2019t seem to be able to find our houses.  We can\u2019t advertise like the bigger places do because we can\u2019t afford it.

People won't start looking for rentals until the end of this year beginning of next, and they'll vaguely remember \"bsu rentals bad\". \n \nWhen I was looking for a place to move we were calling them our last resort and after seeing properties from the other agencies it felt like they were the only game in town. They're going to keep scooping up rentals even though they dont have the staff or capacity to manage them- its always about growing, 400 tenants isn't enough, they're going to try to do probably 600 next year and it'll be the same show. Maybe they'll be smart and not have the majority of their tenets on the same day, but even that is doubtful. \n \nOn top of that I do believe I read/heard gossip that they're in the middle of some of the river walk district developments, high end apartments I believe, but again this bad press ain't going to change anything. \n \nThey already run half their properties under Middletown Property Group, so they'll just pivot to that name and do a \"BSU rentals? Never heard of it\" sorta thing, but that'd only be if this situation gets much worse. \n \nThe other unfortunate reality is that they'll probably end up hiring PR people before any more maintenance guys, and they should because their response was God awful. They just shifted the blame to 3rd party cleaners, as if a contractor isn't responsible for their subcontractor. Maybe that's how it works for a ~~ glorified slumlord~~ property management company, but most contractors will take responsibility for their sub. \n \nAlso, I do enjoy the \"do you know how much money we spend in Muncie?!\" They're acting like a drunk 21yr old getting kicked out the bar \"it's not my fault!\" \"Do you know who I am?\" \"I'm here so often I pay your salary!\" Only thing they missed is \"I'm friends with the boss\"\n \ntl;dr they suck, but unfortunately it doesn't matter, they're the only game in town, have deep pockets and are already embedded in the cities projects",

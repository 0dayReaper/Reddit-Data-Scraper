To the place where y'all put the trays. And yet y'all can't even be assed to use it. And yet, you like to yell \"Save the planet uwu.\" Yeah, okay. Don't get mad at people for being wasteful when you do the same exact thing. Please just recycle more. Thank you.",

Dining halls shouldn\u2019t be handing out gobs of plastic bags and plastic utensils and students shouldn\u2019t be accepting it. When I was there I kept a real fork and spoon in my backpack and when dining staff tried to bag my food I always said \u201cno thanks.\u201d It\u2019s not that hard. \n\nIt\u2019s important to recycle as you point out but what\u2019s more useful is reducing the amount of single use plastic and bags in the first place. For some of the food that\u2019s prepackaged that is harder or impossible but for some of it you don\u2019t have to take the plastic. You can ask that your food be put in a paper boat and not on a plastic plate, you can not take the plastic forks, you can say no to the plastic bag. Every time I saw someone walk out of a dining hall with a plastic bag of food I just wanted to be like wow is it that hard to carry a box of food? Really?",

They also offer free reusable bags at the beginning of the year.  I have made it a point to use them more often this year, and try to reuse the plastic bags that I do end up using.\n\nI have also never see dining use plastic plates and this comes from a student still at the school.  They do use paper plates though and they use plastic take out containers, however, they don't use plastic plates.  \n\nThe dining halls have reusable silverware too, except the Atrium and maybe the student center???  I have also seen this problem at Woodworth before and they have issues with students stealing silverware, especially forks so sometimes it is hard to not use a plastic fork when there is none available.  You could bring your own fork, but then the issue is is how would you wash it after you eat it?  Carrying dish soap and a rag isn't as simple as carrying silverware and I don't want to put dirty silverware in my bag.",

The single use plastic seemed to become more and more common over the years, so I'm really glad to hear that trend isn't continuing. The plates I was referencing are maybe better referred to as containers? At some point during my time on campus many of the vendors got takeout containers and they switched to using them for everything. Some had lids that were attached and some didn't so if you wanted your food \"to go\" they would just close it or put the lid on for you.",

                                    "comment": "They still have containers, but they give you an option for here or to go.  They usually default to reusable and washable plates for the most part, except if you get pasta, where they have the Chinese style carryout as the default.  I usually tell them for here though because I do not like the to go bowls.   The atrium really should have more environmental friendly options and reusable silverware though.  They still offer single use plastic, but the reusable silverware is closer to the cash registers while disposable silverware is farther away, which makes it much easier to get.  I really only get plastic silverware if everyone at Woodworth takes all of the forks or something.    We just got to get people to stop stealing the reusable forks at Woodworth lol.  Yeah the school can do better in some aspects.  Like have a place to recycle plastic bags like Walmart or other supermarkets do, especially if they are going to offer plastic bags for students to take.",

When you are eating at Woodworth, you would have to go to the bathroom to wash the plastic out and then recycle it even then.

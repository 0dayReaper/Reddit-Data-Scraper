            "comment": "There's tons to do! If bars are your deal, the Village caters to all types. Brothers is the sorority/frat crowd. The Chug is often the theater/hipster crowd (would highly recommend). Not a drinker? No fret. There's live music at Be Here Now (which is also a bar). There's clubs on campus related to your major as well. Ball State has a \"tonight show\" that was called Ball State Tonight I believe. Find out when the Communications Superparty is and attend. Tons of information about clubs and organizations I'm sure you'd be interested in. From what I understand though, most of your social life in the major will come from the \"boot camp\" period all TCOM students have to do. Good luck and hope this helped!",

When they were the first venue to announce allowing no masks, they were super rude and flippant to concerned students on their official social media when they brought up the worsening capacity we were reaching in Muncie hospitals. It made a lot of current patrons ditch it for the owner's showing their ass like that.",

Be Here Now is still packed in some days so I didnt know this happened.\n\nAlso, wearing a mask in the bar is kinda stupid IMO, just like wearing a masks in restaurants. People will literally drop thier masks to eat and drink which causes more droplets in the air than just talking.",

            "comment": "I'm a '21 TCOM grad. Go to CCIM SuperParty on campus when it's happening, it's basically a giant tcom showcase of all the clubs and organizations on offer. Find a couple good ones like the film festival, the student film production club, BSU Tonight, etc. and join multiple.\n\nMost of your circle will probably be made up of people you work with there since you'll inevitably end up on projects together in either class or on extracurricular organizations/shoots (which you should always be looking to attend as a TCOM student btw). It's easiest to network with fellow TCOM/theatre kids that way because of the overlap on projects + the \"oh shit you worked on that?!\" recognition you can get if you're working on good projects.\n\nOutside of TCOM specific stuff, campus always has something happening if you stay tapped in the right networks and off-campus life is fun and probably has good parties now that Covid is starting to fade. It did prior. If you're stuck in a dorm, get involved there too and just keep your door open if you wanna socialize/meet with people on your floor. If you really wanna make friends, the pro tip is to cook food in the kitchenettes and willingly give some out cause those folks will stick around for life after lmao.\n\nThe Chug and Brother's are the two biggest bars. The Mexican restaurant on the Village is open late and great drunk food alongside Hot Box pizza, Yats, and Jimmy John's (tho idk their hours as well). Everything is within walking distance of campus.\n\nLong post but all that got me through my 4 years. If your biggest complaint is things being dead, you got nothing to worry about.",

Initiate with people you meet in classes that you get along with or at work if you choose to work during school. There\u2019s a decent bar scene, as others have mentioned. \n\nCovid dampened a lot of the social engagement for students for the past two years. A lot people are more inclined to go out now than they might have been before, so hopefully the social scene is ramping back up in the fall.",

            "comment": "My big advice for friends is to join clubs and professional fraternities. If you like sports, board games, speak a foreign language, there\u2019s a club for that. Most majors have a club to go with it. You get to meet people within your major, your professors, and their graduate assistants outside of the classroom. Ball State has a pretty decent Greek life. There\u2019s the Frats/Sororities that are more social and are more associated with parties. Then you have professional frats that are coed which are for networking and adding to your resume. \n\nFeel free to dm if you have questions, I\u2019m a current student.",

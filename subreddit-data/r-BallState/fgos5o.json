We just allowed someone from a locked down country (Italy) to walk around coughing for two days that we know of. All those kids went home to their parents and those parents went to work and their kids went to school and so on, we can see how just one person potentially screwed over a town, potentially a state with the infective rate. We need to make safe decision at this rate even if it\u2019s \u201cextreme\u201d",

    "postText": "So my girlfriend and I have been dating a little more than 8 months now. We have never been happier, and we tell each other that all the time. When I feel its just us two that remains true for us. Only, her roommate keeps causing problems for us. She can\u2019t take a joke so I stop saying jokes. She can\u2019t deal with her ex being mentioned so we stop saying that. Meanwhile, she insists on being blunt and be allowed to say whatever. She holds my gf and I to a higher standard than herself. We thought she may have given us COVID and she got mad that I told my mom about the situation while waiting in line with the two of them to get tested. I really don\u2019t think she was ever owed an apology but I did anyways cause her anger was consuming my gf and I\u2019s time. Meanwhile she wouldn\u2019t apologize for going to party and almost getting COVID and cancelling our weekend plans. She wouldn\u2019t even forgive me even though she insisted on an in person apology. She says she needs action to replace bad memories with me, even though I try to explain to her I understand her perspective and sorry its caused her inconvenience. \n\nEdit: Right now, the roommate and I aren\u2019t talking and my gf sticks up for me. But my gf and I are hurt still.",

I assume there is more to the story and that being stuck around each other is making it worse. But roommates don't always work out. Ruined some of my best friends relationships.",

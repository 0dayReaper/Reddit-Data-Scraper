I already meet all of the qualifications for living off-campus, but I have no idea where to start. I don't know anyone at Ball State looking for a roommate, nor can I find any site that doesn't seem shady and doesn't ask for a full-access fee for finding roommates. Is there anybody I can contact for some sense of where to start?",

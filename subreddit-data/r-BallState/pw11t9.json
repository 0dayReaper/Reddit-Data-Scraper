There\u2019s also a Farmer\u2019s Market every Saturday morning there.\n\nDowntown Muncie is neat, there\u2019s some good bars there if you\u2019re of age. \n\nThe Muncie Arts Walk is also happening soon I think.",

There\u2019s the twin archers pub, which has a 21+ side as well as a family side, delicious food and able to draw on tables. There\u2019s the barking cow, an ice cream joint. Downtown also has the Cannon Commons where they have live bands and occasionally they\u2019ll project movies up on a building. Downtown has a bunch of little shops to explore as well.   \n\n\nBall state has a bunch of little hides holes all over in buildings, could be fun to try and discover them or have a picnic in a secluded place. The planetarium is a good place to go that everyone forgets about, as well as Christy Woods. Bracken has little booths that you can rent out and watch movies and such in,  or the most comfortable, but they\u2019re there.",

            "comment": "I graduated from nrem with the environmental management option in 2009. I focused on the water quality side. I think dr. Pitchtel is the only remaining prof. that was there when I was. His classes were really cool but other than that idk what the professors are like these days. \nI also took some electives from the biology and chemistry departments that weren\u2019t required for my major but that I felt where beneficial (microbiology and organic chemistry). \n\nThere were also some cool summer sessions that were only a week long that got me 3 credit hrs each: wetland delineation and HAZWOPPER. They were really interesting too. \n\nSince it has joined with the geology dpt. I don\u2019t know how that has affected the courses or option requirements. \n\nAll that being said in terms of career outlook I think it makes more sense to just get a chemistry degree with an nrem minor. Most jobs that you could get with nrem you could also get with a chemistry degree but not the other way around. Chem will be harder but there are tutoring and group study options available.\n\n**edit**: dr. Amy Gregg was there when I was but I never has her as a professor.",

The other professors in the department now are pretty good too, there\u2019s no one I would say to stay away from. \n\nAs far as getting Chem major and NREM minor, I could see it working out to replace an Environmental Management major but not so much for Natural Resources. EM is a lot more chemistry intensive than NR (requires second semester gen-chem and first semester orgo OR microbiology instead). Given that NR doesn\u2019t require a lot of chemistry, I wouldn\u2019t think that a chemistry degree could fit in its place as well.",

            "comment": "I'm an NREM major, I like it. There's two sides/concentrations to it: Natural Resources or Environmental Management. The base classes are the same (Water, Air, and Soil Resources and few others), but there's lots of different paths that branch from there. NR tends to be land management, parks and rec, etc. Environmental Management is a little more technical with stuff like site remediation, environmental clean-up, emergency response, etc. It also involves more chem classes. Are you a current student? If you want to know more, I would contact Dr. Tim Carter, who is the current chair of the merged NREM and Geology departments, and Dr. Amy Gregg, the previous chair of the NREM Department. There's also an NREM club. If you're interested in that, email their club email address, which you can find on Benny Link.",

I wouldn't say it's super difficult overall, but I wouldn't pick a major based on how difficult it is. You should decide based on what you're interested in. If there's something you like, don't decide against it because you think it will be difficult. If you like it enough you'll be motivated to work through it. No major is going to be so hard that you can't do it.",

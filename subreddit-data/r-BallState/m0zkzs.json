    "postText": "My name is Keldyn Young, and I am an undergraduate Psychological Science student at Ball State University working on a research project for my capstone course with Dr. Anjolii Diaz. Our project is interested in how emotional support provided by familial figures and peers compare among first and continuing generation college students because previous research indicated familial and peer support can be very influential on factors that impact first and continuing generation college students. Participation involves completing a survey that will take approximately thirty minutes to complete and will be completely anonymous. Participants must be at least 18 years old and enrolled in a college or university. There is no compensation for this study.\n\nShould you have any questions or concerns, please email me, Keldyn Young, [klyoung@bsu.edu](mailto:klyoung@bsu.edu)or Anjolii Diaz, [adiaz6@bsu.edu](mailto:adiaz6@bsu.edu)\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nStudy Title: Emotional Support Among College Students IRB Number: 1690775-1\n\n[https://bsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_5pYxyQlXSFcEh9z](https://bsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5pYxyQlXSFcEh9z)",

Not sure if things have changed since I graduated but they had short shifts (2-3 hours) and you can pick where and when you wanted to work. I worked in Noyer, usually in the dishroom (chaotic around dinner time) and the cooler (very easy shift).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, it is pretty easy to get hired. If you apply and they call you in, the job is pretty much yours",

You just sit at the front desk to a dorm hall and do some mail stuff for the residents, check out equipment for rec rooms, sign people in at night, things like that. Most of the time you can just study and get some work done when you\u2019re not doing anything else. I never did this job I just know a lot of people who did so that\u2019s about all I know about the job.",

Housing and Residence Life permanent employees are all manner of special snowflakes, but most RAs are pretty chill. Complying with the asinine paperwork and duty requirements of being an RA were tedious but doable with a double major.\n\nThe campus bookstore wasn't a bad place to work so long as you steered clear of the general manager Ron. He was moody and abrasive if he didn't like you. Dude was obsessed with being the best bookstore ever in the entire history of the world and was kind of a dick when it came to scheduling shifts around required classes. He passed that mentality onto his assistant manager Toni who did the scheduling and grunt work for him.",

Best experience of my life. I wasn\u2019t the hard core type who super strict, I let my students do their thing. \nThat said as an incoming freshman, on campus jobs who a lot have mentioned are decent. Keeps you close to your classes and dorm, different roles and some are pretty easy (desk job already mentioned, lots of time to study or read), and depending on the job can offer flexible hours.",

I worked for the school of music for 3.5 years and absolutely loved it. I also worked for the criminal justice department for a summer and hated it. If you're interested in office-type work, I'd just recommend that you get a feel for the work and the manager before agreeing to the position; it can also help if you're interested in the subject matter of the department. I did always want to work at the bowling alley but never got the chance...\n\n\nHope this helps and good luck!",

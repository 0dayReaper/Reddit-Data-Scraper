    "postText": "I haven't even been accepted into my graduate program yet, so take this for what you will. I'm looking at Fall Break 2021, and I'm hoping to plan a trip that same week. However, Fall break only covers Monday, Tuesday and NOT the rest of the week. I cannot find anything to get an idea of the average number of unexcused absences that are normally allowed. I know this could change based on any number of variables, but does anyone know how many unexcused absences I should expect to be able to take? Thanks for any help!\n\nP.S. I'm looking at the Mental Health Counseling program, if that matters.\n\nP.S.S I know it sounds bad to look at how many classes I'm allowed to skip before I even get into the school, but I'm a good student. I promise, straight A's and everything.",

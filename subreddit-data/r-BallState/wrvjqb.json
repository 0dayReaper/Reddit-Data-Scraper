There is an activity fair in the Rec Center (right across from the old dorms their tearing down) from 6:00-8:00pm. You will be seeing a ton of fliers for a TON of organizations throughout the next month or so. Keep your eyes and ears out and don\u2019t be afraid to get out of your comfort zone! :)",

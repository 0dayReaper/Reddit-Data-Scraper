Been working the same job since graduating in 2013, starting salary of 47k, now making around 105k at that company with 14k in side income. 66% of my majors graduating class ended up at the same company as me, although all but myself and one other have since moved on to other companies. Still, it\u2019s a fantastic program for getting a good job",

He maintains a massive network of alumni and emails everyone when one of their companies is hiring. You\u2019ll probably want to join the AITP club which he also leads, it looks great on resumes and is useful for networking as well. The career fair is extremely helpful, that\u2019s how I got my current job. I was hired six months prior to graduation and six years later I\u2019m still at that job",

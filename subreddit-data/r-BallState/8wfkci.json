That being said, all my home-stuff like doing school work/editing videos for fun/etc. have all been on my Windows desktop. Any insight?",

Unless you need the laptop to be physically be repaired, it will be \"free\" (part of the Technology Fees you'll be paying anyways). I will be a computer science sophomore next fall and personally a laptop wasn't entirely needed, it sometimes provided better quality of life. Do you know what programs are commonly used in your field, what operating system do they use, etc. Classes that frequently used computers have them in the room with any needed programs. What type of laptop shouldn't be based off of what is cheapest, it should be based off of what is best for you and your major, if needed at all. Laptops help, but most professors are pretty flexible if you don't have one (write on paper or turn in later, etc.)\n\n Since you have a computer that you are bringing then I would suggest waiting/talking with other TCOM majors/professors and see if you'll even need a laptop. You may try to find a group for Ball State TCOM and look or ask there. If you spend a lot of money on a laptop that you won't really use then you're out of most of that money, If you wait then you can buy through Tech Store (which provides a discount on Apple and Lenovo products). No need to financially strain yourself more than you need to.\n\ntl:dr: Choose a laptop that's the best match for you and your major (what programs you'll be using/know how to use). Professors are pretty flexible and will work with you. If you need tech help the Tech Center is in Bracken Library BL 101 and [bsu.edu/helpdesk](https://bsu.edu/helpdesk) You're already paying for it, might as well use it. ",

I\u2019ll definitely take your advice &amp; just start truckin\u2019 through with just my desktop, &amp; I\u2019ll hold on to my money until a laptop is a must-have.

Only issue is they are very expensive products, so I'd checked for a used copy when available.\n\nThat being said, you can definitely get by your first year or so without a laptop. There are desktops all over campus you can use to work with and if you do your notes with pad and paper you'll be just fine. Welcome to Ball State though! TCOM is fantastic here so you'll have all sorts of opportunity man.",

The best tip I can give you is to get involved with anything that interests you and pick two organizations or events you are gonna take seriously all year. That's how you start getting recommendations and network.\n\nI just moved in tonight myself. If ya need anyone to show ya around campus my PMs are always open :) But otherwise I hope it's everything you hope it to be and I hope you have a fantastic first year! Welcome to BSU!",

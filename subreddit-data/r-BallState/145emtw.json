    "postText": "So, I'll be attending Ball State this fall as a freshman. I was wondering which kind of computer I should buy for the specific majors/minors I'll be going into. I looked up some of the technical requirements and most of them say I should get a Mac book, but I'd like some information from some people who are actually attending too. Should I go for it and buy a Mac book, or would something else be better?",

You\u2019re able to download Office for free as a student, as well as Adobe Cloud, so don\u2019t buy any software ahead of time.",

I DIDN'T have Mac i had an ASUS laptop and was fine up until I started running my audio software \ud83d\ude05. \n\nSo maybe check and see if you have any software you need to get for your classes and what its minimum requirements to run it are before you buy, but that's your call.",

While I was attending, most of the computers on campus have just about all the software available on them for you to use, so even if you get an older computer that barely do the job. You should have the resources to work on whatever you need to do from just about anywhere on campus. And, most professors are usually helpful if you run into problems with technology.",

Normally I push business majors to purchase PCs because of their prevalence in offices of all kinds, but there are legitimately creative apps that simply are better on a Mac.\n\nIf you\u2019re doing finance or accounting, we really, really want you to have a PC, but I think if you\u2019re doing general business or another business discipline major, I think you\u2019ll be fine with the Mac.",

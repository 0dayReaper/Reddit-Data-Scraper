To add to this, I really don't like the dorm i'm in. I like to party, listen to music and chill. Any suggestions/advice would be helpful!",

Hung out a few times with some guys but it never really stuck, people had their own things going on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suggest trying a club. Join an intramural sport or an educational club, something like that. I moved to BSU and had zero friends. Had the most luck that way. ",

I sucked but everyone was always welcoming. The circles would form whenever and last for as long as people were around. I ended up making a lot of friends this way in lots of different groups with very different interests. I hope this helps. ",

An animation degree isn\u2019t necessary in the field. Your portfolio and it\u2019s contents are what really matter. And if you\u2019re capable of building those on your own thru gumroad, I\u2019d recommend that instead of coming to campus",

There are some large holes in the curriculum I think but it\u2019s also good to continue education outside of university course work too.\n\n It\u2019s also pretty competitive program just adding that too. \n\nMy favorite part is my classmates though.",

I also kinda wish we had an illustration course that could be taken beforehand cus I felt it would have helped as well.",

If it's the former, you'd probably be better doing some independent learning (including courses, reading, practice, etc.) and try to work in the field. If it's the latter, then yes, you'd probably want to get a degree.",

Nothing too difficult yet.

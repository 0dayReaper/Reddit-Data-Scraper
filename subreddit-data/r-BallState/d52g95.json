    "postText": "Hey there, \n\nI'm one of the staff photographers who works for the University. On the side, I also run my own photo business. Currently, I'm having a major sale on my portrait sessions to help build up a client base, since I moved from Kentucky when I took on my position here at the university. \n\nIf you're interested, please reach out. Prices are based on booked time starting at $35 for a mini-session. \n\nWebsite: http://bobbyellisphotos.net/portraits",

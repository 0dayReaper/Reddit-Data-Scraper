    "postText": "Please delete if not allowed but I am trying to get more information about a 20 year old BSU student, Dawn Marie VanMeter, who was murdered in 1982. She was found in Marquette Park lagoon in Gary and had been strangled. The last thing I can find about her in the news archives is a possible suspect in 1983 but nothing after that. Does anyone in here know anything about this case or know where I could maybe find more information other than the local newspaper archives? Any help or info would be greatly appreciated!",

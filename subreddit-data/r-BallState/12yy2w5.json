    "postText": "Hi, I was looking at the Roommate search thing that you can access via the housing portal, and it seems quite empty. I am going to be living in a dorm, but there isn't a whole lot of people on that roommate search. Is there somewhere else I should be looking, or am I early for it? Or maybe that's just all the people who care, but I figured more people would want to select their own roommate.",

I just feel like im missing something cause there's only like 10 people on there for my major, but maybe im expecting too much or am too early. I am an art major so, maybe that's why, I don't know. I am just going off the assumption there would be more than 10 people who have put their profile on there.   \n\n\nAlso did you just use your ball state email to contact them, or something else?",

I personally love my HP Spectre which are about the same as Macs, but I can turn mine into a drawing tablet and all my friends with Macs love my laptop. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Some of the programs they use are pretty demanding. A good MAC will work too but I\u2019m not sure what some good specs are (not an apple user)",

Both MSI and Lenovo make decent gaming laptops that aren't too expensive (at least in terms of gaming laptops). I would check with which specific architecture program he's planning on going into, because each one might have different requirements.",

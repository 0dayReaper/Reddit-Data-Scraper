    "postText": "Hello everyone. I\u2019m an incoming freshman and as I near move in day. I was wondering if anyone has had bad experiences with bike lockers. I\u2019m an avid mountain biker and was wondering if this would be a way for me to bring my bike to school. But if it\u2019s not too secure I will just leave it for the few months I\u2019m gone. Thanks",

Only used my bike during the day/to classes, so it was during daylight and never got messed with. Nice having that piece of mind at night that it was safely locked up. Never had an issue.\n\nEdit: Posted not in a bragging way, just the point that I had a bike that I valued greatly (that was also greatly valued) and that I relied on the locker, which did it's job.",

There are a few residence halls that have bike rooms that keep the bikes out of the weather, but they are still freely accessible to anyone. For what it's worth, I had no issues with a simple bike lock outside. What dorm are you going to be in?",

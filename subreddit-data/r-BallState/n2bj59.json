I am an out-of-state graduate student who finished his master\u2019s last year and I have made plans to attend the class of 2020 commencement in-person\u2026all the way from merry ol\u2019 Utah. \n\nAs another commenter mentioned, you deserve to be recognized. Maybe you\u2019ll end up going for your family who will get to watch on YouTube because you couldn\u2019t be there for them emotionally because you were dedicated to school. Maybe you\u2019ll end up going with your best friends who you have convinced to fly out with you to exotic Muncie because you had to neglect them for two years so you could turn in those papers by 9:59:59 PM MST. Maybe you\u2019ll go for a significant other who had to put up with your whining throughout school and who you forced to listen to you talk about the importance of always reporting effect size in addition to p-values until they died of boredom.\n\nBut, you owe it to yourself, most importantly, to walk across that stage when they call your name and put that metaphorical exclamation point at the end of your Ball State experience.\n\nYou did it!\n\nYou did it during a pandemic.\n\nBe proud of your accomplishments.\n\nI am proud of you and I don\u2019t even know you. But I hope you\u2019ll be there too.",

You deserve to be recognized, especially after the past couple of years!",

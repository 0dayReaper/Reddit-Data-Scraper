    "postText": "Any tour guides in here?? My sister is a senior in high school and is doing a visit (or is scheduling a visit soon) and she plans on majoring in nursing. Is there a way to get a tour of the new nursing college?? Idk what the rules are with covid right now \n\nPS: I\u2019ve graduated undergrad and currently doing my masters here so I could give her a detailed tour but wanted to know specifically about nursing \n\nThanks!",

Try this instead: https://www.youvisit.com/tour/60107",

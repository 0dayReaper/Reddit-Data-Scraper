I am already enrolled in 12 credit hours so I\u2019m hoping to find some easy stuff to jump into.  I\u2019m open to pretty much any topic.  Does anyone have any recommendations?",

Discussion based \nSPCE 200 was an A for me but it was a lot of work for an elective. \nHSC 180 was decently easy but also requires you to do some community service (10 hours I think)",

Dad and I both live out of town(New Orleans and Huron, SD respectively) and use the upstairs unit as a sort of timeshare between us so there\u2019s not a lot of noise from us stomping around. \nIf any of y\u2019all aren't happy with your housing situation let me know. We aren\u2019t slumlords and don\u2019t mind the normal college shenanigans. PM me if you want to see it, I\u2019ll be escaping the summer heat next Monday and can show it to you in person!",

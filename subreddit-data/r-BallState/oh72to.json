A dorm is going to be filled with different kinds of people who you'll be friends with. Just find one close to most of your classes that's cheapest and pick a room.",

I\u2019d suggest taking a look at the campus map to see where all the dorms are on campus.",

It used to be the LLC for Humanities, but that was moved to the North West. If you would prefer to live with people that have similar majors, then North West Hall would be a great option for you. If you just want to make friends, then Stu East will be great for that!",

So I initially got an old Mac book for the first two years but the farther I got in, the more I realized Mac just isn\u2019t worth the price and trouble with what programs are available. \n\nI just recently switched over to a windows laptop and it\u2019s made everything so much smoother. The only benefit I can see to a Mac is the ability to program in Swift but honestly entering college, Swift is probably the last thing to focus on for now since it\u2019s so niche. \n\nMake whatever choice feels best but my suggestion is just get a modest windows laptop and you\u2019ll be good to go!",

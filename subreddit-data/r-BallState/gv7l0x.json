You're going to get a revolt, especially from graduate students.\n\nI know most people here in this sub are undergrad, but I think people here forget how much grad students need access to the school itself to work.\n\nFurthermore, most of us are funded by assistantships and fellowships. If there's no school, most of us will be out of work, and no work means no funding.\n\nBall State for a lot of us isn't just studying and researching, it's also our place of work as well. \n\nJust my two cents.\n\nP.S. However, I did wish Ball State waited to demolish the rest of Lafollette so we can use that to spread out more students.\n\nIndiana is only allowing 1 person per dorm room this year. That's a good compromise I think.\n\nLastly, they should have allowed people who wanted to stay online. Not offering online classes, but allowing in-person classes to have the ability to be online for high-risk people.",

But I thought I read somewhere it wasn\u2019t completely getting demolished just yet. So maybe that\u2019s what they will do. \n\nLove hearing everyone\u2019s theories",

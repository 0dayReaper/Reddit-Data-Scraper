    "postText": "So I have a friend who lives on the 4th floor who says that sometimes in the middle of the night there will be loud knocks on specific doors that wake everyone up. This happens almost everynight. Students on the floor acuse eachother of knocking on the doors. Its gotten so bad that the RA had to call a floor meeting to tell that whoever was doing it to stop. But it hasnt stopped. According to the RA this has been a problem with the 4th floor every year. Apparently there has also been a lot of suicides on the 4th floor aswell which has led some students to believe its haunted. Does anyone else know anything about this?",

Some asshole is going around knocking on people's doors. The only people who annoyed me were the smoking section that was located outside my window where people would yell and scream up until 2 or 3 a.m. ",

And the people spreading that rumor also have no way of backing it up, given that it would have been public info. However, I did always hear that the 6th floor lounge was haunted. Two years ago it was pretty spooky when I would spend late nights up there to study.",

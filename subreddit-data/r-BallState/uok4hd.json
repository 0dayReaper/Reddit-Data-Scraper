    "postText": "My GPA is currently a 3.2. I\u2019m not submitting my SAT score because it\u2019s below the average and I can\u2019t imagine it would help my case. I\u2019m wondering how high of a chance I have at getting in if I have a lot of work experience and a decent amount of extra curricular relating to the field I\u2019m trying to pursue.  \n\nI know if I retook my SAT, did a semester at IUSB, finished high school with great grades and did community service type things as well as apply early I could probably get in. But as it stands, do you think I have a decent chance or should I keep my expectations low?\n\nUpdate: I got in \u263a\ufe0f",

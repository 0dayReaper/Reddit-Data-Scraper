Gen eds are important freshman year, but make sure to have at least a few major-oriented classes so you can get a feel for it and see if you like your major (just in case)",

Establishing good habits your first semester can help you live a healthier lifestyle for years to come. I think it\u2019s PFW 100, but somebody else can correct me if I\u2019m wrong.",

I am now a senior and am only now realizing that putting off consistent exercise is just putting me behind in life. If you have no experience in the gym, the class is just a place to start. I personally use an app called FitBod so that I don't have to mess around with figuring out what to do in the gym. Also, MyFitnessPal for calorie tracking. Might as well make a habit of it now.",

The advisor you meet with during orientation may have their own opinions on what the best courses are your first semester. \n\nI would agree with another commenter that completing your PFW requirement as early as possible is ideal. A LOT of students put it off and then it can put your graduation in jeopardy if you procrastinate and then all the sections are full your senior year. (I used to work for this dept and it was a common issue.)",

That was a fun and relaxing class and a great stress reliever in the middle of a very stressful semester.",

If there are future classes that you know will be more difficult, I\u2019d balance out the difficult with some UCC classes because most of those were fairly easy (COMM210, ART/DANC100, PFW credit, etc). In my earlier semesters, I took 2-3 UCC classes and 2-3 major-required classes per semester depending on availability and difficulty of major classes.",

The common tactic was to plan to \"drop\" the honors college after your sophomore year (they wouldn't tell their advisor, of course) so that you could stay in the honors college dorm (tight knit, a lot of fun, nice location, etc.) after which they were ready to move off campus anyway. Academically, the honors program doesn't have many upsides while still requiring a workload, and most people don't think is ultimately worth the effort.\n\nIf you have the luxury of choosing your dorm at any point, I highly recommend choosing Park. I stayed there my sophomore year and am convinced it is the best all around dorm by far. The newest dorms are nice, but unbelievably crowded (for food and bus stops) and in a horrible location compared to Deho/Woodworth/Park for events/classes/hang out spots imo. Also, you wouldn't live directly next to/above a Starbucks (which stays open later than food, total BS) to help prevent feeding your soon to be developed caffeine addiction and discourage you from getting a 18oz 500mg caffeine injected concoction at midnight every night. It's fun off and on for like a year and then you realize that inadvertantly destroying your sleep schedule isn't worth it.",

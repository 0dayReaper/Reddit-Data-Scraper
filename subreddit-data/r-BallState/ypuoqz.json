    "postText": "I'm a transfer student who recently got admitted to Ball State for Fall of 2023, but the Transfer department estimates it'll be at least January before the college finds out how my credits transfer, so I'm trying to avoid committing before then. Is it likely that there'll be any University Apartment 1 bedrooms still available for rent by then? For either Anthony or Scheidler?\n\nI've heard that the dorms have tons of room, but I'd prefer to avoid those if possible.",

It will be a lot cheaper, there are shuttles to and from campus (muncie isn\u2019t that big anyway and it\u2019s like a 10-15 minute ride), they have nicer amenities like pools and bon fires and more space in general.",

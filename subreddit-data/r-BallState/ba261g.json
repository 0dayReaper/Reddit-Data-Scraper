I was thinking something along the lines of a session outside by all of the notable Ball State landmarks.  Does anybody who to go to and what prices should I expect? Thank you.",

I think you can expect to pay anywhere from 70-150 depending on the photographer and their experience, and you should receive at least 20-50+ edited photos I'd say.",

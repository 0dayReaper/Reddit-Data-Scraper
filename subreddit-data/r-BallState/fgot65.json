Seems to be the main concern on the faculty side are exams and how they will be proctored. Lots of talk about potentially using Examity. Also been a lot of talks about other student workers and their wages and some of those jobs that have been essentially eliminated because of the changes. The faculty is just as in the dark as we are as students, and are asking questions. Seems to be a big deal to them, which I am happy about, because they are asking questions and actively looking out for us. If you're a student worker and have heard anything, let us know under this comment.",

Wishing you peace and clarity in these difficult times.",

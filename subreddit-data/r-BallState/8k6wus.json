    "postText": "Just what the title says. My roommate got a job and is leaving. You can move in anytime, but preferably before July. Rent is $262.50/mo for your half ($525 total) and water is included. Utilities hover around $160/mo total (~$80 each). \n\nYou need to be okay with pets but otherwise I'm really easy to get along with. I'm either in the lab, doing something outdoors, or playing video games. I've attached a link to my post on Facebook for the place. I actually really love my cheap little apartment and the location is nice because I like being near the river and parks and still walking distance from campus.\n\nFeel free to message me on here or FB if interested.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1602401763377335/permalink/2088636868087153/?sale_post_id=2088636868087153",

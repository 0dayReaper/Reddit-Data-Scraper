    "postText": "Hello, I have been looking for a while for an apartment that can be leased near the end of May/start of June. Most that I've seen are for the start of August, but I don't know if that's set in stone or not. So, I am wondering if this is possible or likely. Preferably I'd want one bedroom with rent to be around $500. This may be too specific, but I have an internship in June that I need an apartment for.\n\nIf any of you have any recommendations please let me know.",

You may have to do 2 leases one for the academic year and another for summer. I'm not entirely sure how it works, but I would recommend looking into it.",

I am currently leasing it, but I\u2019m looking to break it just because I\u2019m moving to Indianapolis. You could take over the lease starting in June and then resign and stay from August until July of 2022. If you\u2019re interested let me know, I\u2019d be glad to give you my number or email to give you more info.",

They\u2019re not the newest but they put a lot of work into making them livable and they\u2019re very affordable. Only real drawback is they\u2019re in downtown so there would be a small commute to campus, but the central MITS bus station won\u2019t be too far of a walk. I highly recommend at the very least checking them out and finding out what they have available.",

            "comment": "In my experience, his classes start out almost unfairly difficult (as an example, on my the first exam I took with him I set the curve with like a 30% and we got some of the hardest projects I remember having in undergrad) but by the end of the semester it swung to the other extreme. I remember studying for hours and hours for the final of the class, only to come in and have it be a seven question multiple choice exam that I finished in less than a minute. I don't think we had any homework whatsoever the last third of the semester. The subjects he teaches are really tough conceptually, so be ready for that. He does teach some pretty interesting stuff though (we did a unit on functional programming, which was pretty cool). You shouldn't have any issue passing, although your grade might start out pretty low.",

            "comment": "I had him during the covid semester (Spring 2020) for Programming Languages. It started off okay, he gave us a couple assignments and we had a midterm, though he still seemed a bit disorganized in that he didn't have a syllabus and some of the midterm questions were on things we hadn't covered in class. Covid hit right after the midterm and we all moved online. He sent us a few emails about assignments that he would supposedly be releasing soon, and then proceeded to ghost us until the week before finals week. That week, he let us know that he would be releasing a couple of quizzes the following week in addition to the final exam (which were essentially useless since we hadn't covered any more material since the midterm??). The next week, he sends out another email stating that he wasn't aware he wasn't allowed to assign any regular assignments during finals week (this man served as the chair of the CS department for OVER TWO DECADES) and thus would only be releasing the final exam. The exam was a joke, a bunch of stuff from the midterm combined with some harder questions that were never covered in class or in assignments. So yeah, not the best professor. Honestly I think he's really smart, he's just disorganized and not the best communicator, which are necessary things to be a decent instructor. I would avoid him if you can.",

            "comment": "I had him as a professor for programming languages last year, literally the worst class I've ever taken. Class was online, he sent us maybe two announcements the entire semester, he randomly posted 4 assignments one day and then took 2 months to grade half of them, the other half of the class to my knowledge never even got grades for them. Gave us 0 direction for the assignments anyway so it didn't really matter. Ended up getting a B for the class for literally no reason, there wasn't even a final, just didn't have the energy to argue for anything better, he never responded to anyones emails or anything so we would have to contact the department head if we wanted something done, which I think a few people did. He literally signed up to teach the class then went on vacation for an entire semester. Kinda sad the class sounds fun and I was excited to take it based on the description, I'm sure he's a nice guy and he's probably very smart, but he clearly didn't give a fuck about the class he signed up to teach, complete waste of time and money.",

In the 2nd semester class they had a project due just before mid terms, and said he'd have them graded in a week or two. A few weeks out from finals, he asked when their projects would be graded and he said \"Right after I get done grading your projects from last semester.\"\n\nKind of funny, but also sad.",

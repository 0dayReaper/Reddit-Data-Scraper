    "postText": "So I was recently admitted to the MA in Linguistics program at Ball State. I have decided that I will move to Muncie this fall, as even though my classes are online, I am not sure what will happen in the spring. I have two things I want to ask about in this post:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Is there anyone else here studying Linguistics or any foreign langauges at BS? If so, I'd love to link up. I know Russian (I taught English in Russia for 8 months) as well as Persian-Farsi and a little bit of Japanese (would like to work more on that).\n2. I am thinking about the following apartment complexes:\n   1. Silvertree (cheap and not too far from campus, I don't mind the walk)\n   2. University apartments (well-renovated from what I've discerned)\n   3. Varisty House (more expensive but very well-renovated, I can handle the price hike)\n   4. Cardinal Pointe\n   5. Sugarbush (farther away but I can bike if need be)\n\nI have heard that I should avoid The Haven. Is this true? Are there any others I should look into?\n\nThank you all for your help.",

            "comment": "Check out beacon hill. Im an incoming MA-SLP grad student and looked into all the apartments you listed. I learned that some Silvertree 5 star reviews were due to entry giveaways (aka rate us a 5 star review and get entered for free rent) they also have \u201ccommunal electricity\u201d meaning you don\u2019t pay for what you personally use, you pay for the average use for the whole building.... I hear university apartments are great- but I called and they are limited. Sugarbush was in a good area of town but I drove past there and it looked a little run down compared to walnut manor/VP/Forrest oaks.... hope this helps. I chose beacon hill due to it being safe on campus and quick+friendly staff. They have 3 bed townhomes and 2 bedroom apartments.",

The rent is bumped to $900 for a two person but they are renovating every apartment so the apartments are really nice now and it\u2019s in a really nice location that allows you to walk to campus easily but there\u2019s also a campus bus service like 100 yards away",

            "comment": "Varsity house is nice but has a few issues. You get matched with people by survey questions. You have semester end inspections. And dExpending what floor and room, the walls can be super thin. They say gated community but the gates are never locked. The bedrooms have heard-boards attached to the walls that can\u2019t be moved.  \n\n\nHowever, the staff are amazing and super friendly, they are very quick with helping you with any issues you may have. They offer free internet and cable, and allow you to use the clubhouse printer for free. They are upgrading apartments, so hopefully you won\u2019t have well used furniture. The closets and bathrooms are huge, you could put a twin bed in the closet and still have plenty of room for clothes and other items.",

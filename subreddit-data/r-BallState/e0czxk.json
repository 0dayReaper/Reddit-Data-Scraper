I\u2019m looking at transferring into the business college, more specifically supply chain management. What is the quality of the business school here and what has been your experience with Ball State in general? I really appreciate any information you guys can give to me.",

My regret is I never went to a football game while I was a student but I did go to a ton of basketball games. \n\nIt can have a reputation as a party school but just don\u2019t lose your head and focus on your studies.\n\nI grew up in Muncie and went to k-12 on bsu campus as well, so it\u2019s a nice campus, bracken library is a fantastic study spot and source of information, and while it\u2019s a larger school than some, the professors all truly care about their students.",

            "comment": "There's a supply chain club that does really cool things for people in that major. I know recently they went on a tour of Allison transmission in Indy. My roommate is in it and talks very highly of it. There's also plenty of other business groups on campus that can help you grow in the business field. If you want to pm me about any of the groups I'd be happy to help!\nI started out in business as my major but eventually decided it wasn't for me. But while I was in the major the group I joined helped me feel welcomed. I'm still a part of it so I can help others get the best out of their education, plus all my best friends are in it.",

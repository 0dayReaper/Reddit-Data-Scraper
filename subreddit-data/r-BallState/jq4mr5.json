            "comment": "Hi there, I\u2019m looking for a roommate for a 2 bedroom 1 bath unit at Anthony Apartments on campus. We would each have our own room and share the bathroom, living room, and kitchen. Rent and all utilities for each month would come to around $405 at the most. It\u2019s nice because it is through the school. You can choose how long you need to stay, and it can be by semester. You would apply and request me as your roommate and then you pay rent to the school by month. I\u2019m moving in at the beginning of January and plan to stay for a couple years.

    "postText": "I rent through nicebsurentals. I wish i never did ngl. Its a rent by room technically but they only rent to groups which is fine. I have two other roommates and one is from hell. We have been told more than once theyd be evicted and it never happened, now the landlord is refusing to let them out of the lease /sublease bc they dont trust them. Its put myself and the third roomie in a spot as now we have to cover their utilises and the landlord doesnt care. Dont rent from them. I thought I could last the lease but now im moving out early and putting myself in debt bc my landlord would rather try and make full rent from the three of us and believe a junkie over the two of us saying its not safe. \n\nLesson learned:\nDONT RENT FROM NICEBSURENTALS",

We would then scuttle back and forth when the RA would come to bust our parties.  We had enough clothes in the closet they would open it to try to find someone, but couldn't see the back of it.  Got away with it until someone else did it and got caught, narced us out.  4th floor Edwards Hall.   1988.",

Honestly I\u2019d recommend just getting a small studio or apartment if you were to spend the money but if you want to live in the dorms, do what feels best! If you want to skip Lafollete and Johnson, I\u2019d look at Noyer as that\u2019s much easier to get into, I knew a few freshman when I first came here that got rooms there",

My experience from Lafollete, the WiFi was okay but the Ethernet was awful since the technology hadn\u2019t been upgraded since it was installed but as someone mentioned, that dorm won\u2019t be around much longer. I\u2019d feel confident saying the rest of the dorms have good internet, I spent a ton of time in Noyer with friends and I didn\u2019t have connectivity issues. If all you\u2019re doing is watching Netflix/gaming/browsing, you\u2019ll be fine for sure!",

You\u2019ll also be right above probably one of the better food courts so that\u2019s always nice too. The rooms are decent sized Id say and usually include a private sink with a shared bathroom. \n\nI\u2019m not a fan of the ball state website at all since I feel like tons of links are broken. They\u2019ve never really done dorm summaries from what I know but on YouTube they have dorm tours that will show off what a usual room will look like",

DeHo is pretty much mandatory for all freshman honors college kids. However, I have heard that Johnson is maybe the best because of the room layout (actual closet) and also I believe it is Air Conditioned. Communal bathrooms though. I think the only dorms with semi-private bathrooms are Park, DeHo, and Kinghorn. Park and Kinghorn are almost exclusively for non-freshmen though. Hope this helps!",

            "comment": "I lived in Lafollette my freshman and sopore year.  Woody/shales for my freshman year.  It's gone now but the rooms were actually decent sized.  I got lucky and my roommate moved out so I had two closets, two beds, two desks, and two dressers to do whatever I wanted with.  Lived in Shively my sophomore year.  Dorms were smaller but I lived in a single and it was just OK.  Studebaker West for my Junior year and again I lived in a single.  The AC was great but fuck the bathrooms. People are gross lol.  Shively has private or semi private bathrooms if you live above a certain floor.  Can't remember what floor those start at but I lived in the 3rd and had a small communal bathroom.  StuWest is communal.  Haven't lived in the other dorms but imo Park is the best from what I experienced but it's more expensive than the other dorms.  \n\nI live off campus now and that's probably the best option but for freshman dorms are kinda required unless you meet certain requirements.  I'm kind of excited to see what the new buildings will look like when they're finished.  Whatever dorm you, try to make the best of it.  Lafollette sucked but I ended up not being as miserable as I thought I would be.",

            "comment": "The best dorm is no dorm. Live on campus your first year for the experience and get the hell out of there. Johnson is where I lived. I believe they're the smallest rooms on campus, but it's one of the newest facilities and it's air conditioned. Plus I really enjoyed the students living there.\n\nBut like I said before, live off campus as soon as you possibly can. DO NOT SIGN FOR PREMIUM PLAN. It's an absolute scam. Muncie is one of the most affordable college towns in America, so take advantage of that. Living off campus will save you about 30k in loans (that is if you're doing loans and aren't a 21st century scholar or something like that). Look around at some of the houses/condos/apartments available for rent around here; there's options for every kind of budget. But avoid BSU rentals. I've heard terrible things. Welcome to BSU!",

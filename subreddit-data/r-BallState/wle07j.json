Not all devices support this, so it might be a good idea to look up whether your specific switch or Alexa model does.",

Ball State wants you to input Wi-Fi credentials on a web page, but because the Switch doesn't have an Internet browser, you just get a blank white screen instead of the login. \n\nI've hooked the Switch up to the dock and connected the dock to Ethernet - that works perfectly, but you need a TV for it and you can't use Internet in handheld mode.\n\nMaybe things are different this year, but I doubt it. Hope this helped.",

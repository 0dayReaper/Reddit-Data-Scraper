    "postText": "Hello, I am curious to know if Ball State will be switching to online classes? After about two weeks in I'm seeing alot of students getting sick from covid. I'm doing the best I can to stay safe and wear my mask, I have tried to get as many classes online as possible and not leave my dorm room that often other than for in person classes and dinning. Perhaps this is anecdotal but the numbers are really concerning to me. \n\nThanks.",

Begin to look at the problem through the lens of how they can best fuck you and still make money off of you and you'll find university conduct begins to make a lot more sense.  I don't see us going online again until they can be sure they've made all their housing money.",

Sadly I and my roommates suspect that Ball State won't go online for a couple of weeks so they don't have to pay a housing refund to the students in the dorms. Of course, we have already surpassed all of the fall semester in terms of cases just in a couple of weeks. This is not taking into account that Ball State only counts the Ball memorial and health center tests meaning the numbers are much higher than what Ball State reports. So it is wildly irresponsible of the university to ignore these numbers to save money from giving refunds. I know a lot of staff are not happy that the university is not going online as they feel like their safety is in danger.",

Severe illness IS preventable if you talk to your Doctor before simply letting the school throw you in quarantine. But what WON'T prevent severe disease is masks, social distancing, or remote learning. We need to stop living in fear, and take off the masks.",

Because they prevent the rapid spread of airborne pathogens to those with health issues. Health issues that cannot be helped with vitamins.\n\nI understand your skepticism, but I hope you come to understand that these methods are effective ways of dealing with disease. Think about how you were told to wash your hands back in elementary school. It's not a form of oppressive control, it's learning how other people keep the ones around them healthy. I think we can both agree that taking care of the people around us is our civic duty. And that civic duty in these times is to prevent the spread of a pathogen by wearing masks. I dislike wearing masks, but my intent to protect others mixed with a nice looking, comfortable mask makes it much easier to do. Hey, make it a fashion statement if you're into that.\n\nIf you miss seeing people's faces, I get that. I have a hard time recognizing faces and emotions behind masks! But you can think of it as an opportunity to learn how to read peoples' emotions based just from their eyes and brows. It sounds weird, but believe me when I say it can be quite interesting! If you yourself want to emote more with a mask on, I would encourage being more expressive with your eyes, brows and eye lids. Maybe throw some body language in there too! Always try to put a postive spin on things. It makes stuff easier.\n\nHope that helps a little. Here's some links to cited and first-hand resources regarding your concerns:\n\nWhy masks?

Wearing a mask IS about control! The control of spreading disease!\n\nI genuinely hope you don't diregard this. I'm sorry you were coaxed into the conclusion you did about mask wearing and social distancing. There's a lot of confusing information out there haha. Yeah this situation we all are stuck in sucks. Yeah our mental health isn't great. But by working as a campus-wide(and hopefully world-wide) community of educated individuals, we can protect the bodily health of all our neighbors together :)",

Not an everyday thing, but rather to wear when we get sick. Eastern countries have been doing this for ages as a courtesy to others. I know I will be doing this because I know I don\u2019t want to be breathing in another persons cough air, so I won\u2019t be doing that gross thing to someone else. \n\nHowever it will take quite some time to get to that point unfortunately. We are still facing devastating waves of strains right now making it unwise to drop mask mandates. Again, I fully promote listening to your doctor. Maybe they would be able to give you some reassurance about this. Also, look back at the pandemic that occurred back in the early 1900\u2019s and do research to see how long it took them to recover and return to normalcy. They wore masks then too!\n\nOnce we get past the worst strains and more people get vaxxed, I think the number of outbreaks should decline. The biggest concern right now is the strain on hospitals. Once we see long enough of a grace period infection-wise, we can rest. It\u2019s all in due time.",

    "postText": "[VOTER REGISTRATION ONLINE](http://www.indianavoters.com/)\n\nMUST REGISTER BY OCTOBER 5TH\n\nStudents may only register at one of two places:\n\n1. The address where they live while attending school; OR\n\n2. The address where they live while not attending school\n\nNOTE: the intent of where students plan to return after attending college, or during summer and winter breaks, is not to be factored into the decision to approve their registration. They may register at school, if they so choose.\n\nIF YOU ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE IN YOUR HOME TOWN (if in Indiana) YOU NEED TO FILL OUT AN ABSENTEE REQUEST TO VOTE BY MAIL. Otherwise you will need to drive home to vote.\n\nDeadline to register for absentee voting is October 22nd.\n\n[ABSENTEE REQUEST](https://forms.in.gov/Download.aspx?id=8691)\n\n**However, WE DON'T KNOW if college will still be in person in November, and it's possible that schools get sent home AFTER the absentee deadline but BEFORE the election, so to make sure you can vote, you should probably register in your home town then request an absentee ballot.**\n\nIndiana is big on \"proof of where you live\" so during registration you need to provide proof, or you need to include proof with your ballot.  If you \n\n\"A first time voter in Indiana who registered to vote by mail and did not provide proof of residency will be asked to include that evidence with their absentee balloting materials. This can be a state-issued ID where the address matches their registration, but can also be a bank statement, utility bill, etc.\"  It's probably a good idea to include a copy of your driver's license or bank statement or some kind of bill (addressed to your home town address) in the mail in ballot to prevent your ballot being denied.  Yes, this is super biased against college students, because you don't have any bills in your name.  A copy of your driver's license is probably your best bet.\n\n**A voter needs to file an absentee application before each election for which the individual wants to vote absentee-by-mail.**\n\n\n You have the right to vote in Indiana if:\n\n* You are both a U.S. citizen and a resident of Indiana; and\n* You will be at least 18 years of age on or before the next General or Municipal Election, and\n* You are not currently in prison after being convicted of a crime; and\n* You have lived in the precinct where you vote for at least 30 days prior to the election; and\n* You are registered to vote.",

It's expected that a lot of the volunteers won't turn out this year due to the risk of Coronavirus.\n\nAlso you can request an absentee ballot if you expect to be confined to your home due to illness, which I think includes a lot of people due to coronavirus so even though we don't have widespread mail in voting you can still apply for absentee.",

This probably explains why..\n\n[71% of college students plan to vote in 2020\u2014and they heavily prefer Biden over Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/71percent-of-college-students-plan-to-voteand-they-prefer-biden-over-trump.html)\n\nStudents away from home have to jump through a lot more hoops to vote.

No matter where you fall in the political spectrum, there's too much going on in the US and the rest of the world to not vote.  \n\nCollege aged individuals are the ones who are going to be living with the policies that are happening now.  Make your voice heard!  Don't let your parents and grandparents' generations make those decisions for you.  \n\nAlso, look into Ranked Choice voting.  If it looks appealing, email your state representatives.  This is a potential solution to the restrictive nature of the two party system we're currently trapped in.",

If you don\u2019t like what\u2019s going on in Muncie, your home town, or your home state (whether that\u2019s Indiana or elsewhere) then do something about it. Register to vote, confirm you\u2019re registered to vote, and vote.",

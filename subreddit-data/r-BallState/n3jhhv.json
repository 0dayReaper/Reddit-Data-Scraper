All of the people I knew that were in one were friends with most of the people on their floor. Everyone else moving in will be in a similar situation as you as they dont really know anyone else either, so as long as you are sociable with your floor mates you shouldnt have trouble finding people you like.",

            "comment": "As other people have said, clubs are by far the best way to meet lifelong friends. You'll find that, since BSU is such a small community compared to other universities, the friends who you make within your interest group will invite you to discover their other interests, and that will just continue to happen. I was involved in the fencing club, the UGL, and the Smash club, and I made friends from all majors and walks of life that I am pretty sure are going to stay in my life. So yeah, join clubs that you find interesting, chances are it will really open up your social horizons.",

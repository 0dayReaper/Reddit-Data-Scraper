Decent view, not many people walking through. \n\nThere are spots in the library in the stacks that are great too, find a corner somewhere in a higher floor.\n\nUnethical: piggy back into a residence hall and cry in the first unlocked, empty room you find. Leave a thank you note and a warning to lock their door.",

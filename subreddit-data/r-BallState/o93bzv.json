It belongs to me, and it wasn't cool for you to walk into my yard and steal it. Just put it back where it was and we'll say no more about it.  \n\nAlso, bring back the other pot you stole from the front porch.  \n\nYou were seen by a few people, but I don't want to make a big thing out of this. Just put it all back, and that will be the end of it.",

Sorry to hear about your plant and pots. \n\nIn my opinion, if they have already stolen one of your pots, they probably won\u2019t think much of a Reddit post asking to bring back another thing they\u2019ve stolen from you unfortunately. I\u2019d recommend either confronting them face to face (and after that involving the fuzz if they continue down their bad path). \n\nI hope your plants are doing well with this rain!",

My remaining plants enjoyed the rain.\n\nI got a look at the girls today and I'm pretty sure I know where they live, but I really don't want to make a thing out of it. I especially wouldn't want to get the law involved. If the cops bust them, then you start talking about prosecution for theft and criminal trespass and all sorts of things that aren't good to have on your record. I'm older than they are and I have done a lot of stupid things in my life, and I believe in giving people as many second chances as I can. I've benefited from quite a few second chances myself.\n\nThe things you steal never give you as much pleasure as the things that are really yours. When you look at a thing you've stolen, you have to force yourself to have a blind spot about why you have it. You have to tell yourself a little story to justify why it's yours, and you always feel a little bit bad, no matter how much you try to ignore it.\n\nIf they bring my stuff back, they will feel better. Guaranteed. If not, a little part of them will rot inside, and it will never go away. All of us have rotten spots, but we should try to avoid them, and avoid inflicting them on others.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve just been admitted as a transfer student to Ball State for this summer semester and I currently live two hours away from Muncie. Can anyone recommend a way to find independent landlords around Muncie? \n\nI\u2019m looking for a 2 bed/1 bath apartment or house (my younger sister and I plan to live together) available nowish or this April/May. \n\nI\u2019ve read bad things about the BSUrentals and Middletown property management companies, so I\u2019m trying to explore options besides them. Also is BSUcampusrentals different or also owned by BSUrentals? \n\nAny other advice is also greatly appreciated!",

They do several different weekly service projects that are at different times, so it's pretty easy to find something you're interested in that will fit your schedule. Some of these include sorting food at Second Harvest Food Bank, helping out at the Muncie Animal Shelter, and organizing at the Back to School Teachers Store. Rides are provided from campus. \n\nAs for the meetings, they are weekly and there is often either a service project or a game of some sort to get to know people. There are also socials outside of meetings and service. Steak n Shake is the #1 place for Circle K-ers lol. But sometimes they go to Friday Night Filmworks or to different events in Muncie. There are even socials with other clubs, like going to Christmas at the Zoo with IUPUI.\n\nOh! And there are district conventions a couple times a year. These are an awesome way to get to meet people from other clubs, too.\n\nIf you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask! I was a member for four years and absolutely loved it. I can also get you in touch with the leadership team if you want. They are awesome people!",

I\u2019ve gotten great haircuts there for $20-25. \n\nA lot of people I know swear by RedHead, but I haven\u2019t had good experiences there. They give off a real \u201cmean girls\u201d vibe and I think are very pretentious about their products and services. It\u2019s $40-60 for a haircut before tip and they will try HARD to upsell their products to you. \n\nI\u2019ve been to Hot Heads, as well, but the stylist I really liked moved away. The next stylist I had there effed up my haircut and cut it like 3\u201d shorter than I wanted. \n\nI\u2019ve had nothing but great experiences at twisted scissors, though. Cynthia is great!!",

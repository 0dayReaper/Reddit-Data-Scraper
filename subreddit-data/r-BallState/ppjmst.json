    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m Maloney, I\u2019m a Sophomore with the School of Music (Music Education) and I\u2019m looking for someone to hang out with on Wednesday or Thursday afternoons. I\u2019m terrible at smalltalk but my interests include aeronautics and space, animal biology (especially marine), history, paleontology, anthropology, sociology, film, comics, poetry, physics, chemistry, math, philosophy, religion, painting, knitting, science fiction, Jazz, Bluegrass, Country, Hip-Hop, Metal, Barbershop, and any topic musical in nature. I\u2019m an extrovert but I\u2019m quiet and also don\u2019t have much time for meeting people.\n\nI\u2019m free Wednesday and Friday at noon and Wednesday and Thursday after five. If you\u2019re interested in catching dinner or lunch or just want to chat about your hobbies/interests, feel free to DM me!",

    "postText": "I am an international student at Ball State and in the process of getting my driver's license. I have to log in 50 hours of driving before I can take the test but I don't have any family or friends here so it's difficult for me to find someone to practice driving with (I also cannot afford to pay driving school for all 50 hours). Any suggestions on how do I go about this?",

I wrote down everything and I basically didn\u2019t do much driving but I did pass and all I did was write down an exaggerated amount of hours and I turned it in. They didn\u2019t ask me, they didn\u2019t second guess. The bmv can be very nerve racking but don\u2019t let that get to you. Driving is easy it\u2019s basically common sense. If you need feel free to message me on anything.",

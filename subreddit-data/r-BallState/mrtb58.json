    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman planning on living on campus and I was wondering if there are any good places to skate in Muncie and on campus.  I\u2019m mostly looking for a tennis court or a park with nice smooth roads to skate on.  I\u2019m also trying to get into skateparks if anybody has any suggestions.  I\u2019d also love a skating buddy if anybody else roller skates!",

No clue about the skateparks unfortunately",

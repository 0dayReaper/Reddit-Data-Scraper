Our health oriented ones are very hit or miss with how many people are coming. \n\nWhat would you like to see from health related events to make you more interested in attending? Both event topic wise and things at the event? \n\nAny incoming freshmen please share your thoughts.",

I spend most of my days going to classes or studying and any free time I have I wanna spend it doing something fun. Something like an \"educational event\" isnt gonna sound fun or interesting to many people and most people would rather do something else. If you want people to go to your event you have to make it fun and worth someones time.",

Like \"stamp passports\" for visiting stations. \nLike if it's related to weight/diet, communicate with the physical education areas, like sports management, physical therapy, nutrition, even food management. If its about sex, communicate with the psychology, philosophy, sociology, and social work departments.",

There are educational programs at Sursa, the Planetarium, and the Rinard Orchid Greenhouse all the time but unless you actively seek out information about those places you'd never know they existed. I have a son and I've asked friends with children if they'd like to come with us to the planetarium when they offer shows for kids. I'm always shocked by how many times I get responses of \"Muncie has a planetarium?!\"",

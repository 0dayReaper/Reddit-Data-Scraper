    "postText": "Does anyone know what date we can expect to receive degrees in the mail? I know it is suppose to take 4-6 weeks I believe, but was wondering if anyone could give some insight into how long it took them to get theirs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, for anyone that borrowed a federal loan; do you need to have exit counseling done before they will send the degree/ let you access official transcripts for applying to jobs? I'm not sure what the policy is regarding whether or not they withhold any transcripts if a loan goes into default (i'm still in my grace period but wanted to know in case the job search takes longer than expected). Anyone that has any information on this is greatly appreciated. I've contacted an advisor to try to confirm some of these things but if anyone has an answer sooner I thought i'd find out.",

I don\u2019t remember exactly. \n\nI still haven\u2019t done loan counseling and haven\u2019t had any issues with accessing transcripts and I obviously still got my degree. \n\nHope this helps!",

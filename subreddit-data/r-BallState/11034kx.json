Would you share your experience at BSU? Any particularly good or bad experiences with availability as a freshman - and was finding decent housing a challenge in subsequent years?",

Had a mom call me the first weekend her son was on campus because her kid hadnt called home in the 48 hours since she\u2019d left him there. Then called again the following weekend because his roommate hadn\u2019t come back one night (spoiler: kid got lucky and didn\u2019t feel it necessary to tell this person he\u2019d literally just met",

Your son will not have a choice in his first year, but then he can try to get a place at Anthony (closer to campus) / Scheidler Apartments, which tend to be cheaper to rent than off-campus. If he's a kid who can figure things out on his own, he will get a good feeling of what's best for him after the first year.   \nAlso, plenty of undergraduates share houses near BSU, although they tend to be bigger houses and have more housemates.",

I did the Honors College and was placed in DeHority as a result, but this was in 2015 when the main freshman housing (LaFollette) was not very good, so DeHo had a lot more perks than it probably does now.",

            "comment": "Highly recommend living in the dorm for two years if its in the budget. \n\n1) This is the first year incoming freshman can choose their own dorms! Learning Living Communities (LLCs) are nice, but some dorms are super on the edge of campus. Personally I recommend Baker/Klipple (in Noyer Complex) or Stu East if you want air conditioning and a shorter walk. Nicer dorms (North, Northwest, Johnson A or B) are fancier, have newer things, and tend to house more LLCs, but they are a further walk to classes. \n\n2) If you live on campus for two years, this makes you eligible for an amazing deal with campus apartments. With Anthony or Scheidler Apartments, if you live on campus for two years prior, you get $250 dining plus per semester, as well as a free commuter pass. And in those apartments, you don't have to pay utilities. Also, busses run past them. \n\nHope this helps- let me know if you have any questions! (I'm a current Junior)",

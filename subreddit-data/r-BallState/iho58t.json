I\u2019m burning through my data trying to even try to communicate with people on campus. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a solution I\u2019m not seeing, but if this keeps up then this year\u2019s gonna be downright impossible to get through.",

Never figured out why but it always got better. \n\nMy guess was always that people were all on it at the same time until the semester got busy and they slowly started to be on less often or at different times of day.\n\nA wired connection is way better if you can get one. Obviously not on a phone, but a computer really benefits.",

They are pretty much self managed unless something breaks so just gotta give the system time to adapt if they don't instantly pick up.",

You would have to go and buy a small usb wifi adapter capable of connecting to 5Ghz networks. Not sure about your phone. I've only been in the AT building so far this year and the wifi has been fine. I would try forgetting bsuconnect and reconnecting to it.",

Random wireless issues plague everyone, in part because of password changes, should be easy to get fixed if you know where to look or go for help.",

I think you are required to take 1 class, absolutely your freshman year, for 1 or no credits. It meets like once a week for part of a semester. The priority scheduling alone makes it worth joining. You may also enjoy some of the classes they offer too, ik I did.",

A decent amount of the professors  are pretty chill about not giving too many assignments, so check rate my professor to figure out who you want. However, if youre not a liberal arts major, the classes wont really help much. It really just depends on how you learn best. Compared to the core classes where most are about 80-200 students per class, the HC has smaller class sizes compared to a high school.  Feel free to DM me if you have any questions about professors or just the HC in general.",

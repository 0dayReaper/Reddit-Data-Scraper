I am a first generation college student and applying for grad school is intimidating.\n\nWould it be appropriate if I ask the place I am volunteering at for a letter of recommendation? I would be volunteering at this place for around 120 hours in the span of 3 months, is that enough?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read/comment/etc!",

We mostly focused on types of strokes and did water activities. Our prof was also great. There were a few tests and quizzes mostly on water safety, but were easy. If you do basic studying and participate you\u2019ll pass :)\n\nIf you can- try to take one later in the day as the 8am ones can be a drag to get up to. \n\nBut honestly it\u2019s fun. Just rinse off before, shower after and then be on your way!",

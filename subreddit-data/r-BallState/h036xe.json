I always just explain to people that we're named after the Ball jars because the factory used to be there (but is now in Colorado Springs). I'll also mention Letterman and Jim Davis (The Garfield guy) went there. I used to mention Papa John but people ain't too cool with him anymore.",

By all means have fun but the name of the college you may attend shouldn\u2019t be a determining factor nor should the opinion of other people about that name. It\u2019s your education, focus on that, and if Ball State is a fit for your want/need then there you go.  Ball out young gun.",

I think it really sets people up for success. \n\nBall So Hard University\nBalls Taint University\n\nIt\u2019s a great midwestern school with a few nationally recognized programs and some fairly famous alumni. Don\u2019t let a name decide where you get your education. Let the programs. And make fun of yourself a little bit.",

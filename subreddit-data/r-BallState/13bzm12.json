    "postText": "I\u2019m currently in high school and looking for colleges to go to for premed, as I want to become a sports medicine physician. This would mean that Kinesiology would be a good major for me. This in mind, I\u2019ve seen online that ball state is a very strong school for premed, and it does have the major that I want to pursue. Is this true and would you recommend it to students\n\nAdditional note, I would be coming from out of state, so I would need some scholarships, although I\u2019m a strong student, so that shouldn\u2019t be much of an issue if there\u2019s good merit scholarships.",

The faculty are caring and if you are a good student there are plenty of opportunities for you. You can work closely with faculty and have research opportunities as well. As with any major, you have to take advantage of those opportunities in order to stand out, though.",

            "comment": "Not a kinesiology major or anything, however, another comment mentioned getting involved in research and I have done research at the university and I highly recommend doing the Teacher-Scholar Program and/or the Pathways Undergraduate Research Fellowship to get some research experience early on and even get paid to do it! I've done both programs as a psych major and both programs offer research experience in other fields, so you might just find one that's super interesting within kinesiology or maybe even pre-med. You'll get to work under a faculty member doing research on a topic within your field, likely gaining experience with data, reading research articles, understanding key concepts within the field, presentations, etc. and both programs offer a $750 stipend for your work. If you do decide to go to BSU you should definitely think about doing research through these programs to beef up your CV early on because it'll look great for med school in the future. I wish you the best of luck on whatever university you decide to attend and never forget to put your mental health first!",

They promote so many unhealthy standards and ideas and just have no regard for safety. Even without Covid, I have no sympathy for Greek Life, it\u2019s only been allowed to go on for so long since so much revenue is made out of it, money always seems to be the focus these days.",

You can\u2019t say they don\u2019t have issues every single semester, I can\u2019t remember a single semester where there wasn\u2019t some heart breaking story coming out from one.",

However, I\u2019m also aware that we can\u2019t scape goat frats and everyone is making mistakes right now, not just frats. We all have a lot to lose and I hope greek life is doing their best, I\u2019ve heard some worrying things about Tau Delta Tau (my bad if I butchered that) and their disobedience to guidelines.",

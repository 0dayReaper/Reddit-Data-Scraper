Im starting in the fall and I\u2019ve heard those two classes are rough so I want to get a head start over the summer.\n\nIf someone could help me out that would be great! I just need to know the title and author! Thank you for your time!",

For intro bio, I\u2019m not sure what book you\u2019ll need, but you\u2019ll most likely be able to find a PDF of the book online for free (unless you also need to buy an access code for the class that gives you textbook access).",

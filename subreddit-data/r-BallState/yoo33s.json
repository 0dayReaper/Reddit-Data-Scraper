No problem, I can wait my turn. Once the bus is getting close, suddenly a huge crowd from the dorms nearby North Dining come. The bus comes by and the dorm group suddenly walk to the front of the line. I understand that everyone does not want to walk and they are trying to get to their class, but it's kind of inconsiderate to those who were waiting for the bus to end up having to wait for the next bus or have to walk because others couldn't wait in a kind-of disorganized line.",

            "comment": "Walk to the parking lot next to North. Saves you a lot of time. North is a terribly designed bus stop because it holds 4 dorms worth of students with a bus stop next to its biggest attraction that adds to that already over crowded pool. Kids can wait inside comfortably. Kids get bored waiting so they buy Starbucks real quick. Miss the bus? No worries, go buy Starbucks. Get back late and you still haven't used a swipe? No worries, Starbucks is still open. It's all by design. It speaks more about Starbucks philosophy than BSU's. But they got wrapped up in a deal that's hard to turn down. It's ultimately a net negative for students' mental and physical health but it makes BSU a ton of money. It's easy to blame the crowds but that isn't the root issue. The solution here is more busses with higher paid drivers. BSU has the busses to accommodate but not enough drivers, because of the pay. This will not be resolved until enough students and parents complain about it, so good on you for noticing the consequences of this massively greedy mistake.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk.",

                            "comment": "The first primary and secondary schools began opening a little less than two weeks ago.\n\nAs of this past Tuesday, August 11th *only 14% of all American primary and secondary schools had begun class.* \n\nIn that tiny time-span, more than 407 schools have had to completely close down or quarantine *entire classes and multiple teachers and staff*. \n\nThat's bad, and it isn't the full number - and it includes millions of students who are doing distance learning rather than attending in person making the figure all that more staggering.\n\nBetween yesterday (Wed, August 12) and this coming Monday 29% of primary and secondary school students return to school - this 6 day period represents the largest percentage of students returning to school for any week this year. Obviously, it is more than double the number of students already in school.\n\nTests are slow, in some places it is taking more than a week to get results - including in places where schools are now open. \n\nIn many places, teachers can't get tested - not with any regularity or special expediency (although an NFL player can get a test - a better one actually - every day: we've got really fucked up priorities as a country...)\n\nChildren are much more likely to be asymptomatic, so even if it is spreading quickly in a school there may be little evidence of it without widespread testing for at least a week.\n\nAt that point, it is too late, children bring it home, their siblings, parents, grandparents catch it. Their teachers catch it. \n\nSchools are going to be the single biggest vector of transmission for covid19 yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy Monday, *only* 43% of students will have returned to school - we won't see any significant spikes or testing shutting schools down until at least a week after they open (exceptions being when staff or a student get tested *independently* and end up getting things shut down earlier). It takes on average 25 - 40 days for someone to die of covid19, so it'll be another month or so until we start seeing reports of dead teachers, grandparents, principals - and children. While few children die, some still do. In a country of 325 million, even if only .01% of children under 18 die, that will be thousands.\n\nBetween next Wednesday and the week following Labour Day, the remaining 57% of children will return to schools.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd again, with only 14% of students back in school, and the first school openings only being about 15 days ago, we already see cases of kids dying, of classrooms being quarantined, of sick teachers, of schools closing down entirely - and at least 407 schools with enough of a problem to have to take major actions to stop transmission. And the vast majority of these schools are in 'red states' where support for returning to school is much higher than in more 'blue' states. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll that said, add in universities. Sure, many are doing online education for a semester. Yet, that is a tiny minority. Most are opening, some already have. Most universities open sometime between the last two weeks of August and the first week of September. Unlike primary and secondary schools, universities bring students from all over. Smaller ones largely bring students from across their state and neighboring states. That is bad - it will help spread the virus relatively evenly across regions as universities open - and college students get out and about (and usually don't stop partying and such when they feel sick because they are at the age where they feel completely invincible - and yes, I know most people reading this are in that age group - but it's true, a 21 year old is going to spread it, on average, much more widely than a 35 year old. Younger people have more friends, go out more often, tend to go out to more places, party, etc.\n\nBigger universities, like Purdue and it's near 40,000 students (and another 10,000+ faculty and staff) situated in two connected towns with a population of 100,000. Purdue brings students from all 50 states and, on average, around 70 countries. Purdue reported a few days ago that more than 90% of students would be attending on campus - and the many new, unbelievably massive, miniature cities called apartment complexes that have been put up all over campus may not be as tight a squeeze as a dormitory (where thousands will still live with roommates and with shared bathrooms). Yet that will only give a false sense of security: elevators will transmit the disease; the massive ventilation systems will spread it throughout the buildings; many of these apartments of gorgeous decks (and the roof of several complexes are now essentially hang-out party spots, complete with decorations and seating - it will spread in apartments almost as quickly in dorms - and it doesn't matter anyway because all of these students will intermingle.\n\nIt DOES NOT MATTER how prepared your university thinks it is. Epidemiologists seem to have a consensus view on this. Masks reduce the spread, they don't stop it - even if worn *perfectly all day long* which no one does. Students will touch their faces. Students will take off and on their masks (and we know handling a mask you keep putting on and taking off can lead to infection from handling the *front side* of the mask. Students HAVE TO remove masks to eat, and I'm sorry but the Purdue approach of only allowing people to eat at 'every other table' in each cafeteria is asinine. They are rooms where no one will wear masks, wear tables will not get sanitized quickly enough, where people will not social distance. That is all it takes.\n\nAdd to that the age of many buildings on most university campuses. Older buildings have poorer ventilation, no matter how much work gets done on their HVAC systems. Rooms get hot. Teaching a 75 minute class in a room that is too small and has poor ventilation? I don't care if everyone wears masks perfectly and has hand sanitizer on their desk, it will spread in those rooms. It will be on desk surfaces. **We now know that the virus can linger in the air for up to 3 or 4 hours, particularly dangerous in smaller rooms.**\n\n**Quarantines** won't work - you can't quarantine a class where it broke out (which is happening with some secondary and primary schools - and that too is asinine....). Where do you quarantine? Your dorm? That doesn't work! What about your professors - when they get exposed how does your class move online? How does attendance work?\n\nBottom line: schools are not capable of stopping the spread, and in fact will witness the virus spread faster than it has anywhere else. It is necessarily going to happen when you bring 1,000s, 10,000s of people from all over the country and world into a mini-city within a city. It'll take a couple weeks and we'll find 70% of students and faculty infected at a given school.\n\nClosing a university is hard, too, as we learned in the spring. Professors *either* design an online course or an in-person one and it is *very hard to transition an in person class online*. Students have to pay to go back home, it takes time - and as they go home they bring the virus with them.\n\nBall State. IU. Purdue. Notre Dame. University of Illinois. Northwestern. University of Ohio. University of Nebraska. Phoenix University. And so on - schools the size of small cities. These will make an already horrifying situation unbearable.\n\nSo my advice? Stay home, take online courses or take the semester off - everyone else is going to, but many will wait until their infected and can go back and infect their families.",

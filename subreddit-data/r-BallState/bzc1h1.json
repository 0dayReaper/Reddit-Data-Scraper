If you\u2019re more into fast food there\u2019s a Chick Fil-A and Papa Johns at the Atrium, and there\u2019s a Taco Bell at the Student Center. Honestly you\u2019re probably best off just waiting until you move into the dorms and just going around campus and finding what you like. There\u2019s a lot of great options",

However, the breakfast sandwiches at the deli place in there are the bomb.\n\nRemember, you can check Net Nutrition to see what food each place is going to have for the week. This is helpful for things that rotate, like the Woodworth comfort foods.",

    "postText": "Howdy!\n\nI'm a very intrapersonal guy.  I have friends but I like spending a lot of time alone.  So, it's tough to find people who want to be my roommate, because I don't like the idea of hosting parties at my place.  Last year, I just settled for staying in the dorms, but I really wanna get out of them this year.  Next year, I'll be turning 21 so I'd love to have a place where I can actually take advantage of it.\n\nSo, does anyone one of any apartments that are good for a single person?  They all look ridiculously expensive, from what I've seen.  A studio apartment would be fantastic, but I'm good for just a single bedroom apartment.\n\nOr, as shown in the title, is anyone looking for a roommate?  I don't like large groups, but I feel fine in groups of 3 or 4.  And I'm very comfortable with the idea of having a roommate; I would actually love to have a roommate who likes to talk, play video games, and drink (moderately).  I never go to parties but I love chilling, drinking, and whatever in smaller groups.  \n\nI have a car, so parking is a must.  If you have any ideas, let me know.  If you're looking for a roommate, hit me up and we can chat.  I'm looking for the Fall and Spring of the 2014-2015 school year, because if we wait, we won't find anything.",

My fraternity brother rents it out I think 3k a semester.\n\n\nThat, or just go out and be more fun and social and stuff and find random roommates and live the kind of life you will dream of living again in another 3 years. This is your chance to do anything and everything you want because at this time in your life, though an adult, the reprocussions for your actions are minimal at best. Go be insane. Hire 2 strippers and have them follow you around for a night (it'll cost like 350 bucks for a 10-12 gig with them and you'll be a god damn rock star)\n\nThe end. ",

My friends tell me all of the \"great\" stories: sluts sucking people off, free oceans of shitty beer, all that shit.  They also tell me the shit about people puking all over themselves, people getting lost a couple of blocks from home, and the dudes with the ramped-up egos.  I *HATE* that shit, which is why I don't go to parties anymore.\n\nBut, my friends come back from their nights and laugh about it.  I've had friends tell me stories about getting busted by cops (and getting underages) and they laughed about it the next day.  I honestly can't figure out why.  I've been told the old adage \"adrenaline is a hell of a drug\".  But all I see is a lot of potential champions wasting themselves for a night that they barely even remember.  And when I ask them why \"blacking out\" is fun, they just tell me that even though they don't remember it, they remember how much fun they had.  That doesn't fly for me.\n\nIn three years time, I'll be looking back at my life and I won't regret a minute of it, because I didn't waste it by \"being insane\".  I've actually got a hell of a lot to lose right now.  I have a nice job and a leadership position in my organization, both of which are very professional.  I really don't care if other people act like idiots during the time that they can, and I have plenty of friends that do stupid shit all the time.\n\nOther people can do what they want, but I'll do what's been working for me.",

I am looking to avoid living in the dorms to save money. I have a few places in mind close to campus that I am interested in living in, but am looking for up to 2 roommates. If anyone is interested let me know. ",

Nobody I know that lived with bnl has gotten back their security deposit. They won't let you move in until you've paid in full. Doesn't matter if your aid check doesn't come in until next week.  Other rental companies are gonna be more lenient about things, not enforce harsh deadlines, be generally friendlier to you and treat you like a person.",

As your post says you are looking for roommates so I didn\u2019t know if you were open to living alone. I do agree with the comments about joining the Facebook group though. A lot of activity on there compared to this sub. Shame that it is so dead ",

Too many times have I neglected to do so, only to go back to my room with the wrong order. I don't mean to shit on the student workers there, and I realize the Hub cafeteria can be quite noisy, but I don't want to pay for a chicken deluxe sandwich only to find a regular chicken sandwich in my bag after I've already left. \n\nI'm sure most of you probably know this, but for new students like myself, just a reminder to make sure you're getting what you pay for.",

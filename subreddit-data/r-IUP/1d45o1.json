    "postText": "Hi everybody. I'm moving in August to begin a Ph. D. program on campus.  I live outside of the country and can't make until mid-June at earliest.  So, hopefully I can get an insiders view of the town.\n\nI'm looking for a place to live and some general tips about the town/area.  I'm looking for real-world info...and there's no better place than here.\n\nBest places to go/live/eat/do? Parks/hiking opportunities?  Events in town/campus?  Generally, what is off-campus rent?   Do students live in trailers/mobile homes around the area?  Anything else???  \n\nI've visited a couple times, and think it's a pretty nice western PA town.  I own a motorcycle and can't wait to explore the area.  If anyone on here has a bike, I'd love to get and ride.  I will be there a couple of years and am looking forward to the experience.   Thanks for the help!",

Most students live in apartments or rent houses.  Rent is typically $300/month per person as long as you aren't living too close to campus.\n\nThe only thing to do in Indiana is drink.  If you are a Reddit stereotype then go to The Brown like that other guy said.  If you are a normal person go to Boomerangs or Twisted Jimmys.  If you are looking for a place with loud music, dancing, and trashy women go to Wolfies or The Coney.  \n\n",

It could be 80 degrees and sunny one day, then snow, then rain and wind to make tropical islands jealous. It's not always the most fun.\n\nBeyond that, speaking as a Music major, there's always a lot of cultural events occurring around campus, and a couple in the surrounding area. This includes dance, visual art, etc. Not to mention this, but there's a lot of good restaurants around (unfortunately most of them American style food only).\n\nThere's also the people who live here to not go to college - I've never run across a rude one, except for those who own some of the businesses (but they probably just have a bad time with college kids).\n\nHope you have a good time when you get here!",

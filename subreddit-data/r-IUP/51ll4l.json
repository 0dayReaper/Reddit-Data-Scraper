Is that correct?\nIs there a way that I can get a login username and password for Iconnect if I don't work or go to the university? \nAny help would be much appreciated.\n",

Students pay for the wifi through their technology fee every semester, faculty and staff members work there. If you're not working at/with IUP or a student, I can tell you that you will probably not get access.",

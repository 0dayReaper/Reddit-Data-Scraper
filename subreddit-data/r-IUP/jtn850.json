To request your absentee ballot from click [here](https://ballotrequest.sos.ga.gov/) and register to voter [here](https://registertovote.sos.ga.gov)\n\nI would also highly recommend reaching out to friends and family in GA to confirm they're registered. Also, anyone who will be 18 when the election happens in January will be eligible to register, even if they're 17 now.",

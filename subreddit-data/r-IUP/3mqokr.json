I forget the link but it's somewhere in the student IT guide on iup.edu.\n\nEdit:\nhttp://www.iup.edu/resnet/how-do-i-connect-my-computer-or-device-to-the-internet-/\nGo to the bottom of this page, Click on \"Network Registration Page\" enter your 4 letter username and password. Enter the MAC address of your Wii U. MAC address should be located somewhere in the settings of your console, If not there is a guide of how to locate the MAC address.",

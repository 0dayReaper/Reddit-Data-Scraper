Just be sure to check with the rate my professor website cause there are some bad apples you don\u2019t wanna take. Other than that the whole program is pretty good especially cyber security. Most of the classes I took were challenging but by no means impossible, and if I was struggling between office hours and tutoring there are a lot of people willing to help you. So I\u2019d say overall decent program",

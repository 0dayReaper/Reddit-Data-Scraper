    "postText": "So me and my friend are probably going to IUP fall 2014, and we are going to be living in Whitmyre, so what should I know about? Conditions of a scholarship are making me stay there, so wanna know. Are there doubles at all or are they singles entirely? And I saw they only seem to have public restrooms and showers. Anyone wanna give me the info?",

            "comment": "Nowadays, the temperature control is better, but it can still be a potluck depending on which room you get.  Every room I've been in has working heat, but some of the rooms don't have working ac.  There's not a computer in each room, but one or two of the common rooms have computers.  It's really great having some of your classrooms in your building. All of the classrooms have tvs in them, and anyone can use the rooms and tvs for anything when class isn't in session.  They recently upgraded the wifi so it comes in strong throughout the building. There are 2 ethernet sockets in each room if you have a desktop or a gaming system (they don't like gaming systems on the wifi).  If you want, I can run around taking pictures and load them onto an imgur album or something.",

Sounds like the whole setup is pretty good for what I'm gonna be paying. And honestly it'd be pretty nice to see some of the dorm. Word of mouth is one thing while seeing it is another. ",

It was mostly co-ed by wing except on the third floor which was co-ed by room.  Rooms had two beds (bunkable), two desks, two closets, two sets of drawers and one mirror.  They were carpeted.  We didn't have much control over the heat, it seemed to just come in full blast during the winter (but you could open the window).  At that time it was not air-conditioned, but I think I heard that it has been since then.  There was one bathroom per wing with maybe three toilet stalls and three shower stalls.\n\nI liked living in a dorm where I had classes in common with all the residents and classrooms downstairs.  ",

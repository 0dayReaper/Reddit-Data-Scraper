As I'm in the arts, I have an MFA - most of the fine and performing arts don't terminate with PhDs, as the doctorate is considered more appropriate for scholarly instead of creative fields.  After grad school, where I had some teaching experience, I went on to work in the field.  Most adjuncts have that combination, to some extent - a terminal degree, teaching experience, and professional experience.  You might see less professional experience in the more scholarly academic areas.",

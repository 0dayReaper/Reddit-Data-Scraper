Their 1-person studios were pretty nice and the price was very fair when I was there.  I know they were upgrading things and raising costs but you should definitely check it out.  Plus, it's literally right next to campus, which has it's pros and cons.  I was a business student and Pratt Studios is right next to Eberly, which was super convenient.",

All utilities except cable are paid for, parking is provided, and washers/dryers are in the building. Pretty close to campus, especially if you have classes in the Johnson, Wyant, and Stright buildings. Furnished packages, including a kitchen table, sofa chair, and mattress are also availabe. It was a good and cheap option for me (2300 per semester), although the room itself is a little small.",

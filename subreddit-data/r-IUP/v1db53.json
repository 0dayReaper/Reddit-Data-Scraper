    "postText": "Here's how to register to vote in Pennsylvania. These instructions work nationally so they can be shared with out of state friends or family and use non-partisan information.\n\nPlease share the info with anyone who might want to register, but hasn't had the chance, time, or info to do so yet.\n\n**Basically: Find your state **[**here**](https://vote.gov/)** and use your state's online voter registration tool to register.** If your state is one of ten that does not currently allow online registration, this website will tell you and will tell you how to complete your registration - it's usually printing/filling out a form and mailing it in.\n\nOR, you can [register to vote in person](https://www.usa.gov/election-office).\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n**Q: Am I already registered to vote? Am I eligible to vote? Do I need an ID to vote? When is my next election?**\n\nAnswers [here.](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/sviddomestic.htm)\n\n**Q: If I'm 17, can I register to vote today?**\n\nYes, in a number of states! If you proceed through to your state's online voting portal, which can be found [here](https://vote.gov/), it'll tell you whether you're good to go.\n\n**Q: I'll be moving to college soon. Where should I register to vote?**\n\nEither place - your choice. If you register to vote at school, you'll need to register or re-register with the state your school's in. If you decide to keep your home address as your voting address, you can head home to vote or vote by absentee ballot (info below on how to request &amp; return one).\n\n**Q: What if I need to change my voter registration?**\n\nFind your state [here](https://vote.gov/) and follow the instructions. If you have any further questions call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm).\n\n**Q: Can I register to vote on election day?**\n\nIf your state is purple on [this map](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx), yes. So, your friend who forgot to register can still come with you and get it done.\n\n**Q: What if my state doesn't have same-day registration?**\n\nThen your state likely has a registration deadline of about 30 days. That means it has to be **in their hands** by 30 days before election day.\n\nIf you're not registering online, I'd walk it to their drop box (most states have them, usually all-hours &amp; outside, call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm) to find out where theirs is) or walk it inside &amp; hand it to them, or mail it if you're doing it very early so you can be sure it arrived.\n\nBut don't depend on the mail within ...6 weeks before an election. It's just too dicey.\n\n**Q: Do I need to keep that voter registration card they'll mail me?**\n\nIt's useful for your reference &amp; knowing your polling place, but it is not *required* for voting. \n\n**Q: Can I use a pen with pink/green/orange etc. ink on these forms/on my ballot?**\n\nIt's the kind of thing you don't think of, until you do. They only allow the most conservative of colors and inks, so keep it simple: blue or black ball point pen.\n\nIf you're entering most of the info on the computer and then printing it out, your printer's default black ink is also fine.\n\n**Q: Can I get an absentee ballot?**\n\n*Make sure you're registered to vote first.* Then, [this page](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/VoterInformation.htm) will tell you your state's requirements, and how to request an absentee ballot.\n\nIf you vote absentee, unless you're mailing it in *very early* (over six weeks before the election), drop it off at their drop box (most states have them, usually all-hours &amp; outside, call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm) to find out where theirs is) or walk it inside &amp; hand it to them so you can be sure it arrived.\n\nYou can do that any day before the election.\n\n**Q: If I have a felony on my record, can I vote?**\n\nCheck [here](https://campaignlegal.org/restoreyourvote)! Often, yes.\n\n**Q: I'm forgetful. Is there a way I can be sent reminders?**\n\nYes! [Here](https://iamavoter.com).\n\n**Q: But, do the midterms matter in my state? My state's firmly Dem/Rep.**\n\nThey sure do. While your state may not be competitive in a presidential election, your *district* may be competitive for the House of Representatives and your Senator may be. Plus, governor, state reps, etc. \n\nThere are purple spots in blue and red states - you may be in one, and your vote could swing a number of outcomes.\n\n**Q: Where's competitive this year?**\n\nThere are particularly competitive races in more than half the states - either [Governor](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings), [House](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings), or [Senate](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings). \n\nThe list: New Hampshire, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Texas, Virginia, Washington, California, Colorado, North Carolina, New Mexico, New Jersey, Maryland, Indiana, and Rhode Island.\n\nIf you live in any of these states, there's a lot of competition for your vote this year and it's a great chance to get your voice heard.\n\n**Q: If my state isn't on the list, there's no point in voting, right?**\n\nIncorrect! Local races are hugely important. Some examples: county prosecutors can, for instance, choose whether to prosecute non-violent drug crimes or sex work that is occurring without trafficking. \n\nThey also recommend sentencing. Some are very strict, while some others choose to make those issues their lowest policy priority. \n\nState legislatures and governors decide, for instance, what happens with guns, lgbtq+ rights, and school funding in your state. \n\nState Attorneys General can defend state abortion laws or choose not to. \n\nSecretaries of State can help people register to vote or make it harder for them, within the already existing laws. \n\n--\n\n**tl;dr - register to vote. for a lot of reasons. if you read the news, or reddit, i'm sure you can easily come up with some.**\n\nif you have questions about registering in your particular state, comment and i'll do my best to help. i did election stuff as a job for a few years, and i know how complicated finding the information you need can be. that's why i'm making these guides now.",

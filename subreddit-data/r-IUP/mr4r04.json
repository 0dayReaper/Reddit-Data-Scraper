            "comment": "The party spots are random. Each year certain people are crazy enough to host parties before their landlords give them enough shit that they move.\n\nI've been doing door dash this spring and have seen parties around in the usual places, but much less with most of campus being remote.\n\nYou really just need to live south of Philadelphia street in walking distance of campus, then you can walk to or from parties, bars or friends places.\n\nNorth of philly st, you're looking at places in more quiet locations where you can bring ppl home with you.\n\nJust pick your apartment carefully, ask what the neighbors are like and such. If you get into an apartment building, be prepared for anything. Sometimes extreme party noise on finals week nights or getting the cops called on you because the neighbors can hear your music through the paper thin walls.\n\nI would recommend staying out of the Carriage House/Essex House apartments (The Apartment Store), and find a place sooner than later, if you wait until the end of the summer you'll end up getting stuck in a shithole or an overpriced place no one was willing to pay for.",

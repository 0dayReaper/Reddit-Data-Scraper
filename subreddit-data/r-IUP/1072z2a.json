    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m looking into a masters program here. There seems to be plenty of affordable housing, which I\u2019m happy about, however I\u2019m curious about the quality of the apartments. I\u2019ve already had my fair share of shitty apartments lol.\n\nI need something that I can live in year-round and preferably a 15-minute drive maximum. If anyone knows of apartments with decent interiors and good management please let me know.\n\nTIA",

I had to do a decent bit of looking, because a lot of the stuff was not the greatest in quality (I'm 30, maybe my standards are just higher). \n\nBut, you can find gems and some pretty decent stuff. Just look everywhere that you can.\n\nAlso, do NOT rent from Dynamic Real Estate, more specifically from a person who owns/work there named Sherrie.\n\nI'd recommend you my place, as I graduate in the spring, but it is already leased ahead to someone else. :(",

I\u2019m not even sure if IUP is right for me yet. Affordability and the quality of housing are factors for where I pursue my masters, though. Where did you find your place? I\u2019ve been looking primarily on Zillow and Apartments.com, but other sites might be better",

A lot of the places I looked at only rented per semester too, because of students, so make sure the places you\u2019re looking for can be rented for a proper lease duration.\n\nAs for where to also look beyond your places, I\u2019d check out Rent College Pads and also Facebook (as much as I hate it and don\u2019t use it). There is a group specifically that is for IUP/Indiana leases. I don\u2019t use Facebook but I made a dummy account for the Marketplace alone, because I have found some great things on there. One of which, was and is my current apartment and landlord.\n\nIf you end choosing Indiana and have any other questions about IUP/the area, just give me a holler!",

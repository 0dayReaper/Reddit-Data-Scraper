            "comment": "I mean aside from making taxes 10 minutes harder and needing to apply somewhere, is there any reason why working somewhere new is a big deal? I think it's a good idea to get a variety of work experiences, so unless you're making pretty good money, I would say it doesn't really matter. You are going to college to be educated, you aren't going just to keep working. College towns are literally always hiring, so there will be work no matter where you go. I don't think job opportunities should really be a large consideration when looking for schools, there will be jobs. I also don't think distance, especially between 40 minutes to 2 hours, is that big of a deal. Both of those are close enough for weekend home trips.\n\nPersonally I think you should be looking more for what they offer in terms of opportunities for you to further yourself. What sort of degree are you looking at? What sort of other interests do you have? I don't know much about SRU, what is their campus like in size and personality?\n\nI am a fan of IUP and it's the right choice for me, but it very well may not be for everyone. If you have already asked all these questions and it favors SRU, you should absolutely go there. You will have job options, I guarantee it. However if things are pretty even between the two, then absolutely come to IUP. 1:20 difference is not that bad, and you will have work as an added plus!",

Its full of a lot of previous jobs over the years. Its just an easy transfer between the indiana store &amp; my home store during the summer break and college semesters. Its about the simplicity. \n\nIm going for a psychology major with a minor in criminology. Im not sure what exactly im looking for.\n\nI like the area around indiana better, and im not crazy about the spacing of SRUs campus. I am leaning towards IUP, but thats also largly because I love the people at that store &amp; Id love to be able to work with them \ud83d\ude05",

    "postText": "Hi, my name's Nguyen and I'm from Vietnam. I just got admitted to IUP grad school the other day and I'm tremendously excited! I'll study Curriculum and Instruction in Fall 2022 semester. I hope to make friends and get to know everything about the uni and the state!\n\nI'm so overwhelmed guys. I don't know what to do first. Could you tell me what I should expect from the uni, and all things there? I only know the US through my screen at home. I read some stuff about Penn State, and the uni of course, but listening to your personal stories would be much better! It would be the first time to visit a faraway country, I'm so hectic and a bit worried XD",

Either way I\u2019m sure there will be a cultural shock moving to the US. I think IUP will be a great place for you and you will make a lot of great friends.",

I got good grades last semester. \nIndiana is quite a tranquil place but it's quite sad to me. OIE is great with helping me settling in. I also met some great people.\n\nThanks for checking in with me, I do appreciate it ! \u2764\ufe0f",

Multiple stores of necessities very close. It has everything a college student needs. \n\nNot sure what you\u2019re expecting, but this place is definitely not the large scale Penn State experience (assuming you mean State College). But, there are tons of people up here to make friends with and communities on campus to join. Also, make sure to make friends with people around your age! \n\nMost importantly, congratulations Nguyen! We are happy to have you.",

Initially has a rural feel (Coming from an originally urban area) but when the students are in town the population essentially doubles resulting in a more of slighter urban feel around campus and town. It\u2019s known to be a more active party school so if you like to get rocked and forget existing yeah you can do that too. You\u2019ll find all types of people so if you\u2019re worried about that don\u2019t, you\u2019ll find great people if you actively search. And yes, Pittsburgh and Indiana are very very hilly, undoubtedly you\u2019ll find some trails you like.",

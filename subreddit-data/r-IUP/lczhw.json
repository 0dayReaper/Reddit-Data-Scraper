I don't know if that means FROM egypt, or her parents came here and had her. \n\nThe reason news sources wont name her is because currently its \"the student claims ___.\" Once it gets more serious (trial, academic review, etc) they will name names, but until then it can be detrimental to her character if her name is let out.\n\nBut people don't just randomly call the ACLU without some certainty. More students will come forward and this prof will go down or at least be ridiculed.\n\nUntil then, try to figure out her name with the info I have provided",

The economics department is part of the college of humanities, not Eberly.  Economics professors do teach some MBA classes, but their offices are not in Eberly.\n\nAnyway, to hell with protecting her character.  The accuser's name got published, so why not publish the name of the accused?  I get it, it's a liability issue, but it's still annoying.  On the first day of classes next semester I'm going to wear a shirt or pin that says \"I'm an atheist!\"  If any professor even looks at me funny for it I'll at least drop the class.",

A journalism major tried to explain the whole thing to me, and all i got was that it had something to do with not blaming the person until legal action was taken and she *needed* to be named.\n\nMaybe she's a business teacher, idk, it happened in Eberly, and it MIGHT have been a grad class.",

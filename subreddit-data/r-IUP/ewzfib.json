Also, I imagine the food situation will be better now that Northern is open.\n\nI liked the people there too.\n\nWhat do you plan on majoring in? That's an important thing to consider.",

I\u2019m heavily considering joining the class of 2024, I just wanted to do some research before scheduling a tour. Thank you so much for the info tho, I really appreciate it!",

                            "comment": "&gt;Nursing\n\nI vaguely remember hearing one year that nursing students had to get some kind of special accommodation at the honors college due to a schedule overap (i.e. a mandatory nursing class with only one timeslot was at the same time as the Honors Core class's only time slot). I'm not sure if this is still the case or if this was just a one-time thing.  I recommend you ask about this to the people in charge of the Honors College.\n\nOn that subject, the core classes schedule is/was really weird. I think it was Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday?  That made scheduling a bit more difficult at times, but not impossible.\n\nHowever, if you are the academic sort, I think you will enjoy the honors college greatly.\n\nBy the way, I'm good friends with some of the nursing professors. If you have any questions or want some advice, I could ask them. Is there anything specific you want me to ask for you?\n\nAlso, you need to get some volunteer hours to stay in the honors college. I'm not sure if this will be an issue.\n\nEdit: to be perfectly clear, I have graduated, and I was in the honors college.",

How clinicals work because I was looking over the nursing curriculum and noticed that only classes were noted but there was no mention of clinical(s) and if were so post to find our own preceptors. \n\n2. Do we get to choose academic advisors or are they assigned to us by last name or major? \n\n3. What\u2019s the average class size for regular courses or pre requisites, and do they get smaller when it starts to get more concentrated in nursing? \n\n4. I also know IUP is a pretty big school so do most professors use TA\u2019s or is it more one on one? And are there more lecture style classes or more classroom based?\n\n5. Do the core honors classes and the regular gen ed classes go hand in hand, or am I only restricted to honors classes for both semesters. Because in my high school the honors kids were kind of separated from the rest of our class.\n\n6. Also do we get to choose the order of our classes because I know most nursing schools usually choose for you. Taking Anatomy and Physiology my freshman year is something I\u2019m anxious about. \n\n\nYou don\u2019t have to answer all my questions since I\u2019m planning to do a \u201cstudent for a day\u201d type of visit. But whatever input you have would be great.",

Most people have no idea what an honors college is. \n\nIt's a good opportunity, there are some great benefits. \n\nIt's not a Harvard like door opener.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ll be the contrarian here. Forget CHC. I knew it was a dope show when Cheryl Begress screeched on the opening day of Philosophy class freshman year that \u201cGod doesn\u2019t have a penis\u201d.\n\nWith that said, I would have crawled over broken glass for Janet Gobbel who was running the show at the time. She was tough stuff and came up by her own hand. Such an amazing and strong woman. \n\nThe rest of the profs were common swindlers who would wax eloquently about how smart they were and how dumb you are. There is no way in hell they could have ever made it in the real world. I figured that much out when I started life-guarding and washing dishes in a Italian restaurant to pay tuition.\n\nI knew I was done with that place when they suggested that I go to a lesbian bondage art exhibit that was being featured on campus. When someone tries to force you to consume pornography and calls it fine art, you have a come to Jesus moment, wake up, and start thinking for your self. \n\nI think nursing is a fine selection of a major and unlike the rest of the art history, gender/philosophy studies students, you will graduate with a fine education and hard skills. I had a good number of friends from IUP that were nursing majors and they all had jobs waiting for them when they graduated. \n\nPersonally I felt like a freak during my time at CHC because I wore shoes to class and didn\u2019t smell. \n\nTo be fair my stories are about 15 years old now. But since then I have worked for two different federal agencies and put myself through grad school paying for it by working blood-money overtime and paying cash as I went.  I have NEVER once regretted leaving CHC. \n\nIUP is a great school, and a great financial value. If I could give you any advice outside of the normal \u201cshow up on time\u201d it would be the following:\n\n1. Go easy on the alcohol. IUP earned its reputation for a reason. An underage or DUI can wreck your life.  I\u2019ve seen it. \n2. Avoid Greek life. Learn to think for yourself and don\u2019t ever pay for your friends. \n3.  Seek meaningful friendship with people who share similar views (and maybe a few who don\u2019t). These people often make great study buddies and will be there for you the rest of your life if you treat them right. \n4.  The Freshman 15 isn\u2019t just \u201ca thing\u201d. It\u2019s you being lazy and making poor choices. Use the gym and go running or join an intramural sports team. Physical exertion is a great and healthy way to stay in shape and beat stress. \n5. The more you bed hop, the lonelier and emptier it will make you feel. But don\u2019t discount that you may meet that right someone!\n6. Don\u2019t trust anyone who went directly from undergrad to grad to the tenure track. If they could have made it outside of the university walls they would have. \n\nGood luck wherever it takes you. IUP had about  a 15k student population when I was there. It\u2019s really easy to slip between the cracks. \n\nPM me if you need anything.",

LOTS of hooking up. Walking home from Philly Street thru the Oak Grove at night. Wild and fun days, they were.\n\nYeah, I partied my fair share, but I turned out ok. Jesus still loves me.  I left with solid skills, well equipped to jump in to my career. My internship helped me a lot. IUP has one of the best Experiential Ed programs in the country. Nursing probably has its own practicum requirements, but everyone else should take advantage of the solid internship program. Mine was 12 credits.\n\nAnyway, hope you don't mind an older alum dropping by.\n\nPS -I don't remember the cafe food being particularly good or bad, but they had these awesome cookies. They were a large flat cookie that was kindy chewy and molasses-ish. Maybe a dash of cinnamon. Oh, I could go for one now. What are the chances they still make that cookie?!",

There is some nonsense, but if you\u2019re the type of person who would be considering it anyways, you will be able to put up with it. I don\u2019t think it is actually significantly harder than normal classes, but if you do it in good faith, you can probably get a bit more out of it.\n\nIf you have patience for the shenanigans, it can be a really useful tool for knocking out your gen-eds. I pretty much only had to take major courses and honors college classes, so I got to take a bunch of dumb electives for fun.\n\nAlso I understand Whitmyre is nice now.",

I am a history major and have been doing it for the 5 years I've been going here. \n\n\nAlso, if you have any questions, about the campus, the living/dining, the town, I probably have a helpful answer.

I am assuming as an incoming freshman you will be required to live in the dorms, if you have any questions about policy/activities/groups etc. let me know. \n\n\nOn the other hand, if you are looking for something to do up here,\nthere are pretty active groups for just about everything geeky on campus, from card games, to anime, to programming teams etc. The biggest advice I could give you is just try to get involved, don't expect to connect instantly with your neighbors and spend all week partying with them, college isn't really like that, especially with the 'suite style' living on campus now. Find something you are interested and there is probably a group for it on campus, even if its not an 'official IUP group'. \n\nPM me if you have any questions.",

            "comment": "As a CompSci major who is just leaving, realize that these professors have accents, and memorize your Banner ID number right away.  I recommend not taking courses from Dr. Sanwar Ali, unless you have to.  Classes by Dr. Smith and Dr. Fries are usually similar, except Smith is often much more challanging, and grades from Fries tend to be higher.  Dr. Ezekiel and Dr. Farag are funny and knowledgable, but they have backgrounds in engineering so they get off topic with technical sfuff that is confusing. The chair is Dr. Oblitey who has had a career in academia, not in the field, so he has a lot of lecture.  Execept for COBOL programming which is verbatim from quizzes to tests, so it's easy to study.  Basically, Dr. Smith has the most experience from real life programming (JAVA) and makes classes really difficult, but if you wanna learn, take him.  If you have specific questions, feel free to ask.    ",

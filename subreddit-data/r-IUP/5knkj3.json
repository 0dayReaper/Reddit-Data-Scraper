If you plan on being a academic for the rest of you life it's a good place to start and meet similar people.But if reading a 300 page novel and writing a 15 Page paper on it in three days dosnt sound like fun to you you will probably struggle. (Source I was a member of the worst CHC class ever. )",

The professors are almost always there to help you and will always have good advice. You also get helping scholarships and networking opportunities as well as other financial aid for internships and study abroad opportunities that are easy to apply for and essential for taking advantage of such opportunities. Go for it! I couldnt recommend it more.",

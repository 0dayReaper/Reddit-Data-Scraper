There is some organization that is doing something like bingo or open mic night, talent show, etc. Once you move off campus it is sometimes harder to find things to do. Indiana isn\u2019t really the center of activities. Joining a club or organization of some type (Greek for example) is a good way to fill some time. From the nursing students I\u2019ve talk to it seems to be a really close knitted group. It\u2019s a hard major so you make friends pretty quickly with those going through it with you. Once you turn 21 there is a pretty popping bar scene as well so that will help take up times with on your weekends. If you have any other questions let me know!",

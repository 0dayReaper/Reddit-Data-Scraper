                    "comment": "No, no, no - Venice Pizza, down by the tennis courts.  Bob's isn't bad, but I find it a bit too greasy for my tastes.\n\nKim Moon is exactly what you think it is - cheap chinese food.  it is good in the way that all cheap-ass chinese is.\n\nIf you are new in town, go to the Coney.  Eat things at the Coney.  Make sure you get Coney seasoning on the fries.\n\nSpaghetti Benders (on Philly, across the street from Wolfies) has, unsurprisingly, good pasta.  Perhaps surprisingly, it also has a massive gluten-free/celiac menu.\n\nIf you want coffee, and want to get more upscale than Sheetz, go to the Commonplace.  \n\nKranger's Cafe has some good panini sammiches.  Also, they will deliver on campus.\n\nI'll second 9th Street Deli - but bear in mind that their subs are MASSIVE.\n\nEdit: Okay, I profile stalked.  Welcome to Western PA!  Yes, go to Steel City.  And when you go to the Coney, get the salad with the french fries on it.  Eat-n-Park and Sheetz are not fancy, but they are local mainstays, and both are 24 hours.  If you are willing to take a drive, head out on 119 to blairsville, and got to Clem's BBQ.",

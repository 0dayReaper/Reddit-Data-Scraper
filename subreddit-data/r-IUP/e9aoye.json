(although they probably end up spending some money on enterprise-grade technical support contracts for Moodle).\n\nD2L isn't free, and IUP has to pay quite a bit of money to the D2L company every year to use it. That money is paid with YOUR tuition.\n\nThat said, it's completely idiotic to not completlely go one way or the other. I graduated earlier this year, but in my last semester I had some professors using D2L, one using Moodle, and some using Pearson (which is literally Satan in educational software form).",

Missed 2 online quizzes this semester because i was all \"no D2L notifs!\" and then remembered it was moodle long after the fact. Especially frustrating in this case because the Lab is on D2L and the lecture is on moodle!!!!!!!! lets get some consistency ladies and gents!",

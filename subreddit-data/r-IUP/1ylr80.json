            "comment": "They're all still there for the most part. Wolfendales was renamed \"Wolfies\" a few years back and now has an attached sports bar/restaurant.  Culpeppers underwent a renovation and now has an upstairs with pool tables and a bigger bar.  Other than that there are two new bars.\n\nTwisted Jimmies is located across 7th Street from Gattis pharmacy. It's sort of a frat dance bar place (I'm not a big fan) but it's attached to Steel City sandwiches which is basically a Permanti Bros copycat with decent food. Also new is Brunzies which is attached to Subs n suds on Phillie St. They have a good beer selection, a more laid back adult clientele and an expanded Subs n suds menu which is pretty good. That's all I can think of. Let me know if you have any other questions as I'm a big bar type of guy haha.",

            "comment": "Those three bars are still there, with semi-recent additions of:\n\n* Twisted Jimmy's (attached to Steel City Samiches / around the corner from Culpepper's)\n\n* Brunzies (attached to Subs N' Suds)\n\nAs a Pens fan and a non-smoker, those two places quickly rose to be my favorite two hang outs while I was there. Twisted Jimmy's is quite large and is very clean. It has a large main bar and a circular satellite bar in a connecting room, a couple tables in between, and a pseudo-VIP couch area (yeah, I don't know why). Their food is awesome since it's all Steel City items. Brunzies is marginally smaller (as large as the main bar area in the Brown), and I haven't seen it packed. Take that with a grain of salt, however, as it had just opened the last semester I was there and the snow kept a lot of people home. There's a main bar that is in the center of the room with three sides to sit on, and is surrounded by large booths. Both bars have large televisions and drink specials during games.\n\nI'll speculate a bit and tell you to assume that the Coney, Culps, and the Brown haven't really changed that much since you've last seen them. Still amusing / partly horrifying ass-shaking contests at the Coney and annoying live music at the Brown (it's annoying to me, but I don't usually go there, you might like it). I'm not sure if you're aware of Boomerang's, Benjamin's or Al Patti's, but they're still there, too. Oh, and there's a Cozumel by the Coney, too. The bar there is in the back of the restaurant.\n\nIf you want me to go into more detail about any of the places I mentioned, just let me know.\n\nEdit: /u/Balls_smell made great points and made me realize that I've blocked out Wolfie's from my memory. I fucking hate that place. They literally throw toilet paper on you from the balcony. What's the point of that? I'm too old for that place. I recommend Benjamin's, Brunzies, Culps, or Twisted Jimmy's.\n",

Any insight will help, thanks!",

Also this is a pretty dead subreddit so I don't know how many responses you'll get.\nI highly recommend IUP to anyone that asks.  It's a fairly large school so it's going to have the resources of a large university which is great but I never felt lost in the fray.  Honestly my favorite part about IUP was the people.    In general it seemed like it was very easy to talk to people, whether that was students or professors. \nYou'll have some large lecture classes and some smaller more intimate classes but they're a good balance.  I honestly didn't find them the most challenging but I'm sure that varries with major.  \nAs for dorms,  they're very nice in terms of cleanliness and newness but something about the suites make people less social since you don't really have to interact with everyone that much. \nIn terms of campus, it's beautiful.  The town has it's bright spots too.  Those first couple days of sunlight after the long grey of winter was always incredible.  Any questions just message me, I'll try and help out.",

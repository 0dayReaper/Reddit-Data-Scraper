I've never been a big drinker, and my night was definitely not about the alcohol.   I had some real heart-to-hearts with my bros, which actually occurred after sobriety hit.   I learned a lot tonight. Great night with some great people. Hope your finding some time to relax, because these finals are really killing me, and some time with the dudes was pretty refreshing.   Let's hit these tests hard next week. ",

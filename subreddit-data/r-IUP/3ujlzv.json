Need to choose a current student that's interested in running things:\n\nPost your qualifications in the comments and I'll choose someone. Ideally someone with a history of moderating who can code / make the sub look pretty.",

Now I am a Philosophy major, and a current student. I'll probably graduate Spring 2017.\n\nI'm very interested in getting IUP students to actually use this sub.\n\nEdit: I would also like to mention that most of the best subs are very Plain Jane in appearance.\n\nRootedoak ",

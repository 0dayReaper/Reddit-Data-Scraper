    "postText": "Just a reminder that the first month of class is filled with pretty much daily free stuff. Free food and drinks everywhere and mostly all day. Free entertainment, often in the oak grove or the hub. Free shirts at a lot of these events too! I'm a big fan of getting XXL shirts to sleep in honestly. STATIC is always hosting something.\n\nYou can follow many groups on Facebook/Instagram. If not, you can view events for the coming weeks on the IUP site. Get out there and get free stuff, your couple thousand dollar tuition pays for it\ud83e\udd74",

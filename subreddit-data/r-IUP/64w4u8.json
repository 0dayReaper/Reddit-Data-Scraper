    "postText": "I'm asking because I tend to frequent a site Called rpgmaker.net but for some reason today I could not access it, despite being able to use it on the network in the past. I'm not banned as I can log into my account on my phone if I'm using data rather than Campus Wi-Fi. If It is blocked I can't imagine why, it's an indie game development site and a fourm, It doesn't use P2P stuff for anything, takes a normal outlook on anti-piracy, and it's ads are even by google.\n\nI appreciate anyone who can help me out with this.\n\nEDIT: It's Suddenly Working, No Clue why, and no response from the help ticket.",

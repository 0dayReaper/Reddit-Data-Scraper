I think it\u2019s been in the hands of 3 \u201cadvisors\u201d within the last 2 years. \n\nNot sure about comp-sci as a whole, but I\u2019ve heard the cybersecurity major is pretty good, and I heard somewhere they just got a pretty large grant, so there\u2019s probably some good opportunities for scholarships there.",

There where a lot of passionate professors who were willing to help you out a ton and were very knowledgeable with specific aspects of the field. That being said I\u2019ve recently learned that they\u2019ve either canned or went elsewhere to teach. all that\u2019s left are the ones I would avoid during class scheduling. I would avoid comp sci here as of now, the program pretty much seems like it\u2019s on its last legs.",

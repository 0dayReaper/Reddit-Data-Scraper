There were a TON of questions I had while attending from my freshman year straight through to the day I was graduating. I will answer any question you can think of regarding just about anything from Jobs to Coffee to good and bad places to party.",

I have been focusing a lot on my federal loans account and I can't find any indication of these loans showing up. I am also a graduate of IUP but currently in graduate school so I'm trying to start working out my loan payments. ",

A lot of my female friends have also been drugged at multiple frats (ESPECIALLY ON HOMECOMING).\n\n Theater Kids tend to throw some pretty awesome parties, and the Drum Line used too have a great party house that miiight still be around. Theres a great punk house too, if your into punk music, live shows etc. To find these places you have to become friends with these people, because the houses move a lot. But if you ask around campus I'm sure you can find them. In terms of Bars, The Brown is fucking awesome, especially on Tuesdays. Boomerangs is great (don't let it fool you, that place rocks), and Culpeppers can be fun sometimes. I never stepped into Wolfies because its basically just a Frat and the owner is a total scumbag.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m applying to IUP for next fall and I can\u2019t find too much info about the different dorms (specifically, freshman dorms). \n\nSo far, I\u2019ve been seeing freshman with whole suits, semi-suites, and singles. Is this common at IUP?\n\nBesides that, I just want to know what all the freshman dorms are like. Which is the worst and why? What about the best? Where did you live freshman year and did you like it?",

            "comment": "Yep. The most common type of dorm is the shared semi-private, you and friend/roommate share a bathroom, but had separate rooms. Personally, which type of room you choose depends on your personality. If you have a friend with you on campus, you could go with the Shared Semi-private room (I cannot understate how good and useful they are); if you want your own room and bathroom the only ones that do this are the two-person private Bath and Room Suite and Four-person private bath and room. \n\nPersonally, I was able to luck out with a Two Person Private Suite and Bath. I didn't have a friend so I got shoved with a roommate (Fall semester's roommate was 10/10; Spring 2/10). I absolutely liked it, however they are more expensive than the others, so you better have scholarships to help you cover some other costs. This year, I lucked out with a one-person private room. Both the Suite and Room are pretty good. \n\nHousing on campus is pretty good, just remember to follow the rules of housing decency. For example, if you have some friends over at 11pm to party, you have to keep in mind that some people the floor below/above you might be trying to sleep. \n\nSorry for such a long response. Happy to help potential students get info.",

I don\u2019t think I\u2019d handle living with a stranger. My anxiety would be too much and I like things the way I have them. Would I be able to choose that? I have a scholarship there",

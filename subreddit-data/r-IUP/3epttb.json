    "postText": "So, I'm starting IUP in the fall as a second-degree student.  Writing actually has nothing to do with my major, but it is something I'm very passionate about.  At my last school, I was a creative writing minor, so I got to take lots of writing workshops, make writer friends, get feedback, etc. and I really miss that environment.  \n\nI was wondering if there was anyone in the area (IUP students, graduates, whatever, I don't care) that would be interested in forming a small writer's group with me?  I'm thinking just a few people, maybe 3-5, who are very serious and passionate about their writing that meet up regularly to brainstorm, read/critique each other's work, or just write together and keep each other focused.  \n\nIn case you're wondering, I write fiction and am working on a YA novel.  Other fiction writers would be preferred since that's what I work with and that's what I know, but poetry and non-fiction people are welcome, too.  \n\nIf you're interested, feel free to comment here or shoot me a message with your email and we can talk about our projects and when/where to meet up.  Hope to hear from someone!",

Maybe hang out at Commonplace, though if I recall that's more of a spot for internationals and geo kids, as well as psych majors. \nTry posting something to the bulletin board in Leonard, actually, as that would be your best bet I think. Should you succeed, you'll find it a smashing success. \nAnd don't discount the poetry kids! We're / they're pretty open once you get that shell cracked. \n\nBest of luck, friend ",

I don't know any of the buildings or anything, and probably would never know much about the English ones since my degree is in biology, so that insight is very helpful, thanks!\n\nAs far as the preferring other fiction writers thing, it has nothing to do with how open I think people are or anything like that.  I was a creative writing minor; I knew poetry and non-fiction people and didn't really find their personalities any different from fiction people, in a general sense.  It's the fact that I'd like a small group of tight-knit writing partners that get to know each other's work and critique each other, and I really couldn't do that for a poet.  I like poetry and everything, but I suck at it, and I'd never be able to critique a serious poet's work.  I'd assume that a lot of poets would feel similarly about prose, so I don't think either party would get a lot from that.",

There are three of us so far that should be there: you, me, and a guy named Anthony.  There's a fourth who's shown interest, but I don't think he's coming.  I'll sit on the squiggly couch at the entrance until we all meet up, and then we can go from there.  I'll be the girl with the bright red hair.  \n\nMessage me back if you can so I know for sure you're coming.  See you then!",

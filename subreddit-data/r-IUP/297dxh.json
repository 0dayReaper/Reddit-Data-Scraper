    "postText": "Hello IUP redditers, I will be a student at IUP this coming fall and am looking for a place to live (if you didn't gather that form the title). I decided to attend IUP this fall in early May, so rather late for the housing rush.\n\n\nI am a workaholic, so I probably won't be there much. I usually keep to myself unless engaged in social interaction by others, so I have lived with introverts and extroverts in the past and both have liked me. I'm not messy, but messy doesn't bother me at all. \n\n\nFeel free to message me if you want to know more. If you need an extra person or if you know someone who does, lets start talking and we can go form there. I am aware of single housing options, but I'd prefer living with other people. ",

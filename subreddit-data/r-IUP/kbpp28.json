    "postText": "Hey guys, I am going to be in Penn Run  from the 14th - 30th and there's no high speed internet available there, but I'm doing anywhere from 4 to 14 hours a day of video conferencing for this full stack dev class.  Does anyone know where I might be able to find a bare desk I can set up two laptops and two monitors with high speed access in the morning and break them down at night for a few weeks?  Is this doable on campus with covid happenin'?\n\nThe reason I ask here is this is the most active community local to Indiana PA.  \n\nAppreciate yinz.",

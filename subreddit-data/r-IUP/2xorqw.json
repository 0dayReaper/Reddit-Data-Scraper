    "postText": "I need to get my car inspected but I can't find anywhere that's any good.   I need the state and emissions.  I usually go to Sears Auto at the mall but they apparently don't have any who can do an emissions inspection anymore.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nUpdate: I tried to call Lias Tires, which had good reviews and a recommendation in the comments here.  They had a very long wait time so I couldn't get it done there.  Then I tried Monro, in spite of the poor reviews.  I just got out of there and I think they did a pretty good job.  I only got an inspection so I can't say they did good work, but they didn't try to gouge me for all my cash. I know most probably won't care, but I figured it'd be useful if someone else needed to get inspected and they came here for advice.",

A good mechanic that won't screw you is important.  I would recommend Karl's Auto - they're way out on 15th St, but just like a block down from Philly.  ",

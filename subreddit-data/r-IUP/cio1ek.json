Call in to set up service, then ask if there is a student deal for high speed internet. They offered me Blast! High Speed with HBO for the price of regular internet without TV. The catch being that the offer returns to a higher price after 6 months which you can ask to renew at that point.\n\nDon't bother trying to get this student offer without TV service like I have every time that I renew, because that is part of their game.\n\n100mbps down/10mbps up",

    "postText": "So, I'm new, a Graduate Student starting on the 21st.  I'd like to thank those who helped me a couple months ago with housing:  I've got a place to stay for the first semester at least!\n\nAnyways, I got a tour of the campus back in September from Graduate Admissions.  I know the basic layout of the campus and I know where my classes are, but I didn't see much more than that.\n\nI also don't know the area itself too well.  That day I was in a leisurely hurry to get to campus, do my tour, talk to my department, and head out to do an afternoon of Geocaching.  As a result, I only know of the area based on where my GPS took me.\n\nSo if anyone is willing to give me a more in depth tour of campus and maybe even tell me about or show me the surrounding area, I'd be grateful!  Or even some tips/places to go mentioned here would be appreciated as well!\n\nEdit:  I will be arriving on campus on the 20th.  This is the earliest I can move in.",

They're pretty cool guys, easy to work with. we have the bad luck of living in an old house right now (so there are just some annoying structure issues, but nobody is at fault), but they are respectful and have very reasonable pricing. I'm paying 1775 per semester right now. 4 person apartment, 15 minute walk from campus. \n\nHere's a link to their facebook. They don't have a website, but if you call them in the evenings they usually respond pretty quick.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Wetzel.Properties\n\n",

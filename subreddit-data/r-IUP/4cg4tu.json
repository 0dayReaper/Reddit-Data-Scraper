So only my boss and some co workers knew about it. I thought they were going to come to me and say something like, \"your user account sent out these print jobs, son. What do you have to say for yourself.\"\n\nSomeone came to our office yesterday to collect the printout and informed us that it was a malicious attack that printed in other parts of campus also. So it wasn't anyone in our office. She wouldn't say who it was, but then I saw this article.",

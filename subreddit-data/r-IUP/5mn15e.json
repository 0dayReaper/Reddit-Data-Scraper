            "comment": "Not especially good, in my experience.\n\nI've taken COSC 105, 110, 210, 220, 300, and 310.\n\nCOSC 105 is a mishmash of computer related things, ranging from extremely basic Linux terminal usage to binary addition. \n\nCOSC 110 is a Java programming course. I took it with Dr. Oblitey, and he gave us a grand total of FOUR programming assignments in the whole semester, and they were all really basic. The rest were a bunch of quizzes and tests.\n\nCOSC 210 is the second Java programming course. I took it with Dr. Fries. He was pretty good, and the class was okay.\n\nCOSC 220 teaches COBOL. This class was taught by Dr. Oblitey, and as far as I know, he is the only one who teaches it. I cannot emphasize how horrible this class was. COBOL is an awful language. Expect quizzes EVERY DAY. You may think I'm exaggerating, but I am not. I would rather kill myself than take that class again.\n\nCOSC 300 is an x86 assembly language class. I took it with Dr. Ali. Assembly is also a hard language. The programming isn't that bad, but I would avoid Dr. Ali. He uses some weird version of assembly that nobody else seems to know how to use. In addition, he spent the first half of the semester teaching logic gates, despite the fact that this material barely tied into the programming aspect of the class at all.\n\nCOSC 310 is the third Java class. I had it with Dr. Smith. His class had programming assignments every week, a mid-term, and a final exam. His assignments are very difficult, but it you see him during his office hours, he'll practically walk you through the process of writing the program. Make sure you get his help if you take his class.\n\nI'm no longer a COSC major, as I decided to switch to an MIS degree instead. Fortunately, I took just enough to get a COSC minor.\n\nOverall, I'd say the COSC classes here are a bit... mediocre. I'd check around with a few other people before committing to taking classes here.\n\nAnd if you do take classes here, avoid Dr. Oblitey. He's not a good teacher.",

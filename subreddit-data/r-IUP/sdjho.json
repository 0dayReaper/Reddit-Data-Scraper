I highly recommend getting involved with an organization right away. You meet friends you can study with and party with, maybe even at the same time. The Hub has the best food, but Foster has the best variety.",

However, if schwasted is in your future, then you'll be fine here. Join a club, start meeting people, if you live in a traditional hall (Elkin, Whitmyre, and I forget the third one), you'll have an easier time meeting people in your building just because of the way the traditional halls work. GO TO CLASS! Cannot stress that enough. But other than that, you should be fine",

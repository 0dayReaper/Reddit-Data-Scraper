            "comment": "Indiana can be a tough town to find something in, but there are many good deals here if you're willing to put in some work. Oak Grove realty is worth checking out, they have some cheap accommodations which allow pets, and a nice website you can browse. \n\nThe only way to do it right, though, is to hop in a car, or on a bike, and cruise through every street you'd be OK living on. Indi is very old-school, over half of the landlords here just post signs outside their properties and won't post anywhere online.\n\nI've moved four times in Indiana over the last 7 years, you'll find some things on Craigslist, some on realty sites like Oak Grove, and lots of things in person.\n\nGood luck!\n\nP. S. Amy Provias at Oak Grove realty is a gem of a person. She owns her own properties separate from OG but they're listed on the website. My brother stayed in one of her properties for a while, and I just couldn't praise her highly enough. If you can find one of hers that looks good, I would highly recommend. Good landlords/ladies are a gift.\n\nPPS as long as your parakeet isn't noisy, you're likely to get an exception from many landlords who have a standard no pets policy. Almost everyone I've talked to is somewhat flexible on the pet policy. If you find a place you like, ask. ",

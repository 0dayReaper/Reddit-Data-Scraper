            "comment": "I would not reccomend staying on campus as a 30 year old unless you are planning to become an RA and getting free housing. Living on campus as an older adult in general is really a culture shock. It is also very exspensive to live on campus vs finding an apartment in the nearby borough.\n\nIUP is a great state school in Pennsylvania though, I do reccomend it.",

Again this is my opinion, you're welcome to do what works best for you.",

RAs live in the dorms with other students and help facilitate a positive living environment. While this role is traditionally filled by an undergraduate, there may be opportunities for older individuals, like a 30-year-old, to serve as an RA. Here are a few potential benefits:\n\nFinancial Assistance: One of the most attractive benefits of becoming an RA is the financial assistance. Many colleges and universities offer free or reduced housing, meal plans, or stipends as part of the compensation for RAs. This can significantly reduce the cost of education.\n\nLeadership and Interpersonal Skills: Being an RA provides many opportunities to develop and refine leadership and interpersonal skills. You are often in charge of resolving conflicts, organizing events, and maintaining a safe and welcoming living environment. These skills can be highly beneficial in many career fields.\n\nExperience and Resume Building: Being an RA can provide valuable experience in management, administration, conflict resolution, and event planning. This can be a significant advantage when applying for jobs or graduate school.\n\nNetworking: As an RA, you'll have the chance to interact with various university staff and other RAs, potentially opening up opportunities for future references, internships, or job opportunities.\n\nFor a 30-year-old, there could be additional benefits. If you are returning to school, this role could provide a sense of community and connection with the younger students. Your life experience might also offer a unique perspective that can be helpful in managing dorm life and supporting younger students. However, there might also be challenges such as differences in lifestyle and the potential difficulty of living amongst much younger students.\n\nRemember, the specific advantages and responsibilities can vary depending on the specific college or university, so it's always good to research the specifics at the institution you're considering.",

I don't know much about our psychology program, but I know our crim program is one of the big things people come to IUP for, so that's potentially a plus for IUP.\n\nLike the other guy said, 30 would be a little old for on campus, not saying it's not allowed or anything, but I feel like it would definitely be cheaper to just get an apartment right off of campus. One of the largest and most popular places is campus edge which is a huge apartment tower that is literally a stone throw from campus, you don't even have to cross a street. If you decide to stay on campus regardless, you're probably going to be put in ground floor putt, that's where they house most of the older students such as grad students ect. The pros is that you would be allowed alcohol in your dorm room, the cons is that no one would ever talk to you, but maybe that's a pro in your eyes lol. \n\nI hope this helps! If you have any other questions feel free to ask",

Honestly you can go for it see how you like it but the choice is yours I\u2019m not a psych major but I do have it as my minor and I do have friends who are psych majors and I hear everything from them or of not my professors. It\u2019s kind of a crap show now for crim. I have no idea, if u do wanna be there at IUP go for it but that is my warning",

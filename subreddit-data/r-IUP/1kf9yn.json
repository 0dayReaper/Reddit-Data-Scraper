Instead, they're focusing on encouraging students to leave cars at home, and they're going to start upping the prices at Robertshaw. This is direct from a meeting I was at with the mayor of Indiana and President Driscoll.",

Besides, if I'm gonna try to get a job delivering pizzas or something, I need my car. This news really pisses me off. I mean, the parking is already shit, but what if we need to park there!? \n\nBut thanks for letting me know. Not you're fault, I'm directing my anger at Driscoll and Mr. Mayor. ",

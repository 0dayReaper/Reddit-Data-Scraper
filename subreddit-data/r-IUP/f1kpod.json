    "postText": "Me and my roommate saw the post about the college friends discord server and thought, why don't we just have one just for IUP? So we made one and we think it would be great for everyone to join so they can ask others for notes from a class they have together, where they can meet up for a project, or to find a group to hang out. Here is the link: [https://discord.gg/4UfjWSg](https://discord.gg/4UfjWSg)\n\nReminder: We literally just started this Around 10 minutes before this post so expect almost zero members, and remember that this is ***Unofficial***.",

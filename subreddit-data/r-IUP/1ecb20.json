That sounds doable because its not like the IUP budget is being slashed every year. Not to mention the fact that college admissions is a pretty precise science and schools have it figured out how stringent they can be with standards already. IUP does not have huge demand from smart, talented, high school students. It's a lower tier school. If they tighten admissions standards enrollment will drop and the budget will sink even lower. You're being idealistic. ",

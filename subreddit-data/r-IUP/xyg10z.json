It was a slice of white bread  with a slice of spam-type lunch meat and some canned fruit cocktail on it topped with a slice of American cheese.  The whole mess was shoved in an oven long enough to melt the cheese a little.  They also did things like recycle leftover French toast from breakfast into grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch.  I hope things have improved since those days.",

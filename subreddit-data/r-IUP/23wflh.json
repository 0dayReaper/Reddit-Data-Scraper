Remember to schedule as early as possible to be able to get into the classes you need and to never forget that the University has a lot of student resources like the writing center, to have your papers proofread and help with a resume, and Suplimental Instruction classes to help you prepare for tests and quizzes..and if you need anything else don't be afraid to ask your friends or your advisor. (Or if your advisor is a dick, you can get them switched! ;) ",

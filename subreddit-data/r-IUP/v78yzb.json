Is there anything that I should know (that isn't information given by the program advisors) before I'm at the campus?  \n\n\nAlso, for anyone who has went, what was your experience like there?  I'll be taking the CRISPR Cas9 disciplinary course, the \u201cHow do we create and use the past?\u201d course (Dr. Moore), and the \u201cWhat do we know? What do we believe? What\u2019s the difference?\u201d course (Dr. Schwartz).  So if anyone has taken any of these before, I'd love to hear your experience with them!",

I feel that you can handle it though. Cheers. Oh and you should pm me so I can play the game with you.",

I guess I'm really looking for an online server-host, or any other working solution anybody's found yet.  I can use other Minecraft servers, but my friends and i want to have our own.  ",

I bought a $50 dell workstation and slapped Linux and bukkit on it. Although windows will work as well. ",

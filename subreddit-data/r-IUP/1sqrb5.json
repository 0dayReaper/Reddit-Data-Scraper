Be smart like I did and split the rent with another veteran in a 2 bedroom house off campus.  At the time I was selecting a school a few years ago, I noticed then that the monthly pay for State College was $1100 and in Indiana it was $1450.  Since then they have all increased and you can look up COLA for every zip code online.  ",

If the new lady learned anything under him you are in great hands.\nDepending on your years of active service (How much deployment time? Were you active before guard?) and GI Bill type (30, 33, or TA) will map out how much you make per month. As long as you live in Indiana and not any farther east you will get Pittsburgh BAH ($1450) and not Johnstown which is $400-ish less a month.\nMy school was covered by grants, 80-110% each semester so I got a refund check ($900-ish) every semester as well.

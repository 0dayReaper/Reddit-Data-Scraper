Not too bad split 4 ways. This year it's just my gf and I and we're trying something different. We're using fios, Verizon's internet, and skipping cable altogether.  The bill is gonna be around $45 a month once start up costs settle. But it was a pain in the ass getting it to work. Going 2 weeks without service and spending hours talking to customer service everyday until they sent a technician. ",

I'm trying to make the best decision for us, and xfinity has been looking the best, just figured any other opinions would be valuable. When you had xfinity, was dealing with them okay? And how was the billing, like from what you read on the website to what you payed a month. Just hoping not to get screwed. ",

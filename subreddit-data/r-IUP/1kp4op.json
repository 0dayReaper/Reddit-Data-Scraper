I had terrible work study funds ($500 for the year), but my boss liked my work and let me sign up to be on the college payroll. So I was getting paid outside of my award funds. But try to avoid the food service jobs and apply for office jobs. I know that a lot of offices are looking for assistants at the beginning of the year. \n\nAnd honestly, if you work on campus, your boss will actually give a shit about your schedule. I worked at Dominos Pizza for the first two weeks while at school, but I quit right away because they weren't willing to work with my schedule. My job that I have for this year, which is on campus, is one that I get to set my own hours for. It's the best deal for a student. \n\nBut if you want a job, wherever it may be, start making phone calls or spending emails NOW. They do not last. My roommate last year started looking after the semester started and he couldn't find anything. \n\nIf you are positively opposed to an on campus job, then try at the mall, or at some of the restaurants nearby (Romeos pizza, taco Bell, McDonald's, Arby's, dominos, etc.). but be warned that dealing with drunk and hungry college kids is a pain in the ass.

I know that if you don't have a lot of FWS, you could be denied the job (because you can only work as long as they can pay you). I actually got denied from the job because of low FWS, but he called me back because he was in a pickle.\n\nIs there anything else on the page? Does it say what you could be missing? ",

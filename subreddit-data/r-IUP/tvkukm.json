            "comment": "There\u2019s a few reasons. I think it\u2019s due largely to declining enrollment. The housing office dumped millions into new dorms and dining facilities on the premise that there will be a large number of students coming attending on-campus classes and living on campus. They may make thousands per student but once you factor in the mortgage payments, staff salaries (the pitiful amount they are paid), the well-paid administrators, the maintenance, and the dropping number of students all lead to them closing down dining facilities.\n\nThat and if you are a college student and want a good paying job, you\u2019re not gonna go with Aramark. Walmart is hiring stockers for $15 an hour and all IUP can offer it\u2019s students is minimum wage.",

I once spoke with the owner of the old donut place in town and told her that she\u2019d make bank if she ran a little stand in the oak grove. She said she wanted to and tried but Aramark denies and controls every single food transaction.",

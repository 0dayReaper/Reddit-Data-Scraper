    "postText": "Anyone playing pickup or intramural soccer this summer/fall? I am a bit older and moved here with my girlfriend who works for the school. I am a goalkeeper/defender and I\u2019d like to play with anyone who is playing games regularly. I know people are distancing and I also play FIFA video games but I\u2019d like to stay in shape and be physically involved if there\u2019s a safe way to do so. Let me know! Thanks and be safe!",

    "postText": "I have two furnished rooms for rent beginning in August. The home is 3 bedrooms and 2 baths. The rooms are $2,250 per semester, including septic and garbage pickup. Utilities will be split 3 ways. Laundry is on site. I am the owner, and will be living there so everything will be nice and up to date. Under 10 minutes from campus and seconds from 422. Send me a message if your interested.",

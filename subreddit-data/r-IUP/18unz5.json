There is no list.  And so many people tried explaining that, but no, there were still more people asking to get off the \"list\".\n\nAt first I laughed, then I had to figure out how to stop the shit from mucking up my Imail.  I'm amazed that IUP doesn't have a failsafe against something like that.",

We think nothing of it.  Then, I receive an email with the Subject \"Re: Young Americans for Liberty\" and the email said: \"I like to lay in my yard making cucumber noises.\"\n\nWhat a funny phrase, right?  At least, to us Redditors.  Then someone said that this dude was being very immature, which, while true, was very funny.  That's when people realized that this Young American's for Liberty decided to send an email with the address of every single kid on campus out, which means that once someone hits \"Reply All\", we get another email.\n\nSo now, there's a bunch of kids replying to these emails, but hitting \"Reply All\", so EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON CAMPUS is getting dozens of emails that have nothing to do with them.  Lots of people are being dumbasses and are just encouraging it, and then we have the dozens of idiots that are asking to be \"removed from the list\", which is actually stupid.  There have been a dozen people that sent out an email of how to stop it, but then there are people that do things like changing the subject of the Reply All to make our filters not work.\n\nIt really has just been one massive clusterfuck.  It was funny at first, but now its just a mass of stupidity in my inbox.  I think that's about it.",

But then again it's also kind of sad that you guys can't get your shit together and be adults about it.\n\n(by \"you guys\" I don't mean you people here in this thread, just the students as a whole)",

Haven't received another email since Monday, but I'm not sure if that's just my filters on my imail holding them back.\n\nI was thinking about getting online and getting a nasty picture or something to send around to all those people that are still sending emails.  Like, one of those pictures that gives you nightmares.  But 1) I'm not sure how much trouble I could get into with that and 2) the emails have stopped and I'm not gonna be THAT guy.",

Everyone at IUP now has the liberty to email a huge list of people and they are responded to this new found liberty by abusing the shit out of it. The funniest part? The libertarians are saying it isn't their fault for not BCCing the email its the fault of everyone who hit reply all! The whole thing is basically a microcosm of the libertarian platform. ",

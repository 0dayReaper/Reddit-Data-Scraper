Classes are relatively small, i.e. you won't be in a huge lecture hall with hundreds of students.\n\nThe quality of a class is determined entirely by the professor. Some are good, some are a waste of time.",

            "comment": "Now take this with a grain of salt because I was *not* in the Eberley College of Business.  What I do know about is the labor economics of University hiring.  IUP is in the PASSHE system meaning that it is one of 14 state schools all run by the state of PA itself (this does not include Pitt, Penn State, or Temple).  The PASSHE system has a strong union for professors that has been able to consistently negotiations pay.  One of the unique things that the union has been able to negotiate is a salary band for professors.  This means that a new professor in one department is only allowed to make a certain % more than a new professor in another department.  \n\nThe result of this is that most of IUP's professors make around the same amount of money relative to their levels of tenure and experience.  This manifests itself in a very interesting way in terms of hiring: the University can afford to hire top dollar talent only in those fields that would, in a free market scenario, pay relatively less than average, and that the university is not able to offer competitive salaries in areas that are normally highly paid.  However, IUP is able to offer extremely competitive salaries to professors in other fields like Economics, Political Science, Sociology, English, etc..  This is why IUP has branded itself a liberal arts school: that's its strength.\n\nUnfortunately for those who attend IUP, business schools at other Universities are highly competitive when trying to attract the most talented professors. They are able to offer salaries that are far beyond the pay band of IUP. The result is that, on average, IUP ends up with business school professors who are on the low end of the spectrum talent wise.\n\nMy advice to you? Don't major in business at all. Major in Economics.  The average person from any given university with a degree in Economics goes on to make around 7000 dollars more a year than your average business major.  You are more likely to get hired for a better paying job **in the field of business** with an Economics degree than a business degree.  The Economics degree gives you more marketable skills, shows that you think about efficiency, and has more post-graduate educational opportunities than a straight business degree.  If going into business is your goal, major in Econ and minor in whatever field of business you are interested in (finance, marketing, etc..).  IUP has a fantastic department of Economics.  I'm doing my masters in Econ right now at a prestigious school and its been incredibly easy so far because of how well I was prepared at IUP. ",

There is nothing wrong with a state school, often it is a stepping stone to get a masters or phd somewhere else that does afford a bit of prestige if that is important to you.",

Econ majors tend to make more money after graduation, business degrees have now flooded the market and they are not sought after by employers as heavily as they once were.\n\nAlso as a grad I will tell you flat out, prestige doesn't mean shit. Most employers really do not care, at all, where you went to school. They are much more interested in your ability to demonstrate skills. My advice? Whatever you major in (but seriously, consider not majoring in Business) make sure you pursue an internship at some point and DOCUMENT everything you do in that internship.",

You need to understand that a lot of schools are more or less exactly the same. Unless you have a lot of money and can get into like, an Ivy League school, where ever you go for an education you will learn basically the same things, and employers are only going to be interested in whether or not you graduated.\n\nThe reason Economics was mentioned is because people who graduate with a degree in Economics (from any school in the country) are projected to make more money. Since you mentioned a Business Degree earlier, IDontUseJelly assumed you wanted a business degree because you thought it would applicable in the business world and help you make more money after graduating. However, right now, Economics degrees are more valuable than Business degrees.\n\nI don't know what Economics is about, I got my degree in English. I'm just trying to help you understand the college process and what to expect because I knew WAY too many people who went to IUP just because they felt obligated to go to college but didn't actually have any idea what they wanted to do with their lives, and a lot of those people were Business Majors.",

They'll ask for your room number and then send a CA to inspect the room as soon as possible. Once that's done they collect your keys (if you have any; suites with separate bedrooms have keys).\n\nThen you sign a piece of paper and are free to go. Might want to load all your belongings into your car before asking for your room to be inspected. \n\nAlternatively, (I think, it's been a while) there is a form you can sign and then just leave. The form basically says you agree to be liable for anything they find in an inspection. So.. take the extra 20 minutes to have someone look.",

It's a pretty safe bet that you'll get hit with a fee for not checking out or some bullshit like that.\n\nHonestly, I'd just go ask what your options are at the reception desk.",

            "comment": "The honest answer I can give you is that I honestly don't know.\n\nThe \"old guy that graduated\" ADVICE I can give you is to relax, and network. I say relax from the perspective of I failed so many classes and was expelled for a semester due to my grades. I came back, I regouped, and I matured.. not long after I graduated.\n\nI had a semester removed from my record and my overall GPA ended up OK, even with all the classes I failed still on my record.\n\nNetwork with the professionals around you in the know. They can advise you on scholarship eligibility and best courses of action. Don't trust them fully though, and research things on your own as well. Utilize the catalogue. I say this because my advisor wanted to force me to stay another semester despite my meeting all graduation requirements because he thought I needed another class - I had done my research and ended up having to go to the dean. \n\nPratt Hall (right next to Whitmyre) has (or at least in my time had) an excellent math tutoring program for all levels. Use it. Stright also offers tutoring to my knowledge.\n\nIf the honors college is no longer feasible just enroll regularly. You can do this, we all stumble.",

            "comment": "As a prospective student can I ask what your intend on majoring in / what areas you are thinking about?\n\nThe quality of academics at IUP varies significantly by department.  This is because in the Pennsylvania state system of higher education they are only allowed to wage discriminate between departments by a a few percentage points.  The result is that IUP can be very competitive for professors in departments that don't normally pay very highly and very lousy in ones that do.  In the end this means that the liberal arts departments tend to have amazing professors (Political Science, Economics, Sociology, etc..)  and other departments such as the Business School and the Physical / Life sciences tend to have generally lousy professors.  \n\nI was a Political Science / Economics dual major and I can tell you that the professors I had at IUP were better than the ones I have now at my extremely competitive masters degree program at a big name private school.  \n",

Maybe I'm lucky, but I've had really awesome professors in almost all of my classes (even my Gen Eds, with the exception of a County College psychologist who didn't have a real Masters...) and generally dealt only with positive people who are faculty, even if they aren't Admin or Profs.\n\nThe negative? Sometimes people are jerks. Not really surprising with a school this big, but college can bring the jerk to the forefront in people that are normally really good. But I suppose that's everywhere.\n\nAnd if you have a car, one-way streets absolutely litter the college portion of the town. As someone who lives nearby to the town anyways, I never knew how bad it was until I came here for school.",

            "comment": "I love the options. There is so many things to get into that you are bombarded with every day. Fliers, posters, student newspaper, sporting events, you name it, something is happening every single night that you can go to and be a part of. The professors are good for the most part, occasionally you will get a professor who you just can't stand but that is inevitable. I love the residence halls on campus. They are very modern, up to date and active. \n\nI study nursing here and I love the department. Choosing IUP was about where I could get the best possible nursing education at the lowest cost while still competing for my sport(I run XC for IUP). IUP provides a very good quality education for nursing. (their NCLEX pass rates are 5% higher that PITT's at a much lower cost of tuition)\n\nWhat I don't like? I don't like the reputation as a party school. It is not as big as it is made out to be. Homecoming and other holidays are a big deal and everyone does go out, but the usual weekends are nothing that crazy. There is the group of people who really like the party reputation and go wild with it. Homecoming T-shirts every year are often an embarrassment. IUP has made many advances to stop the party school reputation on campus, especially in the residence halls but it still is hanging around. Sure partying is fun but it shouldn't be what you are looking for in a school. Getting in touch/making friends with people who live off campus give you more, safer options to go out on the weekends. Drinking with hundreds of strangers on frat row every weekend can obviously lead to trouble. \n\nThe dining administration on campus has been grinding my gears a lot this year. Price hikes and other monetary things have made me think less of them. But the food on campus is great as far as selection and quality(I may be one of the few people who really like the foster dining hall). \n\nWhen I was accepted to IUP I believe I had a 3.0 in high school and scored 1150 on my SAT for Math and Science combined. Academic standards vary from what major you are accepted into. The honors college is a fantastic place to go if you have the grades to get in. I also noticed you asked about their business program, and it is fantastic. if you haven't looked on the website, take a [look](http://www.iup.edu/business/about/default.aspx).\n\nAny other questions just ask!",

I graduated in 2004 and have been successful in NYC but when the topic of college comes up I know I'm going to have to go through the \"no, not Indiana, no not Penn either, there is this town in Pennsylvania named Indiana, nope, not iupui.\" Sadly, and I hate this, but in a loud bar its just much easier, I say Pitt, especially when it doesn't matter who I'm speaking to.  I loved everything that IUP gave me, in many cases I have been way more prepared than pedigree school graduates, but the name just drives me nuts.  ",

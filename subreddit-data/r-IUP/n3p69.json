            "comment": "I'm a computer science senior minoring in Comm Media (practically what you would be majoring in for \"graphic design\", if your referring to photoshop/web design/ other adobe products) , and my basic thoughts on this field here:\n\nComm Media here I believe requires HEAVY \"external effort\" to get into a good stance for a job and to achieve relevant experience. By external effort, I mean the will and desire to work upon totally non-class related projects. My reasoning for this...\n\nMinoring in COMM, I've had to take 6 classes atleast. Here's an overview.\n\nCOMM 101 (basic intro to comm media.. deals with history, fundamentals. Hardest class I had in COMM, as I got a C and the teacher was actually strict)\n\nCOMM 150 (theory and aesthetic. Have a new teacher. Hes decent but the class is REALLY easy.)\n\nCOMM 240 (Graphic design. Had a pretty good and interesting (albeit insane sounding at times?) professor but he retired recently. Probably the class I was able to develop my skills mostly in)\n\nCOMM 405 (Game Development. I was practically one of two comp sci kids in the class, and therefore one of two that knew how to code. Many of the kids were not really able to get anywhere, and the professor was pretty lazy sounding as times. He missed classes more than most students, and laid most of the supervision to his graduate assistant.\n\nCOMM 447 (Animation. Same teacher as 405. I knew how it worked now. I probably attended only 50% or less than 50% of this class and still got an A. I \"relearned\" some basic Maya that i taught myself in 405.)\n\nCOMM 460 (Emerging Trends in Comm Media. Really like the professor for this one, who tends to be realistic yet demanding of you. class concentrates on one semester long project in terms of making proposals to clients.)\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I've met some great people in the Comm Department. But they have natural ass talent. Some pour tons of work into their classes even though its not required and some do other \"external\" projects. But the majority of the classes I've had here, are so easy compared to Computer Science. It's like they can't grade you on your creativity so they are forced to give you a relative grade?\n\nIn comparison to how competitive graphic design is as a field, I don't really suggest IUP unless your really willing to work at it without push from a teacher. I know someone who came here because he wanted to do 3D modeling and animation; due to the one professor he feels like he hardly got anything out of his education that he focused on. My roommate is also Comm Media, and hes having trouble finding an internship. \n\nIf your willing to get a masters in  (next step up from comm media) instructive technology, than you might have a possible, viable career path from here. \n",

Comm Media, while heavy on the technology focus, is not the best at handling the the design end of the equation - which is why many Comm Media students either minor or double major with the Fine Arts.  If you want design education, -minor- in Comm.  Major in Studio, with a Graphic Design concentration.  The art department puts a heavy emphasis on developing the essentials of a good designer.  Technology changes (and they'll show you technology) - but the fundamentals of design don't.  \n\nEither way, you get from your education what you put into it.  There are some great professors - and no, I doubt you will gain much from their courses if you skip half of them and think they don't require as much effort as a comp sci course.  Go Art, not Comm Media.",

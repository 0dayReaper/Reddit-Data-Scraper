Honestly, [Rent College Pads](https://www.rentcollegepads.com/off-campus-housing/iup/search) is a decent place to look to get an idea of what is available. I had decent experiences at University Square when I was there for 2 years. Everywhere that I have experienced lets you stay over break (I have never heard of a place that doesn't) and a lot will give you free summers if you resign for the next year.",

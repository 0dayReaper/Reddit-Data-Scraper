I've come here now to talk about my experience with the program to help other people decide if it is for them.\n\nOverall, the experience was absolutely amazing!  From the professors I had to the atmosphere to the people who joined this year, it was a real blast of a two weeks.\n\nStarting with the courses and professors, my experience was actually once in a lifetime, in one of them anyway.  I took two history courses for my cores, a course on civil war myths and a course on ancient history.  I liked the civil war myths course a lot more despite my liking ancient history a decent bit more than modern for two reasons.  For one, the course made the extreme amounts of white supremacy still prevalent today feel very viscerally there.  And for two, the content was a lot more streamlined, as there was a specific goal with the civil war course.  The ancient history one was an albeit interesting passion ride if whatever the prof was interested in.\nThen there's my CRISPR course.  For one, Dr. Bharathan was an awesome person with loads of stories to tell in the few times we had some down time.  What made it so once-in-a-lifetime is that this was the first year that this course existed.  The twelve of us were the first people under graduate level at IUP to ever do a CRISPR lab.  On top of that, we also got the privilege to put in around 50 man-hours as a class I to someone's actual masters thesis.  We did some absolutely amazing things in that course, and I would 100% do it again if I got the chance.\n\nWell and that's the thing.  Even though I am a rising senior, I might be given another shot at joining next summer.  Why?  Because COVID hit the program HARD after the first week.  Many people out of the 39 total had to leave across the second week.  I was one of them, although I was able to stick it through till the way till Thursday evening, so I got to do essentially everything the courses had in store.  As a result of the outbreak happening, the main coordinator for the program is giving exceptions to the rising seniors who went this summer as he believed that the experience was just not the same with all the COVID issues.\n\nThe atmosphere was always so friendly and chill.  It took a grand total of two days (not including Sunday) for everyone to learn just how well we all got along.  There was always some kind of game of pool going on, as on the fourth floor has a pool table at the center of its main lobby.  It was actually popular enough to get its own tournament as an evening activity.  Honestly, COVID brought those who stuck it through both as the different friend groups that formed as well as the group overall.\nAnd that's another thing, evening activities were always fun, whether they were councilir-led or not.  A vast majority of the campus was made available to us, and I wish that I explored more of it while I was there.\nAlso, the councilors were all so nice.  It's a shame that most of them won't be able to do SHP again next year.\n\nSo overall, the experience was absolutely amazing!  I will definitely be doing it again if I am given the opportunity, and I can't wait to see what the courses will be next year!",

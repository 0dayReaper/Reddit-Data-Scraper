It's not really a problem, and I don't care about fixing it. I'm just curious.",

With iOS 8, when you're connected to the Wi-FI, it'll show an IUP logo in the bottom left corner of your screen if you do not have a modified lockscreen (as in a jail broken device with tweaks on the lock screen.). For whatever reason, the ISP has their main location near Oregon State... Wait that doesn't make sense. Idk. Works on cellular, just not Wi-FI.",

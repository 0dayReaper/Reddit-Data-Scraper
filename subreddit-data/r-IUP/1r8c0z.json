    "postText": "Thursday I was accepted into to get my Masters in Geography at IUP, and will start classes in January.\n\nTo make this short, I'm trying to figure out where to live and want to know any major events I should know about early in the spring semester.  I'd like to live off campus for the time I'm studying for my Masters.  I'm sure more questions will pop up now that I'm going through the registration process, but I figure the living situation is pretty dire and I want to get that out of the way first.\n\nThanks!",

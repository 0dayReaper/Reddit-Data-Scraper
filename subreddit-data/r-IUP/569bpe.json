    "postText": "I'm thinking of coming to IUP from 2017/18 term. I'm from Scotland and have a few questions, so if anyone could answer them that would be grand as I'm weighing IUP up against a couple of other university's (one in Illinois, and two in Canada, one in Ontario the other in British Columbia), however IUP seems the most appealing. \n\nI've only been to the USA twice before, at the ages of 5 &amp; 10, both times in Florida, so I'm unfamiliar with the country in general &amp; especially any areas outside of there and the ones you see often in media. \n\nAnyway, my questions. \n\n1) How is the student life in this university? I will be 23 years old when (if) I attend. I see it is a small town but is there often things to do for students. And what age is the average 3rd year student (I wouldn't want to be too old lol). \n\n2) How low is the crime rate in the area? I come from a working class background so I don't mind if it's a bit rough but I would obviously rather go somewhere fairly peaceful. \n\n3) What is the cost of living for a student? Rent aside, I would probably have a disposable income of around $600 a month at the current exchange rate. Is this enough to live on comfortably?\n\n4) How is the situation for part-time work in this area (assuming I'm allowed to work on a student visa, haven't formally done anything about that yet). \n\n5) What is the quality of the humanities courses offered. I am a History/Politics student so would be doing either one of those or continue to do so as a joint degree if that is offerred. \n\n6) I read the nearest city is 'Pittsburgh', are there any closer cities and if not what is Pittsburgh like.\n\n7) Are there a lot of foreign students at this university? How am I likely to be treated by other students as a Scottish male. If another foreign student is reading this what was your experience ? \n\nThank you very much to anyone who takes the time to read and answer my questions \ud83d\ude0a!\n\n\nEdit : if this is the wrong place to post questions like this, apologies and feel free to delete.",

            "comment": "Former student here, I will do you my best to answer your questions. I lived in the international dorms for a couple of years so I have some experience with folks like yourself.\n\n1. There are plenty of clubs and organizations to join if you have a specific interest. Like most university students, IUP students love to drink so there is usually a lot going on in terms of night-life considering the size of the town. You will be on the older side as most American undergraduates range from 18 to 23, but this will most likely be the case at any university here. You'll meet mostly people in your age range if you go out to bars considering the drinking age is 21.\n\n2. There is the occasional smashed car window, stolen book-bag, or failed mugging. Relative to the rest of Pennsylvania and the United States (especially big cities) it really isn't a major issue.\n\n3. Indiana, PA the single most affordable town I've ever lived in. You can get a pint of decent Pennsylvania beer (Yeungling) for $2 at most places. Groceries are much cheaper than what you'd be used to living in Scotland. There is a Walmart in town if you want a real taste of cheap American consumerism. $600 a month should do fine for disposable income. I lived on around half and was fine during undergraduate. \n\n4. If memory serves me correctly you will *not* be able to work on your student visa but I could be wrong. I'd look that up. \n\n5. I graduated from the Political Science department with minors in Economics. I cannot speak highly enough about either department. My political science professors in undergraduate were of higher quality than the relatively prestigious international relations school that I ended up getting my MA from. They also just moved into a gorgeous new building very recently. If you end up at IUP I highly recommend courses taught by Dr. Jackson and Dr. Chambers in the PoliSci department. Easily two of the best professors I've had in either level of my higher ed, extremely willing to help students, and extremely engaging lecturers. \n\n6. Pittsburgh is the nearest major city. It's between an hour and two hours away depending on traffic.  It's roughly the same size as Glasgow, for perspective. I grew up in Pittsburgh but have since lived in DC, San Francisco, and Denver. For starters, it has one of the prettiest skylines in the US. There are great museums (Carnegie), art galleries (Mattress Factory), sports venues, and there are some really awesome neighborhoods.  Other near-by cities include Washington DC (4 hour drive), New York (6-7 hour drive), Philadelphia (5-6 hour drive), and Cleveland (close, but really don't bother). Niagra falls is also fairly close by American standards. \n\n7. Yes, although not sure who it compares to others. There is a building (Wallwork hall) where many international students stay. I'd say about 50% are Chinese and the rest are a jumble of the rest of the world including a size=able number of Europeans. You are likely to be treated differently based on your accent. Americans LOVE accents, particularly from the British Isles. You will definitely get a lot of a special treatment but dumb questions will get annoying. Also, do not underestimate how many people will immediately tell you that they are also Scottish because their heritage. \n\n",

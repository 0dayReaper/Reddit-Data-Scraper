Are we protesting tuition?  IUP has very reasonable tuition even when considering tuition inflation over the past years.  I am confused as to the reason.  Also, cost of Student Loans?  Has interest gone up?\n\n",

I was supposed to have enough for groceries for the whole year plus a new laptop (easier to pay these things off over time than one lump sum).\n\nI barely have enough for food. Luckily I got a job over the summer otherwise I'd be fucked. First world problems, I know, but fuck it, Corbetts a dick",

            "comment": "Do you need on-campus or will an off-campus job do? You can apply to work at a bunch of on-campus places. Try going to all of the colleges and talking with the secretaries, ask the people sitting at the lab desks.  There's a job board on the IUP site. I'll link to it if I get to it. There's also the HUB, the Kovalchick center, the food places... \n\nFor off-campus, I won't be much help. I worked at the Domino's Pizza that's right off campus but I wouldn't recommend there unless you get desperate. I know that a lot of businesses hire students for seasonal work. Try looking at the smaller businesses before going to Walmart, Martins, or any of the other big stores. You'll have a much nicer time working at a smaller place than at a big store. \n\nAs an aside, I've worked in pizza delivery before for a while. You can make a good amount of money in tips that you get to take home every shift. I've never done it at IUP though, so you might not make nearly as much as I did. I just thought I'd mention it, since it can be nice to have a steady stream of petty cash for food/gas.\n\nEdit: Here's a link to the official job board. http://www.iup.edu/studentemployment/jobboard/default.aspx. Just know that not all jobs are going to be here and you should still call around to see what's available. ",

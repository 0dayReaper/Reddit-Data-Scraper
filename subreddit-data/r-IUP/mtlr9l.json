    "postText": "Hey everyone, so basically I\u2019m thinking about going to IUP, but I\u2019m still not 100% sure, so I\u2019d like your input on a number of topics:\n\n1. Is it good academically? I\u2019ve heard that the majority of the student population is lazy and doesn\u2019t really care, and that the same can be said for the professors. I\u2019ll be studying geography if that makes a difference.\n\n2. What\u2019s the school spirit like? Do people care about the sports teams? Are people proud to go to IUP?\n\n3. What are the food and dorms like?\n\n4. Are the facilities and buildings up to date?\n\n5. I\u2019ll probably be paying around 18k/year. Is this a good value?\n\n6. I\u2019m not a big partier but I enjoy one every now and then. Will I struggle to fit in if I\u2019m not big on parties?\n\n7. Long shot, but do you know anything about the ice hockey club? If I go, I\u2019ll be playing for them. Do they get good turnouts?\n\nThanks so much for your help!",

            "comment": "1) Academically IUP is, from what I can tell, average. You have programs that are really good and possible in the top for their major; then you have majors that are terrible. From what I can say about the Geography department is its about average. The claims about the student population are over all true. If you got rid of all upper class men, then it would be a true statement. As with most colleges the Freshman tend to be... less productive. You'll hear the statement that \"Its easy to get here, but its harder to stay here.\" That would describe IUP pretty well. Overall, the academical side of the school is average. Wouldn't make it a huge reason to come here, unless its what you're really into. \n\n2) School Spirit is okay. Personally, I haven't gone to any sports events, although that may be more to do with COVID. The only sports teams that people really care for around here would be the football team and men's and women's basketball. Beyond that, no one really cares for sports. As to whether people are proud to come here, I would say \"No\" vast majority of people here came here because it was either the only school to accept them, or the cheapest. That being said you can still find some fanatics on game day in the Fall. \n\n3) The food quality varies. Sometimes its good, sometimes its awful. That being said there are some good selections to choose from outside of the university's cafeteria. Personally, I like going to Chick-fil-a. The dorms are really good. They are well worth the pricing and I would highly living on campus for a least one year or a semester, if its all you can afford. Dorms range from traditional single-person rooms to four persons suites that have a kitchen and living room. All of the newer dorms have a mini-fridge and private bathroom. The most common dorm is the two person private shared bathroom (Personal Room, Shared Bathroom). \n\n4)  For Geography, absolutely. My department and Geography share a building (HSS) and I can say that the HSS building is really nice and up to date. However, this isn't the case across the university. For the math department, it really shows its age and it is annoying to navigate. \n\n5) 18K? Considering that about 40% will be possibly for room; yes. \n\n6)  Not really. IUP is known for its parties; however if you don't want to party there are tons of people like you on campus. Although this might mean you'll want to stay away from the frats and sororities. \n\n7)  crimsonhawks@iupmenshockey.com  - I can't speak on this, but I would direct any questions to them here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps you make a choice.",

            "comment": "Having gone through the geography department I can recommend them. Dr. Patrick is exciting and vibrant with field trips worth massive bonus points. Dr. Seachrist is super boring, but very very dedicated to academic geography, Dr. Schaeney is cool, but boring power point class style, Dr. Oakey is boring, but has extra curricular paid data collection work for students testing water effected by frakking. Dr. Benheart is zzz but his classes move through a lot of material.\n\nSlog courses: cultural geography, history of geography, research writing\n\nEpic courses: PA geography, Urban Landscapes, whatever Dr Patrick is teaching\n\nComputer software courses: these are either a lot of work or very easy depending on who is teaching them.\n\nIUP just went through a HUGE firing phase and some of the worst geography profs got axed.\n\nThere's also a job experience opportunity for juicy resume fill ins called imaps. I worked there for my entire time at IUP, very boring, but basically everyone that graduates and works there gets hired somewhere for GIS.\n\nAll in all the dept is easy as pie, but the 400 level courses have shitloads of homework.\n\nSchool spirit is non existent, I've never even met someone that went to a game.\n\nCovid put some of the big party rager bars out of business in town, so it will prob be an all new scene out here this fall. In the past, house parties get crazy, but theres a million of them, so you can find one to go to if you ask around.\n\nOn campus dorms are very nice, food is diverse but mostly generic +chic fil a. Off campus food is decent. Look for 9th st deli, pita pit, venice pizza, Tom's pizza, commonplace coffeehouse for the secret good spots in town.\n\nYou mentioned about the students being mediocre, yes this is a huge \"problem\", but you can easily be the golden child in the geography dept with a little effort which will earn you crazy favoritism.\n\nHangups will be the English dept's forced easy/boring courses with revolving door profs and having to take a language for no reason.\n\nI cant speak to hockey, but there is an ice arena in town, but not in walking dist.",

            "comment": "Academically it is average. It is all about what you put into it really. The laziness reputation is probably true for most of the student body since its known to be a party school (which is probably especially true for the underclassmen). But I think a lot of it is about what effort you put into it. I've found very insightful and helpful professors here, as well as some boring and average ones. There are some like Dr. Mazak Kahne in history or Dr. Craig in the honors college who are really helpful and awesome at career and academic guidance. So do with that what you will. Certain departments, such as criminology and music, have a good rep and have tight-knit community around them. Others may not, but they still have people who genuinely care about the subject. After all, college is meant for pursuing your passions, so chances are you'll find someone who makes it worth it. \n\nSchool spirit is kind of meh. Like any other school, its fun when you're at the game, but once its over its not a big deal. I would go to a few games just for the experience bc the collective excitement is infectious, but outside that there's not much. \n\nFood isn't that bad. About what you'd expect. They try to have interesting meals though, and they can be worth the walk to the dining hall. There's also places like Starbucks, Chick-Fil-A, and Einstein's Bros Bagels on campus though if you get tired of it. Remember going to those places don't count for a meal swipe, so you either spend real money or meal-plan money (flex). Dorms are quite nice, but the nice ones end up being a huge chunk of your tuition. Privacy of suites range, but the most common is a two-person semi-private where you share a bathroom but have private rooms with another person. Depends on what you're comfortable living with and consider worth putting up with in a living situation. \n\nYes and no. Buildings like the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) building are new and quite nice, but others like Stright (math building) show their age and are irritating. But its not irritating enough to ruin the experience. Stright just kinda sucks tho bc its one of the farthest from central campus. There are other facilities like the HUB, which is a food court/student recreation center, as well as Fischer auditorium and the Oak Grove for campus entertainment that are nice. \n\nFor IUP, that's a little pricey, but not egregiously. Most people I know pay probably 15k or less. That cost is probably most dependent on federal aid and what dorm style you pay for. \n\nYou will not struggle. Many students are like that. You can find friends of people like that easily. My friends and I are like that, so we'd typically hang out in one of our dorms most nights and go to the occassional party if we knew someone who was there. The party scene is loud tho especially on st. paddys day. \n\nI'm useless on the last one but I think someone linked the email in a comment below.",

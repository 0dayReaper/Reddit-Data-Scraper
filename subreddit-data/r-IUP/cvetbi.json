I could see there being dicussions, memes, and posts of the likes being posted on here but it takes a community to start things like that unfortunately. I revamped the look of the sub and have talked about it around the computer science department . It stinks this community isn't more active, but I don't think I have seen an active college specific community on reddit before. I haven't been looking for one either though so I can't be sure on that one",

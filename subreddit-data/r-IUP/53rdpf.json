I just want to make sure I'm adequately prepared for when I do interviews and am developing in a professional environment.\n\nAlso do they help any with finding internships or have a bulletin board of some sort for them?\n\nAlso, what's it like living in Indiana, PA? Is it more urban or rural?\n\nThanks in advance!",

You can learn a lot from Raj (Soundarajan) and Faraag as well. I would try to avoid Dr. Ali, but for the \"bad\" professor, he's not really as bad as other people will say, you just have to do more yourself. All of them are super nice people.\n\nYou should be fine in interviews, most of the people I know that have graduated recently have quickly gotten pretty good jobs.\n\nThey try to match you with internships if possible, but I found mine myself.\n\nI really like Indiana, it's a pretty nice little town.

            "comment": "This is very late as I'm new to reddit.\n\nWhen I went to IUP, (graduated in spring 2013), here is what I found and my recommendations.  My background at IUP for reference - BS Physics, minor Math, AAS Electro Optics:\n\n* Took an online class (COSC 110) with Faraag.  He came across as very direct.  Didn't have him in person, so it would be unfair to say he is a bad professor (it might have been an early online class in 2010.) He seemed to grade fairly and somewhat helpful.\n\n* Everyone seems to say Ali is bad.  I loved Dr. Ali. [COSC 250 - Numerical Methods] He will make you work for your grade, but I learned a lot in the class.  He does have a set way of doing things, but they aren't a problem.  His demeanor is similar to Bill Murray in Ghostbusters (dry humor - but hysterical if you love that type of humor.)  He gets more hate than he deserves. I thought he was great.\n\n* Indiana PA is rural.  Roughly 13k people.  Find more than one club you like at the school.  They have several sports clubs.  Some clubs meet rarely due to low attendance (think physics club), while some (anime club) tend to be higher.  Obscure clubs like specific board games or niche topics will be very hard to come by.  Find more than one than one that interests you as they tend to only meet 1~2 times per week per club.\n\n* Out of peek season (winter break and summer), you better find a way to keep yourself entertained.  There are some decent bike trails and the gym should be open, but they can't occupy you 100% of the time.  Start some side projects, get in shape, maybe some work - if you can find it.\n\n* Good luck with internships or jobs in Indiana PA.  As far as tech goes, there won't be too many opportunities.  There should be some, but likely few and far between.  Maybe you can get a remote internship, be a TA, or do some projects to round out a portfolio.\n\n\nSome good things:\n\n* All of the professors want to see you do well.  Use their office hours - they love this and are very willing to help you! Sometimes I feel like they get bored because they have no one visit.\n\n* The department and classes are small.  Great for student:teacher ratio and overall instruction.\n\n\nI made the mistake of going to university for Physics and regretted not majoring in Computer Science/SWE.  Can't speak to the upper level classes, how much programming is actually completed, nor to the quality of the program.  You better be prepared to teach yourself to fill in gaps and create a portfolio for employers to see if you want to attend IUP.  I had a hard time getting a job after graduating.  A friend graduated in Comp Sci and had a hard time finding one as well.  I'd actually recommend reevaluating your school choice, particularly for this major.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Sorry it's a bit late, where are you transferring from? I also recently transferred and IUP uses Java for almost all of it's programming. As someone who attended PSU and Temple for different degrees, the coursework here is extremely relaxed an easy. You won't go too much in depth in programming unless you take a class with Dr. Smith. Dr. Farag is very well-rounded and a nice and fair teacher, he teaches Data Networks. Dr. Fries classes are weird, you learn a lot but he reads from slides (making class dreadful), but again he grades pretty fairly. The last two professors are hard to explain: Dr. Ali does not grade fairly and has very particular ways of getting things done. I haven't had a problem with him, but I found his teaching methods inflexible. Dr. Ezekiel is a great guy, likes talking about how famous people died, and generally accepts assignments late, but at the same time he will load you with homework (especially at higher level classes). Expect either a chapter per class of book problems or a paper or two per class due.\n\nThey have a seminar for internships once or twice a year and have agreements with many companies. I have not attended these so I can't really help much there.\n\nIMO, Indiana, PA is awful. It is completely rural, be prepared for camo everything an Walmart, your only choice for a general store. If you're a redneck I don't think you'll have to much trouble fitting in with the locals, and if you are looking for things to do off campus there is really nothing besides fishing/hunting/hiking really.\n\nI made the mistake of staying over summer and it is painful. We have a \"mall\" but it is really dead. The nearest civilization is roughly 45-50 mins away.\n\nThat said, if you decide to do the Language and Systems track it is ABET certified. Try to pick up various certifications while in school (Amazon AWS developer being a good example), they would probably help the most.\n\n ",

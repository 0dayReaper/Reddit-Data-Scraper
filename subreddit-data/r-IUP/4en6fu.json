            "comment": "CompSci department: \n\nTake Sanwar Ali if you want to bang your head on a desk, learn nothing, and get an A.  I hated this man so very much during my time there.  Pretty sure he doesn't know how to code at all.  \n\nTake Terrence Fries if you want to bang your head on a desk, learn something, and get an A.  Reads his slides.  Most you can find online from some textbook company or other.  \n\nTake Farag if you want to put some effort into interpreting an accent, learn something, and get a grade dependent on  how much work you put in.  He tends to curve the tests a bit (just gives everyone a few points back).  Scratch that, the entire department does it.  \n\nTake Ezekiel if you want to experience a class with someone who should be a visiting speaker, not a professor.  Tends to ramble a lot.  Generally accepts assignments late.  I once turned in about 15 assignments the day before the final and he gave me full credit for all of them, pretty sure he didn't even look at them.  \n\nTake Oblitey if you want another slide-reader.  Pretty sure he doesn't know how to type.  Assigned labs that were 'type this program exactly as I did', then got pissed off when we all finished so quickly.  \n\nSmith is a gem if you like a challenge and want to learn something, but I wouldn't recommend taking more than one with him per semester unless you aren't taking many credits, are really dedicated, or just hate yourself.  I learned so much more in his classes than in anyone else's.  He assigns these massive projects, but he tends to be at the university from 6 to 6 or some ridiculous hours, and he's willing to help whenever he's not teaching a class.  \n\nI never had any problems with dorms/apartments, but that's one person's experience and shouldn't be taken as gospel.  Good luck.",

    "postText": "Hi, guys! I am an incoming graduate student studying educational and school psychology this fall at IUP. I have just arrived in town to get settled in before fall courses start. Before yesterday, this is my first time in Indiana ever and would love to connect with some current students or young professionals in the area. I would love to make some friends and explore the area before classes start! Let me know if you would like to link up!",

    "postText": "Hello, fellow Hawks.  I'm a Freshman and I'm here early for CUSP.  My parents are moving away from my original home, so they gave me some stuff from the house that they didn't really want anymore.  Long story short, I've got a few computers that I don't need.  I already have a laptop that I'm using.\n\nThese computers are nice, but not for gaming (AT ALL).  The most that I've ran would be Halo: Combat Evolved.  And even that was a bit sketchy at times.  These are mostly for browsing the web, writing papers, or other basic computer needs.  The desktop that I'm selling would probably run some games at low settings if you did a factory reset on it, but that's all up to you.  Anywho, here's what I got:\n\nMSI Wind-u100 netbook^1 - [Link to Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834152066) ($100.00)\n\nHP Pavilion a6230n Desktop PC^2 - [Link to Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883107496R) ($250.00)\n\n\nIf you want to get a closer look at either of these, reply here or message me.  We can schedule a time for you to stop by my dorm and check it out.  If you know anyone that's looking for a computer, send 'em here.  \n\n^1 Black netbook; comes with a white sleeve.  I replaced Windows XP with Ubuntu, which boots much faster.  I do have the Windows Recovery Disk from my original purchase, and I'm willing to try to put Windows XP back on for an extra $20. (I'm only charging because netbooks don't have disk trays.  Makes it a bit more difficult.)  This has blue-screened me before, but not since installing Ubuntu.\n\n^2 Does NOT include any peripherals, such as keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc.  Only the CPU and everything in it.",

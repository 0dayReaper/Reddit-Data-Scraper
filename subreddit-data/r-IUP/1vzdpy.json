    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI live in a 4 bedroom house with 3 roomates on maple st and we're all graduating this spring. \n\nAnyway its completely open for next school year(Fall 2014-Spring 2015) \n\nThe rent is 2100/per semester.  Utilities are separate. \n\nIt's a nice place, about a mile from campus and furnished.  \n\nIt's on Maple street and cops never drive by(I view that as a plus)  \n\nIf you have any questions or interest feel free to message me or comment below and I'll respond as quickly as I can.

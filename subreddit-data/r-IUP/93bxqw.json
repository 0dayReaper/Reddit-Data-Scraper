    "postText": "I would just like to say that being apart of IUP's Summer Honors Program and being able to live on campus and meet some of the professors has really given me a sense of how on-campus life will be like. I have to walk from one building to another to get breakfast and then walk to my class. The Summer Honors Program is amazing and I am so glad I was a part of it. IUP went from a college I've never heard of to a college that I can see myself going to. ",

They always said the program is one of the most valuable ones for students considering IUP. I was an RA at IUP and worked all throughout housing and now I'm a student staff member with the honors college. If you need any info, feel free to reply/pm me.",

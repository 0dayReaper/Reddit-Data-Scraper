            "comment": "Hello! Unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to take part in SHP, however, I am an IUP student who works in the Honors College's Student Staff Development division. Part of our responsibilities are processing SHP requests and forwarding relevant info. Probably the most important factor in your approval to the program is not your grades, but your answers to the written response questions, so careful attention is paid to individual applicants. I'd recommend filing an information request as soon as you can. The staff will be in between 8am and 4pm, but now is a busy time of year. If you have already done this, start your application.\n\nHope this helps! PM me if you need more info!",

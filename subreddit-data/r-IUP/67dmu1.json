    "postText": "Hey guys! I was just wondering if you all know of a decent trustworthy mechanic here in Indiana. My car started leaking coolant into the oil so I'm guessing it's a blown head gasket... So the car's out of commission and I want to try and fix it out here instead of towing her back home and would appreciate the help in finding a place. Thanks!! ",

I have a washer, but it is broken and keeps tearing my clothes and other things apart Dx \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCan't really find much info on laundromats here as I think I am the only person crazy enough to submit a review for such a thing. Lol anyone know of any nice places that won't tear my clothes up ? Preferably near, or somewhat near the school?\n",

I ended up texting someone who lives in a dorm and he let me in with all my laundry.  I just sat and studied for two hours in the dorm while my clothes were getting cleaned.  Might be an option, in the future.  But I live in Pratt Studios, so I'm *really* close to campus.",

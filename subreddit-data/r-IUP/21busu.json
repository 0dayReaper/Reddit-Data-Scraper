They're quiet and practically on campus. I understand you're looking for a 1 bedroom so this might not be the best choice for you. My neighbors would feed the feral cats so we had those little bastards lurking outside all the time, which would have been fine had they not made a rest stop out of my car. It was nice living there for a year but I wouldn't do it again. Not having a full kitchen is a deal-breaker for me now.\n\nPenn State Towers [[Realty link](http://www.prudentialrealty.com/site/component/res_search/index.php?option=com_res_search&amp;task=s&amp;Itemid=145)] [no interior photos] [[Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/20+S+6th+St/@40.622407,-79.151061,216m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89cb5b26e99875f1:0xb5d511dfa2d63e34?hl=en)] : [Rent: $475 w/o utilities] : : All one bedroom apartments that are a bit dated but are in a nice location for someone who wants to walk to campus and be close to the bars. It doesn't get too loud during the weekends (street side of the unit you move into and neighbor-dependent, of course). Parking is a block away behind a lawyer's office so I didn't particularly care for that.\n\nRend Apartments [724-801-0970] [[Apartment F Interior](http://imgur.com/a/hSIn7)] [[Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/561+School+St/@40.6205149,-79.1495231,216m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x89cb5b26658d28cf:0xad8f5b0a3675d98c?hl=en)] : [Rent: $575 w/utilities, $475 w/o utilities] : : All one bedroom apartments, nice wooden floors, pretty spacious, can be noisy on weekends with people walking by. All of the apartments are different in their layout and what furnishings they come with (if any). Your neighbors will likely determine the quality of your time here but I imagine this is the rule in most communal living situations. I stayed here for two years and many would come and go, sometimes only staying for a month at a time. A couple were problem neighbors but the others were great and kept to themselves. Its location is equal distance to campus and bars so I found that to be the best part about living there. It's a mixed bag of townies and students living in the building. No on-site parking so you'll have to get a street parking pass from the municipality, which will run you $240/annually. You are not allowed to pay monthly. I never had an issue finding a space in front of the building. \n\n\n\n*edit: spelling\n",

I still have to pay $200 for a parking pass, but I think it's still a damn sight better than the dorms. \n\nI've had friends that have stayed there, and the best opinion I've gotten is that it's bearable, especially for the price. Which is fine by me, but may not suit everybody. Also, it's right next to campus, so you can walk anywhere from your room.  It's considered off campus so you don't have the stupid restrictions that the dorms have.",

At least now I won't have to park all the way out at Robertshaw and I'll actually be able to get to my car. And the biggest thing for me is that it's close to campus. I can wake up 15 minutes before my class and still make it on time. ",

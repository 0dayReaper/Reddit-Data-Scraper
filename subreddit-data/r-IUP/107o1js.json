When I emailed HR, she said that all employees are required to take it regardless of employment status. \n\nDoes anyone know if/how this is enforced? It doesn\u2019t seem legal, and I don\u2019t really feel like wasting my time to learn what I already know for the millionth time if I\u2019m not getting paid for it.",

Seems it wasn\u2019t enforced and they eventually gave up on me.",

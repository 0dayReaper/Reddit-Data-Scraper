Just about every pumpkin I saw that day and yesterday across town were smashed. \n\nI really don't mind the kids partying (I'm enrolled at IUP but I'm also 47), I was wilder than they are, and it keeps my rent down having them nearby because few people want to live near frats I guess. \n\nBut ffs, don't go around smashing up things other people have made, often with their kids, because 'you' think it's hilarious. It was my 14yo daughter's first jack-o-lantern she did herself from start to finish and it broke her heart which pissed me off. I replaced em that day which isn't the point. I shouldn't have had to replace them.\n\nSorry for the rant. I guess I'm still heated over the whole thing.",

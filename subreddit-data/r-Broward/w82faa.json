She had to resign in 2018 because of a scheme that she gave preferential treatment to Michael Ahearn; over 80% of the cases. \nHe managed to weasel his way out of it but she got destroyed by it. \n\nhttps://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-sb-judge-claudia-robinson-resigns-20180201-story.html\n\nFirstly, I would never vote for a political consultant to be a judge.\n\nSecondly, he seems to be corrupt as evidenced by the judge resigning after being suspended and reprimanded. \n\nLastly, this hit piece by an ally on his opponent screams red flag \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udce2. \n\nI think I know who I definitely won\u2019t be voting for.",

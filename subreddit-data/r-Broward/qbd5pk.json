As a Real Estate Broker,  I can tell you my clients are buying rental properties right over anything else because so many people are moving to South Florida. The influx of New Yorkers and Californians hasn't just affected the house selling market.  A 3 bedroom house for rent at $3500 is about half the price of a 1 bedroom their. And, just like home purchases,  many are willing to pay more than asking price to guarantee them the lease. It is a bad thing for locals as many are being pushed out of their neighborhoods due to rents rising. Hard to be mad, though. I don't know many people willing to make less money on a consistent bases. On the plus side, I have had a few private owners make exceptions for families. So, it's not impossible to get a livable rent, just not as easy as it once was...",

It\u2019s great for people selling or leasing property, or people like yourself brokering a sale , it\u2019s a gold mine. But for 99% of people the shoe is on the other foot. This isn\u2019t about profits, this is about peoples homes. No one cares about your investment returns. If your going to inflat rent and cost of living then inflate wages.",

                            "comment": "I hear you 100%. However,  investors are not inflating rent on a whole. While there are exceptions to every rule,  a majority of investors are only renting units for the going rate. I put a house for rent in Plantation on the market for $3k a month. Plantation is a high demand city. My property is in great condition and the showings are through the roof. I get in all kinds of offers, including offers for $3500/month. It's a good offer with great credit,  no eviction background and no criminal history. They're willing to put down first last and security.  I take it. According to mls rules I have to publicly list what i rented it for. Now, Joe up the street sees I got $3500 for my property and he wants to change his from $2700 to $3k. Even though my property is nicer,  people still want to live in Plantain. That,  my friend,  is what typically drives up pricing. This also influences surrounding areas. If rentals increase in Plantation,  then Sunrise rentals will increase as well. If I can't afford Plantation, I can afford Sunrise. So now demand to live in Sunrise increases because the people cannot afford to live in Plantation still want to live close and move to Sunrise and this rents go up. Home owners wouldn't have it any other way as the increase in rental value increases their home sale value.  It's actually one of the very few \"Free Market\" examples still left in our society. Everyone loves capitalism until it prices them out of the things they want and need. If you have Real Estate Agent working for you, they should be reaching out to the listing agent and asking what's important to the landlord. Like i said previously,  I've had exceptions made from landlords with lower offers for family clients of mine. It doesn't always happen, but some is better than none. Best of luck to you.",

The idea of being able to reach some comfort or financial security in life through hard work and smart financial decisions feels like a lie. This American dream requires an increasing level of privilege through generational wealth, luck or a combination of the two.\n\nI understand it's not any one individual or entities' fault. It's many decisions and factors that got us to this point.\n\nWhy not take the higher offer? The house next door did it. So lucky I got this house when I did!\n\nWhy not take the all cash buyer? No need to wait for lender approval! Who cares if they have a pre-approval letter!\n\nWhy take an offer that doesn't skip appraisals or inspections? I have dozens of offers on my desk, sometimes within 24-48 hours, and so many others are skipping those!\n\nThis situation, and the reverse of it, is not a good sign. I think a lot of care, analyses, and smart decision making needs to be done to keep a balance. To prevent this \"Free Market\" from being an extreme seller's market or an extreme buyer's market. So it behaves more like a bowling ball that can move in any direction on the lane, but has guard rails from keeping it out of the gutters.\n\nIt's not like we're in a truly free market, and the current setup is skewing more and more to benefit certain groups of people. I think it causes increasing instability. I don't have the answers, but I feel we can do better. \n\nI think we should aim for a society where children and their children should be better off than us. If the next generations aren't off to a good start, we're doing something wrong.",

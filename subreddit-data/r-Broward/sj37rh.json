Claps for the harsh words. Get the bullies expelled from school to do it for the governor he must be scared he ll lose a vote he can blame it on them. They'll get the job done and at least channel there anger on criminals so they want justice and learn yelling at murders is funner than victims. Win win bullies can get a education to act like the law abiding crime solving civilians by using their anger on the low lives that ruin the county increasing death.",

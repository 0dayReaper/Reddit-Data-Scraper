Coral Springs has no natural elevation, but it is a good vantage spot to see a great deal of the city. Open during daylight hours only.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This park was dedicated in 1991 to Terry McClelland, Greg Martin, and John Odem, Coral Springs residents who died together in a plane crash. They were friends who spent their leisure time together, including viewing sunsets with their families from the top of the hill in this park.",

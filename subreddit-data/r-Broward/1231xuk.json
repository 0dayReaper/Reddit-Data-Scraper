This article argues how bad transit is, so that begs the question, do we have the wrong people making decisions for transit with our tax dollars? How much more of our tax dollars are we going to give them to Misuse?",

Obviously, the pandemic dramatically impacted transit, and WFH continues to impact commuting patterns, so implementing transformative transportation options requires new approaches and creativity... which is happening and being used. The program is overseen by independent volunteer residents and audited frequently, so feel free to educate yourself before spreading misinformation and claiming misuse. https://www.broward.org/PennyForTransportation/Transparency/Pages/Surtax-Financial-Information.aspx",

The misappropriation of these funds is shameful, they could just as easily done school and park budgets better, or improved some of the roads for vehicles not to need to swerve into the bike lanes to avoid potholes and potheads.",

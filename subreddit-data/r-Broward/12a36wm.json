Gondolas are great for mountainous regions but Broward county doesn't even have hills. Before this it was the ridiculous taxi planes and Teslas in tunnels that they wanted to do.\n\nWhat residents really need is more frequent bus service and possibly light rail. I would add dedicated bus lates to the mix as well. Deveolping a continuous and safe bike network would help alleviate traffic too.",

And yes it's very hot outside in the summer, but shade makes it more tolerable. \n\nPlus you wouldn't have to bike so far if we had connected paths and better zoning that doesn't just include single family homes.",

So make sure you and those you know tell your commissioners that this is something you want. \n\nI'll give you a personal example. A while back I heard that Hollywood was thinking about expanding their shuttle service a bit further West, but not past the library (or i95). So I wrote an email saying that I would support a more Western shuttle. Fast forward to now, the city is doing a test run of a shuttle in West Hollywood near 441. So little things like a simple email or speaking to a commissioner can go a long way!",

    "postText": "This is a 2 hour boating course where you'll actually go out on the water on a boat with a USCG certified captain to learn the basics of boating and it is absolutely free.\n\nNo experience needed, 6 spots available for each course and it runs on Tuesdays!\n\nSign-up link: https://calendly.com/miamiacademy/free-on-water-boating-experience-miami?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=02222023 \n\nThis is one of 4 cities this course is being run in. The course is funded by the company Boatsetter which I work for, but I promise there will be no time-share speech. We're running this as a separate entity to become the \"Khan Academy of Boating\" aka free boating courses for everyone, forever.\n\nHere's the copy from the FB event:\n\nCome aboard for a 2-hour, hands-on experience, navigating around the Miami River. Take the helm for the first time, with support and guidance from a United States Coast Guard Certified Captain, providing you with expert instruction on proper boating techniques.\n\nNo experience needed to participate, and the best part is: it's absolutely FREE!\n\nPress link for verification: \nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220823005336/en/Boatsetter-Academy-Becomes-Largest-Free-Boating-School-in-the-U.S.",

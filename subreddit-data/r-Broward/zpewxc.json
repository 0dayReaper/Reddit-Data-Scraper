If you want something a little more closer, then DPC Vet Hospital that\u2019s on Stirling in Davie. DPC is much friendlier, but I only took my pooch for her annual vaccinations so I can\u2019t really say if the prices are cheaper overall.",

Been with them for 10 years with not a single complaint.\n\nI recently wanted to take my pup to them instead of LeadER, the 24hr emergency vet, so I waited until they opened at 7am. They advised that the symptoms required LeadER, but the fact that they not only called me half a dozen times over the next 3 days, and were proactive in dealing directly with LeadER to keep up to date with my pup for continuing care after blew me away.",

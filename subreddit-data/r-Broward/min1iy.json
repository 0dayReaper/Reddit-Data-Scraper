Those waivers allow those individuals to accept responsibility if they contract the diseases associated with choosing to not take a vaccine. Any who choose the vaccine will be protected, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re at greater risk because some are opposed. I take issue with \u201cmandates\u201d if they don\u2019t have an alternative like waivers for those with different opinions.",

There\u2019s no way of knowing if their decision will be reasonable. I don\u2019t think that means they will never make an exception In those cases where someone cannot take the vaccine due to, let\u2019s say, allergic reaction to the vaccine. But what about personal objections? A student that was already enrolled that wants to say no to the vaccine may have their case rejected by the University. Then what? Does that mean they have to possibly leave the school and transfer when other schools may not accept transfers?",

Had a very poor experience with them when trying to purchase my 2023 Toyota Tacoma.\n\nI needed a buyer's order and they kept demanding some sort of deposit and then when we gave them the deposit they sold the truck I was going to buy from them right from underneath me.\n\nI ended up going to Southern 441 Toyota in Palm Beach county to get my truck.",

    "postText": "I recently moved within Broward, only a mile from my old apartment. However this move caused my childrens home school to be changed. I'd rather have my kids attend their old school they've attended since kindergarten. They are car riders, so therefore I don't mind them not using the school bus. What can I do? What are my options?",

My next stop will be hollywood because that is where i spend most of my time.\n\nmaking friends is tough for me. I work full time from home for a company based in NJ. I   \n believe making friends will vary based on the individual.\n\nfinding things to do is no problem. It is a beautiful state with plenty of outdoor activities. It just depends on your interests and what brings you joy.\n\ncheers and good luck i wouldn't dissuade anyone from moving to this state.",

Yea there are bad areas, but as long as you stay away from them, you're about as safe as any other large metropolitan suburb type area.  \n\nAs for making friends, that holds the same wherever you go, if it's easy for you now, it will be easy for you in Broward.  Tons of people, so lots to pick from.  As for things to do, well that you will have no issue with, there is so much to do it's pretty much \"what should I do this weekend\" overload.  \n\nHollywood is a kind of laid back place, but there are definitely some rougher areas of it.  It's one of the older suburbs so that's reflected a bit in the atmosphere of it.  It used to be the \"secondary\" beach town (although a large portion of it is miles away from the ocean) next to Ft. Lauderdale, but Hollywood Beach has easily become close to as popular as Ft. Lauderdale.  It has a great boardwalk (pre-and hopefully post-covid) with live music, etc...  There is also the Seminole Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood, which some people hate but I think most people are a fan of.  It's about as close to a Vegas hotel as you will get outside of Vegas, very fun place, lots of events happen there as well.",

Hollywood is a mixed bag, as you have nice beaches and also poor neighborhoods with high crime rate. Ask your gf what neighborhood you are moving to.\n\nBut generally, south florida has a similar vibe to NYC, just a bit more hispanic",

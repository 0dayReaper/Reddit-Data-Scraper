But I think we can all agree that the fact that the southbound turnpike traffic slows to a crawl between Stirling and Griffin every single night at dusk, with no accidents, is a fucking joke, especially in tourist season with all these complete idiots slowing down to 20-30mph on the fucking highway so they can catch a video of the fucking thing.",

That bottleneck area has been that way since before the guitar hotel was there.",

Also the new Pembroke Pines exit causes the right lane to come to a stop (you're literally waiting at a stoplight on the turnpike at this point) so if you're not heading west on Pines Blvd it's best to stay in the center lane and merge right past the exit if you want to exit to Hollywood Blvd.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do find the light show interesting however. I had a free 2-night stay on floor 21 and it is really cool to see all the way out to the Everglades. I can understand the environmental aspect of it. I wonder how the sea turtles respond to it.\n\nTheir casino has never brought me any kind of luck and and the Hard Rock brand is more of a money grabber than the Seminole Casino brand itself. The food is mediocre and the fact that their food costs $2 comp points  = $1 while the Seminole Classic and Coconut Creek are always $1 comp point = $1 are total ripoffs. Their giveaways tend to be worse too. I have stopped going especially since their guests tend not to wear masks properly and it's always crowded.",

    "postText": "I know our local government is corrupt an allocates all tax payer money to big shiny stadiums and nice roads in wealthy areas but why the actual hell are the DMVs so outdated? I cant call because their lines are busy or out of service. The website is broken and doesnt work on mobile even though its 2021. The online listings are confusing and obviously not put up by our local government. There are fraudulent clones of the DMVs websites doing God-knows-what with the information your grandma accidentally enters into them. I even heard they dont take credit/debit cards?? How the hell do I get a permit test done without standing in line 3 or 4 seperate times til I get my license. I do not have time nor money for any of this and it's really pissing me off. Any help would be appreciated.",

Look here for the places you can go: [https://www.flhsmv.gov/locations/broward/](https://www.flhsmv.gov/locations/broward/) for driver's license services.\n\nThe fraudulent clones you mention are actually just franchised service centers and none of those provide drivers license services so you don't need to go to one.",

            "comment": "It's the fourth full year of a 30-year program that was significantly impacted by a global pandemic. Even with that, we've had 296 projects completed. Many, if not most, have been and on-budget, with several significantly under budget and ahead of schedule. The surtax has also helped us leverage over $100M in state, federal, and local funding sources in just this very short implementation period. As a donor county in a donor state, that's an important component of the program.We've also met and exceeded our goal of keeping 30% of the local dollars flowing into local businsses, creating jobs (many with good pay, benefits, retirement options, etc.). The surtax has fully-funded an on-demand  microtransit pilot program, community shuttles, and vouchers for overnight shift workers who can not currently access buses during the periods our system isn't running. The PREMO Plan has just been released on shows the proposed investments in premium transit and rail, in detail, over the next 7-10 years. Take a look: https://www.broward.org/BCT/PREMO/Pages/default.aspx\n\nYes, we need to deliver what we promised the voters, which we are in the roadway, bridge, resilience, and resurfacing improvements area. But when it comes transit, it will require a lot of public support and policymaker courage because there is often fear around transit and change in general. Not just NIMBYism, either. Deep-seated fear of mobility that involves anything other than cars in this county. I see tragic, critical, and often fatal accidents that are occurring on a daily across this community. The surtax is intended for County and City-owned roads, but we are also partnering with FDOT to implement congestion management and safety improvements on state roads where appropriate. \n\nAffordability of the area is also impacted by a well-developed, efficient functional multi-modal mobility system. As one of the most unaffordable places in the country, having low-cost alternatives to vehicle ownership is critical to combatting high costs of housing and everything else.\n\nIf you want to know more or get involved, watch or come in-person to the Oversight Board meetings or watch videos of prior meetings here: https://www.broward.org/PennyForTransportation/OversightBoard/Pages/Meetings.aspx",

                    "comment": "People looking for light rail - why??  The history of light rail is full of projects just like this which turned into expensive disasters.  Planners come up with inflated ridership numbers to sell the light rail, but by the time it actually gets built those numbers turn out to have been a total fantasy.  Then it\u2019s an enormously large sunk cost, so the party line becomes that people will eventually learn to love the light rail route, which never happens.  Unsupported by fares, it sucks in more and more tax money in operating costs (on top of the huge construction costs), until finally some investigative reporter writes a story about the sad history of the project and everybody finally admits that it\u2019s a huge failure which should never have been built\u2026. \n   \n**[$200 Million Ride To Nowhere](https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=130201&amp;page=1)**\n   \nTri Rail isn't light rail.  It's \"commuter rail\", which runs on existing (\"regular\", or if you prefer, \"heavy\") railroad tracks.  The only investment needed is purchasing the vehicles, which are fungible - they can be sold in case South Florida commuters don't like riding it.   \n   \nLight rail is completely different.  Instead of reusing existing tracks, light rail ***requires the construction of new tracks***.  In fact, the vast majority of the funding goes into building the light rail tracks.  And those tracks are not at all fungible.  They are permanently locked into the place they were built.  If passengers reject the light rail, there's no way to sell these extremely expensive tracks on to somebody else in another state (as one can easily do with commuter rail cars).  It is a permanently sunk cost and there is zero room for error.  \n   \nContrast that with electric busses.  Electric busses are highly fungible and in heavy demand.  Unlike regular (aka heavy) rail cars which can only be sold to users of standard North American rails, electric busses can be sold at any moment to any user throughout the world.   And electric busses can instantly be redirected to more productive routes as needed.  \n   \nIn summary,  \n   \n* Commuter Rail Exit Strategy: Sell the rail cars.  Done!    \n   \n* Electric Bus Exit Strategy: Sell the electric busses.  Done!     \n   \n* Light Rail Exit Strategy:  Declare bankruptcy, lose billions.   \n\nAnything light rail can do, the electric bus can do better.  Unlike light rail, a bus isn't locked into a fixed route and can be redirected to different routes - it can very easily respond effectively to actual passenger demand.  And a bus costs WAY less, because the massive 'sunk cost' capital requirements of light rail are avoided.  Bus costs go instead to the passenger-facing transport vehicles.  \n   \nFor any given amount of money, the electric bus is vastly more cost-effective than light rail.  It's not a question of *whether* to have public transportation, it's a question of *how*.  Light rail is a complete waste of perfectly good electric bus money.",

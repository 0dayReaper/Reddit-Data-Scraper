    "postText": "For those of you who are voting in the Dem primaries - I am looking into Ian Richards vs Dale C. Cohen for circuit judge group 30 and can barely find anything on them without paying for a newspaper subscription. It seems like Cohen's big thing was not banning same-sex marriage in Florida and Richards' thing was bringing domestic violence numbers down by 50%. Does anyone else have anything on them that could be useful to know? (Please don't be biased, give me concrete reasons that aren't personal)",

The unfortunate part is, the tipping point may come during their term.\n\nRope a dope.",

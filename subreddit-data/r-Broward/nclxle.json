    "postText": "Hi Neighbors, \n\nI wanted to reach out and ask your advice. \n\nThis morning I woke to find that my car (and about 8 others) had two immobilizers on it. I recently moved into the building and don't have a vehicle decal yet. I was told by the management company that they had recently submitted a letter in writing terminating the services with the towing company. Supposedly the letter stated that they would continue to pay the contract for the next 30 days but were requesting that all towing/immobilization services are to stop. I was told that I wouldn't have to worry about anything since I didn't have a decal. \n\nI reached out to the towing company and was told that the documentation they received from the management company ends the contract in 30 days and that they would continue to service the area. \n\nI had to pay $74 to get the boots removed from my vehicle which was properly parked and is registered with the county to that address. \nWhen I reached out to the association for reimbursement I received the following response which was probably written by their lawyers.\n\n\"The company was not instructed or authorized by the Association to immobilize the vehicles and has been terminated via letters from both the Association\u2019s management company and attorney.  The Association is not responsible for action taken by the company outside their scope of authority but if you (the vehicle owner) decide to pursue the company individually, whether through civil action or filing complaints with the county or state, the Association will certainly support its residents and cooperate with any case or investigation file.\"  \n\nMy question is what can I do to protect myself in case the rogue towing company comes through again? Looks like the management company has wiped their hands clean with the situation.",

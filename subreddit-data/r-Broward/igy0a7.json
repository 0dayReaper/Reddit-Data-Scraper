Plenty of dealerships around but people have kind of mixed experience in terms of extra fees and rudeness.",

Found the car I wanted from a huge online inventory.... it was even priced a little under [Kelly Blue Book](https://www.kbb.com) fair market value.\n\nI was offered instant financing with zero money down and a decent/affordable interest rate (considering my less than fabulous credit)\n\nThe car was delivered two days later via flatbed truck.  It was exactly as advertised... I had 7 days or 400 miles to decide if I liked the car... and had the option of exchanging it twice (if necessary).  \n\nPersonally, I will never ever use a traditional car dealership again.  Carvana was the best!",

They buy all their cars \"off lease\" so they most are 1-3 years old with low mileage. You can search their website for what you are looking for - they have lots of filters to narrow your search and carry all brands. They have Carfax for many of their vehicles, which you can review online. Some cars still have warranty left. They fully disclose and are easy to work with. No frills, no bullshit.\n\nI recommend going online to pick out a few cars you want to see in person (make sure they're at the same location) then go in person to test drive and finish the deal.\n\nNot sure about their current COVID procedures though, you might need an appointment or something.",

Put S.FL on top of that, it's best of the best.\n\nTo be honest, it's all about your negotiating skill.  Are you good at it?  If not, pay a little more at those no negotiating places like Carvanan/Offleaseonly and leave out the hassle.  If you know what you're doing and can haggle, you can get a better deal than the places I've mentioned.  To point you in a direction, Miami Car Credit....I have never bought a car from them before but have a few friends that got a good deal from them.  Like I said, are you good with negotiating?",

If the price is good, something is wrong.  \n\nIf you want a decent used car at a good price, find one for sale on Craigslist, eBay, Facebook market, or cars.com.  Buy only from the original owner and see the car at their house.  Look around ... Do they keep the yard nice? If so, they probably changed the oil.  Take a mechanic friend if you have one, and subscribe to carfox so you can run the vin to check against and wrecks that discharged the airbags.  This is the only way to find a value price on a decent car.",

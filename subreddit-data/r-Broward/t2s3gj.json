Preferably in broward but dade and palm beach are ok too.\n\n\nAlso any places with cheap drinks with also the same demographics? Thanks\n\n\nEdit: what about for Sunday day drinking? Lol",

I personally love the flagler area where there\u2019s laserwolf, glitch, and invasive species all within walking distance. Prices are average but the atmosphere is fun. If art walk is going on you can even walk down to fat village and visit C&amp;I and there\u2019s tons of cool stuff going on. Everything is about within a 15 minute walk from each other.",

Look up Glitch Bar, The Hub Spark and Roxanne\u2019s. All within a few feet of each other and FREE PARKING",

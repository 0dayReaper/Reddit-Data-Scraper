I'm what's called a \"site steward\" where I have permission to go into a natural area that is off limits to the public. \n\nThey have ecoaction days every month, which are advertised in their monthly e- newsletter. That's a good way to start to see if you're interested. Alternatively, if you sign a waiver, I am allowed to bring ppl with me to my site if you want to see what it's like. You do need to become familiar with the invasive plants in whatever area that you're working on so that you don't remove anything that you shouldn't. Different sites need different amounts of attention. And it's maintenance, so it's not like you ever really finish!",

Also contact Ann Kolb nature Center in Hollywood. Again,  not sure if they have any volunteer opportunities there, but they could probably point you in the right direction.",

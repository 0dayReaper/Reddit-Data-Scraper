Maybe if the state actually cared about the residents here and the public schools there would be smarter people contributing to the area here and then less deaths and less rage in general while driving. This place is already filled with people who can't drive correctly and it causes insult to injury with how everything is designed.",

This county has some of the biggest intersections I've ever seen. Huge 7 lane roads. And I'm not sure who is crazy enough to ride in the \"bike lanes\" with cars flying by at 45mph+",

This is a recipe for disaster, which affects drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. \n\nAnecdotally, I was hit by a car yesterday while in the bike lane.",

The best bike lanes are ones that have a physical barrier between cars and bikes, and that helps the safety of both bicyclists *and* drivers.\n\nBy the way, the YouTube channel NotJustBikes has a lot of insightful commentary about better design for pedestrian, cyclist, and driver safety, and while I don't expect south Florida to develop Amsterdam-level quality urban infrastructure, one can take note of the various little things that can be done with stuff we have now.\n\nAnd I've seen some promising signs here and there, for what it's worth.  For example, if you drive through Bonaventure Blvd in Weston, which is a pretty decently important thoroughfare, you'll notice where they put in some roundabouts.  But there's just so much more that can be done.",

A few months ago someone from Broward MPO told me to redo a section of road can take around 7 years to complete. \n\nI guess it would just be nice to see more cheap and easy road modifications that don't take a decade to complete. Maybe some of those plastic poles used to \"protect\" a bike lane, for example. Leading pedestrian intervals is an easy one too. \n\nOne thing I am very happy about is that the word is spreading that we need better streets. And with the rise of micro-mobility, the need is more apparent.",

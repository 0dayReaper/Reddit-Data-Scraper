Contact you\u2019re city government. If you\u2019re town participate with the broward county program, you can drop it off at one of the county drop off hazardous waste site areas on Saturdays. They are open 9 to 3. Find out which one is closest to you. You will need to show ID in advance, if your town does not participate they won\u2019t take it.\n\nIf your town does not pay in to the county plan, you\u2019ll need to contact your town and find out what they do. Most likely they will have a hazardous waste drop off events at certain times of the year. Find out when they are and be there.",

    "postText": "Hello, r/Broward; Happy New Year!\n\nI am currently looking for a roommate who is interested in moving in with me and another female in July 2021. The location of the apartment is in Lauderdale Lakes and it will be a 3/2. You would have your own bathroom!\n\nQuick details for those interested: My other roommate and I are in our early 20's (22 and 23 respectively). We are both chill people who would love to room with a third person to save money! I would like to room with someone whose age ranges between 20-29. \n\nWe prefer a roommate that is clean and cleans up after themselves. Rent would be between $675 - $695 a month. One of the apartment's criteria to reserve the apartment is that the roommates paystubs combined would have to equal $6300 a month before taxes.\n\nPlease PM if you're interested!",

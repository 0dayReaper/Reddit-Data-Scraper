    "postText": "Story Time (7/21/20 ~3:10am):\n\nAfter a long drive from moving out an apartment and returning home, I got back to Broward county pretty late. At 3am, I was waiting at a red light at 136th Avenue (Panther Parkway) &amp; Flaming road near the Sawgrass mall in my car. I was waiting in the middle lane and this dark skinned woman in her 20\u2019s(ish?) with a book bag, skirt, wearing a thin silver necklace walking from the median over to my car and knocked on it, seemingly in distress. I was the only car there at the red light since it was empty so late.\n\nMe being scared and not rolling my windows down, she talked to me through the glass asking for help and saying she needed to get to a gas station and if I could take her there, practically begging. I kept offering to dial 911 but she panicked and didn\u2019t want me to. She kept saying that all she wanted to a ride to the gas station and that she didn\u2019t want 911 called. I\u2019m panicking internally but after like 5 mins of her begging for a ride and me insisting to dial 911 as I could not (would not) take her, another car pulled up next to me and she went to ask that car instead. I left as soon as the light turned green.\n\nAfter calming down, I dialed the Sunrise police department, which the operator said would dispatch a police officer to check out. \n\nThis was pretty suspicious and scary.\nPlease be safe out there!!!\n\nEdit: Forgot to include that I offered her an Uber but she was like \u201cno I just need a ride to the gas station can you take me there\u201d",

But her wanting a ride was strange, considering she refused an Uber offer and wanted me to take her and was adamant against 911.",

Although that isn't a bad area, the time of night and the person seeming distressed but refusing for you to call the police is all the reason to not take a risk. Considering there is a Shell station on the NW corner of that intersection, I'd say it is very unlikely she was actually looking for a ride to a gas station. Thanks for the heads up.",

She could have walked to it in the time it's taken her to wait for/run up on cars and beg for a ride that's no more than a mile or so.\n\nGood for you on not falling for this. It could have been bad, but then again maybe she really did need a ride to the gas station.",

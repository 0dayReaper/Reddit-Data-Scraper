Also, anyone who will be 18 when the election happens in January will be eligible to register, even if they're 17 now. \n\nDecember 7th is the final date you can register to vote, December 14th is when early voting begins and the election day is January 5th. To request your absentee ballot from click [here](https://ballotrequest.sos.ga.gov/) and register to voter [here](https://registertovote.sos.ga.gov)",

There was a theft of our election. There was fraud. \n\nIt was deadly. But not because the media tells you it is but because a POS cop shit an unarmed woman without warning. \n\nProtesting is a constitutionally protected act. Much like the fake media said the summer riots were. \n\nHalf this country - and I believe a lot more than that - is waiting for accountability and believe it will come.",

Typically, the media jumps at the chance to point that out.  \n\nInstead it says \u201cformer employee\u201d, which means this guy could\u2019ve been a janitor, records clerk, fleet mechanic, dispatcher, firefighter, paramedic, evidence tech, drug lab technician, or a thousand other non-Cop positions that BSO employs. \n\nThe fact that the media didn\u2019t specifically point out his role makes me lean more toward the idea that he wasn\u2019t a cop, but they want you to think he was in their headline.",

You can register here: https://registertovoteflorida.gov/home\n\n##Voting in person\n\nFlorida offers early voting from October 29th-November 5th, and some counties may choose to offer additional dates.  Find dates and locations at [your county's Supervisor of Elections website](https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/supervisors/).  \n\nIf you prefer, you can vote [at your polling place](https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/check-your-voter-status-and-polling-place/voter-precinct-lookup/) on Election Day, November 8th. \n\nWhen voting in person, [be sure to bring an accepted form of identification](https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/voting/election-day-voting/).\n\n##Voting by mail\n\nAny voter in Florida may choose to vote by mail.

    "postText": "Hi. I recently renew the license registration for my car. The address was wrong so it seems the Registration never got to my house.\n\nI requested a copy of the Registration at [gorenew.com](https://gorenew.com) and it already arrived but it seems they don't send the Decal again. What options do I have to request the Decal to put it on my license plate?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* update 09/26/2020 \\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo far, I found there's a way to fill in an application for a replacement in link below. I'll use the \"Lost In Transit\" option as I never received the mail. However, it doesn't say where I'm supposed to send it. I guess to a driver license office. By Mail?\n\n[https://www.flhsmv.gov/pdf/forms/83146.pdf](https://www.flhsmv.gov/pdf/forms/83146.pdf)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Now, I don\u2019t know if I was just lucky or if it was because the police are using \u2018cameras\u2019 to read the license plates(to check reg., insurance, etc) instead of looking for a sticker.\n\nI tried getting another sticker online, but I couldn\u2019t so if you really want the sticker you probably needs to go to the drivers license office(with its \u2018small\u2019 line) and get one there, but I can\u2019t say that for sure.",

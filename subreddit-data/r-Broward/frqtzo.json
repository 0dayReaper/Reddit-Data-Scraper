In fact due to economies of scale, everything you named has a higher cost per joule than standard fossil fuels, so it's arguable even farther away from being 'free'.",

Sure when the market is going stupid. Price of oil is a joke right now. Everything is a joke. Countries are competing with each other for market share. It's all business. These fossil fuels are not going to last forever. \n\nNot disagreeing with you at all. I complete agree, the cost is too high right now for renewables to be effective in a country our size and the population centers scattered about. Our infrastructure is old and weak. Needs MASSSSIVE amounts of investment to bring things up to scale and \"future-proof\" ourselves. Lots of land out there that can be used for solar or wind. It's the money that says when it gets built.",

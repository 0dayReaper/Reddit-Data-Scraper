Facts, evidence, and logic are discarded for feelings, beliefs, and propaganda. \n\nHow is it logical to believe that in today's society \"access\" to information comes from a school library? How is it logical to believe that banning books keeps children from knowing that they don't feel right in their own body or have attraction to the same sex? How does it change anything for the better? All we are doing is normalizing bullying \"others\" just as we did for decades. \n\nI grew up in Fort Lauderdale and experienced horror as teenage boys would get bats and chase men coming from gay clubs. Boys who appeared effeminate at school were tortured by the jocks. And crossdressing? Well, I have had 2 relationships with straight men (athletes) who liked wearing women's clothes occasionally but lived in fear of being found out by friends. Imagine what it's like for people who can't conform. Who can't avoid being tortured. Do we want to live in a society of hate and fear? What are we even afraid of? Why do I have a role in deciding how another person exists and experiences their body or sexuality? And if that person is a child living with small-minded, fearful parents, do you think when the child has its first opportunity to receive acceptance and love elsewhere it will turn out well? How do you think kids get abused by adults? They are looking for the affirmation they don't get at home. Can they go to school and not be bullied at least? I mean, we don't care about them getting shot at, so why do we care about books that don't have the information purported in them and that no kids are even reading? I have kids...they don't read books unless forced. And what's on the internet? Are you going to ban all that?\n\nIt's just ridiculous pandering to a base that sees solutions where problems don't exist when real problems continue getting worse.",

He's in middle school and that book (a completely different one from the one I mentioned) is rated for older teens, which happen to be in middle school.\n\nIf you don't want your kid(s) to read books that are sexually explicit, teach sex ed, or address LGBTQ+ issues, that's fine. Actually do the work to parent your own kids and moderate what type of media they consume and let other parents do the same for their own kids.",

Some earlier in life than others. If and when that happens, it's important they have resources available to help them sort it out. It's also important to educate others so they understand what that experience is like. It can be confusing, And with people like you in the world - scary.\n\nSome books, which you claim to \"expose children to LGBTQ ideology\" are one of the resources that can help them better understand what they are going through - and help others who do not share that experience, empathize with them.\n\nIf you're going to claim to care about protecting children, maybe consider including those that are questioning or transitioning their gender identity.\n\nI'll also add - no advocate of trans youth worth their salt would call for children to undergo gender reassignment surgery or hormone replacement therapy. Social transitioning should always come long before anything else. If a teen seeks hormone replacement, they should be encouraged to seek psychotherapy and health screenings before making such decisions.",

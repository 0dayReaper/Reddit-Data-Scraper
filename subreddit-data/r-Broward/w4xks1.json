I'd love to say that we are such a fair society and blah blah blah, but largely, through social economic networks and, even exclusive legacy laws such as redlining, and an uneven GI Bill, there has never been anything impeding wealth accumulation for the white landowner and we see the vestiges of this today in our Public schools and zip code discrimination.",

Teachers have started to rely on this additional money in their checks especially with inflation and how expensive it is to live in Broward. Yes money is going to school security but it is also going to teacher retention. As someone has pointed out previously BCPS has a breakdown of where the money is going. This referendum money has to also be split with the charter schools.",

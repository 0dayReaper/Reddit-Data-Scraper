I recommend driving around neighborhoods at different times of the day to truly see. Very mixed area.",

Runner up in the area is  \"Cypress / Cb county\" both misleading names for the area just South of Atlantic and Dixie on the West side going to about McNab.\n\nGood - Highlands , the area just North of Sample and East of Dixie. Runner up is probably North part of Cresthaven.\n\nBetter - Old Pompano , South of Copans to Altnatic on the East side of Dixie runner up is the real Cypress Area of Pompano , South of McNab , Lyons park mentioned by another user is part of this.\n\nBest - for actual city limits Palm Aire , the area South of Atlantic and West of Power line stretching South to McNab if you like an older crowd, any place East of Federal on Atlantic if you want to be by the beach. Lighthouse Point is its own city but is an excellent choice this is the area East of Federal from NE 48th Street down to around Copans.",

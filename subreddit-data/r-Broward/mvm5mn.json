    "postText": "Hey All. Looking for a place to go next weekend for my wife's birthday. It would be our family and a few other couples with kids. I would love to find somewhere that we adults could sit and eat and enjoy while the kids could play on the beach. It could be something moderately expensive down to a tiki bar with decent food anywhere from Boynton to Ft. Lauderdale. Don't want to be too far from the kids since they are all relatively young. For instance, places like Oceans234 is across a boardwalk and a large patch of seagrapes from the beach in Deerfield. Ideally, looking for a place that's toes in the sand. Do your thing reddit!",

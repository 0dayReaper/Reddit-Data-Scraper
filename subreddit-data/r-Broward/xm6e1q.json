Because she was suspended and not removed AND school board members start their terms before the Governor\u2019s term ends, DeSantis could remove Korn if she wins even if he loses. \n\nDo not vote for Donna Korn, unless you would like another DeSantis hand picked replacement.",

I don\u2019t know why she thinks she\u2019s any different from the other school board members that were in her same position. But I am also not thrilled at all with the other candidate in the race. A lot of people think that he is disingenuous. I wish Raymond Adderley would have won- he would\u2019ve been a breath of fresh air. Anyway I\u2019m not going to vote for Korn, I\u2019ll vote for the other guy, but I won\u2019t like it.",

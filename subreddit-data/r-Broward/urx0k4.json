I\u2019m from a small town in New Mexico so this is a big change for me, we moved here for my job. Is there anywhere you suggest us going/seeing? Anything to be aware of in terms of weather, food, people, etc? And any advice or suggestions you think might help the transition?",

The best place to watch manatees (during winter) is in Birch state park in FLL. Food in Broward is actually pretty great, so many different cuisines, and many restaurants are really good. Be aware of driving on I-95, especially towards Miami.",

Go paddle boarding and kayaking.   \nGet out and DO some exercise while it is still cool enough to be outside, before the summer swelter kicks in.  \nJoin running or bicycling groups. Florida is flat, so bicycling is good. However due to bad traffic and terrible drivers it is best to bike well after the daytime traffic madness.  There are a number of local bike groups organized through Facebook that bike in the evenings, in groups for safety.   \nThe key to life in Broward is JOINING groups that getting out to DO things together. Otherwise it can be a very lonely place.",

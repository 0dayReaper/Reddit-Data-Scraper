So you're talking 8 years of school to become a pharmacist, the reason they are in high demand is because most people aren't thinking of 8 years of school to get into a job starting at 50k a year.\n\nTelling someone that is looking to start at 50k a year that they could make 140k a year if they were a doctor, I mean thats not really straight advice.",

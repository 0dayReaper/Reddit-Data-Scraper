            "comment": "There are a lot of rinks and ~~they all~~ most have adult leagues. It really depends on what area you are in and what level you play at. I play in the lowest league at Pines ice now and it\u2019s pretty good and decently organized. I used to play at the den and even though it\u2019s the Panthers home rink they have some organization and scheduling issues with their adult leagues. It\u2019s still a good option though and I have friends who still play there. Glacier (Rink on the Beach actually but it\u2019s not on the beach and will always be Glacier to me) is a hot ass mess management wise but I know some guys who play there and are happy with it. \n\nI have friends who play at Kendall but I don\u2019t think they have an actual league and it\u2019s just open hockey. My son just started doing clinics at Boca and I have seen adult games on the second sheet that looked like an actual league. I have no idea if they\u2019re good or not but it\u2019s a new facility and is pretty nice. West Palm has an Olympic sized sheet and I know they have games but I\u2019m not sure if they have a league or it\u2019s just privately organized skates and/or open hockey. The Panthers are in the process of converting the old War Memorial to their new practice facility and will have leagues but the opening has been pushed back several times ready. \n\nIce Den and Pines are already a few games in and teams are independently run but I\u2019m pretty sure the league will help find you a spot if you ask. I don\u2019t check messages here all the time but I\u2019ll keep an eye out. \n\nYou can DM me if you\u2019d like. I don\u2019t always check messages here but I\u2019ll keep an eye out. Good luck!",

Others have AT&amp;T, though whether they offer anything that classifies as modern connectivity will differ (you probably want at&amp;t fiber). There is also bluestream in coral springs and weston. Im not aware of any other providers.\n\nYou can also try to grab a promotion from xfinity. Sometimes getting tv+internet can be cheaper than internet alone. Just watch out for thr broadcast and \"regulatory\" fees. Theyre variable and total bullshit.\n\nLastly, if you actually DO have options and therefore leverage, you can call and bluff about canceling your service and try to get routed to the retention department. They have access to promotions nobody else in xfinity dors. Its a fucking hassle though.",

They don\u2019t tell you that it is a promotional price so 12 months later your bill goes up. If you don\u2019t say anything they keep billing you at that higher rate. What I do is I switch back and forth between att and xfinity every year. If you call and complain and say that you are gonna switch service sometimes they give you the promotional price for another 12 months too. \n\nThis is only my experience with these companies as a consumer and may not be the reason for your high prices.",

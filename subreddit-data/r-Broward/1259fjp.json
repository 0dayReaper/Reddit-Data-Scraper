    "postText": "I\u2019ve only ever dealt with FPL b/c I\u2019m in south fl and this is the only power company. For as long as I\u2019ve been paying bills the electricity bill is in the $180-200 range and apparently no one else really experiences this! I have my tvs on sleep mode, I don\u2019t sleep with any lights on, and my a/c isn\u2019t piping in the 60s like a lot of other ppl I know. I don\u2019t even like it cold! The only time my bill is less than $150 is in december when it gets no action! \n\nNow heres the real problem that\u2019s making me feel like \u201cis it me????\u201d \n \nI downgraded to an apartment that had no washer&amp;dryer and no dishwasher\u2026. So how is it possible that my electric bill isn\u2019t going down?? Are y\u2019all really using surge protectors and unplugging your appliances at night like they suggest we do to save money?? \n\nHELP ME! I want a $100 bill like everyone else!!",

If so, you can get a smart thermostat and program it to set to 80 for a few hours, then go back to normal a couple hours before you get home. It helps...a little. Also, if you can tolerate it, raise the temperature a degree or two while you are there, in conjuction with using a fan. A decent fan makes a room feel a couple degrees cooler.\n\nThat said, I agree with other posters that you should have FPL examine your home. Your bill is too high. I have an ~1,500sf single-family house. I am averaging about $150/month.\n\nYour high bill could be many thing, but I'd imagine it is likely something up with the a/c or a large appliance, or an insulation issue. I have one room that gets direct sunlight through a glass door and it is always so hot. No amount of curtains helps. My a/c works overtime just to make this room tolerable. Luckily the fan there is great. Owning a home, I have really started noticing how little builders consider climate and orientation when designing a home. A lot of cooling problems in homes are because of bad design.",

You def want to check your windows to make sure they\u2019re sealed correctly. Consider adding reflective film or something that helps with heat/UV to the window panes.\nAlso if you\u2019re on the top floor of a condo, that one is usually more effected by the warmth of the sun beating down on the roof. That\u2019s why I chose to purchase on the ground floor.\n\nBack when I got my first place I was paying $250-$300/m for electricity\u2026 Luckily it was split by 3 because I was in a 3 bedroom with roommates but the a/c was really old and on the 2nd or 3rd year we started having major issues and leaks. To the point it was eventually replaced and to my surprise, my bill went down drastically. I think it was below $150 and this was 10 years ago. So you could imagine how important it is to have a properly running a/c.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t necessarily believe in the whole turn your a/c off during the day type of thing anymore. It seems like you\u2019d be saving energy but in the long run, you\u2019re just letting the temperature rise (let\u2019s say) 5 degrees and then when you have it set to go back on, the a/c is having to work really hard for however long (maybe 30+ minutes) to get it back down and could lead to freezing the unit. Whereas it would just kick on every now and then in order to maintain the temperature instead. \n..Of course I don\u2019t have any scientific data proving that\u2019s the BEST way but I\u2019ve also spoken to a/c techs, including my father, and they seem to agree as long as you don\u2019t have any windows or doors open -for obvious reasons.",

Read how much electricity is used.  Then turn it on for eight hours and use hot water.  Compare those numbers.\n\nFor plug-in devices, an inexpensive Kill-A-Watt is quite useful.  It can also measure kilowatt-hr consumption for a given device.\n\nFor example, we used one to identify a refrigerator that was about to fail.  It was consuming three times more energy.\n\nNobody can say or even suggest anything useful without relevant numbers.  Your electric bill also lists the kilowatt-hours consumed.  That (an not the $ number) makes possible better informed replies.",

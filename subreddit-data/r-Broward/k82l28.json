            "comment": "you can foster kittens from the Broward Animal Care and Adoption Center. You get 40 hours for fostering a kitten for 4-6 weeks. they give you the food and litter. you save a kitten that would have been euthanized, you don't have to worry about keeping them bc they are country property and they go back to them when you are done (unless you decide to adopt through them) , you get hours that are approved by broward county schools, and you don't have to worry about covid. my recommendation is get 2 that way they keep each other company. 2 is actually easier than 1 kitten because 1 requires way more human interaction and attention. if you have any questions just message me. I've been doing this with them for over 9 years (started my freshman year of high school)",

You can be trained as an animal handler and work with gators, parrots, turtles, fish, etc. You can learn a lot and get into the occasional IMAX movie premier for free.",

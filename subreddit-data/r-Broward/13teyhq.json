    "postText": "Im looking for recommendations for a nail person / tech that does either nexgen or gel x nails, pedicures are a bonus. Im looking for someone that does a great job and is very clean.  My current nail lady is on maternity leave and will be out probably a year or more. She is meticulous and is very clean with the tools, work area etc. She\u2019s phenomenal and to be honest I\u2019ve gotten used to that. I\u2019ve tried a few nail places that had high reviews (including cleanliness). They were very dirty and the quality of work just wasn\u2019t there. The last place I went used the same tools on my feet as my hands. I\u2019m fairly certain the person was using the same tools all day on everyone without disinfecting. \ud83e\udd22  If you have a nail person that is amazing and clean too, I\u2019d be grateful if you could please send me their contact info. I\u2019m near Sunrise. I\u2019m willing to drive up to 30 minutes away. Thank you!",

The City Commision will have a final vote on the ordinances on March 2nd. \n\nThese changes would put a huge dent in the business of Fun-n-Sun, The Bike Shack, etc. \n\nPersonally, I think the city should be a much more concerned with the amount of trash, including nasty cigarette butts, littering the Broadwalk, seawall and sand. My friends and I are constantly cleaning up behind people.  \n\n[https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/hollywood/fl-ne-beach-ban-hollywood-vote-20220217-dy3iljcosfeajk3usn53epbshy-story.html](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/hollywood/fl-ne-beach-ban-hollywood-vote-20220217-dy3iljcosfeajk3usn53epbshy-story.html)",

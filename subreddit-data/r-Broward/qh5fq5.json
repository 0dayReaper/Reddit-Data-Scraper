    "postText": "Short story\nI'm looking for an apartment til I can buy a condo I really want. I'm not 55+. I need a clue.\n\nLong story\nSup folks.. so, I'm hunting for a condo (to buy, of course). Everytime I do a search, I run into 55+ communities. I figure I need more time so, I'm looking for an apartment to rent because I've been at this hotel in Weston since August, from Colorado (originally from NYC).\n\nI've been working with a broker for the last 3 weeks and I don't think she understands the assignment. When I want to see something I like, something that she sent to me.. boom 55+.. so why tf are you sending me senior community stuff? I'm 42. \n\nCan I get some tips on HOW to search to avoid all these 55+ condos? Useful websites? Any brokers that understand the assignment? Is there something I am ignorant about? I really feel like there's a clue I seriously haven't picked up on.\n\nNow, I'm picky with buying but not so much with renting. However, my issue is, I don't have a job, I own a business and multiple properties. I have bank accounts with actual liquid cash ready to spend. I haven't had a paystub since 2006. Credit score sits at 749 last I checked (might be lower as I've taken on some secured debt). Landlords treat me like I'm lying.. wtf!? I've only had this kind of trouble since I came to Florida.\n\nAny help is appreciated.",

Did you want to be within walking distance of the beach, or did you want to be 11 miles inland? Are we talking Hallandale or Lighthouse Point or Plantation or by the Galleria mall? It's a very large county, and in my experience, a realtor experienced in Emerald Hills and Orthodox Jewish couples isn't going to be useful to a Venezuelan family looking for a 3/2 in Weston, or a LGBT couple looking for a luxury pad in Wilton Manors.",

I'd like to be near Weston, Cleveland Clinic specifically for my mother's sake (live in USVI). But it's not a requirement. I did like the Hollywood area but I do have family in Plantation along the 441. It would be cool if I could be near them, close to where 595 meets 95.\n\nI'm a single guy looking for something simple. I only require that it be clean and not look like the hurricane started in the apt. I do prefer apt buildings, at least 3 or more floors. \n\nAnd thank you",

I was thinking about posting in r/Miami as well but I bet I rather focus on Broward, lower half. \n\nFurther east doesnt sound bad at all. I do like that Hollywood area. Being single, close to the water might give me an extra \"half-a-half-a\" point lol. I'm not worried about a daily commute. \n\nThank you. These are the clues that I need.",

The new Metropica(?) building is $$$ lux condos. There\u2019s also a few newer buildings in the corridor between Pine Island and University in Plantarion, roughly between Cleary and 595. \n\nShould be plenty of older buildings in Davie around Nova, especially west towards Pine Island. Could also buy a cheap trailer and hope a storm doesn\u2019t come along.\n\nThere\u2019s a couple of condo complexes in the north western part of Weston, but I haven\u2019t looked there because I don\u2019t like Weston (endless Suburbia lacking in culture/flavor).\n\nPretty much anything along 441 south of about turnpike is a little \u201cslummy\u201d, most things south of 595 are a bit weird on top of that.",

She has a large but attentive team and sells a lot of Shenandoah which is a community of homes in the 300s-700s in west Davie just east of Weston. 5 minutes from the Cleveland clinic, near ikea sunrise. There\u2019s some apartments right off flamingo road across from the childrens library that might work which I\u2019ve always found cute, and plenty of similar ones in parts of Plantation too. Plantation especially has nice parks and city facilities, Sunrise and Davie do too. They\u2019re relatively modern cities, most of it\u2019s built well after 1990. Weston is a bit more of a premium town, because it\u2019s manicured like Disney World, it\u2019s a planned community developed by Arvida in the early 1990s \u2014 as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen. Too close to 95 and 595 it gets pretty industrial with the airport and port Everglades right there, but there might be secret gems to find.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to have a budget in mind, and move quick when you find something - as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, the housing market is crazy down here - so I\u2019d imagine the rental one is similarly nutty. Unlike much of the US, there isn\u2019t much open land left to build on in Broward because we\u2019re right up against the Everglades. 20 years ago it was a different story.",

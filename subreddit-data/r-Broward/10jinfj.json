            "comment": "The last major push for a transit project (other than bus) was a streetcar in Ft. Lauderdale called The Wave, which was envisioned as being the first leg in a county-wide network. Local anti-transit activists, armed with copy straight from Randall O'Toole of the Cato institute, mobilized to kill it.  Attending the meetings was a real eye opener regarding how closed-minded and invested in the car dependent paradigm a lot of the population was. \n\nOf course, enough time has passed now that a lot of the vocal  opposition may have exited the political stage (RIP), and residential density in eastern Broward has increased in recent years. What's more, there's Brightline and talk of a second commuter line on the FEC tracks. So, conditions may have changed such that the voting population is more amenable to a multi-modal transit system.",

Maybe it could have started a better transit movement in Broward. \n\nBrightline is very nice, glad they are expanding their reach with more stations. And I've heard about the possibility of more commuter rail on the same tracks. Would be very interesting! Overall there seem to be some small improvements, here and there. They just have to follow through. \n\nI'm also hoping the bike infrastructure improves. It's pretty discouraging right now.",

Better running buses, separate bike lanes, and a good rail network. A system of pedestrian flyovers can also exist to help when crossing large roads. Yes, it\u2019s hot and it rains, but shaded bus/train stations are possible. I live in the Pacific NW nowadays, and many of the suburban areas are super accessible due to good public transport. Areas that are built like West Broward are an hour ride from the urban core on the rail. There\u2019s also heavy rail connecting smaller cities to larger ones. \n\nAs far as building more dense housing, I feel like that\u2019s a necessity. South Florida already stretches too far into the Everglades, and vital coastal habitats like mangroves and coral reefs have taken a pretty big hit due to the urban and suburban sprawl. These areas acted as natural barriers to flooding, and with climate change looming over us, expect more flooding. Building dense urban areas surrounded by massive green habitats and nature preserves is the only way to build in SFL. Unfortunately the damage is already done so what can we really do?",

The problem is politics.  I\u2019m not talking about left vs. right, Republican, Democrat, Green, whatever.  I\u2019m referring to local politics of each city or township and what they want or don\u2019t.\n\nTrains and commuter rail only work for a select few.  One of the issues with it is that it takes as long or longer to reach your destination.  This is because of 1) sharing the rail with freight and 2) every politician wants a stop regardless of whether or not it makes sense.  The second issue with it is the secondary mass transit feeders like bus lines - they are horrible.  Every politician wants to implement it. But wants someone else to pay for it because they know it can\u2019t support itself economically. \n\nTo give you an example of this, I took public transport  from West Pembroke Pines to Fort  Lauderdale Airport (FLL) and it took me the better part of 3 hours with a change at Sawgrass Mall.   It is far more efficient to take a car whether a personal car, Uber, or taxi.  \n\nMost of the population lives outside of any so called dense urban environment to make multimodal transportation feasible.   This is why the Wave failed and why Metro Rail never expanded past where it rolled out after 30+ years.\n\nLet me make it clear, that it\u2019s that I\u2019m against it, it is that people are trying to apply what works in cities like NYC to SFL and don\u2019t understand why it doesn\u2019t work.",

Why does it have to be that you need a car just to do groceries? If zoning laws changed, we could have more convenient places nearby, instead of endless single family homes. Not to mention that it's very unfair to a lot of people who can't afford to buy a car; or the disabled. I also understand that maybe this idea could take decades, people aren't going to sell their homes that easily, and Broward isn't that interested in doing this right now. \n\nAlso, buses could run more often, with more convenient stops.

But what do you think cities looked like before cars were around? Yes, it could take decades, but I don't think it's a waste of time. We need to make South Florida denser anyway, we've already reached the everglades with our suburbs, and with more and more people moving here...\n\nI wouldn't say it's about it to be revolutionized... It's not like everyone will be able to afford a self driving car, if they even get that right. It's hard to make cars fully autonomous. The ones that do work decently, can only do so in relatively small, mapped, areas with expensive lidar. It's just not feasible for everyday people yet.",

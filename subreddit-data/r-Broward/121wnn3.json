    "postText": "Hi everyone,\nI am a reseller and I have a vintage jacket for sale that has a logo for Shooters Yacht Club in Fort Lauderdale and I was interested in doing some research on the place just for the history since I'm selling the jacket. I've been unable to find any info whatsoever whether it ever even existed. The only thing I've run across is a vintage tee shirt that was sold on an obscure website with a similiar logo. Due to the tragedy at Shooters Waterfront any Google searches I do get overtaken by articles about that incident and place. Does anyone have any info on this Yacht Club at all, preferably dates of operation? Thanks so much!",

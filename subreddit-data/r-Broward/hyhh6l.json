My friend wants to help give back to juveniles and assist in the rehabilitation of juveniles. I am not from Florida or live in Florida, I just see her passion for helping others and want to help her. She only has a degree in business. Any tips on where to look? She is a very good employee and willing to work her way up through a company and further learning and obtaining other degrees to do so.",

    "postText": "Hi and hello -\n\nNot sure if this would be considered advertising or if it's fair game - apologies if it's considered so.\n\nBut I just wanted to briefly mention that a feature film that I was a part of producing is playing this upcoming weekend [(Sunday, April 16th) at Savor Cinema](https://savorcinema.eventive.org/films/63f7c667c56d40029f94d5da). 1 PM. The creative team of the film are all South Floridians and they'll be present following the film - director Justin Zuckerman, star Isadora Leiva, and production designer Natalie Montoya.\n\nThe film will also be introduced by Sandy Lighterman, the Broward County Film Commissioner.\n\nWhat's the film? It's called YELLING FIRE IN AN EMPTY THEATER. It was a selection at the 2022 Slamdance Film Festival and was recently picked up by Fandor/Cinedigm.\n\nWe've been doing a kind of roadshow with the movie, and are excited about hitting our home state of Florida this month. The film has sold out showings in Jacksonville, as well as in Brooklyn, New York, Chicago, and elsewhere around the country.\n\nThere are really not too many good ways to get the word out about a small movie like this anymore - thought I'd pop on here just to let you know the movie exists, in the off-chance it happens it might be to someone's taste who can go.\n\nThe movie is something of an homage (and kind of a satire?) on the 'mumblecore' movies of the 2000s - it was shot for $2.5k on a miniDV camcorder, in a Brooklyn apartment whose rent was more than the entire shooting budget. It's an often-absurd comedy about a young woman who moves from FL to NYC and gets entangled in the crumbling relationship of the couple she moves in with.\n\nWe've had [some](https://www.talkhouse.com/striving-for-amateur/) [good](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/cinedigm-acquires-yelling-fire-in-an-empty-theater-1235493763/https://variety.com/2023/film/news/cinedigm-acquires-yelling-fire-in-an-empty-theater-1235493763/) [press](https://inreviewonline.com/2023/01/20/yelling-fire-in-an-empty-theater/) [and](https://moviepudding.substack.com/p/new-york-i-love-you-but-youre-bringing) [reviews](https://thefilmstage.com/tag/yelling-fire-in-an-empty-theater/) for the movie, and if you're an aspiring filmmaker or just someone who enjoys small movies, I think you might like it. You can use the code Yellfire2023 if you want a discount on your ticket.\n\n[Here's the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hbu0o163-H4).\n\nThanks for taking a peek, friends!",

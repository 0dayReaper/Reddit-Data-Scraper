It's not about learning. It's not about testing. It's not about doing what's best for the kids. It's about being a free day care service.",

I thought that was weird to say since it seemed obvious.  Now i know why he was saying that!",

They talk a lot of shit about science, stats, and facts then proceed to make policy based on feelings and fear. This year killed my support for the Public School system ini Broward. Next year is Charter, without doubt.",

But she envied her friends at Stoneman Douglas because of the size of that school and its facilities.  Small schools can be a social drag.  Just bear this in mind - not all charter schools are the same.  Do your homework (so to speak) on the one you have in mind to see if it performs at least above state averages.",

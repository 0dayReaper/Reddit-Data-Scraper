Parents don't make enrollment decisions based on teacher quality, so having anything other than a warm body is totally optional. Any teacher shortage you see can be ended at will by the state because they control licensing and hiring requirements. No matter how bad it gets, its probably preferable to fast food or retail and there is no mechanism preventing standards from being lowered that far. Already this is the case practically for charters and private schools.",

We need everyone to take all the steps possible if we want to defeat the virus and its many mutations. Mask, vaccinate, distance, sanitize, etc...all the steps have to be done together by everyone or we'll never be rid of the new variants. While Americans whine that masks stop their ability to be free, and spread misinformation about vaccines, other countries are getting vaccinated and taking precautions to keep their people and economies strong for the long haul. They'll be back to booming economies while we're still begging idiots to get vaccinated and social distance for their own protection. It's like we're living in a sequel to the movie Idiocracy.",

By all means respond again so I can continue to dunk on you with actual facts.",

It's pricey but they have a bar area, well-dressed, people are friendly, and they used to have live jazz music.  It was a while ago I went.  Maybe too old of a crowd, not sure what age group you're looking for.",

Then if you guys like seafood, my big fat Greek restaurant near Dania is good too. There\u2019s also an Indian place nearby named Royal India.",

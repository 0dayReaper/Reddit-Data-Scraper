I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s like but it looks beautiful in pictures and looks like a very family oriented community. I\u2019ll be moving from Charlotte, North Carolina. I want to know if Plantation is a safe area, the crime rates, good parts, bad parts? Great private schools for children? Please help me with this and thank you:)",

A notification just went out yesterday that beginning August 21, 2023 all the kids will have to take clear backpacks and lunch boxes to public schools. The traffic in south Florida is generally terrible and you can\u2019t schedule appointments with your PCP in a reasonable time frame. The cost of buying and maintaining a home is outrageous. It\u2019s likely to just get worse the more populated it gets.",

The board members are full of people that want to abuse  what little power they get. It will feel like everyone in your neighborhood is always watching you being nosy and shit. You could have guest over one time and some loser will complain to the office about it. If you are a dog lover don't you dare have any other dog breed that isn't a teacup or pure breed golden retriever or goldendoodle, you will be treated like you have a wolf as a pet. \n\nMan, I could go on and on about all the fuckery that comes with living here. But another thing to keep in mind that the cities and neighborhoods are not separated by much land, you cold go two blocks and be in the City of Sunrise or you can wander in to Davie. So don't focus too much on the city. Its all being gentrified.",

But your friends may not be your neighbors. Many people just want to have their privacy and be left alone. If that's you, that's available. And Plantation is near to Fort Lauderdale, which is booming. Yes, that means traffic, but it also means great food, great entertainment, lots of jobs, a thriving economy, and if you want a break, the Keys are an hour away, so is Naples, you're 20 min from Miami, and you can be on the ocean in your own boat or floating on the Intracoastal in no time. \n\nIn the end, none of that will knock on your door except the isolation part. If you're the type that thinks \"this sucks\" and won't do anything about it, don't move here. We don't need another whiner. If you're good with finding what you need, it's all here.",

You will see a lot of residential areas and then rows of strip mall style plazas for restaurants and such.\n\nTraffic is relatively mild and the area is sedate. There does not seem to be any crime or bad parts. Florida is like a sandwich with good and bad parts as long, narrow rows going north/south. The bad parts are mostly near I-95. Even these places are not really bad at all.\n\nHowever, there is also no particular community or culture. It is your typical suburban vibe where everyone gets in their cars to go everywhere and you do not know your neighbors at all.\n\nAs for private schools there is one called Heritage. However, attending private school is immoral and if you send them there, you are a bad person =)",

Here's the reasoning.\n\nThe only reason to ever go to private school is to control the student population that your child is exposed to. The purpose of private school, explicitly, is segregation. They are there to keep out kids of the wrong sort. The absence of those kids is the exact reason why they are considered better. If you think about it for even one second anyone will realize that the teachers or whatever aren't better, its what they don't have to deal with.\n\nThe main moral issue is the segregation, bur private schools in general need to be destroyed because their existence prevents public schools from properly functioning. If public schools ever try to be equitable and to not give rich kids an advantage, those parents will bolt to private schools and burn the ground behind them.",

American heritage is super close, if not in plantation. I personally went to public middle (don\u2019t recommend) and st Thomas Aquinas for high school which was max 10 min drive and fantastic private catholic high school. I recommend you also look into Davie, Weston, and southwest ranches. As an adult I reside in Davie now &amp; I absolutely love it.

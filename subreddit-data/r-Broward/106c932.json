The disdain you have for people that simply don\u2019t want to live at the beach is honestly very interesting. I know many equestrian neighborhoods in Florida, and they certainly aren\u2019t poor and they certainly aren\u2019t anywhere near the beach. Likewise, my friends that have houses with their airplane parked out back in private runway are also nowhere near the beach. A lot of people have different hobbies, not just staring at the beach and eating at nice restaurants.",

No. A call to a commissioner, or police would, but this post has nothing of value, and I figured I contributed accordingly seeing as I only post when I'm on the toilet. Nobody really gives a shit where anyone lives, that's vanity, and you're right, I am old enough to know better but when I see an adult acting like a child, I make fun of it.",

And the 18 year old (Adderly) is quite bright, well prepared and would have been a breath of fresh air on the Board. Now that 4 Broward school board members have been named in the grand jury report, there is a very good chance they will be replaced by DeSantis appointments.  We can save one seat if you vote on November 8 for Alan Zeman, the candidate running against Donna Korn ( named in grand jury report).",

Next morning mailed it in.  Granted, I didn't have to spend that much time, but I would be a hypocrite if I just voted for whichever candidates name sounded better to me.",

Got something for voting by mail, got something where to show up, some people told me there is a thing like a voting cards. My voting invite, if I can say that arrived day after voting. Voting was on Tue... in a school, supposedly. Who makes voting on Tue at school. And the main thing i dont even remember getting some papers on what are we voting about and who are the options. Then when i tried to research on who is on the ballot I've seen too many options to even get into details who they are, if i was supposed to make smart choices in the first place. So every time for me voting looks like\nPerson A (republican)\nPerson B (democrat) \nPerson C (democrat)\n\nAnd it more feels like without special digging i don't even read the names just kinda looking for party. Not to mention i never figured out how to be able to vote for people in republican and democratic party at the same time for different things as both parties on regional level might have some good options. \n\nAnd i find myself tech savy, very educated person, who lived around the world. Cannot imagine how my next door Joe even processes the voting of any kind.",

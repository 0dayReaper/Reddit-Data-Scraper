                            "comment": "Where to start\u2026.the restaurant itself is absolutely disgusting. The back dining room (not show room) attached to the lanai area is infested with bugs. They\u2019re behind the wallpaper. The roof leaks. There are rats in the kitchen and feral cats that they keep around\u2026to kill the rats. They have a soft serve machine that NEVER got cleaned (supposed to be nightly). No one in the kitchen took the nozzles off the soda machines to clean them. All of the ice in the restaurant comes from a machine\u2026in the cigarette break room. That same \u201croom\u201d is attached to the kitchen and only separated by rubber flaps, not even a real door\u2026and it has or used to have a fridge that housed all of the restaurant\u2019s chicken. If you ever ate there and thought your honey chicken tasted like cigarettes, it\u2019s because it did. In the big walk in, it wasn\u2019t abnormal for melted ice cream or milk products to be sitting on top of defrosting meat. Most of the drinks on their menu are pre-mixed and sit for days in jugs. Servers and room captains *always* drank from the Mai tais and rum barrels before bringing them out to the guests. In terms of the wait staff, cocaine is a huge problem there, like most restaurants. *everyone* is racist. The seating/front desk staff and room captains had a word for black families that was explained to me as the Polynesian version of the N word. If you were a darker skinned individual eating at the Mai kai, your ticket said you were a \u201cpopolo\u201d or a \u201cpopo\u201d. I know of two people working there who were subsequently arrested for pedophilia. One busboy (who also regularly worked the kid show on Sunday mornings) and a room captain. The catering manager was known for putting his hand down the server\u2019s pants. The owner Mr Levi was notorious for exposing himself to young women while working. The girls who worked in the bar had to weigh in once a week before clocking in. The restaurant itself was struggling financially for years. They used to use a tiny bank in Oakland park and were constantly overdrawn, to the point where the bank wouldn\u2019t allow staff to cash their checks. To this day they still owe me thousands. It was also in complete disarray. The roof in the main dining area (near the stage) was being held together by literal staple guns and trash bags). Ever wonder why it\u2019s so dark in there and the waiters have to carry flashlights? It\u2019s to hide the holes in the ceiling.\n\nI could go on and on, but I don\u2019t want to identify myself lol",

As a follow up to yesterday's post about feedback to the MPO (Metropolitan Planning Organization) here's the link to a survey about transportation:  \n[https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/5671507fb303428b97d27c025693f3ec](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/5671507fb303428b97d27c025693f3ec)\n\nOnly 7 questions and you can win a $250 gift card, and help to improve our county.\n\nThey are gathering feedback to develop a new transportation plan for the county. Hopefully this feedback will help to make decisions to improve public transit, our dangerous roadways, and multimodal safety.

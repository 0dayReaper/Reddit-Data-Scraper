    "postText": "Given the recent political landscape, my spouse and I are leaning towards leaving FL for good. Things only seem to be getting worse and with huge political decisions being pushed through quietly we feel like there's no longer any hope in things improving democratically. We always vote but is there more we should be doing? \n\nIs there hope of things getting better here? We have our family, friends, job, house, and pets here and it would be very hard to leave it all but we're at our last straw. We're both ~30yo engineers so we handle the hit financially, but it's still a hard choice to uproot our whole lives since we grew up here. \n\nFeeling very torn and greatly appreciate any input, suggestions, and opinions. Thank you",

And many people just want to be home when not working. This is anecdotal of course, but I think it\u2019s generally true of American culture. \n\nI\u2019ve also been trying to get involved with the county to try and change our transportation system and infrastructure, but I\u2019m learning that this is a decades long endeavor.",

Density is worse and traffic too. All considerations for us in leaving the state together. No one has mentioned the climate situation which, in my opinion, is reason enough to seek higher ground. I like the comments that we should stay and fight for the Florida we want. But you have to be able to pay the bills. Also, it sure is comfortable to live among like-minded people, if you can find them. I forgot to mention they are planning to expand their family and the abortion laws here make that a much riskier decision.",

What I have issue with is things like carving up the congressional districts, funding differences of over 11x in campaigns, padding our SC, and passing laws in the dead of night that go very against majority citizen support. Those are the things that make it feel no longer volatile and start to feel like a hopeless battle. I'd be pissed regardless of which side did that.",

My close family have been here for decades and they don't have the means to leave but they've thought about it.\n\nPart of me wants to go, but part of me wants to stay and try to make it better. If you want to stay, I think volunteering is the next step, forming community and continuing to organize together to form a voting bloc that can't be ignored. Even consider running for local or state office. The way I see it, there are so many unqualified individuals throughout our state making decisions that don't serve the community. There are also some career politicians who need to hear new perspectives and voices. Maybe it's worth a shot if this is something you're really passionate about.\n\nIf you want to move on and live on elsewhere that is ok too. There are challenges with both options but if it helps you to be happier and have a better quality of life it makes sense. I think there is still hope if we can help each other and continue pushing against these changes. Hope you all can stay!",

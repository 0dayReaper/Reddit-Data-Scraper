Did he refuse to let more qualified companies distribute?  Is Publix even making money off of it?   What time lapsed between the donation and the selection of Publix to distribute?  I'm all for calling out crooked politicians, but i won't condemn then on innuendo and supposition.  If someone wants to investigate they should go for it.  Then report regardless of the outcome.",

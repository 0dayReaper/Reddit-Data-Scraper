Kazhdan is only one of the many businessmen that engage in international trade, and the volume of his transactions is minuscule comparing to the total volume. I think it was WSJ that had an article just a few weeks ago about &gt;80% of parts in Russian drones are manufactured in the US. \n\nNo one is interested in going after military industrial complex. Punishing the middleman is purely for the optics like something is being done.",

Both sides seem like they have no clue what is happening.  \n\nNext Wednesday is when he should be pleading for the actual massacre, unless the defense gets their continuance, which looked unlikely since the judge was not happy they asked for one after she had already set aside like 3 weeks next month for jury selection.",

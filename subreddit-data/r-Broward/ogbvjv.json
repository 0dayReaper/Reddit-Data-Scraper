            "comment": "&gt; ***Six major sewer main failures in three weeks have dumped 126.9 million gallons of raw sewage into the City of Fort Lauderdale\u2019s neighborhoods and waterways.   Fort Lauderdale\u2019s sewage crisis is the result of past and present City leaders failing to recognize the importance of a maintained wastewater infrastructure. As the City grows and wastewater infrastructure ages, City leaders are failing to make timely, sufficient investments in wastewater infrastructure repairs and improvements. In fact, they repeatedly reallocate taxpayer money intended for the City\u2019s water and sewer operation to the City\u2019s operating budget.   Understanding that increased volumes of wastewater will put even more pressure on the City\u2019s corroding pipes and strained treatment facilities, the City Commission has made slow-growth promises; yet the Commission continues to approve the building of high-rises condos and hotels.***     \n  \nhttps://awsproject.org/awsp-press-release-on-fort-lauderdale-sewage-spills/   \n   \n*****    \n   \nHow should Fort Lauderdale respond?  \n   \nA) Stop further development until well after all infrastructure is properly maintained and resized to handle it  \n  \nB) Cut back on unnecessary expenses to fund infrastructure repairs  \n   \nC) Expand infrastructure to handle not only existing and projected demand, but also flooding risks from hurricane impacts and climate change   \n   \nD) Answers A, B and C combined, or...   \n   \nE) Fuck it, let's just give developers a green light and waste loads of the city's scarce funds on expensive new flooding-prone tunnels!",

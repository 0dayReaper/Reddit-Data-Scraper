From there it would be adjusted annually according to the consumer price index. \n\nAmendment 3 does away with political party primaries for governor, Cabinet and the Legislature. It replaces them with primary elections open to every candidate and to every voter, regardless of party. The top two winners in each race would face off in the general election. That allows many more people to have their say in who governs Florida.",

Companies will have to cut down on employees, and the idea of automation won't seem to bad. Why pay for 10 cashiers, when you can have two employees man the 10 self checkout lanes. This is a slower burn so then companies aren't too drastic with changes due to the rising expenses.\n\nWhat we should be looking at is more affordable housing, you shouldn't have to be 55 years of age to get a decent deal on a rental.",

Why can't Walmart be a business that just needs 20 people being paid a \"fair wage\". We can't force businesses to have a set number of employees, if they can just do away with a large portion of them and make everything else automatic. They find the extra money by cutting the highest expense, jobs. \n\nNow a blanket statement that all businesses have to pay this amount to their employees, put small businesses in a disadvantage. They can't afford to automate, and if they need the employees to be there, they better be raking in enough money to support everybody. If we slowly raise the minimum wage, and drop the cost of living, then we'll reach an equilibrium",

I know, I'll have the government force my job to pay me more by raising the minimum wage, THEN I'll be able to afford it. What's this? The price of the cheeseburger went up too? Crap, I still can't afford a cheeseburger at McDonald's. Maybe I should have the government raise the minimum wage again. That worked the last time. \ud83d\ude44\n\nEdit: I lived in Denver from 2017 to 2019. While I was there, the minimum wage was $11.10 an hour. Now, that's better than Florida, so you'd assume everything was better there... but the opposite was true. Price of living there is MUCH higher than Miami. Our job's starting pay was $17 an hour, and it was considered shit pay because $17 an hour was barely livable there. Raising minimum wage to $15 an hour would only make it worse. $15 an hour is only good pay when it's ***not*** the minimum wage. Once that becomes the bottom line, everything only goes UP from there. I'm not joking when I say that the cost of a cheeseburger will go up, as will the cost of rent. If I know you're bringing home an extra $14,560 a year in income, I can raise my rent by $500 per month, and you'll be able to easily afford it. And if you can't, someone else can.\n\nA 715 square foot apartment in Denver was $1,640 per month. This wasn't in an expensive side of town, and was considered cheap. I was looking to move closer to my job, and there were 500sqft apartments over $1,850 per month.\n\nSo go ahead, vote yes on Amendment 2. If it passes, and your rent skyrockets, I want you to come back to this post and say \"ToddTheOdd, you were right, and I was wrong.\"",

And yes, I haven't struggled in awhile, but I certainly struggled.  I've seen both sides.  Which is why I have a well rounded opinion, instead of an emotionally charged childish outlook. I'm absolutely unapologetic about it.  I stand by my quote above.  That's the outlook I, myself had, and what helped me get out of poverty.\n\nI didn't say Broward was low cost of living.  I even said local areas can drive up wages if they want.  But that it's bad for the State to do.\n\nAs an employer now, I am well aware of how wages work in that range.  You can't hire someone for less than $12/hr nowadays in Broward as it is.  And even then, they won't still around.  The market drives up wages naturally, and that natural progression keeps a healthy market.\n\nWhen you start legislating massive wage increases and mess with the market, you end up with Detroit.  Drive the wages up beyond market conditions, and drive the businesses right out of town, leaving a criminal infested shit hole in its place.\n\nAnd again, cost of living is driven up by people who CAN afford it.

If you want to help those in need in Broward, then that's what we need to do, not vote to jack wages up and crush the economy of Palatka.\n\nWe do have programs, like Save Our Homes, to help keep people from being priced out of areas with increasing cost of living.  But this is not a new concept and it's not going to change.  If you don't keep up, then that's on you, luckily it's as simple as looking for an opportunity elsewhere.  It's a big State, even bigger country.  That's how life has always worked.  We have very nice areas in Florida where you can buy a 2 bedroom single family home for $100k.

Also a high deductible will help. \n\nCondo insurance is also rapidly going up so expect HOA fees to increase next year. With a condo the hoa policy covers the outside but you still need a policy that covers inside the dwelling. \n\nSupposedly the state is passing new insurance laws. Hopefully it\u2019s not a half ass bandaid fix.",

Very boring town. \n\nCincy otoh has gorgeous hills and parks, the river, the best zoo east of the Mississippi, and a killer food scene by any Midwestern standards. It\u2019s eastern time, just barely - and it\u2019s nice to be on NY\u2019s time zone. You\u2019ve got kentucky right across the river and Indiana 20 minutes away. It also gets less than a foot of snow on average and is a degree or two warmer on any given day \u2014 compared to Columbus checking in at over 3 feet. Being farther from the lake is crucial in keeping a saner winter climate. If we get 3 inches of snow, that\u2019s a lot. Columbus would be at one foot, easy. \n\nAsheville is 5 hours away, Chicago is 5 hours away, Indy is 2 hours away, Michigan is 4 hours away. You can make Atlanta or DC in 7 if the traffic is good \u2014 if you leave at dawn you can be in Disney/central FL for dinner.

There\u2019s another fish market on 17th. But really, in Broward, Dade and Monroe counties, there is no shortage of high grade fish of all types, you\u2019re asking to be spoon fed our biggest domestic product. It\u2019s everywhere. Whole Foods used to have great Ahi but the past few years I haven\u2019t been impressed. Try Winn-Dixie. And yes, I know what I\u2019m talking about, I started fucking around on charters and long liners as a pre-teen, family business.",

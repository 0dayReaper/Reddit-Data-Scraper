The judge asked why are we here. I called the DA who assisted me but the girl got let go bc she has kids. Maybe a welfare check would have been in order. I should had said I'm a unicorn. Maybe, that would have got the brain dead waste of a woman some kind of awakening to do her job. They throw a cape on these buffoons and they ruin families lives, give records, and the criminals skip off. Knowing her sister in the mock could careless. Another example a rapist let go and worse he was wearing a cape and still Noone questioned the truth just let IT go to judge others.a rapist giving out sentences yayy broward\nFuck you I wish I had enough money to move from this place.  Hire someone who thinks Ata 2nd grade level and we would be safer.",

Although there\u2019s lots of talk in the news of big corporations and private equity funds buying American single family homes, it\u2019s way overblown. I agree that corporate ownership of entire neighborhoods with the intention of keeping people as perpetual renters is bad for society and should potentially be stopped, but, again, it\u2019s currently an extremely small minority of all home purchases in America. You probably learned this from the major news media, which likes to scare you.\n\nBase your comments on fact, not speculation or hype:\n\nhttps://marker.medium.com/private-equity-is-buying-your-block-with-your-neighbors-money-8d37e98ebc2d",

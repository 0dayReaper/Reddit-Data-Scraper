You can get away with skating on the sidewalks on weekdays where only pedestrian traffic belongs, but no matter what cheery music you play, you're a nuisance to those around you.",

There are plenty of places to avoid traffic and not endanger those around him to push YouTube videos that light up the AdBlocker like a Christmas tree.",

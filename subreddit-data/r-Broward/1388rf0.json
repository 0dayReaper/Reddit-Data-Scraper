If you've ever noticed a flash at an intersection, it's a red light camera and should have a sign posted.\n\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-taAeiWQLITg/UFs6Yt5qhEI/AAAAAAAAMcg/AbgAG5HneZc/s543/red+light+camera+or+traffic+camera.png\n\nhttps://www.sunrisefl.gov/residents/red-light-safety-cameras",

The real red light cameras are usually set back from an intersection, so they can get a picture of your license plate.\n\nSince red light cameras have been [ruled as illegal](https://www.lb-law.com/car-accident/red-light-cameras-florida/) (in Florida), most Broward municipalities have disabled them.\n\nThere are, however, four cities that are still using them. ~~Pembroke Pines~~, Sunrise, Tamarac, Davie, and West Park.",

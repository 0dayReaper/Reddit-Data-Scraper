Conversely, a physically small and otherwise limited government, such as in the U.S. Antebellum South, might egregiously violate individual rights by embracing and enforcing slavery\n\nIn other words, what DeSantis did is spot on Small Government political philosophy.  He used his power to remove \"big government\" local politicians power and limit their ability to restrict constituents of the State in which he governs.  \n\n\nMind you, this wasn't simply an EO.  This was legislation passed through the State legislature, which does include our local elected representatives.",

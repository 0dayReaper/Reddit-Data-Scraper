    "postText": "I live in an efficiency with no kitchen, just a fridge and microwave. I usually buy food on Uber eats and pick it up, but all the prices are rising. Wondering if anyone knows of any food subscription service? I live in Davie. Preferably not like the ones you store in a fridge and microwave. When i lived in miami there was a food sub service which would deliver lunches and it ended up being like 5$ per lunch.",

Cheaper, cast iron topped hotplates work too, but they take a lot longer to heat up. \n\nWalmart has a set of stainless steel cookware (that will last forever) for less than $25. https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mainstays-Stainless-Steel-10-Piece-Kitchen-Set/50660024\n\nGo around to different Goodwills for plates, bowls and flatware. \n\nSeconding /u/sendcreampies on getting a crock pot. That's another thing you can pick up at goodwill. I'd also recommend an electric kettle for ramen and a rice cooker.",

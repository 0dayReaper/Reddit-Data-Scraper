    "postText": "I have lived all over the USA. I have noticed a problem in south Florida where drivers are loathe to stop at stop signs or even red lights. It's not one specific group either. It's almost everyone. If I come to a four way stop and fully stop before going, the people behind me act very offended and usually blow through the stop sign, hot on my tail. Or, lord help me, if I go through a four way stop and the person on the cross-traffic has to stop at the stop sign to avoid hitting me, they will again act very offended. Anyone know why this is? I have only experienced this in south Florida.",

            "comment": "I am glad you brought this up. I\u2019m sure you are an awesome person first off. I\u2019m just speaking on why this is, there\u2019s a few factors at play here. I hope I don\u2019t wax on too long. Let me try and keep it short.\n\nI grew up in a town where if you don\u2019t stop at a stop sign you will get ticketed immediately. It will be expensive, and if discovered to be young and brown perhaps car searched as well. This town would also pull you over if you had a cracked tail light, again, as a teen I would be pulled out of car and vehicle searched as well. It does something to you. \n\nOne day, I realized I wanted to go somewhere where the petty bullshit is not penalized. I would often visit family down here and came to realize, the police here are very very hands off. If you are going out of your way to commit crime, the cops will be there. BCSO is great. Very professional. But they are also busy. With real crime. So the rolling through stop signs, they are not pursuing it. And soon, this becomes culture. \n\nWhy? Well that\u2019s simple, it\u2019s lame to come to a full stop at a stop sign if it is as clear as day there is nobody there. It adds time to your trip, it wears brakes more, uses more gas, I don\u2019t make the rules but this is physics. \n\nWe have a mindset that we are all pirates, being in such a tropic landscape, it\u2019s expensive to live here, you really have to be a go getter and out for yours kind of person to be a homeowner. These  kinds of people got places to be. And they want to get there with no unnecessary stops. They know the cops aren\u2019t coming. And we aren\u2019t that religious here either so if nobody is at the stop sign, it\u2019s just between you and god at that point\u2026 and as I said, sofla isn\u2019t known for it being a pious place. I hope you are picking up what I\u2019m putting down here. I want a new paragraph but all of a sudden my phone won\u2019t let me, but my last thing I wanted to add, I moved here explicitly because I wanted less police intervention in my life as a young man, and that\u2019s exactly what I got when I came here. It\u2019s been incredible. I thank for every day the cops here aren\u2019t corny and let ppl come and go as they please. BUT one side effect of that is\u2026 ppl aren\u2019t stoping at stop signs if they don\u2019t have to.",

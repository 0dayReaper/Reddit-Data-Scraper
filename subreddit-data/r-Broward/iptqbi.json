Im think im gonna help him out this week cause its short notice but moving forward id like to know what working parents do to mitigate this situation. I'd like to refer him to whatever resources yall can refer me to. \n\nthe way he describes it is that the 5 year old needs constant help with physical aspects and virtual aspects so theres no distant slacking",

Our son started kindergarten and I basically sit next to him the whole time making sure he is focusing (luckily I was already staying at home with him and wasn't planning to go back to work yet). I noticed some of the other kids are usually left on their own with the parent or an older sibling checking in once in a while but you can see that they get distracted easily and the teacher can't really do much but just call their name and hope they listen.",

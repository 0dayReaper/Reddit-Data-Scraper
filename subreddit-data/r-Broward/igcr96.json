    "postText": "I\u2019ll try to keep this short. I moved here from VA in the beginning of august. I have been trying to make an appointment with any DMV in Broward since the beginning of august. My registration expires at the end of august. I need my Florida license to get my car registered in Florida. The DMV always gives me a busy signal and the website is constantly booked for appointments. I stayed up until midnight thinking it would renew and I could get a slot but it didn\u2019t, It was all booked. I have no idea what to do. Help. Please. Also, I contacted collier county and they said that I have to get it in my own county because of covid.",

I know this isn't much help but just wanted to let you know that there isn't much you can do and that you're not doing anything wrong. Hang in there.",

But just keep checking exactly at midnight, hopefully you\u2019ll get it. Don\u2019t do it at Saturday 12 AM or Sunday 12 AM though since most places don\u2019t operate on the weekends",

I got lucky and managed to snag an appointment a week ago when they started scheduling farther than 2 weeks out. \n\nBut here is the important part, the one time I managed to talk to someone on the phone line, I found out you do NOT need a Florida Driver's License to Register your car and get plates. You just need a valid driver's license from any state. \n\nHence why I now have Florida plates on my car but no drivers license yet. Be aware, if this is your first time getting plates in Florida, it will cost about $450.",

Depending on where you live, you may be only 20 or 30 mins away from it even if they are in a different county.\n\nMy experience, all the broward county DMVs were full and I went to check and had luck with the one at the turnpike and Rt 27 (just north of Doral).  Good luck.",

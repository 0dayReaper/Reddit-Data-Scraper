My guess is it would be somewhere in the millions of dollars. Let\u2019s just scrap the name change idea and use that money for something more worth while, like bettering our Public Schools and helping out our lower income communities.",

I think coming to terms with that doesn't necessarily mean attempting to sanitize the history. \n\nDon't get wrong, tear down all the confederate statues. Those aren't real history, majority have been put in the last 50 years.

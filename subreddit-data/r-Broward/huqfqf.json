Stop for gas - more people at risk.  Pick up groceries - those employees are at risk too.  Are those jobs less important than teaching children?  Why are teachers special?  And don't forget that there are consequences to keeping kids at home too, for parents who can't work, and kids who will fall behind in less than enriching environments.",

That\u2019s the logical way to approach it.  Focus on helping in this effort if you can.  If not, focus on helping in another way.  We all need to help each other out as much as possible right now.  Even small gestures go a long way to express that we care.  I care about the restaurant workers, the gas station workers, the grocery store workers and wear a mask and social distance.  Putting teachers and students together in tight quarters for extensive periods of time is a disaster waiting to happen.  There are definitely drawbacks to kids staying out of school, but the drawbacks of starting back to school how are so so much worse.",

I don't know if or how it'll be different, but this whole thing will blow up in everyone's face soon. Spending a lot of time around someone, hours and hours worth, it won't matter if you're wearing a mask at that point. That, and kids are never going to be as clean as they need to be. They're germ factories. So are many adults. \n\nI tried expressing my opinion to her about this, but whatever I say doesn't really sink in. She KNOWS the issues, she understands, but I don't know what to say to her. I don't feel like I can ask her to not work there after all the interviews she had to get this job, but I have asked her once anyway. She's going, and I know both of us are going to get sick because of it.",

I mean even the custodians are getting sick and transmitting it, it\u2019s so contagious.  I think it\u2019s political theatre and it will be called off at the last minute.  It\u2019s a shame to put this situation on our teachers with no support, plan or resources.  Our state and federal \u201cleadership\u201d continuing to flounder at the cost of people\u2019s lives.  The negative outcome of keeping kids out of school is no comparison to the train wreck of kids, families, teachers and custodians and administrators getting sick.  We shouldn\u2019t have ever arrived at this horrible cross roads and pushing through to keep the train going further off the rails is no way to proceed.  We have to collectively pushback, for everyone\u2019s sake.  Thanks for posting!",

Contact your local commissioner, governor, school board and suggest options for disadvantaged children as opposed to sacrificing teachers, faculty, and students needlessly. Really there should have been a plan in place for this months ago, but here we are. And besides, if one child or faculty tests positive, the whole school gets shut down and we\u2019re back to e-learning, so why open in the first place and risk lives?",

They aren't driving their kids for meals.  They are leaving the house and kids unsupervised.  You clearly come from a happy home and have absolutely no idea how things work in disadvantaged communities.  I dated a title 9 teacher for years.  It's shocking.  Starving kids, no baths, poor hygiene, heck, the parents barely go their kids to school when they were open.  These communities and children rely on schools far more than you can ever imagine.  It's reckless to close schools.",

                    "comment": "&gt; Closed schools affect the most at risk children by far.\n\nI completely agree and there is [a great UNESCO article outlining the dangers of school closures which I think is very relevant for USA as well](https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse/consequences). Its better for everyone if schools are open, and teachers and parents *want* schools open.\n\nHowever, reopening needs to be carefully planned in order to best protect those kids as well as teachers, faculty, and the families of the aforementioned. UNESCO, the same entity to publish the consequences of reopening, also conveniently provided [a framework for reopening](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000373348Z) which requires precautions such as:\n\n* clear national guidance on parameters for decision making on school openings\n* Increase the share of schools with safe water, handwashing stations, cleaning supplies\n* Train administrative staff and teachers on implementing physical distancing\n* Policies should protect staff, teachers and students who are at high risk due to age or underlying medical conditions, with plans to cover absent teachers and continue remote education\n\n..etc. None of these things have been covered in Florida yet, and if we proceeded with the reopening on time, it would be a mere two weeks from now that kids are back in school, when meanwhile, FL is reporting 10k/day COVID19 cases for 5 days in a row. \n\nI assume you are not a teacher nor related to one, because while I want the best for at-risk children, I am not willing to sacrifice teachers and their families for it. This should not be a zero-sum game, and teachers are scared, picketing, protesting, and suing because the pressure to reopen prematurely is coming down without proper time, guidance and funding to ensure everyone's safety.",

Which is why I am so adamant about getting the schools open.  These kids were the sweetest things, but their parents utter disasters.  I volunteered a few times. They NEED the supervision, meals, etc.  Badly.  People don't realize just how bad these areas are, how difficult it is for these kids, and just how absolutely critical is for them to be in school.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I don't support recklessly opening.  But this needs to be mission critical to figure out immediately.\n\nAt the same time, I have relatives in Europe and their kids were back to school months ago.  They managed just fine.

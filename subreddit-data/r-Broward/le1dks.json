    "postText": "Hey, just a quick post here if you are trying to buy a house in Broward now. I am a local realtor and the market is super competitive. \n\nIt seems as if every house that comes on the market, there are 50 other buyers interested as well. Don't be too hard on the Realtor...it is just the market we are in now. Every buyer is going through the same thing - sending many offers, only to have them rejected. Stick with it and move fast on properties that you like. Know your \"must have\" criteria different from \"optional\" criteria, so you can be decisive.\n\nMy advice if you are planning to by a home in Broward anytime soon is to give yourself a longer time period for the search process and understand the market we are in so your expectations are in line.\n\nGood Luck!",

After we sourced the property and  fixed it up, one of our regular buyers was a hedge fund...and they would overpay in some instances. I think it is also compounded now because many buyers were not able to buy last year and they are also in the market.",

I couldn't even get in the door to look at a property after it had been listed 2 days prior, as they had already accepted an offer.\n  \nCondos/Townhomes aren't as crazy, but its rough.   I'm in the market now, and patience really is going to have to be the key.\n  \nHere's my question(s) for ya:  Since prices are going for above appraisal, it seems it makes even coming with an offer backed by a mortgage will be difficult (lender wont approve if its too much above appraisal).   Are we due for a correction anytime soon?   How much?   If you're not in a rush, is it better to wait, or get in now?   \"When\" do we expect interest rates to go back up?  Are we expecting any kind of \"uptick/surge\" in inventory anytime soon?\n  \nI'm looking to move before the new school year (so august), so I'm wondering if this is a hopeless endeavor for a regular buyer, and I just need to wait a year, or if things will change in the near(ish) future?\n\nEdit: Realtor I'm working with expects prices to continue to increase over the next 6 months (5% ish), and that interest rates will probably go up at that point.  Beyond that, not expecting any kind of large correction like 2009, but there may be a dip, just not one big enough to wait for.",

I am seeing sellers asking for buyers to put up additional cash to make up the difference between appraisal and asking price. I am actually working a deal now where the buyer had to do this. So if you don't have that extra cash lying around, it is going to be tough.\n\nI agree with your realtors assessment....I don't think we will see a slowdown right now because I feel many people who wanted to buy last year had to put it off because of the pandemic and they are now just getting back into the market. \n\nI think the earlier you can start the better. Encourage your realtor to send back up offers and follow up, as a lot of these deals fall through and the sellers get desperate.",

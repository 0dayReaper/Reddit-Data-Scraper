When in Rome I suppose.  This place has been like this for a hot min.  Traffic would not be as bad if everyone just learned 2 basic traffic functions.\n\n1.  Proper use of left lane\n2.  Proper way to merge.\n\nIt goes without saying cell phone use is probably up there too.",

I've only been here since 2010, but I feel like it wasn't always like this. Is it getting worse or has it always been this bad?",

The reason is that people will drive at the speed they feel comfortable. The wider a road is, the faster you will tend to go. There's little difference between the width of a highway lane and a typical lane on University drive or 441. \n\nThere are many examples, but it's pretty obvious that most roads in Broward want to move cars at high speeds.\n\nEdit: Changed road to lane. Was trying to compare lane width.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m looking for an landscaper in Hollywood. The wife and I bought a house in Hollywood a few years ago that had an addition built a few years before we bought it. It looks like the contractors dug out an area or the foundation and piled up the dirt in the backyard. This is causing a large hump in the middle of the yard that causes water to be funneled water towards the house.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear recommendations from anybody who knows a landscaper who can handle this.",

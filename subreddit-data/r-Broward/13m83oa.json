I make the trip from palm to A1A on Sheridan every Sunday morning and going about 65 I can make it almost the whole way in one go. Maybe a stop at 441 or 95 but that\u2019s about it. Palm and later Nob hill is actually one of my favorite cruises to go north/south as long as it\u2019s not rush hour. Only 2 lanes for most of it but it\u2019s just long, sprawled, gorgeous curvy roads for miles on end. Much much much more pleasant of a drive with much much faster moving traffic than university and a bunch of the other irritatingly slow streets.",

The segment from Lyons Road right before the main entrance to Broward College/North Campus is aggravating.\nI call it the Panama Canal because you hit every light. It's annoying when you have the high school students from Coconut Creek High School clowning around the street and on top of that; there is always some sort of road work being performed around the Wynmoor Retirement Complex. It doesn't help when you have people that live there are still allowed to drive.",

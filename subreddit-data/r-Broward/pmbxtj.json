It could be 6 miles in one direction and 6 miles coming back or the whole 13.1 in one way.",

You can do 2.5ish loops there. \n\n\nI think the loop at Markham Park is 7 miles (I ran a race there once, but it was on the levee).\n\n\nIn Boca raton, there's a park behind the Spanish River Library. I forgot how long the loop is (maybe 2 miles), but it's a beautiful area to run. With you doing loops, you could set up your own aid station so you won't have to carry your own water supply.",

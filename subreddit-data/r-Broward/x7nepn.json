When this happened to me, BSO would not come out to my house nor were they interested in being sent my video. They claimed it was because the contents of my package was minimal. Keep in mind that BSO has the software, but they only seem to use it on peaceful protestors:\n\nhttps://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-ne-facial-recognition-protests-20210626-7sll5uuaqfbeba32rndlv3xwxi-htmlstory.html\n\n(2) Start doing patrols in targeted neighborhoods. I can count on one hand the number of times I've seen patrols in my neighborhood (and my cameras catch all cars driving by). Yet, I constantly observe BSO officers hanging out and leisurely having conversations with other officers for hours at a time in shopping center or office building parking lots. I highly doubt that BSO has any requirements for their officers to continually patrol.\n\n(3) Set up a sting operations like this:\n\nhttps://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/east-bay/alleged-milpitas-package-thief-arrested-minutes-after-police-set-up-bait-operation/2199362/",

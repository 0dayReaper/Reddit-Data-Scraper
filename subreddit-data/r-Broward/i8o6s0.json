    "postText": "Hi there, I\u2019m Krysttian and I developed [Drivefine.com](http://drivefine.com/) a free service (no payment information required) that subscribes users to monthly automated driver license reports delivered via SMS.\n\nThe service is free and requires no credit card information. As stated in the FAQ below, the data is gathered from the Broward County Clerks Driver license check service you can access directly [here](https://www.browardclerk.org/Clerkwebsite/BCCOC2/Pubsearch/dl_search.aspx).\n\nTo sign up please navigate to [www.drivefine.com](http://www.drivefine.com/), at the bottom there is a subscribe form to fill out.\n\nThank you for your time, I hope you find the service useful and any feedback is greatly appreciated!\n\nFAQ:\n\nHow are the reports generated:\n\nThe reports are run monthly currently using the Broward County Clerk of court service, but should report relevant suspensions sent to the flhsmv regardless of the county. Please note you\u2019ll want to contact the county and flhsmv for a full picture of your driver license status.\n\nHow much does it cost:\n\nThe service intends to stay free, requiring no payment information from subscribers, and is actively searching for sponsorship to encourage sustainability.\n\nHow is my data protected:\n\nDriver license numbers are Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and we take steps to protect this data as such. Communication to the server is encrypted both from you to application, and from the application to the database. We also encrypt the database at rest.\n\nHow did the project get started, and what are the technical details:\n\nSee my presentation for more information about the service [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Bj5qJzmMRG-XO8eE79a5v3Jf2RnhDTR0OkTjlH4_L-U/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nIs the codebase open source:\n\nThe software is free and open source: [https://github.com/krysttian/ftw](https://github.com/krysttian/ftw)\n\nWhat kind of guarantee do you offer:\n\nNone, please see our license: [https://github.com/krysttian/ftw/blob/master/LICENSE](https://github.com/krysttian/ftw/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\nHow can I contact you:\n\nFeel free to email us at [support@drivefine.com](mailto:support@drivefine.com) if you have comments, suggestions, or concerns. You can also follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/drivefine/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drivefine), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/drivefine/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DriveFineFlorida/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do I signup:\n\nGo to [www.drivefine.com](https://www.drivefine.com) and fill out the form on the home page.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDZFd9TbCF",

While its certainly possible that Broward Clerk of Courts is using their driver license check system to determine who to issue jury summons, it seems unlikely in my humble opinion. If I get the chance to speak to someone at the clerk of courts i'll be sure to bring it up!",

On the roadmap is to integrate with as many county clerk of courts to get the best information quickly.",

I didn\u2019t even know until I came back to Florida and opened my mail.  I would have gotten a Washington drivers license to avoid the hell that not having a drivers license made getting Florida car insurance (in order to get drivers license back needed proof of insurance).  Another awful sunshine tax.  Good thing I didn\u2019t get into an accident while license was suspended without even knowing.",

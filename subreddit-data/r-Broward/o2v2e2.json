There's the Swap Shop on Sunrise Blvd, too, but that's a little chaotic. If you're into cars, there are tons of car shows in South Florida - some in Broward. Worth a look [here](https://flacarshows.com/events/category/southeast-florida/).  [Fort Lauderdale on the Cheap](https://fortlauderdaleonthecheap.com/festivals-in-broward-some-free/) has a few interesting things coming up to look at. [ArtsPark at Young Circle](https://www.hollywoodfl.org/65/ArtsPark-at-Young-Circle) usually has something intereseting going on. [FATVillage (Flagler Village)](https://www.fatvillage.com/artwalk) has an artwalk the last Saturday of every month. [Sunny.org](https://Sunny.org) is also a good resource to find things to do. I hope you find something to get un-bored.",

            "comment": "\"New times magazine\" print or online for Broward has ongoing schedules for events of all types and areas\n\nWilling to sweat? If you have a bicycle/skates, look into critical mass rides (last Friday of every month) and \"slow rides\". You can even do them on a rented bike. Miami bike scene .com Covers the tri-county area and more\n\nThe first will introduce you to the cycling and bike-curious crowd and tell you which slow rides are happening or under the radar. \n\nSlow rides usually have a stop to eat and drink and really are slow enough for most folks and kids. Lots of bar/restaurant workers do these rides. Some are even organized by bars and restaurants so you get later happy hour deals on food and drink. \n\nRather not sweat? Keep checking art and science museum schedules. Nova university has modern art exhibits in a big downtown space. Last week it sounded like they were back. FAT village-Ftl, Wynwood-Miami and other hipster downtowns will have an \"Art walk\" some time in the month. The galleries stay open late for the public and there are artisanal pop up shops or food vendors.",

I know some libraries have certain equipment to rent out that could be something you\u2019d enjoy. Broward is pretty big but there\u2019s all sorts of parks with different activities- for instance for $15 at Walmart you can get a set discs for disc golf. I\u2019ve always enjoyed the beach, just bring the sunblock. Start exercising like crazy, reading like crazy, trying to make plans with your friends like crazy.",

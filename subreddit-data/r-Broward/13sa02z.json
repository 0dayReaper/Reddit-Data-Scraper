I did it for a while when I got laid off. I really just needed a wetsuit, fins and a mask. They provided the tanks and regulators. I will say, I already own a duplex, have a decent car, had an emergency fund and we switched to the insurance offered by my wife\u2019s job.\n\nIt isn\u2019t for everybody, but if you just need to pay some bills for a little bit, it beats retail or fast food in my opinion.\n\nAnd since we don\u2019t know OP\u2019s situation, they could be living at home with parents or family for free I threw it out there.",

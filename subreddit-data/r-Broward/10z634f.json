    "postText": "This is exactly the type of behavior that is going on within BSO in our communities.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/us/tyre-nichols-photo-memphis-demetrius-haley.html\n\nIt\u2019s illogical to me that our cities willingly allocate the majority of our cities\u2019 budgets to this organization without requiring any accountability, transparency and/or checks and balances. \n\nFor example, why does BSO handle complaints against them with *their* internal affairs team? \n\nThat, to me, is completely illogical. \n\nWhy do we not know how much crime has been reduced YoY, or what the results of paying them $53 million per year is actually doing for our citizens? \n\nI don\u2019t care how many events they monitored last year. That\u2019s a vanity metric. I want to know what positive results that $53 million got us last year.\n\nAlso, why do we humiliate and shame people who have been [falsely] arrested by a [possibly corrupt] cop(s) by plastering their \u201coffense\u201d all over the internet, which can prevent them from getting a job, yet there is no similar database for bad cops or cops with numerous complaints filed against them? \n\nAgain, that is illogical to me. \n\nWhy are these people considered God when it\u2019s proven over and over again these people don\u2019t have the grace or capability to not abuse their power?\n\nGoogle \u201chow hard is it to become a BSO,\u201d and you\u2019ll see on Google, it says:\n\n1. No experience required. Must be 18 years or older.\n\nThis is horrifying to me. \n\nThere should be public reports about the backgrounds and histories of officers, and these reports should be created by third-party, completely detached organizations. \n\nBSO needs to be heavily, heavily scrutinized and investigated. Maybe it\u2019s a state or federal issue I don\u2019t know. \n\nIs this even the least bit worrisome to anyone else? \n\nAre these massive issues people aware of, or are they being willfully blind to the problems I\u2019m pointing out here? \n\nI have a lot of ideas for potential solutions, as I\u2019ve been conducting extensive research into how other communities across the US are redesigning their police departments.\n\nWould love to read other people\u2019s *productive* thoughts or ideas on this topic.",

The reason you don't need experience to join BSO is because they train you, you don't get pulled over by a kid in high school.\n\nSteve Jobs has a saying:\n\n\"A players hire A players; B players hire C players; and C players hire D players. It doesn't take long to get to Z\"\n\nHire the best - no exceptions.\n\nPeople should deal with their police departments individually, it's measured by crime statistics, so far, Broward still seems safe, until it isn't, why fix what isn't broken?",

            "comment": "As someone who actually lives in Broward (this year makes 10) I completely agree, BSO is known for having many crooked and corrupt cops. There\u2019s one I see all the time, he\u2019s brown skin, bald, and I believe has a mustache over his upper lip. He\u2019s usually always talking in press conferences regarding current criminal situations, however he\u2019s been in numerous allegations regarding corruption. Yet, he\u2019s still currently working there. No paid leave, no leave of absence, none of that. Just swept under the rug. I know in Margate some of those officers are the worst, find any reason to pull you over or harass you. I believe the main issue of this, and why the requirements are so low right now is because a lot of officers are actually quitting their jobs. From everything going on regarding what happened in 2020 and the whole \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement a lot of 911 dispatchers and officers quit their job. I remember a while back I was riding the bus and a man had a seizure, as I was trying to call 911 I was *on hold*\u2026.. so yes it\u2019s bad now.",

They don\u2019t just hire 18 year olds, and give them guns and a car. I don\u2019t know how or why you are comparing the Memphis situation with here. BSO is super professional. I\u2019ve never even seen a BSO cop with anything past a 5 o Clock shadow on there face. Why are you dragging our good cops down? FYI I\u2019m no boot licker. I\u2019ve been locked up 10x in my life in my young years. I want to hate the cops too but\u2026 BSO is a pretty good organization. I love that they don\u2019t pick on you unless you really deserve it. I left a city where the cops went out of there way to make life difficult. BSO is busy dealing with real crime and doesn\u2019t bother citizens coming and going. I respect that a lot.",

Of course he has their back.\n\nWith all due respect, an article about something that took place in Memphis should not be used as an indictment of BSO, or any other police agency, without some indication of equivalency.\n\nThere are many men and women all across our country that put their lives on the line each and every day to protect and serve the public as law enforcement officers. I respect and thank them for their service and am glad that they are willing to perform such services.\n\nThat is not to say that every officer or deputy is perfect and beyond reproach. Those that do wrong need to be held accountable for their actions, without question.\n\nIf there are particular issues that warrant investigation then there are processes that are in place to accomplish that. Simply because you think something is illogical is not necessarily enough to trigger an investigation however.\n\nWhile I respect your opinion, as expressed in your email, I respectfully do not agree with your conclusions.\n\nAs a point of information I did just Google \"how hard is it to become a BSO\" and it turns out you must be 19 years of age or older.\n\nThank you for your concerns for our community.\n\nSincerely, \n\nRex Hardin \nrex@cypressprintingcenter.com",

Must be 18 years or older. . .* \n\n**Ok, hold your horror.** As it turns out, there is quite a bit more to it than just being 18 (detention deputy working in the jail is 18, you have to be 19 for road patrol deputies) and **having a face and a pulse.** \n\nYou can't just stop at item #1 - as you did. Also, the key word is REQUIRED. While not every candidate has zero experience, many do. Some are former military police or came from other civilian agencies.\n\nBefore you can even apply for a job with BSO, you have to have a Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE)[Basic Recruit Certificate of Compliance](http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/CJSTC/Officer-Requirements/How-to-Become-an-Officer.aspx) **which is not an easy get.**\n\nMeet the Minimum Qualifications established in s. 943.13 Florida Statutes (The employing agency will document and verify)\r  \n\r  \nBe at least 19 years of age for law enforcement and correctional probation.\r  \n\r  \nBe at least 18 years of age for corrections.\r  \n\r  \nBe a citizen of the United States.\r  \n\r  \nHave earned a high school graduate or equivalent (GED).

If you don't pass, (I saw 79% as minimum on most LEO sites) you don't get that paper.\n\n**THEN you fill out the app with BSO and begin their interview process.**\n\nTHEN you have to pass their physical and :\n\nAn evaluation of training and experience\r  \nA written test\r  \nA computer-based test\r  \nAn interview\r  \n**A polygraph examination**\r  \n**A psychological evaluation**\r  \nFingerprint and background check\r  \nMedical examination\r  \n**Drug screen**\r  \nThe expected length of the **selection process is 12 to 16 weeks.** \n\nThis is on **top of 3-6 months in the academy and who knows how long on other stuff to meet the quals.**\n\nAll in ? call it a year.\n\nSo, OP - it's not a *'I was driving by and it looked like a nice place to use the bathroom, maybe I should apply for a job - hee hee* ' sort of gig. \n\nWhat would you add to this to satisfy you? \n\nAs I stated elsewhere, I think you should apply yourself if you feel so strongly about it - consider it going undercover , you could rise through the ranks and become head of IAB - fix the problem from the inside.\n\nBut I don't think you are so inspired to undertake the above, nor do I think you would pass.",

Even though the US has way, way higher numbers than the rest of the world, its only proportionally. In absolute terms, the number of kids hurt by school shootings is absurdly low. The amount of bombings is nonexistent. These are threats and not realities. \n\nEvery security guard is one less teacher. Every drill is another stress that warps their perception of reality. That is what actually hurts students. \n\nWe only care about the sensational. If we really cared about the safety of schools, we wouldn't even consider for one second opening them during Covid. That is a threat orders of magnitude more life-threatening.",

Parents are the worst, everything is subjective based on emotional ties, and it is school policy causing more problems that it solves.\n\nThis is my problem with voting for people who have that baggage. \n\nGoing through a tragedy does not necessarily make you an expert in the issues that lead to that tragedy. Not sure what about someone's spouse/child getting shot qualifies them on the complexities of rolling out security measures for an education system. It could, in fact, work against them as emotional attachment far outweighs expertise in the matter, leading to highly biased an ineffective results... which is the current plague of the BCPS, and by extension, much tof the US public school system\n\nThere is a good reason kids 8-20 are the most anxious, stress-prone, and medicated age group in the Western World, and it is NOT because we are being objective, factual, and even-minded about our \"solutions.\"\n\nFor me, the #1 issue with the school system, IS the school system itself. I support Education, but this is no longer education. Every year is a new fear that leads to new procedures that take over from the fundamental issues schools should be addressing... education. \n\nBullying issues, gender issues, identity issues, gun issues, violence issues, and now covid, when we have barely gotten off the ground with Shooting Drills, all based of bad data and sensational news.... guess what, you have convinced me US Schools are too dangerous.\n\nAnd then what do they say when they fail at all this... well, we needed more money - BULLSHIT - US kids are the best funded per-capita in the western world.",

He also runs a math curriculum himself, something Public Schools don't seem to do so well.\n\nDixon is more of the same, nothing new or different, and supported by the same people who can't manage ANY disasters thrown at them.,\n\nFor Soil and Water - Segal - Broward water was in a rut and Segal has made it better, not worse, so for that I think I will keep him in, unless there is some glaring reason to hire an inexperience 18 year old over someone demonstrating results.  \n\n\nA1 - Yes. Citizenship is already the case, making the linguistics specific is what every fact-loving individual should be striving for. I have NO idea how this gets spun as Xenophobic.\n\nA2 - Yes. Goes without saying, this should happen faster\n\nA3 -  No. I have been dying for open primaries, but the top-two strategy is still manipulating the vote and not at all in the spirit of what a real open primary should be.\n\nA4 - No. I am not a fan of putting everything as an Amendment, but if people voted via 60% majority, then that is that. No need to do it twice, that is the epitome of government waste.\n\nA6 - Yes. It is a minor thing for the city, a major thing for the family.",

            "comment": "My point of view of Gunther...they are the only Mazda dealership I'd go to, and I live 5 mins from Mazda of North Miami. The waiting area is comfortable. Plenty of seating, exceptional customer service... \nNow to my experience with them with a pricy repair... \nBought a 2015 Mazda5 minivan with 55k miles on it in 2020 from a private dealership. Took it to Gunther, have done oil changes, tranmission fluid changes, tires, alignments, balance etc...I did brakes privately.  \nIn 2022, I started feeling a pulse in the wheels while driving and accelerating. I went for ride with my advisor, Sergio. He stated he was a mechanic and got promoted to advisor. He suggested I get a \"diagnosis\", check out the suspension etc. I did it, and the great thing about Gunther Mazda is that they provide a video of the undercarriage and top of the engine bay. The inspection showed that the shocks, struts, and bearings needed replacing (a weak part of the Mazda5, being that it's built on a Mazda3 platform but weighs 600lbs more than the Mazda3). Gave me a quote, I returned a few weeks later and did the wheel bearings. Got it back 2 days later, and still felt a pulse, this time, some more vibration than before. Took it back, turns out there was a failure with the part. Left it for a few days, got it back with a new bearing and hub... Drove it to my mechanics house where other suspension work was going to get done and asked him to drive it. He drove it and guess what, the bearings were bad again. Not only that, this time, the CV joints were damaged. Also, the last retaining nut when assembing the bearing was missing! So, I called Sergio, advised him of the issue. He immediately sent out a tow truck, I got another loaner and after a few days, my car was returned...\nAll of this sounds bad, but what I'm saying is, that dispite all of the back and forth, Sergio at Gunther Mazda made it right. They installed 2 new CV joints, new bearings, and gave me the warranty on the parts.\n\nI need to make a follow up appointment for my transmission fluid, it's at 93k miles now.",

Tricks like that\n\nhttps://my.caredge.com/",

A lot of sites actually show transparency and give you all three costs: lease, financing, and OTD price. So I will have a quote in hand when I go in. Thanks.",

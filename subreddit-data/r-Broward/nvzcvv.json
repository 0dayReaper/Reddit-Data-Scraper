    "postText": " \n\nHey folks,\n\nYour friendly local investigative journalist here. I and the team over at The Sun Sentinel spent the past few months digging deep into the use of police dogs in Broward County. We found that 84 percent of people bitten were Black. The dogs are indispensable for finding and capturing dangerous criminals, police say. However, more than 60% of the people bitten during the 17 month period we examined were suspected of nonviolent crimes. And 1/5 of the individuals bitten were minors.\n\nHere's a link to the story:\n\n[https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-ne-police-unleash-k9s-on-black-men-20210609-72eykhou3beedige2kr6nsedbi-htmlstory.html](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-ne-police-unleash-k9s-on-black-men-20210609-72eykhou3beedige2kr6nsedbi-htmlstory.html)\n\nPlease consider subscribing and supporting local journalism!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0fxkb1bij9471.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=21c668116a14f996d8184a2bf1ca039613b65b63",

The article is pointing out that trough their research the dos are biting black peoples disproportionately. Ex. If ten criminals and pursued by K-9 units. 5 black and 5 non black If they all run and 5 bites occur. The result would be that 4-5 of the  black criminals were bitten and maybe 1 of the others based on the stats given in the article.  If their research is accurate then this would show a definite disparity in the use of K-9 units against black suspects.",

The Floyd murder was an atrocious and heinous abuse of power that should've never happened and thank God the officer was convicted for his crime. The flip side of that coin is that since that incident criminals have been turned into victims. \n\nThis is unacceptable. No matter the color of your skin, if you commit a crime you should be prosecuted. Victims of crime are now being victimized twice. First by the offender and 2nd by the justice system that does not want to be called out as racist by the media.\n\nIt's an effed-up time we live in now.",

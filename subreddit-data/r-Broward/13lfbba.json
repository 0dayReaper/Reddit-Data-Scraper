[this is FREEBEE](https://ridefreebee.com/local-business/) which is supported by area businesses to promote their business by enhancing access.\n\nFor the Sunrise/Sawgrass area, it's specific to a few area hotels, the mall, the Arena, Publix etc. IMAX etc \n\n[Freebee is also in other higher rent zip codes](https://ridefreebee.com/service-areas/) like Aventura, coral gables, key biscayne, pinecrest, Miami Beach, Lauderdale by the Sea, etc",

[you can read more about it here.](https://www.sunrisefl.gov/departments-services/leisure-services/transportation) This is mostly for elderly folks trying to get to the doctor or out to shop. They have nowhere to go and all day to get there. read: it's no replacement for uber to get to work.\n\n[Also, apparently they DO have something to do with the FREEBEE service out there,](https://www.sunrisefl.gov/departments-services/city-manager/economic-development/freebee) they mention it on their website. They say it is operated by freebee and is partially funded by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). It is unclear if Sunrise provides any funding directly.",

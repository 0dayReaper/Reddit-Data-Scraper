Who knew a guy, fresh out of jail, would go steal a car in Ocala, drive down to Davie and break into our storefront? Then drive back up only to be caught in a high speed chase?\n\nThe news didn't air it but we wanted to thank the Davie Police and all cooperating agencies who caught him. Now let's see if we can figure out why, because it makes no fucking sense.",

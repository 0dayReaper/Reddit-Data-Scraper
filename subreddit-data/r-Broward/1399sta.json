                    "comment": "I would like to know how this is relevant for the situation. Wearing a mask and mandating clear bags are two different things. A mask does not affect the majority of people, nor does it matter to them. In fact, it actually helps with safety and made many feel safer during COVID.\n\nA clear bag mandate, on the other hand, has many issues associated with it. For one, it removes the privacy of students to begin with. Anything in their bag can be seen. Things can be stolen, students can be bullied, etc. Additionally, all of the bags will look the same, so that one kid who doesn't write their name on it (or that one kid who doesn't read a name) will end up stealing a bag or getting a bag stolen.\n\nSecond, plastic/vinyl clear bags are not nearly as high quality as traditional bags as well as not having nearly enough utility. All of my friends (yes, all of them) would not be able to put every material they currently have in one of those bags. Even if they could, there is little to no organization in them.\n\nThe most important factor is that it's a blatant \"we don't trust you\" to the children. Mental health, the majority of the time, is the reason for school shootings. Making students feel distrusted will only lessen their mental health, making the problem worse. All of the other factors will contribute to this as well as they will feel like they are being controlled.\n\nAll that this mandate will do is make problems worse. It's like putting just a band-aid on an infection. Do you still think that the mask mandate is the same?",

For example,  we now know that healthy kids were not at risk from covid and studies show that the masks were ineffective.  \nBut don't diminish the down side of masking. You don't think wearing a rag over your face all day, breathing in your own CO2, not being able to see peoples faces and facial expressions affects health, both mental and physical? I'd say the deleterious effects of masking kids all day is far worse than a perceived loss of privacy, which btw, they don't have and shouldn't be led to believe they do.  No privacy at school. So they should leave their expensive electronics, knives, and drug paraphernalia, handguns and other goodies at home and instead just carry that which they need to learn.\n\nBut you are right,  I don't still think they are the same. The toll from masking will be much greater than clear backpacks will ever be.",

                                    "comment": "First off, you don't breathe in nearly enough CO2 to harm you when wearing a mask. It feels greater as the best within the mask is increased by your breathing, but the claim that it is a harmful amount has been disproven. Second, you are correct about not seeing people's faces and expressions, but students were easily able to adapt to this. Not being able to see people's expressions was better than the previous year of virtual school. Additionally, after the mask mandate was lifted, many students still wore masks (including me) out of concern for our safety. Also, masks are proven to have an effect on safety and have been proven to work, and while children are not at a high risk they can still get COVID-19. \n\nA concerning thing with this reply is that you are ignoring everything I said except the privacy bit. Students should have privacy and do have it to an extent. Just because they don't have enough doesn't mean we should reduce it more instead of fixing it. Go read my reply again and actually counter the other points.\n\nThe focus should be on mental health and restrictions on guns. The more concerning part is that the students want to get weapons and are somehow able to. We should fix that, not mandate clear bags as a stalling method.",

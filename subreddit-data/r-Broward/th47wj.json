            "comment": "&gt;A Florida bus driver is being hailed for her quick actions after a gunman opened fire on a transit bus Thursday, fatally shooting two people and wounding two others.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The shooting occurred around 3:30 p.m. while the Broward County Transit bus was traveling on West Broward Boulevard. The unnamed driver heard several gunshots and pulled into the parking lot of the Fort Lauderdale police station**, authorities said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"We had an officer on an unrelated call in front of the police station. He, too, heard several gunshots coming from within the bus,\" interim police Chief Luis Alvarez said at a news conference.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One person was pronounced dead on the bus, and a second person died at the hospital, according to authorities. Two others remain hospitalized in unknown conditions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Alvarez said the bus driver's actions likely saved lives.\n\nYeah, that driver is badass",

    "postText": "BCPS cherry-picked MSD as the only school to have program/enrollment adjustment this year and is now trying to push through a plan to move only 88 kids per year from MSD due to unsubstantiated \u201csafety\u201d concerns brought to the District by vocal Parkland parents. The process has been driving toward this solution even though BCPS acknowledged it didn\u2019t follow the rules. Write to your school Board Rep that you don\u2019t support special treatment for one school or for one community.",

Families with younger kids that moved there will be sending those kids to high school in the coming years and there is no other school as close as Douglas to send them to, and literally nothing but Everglades to the north and west of those neighborhoods. They\u2019d have to drive past Douglas (through its school zone traffic even) to get to any other school.",

Residents in east Parkland could drive straight there without passing MSD. If the community growth is shared the schools should be also!",

Is that your logic?\n\n\\- what do you base your understanding on, as to the level of risk to children?  How do you address that life has other greater risks that we live with every day, like the seasonal flu (as to children specifically here) and driving on the highway?   \n\n\\- what is the end goal with masking now ... do you believe we're going to stop covid with our cloth masks and we can all take our masks off in another year, and covid won't be waiting to come back for the unvaccinated as people travel around the globe and as new variants emerge in response to the vaccine (the natural selection problem)?  Hence if we just were careful enough now, it will go away completely?  I'd love to believe that was still possible.  Or do we do this masking thing forever?  Maybe you anticipate another vaccine or cure that we are waiting for?\n\nThanks for good faith responses and not resorting to insult if you got the sense that I'm not in favor of masking up our kids another year.  I respect others' opinions and sometimes in this process of discussion my own views change.  Open minded here.",

Unfortunately, your 6 cited articles do not say that.  I read them all.  Those articles describe alleged myths, such as \"masks do not work at all\" and then debunk them.  That's a strawman argument.  What reasonable person believes masks do literally nothing?  It does not advance this discussion to mis-state positions in the extreme and then make obvious rebuttal.  People who do that are talking right past each other and it is maddening.  My question whether whether you acknowledge that masks so have \\*some downside risk\\*.  None of your sources said masks have zero negative impact.  \n\nYou didn't ask, but I'll share my inexpert observations that differ from yours.  I think mask wearing has made us less social and less friendly.  Smiles are not shared.  Nuances in communication related to facial expression are impossible.  It is harder to hear, and in many instances we just don't try.  I miss faces.  That's a downside - but maybe its trivial.  Also, my son is the kind of kid who is terrible at picking up social cues in human interaction.  Social distancing and masks hinder his ability to learn the cues of facial expression and encourage isolation \u2013 a condition he is happy with, but that is not beneficial for healthy development.  I suspect other kids too are having their social development delayed by face coverings and distancing.  If I'm right, that's a downside.  And I won't bother citing you to  all the obvious articles you can find about cloth masks harboring germs and virus and whether they actually increase the spread of the virus the way we use them and touch them.  I noticed more \"experts\" opining against masks around March 2020 - I'm sure you know why and it had nothing to do with truth.\n\nPlease answer my last question - what do you expect to happen if we all mask up?  Will covid go away?  If fewer people get it this month, because of masks, will not more people get it in future months when we eventually take off the masks?  If not, why - what would be differennt in future months?  What makes you think we can stop covid from running its course?  If covid is going to run its course anyway and your masking is just delaying the inevitable and drawing out the process, maybe it is you who should \"suck it up buttercup\"?  \n\nThanks -",

I get that you kid may not do as well in a mask as she would without, but how will she do with long term lung damage or other potential long term illness as a result of a covid infection. Is it worth the gamble? \nTo answer your last question, if we all mask up and we finally get a solid majority of people vaccinated, we have a chance of stopping the virus from mutating further into  more potentially deadly or contagious versions. In my opinion, the virus is here for the duration, what we need to do is stay ahead of the spread until the vaccines can catch up and we can all get yearly boosters like many of us get for influenza, and shingles, etc...if we let the virus run rampant it will overrun our emergency rooms and hospitals and we all know what happns then. \nIt's already causing elective surgeries to be delayed or cancelled. That's things like cancer biopsies. \n\n\n I cannot fathom how an outbreak of a deadly virus became a political wedge issue and a bizarre conspiracy instead of a simple public health issue like polio, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, shingles, etc...\n\nWhy do people have to make everything a part of a ridiculous culture war. Just wear a mask, get vaccinated and go on about your day. It's not that damned hard. Millions of other people are doing it every day and the vaccines have been shown I've the past 8 months to be largely effective and have few side effects overall. The whole anti-vax anti -mask stance makes no rational sense.",

I'll address your points and questions from my limited perspective.\n\n***\"Masks have been shown to reduce transmission. Especially when used in conjunction with frequent hand washing. What other facts do you need?\"***\n\nOf course.  No serious person doubts that masks have some level of efficacy.  And of course covid represents a risk.  But we don't make rational decisions on the basis that we eliminate all risk or that we use every method with more than zero efficacy.  If we did, we would not drive over 25 mph, and we would not build bridges.  Those things are dangerous and easily avoided.  We chose rationally to accept certain risks by weighing all the issues in comparison to each other.  An intelligent analysis weight at least three questions:\n\n1. how effective are masks?  Clearly they help to some degree.  Good!   \nBut hopefully we can agree that masks as most people wear them (cloth for extended periods, and then touched and replaced) have limited efficacy.  They stop some larger droplets.  That's far from 100%.  The answer is somewhere in the middle.   \n2. how big is the risk being protected against ... cutting through the bad data, what is the *real risk* to children from covid.  The CDC reports \"deaths with COVID\", but we need to know \"deaths from COVID\".  And we need to know how may of those deaths were healthy kids verses ones with serious comorbidities.  The risk is clearly more than zero, but how much?  It matters to how we respond.  Is the COVID risk actually less than the risk of seasonal flue?  Comparing deaths from a typical flu season to those from COVID suggests so.  \n3. what weighs in the counterbalance, as downside risk from extended mask wearing.  I agree with you it is small.  But it is not zero either.\n\nHere's a doctor who can put it far better than I can.  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/masks-children-parenting-schools-mandates-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-biden-administration-cdc-11628432716](https://www.wsj.com/articles/masks-children-parenting-schools-mandates-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-biden-administration-cdc-11628432716)\n\nHopefully you can get behind the paywall.  The author Marty MaCary is far more qualified than either of us on this subject.  Of course I'm aware of other experts advocating for masks on children.  The problem is I want more than to be told what to do.  I expect *reasoned* opinions citing authorities and weighing the competing factors intelligently.  Instead I just see single issue arguments like \"masks work\" or \"covid is dangerous\" or emotional pleas like \"you're killing people if you don't comply\".  Those are not rational arguments and they are not how to decide personal or public policy.\n\n***\"if we let the virus run rampant it will overrun our emergency rooms and hospitals and we all know what happens then.\"***\n\nLet me say that I agree with you on this point.  If an outbreak threatens to exceed our ability to treat it, then needless deaths will occur and stricter means are called for.  I'm not sure that is happening based on numbers, or that it can with existing levels of immunity from vaccination and from prior cases.  But I agree in principle with you at least.  That's why people overwhelmingly supported \"15 days to flatten the curve\".\n\n***\"I cannot fathom how an outbreak of a deadly virus became a political wedge issue ...  Why do people have to make everything a part of a ridiculous culture war.*** \n\nI'm sure there are bad faith players out there who profit from stoking fear and politicizing this issue.  And media plays to the clicks (revenue) which come from pleasing their partisan bases, so media is wildly divided and most people have not figured out to get multiple sources of news.  So all that contributes greatly to this division.\n\nHOWEVER, there is a more natural answer to your question that does not require a conspiracy.  People have different world views and values, and I'm sure that many people  come down on different sides of this issue, in good faith, because of those different value systems.  Examples - people have different views of the importance of collective rights verses individual rights.  People evaluate risks differently (some are more risk averse than others), and value freedoms differently.  Also some people trust authority and governmental proclamations, and some immediately distrust them and are highly skeptical.  And the same world view differences that dictate political affiliation also influence opinions on subjects like vaccines, mandates, and masks.  So, as we line up in political camps, the issue appears political.",

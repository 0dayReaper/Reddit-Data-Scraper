I am a lifelong Democrat and generally am on the more progressive side of the party (voted for Bernie and Warren in the previous primaries). Although it\u2019s easy to write Crist off as a \u201cformer Republican\u201d I believe he was actually a very good governor who generally just did what was right for Florida regardless of traditional party lines. He certainly wasn\u2019t right EVERY time. But, if I\u2019m being honest, id vote for him with MUCH less trepidation than when I voted for Hillary or Biden. I truly believe he\u2019s a politician who just wants to do right for Florida\u2026 and he was even when he was a Republican.",

Smith](https://twitter.com/CarlosGSmith)** have endorsed Crist.  The fact that Fried couldn't get those two must-have endorsements clearly indicates that Fried will not be the nominee.  \n   \nHolness himself has been honest.  On the other hand, **[this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Broward/comments/vvl0eu/did_sheila_cherfilusmccormick_buy_her_seat_with/)** indicates that Cherfilus-McCormick herself has not.  \n  \nAramis Alaya is known for being removed from office because she categorically refused to prosecute death penalty cases.  With all the \"Lower Georgia\" voters Florida has, Alaya is very unlikely to beat Moody.   As for Jim Lewis,  \n  \n&gt; *Lewis has run for office \u2014 as a Democrat, as a Republican and as an independent/no party affiliation candidate \u2014 many times before.  Among the jobs he\u2019s sought previously: state attorney general, Broward state attorney (twice), Broward public defender, Fort Lauderdale mayor, Fort Lauderdale city commissioner, circuit judge and state representative. He\u2019s never won.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt; *This is Lewis\u2019 second candidacy for attorney general. In 2010, he received 3.8% of the vote as a an independent/NPA candidate for the job, receiving 199,147 votes \u2014 out of 5.3 million votes cast that year in the race for attorney general.*   \n&gt;   \n&gt; *In 2020, he ran as a Democrat for his party\u2019s nomination for Broward state attorney. He received, 9,885 votes, finishing seventh in an eight-candidate Democratic primary, with 4.8% of the vote.*    \n&gt;  \n&gt; *In 2012, he ran for state attorney as a Republican, appearing on the ballot as \u201cJim Lewis.\u201d*   \n   \nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/fort-lauderdale-s-perennial-political-candidate-jim-lewis-is-running-again-this-time-for-florida-attorney-general/ar-AATHtum\n   \nLewis is a very weak candidate.  Uhlfelder, though:  \n   \n&gt; *I will do what I have done for my entire life \u2013 advocate for voting rights, consumer rights, and fundamental human rights \u2013 to help Florida families.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt; *I was the first non-minority member of the Okaloosa County Branch of the NAACP, and served as Chair of the Legal Redress Committee. I was awarded the NAACP's Foot Soldier in the Sand Award for my work in the area of civil rights.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt; *In 2015, Confederate flags began coming down off of state houses and courthouses all across the country, but not the county courthouse I argued cases in every day. So I organized to take it down, never wavering in the face of death threats from near and far.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt; *In 2018, when bureaucrats and politicians in Tallahassee voted to privatize tens of miles of beaches so they could keep others out of their expensive beachfront properties, I called out the hypocrisy. I protested the unconstitutional laws that kept average people from enjoying the natural wonders our state had to offer. No one, I argued, should be able to use political connections to keep people off of public lands, especially the beaches of North Florida.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt; *And in 2020, when I watched my neighbors dying as a result of a deadly pandemic, I put on a costume and walked the beaches to encourage people to stay home. My activism generated national news, and retaliation from the Governor who wanted to silence me for expressing my first amendment rights to try to keep the people of Florida safe.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt; *I have been an extremely vocal critic of DeSantis\u2019 and Moody\u2019s policies, which have led not only to deaths, but undermined access to medicine for patients, contributed to increasing environmental damage, and hurt consumers across the state.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt; *I am running for Attorney General because for the last 4 years, this Governor and Attorney General have been more interested in bullying those they don\u2019t agree with than helping Florida families. I am running to ensure that the people of Florida have the fierce advocate they deserve.*  \n   \nhttps://www.danielforag.com/why-im-running",

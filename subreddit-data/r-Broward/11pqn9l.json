    "postText": "Moved back to Florida after almost ten years and looking to buy a house in a few years. Interested in buying a place on the Middle River where my backyard will have a dock there (or I build one).\n\nI want to know the question to my answer. Is the Middle River safe enough to jet ski and kayak?\n\nI know it ultimatly connects to the New River/ocean and it starts from the Everglades. But the area that I'm looking to buy is between the turnpike and 441, which cuts through a lot of neighborhoods and businesses. The water isn't blue like the ocean or as crisp looking as downtown ft Lauderdale though.\n\nIt looks kind of murky at times, not necessarily filled with litter or dirty, just not blue and paradise looking like the ocean. If I had to guess I would say maybe it's like 10 feet deep? The only wildlife I see are ducks and fish. I feel like it's far away from the Everglades and the ocean to see any crazy type of wildlife like alligators or sharks.\n\nThere's never any boat traffic except for workers doing maintenance on roadways underneath and such.\n\nI don't plan on swimming in it, but if I'm going to have a river run through my backyard , I would at least like to use it right?  I would only be in the water if I fall off a kayak or jet ski. Anyone know if the water is clean enough for said activities?",

I'm sure there are some locks further down the river but between the turnpike and 441 there's almost 5 miles (I googled mapped it) of uninterrupted river.\n\nI'm sure there's even more uninterrupted river east of 441 too. But I'm sure I'm not going to go that far down.",

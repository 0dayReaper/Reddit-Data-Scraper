Prices would be exactly the same today if trump was president. The American economy, the oil companies are not beholden to the president. I think it\u2019s just completely and utterly ignorant how people like you will blame every little thing on the president when it\u2019s a dem in office but then do the complete opposite when it\u2019s a Republican.\n\nOil prices are up all over the world. How in the hell is Biden controlling the price of oil in Europe ? Or Australia ? Or Japan? He is not because oil is a huge complex commodity that is priced by the market. The only entity that has the ability to slightly affect oil prices is OPEC and they are purposefully limiting production to keep prices high.\n\nAnd that entire speech of Leninism is garbage. Complete and utter garbage. The democrats are just as corporatist as republicans. The democrats go out of their way to protect American corporations. Your ignorance is overflowing go do some research on macroeconomics and commodities and OPEC and actually learn something important.",

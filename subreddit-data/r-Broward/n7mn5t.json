South beach in Miami consistently had smooth water, but if you want to stay in Broward, you'll have to check the weather for wind speed and choppiness.\n\nYou can also dig out a section of sand to pool the water into a safe spot.",

A few days ago the ocean was very still but it will be a bit rougher with 1 or 2 footers this weekend.  \n\nMagicseaweed.com.  go there and you can get surf reports for anywhere, so just look for where the wave height is around 0 ft.",

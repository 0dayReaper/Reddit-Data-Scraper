    "postText": "I have a very small Fire Extinguisher service company and I'm looking for a small cheap piece of land somewhere in Broward county. The plan is to drop a shipping container and create a small shop where I can recharge the fire extinguishers and at the same time create a legal business location.  I don't need much even an 8ft shipping container would be more then enough space.",

For example, there are a few mechanics and other small businesses operating out of garages near Royal Palm and 441 in Margate. 2030 NW 55th Ave\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/oKPDHqRx4aftYmi18\n\nThere are literally hundreds of places like this all over Broward. Even a few storage units that get used as businesses.",

Idk the rules on running a business, (there is a POA) but I know someone who lives there and gets a prevoius owners mail who ran a remodeling business at the address. Might be worth looking into.",

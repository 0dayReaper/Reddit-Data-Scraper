            "comment": "Unrelated, but I went to the one in Davie once and felt like I was treated like a second-class citizen just because I was ordering takeout.  I went inside and they immediately hustled me out a side door to go to a walk-up window in the back, where they hand you the food and then ask you to pay while juggling everything, with not even a small shelf to sign the receipt on, and there's no shade or protection from the weather either.  It was a mild day but I certainly wouldn't want to wait out there in the height of summer or while it was raining.  The inside of the restaurant was completely empty too.\n\nThere *is* an arrow on the window that points to the right and says TAKEOUT, but if you're approaching from the left where most of the available parking is, you might not even see it.  And when I did see it as I was already opening the door, I assumed it meant go inside and go to the right where the cash register used to be when it was a Burger 21.  All around it seems a very poorly thought out place.",

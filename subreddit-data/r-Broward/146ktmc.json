They just need an example of an exact property that has one in the room/place they will be staying in as a lot don\u2019t have a router in every room. Extended stays and month to months have remote routers mostly",

It's a small box that connects to WiFi and has an ethernet jack.  You plug into that ethernet jack and voila - you're set.  The ethernet connection has no real construct for the pathways of the connection, so it should work just fine and then you have limitless options and no long cables strewn about.",

With the coupon right now it's $30. \nhttps://amzn.to/3NnKwEX\n\nI understand the struggle, as I work from all over the place, including ships.

            "comment": "I wanted to take a moment to fill you in on a little bit that's been happening behind the scenes at Mojo Donuts. Basically, there was a business deal between the owner and founder of Mojo Donuts in Pembroke Pines, Shawn, with this guy in Miami. I don't know the full details of the story, but the deal went sort of south, and they've been on the outs. Recently, without authorization, the dude who owns the Miami locations began putting out political propaganda shilling for Carlos Jiminez on local TV, who if you don't know, is, without trying to go into a political rant myself, a politically divisive figure.\n\nThis was completely unauthorized by the original owner and founder, who made it a point to never make any political statements, or alienate anyone with politically leaning messages on any advertising or social media.\n\nI implore you to spread the word here, and help Shawn get more eyes on this, because it's really not cool what this other guy is doing to Shawn's vision for his own company.",

Now that I see this it only reinforces, \"MOJO Donuts = Politics\" I don't give a shit about owners, arguments, mayors or whatever, if I want donuts and coffee, now I wont walk into a place that represents something political, right or wrong.",

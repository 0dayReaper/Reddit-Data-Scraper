In the 2020 tax year, there were 1,254 properties in Broward County with that classification.\"\n\nFound the contradiction on Marty's website \" However, it is not enough to grow fruit or vegetables for your own use or keep a pet cow or only your own horses for pleasure or sport. While the \u201ccommercial\u201d requirement is not as strict as the IRS business standards, you should be trying to make money from the agricultural use of your land. \"\n\nI'm going to grow an orange tree and sell the oranges!\n\nI hope that one day, Church's have to pay their fair share of property tax. The crap they pull with the endless properties they're accumulating is ridiculous.",

                    "comment": "I think their argument stems from it's not just *that specific land and cow* according to the article, they have other land and other cows including an aggressive bull, and their using the areas near the church bambi is on as a \"seclusion area\" for smaller cows to protect them from the bull which right now only includes Bambi, and that in conjunction with the other cows, parcels of land, and receipts constitutes an agricultural business. Which in my opinion is valid. Though also in my opinion churches shouldn't be exempt from taxes so fuck em regardless.",

                            "comment": "That's not how it works.  For that specific property, having this \"seclusion area\" amounts to having a pet cow.  That property's main use is as a church, and it should be taxed accordingly.  If they want a seclusion area on a particular property which actually has agriculture as its main use, that can be easily accomplished by installing a fence within that genuinely agricultural property.",

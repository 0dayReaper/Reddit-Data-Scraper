Preferably free. Preferably shallow incase we flip lol.",

            "comment": "I canoe a lot, for an easy safe launch I like Holland park in Hollywood. If you make a right into the lake it\u2019s a motor free zone so no jetski or boats to look out for and it\u2019s not too deep. You can go as far as you feel comfortable. \n\nThey ask have a paddle craft specific launch that the crew teams use. \n\nOleta River and west lake park also have launches but you have to pay. \n\nThere are a few others but I wouldn\u2019t consider them beginner launches, or boat test launches since they have more current and less people around. \n\nOnce you have it down then sky is the limit, there is a really nice launch in Virginia key, as well as one by deering estate in Miami that I love taking people to, not broward but really cool. \n\nYou can also launch off of 75, or 27 but there are tons of boats and you need a 10 foot flag on the boat to not get a ticket or run over by an airboat. \n\nFeel free to DM if you have more specific questions.",

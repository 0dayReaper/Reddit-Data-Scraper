    "postText": "\nRon DeSantis Backs Down in Mask Mandate Dispute With Florida Schools\n\nBY\u00a0JACK DUTTON\u00a0ON 8/13/21 AT 4:55 AM EDT\n\n\nOn July 30 the Republican lawmaker signed an executive order \"ensuring parents' freedom to choose\" whether their child wears a mask. However, two Florida districts\u2014Alachua and Broward counties\u2014have defied this rule and made masks mandatory in school unless the child can provide a doctor's note, as COVID-19 hospitalizations increase in the state.\n\nGov. DeSantis's office responded by saying the state's Board of Education could move to withhold salaries from the superintendent or school board members.\n\n\nBut the governor's office softened its stance on Friday, acknowledging that the state has no control over local employees' pay.\n\nA spokesperson for DeSantis called on \"activists, anti-science school board members\" to dock their own salaries if the state follows through with financial sanctions against their district.\n\n\"Those officials should own their decision\u2014and that means owning the consequences of their decisions rather than demanding students, teachers, and school staff to foot the bill for their potential grandstanding,\" Christina Pushaw, the governor's press secretary, wrote in an email to the\u00a0Miami Herald\u00a0and\u00a0Tampa Bay Times.",

So he has resorted to begging them to not pay themselves instead of just making a budget thats a couple of hundred thousand shorter spread across the school district (which is like 2 billion dollars total)",

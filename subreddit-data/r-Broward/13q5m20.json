I need to do my roof and I\u2019m so worried I\u2019m going to be forced to redo the travertine my home came with \ud83d\ude2d. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with this? \n\nIf I get my roof done, will the inspector ask me if my travertine is unpermitted?\n\nAny inspectors that can speak to this?\n\nI wish I can give it back, honestly. I don\u2019t want to be a homeowner anymore.",

            "comment": "I think you are overthinking it. The roofing inspector would not think twice about the pavers unless they were being installed while they were there. No permit for the pavers isn't a big deal. It sounds like they permitted the important stuff which is good. \n\nJust for clarification the pavers are unpermitted so the city doesn't know anything about them. An open permit is a permitted job that was never completed or never finalized by the contractor. \n\nNever pay a contractor in full until you have a finalized permit.",

I think I am too. \n\nWe\u2019re dealing with a room that is an addition that WAS PERMITTED - yet the room was so poorly built, it\u2019s crazy. I don\u2019t know who signed off on it. It was a porch that they converted to a room, but they put dirt on the porch original concrete and then piled a slab of concrete on it (my guess is to save money? They were trying to make that room the same height as the main home). They left the wall frame surrounded by dirt and a gutter next to the room. So whenever it would get wet the wall framing gets wet. I was simply trying to replace the tile and found all of this. IStucco and wall frame completely rotted. We found black mold even though mold inspection came back with no mold. I haven\u2019t been able to move in yet.",

The inspector will not care one bit about that. He will look at exactly what he is there for unless...unless he noticed something egregious and potentially harmful. Standard travertine floor would not be it. Loose electrical wires exposed would be. \n\nMake sure you tell your roofer you want a roof that gets you maximum deduction on your hurricane insurance. It makes a huge difference.",

Are \u201copen permits\u201d and \u201cunpermitted work\u201d the same? I mean I would think it\u2019s obvious you shouldn\u2019t sell a home with unpermitted work but we are in south Florida and I didn\u2019t know my travertine pavers needed a permit, otherwise I would have called it out. I hope you\u2019re right. They did replace the windows to impact windows and that\u2019s permitted, but my travertine looks newer than my windows which are from 2021. Maybe I\u2019m stressing about nothing \ud83e\udd7a",

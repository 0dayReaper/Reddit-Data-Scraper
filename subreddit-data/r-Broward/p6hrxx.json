Trivia nights/game nights/paddle boarding, etc. Just thought maybe I'm not looking in the right places - tried meetup but didn't seem too active. Thanks!",

Starts at 8, but really got to get there around 7 to get a table. Great food and drinks, too. I go with a few friends sometimes. \n\nRedball social is a kickball league that has a FTL league starting next month: http://www.redballsocial.com/leagues/kickball",

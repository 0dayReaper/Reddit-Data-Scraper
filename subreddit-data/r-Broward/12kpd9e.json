    "postText": " \n\nDoes anyone know off hand if any dentists in the area carry this?\n\nWe've been ordering it from our previous dentist's office out-of-state, but it's a huge inconvenience for them, and the shipping is expensive. For some reason, the company doesn't allow non-dentists to purchase it directly - it's not a prescription item so I'm not sure why that is, but it's the best dang mouth rinse I've ever used, and I'd love to be able to find it here. \n\nThanks in advance!",

It is now back up, and I have reached out to them, but they do not have an ability to give me the information. \n\nThat being said, do you know of a dentist that carries this product.  If not, then stop wasting my time with your very unhelpful suggestions.",
